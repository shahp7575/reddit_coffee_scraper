I looked in the mirror and I didn’t recognize myself, you didn’t either. “I was lazy, I let myself go, I stopped caring.” It was so subtle I barely noticed and when I did I stood staring at a lifeless version of myself dressed in my usual sweats, messy bun, no makeup and sadness engulfing my eyes. I was questioning what happened, how could I let it happen. I was once vivacious, ambitious, fun, lively, adventurous, happy and the person I stared at, showed zero of those qualities. 

I believed those things about myself, I was lazy, I let myself go, I stopped caring but those were only the stump of a much bigger root. You were emotionally lazy, you let me go, you stopped caring. I had a career, I ate healthy, worked out, partied, I was everything you wanted. Then I gave up my dream job so you could start your dream career in another city and so that we could start a family. I’d be a stay at home mom to save money and so our children would grow up with a parent who loved them and be safe from the unpredictable but at the end of it all, all I became was invisible. 

I cleaned, I cooked, I paid the bills, took care of all things related to the kids and I woke up wanting to be the best version of me. Shower, makeup, dressed up and my best foot forward, as long as I had you, I got this. You stopped noticing, it wasn’t even gradual. I was no longer something to be proud of, what I did no longer mattered, I amounted to nothing in your eyes. On top of the clear disdain you showed towards me, I’d listen to you talk about your bonuses, your raises, promotions and my favorite, The award of appreciation. It became more and more difficult to be happy for you and that hurt me. I was your biggest cheerleader, I was proud of you, thankful for you, blessed to have you, I appreciated everything you did for us, I loved you. You’d tell me you had a slow day at work and got to relax and stream tv shows, “that’s great babe, you’ve been working so hard and deserve a slow day.” You’d find me asleep on the couch and your resent for me would grow, I was never deserving of a break. 

I thanked you whenever you did something around the house, you interpreted it as me being motherly. I was thankful for you showing up, for being the team member I needed, the little things mattered because you made my life easier if even for a moment. I appreciated you. Everything I did was expected of me, we were bo longer a team, I was the help who wasn’t worth the pay and you resented me, even though I didn’t change, your perspective of me did. 

It became exhausting, mentally, physically and especially emotionally. I gave you the best version of me and you didn’t notice, the less you noticed the less I tried. This is where depression came in, I battled with myself over who I was. I knew who I was but couldn’t come to terms with who I had become, what I had been reduced to in your eyes, a mom. It was supposed to be the most beautiful part of our love story but the role I played in it was viewed as a stain. I was JUST a mom in your eyes. You did not value me, you did not appreciate me, you did not cherish me. A job that replaced me four days after I left, made me feel more appreciated than the man I gave up everything for. 

You cried when I walked down the aisle, you were proud to have me, you cried when I birthed our children, you were proud of your family. Then you discarded me like one of your collectibles but worse, I wasn’t even put on the shelf with your most prized, most valuable ones. I was discarded with the other ones that were cool to have but opened, used and deemed worthless. You forgot that you opened me, I was your most valuable and favorite possession, you played with me, you showed me off, we had fun and made some of the best memories together and overtime I lost value in your eyes. 

You asked me what I wanted. I wanted a thank you. I saw you thank the lady for your morning coffee, I saw you thank the gas station clerk for providing your service, I saw you thank the stranger who left space so you could merge but I never experienced you thanking me. “Thank you for marrying me, giving up your last name and identity to be my wife, thank you for believing in me, encouraging me, thank you for comforting me on my most difficult days and being there with me to celebrate the greatest, thank you for giving up your job and more of your identity to be a mother to our children, thank you for altering your body and self image to birth our children, thank you for the things you do on a daily basis that make our lives easier, thank you for being my MVP and showing up when I need you,” a simple yet meaningful thank you. It’s too late to thank me now but I’ve forgiven you for your unspoken apology, I know you’re sorry.

Vagnen är en specialanpassad spårvagn som rullar runt de mest centrala delarna av Göteborg, samtidigt som den erbjuder ett noggrant utvalt sortiment av säsongsbetonade alkoholhaltiga drycker, lättare tilltugg och stämningsfull musik. Perfekt för en lugn kväll med vänner eller för att fira något speciellt, utan stress över dagen efter.

 **Detaljer om konceptet:**

**1. Rutt:**

Vagnen rör sig längs en noggrant utvald rutt som täcker centrala Göteborgs vackraste och mest ikoniska områden. Den kan till exempel passera:

* **Centralstationen** – enkel på- och avstigning.

* **Linné** – mysig stadsdel med vacker arkitektur.
* **Järntorget & Haga** – klassiska göteborgska miljöer.

**2. Dryck & Mat:**

* **Säsongsbetonade drycker:**
   * Höst: Mustiga röda viner, äppelglögg med alkohol, eller kryddiga cocktails.
   * Vinter: Varm glögg, Irish Coffee och porteröl.
   * Vår: Friska viner, mousserande drycker och lätta säsongs inspirerade drinkar.
   * Sommar: Fruktiga cocktails, svalkande öl och somriga sangrias.
* **Lättare tilltugg:**
   * Lokalt producerade ostar med kex och marmelad.
   * Smörrebröd med säsongens pålägg.
   * Sötsaker som chokladtryfflar eller små bakverk.
   * Chips med mera

**3. Musik & Atmosfär:**

* Stämningsfull bakgrundsmusik som varierar med säsongen. Exempelvis jazz och akustiska toner på hösten, julmusik under vintern och livligare melodier på våren och sommaren.
* Möjlighet för liveframträdanden vissa kvällar, till exempel en akustisk gitarrist eller en violinist.

**4. Biljettupplägg:**

* **Biljetter bokas i förväg** via en hemsida eller app för att säkerställa platser. Eller först till plats?
* Pris inkluderar en välkomstdrink och tilltugg, med möjlighet att köpa till fler drycker under resan.
* Åldersgräns: **20+**.
* Specialkvällar med teman, exempelvis ""Gin & Tonic Night"" eller ""Vinprovning med utsikt över Göteborg"".

**5. Säkerhet och regler:**

* En erfaren värd/värdinna samt utbildad personal som hanterar serveringen.
* Alkoholserveringen sker enligt gällande regler och upphör 30 minuter innan turens slut.
* Maxantal passagerare är anpassat för en bekväm och trygg upplevelse.",2,1732089425.0,Gothenburg,1,1.0,False

So I’m two weeks in on a Silvia Pro X, and I’m constantly getting sour shots, or I excessively thick consistencies with very slow extractions. We’re talking 15 seconds to get the first gram of output.

I’m aiming for a 2.5 output ratio, 17.9g espresso delivering 44 grams of coffee, in about 35-40 seconds. I’m using medium roasted beans, and have tried a 4 second pre-infusion. However, to rid of as much sourness I can, I need to grind so fine that it comes out all clumpy, spending quite some time on WST, and extractions take more tha 50 seconds. And I’m still getting a bit of sourness 

This is my second espresso machine, same grinder.

Grinder: Eureka Manuale
I use a wst to rid of clumps, and see generally good extractions with the bottomless 18g standard filter. 

I’ve noticed that the bar pressure is consistently at 9.25-9.5 during extractions. Could this be the cause of the problem? Too much pressure causing under extraction and therefore the sourness, against which I’m forced to grind finer what otherwise would be considered normal?

OK, sleep isn't so bad at all.

This morning, 6:30am, start and logon, quick glimpse into the marketplace (not active yet) and download-manager. Is there really no option to download the word packages offline? I haven't found one yet.

I hop into the seat, starting a flight in Stuttgart and watch the rotating loading circle, and watch, and watch, after just some 15 minutes EDDS was ready and I departed. Everything seems fine, not so bad. Stuttgart looks well, the towers are here, a short check of the VORs and ILS frequencys, poitive? Really?

Flying over Stuttgart looks good. I wanted to adjust some button alignments, esc-options-(wow is this unintuitive)-back-black screen witch the outside-view instruments-esc-back-same-back and forth...

1gvkghj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gvkghj,aio for being very very upset about this? (context in body),"i cant include this entire argument because its been going on for like 48+ hours so ill give the run down. ive been having conflict with my dad and step mom (alex) for a long time. we were in family therapy for a while but the family therapist said we needed time to “work on things” and refused to work with us. my dad gets very upset over small things. he cancelled a whole trip because i (politely) said that it bothers me when he pressures me to drink coffee in the morning. he also once grabbed my waisst and refused to let go, saying he thought i was “going to hurt myself” if i went into my room when i had given no indication of. he also tried to break down the door of the bathroom i was in because i “wasnt supposed to leave his sight”. hes called me all sorts of names (asshole, delusional, jerk, etc.) and constantly tries to convince me that im crazy and dont know how to talk. he also kicked me out of the house two years ago for being “crazy” (i was struggling with my ED at the time). he has a history of abuse (he abused my mom so bad they got a restraining order and a divorce). he wouldnt make meals for me and my sibling when we were like 4 and 6 and not tall enough to reach the counters. he would drunkedly scream at us when we were in elementary school (luckily hes sober now after my step mom threatened to divorce him). recently, my dad was texting and driving. admittedly, we were going quite slow, but still moving and it was making me very uncomfortable and i asked him to stop. it spawned a huge argument that eventually resulted in him kicking me out of the house. he let me back in recently and we kinda just didnt talk about it. anyway, fast forward to sunday. my little sister (8) has an issue with chewing with her mouth open, which is totally understandable for a kid her age, but noise really bothers me as i have autism and sensory issues. i noticed she tends to do it more when she uses her ipad while eating, so i said maybe it would help her remember to keep her mouth closed if she put it down while eating. my dad got super pissed at this (still unsure why) and started yelling at me for a bunch of random bad habits of mine (leaving my shoes in the bathroom, forgetting to throw my cans away, etc. all of which im working on). i got overwhelmed with him yelling at me and screamed something like shut up and left to go cry in my room (classic 17 year old things, i did later apologize for this). my dad texted me saying i was misunderstanding him bringing up all my bad habits, but i said he has a habit of when he (or his parenting) gets feedback he tries to turn it on the other person. anyway then we argued and argued and argued. my therapist has told me many times she thinks it would be best if i moved out of his house and into my moms, but ive been staying with my dad hoping that spending quality time together will help us heal. but recently theyve been hurting me so bad and stressing me out so much that i am beginning to wonder if i should go no contact when i grow up. when they started to escalate the situation, i told them this in a desperate attempt to show them how much theyre hurting me. its hard to follow the rest of the convo as it was a lot of back and forth and repeating ourselves but whatever. i said some shit i dont mean, i must admit. i said “shut up” and “fuck off” a couple times because the constant arguing was giving me panic attacks and they wouldnt stop texting me even when i begged to take a break so i could calm down (also they refused when i was in class and getting told off for being on my phone). my messages were not the most mature, i must admit, but it really really hurts me when they treat me like im incapable of communicating at all and that i know nothing about how people work. i apologized later for the immature texts. as mentioned i have autism, and my dad uses it against me to say i dont understand how any of society or human behavior works. it really really hurt me when my step mom said she didnt want to have a relationship with me because she is my step mom and has no responsibility to. shes been really close to me and has always been just a “third parent”, not on a lower level than my mom and dad. so hearing her brush that off like this just made me break down. 

also context to the gaslighting slide, he said that “you are delusional” (which he has said multiple times) is just a figure of speech, he wasnt actually calling me delusional, and hence its not gaslighting",0,1732089049.0,AmIOverreacting,1,0.33,False

1gvkf3u,https://www.reddit.com/r/workout/comments/1gvkf3u/workout_advice/,Workout Advice,"So, I'm needing some advice about a couple of topics centering around my workouts. For starters, here's a little bit about me. Please let me know if I need to post elsewhere, I'm new to asking advice for working out.

I'm 23 years old. Was involved in many sports as a kid growing up, and have been working out ""sporadically"" in the past 2-3 years. I weigh 210 lbs, used to weigh 260 lbs in 2023, and used to weigh 178 lbs in 2019. I've naturally been ""strong"", and have had a low metabolism all my life. I used to have a strict diet, eating around 1500 calories a day and eating a mixture of chicken w/vegetables, or red meat w/vegetables. Now, my diet consists of what I can get my hands on but not over 2500 calories; sandwiches, coffee, granola bars, etc. I'm 5 foot 8 inches tall.

Now, I'm currently struggling with figuring out what type of workout I need for what I want and why my body is reacting the way it is. I'm wanting to center around increasing my stamina and endurance so that I can excel when I re-join the military as well as when I get into mixed martial arts. I've always had terrible stamina, but if I can get 2 minutes of rest then I can keep going all day.

I did take almost a full month break from working out due to starting a second job and trying to adjust.

Here's my current workout routine; (7 Minute Run - avg .83 miles) (20 Push-Ups) (15 Sit-Ups) (20 Squats) (8 8-Count Push-Ups) 2-4 Minute Rest (15 Assisted Pull-Ups) (15 Incline Push-Ups) (15 Decline Push-Ups) (35 Knee-Highs)  
This pretty much kills me. I did this twice and both times I was extremely nauseous and lightheaded afterwards.

Here's my previous workout routine. This would be the most frequent workouts that I would do, every now and then I would complete different exercises, but this wouldn't wear me out nearly as much as my current workouts. If needed, I can post the picture of the actual program; (2x7 Minute Run - avg 1.70 miles) (5x8 Bench-Press / Max weight for reps) 5x8 Squat / Max weight for reps) (5x8 3-Count Curls / Almost max weight for reps) (4x10 Alternate Knee Tucks) (5x10 Crunches)

Before the previous workout routine, I was doing something else but I didn't start recording my workouts until that one. I did the previous one for about 6-8 months, increasing my run distance and the amount of weight I was able to lift over time.

If I can find advice here, I'd really appreciate it. I don't know if the time I spent during my break killed my stamina that badly, or if I'm underestimating how difficult the workout is at my level.

1gvkamq,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1gvkamq/i_knew_my_wife_was_a_slut_and_i_married_her_no/,I knew my wife was a slut. And i Married her. No Regrets,"I (39M) married the mother of my 2 boys “Sara"" (26F). We have 2 boys, steady work, 2 cars, we own a condo in a great neighborhood. And we’ve had zero conflicts thus far. 

  
We met when she was a medical assistant at a surgical center that i was managing. She was the small cute quiet girl who really didn’t say much. In fact I never paid much attention to her. I took my staff out for drinks my first holiday season working there. Everyone got pretty drunk accept for Sara, at the end of the night I made sure everyone had a safe/reliable way to get home (Ubers, Lyfts, Sober Significant others). Sara said she’d take the bus. I told her “nonsense"" i’d drive her home. We got into my car, i start pulling out of the parking lot and joking say to her “do you want to comeback to my place for some coffee?” and she says “I don’t really drink coffee, especially not this late but we can go back to your place!” There was a 5 sec pause because i wasn’t expecting that response. Needless to say we went to my place and had sex that night (unprotected). I will admit it was really good but i chalked it up as a one night stand and didn’t intended to go back until i saw her at work the next day when I finally noticed how attractive she was. We started hooking up on the regular after that.

After about a month i asked her if she was dealing with anyone else. She told me that she was hooking up with one of the Physician Assistants at the job but cut things off after the 2nd night with me. I asked her why, she stated “I don’t know...it felt like the right thing to do because things with you felt right even if we’re just fucking. Plus you’re so nice to everyone and He’s…eh...” Oddly enough I understood what she meant. The PA was a bit of dick. Arrogant and walked around like he was the actual Surgeon. I think she misunderstood my next question of “well is there anyone else?” because  she proceeded to tell me a full synopsis of her young sexual history. And i couldn’t believe how active this unassuming little girl had been. I had to ask her if she had ever been assaulted or molested, she denied it. and Stated she just felt it was “easier to put out then to have to worry about what happens when you don’t”.

  
Sara had lost her virginity when she was 18 to guy who was 23. She then hooked up with two guys in her neighborhood the summer before going away to college. There, she began a 2 year relationship with a guy from the football team and had a FFM threesome with him and her “BFF” at the time as well as TWO MMF threesomes! One with him and his cousin and the other with him and one of his teammates. They only broke up after she found out he was sleeping with her “BFF”. She then started an actual relationship with the cousin from the threesome. That lasted almost a full year before he dumped her, basically stating that his relationship with her was causing problems in his family (NO Shit). I asked her if that was it, but she added that she had a “couple of one night stands after the club.” I thought a couple meant two. She meant EIGHT!!! And these weren’t drunk bad decision nights out. She was fully sober and aware.  “I’d be dancing with the guy most of the night, he’d ask me if i wanted to go back to his place and i’d say yes. I wasn’t drunk so i wasn’t worried something would happen to me against my will.” That was her explanation. 

I asked her why she felt so comfortable telling me all of this? “I think you’re a good guy. I don’t think you're gonna go to work and tell everyone. And if you did then it’s my fault for telling you my business. Sorry if this turned you off but i just feel comfortable with you.” 

I never forgot that conversation that night. And i never asked or brought up her pass ever again. (until now). She doesn’t know it because she’s never asked but I haven’t been with another since the night of that convo. 

Eventually our reckless 8 month unprotected sex fling lead to her getting pregnant, might have been on purpose lol. A year and a half later our 2nd son was born and eventually we had small wedding ceremony because neither of us wanted her to be a ""baby mama”. She’s my wife and mother of my children…(and a slut lol jkjk)

Since I’m going through a lot there are gonna be multiple things in this, so the things is I am 23 (M), lives in Islamabad, and I’ve almost been making 100 to 200k a month for the last 3 years. I started trying back in my college and I was making some money in start when I was in start of university and after 3rd semester I didn’t take any university fee from home (per semester university fee was around 100k + Traveling + stationery + miscellaneous university expenses etc), since my father wasn’t supporting me financially, my elder sister paid my university fee for first 3 semesters, I didn’t want to be a burden, so I started the struggling did tuitions and ahista ahista grow hona shuru hui, I used to go university and shaam main on bicycle I used to go for home tuitions, and then I targeted online clients bought laptop had a graphic tablet and stuff, I started making some money to support myself and from third semester I was managing most of my university expenses myself. 4th semester onwards I was doing multiple online hustles and mostly teaching maths online. And I managed my university fee for fourth semester ( it was tough for me being an average 18 y/o), I really didn’t want to take fee money from elder sister even though she had been always very supportive but you know I wanted to do something. So after that I never taken university fee from home managed some scholarship and my own money for maximum university expenses. Now I was 20-21 y/o and I was making around 90-100k per month alhumdulilah. I tried manage some home expenses fuel daily groceries etc, since I’m the only son and when Ammi used to tell me kay yeh yeh lana hai bahir ja rahay ho to I obviously don’t ask for money when I know I have my own earned money in my pocket. I usually tried to spent everything at home, I used to spend on food and activities with friends as well. Like jab dost khana khatay thay beshak jitnay bhi ho meray pass paisay hotay thay main sab ka pay kar deta tha bill, that’s how I am from start, like kisi ko zaroorat ho koi tension ho I tried for almost everyone one I had around, not saying all this to gain some respect or something just explaining how I am. So the thing is ghar main bhi parallel main financial issues chal rahay, I am trying for my home as well, I don’t know if I should be saying this but my father (that’s the main topic) never really did much for us or for Ammi, jab say main nay unko dekha hai he never managed to run any business properly, pata nahi kitnay saray business try kiye koi sahi say nahi kiya, bas ajeeb sa mindset hai to give you an example koi cheez 2000 ki lain gay to 2100 ya bari mushkil say 2200 tak baichain gay, jahan shaid aram say ziyada profit kamaya ja sakta hai, zehniyat bohat choti hai, himat nahi hai sahi say business karnay wali, like unko lagta hai unhain karoobar karna aata hai but he always wasted money, his own inheritance money, then my mothers jewellery money, then from his elder brother then more jewellery of our Ammi, then money from his friend and then more jewellery of Ammi, so on it’s been almost 18 years that I’m observing all this…. 

It’s going on for many more years. Now he’s almost 60 and still have the will that someone gives him money so that he can start something again, all he wants I feel like is to have a place to sit and run orders, a shop or something, to what I’ve observed over years is that agar aap unko 20 lakh dain kisi karobar kay liye wo usko lagain gay sahi say kaam karna ata hai nahi, ajeeb dimaagh say karobar karain gay break even price par ya thoray thoray nuksaan main baichain gay and 2 saal main aisay 20lakh barbaad kar dain gay. Is sab kay parallel main his toxicity at home and badtameezi jab unka mood kharab ho ga bacho say Ammi say yeh sab bhi chalay ga even though paisay Ammi nay hi diye ho karobaar kay liye apna zewar bech kar ya apnay ghar walo say maang kar. I’ve seen when he gets money invest in something and starts controlling that business he feels like may bari koi cheez hu, unka dimaagh shaid rationally nahi sochta kay loss kesay calculate ho ga profit kesay banay ga market kesay karna bas ajeeb sa dimagh hai honestly after all these years mujhay khud nahi samjh aati. He wasted everything, ab Ammi Kay pass shaid mushkil hi koi jewellery reh gai ho, shaadi par aur uskay baad bhi Ammi ko unkay ghar walo nay kaafi saari jewellery di thi. Almost sab aisay barbaad hui hai over the years. I don’t know what to say more to give the exact picture of my father. He never thought or did anything seriously for us. It was 2022 Ab since koi bari investment to ki nahi ja sakti, almost sab barbaad kar diya. I was in the end of university he knew I was making money, he started trying to convince me to start business he used to explain me yeh aisay maal aata hai wesay jaata hai us jaga bara kaam hai is jaga yeh hai wo hai, humay bas itni koi 2-4 lakh ki investment say yeh mil jay ga yeh ho sakta hai wo ho jayga, and just because he is my father I never said anything negative, kay saari zindagi aap say kuch hua nahi to ab bas kuch karnay ki zaroorat nahi hai aur pasiay nahi hain barbaad karnay kay liye. Even though I used to get worried after these conversations kay I’m contributing almost everything I make every month, ghar ka kharcha nahi poori ho raha almost 1/4 monthly expenses was somehow managed by naniyal, then my elder sister struggling doing job I was in my last semester in end 2021 (20 yo) since then I am paying all utility bills gas internet electricity water whatnot, aur itnay kisam kay kharchay ghar kay, is sab main kahan say du unko paisay karobaar kay liye. He isn’t contributing anything in home like kuch bhi nahi almost, like his contribution wasn’t even 5 percent in home expenses ulta jab sab khatam ho giya tha to my elder sister used to give him some money for some basic expenses of his own. Khuda khoofi main even though my father always degraded insulted and abused her. But uska phir bhi dil thora aisa hai, that’s how we all siblings are. Khair ammi kay itni martaba lakho denay kay baad kabh abu say karobaar nahi chal saka that but phir bhi main nay aik martaba unkay aik idea kay liye kuch paisay diye wo paisay jo ghar kay kharchay kay liye rakhay thay, he ran that thing for a month wasted everything, after sometime he started talking with me some other idea I gave him money from money I kept for home expenses and personal expenses, and same thing happened no nothing just wasted everything and then the repeat cycle,

now this time (around July ) he was talking about something I just didn’t showed much interest he rented a shop somewhere and then obviously he didn’t have money for buying items and clothes for filling up shop his mood was off and some days passed I didn’t talk about it, he told me he rented this place out, usko thora unho nay set waghera kiya, lekin paisay nahi thay to he was just staying home and not going there, kay aas pass walay log boltay thay maal dalain, a week passed and he called me in lounge and said “kiya baat hai mujhay pasand nahi aai yeh baat kay dukaan li hai” a night before that my Ammi told me kay Abu said her kay “ mijaal hai is (yani main nay) nay koi baat ki ho ya poocha ho kiya karna hai dukaan ka” aur aisi baatain. I told him kay Ammi told me kay mijaal hai kuch poocha ho main nay, I told him kiya poochu main ghar kay kharchay pooray nahi hotay choti behan ki fee 150k per semester hai wo bhi main deta hu instalments main karwa kar Deni parh rahi hai, etc etc. In a normal tone with respect and all, I even said kay main nay to kabhi nahi bola kay mijaal hai aap nay kabhi poocha ho kay baita saray expenses kesay pooray hotay hain I was doing a 9-5 job after passing out and used to take classes till midnight after coming from job and again sometimes there used to be to be classes at 3 or 4 AM in morning and then again office next day, that’s how I was doing everything, I said main nay to kabhi nahi kaha kay mijaal hai aap nay aaj tak poocha ho mera meray say, he went silent and didn’t say anything, I didn’t say anything loud or worse, bas mera dil bohat dukha hua tha, bas ho gai thi meri. That conversation ended and after a few days he went somewhere out of station and bought some stuff for shop and I didn’t ask him or said anything where it came from, and now after a few months the shop is closed he don’t have money to pay rent almost the place was dead i told him already and he knew it so no sales, he took everything home and now I also came to know by Ammi kay she asked one of her brother for money. Aur mujhay itna dukh hua and I was really upset with Ammi, she said I did this taakay ghar main sakoon ho bilawaja aap aur hum pareshan na ho.

Pata nahi yaar there is a lot going on for years, mujhay ab Abu ki shakal dekh kar ghussa aata hai, unki batameezi, bayhisi, koi ehsaas na hona zimaydaari ka and everything. Unko abhi bhi shaid andar say ghussa is baat ka hai kay agar ghar main bari behan ki shaadi hai to ghar kiyu renovate kar rahay hain nay Şofay kiyu la rahay hain lamps nay kiyu lag rahay hain, paint kiyu ho raha waghera waghera which is important, out of family shaadi hoti hai nay log aatay hain Rishtay işi Tarhan bantay hain, realistically aisay hi hota hai har banda dekhta hai aglay ka ghar uthna baithna etc etc, lekin Abu ko andar say ghussa charha hua hai I know kay yeh sab kiyu ho raha hai mujhay paisay kiyu nahi day rahay kay main aur barbaad karu karobar kay naam par, Unko ab nazar bhi aa raha hai kay main unkay samnay nahi aata wo ay dining table par to main chala jata hu uth kar salam nahi karta kabhi kabhi, even though I try to keep myself in control and all but nahi hota ab. I am going through a lot. I have been making almost 100 to 200k every month for the last 3 years and sometimes even above 200k, but I never was able to save anything for myself main nay hamesha socha kay meri bheno ko Ammi ko ghar ko kisi cheez ki zaroorat hai to wo poori ho jay, apnay liye shopping bhi nahi ki koi sahi say itna arsa ho giya. I am at the point right now kay I like a girl and I really wanna marry her, and it started as two way, I don’t wanna stay in this haram relationship thing honestly and she wanted to get married as well since she’s almost 25 and her parents are looking for and considering proposals, she kept telling me and I explained her most of the things, it’s been almost a year we know each other and almost 4 months that we confessed to each other, now I’m not in the situation to afford shaadi expenses, not just shaadi I have just managed a room for myself in home which was earlier used  as store cupboards and stuff, now the room is finally empty and I just have a single mattress for myself here and my work table. In order to get married I have to get some bed, dressing, maybe a TV and 2 coffee chairs for us, there is no attach washroom so the washroom that is right outside this room I have to renovate that completely because it’s not functional for years and was used as laundry, I explained many things to her and we agreed we are gonna get engaged in a couple of months and then within a year or 2 max we will be married, both of us were happy maybe at that time she didn’t think rationally and now I feel like after talking to her elder sister about me and my situation her sisters aren’t willing and have concerns, that kinda make sense as well if I see it from their lense, her sisters are married have their experiences and probably apni behan kay liye kuch ziyada acha chahtin ho gi, I don’t blame anyone just the things is I can’t explain much but some reason the other the girl I love and wante to marry don’t wanna see my face ever again because she probably think I don’t want to get married and just keep her in this relationship and wants her to wait, usay lagta hai shaid jab bhi shaadi ki baat hoti hai to mujhay ghussa aa jata hai, just the thing is shaadi ki baat hoti hi is Tarhan kay aksar wo apnay concerns ya ghar kay pressure ya zindagi main kiya hoga agay shaadi hogi bhi hamari ya nahi is ki pareshani main yeh bhool jaati hai kay main kesay mehnat kar raha hu, aur meri zindagi main kiya mushkilaat hain, wo mujhay aisay bolti ya feel karwati hai jesay said mera koi masla hai hi nahi, shaid main usko kabhi explain nahi kar saka shaid sab kuch sahi say, shaid she is leaving me because she isn’t feeling secure, peaceful, and loving life with me, she’s seeing a lot of problems in staying with me, I don’t know I just don’t wanna lose her, I even asked her kay may abhi baat karleta hu ghar shaadi ki (even though noones gonna be happy witth it at my home i guess and mybe you can imagine the reason by now or you will know ahead) but I don’t know what and when went wrong but I feel like it’s just over, there was a lot more in this. I won’t blame her main abhi bhi piyaar karta hu, wo bohat achi hai just shaid I was never able to explain her well, aur shaid mujh say hamesha kuch ghalati ho jaati thi aur mujhy dukh hota hai kay usay yeh lagta hai shaid main kabhi shaadi nahi karna chahta. I’ve been crying to Allah kay he knows what I wanted and I didn’t have enough money to get everything fixed, shaid now I feel like piyaar karna meri ghalti thi, I should have realised I don’t deserve love, I wasnt able to afford it. i dont know if i see it the way kay just if pick up last 3 years i roughly made 50 to 60 lakhs in total, aur agar ghar kay kharchay aur zarooriyat poori karna meri zimaydari na ban gai hoti just apni khushi say thora bohat ghar main bhi kiya hota kharch apni behno par ammi par khud par thora jaisay banda khushi say kharch karta hai kiya bhi hota har month to abhi bhi shaid almost 15 say 20 lakh meray saving main hotay, jis say main khud apnay paiso say valimay ka event kar sakta tha, abhi hi room set kar sakta tha washroom renovate kar sakta tha uskay aur apnay liye koi choti choti cheezain aur kar sakta tha jis say hum dono sakoon ki zindagi guzaar sakain, i planned never to get married before she came to my life, main nay socha tha bas saari zindagi ghar kay maslay theek karu ga i will not start my own family, meri shaadi say aisa na ho main ghar ki zimaydaari na poori kar saku, but i really want her with me. yeh sab bhi main dekhta hu to feel like abu is the responsilbe person that i am loosing the person i really love. i dont want anyone to blame the girl there must be things and reasons for her as well. for now i am more concerned, kay yaar yeh ghar kay rent ki, bills ki, groceries ki, choti behan ki university fee uskay kharcho ki zarooriyat ki, ham sab bacho aur ammi ki zarooriyat ki zimaydaari kis ki hai, kiya yeh sab karna meri zimaydaari hai? kiya yeh sab mera karna hi banta tha, ab currently is sab main hotay huay main nay kabhi yeh nahi socha kay yaar why should i pay for these things, i am not responsible for this. main kiyu choti behan ki fee du, main kiyu gas paani bijli ka bill du main kiyu market say grocery ki cheezon kay liye paisay du, main karta hu aur karu ga bhi, balkay i'll try to improve every day and make more money for my family for ammi for every loved one around. Allah tala nay mujhay mard banaya hai, He made me the provider. but right now i have some limitations as well, i dont have minimum monthly income of 5 or 6 lakhs so that i can keep everyone happy and get married. I am 23, being an average person main itna hi kar sakta tha ab tak. if i look other people fathers around they are doing everything for family, even paying expenses for shaadi of their son and every single thing. 

bas mujhay samjh nahi aa raha kay yaar kiya yeh expenses jo main pay kar raha hu kiya yeh wakai sirif meri zimaydaari hai, main abu ko dekhta hu to aisa lagta hai jesay yeh sab wakai meri zimaydari hai, unka mindset aisa hai kay wo shaid bolain kay main nay thori kaha hai university jao ghar set karo churwa do university choti behan ko, na karo koi kharcha, yeh wo aisi illogical baatain, sometimes i feel like his brain doesnt work at all, he doesnt really give a shit, never really paid for any of my sisters university, hum sab nay khud hi kisi tarhan fees pay kar kay parha ya ammi nay kabhi apni koi gold ki cheez baichi bari behno ki fee kay liye jab aur koi rasta nahi tha. 

abu nay shaid apnay aap ko samjhaya hua hai kay unki koi zimaydaari nahi hai, i dont know. there is alot more going on and i dont know how to handle everything, how to stay focused, find more work to keep making money, har wakt dimaagh main sawal chaltay rehaty hain, especially becasue i am loosing the girl i want to marry, samjh nahi aata abu ka kiya karu baat karu sahi say na karu Allah na naraz ho jay, Abu ko dekh dekh kar ghussa bhi aata hai, i dont know, kiya yeh sab kharchay manage karna meri zimaydaari banti thi sirif, banti thi to kitnay percent banti hai, kabhi kabhi thought aata hai kay yaar actually to meri zimaydaari yeh honi cahhiye kay meri shaadi ho to main apni biwi ki har zaroorat ka uski khushi ka khayal rakhu. all this doenst mean i am planning not to pay for anything for my sisters and ammi, main piyaar karta hu un say, main hamesha koshish karu ga kay agar meri aur unki zaroorat main faisla karna ho to apni zaroorat ignore kar du. 

Also, now this is the age i really want a partner i knew i will have the emotional support and there is gonna be a partner with me jisay main har baat kar saku ga, jo meray saath hogi, since i am gonna marry her, also i just wanna keep evrything clean stay away from sins or anything, ya phir koi aisa relation, main Allah ko naraz nahi karsakta. but shaadi bhi nahi ho sakti itnay araam say. ammi ko agar koi bolta hai mazak main kay ab iska number hai is kay liye sochain to ammi kehti hain g dua karay Allah isay achi rozi day, and it really breaks my heart. like you cant imagine, it gives the other person an impression, as if i am not doing much or anything, i dont do 9 to 5 job anymore, work for myself, online and tutoring thing, that job was never enough there was no point to waste my potential there. so since i work for myself and i am home this also gives people impression kay han Allah karay shaid isay achi job mil jay etc etc, even though i am making more money than their sons.

my nani today came and while she was going she hugged me and said Allah achi si job day day phir shaadi bhi ho jay achi si. and my khala's son is getting married and everyone in naniyal is happy for him and he works in a known organization, i have the idea his salary would be max 100k hosakta hai thori kam ho ho sakta hai around ho. and he did nothing for his family like I did, because his father does everything. I didnt say anything to nani but it broke my heart when nani said that, ammi said once the same thing kay dua karain Allah achi rozi day unkay samnay, so unko bhi aik impression cahal giya ho ga, unko to nahi pata na kaisay finances chaltay hain. i dont know man achi rozi kiya hai, what do i do, how do i keep everyone happy!!!!!

It suddenly now only works for about six seconds and stops. I've also noticed the temperature is luke-warm. If I press either button again to keep topping it up, often it even struggles to push any more through the capsule. If I remove the capsule, the water comes through fine but again only for six seconds and importantly the water is still luke warm. So far. I have:

\- Checked no air lock, did all the usual advice to remove this. But clearly there isnt one as it freely flows without a capsule.

\- Factory reset

\-  Tried to reprogramme Lungo length...still always stops after six seconds so cannot even do that.

\- Descale, did this several times. Although the descale wouldnt do full load on its own, like doing a coffee, it kept cutting out so had to keep hitting the button to do it.

\- Have cleaned all around the insides of the capsule area, pipe cleaner up the nozzle etc.

Any ideas what to do? Thanks

Earlier this year I got out of a long term relationship. A couple months ago I met this new guy who’s been so good and kind to me! He has a son (5 years old) so when the kid was with his mom we spend all our time together which I really enjoyed. When we weren’t hanging out we would text all day plus call each other several times a day. A week ago he started to mention that he wanted me to meet his son soon.

I’m almost 31 and he just turned 33.

Then this weekend his energy towards me COMPLETELY changed. We didn’t see each other at all and barely spoke the entire weekend. I told him Sunday that it felt a little off and asked if everything was okay? He said something like “yeah sorry, I just have so much going on right now”. Then I didn’t hear from him again until Monday morning where I was like “okay what exactly is going on?” And then he was like “I don’t know how to say this but I just have so much going on right now and I need to be for myself. It’s not because I don’t wanna be with you but right now I just can’t”.

I just don’t understand how he talked about me meeting his son like a week ago and then suddenly just change out of nowhere.

I obviously got super sad and we haven’t talked since. Then last night I posted a picture of a cup of coffee on my Instagram story lol and then shortly after he unfollowed me + at least 30 other profiles.

I think I was hoping he just needed some time to figure some things out and then eventually reach out to me again. But seeing that he unfollowed me + so many other accounts seems like he’s completely done with me. And I also found it strange that he unfollowed SO many other accounts and not only mine.

I don’t know if he’s telling the truth, if he just lost interest in me or if he met someone else.

I don’t know what I want from this post haha but I just needed to share my thoughts with someone. Pls be kind 💕 ",1,1732086413.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

Guys. Stop reading now if you are squeamish or feeling triggered today. This one is a doozy. Not good news by any stretch.

So, dang it all... Sat down to end my day with my usual nightly waffle cone with the most delish Turkey Hill Colombian Coffee ice cream (IYKYK). Took that first big ole soft chomp and immediately my brain short circuited (pretty sure almost crapped up my pants 🤔🤷🏻‍♀️). Right away I knew they changed the recipe of the GOAT. Everything was different down to the fine details of info on the carton. Texture, taste, mouth feel... All were not the same. Sure enough I looked at the carton I had just finished off and threw in the bin. Ingredients were different. Really didn't even need to compare because I already knew it was changed. Deep down I just hoped it was a bad batch. Instead it ended up being the beginning of a bad dream.

Fricken kills me to say this, but I'm going to have to switch if they are going to ditch the original recipe for good. Did not dig it at all. Man. It's tough going from madly in love to not even knowing who they are anymore all in a split second. 

Turkey Hill... Please please please please, for the love of God, please go back to the old recipe! It's not too late. I get it. Cream is hella expensive. I personally wouldn't mind one bit if you raised the price as long as you upped the cream back to where it was. Can't deal with this level of heart break right before the holidays. Lol. This might be the thing that finally breaks me 😭😭😭

PS. I WILL write a letter to the President of the United States if I have to.

If you pack lunch for work, school, or day trips, pairing your lunch bag with a good insulated water bottle is a smart move. These bottles help keep drinks hot or cold for hours, ensuring your beverage is always at the right temperature. 

# Why Insulated Water Bottles Matter

Insulated water bottles work by having a double-wall vacuum design. This means there is a gap between the inner and outer layers. It prevents heat transfer, keeping drinks cold or hot longer. Whether you want iced water in summer or warm tea in winter, an insulated bottle can deliver.

**Top Features to Look For**

* **Material Quality**: Most insulated bottles are made of stainless steel, which is durable, rust-resistant, and non-reactive. High-grade stainless steel, like 18/8, is a top choice.
* **Leak-Proof Lids**: A good bottle should have a secure lid to prevent spills. Some have additional locks or seals for extra protection.
* **Size and Capacity**: Choose a bottle that fits easily in your lunch bag but holds enough liquid for your needs. Common sizes range from 12 to 32 ounces.
* **Easy Cleaning**: Bottles with wide openings are easier to clean and can also accommodate ice cubes.

# Popular Choices

1. [Hydro Flask](https://brands.amazrock.com/product/hydro-flask-double-wall-vacuum-insulated-stainless-steel-water-bottle-travel-coffee-mug-wide-mouth-with-bpa-free-hydro/): Known for keeping drinks cold for 24 hours or hot for 12. It offers various sizes and colors.
2. **Yeti Rambler**: Durable and great for extreme temperatures. It has a sturdy lid and keeps your drink temperature steady.
3. **Thermos Stainless King**: This classic option excels at heat retention. It has a cup lid, ideal for soups or hot coffee.

# Tips for Maximizing Performance

* Preheat or pre-chill your bottle by rinsing it with hot or cold water before filling it.
* Avoid putting your insulated bottle in the dishwasher unless the manufacturer says it's safe.
* Do not use your bottle for carbonated drinks unless it’s specifically designed for it.



Pairing an insulated water bottle with your lunch bag can enhance your meal experience. Your drinks will always be just the way you like them. As for the ladies, know this: when combined with stylish and functional [lunch bags for women](https://brands.amazrock.com/product/juliette-darras-insulated-lunch-bags-for-women-elegant-multifunctional-tote-purse/), you can enjoy both convenience and fashion.

1gvjt5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/ghosting/comments/1gvjt5d/ghosts_suck/,Ghosts suck.,"Hello,
Using a throwaway because I'm embarrassed to have to even post about this.

I (34M), met a girl at an acquaintance's birthday celebration. I really thought she was interested. She was looking at me throughout the night, and smiling whenever I made eye contact. She'd make effort to ask me to join her whenever she wanted to step out for a vape break. We'd talk, she seemed engaged, she asked questions, etc.

I ask for her number, because chances were next to zero that I'd see her again and I wanted to talk with her more. She gives it, and I tell her I'll text her so she has mine too. I text: Hello, it's <name>. The <nationality> (this was to make her laugh because I stick out a bit with my accent).
I wanted to make her laugh, and thought it worked because that's what she did.

Party ends, I get home and I text to check in that she got home safe (i see it as common courtesy and as an ice breaker). She responds, I go to sleep.
Next morning, I message and she replies a bit later. We talk, again she seems engaged.

She mentions she struggles getting to sleep at night (asked if she was an early bird or a night owl which was connected to another thing). I suggested there were practices to help with that and chamomile tea helps too.

I then ask if she's open to meeting up for a coffee or a walk in the next week or two (weather dependent) in the same message. Figured i miss every shot I don't take. She reads my message. Nothing, which was contrary to before.

This was Sunday. 3 days ago. She hasn't been online much (whatsapp). I haven't reached out again - I deleted her number and treating it like a ghost. If she weren't interested, why not just say no?

Doesn't stop the anxiety though.

I have Asperger's, so this stuff is already tough. And I just don't get it. It's a major trigger for anxiety for me. I'm working on it, but these opportunities are rare so it's taking awhile. And by major, I mean I struggle to eat (physically - like i gotta force the food down) and my sleep is disturbed. Not to mention, the anxiety doesn't help at all. I'm also a perpetual overthinker, perfectionist and possibly an Anxious Avoidant. All stuff i'm working on. Thought i was nailing it, then this. I've never had a relationship, so I was really hoping this would break the cycle, but nope. I was fine to take it slow to see if she was even right for me.

1) Did I say something to turn her off?
2) Did I ask her out too soon?
3) Did I reach out to her too soon?
4) Is this even ghosting? I mean, i think it is.
5) What do i do?

1gvjh7g,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gvjh7g,AirPods Pro 2: Long-Term Review ,"TLDR in the form of an Apple Intelligence Summary at the end

So I’ve had the AirPods Pro Second Generation since launch and wanted to share my thoughts about them after over 2 years of daily use. I upgraded from the 1st Generation AirPods Pro, which I also had since they launched, and liked them a lot. And before that, I had the original AirPods, which I also loved. So I think it’s safe to say I’m well-credentialed in my knowledge of AirPods and their use in everyday life. I’m going to break down this review into sections: Design, Sound Quality, Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) and Transparency mode, battery life, experience using iOS 18 and the new features it brings to AirPods, noticeable upgrades from my first-gen AirPods Pro, whether it’s worth upgrading to from a previous pair of AirPods, whether you should choose AirPods Pro or the new AirPods 4 with ANC, and Final Thoughts. Feel free to not read all of it or skip around. I’m mainly writing this because it’s interesting to me, and hopefully, some of you in this sub will find it interesting as well.  

1. Design

I really like the design of the AirPods Pro. I find the silicone tips to be quite comfortable, and the standard medium-sized tips have always worked best for my ears. The buds are quite durable, and they have a few knicks and scratches from when I’ve dropped the buds, but they still work perfectly fine. I’ve had to replace the tips a couple of times as they slowly wear and yellow, but that’s not a huge deal since you can get 2 pairs for $8. The case is well designed as well for the most part. I like the speaker on the bottom, that has helped me find them on countless occasions when they slip in between my couch cushions. The case still scratches incredibly easily, which is a bummer but not a huge deal as it’s just cosmetic. I had a case on the AirPods case for most of the time since launch to prevent scratches but removed it recently. I had super glued the top of the case on since it kept falling off, and in order to get it off, I had to pry it off with a knife, which left a lot of scratches and residue. Fortunately, I was able to get rid of most of the residue, but the case doesn’t look good. I have come to believe that AirPods cases are largely a mistake. They just make them more bulky and don’t do that much to protect them. The case does scratch pretty easily considering it’s glossy white, but it’s really just something you have to accept. One annoying design feature is that when you drop the case, the AirPods often go flying out of the case upon impact. This is exactly the opposite of what you’d want to happen if you drop the case. It would be nice if they fixed it in the next version, perhaps by increasing the strength of the magnets. Also, the charging pins in the case are quite sensitive to dust or debris. On multiple occasions, one of the AirPods won’t charge and will be low on battery when I want to use them. It’s not a deal breaker as it’s usually not an issue, but I have to check to make sure they’re charging when I put them in the case, which is not terrible, but it’s less convenient than just putting them in the case when you’re done using them and knowing they’ll be charged when you use them next. So overall, the design is great, and I’m super satisfied with them. A few downsides in terms of cosmetic durability, but otherwise great.

2. Sound Quality and Sound Features

Now, I’m not an audiophile whatsoever, but I will say I appreciate high-quality audio, and I’m not disappointed with the AirPods Pro 2. Music sounds clear, there’s a decent amount of bass, mids, and highs are also clear. Obviously, a pair of over-ear headphones like AirPods Max will have better sound quality and bass due to having much larger drivers, but for the size of the earbud, they’re super impressive. I don’t have much more to say about the audio quality. It’s more than adequate for me, and that’s what matters. Microphone quality is also pretty good. The noise isolation feature is super impressive in loud environments. I FaceTimed a friend from an MLB game, and she said my voice sounded a bit muffled, but she didn’t hear any of the background noise even though it was super loud. Obviously, the mics aren’t anything you’d want to use for professional recordings or in any place where clarity is super important, but for most phone calls and meetings, the microphones on the AirPods are adequate. So the sound and mic quality are great, and for the overwhelming majority of people, it will be more than adequate.

There are some other sound features that are nice to have. Personalized Spatial Audio is a nice feature that not only enables Spatial Audio when watching content, but also requires you to scan your ears with your iPhone for the best listening experience. Conversation awareness is an interesting feature but one that I actually turned off. Basically, it lowers the volume of your audio if it thinks someone is talking to you or if you start talking, and while in theory, this seems great, it rarely works well in practice. When I had it enabled, it often would bring down the volume of my audio when I was merely in public with other people talking near me, or if I was singing along to a song or even coughing. So I ended up turning that feature off.  There’s also features like personalized volume that apparently uses machine learning to adjust the sound based on your environment. Once again, cool in theory, but I’d rather just adjust the volume myself. Lots of cool features for adjusting sound, except for built-in EQ controls. Apple allows you to change the EQ of music in the settings for Apple Music, but that obviously only applies to music in Apple Music. It would be nice if you could change the EQ system-wide, but customization has never been Apple’s top priority. We’re just now gaining the ability to put apps “wherever” we want on the Home Screen. Perhaps I’m asking for too much. 

3. Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) and Transparency Mode

When the first-gen AirPods Pro were announced with Active Noise Cancellation, I immediately bought them. I loved the original AirPods, but since they were just an earbud with no seal, it meant that any background noise was easily heard even when music was playing. I absolutely love ANC and transparency mode. In my experience, the ANC is good at blocking out most consistent noises at lower frequencies. The low hum of my AC unit or fan is almost completely canceled out by the ANC, and even some more unpredictable noises that are at lower volumes are canceled out. There’s a dog across the street from my house who sometimes sits outside and barks constantly for hours. I am able to faintly hear the barking in my bedroom, but when I put in the AirPods Pro and turn on ANC, the barking completely vanishes. I’ve also had pretty good success using the AirPods Pro with ANC on airplanes. I used to fly with my Bose QC35s because they were overear headphones that did a better job canceling the noise of the engine, and they still do a better job than the AirPods Pro, but once again, the AirPods hold their own. The ANC is impressive at blocking out the noise. Ever since getting the Apple Vision Pro, I’ve used the AirPods Pro exclusively when flying since over-ear headphones don’t really work with the Vision Pro. They do a great job, and especially because of how portable they are compared to my Bose headphones, even before I got the Vision Pro, I often just brought and used the AirPods Pro when I flew because they were so much more compact and convenient. So if you’re in the market for ANC headphones and think you have to go the over-ear route for great ANC, think again. While of course, you’ll get slightly better ANC with overear headphones, the AirPods Pro, combined with their portability that can fit right in your pocket, make them a great choice that you might want to consider over some more expensive overear headphones.

Now, transparency mode is pretty good, but I often find myself removing the AirPods when I want to talk to someone or hear something in my surroundings. This is mostly because I want someone to know they have my full attention when they’re speaking to me, and so they don’t have to wonder whether I’m listening to them or something in my earbuds. But also, the transparency mode, while good, isn’t quite as clear as just taking them out. It definitely does an impressive job piping in outside noise and voices that make it easy to hear others and your surroundings, but I find I never forget I’m wearing them and consistently have this urge to take them out so that I can hear better. So it’s a helpful feature for when you need to be aware of your surroundings, but it’s always noticeable when I’m wearing them. This is unlike the original AirPods that came out, which I often forgot I was wearing. This makes sense, however, considering the original AirPods are not in-ear buds with a silicone tip seal, unlike the Pros. There’s also this adaptive audio mode, which, to my understanding (I very well may be wrong about this; I also don’t fully understand it), is kind of a blend of ANC and transparency mode. It cancels out loud noises while also allowing you to hear voices and your surroundings that aren’t super loud clearer. I’ve tried this feature and never seemed to like it that much. It often made voices too quiet and didn’t really bring down the noise level of loud sounds that much. So for me, it just felt like a worse version of transparency mode. So because of that, I only toggle between ANC and transparency mode. But both of those modes work pretty well and are a game changer in terms of being able to just cut out your environment at the coffee shop or public place and just concentrate on what you need to. Highly recommend trying out ANC and transparency mode on these earbuds if you have a chance. 

4. Battery Life

Battery life on these AirPods Pro has been satisfactory. Apple rates the buds when they’re brand new at 6 hours of listening time and 4.5 hours of talk time. However, like all batteries, these ones degrade over time, and after over 2 years of daily use, I definitely notice them dying quicker. I usually get around 4-4.5 hours of listening time and 2.5-3 hours of talk time. This is usually more than enough for me, considering I rarely, if ever, have my AirPods in for more than a few hours at a time. And even so, a quick 5-minute charge in the case is rated to get you an additional hour of listening time. In my experience, they charge even quicker. On the rare occasion that I run them fully dead, a quick 10 or so-minute charge almost charges them entirely to full. The case battery has probably degraded a bit, but I haven’t noticed. I put them on my wireless charger every night, and the case battery is never an issue. The AirPods Pro I primarily use are the ones with Lightning, but it’s not a big deal since I exclusively charge them wirelessly (I say “primarily use” because I also have a newer version with USB-C, but I almost never use them; it’s a long story; perhaps I’ll explain it later in this post; we’ll see how I’m feeling). It’s also nice that they can charge with MagSafe and even with an Apple Watch charging puck. So battery life is pretty good. Of course, better battery life is always appreciated, but what we have now is satisfactory. 

5. iOS 18 and the new features coming to AirPods and AirPods Pro 

Some new features are coming to AirPods Pro 2 with the release of iOS 18 and subsequent updates. The biggest of those features is the hearing health features. When you update to iOS 18.1 (and update your AirPods, which really just means you plug them in to charge and hope they update), it’s annoying that you can’t force an update. You’ll be prompted in settings to take a hearing test. This consists of playing various tones and various volumes in each ear, and you tap the screen when you hear a tone. It then gives you a score of how much hearing loss you have, and if you have mild to moderate to severe hearing loss, the AirPods can act as a clinical-grade hearing aid. It then adapts all your music and content to reflect your hearing needs, and you can, of course, use the AirPods as hearing aids. This is genuinely a super great feature and I’m sure it will be revolutionary for so many people, especially considering how expensive medical hearing aids can be. Now, as a young, healthy 21-year-old with superb hearing, I have not been able to test this out, but from what I’ve heard and read online, it works pretty well. Curious how the battery life is and how much power using them as hearing aids takes. Do they die after 6 or so hours and need to be recharged? Or do they last longer? Interesting questions, feel free to let me know in the comments if you know the answer. 

Another hearing feature is hearing protection, where it lowers the volume of loud sounds to safer levels while maintaining clarity and fullness. I’ve used this on numerous occasions, particularly at sporting events and concerts, to bring the noise level down to a level that is much safer and more comfortable. For example, it was able to bring down noise at a baseball game from 100 db down to 65 db. It’s a great feature that I’ll continue to use in place of earplugs. 

Now, those are all features that are coming exclusively to AirPods Pro 2. But there’s also a handful of features that are coming to all newer AirPods, such as Siri Interactions, which allows you to nod and shake your head to respond to Siri if your hands are full or you don’t want to speak out loud. I haven’t had much success with this and haven’t found it to be useful, but perhaps I’m doing something wrong. You also get more granular control over the adaptive audio mode and can choose to allow more or less sound in. Still not going to use it, but more customizability is always appreciated. Also, Spatial Audio while gaming is available for supported games with lower latency. Voice isolation was also brought to the microphones, which, as I mentioned, is a pretty substantial update. But that’s about it in terms of new features brought to the AirPods line. Some great features there that I’m already loving and some others that I don’t really use. But it’s a welcome update regardless. 

6. Noticeable upgrades from the first-gen AirPods Pro

Now there are some noticeable upgrades from my first-gen AirPods Pro that really made it feel worth the upgrade for me. The first upgrade that is a game-changer is volume controls on the stem. I didn’t know how much I used this until I went back to using the first-gen AirPods Pro for a few days before writing this review. I swipe up and down on the stems constantly to adjust the volume, and this is a huge quality-of-life improvement over the first-gen AirPods Pro. The second major change is the improved noise cancellation. It’s noticeably better at cancelling out higher frequencies and overall is a nice improvement. And the last major update is the improved charging case. The speaker on the case makes it easier to find, along with the U1 chip that allows you to use precision finding to locate the case and have it guide you to it using your iPhone or Apple Watch. The new case also has a lanyard loop if you care about that, not something I use but worth noting. And of course, all those features I outlined that come with iOS 18 only come to the 2nd-gen Pros. Also, Apple released the 2nd-gen Pros with an updated USB-C case. I’ll talk about that a bit later, but nothing has officially changed with that version other than that it supports lossless audio when paired with the Vision Pro. There are definitely some noticeable upgrades from the first-gen AirPods Pro that definitely made the upgrade feel worth it for me. 

7. Should you upgrade to the AirPods Pro 2?

The question of whether or not you should upgrade is a difficult one for me to answer as I obviously don’t know you or your situation. With that being said, I think there are some general guidelines that can help you make your decision. First off, which AirPods do you have now, if any? If you have the original AirPods or AirPods 2/3 and the battery is significantly degraded and you’re considering buying a new pair, then these are a great choice, provided of course that you are okay with the silicone ear tips (if not, the AirPods 4 might be the better bet, but I’ll discuss that more in the next section). These will be a nice upgrade over your previous AirPods. Now, if you have the first-gen Pros, then it’s a bit less clear whether upgrading is automatically the right choice. I know for me it was, but that’s only because I had my first-gen Pros for 3 years at that point, and the battery was already significantly degraded. And I was also interested in the new swipe gestures, improved noise cancellation, and precision Find My. So if those features sound interesting to you along with all the features I outlined in the above section, including the hearing features, then upgrading makes sense. But if you’re satisfied with what you have now, stick with it. No need to buy new ones if yours are meeting your needs just fine. 

The one upgrade I will say is not worth it in almost all circumstances is upgrading to the Pro 2s with USB-C if you already have the Pro 2s with Lightning. The only difference is USB-C, of course, along with slightly lower latency and lossless audio support with the Vision Pro. Unless you have a Vision Pro, the last point is moot (and even if you do have a Vision Pro, unless you have connectivity issues with your Lightning AirPods Pro 2 like I was having, lossless audio and lower latency is really not noticeable).  And in terms of USB-C charging, I have a 3-in-1 charging stand on my bedside table that charges my AirPods wirelessly. I can’t even remember the last time I plugged in my AirPods with a Lightning cable. So even if you’re totally switched over to USB-C and ready to leave Lightning behind, I don’t think spending $250 on a new pair just to get USB-C is worth it. Just charge them wirelessly, it’s so much more convenient anyways.

Now I may sound like a bit of a hypocrite considering I said I actually did buy the Pro 2s with USB-C, but I’m a bit of a niche case. So I was on vacation in New Orleans and went to the Apple Store because it seemed like my Lightning AirPods Pro 2 had terrible noise cancellation in the right earbud. In my infinite wisdom, I had missed that the right silicone tip had a tear in it and was leaking sound in. So I inquired about getting new ear tips, but unfortunately, the store was entirely out of medium-sized ear tips; in fact, they were out of all but the XS ear tips, which absolutely do not fit my ears. I was traveling the next day and needed working AirPods for my flight home. So the employee suggested that I could buy a whole new set of AirPods Pro, use them for my flight home, and then return them. This was an expensive solution for the time being, but it seemed like the only way. So I ended up using those on the flight home with my Vision Pro. I had actually been experiencing some connectivity issues with my Lightning AirPods Pro 2 when using the Vision Pro, and I had none of these issues when using the USB-C AirPods Pro with the Vision Pro. So I actually ended up keeping the USB-C AirPods Pro, but I keep them in my Vision Pro case and only use them with my Vision Pro. Day to day, I still use the Lightning AirPods Pro 2 and plan to continue doing so as I don’t have any connectivity issues with the Lightning AirPods Pro 2 with any of my devices other than my Vision Pro, which is strange. So this is a niche case I’m sure, and for most people, I don’t think it’s worth upgrading to the Pro 2s with USB-C from the Pro 2s with Lightning.

8. AirPods Pro 2 vs AirPods 4

With the recent launch of the AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation, many people were excited to have ANC in an open earbud. I know for many people the AirPods Pro with silicone tips are just uncomfortable, and these new AirPods seemed like potentially a solution for those who want ANC but don’t like the in-ear fit. I actually bought the AirPods 4 because I loved the fit of the original AirPods. The AirPods Pro have always been comfortable for me, but I also never forget I’m wearing them. That was not the case with the original AirPods. They fit so well in my ears that I would genuinely forget I was wearing them. So if I could get high-quality noise cancellation along with a fit that was so comfortable I would forget I was wearing them, I was definitely going to check them out. So I went to the Apple Store to pick them up. I had some grocery shopping to do and planned on using them while I shopped to test how the noise cancellation would do in a public environment. I was massively disappointed. I tried using them for about 5-10 minutes, but there was so much sound leakage due to the open ear design. I went back to the AirPods Pro and was relieved at how much better the ANC was. After shopping, I returned the AirPods 4 to the Apple Store, less than half an hour after I bought them. In my experience, they were inferior to the Pros in every way. One big issue I had with them, even in the 5-10 minutes I used them, was the lack of volume controls on the stems. I tried multiple times to adjust the volume and disappointedly discovered that the stems only have touch controls for pause, play, and skip, but not swipe controls for volume. 

Now, this is not to say that the AirPods 4 aren’t for you. If you really hate the fit and feel of the AirPods Pro in-ear design, then perhaps the AirPods 4 are for you. But it’s important to keep in mind that nothing can replace an actual seal. At the end of the day, having an open ear design will allow more sound leakage and poorer ANC than an in-ear design. If you go from the Pros to AirPods 4, you will be underwhelmed by the quality of the ANC. Also, the price differential between AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro is basically negligible, considering that the Pros often go on sale on Amazon for $200 and even less. I remember them going for as low as $168 a few weeks ago, and with Black Friday fast approaching, it is almost certain that there will be great deals on the Pros. So, my advice is if you can tolerate the in-ear fit of the AirPods Pro, I highly recommend buying them over the AirPods 4, as they are superior in virtually every way. But definitely go to an Apple Store and try them out if you can. They’ll usually let you try them out for yourself to see how they fit.

Final Thoughts

If you’re just skipping to this section because your attention span has been destroyed by TikTok, I feel you. Here are my final thoughts and a TLDR. I really like the AirPods Pro 2. I think they’re overall a really good pair of earbuds and have been a great and worthwhile purchase for me. I’m very satisfied with the design and build quality. The battery life holds up very well after 2 years, and they continue to get better with software updates. If you find the AirPods Pro comfortable, I highly recommend them over the AirPods 4 as they’re superior in every way. But regardless, both are great earbuds that I’m sure you’ll enjoy.

If you’ve read this far, thank you very much for reading my ramblings! Let me know your thoughts as well! Which AirPods do you have/are you considering getting, and if you have AirPods, what are your thoughts? Can’t wait to hear what you all have to say!

Apple Intelligence Summary

The AirPods Pro 2 have a comfortable design with durable buds and a well-designed case, although the case scratches easily and the charging pins are sensitive to debris. The sound quality is impressive, with clear audio and good microphone quality, although some features like Conversation Awareness are less practical. The Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) is effective in blocking out consistent noises and unpredictable noises that are low in volume, making them a great choice for travel and everyday use.

The AirPods Pro offer excellent noise cancellation and transparency modes, though the latter is not as clear as removing the earbuds. Battery life is adequate, with quick charging capabilities providing additional listening time. New features in iOS 18, including hearing health and protection, are particularly noteworthy, especially for those with hearing loss.

Upgrading to AirPods Pro 2 is recommended if you have the original AirPods or AirPods 2/3 with a degraded battery, or if you have the first-gen Pros and are interested in the new features. Upgrading to the Pro 2s with USB-C from the Pro 2s with Lightning is not recommended unless you have connectivity issues with the Lightning version and need the feature for a specific device. The AirPods 4 are not recommended over the Pro 2s due to inferior noise cancellation and lack of volume controls.",3,1732084731.0,AirpodsPro,4,0.71,False

M23 F21,"My bf and I have been together for about 5 months now. He is the love of my life everything has been going great, our story is like a fairytale and he’s honestly the one I see myself spending the rest of my life with. He treats me like a princess, our families go well together and he is actually so madly and deeply in love with me as well.

All is wonderful except a few instances of him talking to an ex. Him and this ex only went out a few times, not even on full dates just to the bar, and he told me he never slept with her until recently I found out he did and he said “idk I thought I told you before”. He told me he no longer talked to this woman until I found texts between them just chatting about everyday life but it seemed a little flirty, I recall 2 smirking emojis. Obviously I confronted him and he said they occasionally worked together(which is true) but he knew I didn’t like it and said he wouldn’t do it anymore. 

Flash forward two months on one of my visits to him I went back to those messages to find more recent ones between them about getting coffee and chatting. We were going through a rough patch and in the texts it was expressed that “he could use a good talk” and he told me that he just wanted someone to talk to and bounce ideas off of. There are a lot of big decisions and whatnot regarding our relationships rn so. They never ended up going on this coffee chat whatever the fuck but he was still planning it??? We had a huge fight and he understood and told me it wouldn’t happen again and that he deleted her contact info etc. He’s been nothing but great and loyal and loving since then and we haven’t been fighting almost as all compared to when we first went long distance. 

The as of recent finding out about them actually sleeping together set me off as he told me they were just friends and maybe I could wrap my head around that, but texting someone and planning to get coffee with someone you’ve slept with before?? Hell no.
I asked to look through his phone and now he’s being weird and is saying no. I’m not sure if I’m actually just over reacting or does everyone else feel like this in these cases?? They have to right? I’m so sad and disappointed because he is actually perfect for me and I want to spend my life with him and I can just tell that THIS IS THE ONE but I’m worried these trust issues will cause a problem later down the line.

1gvjg9a,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gvjg9a,AirPods Pro 2: Long-Term Review ,"TLDR in the form of an Apple Intelligence Summary at the end

So I’ve had the AirPods Pro Second Generation since launch and wanted to share my thoughts about them after over 2 years of daily use. I upgraded from the 1st Generation AirPods Pro, which I also had since they launched, and liked them a lot. And before that, I had the original AirPods, which I also loved. So I think it’s safe to say I’m well-credentialed in my knowledge of AirPods and their use in everyday life. I’m going to break down this review into sections: Design, Sound Quality, Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) and Transparency mode, battery life, experience using iOS 18 and the new features it brings to AirPods, noticeable upgrades from my first-gen AirPods Pro, whether it’s worth upgrading to from a previous pair of AirPods, whether you should choose AirPods Pro or the new AirPods 4 with ANC, and Final Thoughts. Feel free to not read all of it or skip around. I’m mainly writing this because it’s interesting to me, and hopefully, some of you in this sub will find it interesting as well.  

1. Design

I really like the design of the AirPods Pro. I find the silicone tips to be quite comfortable, and the standard medium-sized tips have always worked best for my ears. The buds are quite durable, and they have a few knicks and scratches from when I’ve dropped the buds, but they still work perfectly fine. I’ve had to replace the tips a couple of times as they slowly wear and yellow, but that’s not a huge deal since you can get 2 pairs for $8. The case is well designed as well for the most part. I like the speaker on the bottom, that has helped me find them on countless occasions when they slip in between my couch cushions. The case still scratches incredibly easily, which is a bummer but not a huge deal as it’s just cosmetic. I had a case on the AirPods case for most of the time since launch to prevent scratches but removed it recently. I had super glued the top of the case on since it kept falling off, and in order to get it off, I had to pry it off with a knife, which left a lot of scratches and residue. Fortunately, I was able to get rid of most of the residue, but the case doesn’t look good. I have come to believe that AirPods cases are largely a mistake. They just make them more bulky and don’t do that much to protect them. The case does scratch pretty easily considering it’s glossy white, but it’s really just something you have to accept. One annoying design feature is that when you drop the case, the AirPods often go flying out of the case upon impact. This is exactly the opposite of what you’d want to happen if you drop the case. It would be nice if they fixed it in the next version, perhaps by increasing the strength of the magnets. Also, the charging pins in the case are quite sensitive to dust or debris. On multiple occasions, one of the AirPods won’t charge and will be low on battery when I want to use them. It’s not a deal breaker as it’s usually not an issue, but I have to check to make sure they’re charging when I put them in the case, which is not terrible, but it’s less convenient than just putting them in the case when you’re done using them and knowing they’ll be charged when you use them next. So overall, the design is great, and I’m super satisfied with them. A few downsides in terms of cosmetic durability, but otherwise great.

2. Sound Quality and Sound Features

Now, I’m not an audiophile whatsoever, but I will say I appreciate high-quality audio, and I’m not disappointed with the AirPods Pro 2. Music sounds clear, there’s a decent amount of bass, mids, and highs are also clear. Obviously, a pair of over-ear headphones like AirPods Max will have better sound quality and bass due to having much larger drivers, but for the size of the earbud, they’re super impressive. I don’t have much more to say about the audio quality. It’s more than adequate for me, and that’s what matters. Microphone quality is also pretty good. The noise isolation feature is super impressive in loud environments. I FaceTimed a friend from an MLB game, and she said my voice sounded a bit muffled, but she didn’t hear any of the background noise even though it was super loud. Obviously, the mics aren’t anything you’d want to use for professional recordings or in any place where clarity is super important, but for most phone calls and meetings, the microphones on the AirPods are adequate. So the sound and mic quality are great, and for the overwhelming majority of people, it will be more than adequate.

There are some other sound features that are nice to have. Personalized Spatial Audio is a nice feature that not only enables Spatial Audio when watching content, but also requires you to scan your ears with your iPhone for the best listening experience. Conversation awareness is an interesting feature but one that I actually turned off. Basically, it lowers the volume of your audio if it thinks someone is talking to you or if you start talking, and while in theory, this seems great, it rarely works well in practice. When I had it enabled, it often would bring down the volume of my audio when I was merely in public with other people talking near me, or if I was singing along to a song or even coughing. So I ended up turning that feature off.  There’s also features like personalized volume that apparently uses machine learning to adjust the sound based on your environment. Once again, cool in theory, but I’d rather just adjust the volume myself. Lots of cool features for adjusting sound, except for built-in EQ controls. Apple allows you to change the EQ of music in the settings for Apple Music, but that obviously only applies to music in Apple Music. It would be nice if you could change the EQ system-wide, but customization has never been Apple’s top priority. We’re just now gaining the ability to put apps “wherever” we want on the Home Screen. Perhaps I’m asking for too much. 

3. Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) and Transparency Mode

When the first-gen AirPods Pro were announced with Active Noise Cancellation, I immediately bought them. I loved the original AirPods, but since they were just an earbud with no seal, it meant that any background noise was easily heard even when music was playing. I absolutely love ANC and transparency mode. In my experience, the ANC is good at blocking out most consistent noises at lower frequencies. The low hum of my AC unit or fan is almost completely canceled out by the ANC, and even some more unpredictable noises that are at lower volumes are canceled out. There’s a dog across the street from my house who sometimes sits outside and barks constantly for hours. I am able to faintly hear the barking in my bedroom, but when I put in the AirPods Pro and turn on ANC, the barking completely vanishes. I’ve also had pretty good success using the AirPods Pro with ANC on airplanes. I used to fly with my Bose QC35s because they were overear headphones that did a better job canceling the noise of the engine, and they still do a better job than the AirPods Pro, but once again, the AirPods hold their own. The ANC is impressive at blocking out the noise. Ever since getting the Apple Vision Pro, I’ve used the AirPods Pro exclusively when flying since over-ear headphones don’t really work with the Vision Pro. They do a great job, and especially because of how portable they are compared to my Bose headphones, even before I got the Vision Pro, I often just brought and used the AirPods Pro when I flew because they were so much more compact and convenient. So if you’re in the market for ANC headphones and think you have to go the over-ear route for great ANC, think again. While of course, you’ll get slightly better ANC with overear headphones, the AirPods Pro, combined with their portability that can fit right in your pocket, make them a great choice that you might want to consider over some more expensive overear headphones.

Now, transparency mode is pretty good, but I often find myself removing the AirPods when I want to talk to someone or hear something in my surroundings. This is mostly because I want someone to know they have my full attention when they’re speaking to me, and so they don’t have to wonder whether I’m listening to them or something in my earbuds. But also, the transparency mode, while good, isn’t quite as clear as just taking them out. It definitely does an impressive job piping in outside noise and voices that make it easy to hear others and your surroundings, but I find I never forget I’m wearing them and consistently have this urge to take them out so that I can hear better. So it’s a helpful feature for when you need to be aware of your surroundings, but it’s always noticeable when I’m wearing them. This is unlike the original AirPods that came out, which I often forgot I was wearing. This makes sense, however, considering the original AirPods are not in-ear buds with a silicone tip seal, unlike the Pros. There’s also this adaptive audio mode, which, to my understanding (I very well may be wrong about this; I also don’t fully understand it), is kind of a blend of ANC and transparency mode. It cancels out loud noises while also allowing you to hear voices and your surroundings that aren’t super loud clearer. I’ve tried this feature and never seemed to like it that much. It often made voices too quiet and didn’t really bring down the noise level of loud sounds that much. So for me, it just felt like a worse version of transparency mode. So because of that, I only toggle between ANC and transparency mode. But both of those modes work pretty well and are a game changer in terms of being able to just cut out your environment at the coffee shop or public place and just concentrate on what you need to. Highly recommend trying out ANC and transparency mode on these earbuds if you have a chance. 

4. Battery Life

Battery life on these AirPods Pro has been satisfactory. Apple rates the buds when they’re brand new at 6 hours of listening time and 4.5 hours of talk time. However, like all batteries, these ones degrade over time, and after over 2 years of daily use, I definitely notice them dying quicker. I usually get around 4-4.5 hours of listening time and 2.5-3 hours of talk time. This is usually more than enough for me, considering I rarely, if ever, have my AirPods in for more than a few hours at a time. And even so, a quick 5-minute charge in the case is rated to get you an additional hour of listening time. In my experience, they charge even quicker. On the rare occasion that I run them fully dead, a quick 10 or so-minute charge almost charges them entirely to full. The case battery has probably degraded a bit, but I haven’t noticed. I put them on my wireless charger every night, and the case battery is never an issue. The AirPods Pro I primarily use are the ones with Lightning, but it’s not a big deal since I exclusively charge them wirelessly (I say “primarily use” because I also have a newer version with USB-C, but I almost never use them; it’s a long story; perhaps I’ll explain it later in this post; we’ll see how I’m feeling). It’s also nice that they can charge with MagSafe and even with an Apple Watch charging puck. So battery life is pretty good. Of course, better battery life is always appreciated, but what we have now is satisfactory. 

5. iOS 18 and the new features coming to AirPods and AirPods Pro 

Some new features are coming to AirPods Pro 2 with the release of iOS 18 and subsequent updates. The biggest of those features is the hearing health features. When you update to iOS 18.1 (and update your AirPods, which really just means you plug them in to charge and hope they update), it’s annoying that you can’t force an update. You’ll be prompted in settings to take a hearing test. This consists of playing various tones and various volumes in each ear, and you tap the screen when you hear a tone. It then gives you a score of how much hearing loss you have, and if you have mild to moderate to severe hearing loss, the AirPods can act as a clinical-grade hearing aid. It then adapts all your music and content to reflect your hearing needs, and you can, of course, use the AirPods as hearing aids. This is genuinely a super great feature and I’m sure it will be revolutionary for so many people, especially considering how expensive medical hearing aids can be. Now, as a young, healthy 21-year-old with superb hearing, I have not been able to test this out, but from what I’ve heard and read online, it works pretty well. Curious how the battery life is and how much power using them as hearing aids takes. Do they die after 6 or so hours and need to be recharged? Or do they last longer? Interesting questions, feel free to let me know in the comments if you know the answer. 

Another hearing feature is hearing protection, where it lowers the volume of loud sounds to safer levels while maintaining clarity and fullness. I’ve used this on numerous occasions, particularly at sporting events and concerts, to bring the noise level down to a level that is much safer and more comfortable. For example, it was able to bring down noise at a baseball game from 100 db down to 65 db. It’s a great feature that I’ll continue to use in place of earplugs. 

Now, those are all features that are coming exclusively to AirPods Pro 2. But there’s also a handful of features that are coming to all newer AirPods, such as Siri Interactions, which allows you to nod and shake your head to respond to Siri if your hands are full or you don’t want to speak out loud. I haven’t had much success with this and haven’t found it to be useful, but perhaps I’m doing something wrong. You also get more granular control over the adaptive audio mode and can choose to allow more or less sound in. Still not going to use it, but more customizability is always appreciated. Also, Spatial Audio while gaming is available for supported games with lower latency. Voice isolation was also brought to the microphones, which, as I mentioned, is a pretty substantial update. But that’s about it in terms of new features brought to the AirPods line. Some great features there that I’m already loving and some others that I don’t really use. But it’s a welcome update regardless. 

6. Noticeable upgrades from the first-gen AirPods Pro

Now there are some noticeable upgrades from my first-gen AirPods Pro that really made it feel worth the upgrade for me. The first upgrade that is a game-changer is volume controls on the stem. I didn’t know how much I used this until I went back to using the first-gen AirPods Pro for a few days before writing this review. I swipe up and down on the stems constantly to adjust the volume, and this is a huge quality-of-life improvement over the first-gen AirPods Pro. The second major change is the improved noise cancellation. It’s noticeably better at cancelling out higher frequencies and overall is a nice improvement. And the last major update is the improved charging case. The speaker on the case makes it easier to find, along with the U1 chip that allows you to use precision finding to locate the case and have it guide you to it using your iPhone or Apple Watch. The new case also has a lanyard loop if you care about that, not something I use but worth noting. And of course, all those features I outlined that come with iOS 18 only come to the 2nd-gen Pros. Also, Apple released the 2nd-gen Pros with an updated USB-C case. I’ll talk about that a bit later, but nothing has officially changed with that version other than that it supports lossless audio when paired with the Vision Pro. There are definitely some noticeable upgrades from the first-gen AirPods Pro that definitely made the upgrade feel worth it for me. 

7. Should you upgrade to the AirPods Pro 2?

The question of whether or not you should upgrade is a difficult one for me to answer as I obviously don’t know you or your situation. With that being said, I think there are some general guidelines that can help you make your decision. First off, which AirPods do you have now, if any? If you have the original AirPods or AirPods 2/3 and the battery is significantly degraded and you’re considering buying a new pair, then these are a great choice, provided of course that you are okay with the silicone ear tips (if not, the AirPods 4 might be the better bet, but I’ll discuss that more in the next section). These will be a nice upgrade over your previous AirPods. Now, if you have the first-gen Pros, then it’s a bit less clear whether upgrading is automatically the right choice. I know for me it was, but that’s only because I had my first-gen Pros for 3 years at that point, and the battery was already significantly degraded. And I was also interested in the new swipe gestures, improved noise cancellation, and precision Find My. So if those features sound interesting to you along with all the features I outlined in the above section, including the hearing features, then upgrading makes sense. But if you’re satisfied with what you have now, stick with it. No need to buy new ones if yours are meeting your needs just fine. 

The one upgrade I will say is not worth it in almost all circumstances is upgrading to the Pro 2s with USB-C if you already have the Pro 2s with Lightning. The only difference is USB-C, of course, along with slightly lower latency and lossless audio support with the Vision Pro. Unless you have a Vision Pro, the last point is moot (and even if you do have a Vision Pro, unless you have connectivity issues with your Lightning AirPods Pro 2 like I was having, lossless audio and lower latency is really not noticeable).  And in terms of USB-C charging, I have a 3-in-1 charging stand on my bedside table that charges my AirPods wirelessly. I can’t even remember the last time I plugged in my AirPods with a Lightning cable. So even if you’re totally switched over to USB-C and ready to leave Lightning behind, I don’t think spending $250 on a new pair just to get USB-C is worth it. Just charge them wirelessly, it’s so much more convenient anyways.

Now I may sound like a bit of a hypocrite considering I said I actually did buy the Pro 2s with USB-C, but I’m a bit of a niche case. So I was on vacation in New Orleans and went to the Apple Store because it seemed like my Lightning AirPods Pro 2 had terrible noise cancellation in the right earbud. In my infinite wisdom, I had missed that the right silicone tip had a tear in it and was leaking sound in. So I inquired about getting new ear tips, but unfortunately, the store was entirely out of medium-sized ear tips; in fact, they were out of all but the XS ear tips, which absolutely do not fit my ears. I was traveling the next day and needed working AirPods for my flight home. So the employee suggested that I could buy a whole new set of AirPods Pro, use them for my flight home, and then return them. This was an expensive solution for the time being, but it seemed like the only way. So I ended up using those on the flight home with my Vision Pro. I had actually been experiencing some connectivity issues with my Lightning AirPods Pro 2 when using the Vision Pro, and I had none of these issues when using the USB-C AirPods Pro with the Vision Pro. So I actually ended up keeping the USB-C AirPods Pro, but I keep them in my Vision Pro case and only use them with my Vision Pro. Day to day, I still use the Lightning AirPods Pro 2 and plan to continue doing so as I don’t have any connectivity issues with the Lightning AirPods Pro 2 with any of my devices other than my Vision Pro, which is strange. So this is a niche case I’m sure, and for most people, I don’t think it’s worth upgrading to the Pro 2s with USB-C from the Pro 2s with Lightning.

8. AirPods Pro 2 vs AirPods 4

With the recent launch of the AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation, many people were excited to have ANC in an open earbud. I know for many people the AirPods Pro with silicone tips are just uncomfortable, and these new AirPods seemed like potentially a solution for those who want ANC but don’t like the in-ear fit. I actually bought the AirPods 4 because I loved the fit of the original AirPods. The AirPods Pro have always been comfortable for me, but I also never forget I’m wearing them. That was not the case with the original AirPods. They fit so well in my ears that I would genuinely forget I was wearing them. So if I could get high-quality noise cancellation along with a fit that was so comfortable I would forget I was wearing them, I was definitely going to check them out. So I went to the Apple Store to pick them up. I had some grocery shopping to do and planned on using them while I shopped to test how the noise cancellation would do in a public environment. I was massively disappointed. I tried using them for about 5-10 minutes, but there was so much sound leakage due to the open ear design. I went back to the AirPods Pro and was relieved at how much better the ANC was. After shopping, I returned the AirPods 4 to the Apple Store, less than half an hour after I bought them. In my experience, they were inferior to the Pros in every way. One big issue I had with them, even in the 5-10 minutes I used them, was the lack of volume controls on the stems. I tried multiple times to adjust the volume and disappointedly discovered that the stems only have touch controls for pause, play, and skip, but not swipe controls for volume. 

Now, this is not to say that the AirPods 4 aren’t for you. If you really hate the fit and feel of the AirPods Pro in-ear design, then perhaps the AirPods 4 are for you. But it’s important to keep in mind that nothing can replace an actual seal. At the end of the day, having an open ear design will allow more sound leakage and poorer ANC than an in-ear design. If you go from the Pros to AirPods 4, you will be underwhelmed by the quality of the ANC. Also, the price differential between AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro is basically negligible, considering that the Pros often go on sale on Amazon for $200 and even less. I remember them going for as low as $168 a few weeks ago, and with Black Friday fast approaching, it is almost certain that there will be great deals on the Pros. So, my advice is if you can tolerate the in-ear fit of the AirPods Pro, I highly recommend buying them over the AirPods 4, as they are superior in virtually every way. But definitely go to an Apple Store and try them out if you can. They’ll usually let you try them out for yourself to see how they fit.

Final Thoughts

If you’re just skipping to this section because your attention span has been destroyed by TikTok, I feel you. Here are my final thoughts and a TLDR. I really like the AirPods Pro 2. I think they’re overall a really good pair of earbuds and have been a great and worthwhile purchase for me. I’m very satisfied with the design and build quality. The battery life holds up very well after 2 years, and they continue to get better with software updates. If you find the AirPods Pro comfortable, I highly recommend them over the AirPods 4 as they’re superior in every way. But regardless, both are great earbuds that I’m sure you’ll enjoy.

My younger brother narrowly avoided getting scammed this past Tuesday. It was the well known tinder dating app scam that is known in Delhi but he wasn't aware of it.

For those unaware about this scam, you can read more about it here -

https://www.reddit.com/r/delhi/s/Zc0Mv9ukVq

https://www.reddit.com/r/delhi/s/ifD2nm5Ao7

https://www.reddit.com/r/delhi/s/idqVbNO3Pz

Here's how it went down -
Brother was casually chatting with a girl on Bumble, who said she was from Delhi but living in Koramangala from the past three years and everything seemed legit. She spoke well in fluent English, seemed to have travelled internationally (even knew about places and museums in Italy) and had indepth knowledge of the job she said she was working in. 

After a couple of days ie Tuesday, he happened to tell her that he was at the moment in electronics city in his office. 

Next, this is what happened:

After a few hrs, she suddenly reached out told him that they could catch up in JP nagar - we live in JP Nagar 8th phase, and close to Meenakshi mall. Says she will suggest a place there, however after sometime asks him to come over to a place known as Macca or something near Singasandra on Hosur rd which is not at all in JP nagar or even close to it.

Infact, it is quite closeby for him at EC, but my brother wanted to meet in JP nagar or Koramangala and I think one reason (which he didn't tell me) was that he had gone to office on his bike. He wanted to come home and take my car instead.
So he suggests an artistic cafe in Koramangala is better, but she says I have already been to that place. He then proceeds to suggest a couple of other places in BTM layout, all because he anyway has to come to JP nagar to take my car.

After sometime she calls back, repeats her earlier suggestion and adds that she has already come to meet her friend in electronics city and since both of them are already there, they can go to that place on Hosur rd. 
But by then by brother has already left Electronics city and is rushing home. He tells her he is on Nice rd and cannot turn back since there is no exit and he will reach JP nagar anyway. So he asks her to stick to the original plan.

She agrees saying that she will take a cab back to Koramanagala and asks him to drop her back to her friend's place in EC. My brother agrees to this, comes home, gives me an excuse and takes the car keys.
By the time he reaches IIMB/Apollo hospital, she calls again asking for his number. Then she proceeds to inform him that Macca is much closer to him than the cafe in Koramangala, but my brother stalls her saying that he is already in JP nagar and is proceeding towards Koramangala. Again he asks her to stick to the original plan.

The final question she then asks him is - if you are willing to travel to EC to drop me, why not come there now itself and meet me here? 
Her insistence on him coming to that Macca is already getting him suspicious so he again says its not workable, since it will take him a long time to reach there and it will be very late at night. Instead they could meet a bit earlier in Koramangala and then he could drop her to EC even if it gets late.

She says OK and ends the call. His chat window is open as he is driving and a few mins later he notices that the chat has been cleared. He stops the car and msgs Hi, which then gets deleted and the chat window closes (telegram). He then again searches for her ID, but now he is blocked.

So he msgs from another number and she responds that he was trying to meet her very late at night which is very scary and she doubts his intention now. The idiot that he is, he asks to meet in the afternoon next day, but she says she is not interested and says anti south Indian racist rants before blocking him again.

So then my brother returns home and tells me the whole story. I think he was saved mainly because of two reasons
- He wanted to meet in JP nagar or Koramangala because he wanted to take the car
- I had already warned him not to meet anyone at an expensive place for the first time
This is mainly because I had already heard about people on apps demanding to meet at a high end place and then immediately after, they will block you on all apps or social media (just to score free food and drinks at an expensive place)

I then told him to follow the below rules in future (which I am telling everyone here - feel free to add anything useful to this list)

1. First and foremost, the first meeting should always be at a coffee shop and of a well known chain like CCD or TWC. No shady, unknown or expensive places.
2. Do not agree to any sudden plans or sudden change of plan. Till you know her well, do not make last min plans at any cost
3. Wherever you go, ask to meet her outside the restaurant or pub first. Do not let her go inside and order food and drinks while waiting for you.
4. If the #3 happens and you dont know about it, then ask her to close the bill and either move to a different table or to a different restaurant entirely.
5. Always and always check the menu and prices before ordering, whether its you who is ordering or her.

Unfortunately, my idiot brother is not convinced that this could have been a scam. The reasons he is giving are
- She spoke fluent English and seemed to be from a good background
- She had integrated well in Bangalore, spoke many kannada words and knew the local culture well. It wasn't like she landed here yesterday or something.
- She seemed to have travelled internationally and knew many places and museums in Italy
- She said she was working as a manager in a mega retailer (an MBA position) and seemed to have indepth knowledge of that sector
- She said she had a scary experience on her last date with a tamil guy, which has made her very careful about where and how she meets new people
(I can explain this if you are interested in the comments section)

At this time I honestly don't care whether he is convinced or not, I just told him to the follow the above rules.

My partner and I are visiting Bangkok (first time!) Dec 5 - 9 and are looking for the right area to stay in for us. I'm getting a bit overwhelmed due to the sheer vastness of Bangkok and our extremely limited time. I did read the suggestions of being near BST or MRT stations but it seems even with using these services the transit time to go around the city will be long.

We are hoping to stay at a property that is in an area where we can walk (good sidwalk or roads) and explore without trying to rush around to attraction or tourist points. Or that would be a really good central point to visit across Bangkok.  Besides that our wishlists are a big vague but we hope to get great street food, experience night life & go to a Muay Thai fight.

To sound as less simpy as possible I clicked with her very quickly. I did ask about her beliefs and while she doesn’t associate herself with religion she does believe in God (her words nearly verbatim). So despite the lack of a specific denomination I do like that she’s Christian (I’m assuming she’s not like “oh maybe Allah is real for Islam” or anything although I do WANT to clarify that with her 

Now… I suggested we could grab coffee, which of course gives off date vibes 

But to be honest sometimes I’m own good mindset and sometimes I’m not. I don’t know if I’m emotionally ready enough to date her and I don’t know if God is willing it for me and her to be together or if both of us are not fit for each other, whether on her end or cuz of me being some emotionally unintelligent moron.

Since about two years I have this coffe plants, that where doing great untill now. About two months ago i moved, the same time both started to get sick. 

First they startet turning yellow (e.g. picture 5), what i tried to treat with iron fertilizer. that helped, at least the leafes are getting more green. Parallel to turning yellow, they startet to get the brown/black spots that are getting larger till the whole leave is brown and dropped. Sadly, his hasn't stopped, this is a ongoing problem. An example of some of the dropped leaves is shown in the last picture.

The room they are in is about 20°C and to help with the humidity they are getting more or less regularly sprayed with water. The window is located on the west side, thats the best I can do, because there is no south facing window.

I just did a trail of both and I put them straight in hot coffee and tea and they both dissolve easily so I don’t see any problems with consuming it. Though a little more nauseous with gelatin if I use too much at once. And the NIH resource is both are highly bio available, with the peptide more absorbed and faster.

Florecent lights buzzed overhead as I plopped my purse on my desk. The smell of dust and stale coffee permeated the air as a stale box of donuts lay on the desk beside me, attracting flies. The suns last rays set in the horizon, making the changing leaves glow. I longed to take a walk outside and breath the cool crisp air, but it would be dark soon and I had to clock in. 

“Do you have any plans for Halloween,” said Rob, my coworker. “We’re taking the kids out to trunk or treat out at our church meet up on Sunday.”

I put my head down and rolled my eyes. “Samhain, I celebrate Samhain, and I’ve taken off the last week of October,” I said under my breath. I was stuck in this dreary office and time couldn’t pass fast enough, and here was Mr. Family man asking me to cover for him.

“What?”

“I’m taking off next week, I have other plans,” I said.

“So you can’t cover my shift on Sunday? The kids were looking forward to trunk or treat.”

“Ask Dave, he practically lives here, he’ll take your shift if he hasn’t already.” 

“I would but Dave is out for the weekend.”

“Rob, I’ve already picked up a shift for you last week, please check the schedule for someone else, this holiday is important to me.” My hands curled into fists and I gritted my teeth, the nerve of some coworkers.

The loading ticker showed on my desk, taking a full five minutes to log in. 

:Ericka! It’s great to see you. Got anything planned, bestie?:

I smiled at Angie’s message, ah at least some conversation to break up the monotony of my shift tonight.

:Yeah, I’m going to hang out with some friends, did you want to come out with us?:

:I wish I could , but I’m working overtime tomorrow, then I have to pack up.:

:Well, I hope you have fun.:

:I will.:

Sometimes I wish I had more time in the day. Angie and I would spend time in between calls and projects to joke or complain about the system crashing. However , working on night shift crushed most plans for hanging out. Nothing was open after we got off work except for the emergency room and truck stops. I also commuted forty minutes to work and back and ended up staying home on my days off. Perhaps when I got back from vacation I’d make more time to spend with them, attend group functions. Who am I kidding? Then I’d have to spend time with Rob and his family as well, yikes. No, when I returned I would treat Angie out for coffee, just hang out at Starbucks down the road. Anything to break the monotony.

I sighed and went back to reading my email. Kale666@gmail, jumped out in red letters. It was obvious spam, but they weren’t wrong, kale is the devil. 

As soon as i clicked delete the screen tuned a sickly yellow hue and the letters turned blood red. The words became mangled and began to melt down the screen.

I swore under my breath, there was a virus embedded into this demonic salad. Now I had to call IT, all to have some condescending jaskass mansplain to me about clicking outside emails or remote into my sytem. Right when I was about to dial the overhead lights dimmed before winking out into darkness, along with my phone and computer.

A flashlight glowed as a few security guards came to check out the breaker room. 

“We’ll get the generator back up in no time, you guys sit tight, ” said Ralph. The kindly old man was the the head security guard. With him stood Jarvis, a laid back security guard that held the flashlight.

Another loud hum and the generator kicked up, shoving a plume of dark smoke into the air. 

“We’re having an electrical outage. I’m going to need y’all to move to building two,” said Ralph.

I sighed, very well, I would pack my stuff and play musical cubicles until they got the problem resolved. Hopefully I’d be able to log into my phone and complete my before the night ended. The lights flashed again as Ralph grumbled.

We packed up our things to move to the building next door. This night couldn’t end soon enough, but at least I’d be off for the week after my shift.

I tried to turn my computer on one last time to sign out, this time the screen lit up black with blood red drips of code oozing down the page. Random letters filling out the word ZALGO. Zalgo? I remembered hearing about Zalgo as some internet boogeyman, some dark god that infected coding.

Ralph let out an agonizing scream as his his body floated in in the air. I froze as a spindly figure slammed him repeatedly against the floor. He screamed until his voice became wet gurgles. The creature tossed against the wall, leaving a trail of blood as he slid down. 

“GET OUT!” I screamed at the creature as I pushed all my will at it. I was terrified, but also angry that this creature, this bug would dare terrorize me at my work. Oh, this was on like donky kong.

The spindly creature screamed and unnatural high pitched sound before fading into the wall. Pressure surrounded me and the air grew freezing. My breath came out in cold puffs against the dimming florescent lights. Rob coward under his desk, whispering the lords prayer, I knelt down beside him. 

“This has to be a dream, some nightmare. I’m going to wake up next to my wife in a few minutes,” his eyes were desperate and gleaming with tears.

“I’m afraid not. We’re going to have to dig our heels in and fight. The only way out of this is through-”

“What are you talking about?”

“Long story, I’ll explain later we don’t have time.”

“I’m going to need y’all to stay down!” said Jarvis. His laid back demeanor changed, his eyes became hard as he crouched and explored the territory, he held out a taser in front of him. 

His radio made a static garbled sound as the lights flickered around us. Jarvis walked along side the wall, nervously glancing at the perimeter. I curled under my desk, numb from shock. 

Movement flashed in the inky blackness, and I crawled under the desk next to Rob. A shadow in the darkness out of the corner of my eye that would slip back into the shadows when I looked at it head on.

All I wanted was a day off, I had put in weeks of overtime to have this vacation and this thing was not going to take it away from me. I needed to find Jarvis , pull the fire alarm and run the hell out of dodge. Let the authorities or a priest deal with this. What happened to Ralph was horrible and I would not let that happen to anyone else. I wasn’t about to sit around and play victim to this thing.

I inched carefully towards Robs desk, and tapped him on the shoulder. He turned around and bear hugged me so tight the air was knocked out of me. 

“I have a wife and kids. Oh God, what did I do to deserve any of this?”

“Dude, I can’t breath.”

He released his grip on me as the air rushed back into my lungs.

“Sorry,” he said.

“It’s fine. The second thing I need you to do is to stop panicking. I have a plan to escape, but we’re going to have to find Jarvis.”

“But he’s security, he can handle himself-”

“Not against this thing.” I reached in my shirt and pulled out my pentacle. “I’ve worked with spirits before, most are harmless but this bug is malevolent. It’s time for me to crack the Raid out.”

“Are you sure you know what you’re doing?”

“I have no clue, but I’d rather improvise a plan and risk getting out of here alive than giving up. You have faith, you’ll need it. Hang on to it, it’ll be the one thing that grounds yourself against it.”

From my experiences in ghost hunting and research, malignant spirits fed on those with little direction or sense of self. That’s why faith banished them, it was you calling in on your higher self, hell, even an atheist could banish it if they had enough belief in themselves and the solid world around them, just replace “may the power of Christ compel you with , ‘you won’t ruin my reality’.” For me it was “I reject your reality and substitute it with my own!” bad choice of works in fact checking or politics, but golden in fighting malevolent spirits.

I held my breath as I crept along the edge of the office wall, the creature flitting through the shadows, just out of my sight. The coward was avoiding me, perhaps escape was going to be easy. Jarvis was standing at the corner, his gun pointed and his eyes scanning the area. A dark inky shadow slipped away, the hum growing louder as the office went from pitch black to a sickly yellow light.

“Jarvis?”

He turned around, his gun trained on me, I raised my hands in submission.

“Erika! I told you and Rob to remain in place!”

“I know.”

Jarvis lowered his gun and took a deep breath. “What the hell is going on?”

“This is going to sound a little woo woo, but what we’re not up against a human intruder-”

“I’m gonna tell you something, this place was always a bit off, especially at night. But I didn’t say nothing, as long as the bills were paid. So what if the lights occasionally flickered or the computers froze, that’s normal night shit, right? Tell me why they hired a security guard when they need a motherfucking exorcist or some shit?”

“I am an exorcist. Well, at least I am for my coven.”

“You can fight this thing? You saw what it did to Ralph?”

“ The worst thing you can do right now is panic and feed this thing energy. That’s why I need you to calm down.”

Jarvis stared at me blankly, I my reflection gleamed in his dark eyes, and behind me a shadow crept. I rushed to his other side and the being skittered away. 

“It’s afraid of me,” I said.

Rob slowly walked from around the corner. 

“All right. Everyone is accounted for, treat it like an active shooter drill. We need ot reach the door,” I said.

The lights flickered off and we ran towards the exit door at the end of the office, only to find it locked.

Jarvis grabbed my hand and I grabbed Robs as we made it toward the other door only to find that it was also locked. 

“Oh come on! Out of every trope possible!” I punched the door with my hand only to yelp and shake the pain out of my knuckles.

“So what do we do now?” asked Rob. His eyes pleading for help.

“The only thing I can do, fight it.”

We ran down to the break room, the lights flashed on and off before we got there. I led them through the door slamming it behind me. I found the salt shakers and salt packets and poured out a rough circle. Dizzyness hit me like a wave and the pressure dropped so fast that both of my ears popped. Shadows formed into a long spindly creature, like it was shoved together out of old coat hangers and ink. It reached through the door and cried when it hit the salt. 

Rob clutched his cross pendent as Jarvis aimed his gun.

“Don’t shoot, it won’t do any good. Rob keep praying.” I grabbed a handful of salt packets. “I’m going , if I don’t come back, call Mark and tell him that I love him.” I handed Jarvis my phone, my husband’s contact information on the front page.

“You can’t lay that on me, let me go with you.” Jarvis aimed toward the window, awaiting the creature to return.

“I need you to stay with Rob.” I opened the door and walked out into the office. The lights returned to a sickly yellow and the screams became more distant. Whatever this thing was, it didn’t want to deal with me. It wanted the men and I prayed to Gaia that the salt was enough to repel it.

The creature screamed , it clicked like nails on a chalkboard. I tried each of the doors, all of them locked. The hallway seemed like a maze of doorways and florescent lights. I tried each door, jiggling each handle to no avail. Until I reached the stairway at the end of the hall, that doorway opened with little problem.

The sky ungulated with purple and blue swirls though the windows. Another wave of dizziness hit me as I climbed the stairs toward the top floor. The spindly creature crouched at the stairway, leaning like a praying mantis, it’s eyes peering at me . It screeched again and leapt up to the top floor.

I chased after it, the lights flickering on behind me as I chased it. I honestly had no idea what I would do if I caught up to it. A salt packet certainly wasn’t going to kill it and I had no weapon. I regretted not listening to Jarvis. 

I went to the empty breakroom by roof in our building. I rummaged through all the cabinets but all I found was a plastic spoon and a couple of trays. 

Lightning flashed revealing the monster couched in praying mantis form, a portal swirling behind it. Perhaps that was were it came from, why it chose to attack an office in night shift was beyond me. 

I walked out onto the roof and the wind started to blow. The creature lunged for me but I ducked back. I threw some salt in its direction and it shrieked at me. I felt the ground beneath my feet. I was going to go on vacations, this creature was not going to ruin it for me. 

Two gunshots fired and the creature screamed. Jarvis stood in the doorway his gun in perfect aim with the creature. 

“I told you not to come in here!”

“Ericka, I need you to stay back-”

“It’s non corporeal-”

Jarvis began to float in the air, the creature taking control of his body.. 

“I am the daughter of Gia, the Daughter of the Hecate and Morrigan!” 

The creature shrieked and Jarvis dropped to the ground. Rob followed confidently behind him, holding the cross out in front of him. 

“Down into the ground and among the roots, out of our leaves and shoots. Leave as all be, you have no power over me!” I chanted.

The swirling clouds overhead were pierced by bright sunlight. The creature leapt at Jarvis but Rob and I stood in it’s way, forming a wall between it and the security guard.

Full sunlight hit the creature and it screamed one last time before turning into a pile of dust beneath our feet. And we both fell, exhausted in the morning sun.

I walked into back into the breakroom to find all the lights back on in their pale, florescent glory. The doors once again opened and I followed the stairs down. Ralph’s lifeless body lie on the first floor. But it was no longer mangled, but still and cold. Jarvis called 911 and soon sirens sounded in the background.

“You saved my life,” said Jarvis. “You both did.”

“What do we tell the police when they show up?” asked Rob.

“That there was a power outage and Ralph had a medical emergency. That’s what the coverup will be.” I sighed.

“How did you know what to do?” 

“It’s a long story.”

Long story indeed. I managed to defeat this creature easily, but who sent it? The beast wasn’t intelligent enough to come up with it’s own plan. Someone set it on us, and I sat thinking of everyone I could have offended. A customer would have no idea who I was outside of work, so that idea was out. Perhaps it had nothing to do with me, and it was some lover’s quarrel or someone upset and wanting vengeance on their boss. 

To cover my bases I took a salt shaker and sprinkled them around the building. I thought of a steel wall covering the office building. I hoped it was enough of a ward to last until I returned to work next week.” I would stay for a few more hours and answer questions from the authorities. My work had better pay me overtime for this. 

My vacation couldn’t come fast enough, I wanted to go hiking on a mountain pass far from phones and civilization. You best believe Mark was driving me out there after the night I’ve had.

They’re all really good friends with each other and everyone is always telling stories to eachother and joking around. At first everyone was very welcoming. They would ask me questions about myself and start with me. I think I have a pretty fun personality but for some reason, I havn’t been able to have the ‘fun’ part come out during work. Now, they don’t make much convo with me and they’re always having side convos and grabbing coffee/lunch together and they never ask me to join. They’re not necessarily doing anything wrong but I just feel so left out since everyone there are besties and I feel so alone. I can’t help but feel like it might be my fault since they did but in a decent effort at first so maybe I’m just not interesting to them? I don’t know, but it’s taking a toll on my mental health and affecting my everyday happiness. I’ve never felt so unimportant in my life. It actually affects me so bad that I stalked their last intern to see how their interactions were.

1gvj6s5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1gvj6s5/advice_on_dealing_with_a_bpd_smear_campaign/,advice on dealing with a bpd smear campaign,"hello everyone, I am looking for advice and support in coping with an ex friend with bpd who has been seemingly hell bent on ruining my reputation for the last few months. I’m not much of a reddit poster but discovering this group has been so so validating of my experience and hurt. 

i met this girl during my first year of law school. the first time we hung out we spent HOURS together. she was warm, engaging, and so complimentary of me. she told me that she’d never clicked with someone so fast and was obsessed with me, etc. she’s a little younger and kept relaying that she was “so excited to be friends with someone so cool/pretty/popular/fun” — I felt very older-sisterly toward her and matched her energy, inviting her to spend time with my friends and talking with her often. looking back, the signs were there - she would remember and bring up offhanded comments I’d make as if I’d meant them as jabs/insults (ex. i said i didnt love a kind of food I’d had studying abroad and she would refer to it as if I’d trashed her family since her grandfather was from that country?). but I had no experience with bpd and thought that if I made her feel reassured and seen that she would relax and assume best intentions, as we all do with friends. 

the friendship became quite intense and codependent after a few months. I was dealing with a bit of drama with another girl while simultaneously struggling with my relationship (yikes I know I sound like the problem but I promise I am not a habitual drama queen/shit talker!) and she really poured herself into the situation, constantly asking me about it with deep probing questions. she would get so upset over peoples’ behavior toward me that she would sob even though I was never ever that upset. she would then spiral about how she’s too emotional and cares too much and is afraid I will drop her as a friend. she began needing constant validation and reassurance that I loved her “as much as she loved me” and that I wouldn’t ditch her, while also encouraging me to cut off all of my other friends who she perceived as “moving funny” and end my relationship. i began to walk on eggshells because she would take things too far - for example, I expressed my low libido and she said that was like sexual assault?? she would call me her soulmate and best friend despite only knowing her a few months and would get very upset if I didn’t text quickly enough, couldn’t come over, or did something that made her feel like we were “different” (for example, I enjoy drinking and am fairly extroverted while she does not drink, she would say it devastated her if I went out because “we’re just too different)

I have so many examples but the friendship became taxing. she also began mentioning how she had cut off practically every close friend she had ever had and that she preferred passive aggression and assuming the worst to communicating. this raised some red flags. several incidents happened where I would say or text something innocuous (to me!) and she would respond days later with long essays about how hurt it had made her feel. i would PROFUSELY apologize (even when I thought it was ridiculous) and she would eventually swap over to “omg im so crazy just ditch me already”

i think the split (if im learning the term right) came in july based on a few things. i decided to get back together with my boyfriend and she just completely flipped a switch. she would interrogate me about it and send passive aggressive texts, dredging up old stuff. i asked her if she was trying to convey something with the passive aggression (in hindsight, i wish I hadn’t been so direct) because she had specifically talked to me many times about doing so and she freaked, saying that it was incredibly fucked up to ask that and jt hurt that i would think so low of her and that she didnt actually give a fuck about my relationship and needed a boundary and never wanted to hear about it again. she wouldn’t respond for several days while i apologized and tried to diffuse. when we eventually talked i tried to get her, gently, to understand my perspective and she refused to validate my feelings while demanding that i validate hers. it was so overwhelming and frustrating that it made me cry and i feel like that did something in her mind. around the same time, i went to the beach with my longtime best friend and she told me she was sick with jealousy, felt she had to compete for the “top spot”, and felt like we had probably shit talked her the whole time. 

upon returning to school, i knew something was wrong. she wouldn’t text baxk unless she needed something for a class, blew off every invite to talk or get coffee, and was cold and distant. our last text exchange involved me asking repeatedly if we could talk becayse i wanted clarity on what was wrong and she kept saying she was too busy even though we’d have class together. it was painfully awkward to be around mutual friends but she ultimately ghosted me. i stopped trying to ask her to speak and just tried to proceed as normal, being kind and civil to her (while feeling hurt by the loss of a friend, though it felt like a relief). she has phased into being openly hateful to me: glaring in the halls, refusing to speak to or look at me, loudly whispering to her friends when I pass. it’s laughably middle school but has really been wearing on me, as it’s been three months of this behavior. most frustratingly, she has turned obsessively to the mutual friends who she was constantly calling “mean girls” and encouraging me to drop. i never involved them because law school is tough, nobody has time for petty bullshit and i believe that conflicts should stay between the two parties. i hoped that they would try to check in with me or initiate separate hangouts. but it seems that they’ve bought into the clear smear campaign that she is running against me (and now my two closest friends who also witnessed a lot of her behavior - she has similarly cut them off completely with no notice). 

i apologize for the trauma dump - i just don’t know what to do. school is a toxic environment as it is and I go to a relatively small school. I’ve done my best to keep my head up and haven’t said a peep about her or any of it to anyone besides my two very close friends, but it feels like being the bigger person is allowing her to isolate me from my social circle. it blows my mind how she managed to infiltrate my friend group and ice me out, i just never saw it coming. I’m genuinely afraid of what she might say or do to further damage my personal or professional life so I’ve tried to just avoid her and act normal, but it doesn’t seem like she is losing steam. i tell myself that karma will come around, my real friends would have had my back, etc - but it sucks, and it’s hard not to internalize feelings of shame and guilt and wondering if I’m the problem/the narcissist when many treat you as such. is there anything I can do to make her stop? would you recommend trying to speak to my former mutual friends or will that fuel the fire? any coping mechanisms would be much appreciated. thank you! <3",2,1732083514.0,BPDlovedones,0,1.0,False
1gvj6am,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gvj6am,Lava Craze Owner,3 months ago nag feedback ako sakanila sa TikTok saying na “ Real na po ba yung Mango?” Kase nag post sila na real mango yung nillagay sa Mango craze nila.

They're a great way to meet new people and they provide a safe platform for musicians to perform.

For reference, an open mic night is a live music event where performers take turns playing short sets (normally like 3 or 4 songs). They're normally hosted in bars, pubs or coffee shops.",5,1732083452.0,Uzbekistan,2,1.0,False
