You try reporting threats? Crickets.
Send them documented fraud? Silence.
Perjury, setups, false arrests? They’ll sip their coffee and pretend it’s not their problem.

But here’s the truth they don’t wanna face: every ignored plea, every dismissed affidavit, every citizen they let drown while the guilty walk free—they’re not just neglecting justice… they’re fueling resentment.

That’s how extremists are born.
Not from ideology, but from betrayal.
Not from hate, but from being unheard, again and again.

The FBI sits back while real victims are crushed under lies and weaponized systems. But when one of those victims finally breaks? Suddenly, they act surprised.

They didn’t stop the fire—they stacked the wood and handed out matches.

This isn’t a threat.
It’s a wake-up call.

If you’re new to the Pacific Northwest or planning a trip here, you might already have Mount Rainier, Pike Place Market, or a coffee crawl on your itinerary. But here’s a little local secret: a Fishing Charter Seattle experience might just be the highlight you didn’t know you needed. Puget Sound, with its incredible mix of scenery, fish species, and salty adventure, is hands-down one of the most underrated fishing destinations in the entire country.

# Not Just a Body of Water—It’s an Angler's Playground

Puget Sound is a sprawling saltwater estuary that wraps around Seattle and stretches north past Edmonds, WA. It’s not only rich in marine life, but it also offers stunning surroundings: evergreen-draped cliffs, snow-capped mountains, and a skyline that includes both skyscrapers and bald eagles. The best part? You can be on the water reeling in your first catch within an hour of landing at Sea-Tac Airport.

# Home to Legendary Salmon Runs

You’ve heard of Alaska's salmon, sure. But Puget Sound is home to its own legendary runs. Booking a Salmon Fishing Charter in Seattle or Edmonds puts you in prime waters for Chinook, Coho, Pink, and Chum salmon throughout the year. If you're lucky enough to visit during an odd-numbered year, the Pink salmon run is downright electric.

# More Than Just Salmon

While salmon get the headlines, Puget Sound also offers rich bottom fishing for lingcod, halibut, and rockfish. There's even the occasional octopus sighting. For anglers who love variety, the Sound delivers in spades. And yes, that 40-pound halibut you heard about? Totally real.

# Underrated = Uncrowded

Unlike more hyped destinations, Puget Sound fishing charters don’t come with long waits, oversold boats, or elbow-to-elbow casting. It’s the sweet spot between wild nature and accessibility. You get that peaceful, authentic fishing vibe while still being close to all the creature comforts of Seattle.

# Great for Newbies and Pros Alike

Whether you’re a seasoned angler or holding a rod for the first time, the captains at Puget Sound Sports Fishing are there to guide you every step of the way. They supply top-tier gear, local knowledge, and pro tips to make your trip easy, fun, and fish-filled.

# A Perfect Add-On to Any Vacation

Let’s be honest—after a few days of city life or hiking, nothing hits quite like a morning on the water. Add a fishing charter to your Seattle vacation, and suddenly your trip has a highlight story you’ll be telling for years. (And maybe even a salmon dinner you caught yourself!)

# Don’t Miss Out

Still on the fence? Trust us—this is one of those ""why didn’t I do this sooner?"" experiences. A Fishing Charter Seattle outing is your ticket to discovering why locals love this water and why Puget Sound deserves way more national fishing fame.

On my birthday, my husband left me and posted a sweet photo with his assistant on Instagram. 

In the photo, she was holding a test tube while Joseph lowered his head to record the data. 

The caption read: “He said, ‘With me by your side, the journey of research won’t feel lonely.” 

I didn’t let myself spiral with questions this time. I simply left a comment: “You two look perfect together.” 

My phone buzzed just as I swallowed the last bite of cake. 

Joseph’s voice came through, tired and low. “Don’t overthink this… Next time, on your birthday…” 

“That won’t be necessary,” I interrupted him. 

Joseph Crawford, there won’t be a next timè for us. 

申車 

That night, I spent six hours baking a cake, and waiting for Joseph to come home. 

But when he arrived, he didn’t even glance at me. He said without looking back, “I need to work late, go ahead and eat.” 

I stayed quict and ate the entire cake by myself 

Around midnight, a photo popped up on my Instagram showing Joseph and his female assistant in the laboratory. 

In the photo, she was holding a test tube while Joseph lowered his head to record the data. 

The glass window showed the faint reflection of the two standing close together. 

The caption under the post said, “He promised I wouldn’t be alone. chasing scientific research.” 

I didn’t question him, only wrote in the comment, “You two suit each other.” 

I was finishing the last mouthful of cake when my phone buzzed. 

Joseph’s voice sounded tired, “Don’t overthink this… Next time, on your birthday…” 

“Forget it,” I interrupted him. 

I gazed out at the rain falling softly outside. “I understand, research is important.” 

But Joseph, there won’t be a next time for us. 

\*\*\* 

When Joseph walked in, rain was still falling outside. 

Usually, I’d wait by the door with a dry towel, but this time I stayed on the sofa flipping through a magazine. 

“Why didn’t you come to pick me up?” His hair dripped with water, 

leaving dark, circular stains on the wooden floor. 

Without looking up, I turned a page and said, “I’m busy.” 

Taking off his damp coat, he quietly asked, “Warm up some milk for me.” 

Before, I would’ve hurried to bring him a hot drink. 

But now, I simply held my own cup. 

“If you want it, get it yourself.” 

Suddenly, he reached for my wrist. “Is this because of your birthday….” 

I withdrew my hand, and the ceramic cup gently tapped the coffee table. 

He rubbed his temples and said, “The project is now at a crucial stage. Emerson Lynch, I really don’t have the energy to deal with you right 

now…” 

“I know scientific research is important,” I cut him off. 

Raindrops struck the window, echoing the rainy night from last year. 

I was walking down the hospital corridor when I overheard him reassuring Hailey Paxton, “No matter what happens, I’m here for you. Don’t be scared.” 

I signed the consent form for the appendectomy surgery by myself. 

Joseph’s gaze moved across my face several times before he let out a tired sigh. 

“Emerson, do you really have to make me suffer like this?” 

I met his stare without flinching and replied, “You’re overthinking it.” 

The silence stretched on. 

He suddenly took a velvet box out of his briefcase and dropped it onto the coffee table. “Here, happy birthday.” 

Inside the box was a necklace, its pendant slightly askew, as though it had been carelessly tossed inside. 

It looked utterly out of place next to the neatly wrapped Van Cleef & Arpels gift Hailey had posted for her birthday. 

“Thanks.” I closed the box, my voice as calm as if I were talking about the weather. 

Joseph stood up abruptly. “That’s it?” 

He held out his hands, “Where’s my present?” 

“Oh, I completely forgot.” I grabbed my phone, “I’ll transfer it to your PayPal. You can buy it yourself.” 

He looked at me as if he had been struck by a bolt of lightning. 

After all, we’ve made it a tradition to exchange gifts every year, no matter whose birthday it is. 

I’ve been sticking to this for years. 

Just like in the past five years, even when he forgot my birthday, I’d always send him a carefully chosen gift right at midnight. Last year, he missed my birthday because of a work trip, and I flew to his city to 

surprise him. 

Once I sent the money, I stood up, changed into my clothes, slipped on my high heels, and got ready to leave. 

Joseph stopped me, clearly annoyed. “It’s late, and it’s raining heavily. Where do you think you’re going?” 

I said, putting on my coat, “Joseph, do you want to know what’s the funniest thing?” 

He stared at me, confused. 

I opened the door and continued, “You always said I was too controlling. Now that I’m not interfering, you’re even angrier and trying to control me.” 

With that, I closed the door, ignoring Joseph’s yelling. 

The night breeze rushed in, bringing with it a long–missed feeling of freedom. 

Since I started dating Joseph, I turned down all evening gatherings because he mentioned he didn’t like me coming home too late. 

As a result, my colleagues and friends started thinking I was a killjoy. 

They understood that my husband was strict, so they stopped inviting me to any gatherings after that. 

Now, I can finally reconnect with the friends I’d pushed away all these years and enjoy the nightlife with them. 



Chapter 2 

Inside a loud bar. 

My best friend tapped me on the shoulder and teased with a grin, “I really thought you were settling down as the perfect wife forever!” 

I tilted my head back and downed the drink in one shot, laughing, “Haha, then make sure you invite me to the next party you throw.” 

Ever since **I** got together with Joseph, my world had shrunk so much that he was basically all I had left. 

The parties I skipped, the hobbies I let go of, the friends I drifted away from. 

This book **had** been added on your bookshelf. 

Looking back now, it’s almost laughable. 

My phone lit up, and the notification for the refunded transfer stood out sharply. 

By the time I reached home, it was already two in the morning. 

When I unlocked the door, I spotted Joseph in the dim room, a glowing, cigarette between his fingers. 

For a second, I felt confused, almost doubting what I saw. 

“Oh, you still remember to come back?” 

He stubbed out the cigarette and got to his feet, wrinkling his nose at the smell of liquor. “Have you been drinking? Why pretend not to care? If you’re jealous, just admit it.” 

Leaning on the doorway, I let out a soft laugh. 

Out of nowhere, a memory popped up. Three years ago, when he came home late from work, I stayed up all night only to hear, “Why are you. so clingy?” 

My head spun as I collapsed into the chair by the dining table, my hands trembling. 

Joseph sniffed slightly, and his eyes flickered with irritation. “You know how much I can’t stand the smell of alcohol.” 

He switched on the lamp. “Besides, there’s nothing going on between Hailey and me. Why are you doing this to yourself?” 

Holding my face in my hands, I laughed quietly. “I was in a good. mood, so I had a couple more drinks.” 

His gaze locked onto my glazed eyes, fists tightening, “Did you really have to go out drinking just to upset me? I don’t have time for this. Emerson, you’re a married woman, can you act like one?” 

I gave a half–hearted nod. 

He suddenly raised his voice, “Get serious! I don’t have endless patience! Don’t assume I’ll always try to smooth things over!” 

My head pounded, the hangover headache only making it worse. 

I waved dismissively. “Think what you want, I’m exhausted.” 

Joseph suddenly slammed the glass on the table, and the sharp crack of it breaking filled the quiet room. “It’s always the same! Every time we fight, you act like you don’t care. Do you ever think about how I feel?” 

Cheute: 1. 

I bent down carefully to avoid the shattered glass on the ground, my lower back bumping into the table edge without a sound. 

He reached out as if to grab my arm, but I quickly stepped away. 

As soon as I locked the bedroom door, I heard his footsteps pacing quickly outside. 

That night, I curled up on the edge of the bed, listening to his occasional sighs drifting in from the living room, and I didn’t sleep at 

all. 

Not until the morning sunlight slowly slipped through the gaps in the 

curtains. 

When I opened the door, I saw Joseph slouched on the sofa, his face cold and his eyes shadowed. 

I moved past him to grab my car keys, and as I closed the door behind me, I heard a glass crash loudly against the wall.

When people think of epic fishing adventures, Alaska gets all the glory. But here’s the thing: you don’t have to hop on a plane and spend a small fortune to have a world-class fishing experience. In fact, a **Fishing Charter Seattle** offers jaw-dropping views, trophy salmon, and salty stories without the layovers and heavy travel bills.

# Home Waters, Big Fish

Seattle's backyard—the Puget Sound—is bursting with salmon runs, halibut, and bottom fish. We’re talking Chinook, Coho, and Pink salmon galore. A **Salmon Fishing Charter** out of Edmonds or Seattle gives you access to these fish-rich waters just minutes from the dock. No floatplanes required.

# Less Travel, More Fishing

One of the best parts of fishing in the Seattle area? You’re fishing within 30-60 minutes of leaving the city. Compare that to a full travel day to Alaska, and it’s not even close. Less time traveling means more time reeling, relaxing, and reveling in the moment.

# All the Scenery, None of the Frostbite

Sure, Alaska is beautiful. But Puget Sound holds its own: snow-capped mountains, emerald islands, and marine wildlife including whales and eagles. You get the wilderness feel, but you're also within reach of hot coffee and a craft beer when you dock.

# Budget-Friendly Adventure

Let’s be real: Alaska fishing trips can be pricey. Flights, lodges, remote guides—it adds up. A Seattle charter delivers the same bucket-list fish (and stories) without draining your savings account.

# The Local Flavor

From the seafood joints on the Seattle waterfront to the charming marina at Edmonds, WA, a local charter is more than just fishing. It's about experiencing the heart of the Pacific Northwest, complete with fresh crab rolls and cozy post-fishing taverns.

I confronted him about it and he said he prefers calling and his adhd makes him a bad texter. I am not comfortable calling him yet since I don’t know him as well but I still text him. We meet up for a second date for dinner and kiss goodbye, date went fine. He texted me after saying he had a great time. We text over the next few days and at least some point he took 3-4 days to get back to me over text. Having been ghosted in the past, I took it as a sign that he’s not interested, so I sent him a text that basically said that I need someone who can provide me with clear and consistent communication and that I enjoyed my time with him, but if he can’t do that, then maybe it’s best we don’t continue romantically. He responded and apologized and understood said that he was looking forward to getting to know me and wanted to meet again. I say ok and ask him when he has time to meet. He sent me his busy schedule and said he might have time on Friday. I tell him I can meet anytime on the weekend except for Friday night, which is when he wanted to meet. He claimed he had no other availability due to his work, and said next Wednesday might work. I was a bit frustrated but I just told him to let me know. Anyway, we continue kinda texting a bit throughout the days, we also play GamePigeon. He texted me today and asked how I was. Sorry for the long winded story, but I am not very experienced in dating and I can’t tell what he wants. To me it seems like he is avoiding meeting up, but when I gave him the chance to leave, he didn’t want to. My therapist thinks I should meet him again and that he might be on the spectrum. I don’t really know if I should continue trying or if I should give up on this. Some pointers would be extremely helpful! Thanks",1,1748411796.0,AskMenRelationships,0,1.0,False

**Here’s why quality matters:**

- **Taste:** Superior chocolate brings a deeper flavor.

## Understanding Texture

Achieving that perfect cookie texture is an art. The Ghirardelli Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe teaches us that getting it right is all about the balance of dry and wet ingredients. 

**Here are some pro tips:**

- **Mixing Technique:** Don’t over-mix once you add the flour. This helps keep those cookies tender.
- **Chill Time:** Giving the dough some time to chill in the fridge can enhance flavors and improve texture. 
- **Egg Temperature:** Use room temperature eggs for a smoother batter.

Embrace these tips to elevate your cookie-making venture!

## The Cultural History of Chocolate Chip Cookies

Did you know that the beloved chocolate chip cookie has an interesting backstory? The Ghirardelli Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe ties into this rich history by using one of the most celebrated chocolate brands in America.

The first chocolate chip cookie was created in the 1930s by Ruth Wakefield at the Toll House Inn. She was trying to make a new dessert by adding broken chocolate pieces to her cookie dough. Little did she know, this sweet invention would become a staple in American households!

Just like Ruth's innovative approach, the Ghirardelli Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe embodies the spirit of creativity and quality that has been cherished for decades.

## Secrets to Baking the Perfect Cookie 

Let’s unwrap the keys to mastering the Ghirardelli Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe. Each secret unveiled can lead you closer to that ideal cookie.

### Pick the Right Tools

Having the right equipment helps streamline your baking process:

- **Mixing Bowls:** Use glass or stainless steel for durability.
- **Baking Sheets:** Opt for quality cookie sheets to promote even baking.

### Trust Your Senses

Baking is as much about feeling as it is about following a recipe. 

- **Smell:** Trust the aroma; when your cookies are nearly baked, your kitchen will smell heavenly.

- **Feel:** When you touch them, they should feel slightly firm but soft in the center.

- **Spices:** A dash of cinnamon can provide a warm twist to traditional chocolate chip cookies.
- **Chocoholic's Dream:** Swap some chocolate chips for chunks for varied texture.

Baking is about personalization, and your unique twist will make your cookies even more special.

## Serve with Love

Once your cookies are baked to perfection, serve them up warm, and watch the smiles appear!

- **Pairing Ideas:** Serve with a cold glass of milk, coffee, or even ice cream for the ultimate dessert experience.
- **Gifting:** These cookies make a wonderful gift! Package them beautifully and share the love with friends and family.

Nothing fancy, just food, tunes, and some really lovely presents  all gift cards and some smaller cash from family members to get me established post-grad.

My 19year-old cousin Bella, halfway through the party, she starts going through the stack of cards/presents I already opened earlier and  said, ""You don't mind if I grab a few of these, do you? I mean, you're done with school. I've got two more years!"" 

I laughed because I thought she was kidding but she wasn't.

She started pocketing  $25 Starbucks gift card and a Target gift card, giving the following reason to justify it: ""You don't even drink coffee, and I NEED school clothes. Plus, you're getting a job now, so it's basically fair.""

I told her to drop everything she collected right there, and stop it. She runs to her mom (my aunt), and tells her that I am being ""stingy"" and ""killing the party vibe."".

Rather than telling her to apologize, my aunt SHRUGS and responds, ""Well, maybe you could share. She's just excited."" My mom immediately ask Bella not to come close to those gift again.

And then there are people who just get it. They ask questions nobody else thought to ask. They fix things quietly at 2am without making a scene. They read between the lines, take initiative, and make everyone better.

1kx9fpr,https://www.reddit.com/r/PortlandOR/comments/1kx9fpr/portland_puss/,Portland Puss,"I’ve been in Oregon for two and a half months now. Long enough, I think, to form a judgment. And here’s mine: there’s something strange going on with the people here. I call it the Portland Puss—that tight-lipped, eyes-averted, socially allergic look I keep getting.

I live in a house with neighbors I’ve seen a few times, but they seem to do everything possible to avoid interaction. I walk outside, they duck back in. One leaned into her car and pretended to rummage for something rather than say “hello.” Another saw my little dog—who is objectively adorable and usually a magnet for attention—and retreated into her house like we were radioactive.

This isn’t normal. I’ve lived in a lot of places and I’ve never felt this wall of… what? Shyness? Discomfort? Passive-aggressive frostbite?

Downtown Lake Oswego is different—people there actually smile and make eye contact—but maybe it’s because they’re not locals. I’ve read about this kind of behavior before. The “Seattle Freeze” they call it up north. But it’s not just Seattle. It’s here too. The Pacific Northwest Freeze, maybe.

I’m not angry about it. I’m not even sad. I’m just stunned. Flabbergasted. Bewildered. At 63, I didn’t think I’d feel like I was back in kindergarten trying to make friends on the playground.

But here’s the thing—I’m not giving up. Call it Irish stubbornness. Just last week, I struck up a chat with the cashier at Whole Foods. She’d just moved here from California too. We hit it off and made a date for coffee next Tuesday at 1 p.m. That’s something. That’s a start.

Thank God for my daughter, my built-in friend. And thank God I’m not the type to let cold shoulders keep me cold for long. I’ll keep smiling. Keep trying. Because I believe people can surprise you… once they decide to come out of hiding.",11,1748411070.0,PortlandOR,68,0.57,False

I (28 F) am working multiple jobs to be able to pay my bills and am in the process of a fiancee visa so money is very tight and I don't feel right nor think its a good idea to get a full time job as I can't commit at least a full year as once I get my visa im going asap as I want to get married to my fiance. 

Due to the multiple jobs, I have a job which requires me to work from 8.30am to 6pm. I decided to use up my 2 off days to put in shifts for this coffee place as well as put down potential shifts from 7pm until the closing time at 10.30pm. I like working at this coffee place which is why i dont mind working 7 days a week. 

I could honestly let go of the coffee job as the other jobs have finally brought me to financial stability where I can actually buy food for myself, the coffee job is not capable of paying me enough to reach that kind of financial stability and I have tried it and mathed it out before. 

I told my manager to only put me down for the 7pm shifts IF there is no one else to do closing with the other closing person. Usually we have 2 people doing opening and 2 doing closing. However, due to their schedules and lack of manpower, it can be hard to get enough people, which is why I put that down to the manager so I can help out. 

The other coworkers however, are upset as they didn't like the fact that someone will be alone from 4pm-7pm so they take it upon themselves to stay until I reach the store. 

I have since then gotten the heat from them saying that I should just quit the job, that im making things hard for them for asking for 7pm shifts. I'm appaled. If I hadn't put down those shifts, other people would either have to do a full shift or that person would be closing alone. 

I had a huge fight with the other coworker here and now I'm feeling petty a f. 

WIBTA if I go through with my plan of not putting down any 7pm shifts and let them just handle it on their own? I'm asking because I WANT to be an asshole cause im done helping them ",3,1748411010.0,AmItheAsshole,5,1.0,False

""Freya, Mr. Whitemore signed off on your resignation papers, but he didn't notice it was you leaving. Want me to let him know?"" The HR director's voice came through the phone, concern evident.  
  
Freya's eyes lowered as she replied softly, ""No need. Just leave it as is.""  
  
""But you've been his right hand for four years! He values you more than anyone and totally depends on you. Are you absolutely sure about quitting?""  
  
HR was practically begging, but Freya just offered a small smile.  
  
""Nobody's irreplaceable in this world. My parents aren't doing well, and I need to head back home to settle down. Since Mr. Whitemore approved it, I'll handle the transition. I'll be gone in a month. Thanks for checking.""  
  
After hanging up, Freya went back to sorting through her things. She'd lived in this penthouse for three years. Not too much stuff, not too little—just keeping essentials and tossing the rest.  
  
As the room emptied, she felt momentarily disoriented, memories washing over her like waves.  
  
Eight years ago, Freya—a small-town girl from a modest family—got into Harvard and became best friends with New York heiress Elena Whitemore.  
  
Despite their completely different backgrounds, they clicked instantly—attending lectures together, grabbing lunch, hitting the shops—practically joined at the hip every day.  
  
Gradually, Elena brought Freya into her world, introduced her to family, and unwittingly, Freya fell hard for Elena's brother, Jasper. But she buried those feelings deep, never breathing a word to anyone.  
  
After graduation, Elena took off to study in Paris. Freya stayed in New York, landed a job as Jasper's assistant—all to be near him.  
  
Then came that night when someone slipped something into Jasper's drink. Freya was about to call 911 when he pinned her against the wall, his control gone as his mouth claimed hers.  
  
After a night together, she woke to find him by the window, his sharp profile haloed in cigarette smoke, brooding and distant.  
  
Hearing her stir, he turned. ""You're into me, aren't you?""  
  
Freya instinctively wanted to deny it, but he continued, his face expressionless.  
  
""You blush whenever I walk in. You know all my likes and dislikes. You jumped at becoming my assistant right after graduation...""  
  
""Don't tell me that's all coincidence.""  
  
His words left her face burning, from embarrassment or guilt, she wasn't sure which.  
  
In the heavy silence, he suddenly handed her a card.  
  
""Last night shouldn't have happened. I'm in love with someone else and can't return your feelings or take responsibility. Elena mentioned you come from a modest background—there's enough money on this card to set you up for life. Let's both forget this ever happened.""  
  
Freya was stunned. Then she remembered he'd repeatedly called out a name in bed: Mia. Mia Carter.  
  
From Elena, Freya knew Mia was Jasper's unforgettable first love. He was so hung up on her that even after she dumped him and moved abroad, collecting a string of rumored boyfriends, he insisted on waiting for her return.  
  
Freya recalled Elena's eye-roll: ""The Whitemores are known for being cold fish. How did my brother turn into such a hopeless romantic? Waiting all these years, saying everyone else would be 'settling' because he refuses to settle.""  
  
Feeling this in her bones, Freya suddenly found her courage and called after Jasper as he headed for the door.  
  
""I don't want your money. I just want a chance. Please, just try being with me. If she never comes back or... if she does return but you still can't move on, I'll walk away. I promise.""  
  
Faced with her lovesick gaze, Jasper paused for a beat before muttering, ""Whatever,"" and walking out.  
  
From that day forward, Freya was his assistant by day and his lover by night. They left their mark in his office, his Maybach, against the windows of his penthouse. Four years passed with no one knowing about their arrangement, and she told herself she was happy.  
  
Until his birthday a few days ago. Freya had planned several surprises to celebrate. But as midnight approached, instead of Jasper, she got a notification from his social media—an account he'd never used before.  
  
""Best birthday gift? Getting back what I lost.""  
  
The forever-silent Jasper Whitemore had posted a photo of himself kissing Mia Carter beneath exploding fireworks.  
  
Seeing this, the blood drained from Freya's face, her chest tightening. With one last desperate hope, she called him.  
  
Mia answered. After saying ""hello"" several times to silence, she called out: ""Jasper, who's this Freya Kingsley calling you and not saying anything?""  
  
A moment later, his deep, cool voice came through the speaker: ""Nobody important. Ignore it. Come back to bed, babe.""  
  
In that moment, Freya knew her exit cue had arrived.  
  
She packed her things, ready to leave, when she ran into Jasper at the door. Since they'd been sleeping together regularly, Freya had been staying at his place for convenience—but now, she couldn't stay another night.  
  
Seeing her with her bags, his eyes narrowed slightly, but he made no move to stop her. ""Found a place?""  
  
""Yeah, my old apartment. Talked to the landlord—just for a month.""  
  
At this, Jasper frowned. ""A month? What for?""  
  
Freya started to explain, but he seemed to lose interest, merely saying, ""I'll drive you.""  
  
She tried to refuse, but he insisted.  
  
""It's dumping snow out there, and it's late. If anything happened to you, Elena would kill me.""  
  
Freya reluctantly got into his car. Once, they'd been intimate countless times in this vehicle, but now she barely recognized it. The interior was plastered with cute plushies, Hello Kitty seat covers, and snacks everywhere...  
  
She could hardly imagine this serious, standoffish man transforming his car into something so cutesy.  
  
Noticing her stare, Jasper offered a brief explanation: ""Mia's into this stuff.""  
  
Freya got his meaning and stayed quiet for a long while before responding softly.  
  
""You finally got her back. I'm happy for you, Mr. Whitemore.""  
  
Jasper hadn't expected that response. His eyes darkened, and he said nothing more.  
  
Halfway to her place, Mia called, wanting to build a snowman with him. He pulled over, clearly eager to go to her, but hesitated when he glanced at Freya.  
  
Understanding his dilemma, Freya opened the door. ""I'll grab a Uber from here, Mr. Whitemore.""  
  
He nodded and got out to help with her stuff. Her hands slipped, and the box crashed to the ground. As he bent down, the streetlight illuminated its spilled contents, freezing him in place.  
  
Love letters addressed to him but never sent, candid photos she'd secretly taken, things he'd tossed that she'd rescued and treasured...  
  
Freya's heart hammered as she scrambled to gather everything.  
  
""Sorry about that.""  
  
Without a word, Jasper got back in his car and sped away.  
  
Freya waited in the snow for ages but couldn't get a ride. Trying to lug her box home, she was hit by an electric scooter.  
  
The collision left a nasty gash on her calf, blood staining the snow. Watching the hit-and-run driver disappear, she gasped with pain, lying in the snow for what felt like forever.  
  
When she could finally move, she limped through the snow for four hours before reaching her apartment.  
  
After patching up her wound, she checked her phone to find a message from Jasper, sent after he'd left:  
  
\[Stop being so obsessed with one guy. There are plenty of fish in the sea. Don't hang all your hopes on me.\]  
  
Freya stared at this message for a very long time.  
  
At dawn, she went downstairs, set fire to the box, and burned everything inside it. The love that had burned fiercely in her heart for eight years turned to ashes alongside those mementos.  
  
Jasper Whitemore, I'll grant your wish.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
After a quiet weekend, Monday morning rolled around, and Freya arrived at work on schedule.  
  
She handled her usual tasks, including notifying Jasper about his upcoming meeting. Approaching his office, she glanced through the partially open door and stopped cold.  
  
Mia was sitting in Jasper's lap, feeding him the other half of her cookie. The famously germaphobic CEO actually ate it with a smile, then gently kissed her fingertips.  
  
""You were talking about craving these yesterday, so I stood in line for three hours this morning. Worth it?"" His voice had a tenderness Freya had never heard before.  
  
""Mmm, they're perfect—sweet but not sickeningly so. You used to trek across town for these all the time. Now you're literally running a corporation. Can't you just send someone to get them?"" Mia wiggled her foot as he massaged her ankle.  
  
The look on Jasper's face was pure devotion. ""Anything that matters to you, I handle myself. Always.""  
  
Mia's face lit up as she wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him. He pulled her closer, completely lost in the moment.  
  
Watching them, Freya felt like she'd been punched in the chest, a bitter ache spreading through her. Her fingernails dug deep into her palms, leaving bloody crescents behind.  
  
As the meeting time approached, Freya composed herself and knocked lightly.  
  
""Mr. Whitemore, your meeting's about to start.""  
  
Hearing her, Jasper tensed slightly and started to rise, but Mia tugged him back down.  
  
""Don't go yet. Five more minutes?"" She gave him puppy-dog eyes.  
  
Her playful plea melted his resolve instantly.  
  
""Push the meeting back two hours,"" he called out.  
  
This meeting involved a collaboration between major New York corporations that was crucial to the company's future. Freya knew its importance and couldn't help adding:  
  
""The CEOs from Verdean, Aurex, and Vireon are already in the conference room...""  
  
""God, Jasper, your assistant is such a buzzkill! Can't she take a hint?"" Mia rolled her eyes dramatically.  
  
Jasper's expression hardened instantly. ""I said postpone it two hours. Nothing comes before Mia, got it?""  
  
Freya felt like she couldn't breathe. In the end, she simply closed the door and walked away.  
  
Everyone in their circle knew Jasper was a workaholic machine. No matter what was happening personally—even right after surgery—he'd drag himself in to finish his work.  
  
Yet here he was, risking relationships with major partners because of a little whining. This was completely new territory.  
  
Did he really love Mia that much?  
  
Freya pulled herself together and walked into the conference room to face the waiting executives.  
  
The Whitemore empire was powerful enough that these CEOs, despite being pissed, wouldn't directly criticize Jasper. Instead, they unloaded on Freya.  
  
She took their verbal abuse silently, head down.  
  
After an excruciating two-hour wait, Jasper finally showed up. As Freya left the conference room on legs that felt like jelly, Mia called out to her.  
  
""You're Freya, right? Jasper says you make killer coffee. Everyone looks dead on their feet—whip up some for the whole floor? Mine with ice, no sugar.""  
  
Knowing her place in the hierarchy, Freya headed to the break room without protest.  
  
Two hours later, she finished preparing over four hundred cups, delivering them one by one.  
  
After just one sip, Mia's face darkened. She hurled her mug straight at Freya's head.  
  
The ceramic smashed against Freya's forehead, opening a nasty gash. She let out a gasp of pain and dropped to the floor, clutching her wound.  
  
Not satisfied, Mia grabbed more mugs and kept throwing them.  
  
Bruises bloomed across Freya's body as ceramic shards sliced her skin. Coffee soaked through her clothes, mixing with bright red blood dripping onto the floor.  
  
Despite the blinding pain, she could only curl into a ball, protecting her head and chest.  
  
The office went dead silent. Nobody dared step in as Mia continued her meltdown. They all kept their distance, watching in horror.  
  
The commotion brought Jasper out of his office. He surveyed the chaos and Freya's crumpled form with narrowed eyes.  
  
""What the hell happened?""  
  
Seeing him, Mia instantly switched to victim mode. ""Jasper, I asked her to make me coffee. I'm on my period, and she deliberately put ice in it. My cramps are killing me now.""  
  
Seeing her teary eyes, Jasper's face darkened immediately.  
  
""You've worked for me for four years and can't handle a simple coffee order? Or do you have some problem with Mia?""  
  
Freya raised her deathly pale face to explain, but he didn't give her the chance. He called over another assistant.  
  
""Dock her entire month's salary and quarterly bonus. Send a company-wide notice and have her make a public apology at next week's all-hands.""  
  
With that, Jasper draped his jacket over Mia's shoulders and led her away.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
As Jasper vanished down the corridor, the tears Freya had been fighting finally broke free.  
  
She forced herself up, wincing as she grabbed a broom and mop to tackle the mess of shattered ceramic and coffee.  
  
A few sympathetic coworkers came to help, their eyes full of pity.  
  
""I clearly heard her say 'with ice, no sugar.' How's she flipping this on you? Did you tick her off somehow?"" one whispered.  
  
""Like she needs a reason?"" another muttered. ""Everyone knows she's a total princess. Throws a fit over nothing. Half our circle can't stand her, but with Jasper in her pocket, nobody dares say boo.""  
  
""Man, I've never seen him this crazy about anyone. Freya, just watch your back. We're regular folks—we can't compete with trust fund babies. With Jasper backing her play, we just have to eat whatever crap they serve us.""  
  
Freya appreciated their support, but their words left her emotionally tangled.  
  
Once, when a client tried blaming her for their own mistake on a contract, Jasper had stood rock-solid behind her. He'd believed in her completely, fighting until her name was cleared.  
  
But now? Mia drops one casual lie, and he doesn't even fact-check or let her explain. He just assumes she's at fault.  
  
After years of dedication, handling countless fires for him—didn't she deserve that basic trust?  
  
Or in his world, did right and wrong not matter as long as Mia was happy?  
  
The thought left her heart feeling like raw hamburger.  
  
It took forever to clean everything before dragging her battered body home.  
  
She had barely stepped out of the shower when her phone lit up with Jasper's name.  
  
""Bring over some Advil and heating pads.""  
  
She threw everything together ASAP and headed to his penthouse.  
  
In just days, the once sleek space had transformed completely. The cherry tree his grandfather planted—gone, replaced by tulips. The black and white furniture he'd always preferred—swapped for pink and yellow pieces he used to mock. Display cases now showcased jewelry, designer bags, and gifts...  
  
Pure Mia, through and through.  
  
Freya took it all in silently before knocking on the bedroom door.  
  
Jasper opened it, grabbed the stuff, and finally glanced at her face.  
  
With the coffee cleaned off, her injuries looked brutal, making him pause.  
  
""Jesus. Have you had that checked out?""  
  
Freya just shook her head.  
  
He rubbed his temple, his tone softening slightly.  
  
""Look, Mia was just feeling like garbage. She wasn't gunning for you specifically, so don't take it personally. I'll add what I docked from your pay to your Christmas bonus. Get those wounds looked at—if they're bad, take a few sick days. I'll sign off on it, no red tape.""  
  
""That won't be necessary. At the end of this month—""  
  
Freya tried telling him about her resignation, but he cut her off, shoving a card into her hand.  
  
""Just do what I'm telling you. I need you to put together a welcome-back thing for Mia, so rest up and heal.""  
  
The words died in Freya's throat.  
  
She nodded, took the card, and turned to leave.  
  
As the door swung shut, she caught Mia's voice:  
  
""Babe, is that tea ready? Can you come rub my stomach?""  
  
""Coming right now. Just lie still and don't move, okay?""  
  
Hearing his tender tone, Freya smiled bitterly.  
  
Her own cramps were brutal too—she'd actually passed out at work multiple times and been rushed to the ER.  
  
When he found out? Just a signed time-off form. No visits, no tea, no heating pads.  
  
Back then, she'd told herself he was swamped with work.  
  
Now she got it—he just didn't give a damn.  
  
After leaving, Freya hit up urgent care for basic treatment.  
  
She crashed at home for a few days before getting bombarded with party specs from his assistant.  
  
Everything from floral arrangements to dessert selections to server uniforms came with ridiculous requirements.  
  
With just three days to pull it off, Freya pushed through her exhaustion to make it happen.  
  
After running herself ragged, the party kicked off at 7 PM sharp.  
  
Mia floated in wearing some couture masterpiece, immediately becoming the room's center of gravity.  
  
Guests swarmed her with compliments, feeding her ego.  
  
""It's been ages, but you're still that same knockout, Mia. Even a 'casual' welcome-back party looks like the Met Gala—clearly Jasper's still completely whipped!""  
  
""Remember college when some poor schmuck asked Mia out? Jasper literally got the guy transferred! He shredded love letters on sight, and when people talked smack about Mia, he put those dudes in the hospital!""  
  
""Everyone knows Mia's his kryptonite—the one he can't resist! Look at that ice she's wearing—gotta be worth a couple million! And that dress is one-of-a-kind. Jasper's always been 'price is no object' when it comes to keeping Mia happy!""

But still, don't you feel the food standards could be improved here?

I am not talking about the appreciation of the cuisine itself (Malay or Chinese or whatever), which is more an affair of personal taste. 

And I am not talking about the quality of the local produce (vegetables, fruits, poultry, etc ) which is quite good in my opinion. 

No, I am referring to the way the food is prepared and served in regular restaurants. For example, fries which are sent already cold and worn out in several fast food joints. Huge food buffets in 4 and 5 stars hotels but most of the food is almost inedible. Completely dried out croissants and pastries in coffees. Generally over sweet and oily food, sometimes not very fresh or clean. 

If you agree, what could be the reason for that?

Of course, if you go to Japan, you will find that the food is good virtually everywhere, even Starbucks or 711 taste better than most fancy places here. But now even Thailand is catching up, they have improved a lot in the past 10-20 years.

I wanted to share some of my favorite healthy habits and rituals that have made a real difference in my life, and hear about yours too. These are small but powerful routines that keep me grounded, healthy, and mentally clear. Feel free to add yours in the comments—I'm always looking for inspiration!

🧘‍♂️ **Morning Movement (Even Just 5 Minutes)**  
Stretching, yoga, or a quick walk outside first thing in the morning resets my mind and body. It doesn’t have to be intense—just moving wakes me up better than coffee sometimes.

🍋 **Warm Lemon Water Before Coffee**  
This simple switch helps with digestion and hydration. Plus, it feels like a mini ritual to start the day mindfully.

📵 **One Hour Phone-Free Before Bed**  
Game changer. Better sleep, less anxiety, and more time to read, journal, or just breathe.

🧠 **10-Minute Brain Dump Journaling**  
I do this whenever my thoughts feel chaotic. Just unload everything in my head onto paper—no structure, no pressure. Instant clarity.

🌱 **Daily Nature Breaks**  
Even if it’s just 10 minutes sitting outside or a walk around the block, getting sunlight and fresh air is non-negotiable now.

🥗 **One Nourishing Meal a Day (Minimum)**  
I don’t stress over every single meal, but I commit to at least one plate of real, whole food every day—usually lunch or dinner. It helps me feel more balanced.",5,1748410534.0,Life,2,1.0,False

A few months ago he randomly ran into me at my work, we made eye contact, and then a week later he adds me on Instagram and asks me out for coffee. I’m getting my masters and he’s in his undergrad, so we are both busy people. We met up for coffee and it was a great time in person, despite his dry texting. I confronted him about it and he said he prefers calling and his adhd makes him a bad texter. I am not comfortable calling him yet since I don’t know him as well but I still text him. We meet up for a second date for dinner and kiss goodbye, date went fine. He texted me after saying he had a great time. We text over the next few days and at least some point he took 3-4 to get back to me over text. Having been ghosted in the past, I took it as a sign that he’s not interested, so I sent him a text that basically said that I need someone who can provide me with clear and consistent communication and that I enjoyed my time with him, but if he can’t do that, then maybe it’s best we don’t continue romantically. He responded and apologized and understood said that he was looking forward to getting to know me and wanted to meet again. I say ok and ask him when he has time to meet. He sent me his busy schedule and said he might have time on Friday. I tell him I can meet anytime on the weekend except for Friday night, which is when he wanted to meet. He claimed he had no other availability due to his work, and said next Wednesday might work. I was a bit frustrated but I just told him to let me know. Anyway, we continue kinda texting a bit throughout the days, we also play GamePigeon. He texted me today and asked how I was. Sorry for the long winded story, but I am not very experienced in dating and I can’t tell what he wants. To me it seems like he is avoiding meeting up, but when I gave him the chance to leave, he didn’t want to. My therapist thinks I should meet him again and that he might be on the spectrum.

1kx95cf,https://www.reddit.com/r/FATTravel/comments/1kx95cf/japan_tokyokyoto_hotel_reviews/,Japan (Tokyo/Kyoto) hotel reviews,"My husband and I returned from a 15 day trip to Tokyo/Kyoto, here’s everywhere we stayed and some random takeaways: 

  
**Hoshinoya Tokyo** 

Mostly agree with the reddit consensus on this place: neat and worth trying if you’re willing to forego some 5\* service elements. Mainly, they do not have a concierge, so if you only want to eat at known places, you have to plan in advance to have things booked separately. 

You have to remove your shoes on the ground floor, but this was not nearly as big of a hassle as expected. While you get your shoes on, they call for a taxi and by the time you get to the taxi level, the driver already knows your destination which is to be expected but still nice to have.  

For everything we needed, service was seamless, though we didn’t really ask for much. Loved their bath products/hair dryer, it dried my hair faster than a Dyson lol. Same products are upstairs in the onsen locker area. The rooftop onsens are segregated by gender, which should’ve been obvious but I didn’t realize this when I first booked the hotel. They were let us go at a private hour (at the end of the daily cleaning window) but they still wouldn't let us use one together. 

Japanese breakfast was delicious but funkier than other Japanese breakfasts we had on the trip. You must order the day before (by 8pm I believe) and by the time we ordered in the afternoon, the only available slots were 7:15 and then 8:45. Not sure if those are the set times or if the slots in between were already taken. 

Each floor has a communal area which was nice to have, a super serene place to get some work done if you do that. They had coffee/tea/a small selection of snacks but all sweets nothing savory. I think every morning they had someone there serving special coffee or tea (like blue bottle pour-over vibe) which was nice. 

Apparently they are very strict on only allowing hotel guests inside.. as in if you’re with a friend who is not a guest they will absolutely not be allowed to enter your room even if you’re just running up for a minute to grab something.. this didn’t affect me but I’d be mad about this tbh 

Overall, would recommend for a couple nights if you’re intrigued/if visiting a true ryokan in the trip isn’t an option. Probably wouldn’t return to this exact location but would possibly consider others. 

  
**Janu Tokyo**

I'd heard mixed reviews so I had low expectations going in, but overall we were totally pleased with our stay (especially after staying at the Aman later on). 

Leading up to the trip, the concierge was hit or miss. They booked L'Effervescence for prime time on a Saturday night before the reservations technically opened up, but then failed to help with getting sumo tickets which I didn’t think would be difficult.. Luckily we weren’t set on going and just wanted the tickets in case we changed our minds. Even in the times they weren't helpful materially, they were very responsive.

They automatically upgraded our room at check in and provided really good strawberries and Ruinart in the room which was nice. There were plenty of staff available at all times, we never felt like we needed anything or were waiting around for someone. 

Similar to the concierge the service was a bit hit or miss. Shortly after check in, we wanted to run out to a store in the complex and a staff member guided us from the lobby down to where we needed to be. To be fair it wasn't super far but the hotel is in a big development and we didn't have our bearings yet so it felt super helpful in the moment! 

Biggest hiccup was with arranging a luggage transfer, which is shocking because I feel like it’s so common in Japan! Long story short they failed to communicate the correct drop-off time, notified us of this while we were out to lunch, and said if we couldn’t have the bags ready in 30 minutes it may not arrive until two days later than expected. As a solution they offered an expedited service that’s $700 USD (mind you, the standard service was less than a tenth of that). I was super confused because I’d heard that most standard services deliver next day, sometimes even same day for that distance. When we got back to the hotel in the afternoon we were just like, something’s a bit off about this.. Then they quickly offered to have a staff member take our bags to the courier themselves so it could arrive on time via the standard service. So it worked out, but this was the only (minor) headache of the whole trip.

The gym was the best hotel gym I've ever seen by a long shot. They provide running shoes (ons) and gym clothes if needed which I thought was neat (though in hindsight other hotels did this too so maybe it’s more common than I realized). I thought I'd be grossed out at borrowing shoes but the hotel and facilities were so clean that I honestly would've. Sauna/pool areas were all nice and clean as expected, and the sauna was super hot in a good way. The only weird thing is they make you wear a cap if you want to go in the pool, but I got over that. 

Janu is in the same complex as teamlab borderless so if you even might want to go and you’re staying here, I’d just book the earliest slot (9am) for one of the days. We did it on the day of our checkout and it was a great choice logistically. 

  
**Aman Tokyo**

If you get anything out of this review, please let it be that some people (myself included) don’t think this hotel is worth the hype. Obviously a city hotel with a lot of rooms is totally different from a smaller property where you don’t leave, so we didn’t have crazy high expectations going in. It genuinely just didn’t meet our expectations for a “top tier” hotel. Most things were literally just fine, anything I’m noting was memorably above/below average. 

Leading up to the trip (and while we were there) the concierge was extremely helpful. Got us every reservation we asked for before they opened up, including Jiro the original branch (loved - working on a food review as well)! And when we noted our food preferences, they sent it to the Janu to make sure they had it too. The concierge was noticeably better than all the other hotels, like I remember thinking we’ll probably leave Japan as Aman junkies lol. 

They picked us up from Tokyo Station (we were coming in from Kyoto) and a staff member was waiting for us at the platform with a sign. They had a driver idling the car as close as you could possibly be, so it was a super pleasant experience. This was probably the only time we felt like we got exemplary service. The talk of the staff knowing your name/room, not having to press elevator buttons, etc., all untrue lol, in these regards we got better treatment at almost every other hotel we’ve stayed at in recent memory. 

Check-in was literally fine, like the same as any other decent hotel tbh. When we were brought up to our room, they spent a ton of time explaining things that weren’t necessary but also didn’t give any information that was particularly useful, like when we should book spa treatments if we’re interested. They upgraded us to a Signature Grand Suite, but didn’t mention it until we asked how many of the rooms are the same setup. I was surprised to find that it was one of their higher suites since it didn’t feel THAT special.. but we were very grateful for the upgrade nonetheless. 

The room was missing things that I would’ve expected it to have, like a bigger mini fridge or cutlery. But then it had a dishwasher.. A million cabinets but no additional blankets or pillows or towels. I know you can obviously ask for anything additional, it’s just a bit odd what they chose to include vs. not lol. At one point I wanted to cut the tags off of things we bought and when we asked for scissors they said they weren’t allowed to give us scissors, but they could have someone do it for us.. we were like uh ok.. and after \~15 minutes they didn’t come so we called again and in the end they just brought some up for us to use on our own lol.

Housekeeping was considerably lacking. Wet robes/towels/used toiletries not replaced. At one point a used cleaning rag was left on the toilet when we got back to our room, just unpleasant. Zero personalized touches, just the bare minimum of making the bed/lowering the curtains at turndown. Nice touches I remember from other hotels: remembering the temperature you like it to be overnight and adjusting the thermostat for turndown, placing a nice bookmark where you have a page folded, cleaning your glasses, noticing you finished one of the snacks/drinks and refreshing extra of that specific thing next time, etc.). 

The pool area was uncomfortably hot, and honestly looked nicer in pictures than IRL. Janu pool area was bigger and more enjoyable to use, even if it looks less impressive architecturally. Same thing with the gym, it looked dated and had fewer ameneties compared to the Janu. 

Breakfast was extremely mid, I can’t even remember what we got but I do remember that they served browned avocado slices one morning. It was so mid that I didn’t want to have any other meal at the hotel for the rest of our stay. At afternoon tea, they had one person serving the entire room and he was definitely overwhelmed, didn’t come by once after the main items were brought out. 

Overall, we were totally underwhelmed by the service, which is so sad because it was actually our first Aman stay. Again, we weren’t expecting to be blown away, I guess just confused as to how it’s viewed so favorably when there are so many other great options in Tokyo. My only thought is maybe we would’ve gotten more attention if we booked through a travel agent, but we paid in cash for not the lowest tier room so not sure how likely that is. And honestly even if you book the lowest tier, at 3k a night every guest should be treated exceptionally imo. If anyone had a similar experience I’d love to hear so I don’t feel so crazy for thinking it was just meh. 

  
**Hotel Seiryu Kyoto**

Honestly really highly recommend this place if you want to stay in one of the main touristy areas of Kyoto. We did get upgraded to the top suite (we’re randomly in the top 1% spend/loyalty status for Leading Hotels of the World) so I guess that could’ve impacted our experience. 

Every staff member was totally competent and almost over the top helpful, like the type of service you’d expect at a hotel that’s priced much higher. Most people know your name/room. If you ask if they can recommend an x place for lunch and they’ll give you a couple options pointing out key point for each place, make the res, remember to specify any preferences without you reminding them, and arrange a taxi or tell you how to walk there. It doesn’t sound crazy when I write it out like this but I feel like flawless service is honestly rare. 

They have cool programming. Each day for an hour or so in the afternoon there’s either a tea ceremony, some Japanese music I can’t recall the name of, or a Maiko performance. It’s perfect because it happens at like 3 or 4pm, so after being out for the morning/afternoon it gives you something chill to do besides rot until dinner. This takes place in the guest lounge, where they have (good) light bites and drinks, and everything including all the alcohol and Acqua Panna/Pellegrino is complementary! Borderline confused about how they can offer all this sustainably. 

The breakfast was great, you pick a dish a la carte (with Japanese breakfast as an option) but also there’s a full buffet. Glass bottled Italian water flowing just like in the lounge lol which I loved because it drives me mad when water is free in one area of the hotel but not in another. Coming from people who spend like $100/day on water when we travel I know this is irrational but I’d rather it be fully not free than free sometimes but not other times. 

This hotel is on the bigger side (the building used to be an elementary school) so it didn’t feel as private as other smaller hotels, but not to the point where it ever feels crowded at breakfast/in elevators, etc. Another random thing is they have private baths you can book but FYI they are not onsens, just normal baths. Didn’t try these so can’t speak to them.  

Overall this hotel felt like a great value which is a rare and nice feeling even if you don’t need it to be. If we ever wanted to stay in one of the dense parts of Kyoto again (which tbh we prob wouldn’t) we’d stay here again!

  
**Fufu Kyoto**

Compared to all of the other hotels we stayed at, I think this place was the most under the radar. We wanted a “ryokan” in Kyoto close enough to the super dense areas but with an in room onsen. I was weirdly struggling to find something that fit the bill so we ended up settling on this one even though it didn’t seem as luxurious as what we would’ve ideally wanted. 

Our room (one of the lower tier rooms) was way more spacious than I expected, like we could open up four suitcases if we wanted to no problem. There’s an iPad where you can order any typical thing you could get at a hotel and then some, and it magically gets delivered into this little door within minutes (dumbwaiter vibe). I loved this and it’s smart considering guests are frequently undressed to take advantage of the in room onsen. 

We’d consider staying here again despite its quirks just for the in-room onsen. We used it multiple times a day and I’m convinced I need one in my house. The water is set to the perfect temperature but you can request hotter or colder if you’d like. I’m a bit of a germaphobe so I was worried it might not be 100% clean but it felt like it was, moreso than the one at Hoshinoya. I was also worried it would feel humid/gross in the room but it was totally fine, no issues. 

We did opt in to have breakfast/dinner at the hotel for the two nights we stayed there, and they change it up so that you don’t eat the same thing each day. I can’t recall exactly but the price increase to have food included was nominal. The food was very good, I would’ve been happy if I was served the same meals at a standalone restaurant. Meals are served in private rooms or in a private counter (not sure how to describe it) looking out at the garden. Very romantic and pretty both in the morning and evening! 

Just an FYI, this was the only hotel where most of the staff didn’t speak English, including the “concierge.” Luckily we didn’t need much from them but the service was clunkier/notably worse than what we’ve gotten used to. For example when we had to ship our luggage, they asked a million questions and had us sit there while they measured the luggage, called the receiving hotel, etc., which felt really unnecessary. There was also a mishap where they tried to charge us for an activity we didn’t sign up for and the language barrier made it difficult to resolve. 

Not sure if this is true always or just while we were there but it felt like we were the only non-Japanese people staying at the hotel which was pretty cool. Everywhere else it was mostly tourists (obviously) but I got the vibe that this place was where Japanese people staycation. In hindsight I think we had a hard time booking this with Amex/US credit cards and ended up going through a third party to book, so maybe that’s part of it. 

It might not be as fat as other hotels we’ve stayed at but I’d totally recommend it for a couple of nights if you’re looking to just unwind while still being in a convenient location. If it’s not your first time in Kyoto (or if you don’t care about proximity to the main areas) there are likely other more luxurious options, just farther out where you mostly remain on site. 

One thing I noticed consistently at each hotel was there seemed to be no young people around.. Like the next youngest people seemed to be in their late thirties or maybe even forties, which didn't really matter to us but just surprised me! Anyway, hope this is helpful, happy to answer any questions :)",5,1748410030.0,FATTravel,3,1.0,False

I’ve been on many ferries all over the world, from WSF to the outer islands of Scotland and Ireland. 

Nothing has *ever* been as nice as the BC Ferries. 

It loads two decks with different ramps at the same time for a total of 310ish vehicles (WSF’s max is 210) in half the time. It’s nearly as big as a cruise ship and almost as nice inside - a reasonably-priced gift shop, two cafes, a kids’ area, pet areas, two indoor passenger decks and two outdoor decks with stunning views of the straits and islands. Many comfortable chairs in various configurations, and a lounge playing Canadian news. 

I made off with two nice locally-made coffee mugs, a greeting card, and an armload of British sweets for under $40 metric. Each terminal had a mini-mall with numerous (open) businesses including cafes, restaurants, and merch. (I mourn the death of Commuter Comforts at the Seattle terminal). Due to ongoing political events, I noted that most cafe menus had been updated with cardstock and sharpie to replace “Americano” with “Canadiano” on the available list of espresso drinks.

You might think such a large vessel would be be excruciatingly slow, but no - watching this goddamn building-sized ship yeet itself through narrow straits and marine traffic at flank speed was one of the highlights of the trip. I’ve never been much of a Vehicle Person, but fuck, I might become one trying to figure out how even strong differential thrust could make this thing move in the uncanny way that it does. It corners like a Mario Kart and fucking drifts around shoals and rocks like a cartoon. Again, imagine a cruise ship that maneuvers like a jet boat. 

In any event, if you end up having to take the BC Ferries for a trip north, they’re not half bad. Make a reservation tho.",34,1748409938.0,Seattle,13,0.93,False
1kx945p,https://youtu.be/MIBh4BI76n8,5 Very Scary TRUE Horror Stories Compilation,"**""The USB Drive That Ruined My Peace"":**

I never thought a late-night scroll could turn my life upside down. It was just another evening, my laptop glowing in the dark as I sipped coffee, diving into a forum about local secrets and conspiracies. I’ve always been the curious type, the kind who can’t let a mystery go. That night, a thread about GreenTech Industries, a big company in my town, grabbed me. The post claimed they were dumping toxic waste into the river that supplied our water. People were getting sick, fish were dying, and the company was supposedly covering it all up. I couldn’t shake it. I had to know more.I started with a basic search, typing “GreenTech Industries pollution” into my browser. The results were all fluff—articles about their “innovative solar panels” and “community grants.” Their website was a glossy showcase of smiling employees planting trees and shaking hands with local leaders. Their social media? Picture-perfect, with posts about charity runs and green tech awards. It felt staged, like a mask hiding something ugly. I wasn’t convinced.I dug deeper, pulling up public records on a government database. My eyes burned from staring at the screen, but I found a report from six years ago. GreenTech had been fined for “minor safety violations” at one of their plants. Nothing about toxic waste, though. It was too small, too clean. Companies like that don’t get caught unless they’re careless, I thought. Maybe they’d gotten better at hiding things.I joined an environmental group on a social media platform, a small one with locals who cared about the river. I posted a vague question: “Anyone heard rumors about GreenTech polluting?” Most replies were shrugs or rants about other companies, but then a private message popped up from someone called “ShadowLeaf22.” Their profile was bare, just a default avatar. “I worked at GreenTech,” they wrote. “Saw them dump chemicals in the river. I have proof, but I’m scared. You want it?” My pulse quickened. This was it—a real lead.We messaged back and forth. ShadowLeaf22 was nervous, saying they’d been fired after asking too many questions. “They watch people,” they wrote. “Be careful.” They promised to send evidence if I swore to keep their name out of it. I agreed, my fingers trembling as I typed. A few days later, I found a plain USB drive in my mailbox, no note, no return address. My apartment felt too quiet as I plugged it in. The screen lit up with files: grainy photos of workers in hazmat suits tipping barrels into the river at night, timestamps showing dates from the past year. There were emails too, internal ones between managers, joking about “cheaper disposal methods” and “keeping regulators off our backs.” One line stuck with me: “No one’s looking. We’re safe.” I felt sick.I called my friend Jamie, who works in a law office and knows about environmental cases. “This is huge,” he said over the phone, his voice low like he was afraid someone might hear. “Those emails, those photos—if they’re real, GreenTech’s done. But you’re poking a bear. Companies like this don’t mess around.” I told him I just wanted the truth out. “Then verify it,” he said. “And watch your back.”I spent days cross-checking the files. The photos had metadata—dates, locations near the river. I found a map online and matched the spot to a secluded bend where GreenTech had a facility. The emails mentioned real names, people listed on the company’s website as executives. It all lined up. I decided to write a blog post, laying out the evidence with the photos and emails, but keeping ShadowLeaf22 anonymous. I hesitated before hitting publish, my cursor hovering over the button. What if Jamie was right? What if this was too big? But I thought of the river, the people drinking tainted water. I clicked.The post exploded. Shares, comments, angry emojis—it spread like wildfire. By morning, a local news site had picked it up, quoting my blog. Strangers messaged me, thanking me for exposing GreenTech. I felt a rush, like I was finally making a difference. But that night, an email landed in my inbox. No sender name, just a string of random characters. “You’re digging where you shouldn’t. Stop now.” My stomach twisted. Just a troll, I told myself. The internet’s full of them.Then more came. “We know your address.” “Your family’s not safe.” Each one was worse, more specific. One mentioned the coffee shop I went to every morning. Another described my bike, the red one I rode to work. I started sleeping with the lights on, checking my windows obsessively. I showed Jamie the messages at his place, my hands shaking as I scrolled through them. “This is bad,” he said, leaning back in his chair. “You need to go to the police. Now.” I argued it wasn’t enough for cops—anonymous emails, no hard proof. “You’re being stubborn,” he snapped. “This isn’t a game. People get hurt over stuff like this.”I didn’t listen. I kept digging, desperate to find more. I searched for whistleblowers tied to GreenTech and found an old article, buried deep in a news archive. A former employee, someone who’d tried to report illegal dumping, had disappeared before their court date. The story was vague—no body, no answers, just a photo of a nervous-looking man in his 30s. My chest tightened. Was that what waited for me?The harassment got worse. My email was hacked, my password changed overnight. I got locked out of my social media for hours. My phone rang at 2 a.m., blocked numbers with nothing but heavy breathing when I picked up. One night, walking home from work, I heard a car engine idling behind me. A black sedan with tinted windows crept along the street. I quickened my pace, my heart hammering. When I glanced back, it sped off, tires screeching. The next morning, I found a note taped to my apartment door, written in sharp, blocky letters: “Last chance to walk away.” I stood there, frozen, the paper shaking in my hand.I messaged ShadowLeaf22, begging for help, advice, anything. But their account was gone, deleted without a trace. Panic set in. I was alone, and whoever was watching me knew it. The emails grew uglier, mentioning my sister, Claire, and her job at the library. “Claire works late Tuesdays, doesn’t she?” one said. I called her, my voice shaking. “Lock your doors,” I told her. “Don’t ask why, just do it.” She sounded confused but promised she would.I couldn’t eat, couldn’t sleep. Every noise outside—a car door, a dog barking—made me jump. Then came the knock. It was late, past 11 p.m., and my apartment was dark except for the flicker of my laptop. I crept to the door, heart in my throat, and peeked through the peephole. A man stood there, mid-40s, in a crisp suit, his face calm but his eyes like ice. “Open the door,” he said, his voice steady, like he was ordering coffee. “We need to talk about your little blog.”“Who are you?” I managed, my voice barely a whisper.“GreenTech Industries. You know why I’m here.”I gripped my phone, my thumb hovering over 911. “I took the post down,” I lied, trying to buy time.He didn’t blink. “That’s not enough. You’ve got files, evidence. Delete them. All of them. Or things get worse.”“Worse how?” I asked, my mouth dry.“Your sister, Claire. She’s nice. Works at the library, right? Be a shame if something happened.” He said it so casually, like he was discussing the news.I felt like I couldn’t breathe. “I’ll do it,” I said. “I’ll delete everything. Just leave us alone.”“Prove it,” he said. “Destroy the USB, the files, all of it. Post a retraction online, say you made it up. Do it by tomorrow, or we’ll know.” He slid an envelope under the door and walked away, his footsteps echoing in the hall.I opened it with trembling hands. Inside was a single sheet of paper with instructions: delete all evidence, post a public apology, never speak of GreenTech again. I sat on my couch, staring at the USB on my coffee table, its tiny silver body holding the truth. I thought of the whistleblower, the one who vanished. Was this how it started for him?I didn’t sleep that night. My mind raced, replaying every threat, every detail. I wanted to give up, to make it stop, but something in me wouldn’t let go. GreenTech was poisoning people, and they were getting away with it. I couldn’t just walk away.The next morning, I called Emma, a journalist I’d met at a community event. She’d written about local corruption before, tough stories that got people talking. We met at a diner, tucked in a corner booth. I told her everything—the USB, ShadowLeaf22, the emails, the man at my door. My voice shook as I handed her a copy of the files. “This is insane,” she said, scrolling through the photos on her laptop. “If this is real, it’s huge. But you’re in danger. You sure you want to keep going?”“I don’t know,” I admitted, stirring my coffee. “But if I stop, they win. The river’s still poisoned. People are still sick.”She nodded, her face serious. “I’ve got contacts—cops, regulators. I can get you protection while I dig into this. But it’ll take time. Can you hold on?”I nodded, though I wasn’t sure I could. Emma worked fast, verifying the files with experts, tracking down other whistleblowers who’d been silenced. She got me a police detail, a patrol car that parked outside my apartment at night. It helped, but not much. Every shadow felt like a threat.Weeks later, Emma’s outlet published the story. It was everywhere—TV, radio, social media. “GreenTech Exposed: Toxic Dumping and Threats to Silence Critics,” the headline read. Protests erupted outside their headquarters. Regulators raided their facilities, finding barrels of chemicals hidden in a warehouse. Three executives were arrested, charged with environmental crimes and witness intimidation. The river cleanup started soon after.I should’ve felt safe, but I didn’t. Even with the arrests, the fear lingered. I kept my curtains drawn, checked my locks three times a night. One evening, my phone buzzed with a new email. No sender, just one line: “You think this is over? We’re still here.”I don’t know if it was GreenTech, a leftover lackey, or just someone messing with me. But I feel it every day—the eyes I can’t see, the steps behind me I can’t hear. I wanted the truth, and I got it. I helped stop them. But I also learned that some rabbit holes don’t let you climb out. Not completely. Every creak in my apartment, every stranger who lingers too long, reminds me: they’re still watching.

  


**""What Slenderman Took"":**

I was twelve, sprawled on my bedroom floor with a bowl of popcorn between my knees, the faint glow of my nightlight casting shadows on the walls. Morgan and Anissa, my best friends since we were little, were over for a sleepover. We’d spent years sharing secrets, laughing over dumb jokes, and sneaking extra cookies from my kitchen. But the last few months, things had changed. They’d started talking about this thing—Slenderman. Some creepy figure from the internet, tall, faceless, with long arms that didn’t look human. At first, I thought it was just a game, like when we’d tell ghost stories with flashlights under our chins. But they weren’t playing.Morgan sat across from me, her dark hair messy, picking at the hem of her hoodie. She hadn’t smiled all night. “Payton, you don’t understand,” she said, her voice low, almost a whisper. “Slenderman’s real. He’s been watching us. I saw him outside my window last week.”I forced a laugh, but it came out shaky. I grabbed a handful of popcorn, the kernels crunching too loud in the quiet room. “Come on, Morgan. It’s just a story. Like, something people made up online. You know that, right?”Anissa was on my bed, scrolling on her phone, her glasses slipping down her nose. She didn’t look up, but her voice cut through the air. “It’s not a story, Payton. We’ve read stuff. Forums, chats, people who’ve seen him. He talks to us. He says we have to do something big to prove we’re loyal.”My stomach twisted, like I’d eaten something bad. They’d been weird for weeks—whispering to each other when they thought I wasn’t listening, showing me creepy drawings of a stick-thin figure in a suit. I didn’t like it, but they were my friends. I didn’t want to lose them. “Guys, let’s talk about something else,” I said, reaching for the remote. “There’s a new movie on. Or we can play a game.”Morgan’s eyes locked on mine, unblinking. “We can’t ignore him. If we don’t do what he wants, he’ll come for our families. Your mom, your little brother. Don’t you care?”I froze, the remote slipping from my hand. It hit the carpet with a soft thud. “What are you talking about?” My voice was small, barely mine. “You’re scaring me.”Anissa pushed her glasses up and sat forward, her phone forgotten. “Tomorrow, we’re going to the park. The woods behind it. He’ll be there. He told us we have to go, and you’re coming with us.”My heart started pounding, loud in my ears. The park was fine during the day—kids on swings, moms pushing strollers—but the woods? They were dark, full of twisted trees and shadows that moved when you weren’t looking. I’d only been in there once, on a dare, and I’d run out after hearing a branch snap. “Can’t we just stay here?” I said, my mouth dry. “My mom’s making pancakes tomorrow. She’ll put chocolate chips in them.”Morgan leaned closer, her hand grabbing my wrist. Her fingers were cold, tight, like she wasn’t letting go. “No, Payton. We’re going. You don’t get to say no.”I yanked my arm back, rubbing where her nails had pressed into my skin. My eyes darted to the door. I wanted to run downstairs, tell my mom everything, but she was probably asleep on the couch, some old sitcom playing on the TV. I felt trapped, like the walls of my room were closing in. “Okay,” I mumbled, my voice barely audible. “I’ll go.”That night, I didn’t sleep. I lay in my sleeping bag, staring at the ceiling, listening to Morgan and Anissa whisper on the other side of the room. Their voices were low, urgent, words like “prove” and “Slenderman” slipping through the dark. I clutched my pillow, my heart racing every time they paused, like they were checking if I was awake. I kept my eyes half-closed, pretending to sleep, but my mind wouldn’t stop spinning. What did they mean, “prove ourselves”? Why did they need me?Morning came too fast. I woke up to Morgan standing over me, her backpack already on. “Get up,” she said, her voice flat. “We’re leaving now.”Anissa was by the door, tying her sneakers, her face blank like she was thinking about something else. I sat up, my body heavy, like I hadn’t slept at all. “Can’t we eat breakfast first?” I asked, hoping to stall. My mom was in the kitchen, clattering pans, the smell of coffee drifting upstairs.“No,” Morgan said, sharper this time. “We’re going now.”I pulled on my jeans and a hoodie, my hands shaking as I tied my sneakers. My mom called up, “You girls heading out? Be back by lunch!” I wanted to scream, to tell her not to let me go, but Morgan was watching me, her eyes like needles. “Yeah, Mom,” I called back, my voice wobbling. “We’re just going to the park.”The walk to the park felt like it took forever. Nobody talked. My sneakers scuffed the sidewalk, the sound too loud in the silence. Morgan walked ahead, her shoulders stiff, like she was on a mission. Anissa stayed close to me, her elbow brushing mine, like she was making sure I wouldn’t run. The park came into view—empty swings, a slide glinting in the light, and beyond it, the woods. A wall of trees, dark and tangled, like they were waiting for us.I stopped at the edge of the grass, my feet refusing to move. “Guys, I don’t want to go in there,” I said, my voice shaking. “Let’s just stay by the swings. Please.”Anissa turned to me, her face hard. “You’re not backing out, Payton. This is for Slenderman. We have to do this.”My throat tightened. “Do what? What are we even doing?”Morgan didn’t answer. She just kept walking, straight into the woods. Anissa grabbed my arm, her fingers digging in, pulling me forward. I stumbled, my sneakers catching on roots, branches scraping my arms. The deeper we went, the darker it got. The trees closed in, their leaves rustling like whispers. My heart was hammering now, my breath coming in short gasps. I kept looking back, hoping to see the park, but it was gone, swallowed by the trees.We stopped in a small clearing, the ground covered in dead leaves and twigs that snapped under my feet. Morgan dropped her backpack and unzipped it, her movements slow, deliberate. My stomach dropped when I saw her pull out a knife. The blade was long, shiny, the kind my dad used to cut vegetables, but in her hand, it looked wrong. Deadly.“What are you doing?” I whispered, my voice breaking. I took a step back, but Anissa was right behind me, her hands clamping onto my shoulders.“It’s okay,” Morgan said, her voice calm, almost soft, like she was talking to a scared animal. “This is what he wants. If we do this, he’ll leave us alone. He’ll keep our families safe.”Tears burned my eyes. I shook my head, my whole body trembling. “Morgan, please. Don’t. We’re friends. You don’t have to do this.”She stepped closer, the knife steady in her hand. Anissa’s grip tightened, her nails biting into my skin. “Just stay still,” Anissa said, her voice cold. “It’ll be over quick.”I screamed, twisting to break free, but Anissa was too strong. My arms flailed, grabbing at air, my sneakers slipping on the leaves. “No! Stop! Please!” I begged, tears streaming down my face. “I don’t want to die!”The first stab hit my side, a sharp, burning pain that stole my breath. I gasped, my knees buckling, but Anissa held me up. Morgan stabbed again, and again, each cut like fire ripping through me. I tried to scream, but my voice was gone, just a choking sound. Blood soaked my hoodie, warm and sticky, pooling on the ground. I lost count of the stabs—ten, fifteen, more. My vision blurred, the trees spinning, Morgan’s face fading in and out.They let me fall. My body hit the dirt, leaves sticking to my cheek. I heard Morgan wipe the knife on her jeans, the sound sharp and final. Anissa whispered, “It’s done. He’ll be happy now.” Their footsteps crunched away, fading into the trees, leaving me alone.I wasn’t dead. I should’ve been, but I wasn’t. The pain was everywhere, my body heavy, like it was sinking into the ground. I clawed at the dirt, my fingers digging into the earth, dragging myself forward. Every move hurt, every breath burned, but I couldn’t stop. I had to get out. I thought of my mom, my little brother, waiting at home. I couldn’t let them win.I don’t know how long I crawled. Minutes, maybe hours. My arms shook, my vision went dark at the edges, but I kept going, inch by inch, over roots and rocks. The woods seemed endless, but then I saw light—a path. I collapsed there, my cheek pressed against the cold ground, blood soaking into the dirt.A man’s voice broke through the haze. “Oh my God, kid! Hold on!” He was a biker, his face blurry as he knelt beside me. He shouted for help, his phone pressed to his ear. Sirens came next, loud and close. Hands lifted me, gentle but urgent, onto a stretcher. Lights flashed, voices overlapped. “Nineteen stab wounds,” someone said later, like it was a fact from a book. Nineteen. I shouldn’t have survived.In the hospital, my mom held my hand, her face wet with tears. I couldn’t talk much, not with the tubes and bandages. The scars are still there—jagged lines across my stomach, my chest, my arms. They itch sometimes, a reminder of that day. Morgan and Anissa were caught, saying Slenderman made them do it, like he was real, like he’d whispered in their ears. They believed in a lie, and it almost killed me.I don’t go to the park anymore. I don’t trust sleepovers, or friends who get too quiet, too strange. The fear never leaves, not really. It’s not about monsters or ghosts—it’s about people. People who can look at you, smile, call you their friend, and then hold a knife to your heart. That’s the kind of horror that stays, the kind that doesn’t need a faceless man to make you afraid.

  


**""Miscount"":**

I stood on the dive boat, my fins heavy, the ocean stretching out endlessly around us. My partner was next to me, adjusting their mask, their eyes bright with excitement. “This is it,” they said, grinning. “The Great Barrier Reef. Can you believe we’re here?”I smiled back, my heart racing. “It’s unreal,” I replied, tightening the straps on my air tank. The crew moved around us, checking gear, their safety briefing sharp and clear: stay with the group, check your air every ten minutes, signal if you’re in trouble. I nodded, but my mind was on the water below, shimmering, calling us to explore its depths.We slipped beneath the surface for our first dive, and it was like stepping into a painting. The water was crystal, sunlight cutting through in golden beams. Fish darted past, their scales flashing red, blue, and yellow, like tiny bursts of color. Coral gardens sprawled below, jagged and alive, home to creatures I’d only seen in books. A sea turtle drifted by, its flippers slow, its eyes calm and ancient. My partner pointed, bubbles streaming from their regulator, and I gave a thumbs-up, my mask fogging from my grin.We surfaced after forty minutes, laughing as we climbed back onto the boat. “That clownfish!” my partner said, peeling off their mask. “It was guarding that anemone like it owned the place.”“I know!” I said, wiping salt from my face. “And that coral wall? Like an underwater city.” We ate sandwiches, swapped stories with other divers, the boat rocking gently. The crew was relaxed, joking, promising the second dive would be even better.The second dive took us deeper, along a reef slope where coral plunged into a shadowy abyss. We followed the group, marveling at a school of barracuda, their bodies glinting like silver knives. My partner tapped my arm, pointing to a spotted ray half-buried in the sand, its gills pulsing. We hovered, watching, until it was time to surface. My legs were tired, but my mind buzzed. “One more dive,” I said as we swapped tanks. “Let’s make it count.”They nodded, eyes gleaming. “Let’s hit that drop-off. It looked incredible.”The crew approved our route, marking it on a map. “Stay near the reef,” the dive leader said. “We’ll pick you up in an hour.” We checked our gear—tanks full, regulators working, dive computers green. Then we dove in, the water swallowing us whole.The drop-off was stunning. The reef fell away into darkness, a coral cliff teeming with life. We drifted along its edge, chasing a school of parrotfish, their green bodies weaving through the water. I checked my air: still good. My partner signaled to keep going, and I agreed, lost in the moment. We ventured further, the group’s bubbles fading behind us. A reef shark glided below, its movements slow but unsettling. I pointed, and my partner gave an “it’s fine” signal. We kept exploring, caught in the reef’s spell.When we surfaced, the boat was gone.I tore off my mask, spinning in the water, scanning the horizon. Nothing but ocean, flat and endless. My chest tightened. “Where’s the boat?” I said, my voice sharp, nearly lost in the waves.My partner surfaced, pulling off their mask. “Maybe it’s just over that swell,” they said, squinting. “They can’t be far.”We floated, life vests keeping us up, fins dangling in the deep. The sun burned my face, salt crusted my lips. Minutes dragged—ten, twenty, thirty. No engine sound, no white hull, nothing. My stomach twisted. “They can’t just leave us,” I said, trying to stay calm.“They’ll come back,” my partner said, but their voice shook. “Maybe they’re picking up others first.”We linked arms to stay together, kicking to keep our heads up. The reef was gone, the ocean too vast. My mouth grew dry, my skin tight from the sun. An hour passed. Then two. My partner kept scanning, their breaths quick. “They’ll notice,” I said, more to myself. “They do headcounts. They have to.”But doubt crept in, cold and heavy. What if they miscounted? What if they thought everyone was onboard? My dive computer beeped—low battery, useless now. My legs ached from treading water. “We need to stay calm,” my partner said, gripping my arm. “Panicking burns energy. They’ll realize we’re missing.”Night fell, and the darkness was suffocating. The ocean turned black, merging with the sky, leaving us in a void. Something brushed my leg—seaweed, I hoped, but my heart pounded. “Did you feel that?” I whispered.“Yeah,” my partner said, their voice small. “Just a fish, right?”We both knew better. The water was too deep, too alive. I scanned the surface, my breath catching as a fin broke through, maybe thirty feet away. A shark, circling slow. My stomach dropped. “Don’t move,” I hissed.“It’s just curious,” my partner said, their hand trembling in mine. The fin dipped below, then reappeared, closer. I wanted to scream, to swim, but that would draw it in. We stayed still, hearts racing, until it vanished.Morning came, and my throat was raw, my tongue like sandpaper. My partner’s face was blistered, their lips cracked. “I saw a boat,” they mumbled, pointing at nothing. “Over there.”I looked, hope flaring, then dying. Empty waves. “There’s nothing,” I said softly, touching their shoulder. They were slipping, hallucinating. My skin burned, my lips bled when I moved them. The ocean didn’t care—it just stretched on, endless.“Talk to me,” I said, desperate to keep us sharp. “What’s the first thing you’ll do when we’re back?”They smiled weakly. “Burger. Biggest one, extra cheese. You?”“Shower. Hot water, forever.” I forced a laugh, but it died fast. Another fin appeared, joined by a second. The sharks were bolder, their shapes clear in the water, eyes cold. My partner’s gaze was distant, their body heavy in my arms.Another day blurred by, or maybe two. Time lost meaning. My partner stopped talking, their head lolling. I shook them, my voice hoarse. “Stay with me. Please.” They didn’t answer, their breaths shallow. I held them close, my strength fading, legs numb. The sharks circled closer, three now, their fins slicing the water. I whispered, “We’re okay,” but it was a lie.Then, a sound—a faint hum. I blinked, my vision blurry, thinking it was another hallucination. But it grew louder, an engine. A boat appeared, small at first, then closer, its hull white against the blue. I waved, my arm heavy, screaming through my cracked throat. “Here! We’re here!”The boat slowed, figures leaning over the side. “We’ve got them!” someone shouted. Hands pulled me aboard, wrapping me in a blanket. I looked back, my partner still in the water, limp. “Get them!” I croaked, pointing. They hauled my partner up, their body pale, unmoving. Someone pressed on their chest, shouting, “Come on, breathe!”I sat, shivering, watching as they worked. My partner coughed, water spilling from their mouth, their eyes fluttering open. Relief hit me like a wave, but it was fleeting. We were alive, but the ocean’s weight lingered in my chest. The crew muttered apologies, something about a miscount, their faces pale. I didn’t care. I held my partner’s hand, their grip weak but there.The boat carried us back, the reef fading behind us. But the memory of that vast, indifferent ocean, and the sharks circling in the dark, stayed with me, a shadow I couldn’t shake.

  


**""A Monster in Plain Sight"":**

I was sixteen, living in a rundown house in Salisbury, a rough corner of Adelaide where the streets felt heavy with despair. Our place was a mess—peeling wallpaper hung in strips, the kitchen sink overflowed with dirty dishes, and the air always carried the stale mix of cigarette smoke and cheap beer. Mum worked double shifts at the supermarket, her face lined with exhaustion, barely scraping enough to pay the bills. My half-brother, Dave, was twenty-two, broad-shouldered, with a temper that flared like a match. He’d pin me against the wall for no reason, his breath hot and sour, snarling, “You’re nothing, you know that? Just a waste of space.” I’d shrink under his glare, heart racing, wishing I could disappear. Home wasn’t safe, not with him around.Then John came into our lives. He lived a few streets over in a tidy brick house that stood out against the cracked pavement and overgrown yards. He was in his thirties, muscular, with a buzz cut and a snake tattoo curling up his forearm, the ink faded but sharp. He started showing up at our place, carrying bags of groceries or tools to fix our leaking sink. “No worries, love,” he’d say to Mum, flashing a wide smile that made her blush. She trusted him, grateful for the help. I did too, at first. He was different from Dave—kind, steady, like he saw me. He’d sit on our sagging couch, sipping tea, and ask about school or what I wanted to do with my life. When I mumbled about Dave’s fists, John’s jaw tightened. “Nobody should treat you like that,” he said, his voice low, eyes serious. “Some people need to learn respect.”John started taking me out, just to get me away from the house. We’d grab burgers at a greasy diner or cruise around in his old white van, the radio blasting rock tunes. The seats were worn, and the dashboard was cluttered with cigarette packs and loose change. He’d talk about the world, how it was broken, how people like pedophiles and creeps slipped through the cracks. “The cops don’t do enough,” he’d say, fingers drumming the steering wheel. “Sometimes you gotta take justice into your own hands.” His words hit me hard. I’d been hurt before, by someone Mum never knew about, someone who’d left scars I couldn’t talk about. John seemed to sense it, like he could read my silence. “You’re safe with me,” he said once, clapping a hand on my shoulder. I believed him. I wanted to.One evening, after Mum had crashed on the couch, the TV flickering with some late-night show, John pulled me aside in the kitchen. The fluorescent light buzzed above us, casting shadows on his face. “I’m working on something big,” he whispered, leaning close enough that I could smell his aftershave. “Cleaning up the streets, getting rid of the worst kinds of people. You in?” His eyes locked on mine, cold but steady, like he was testing me. My throat tightened, but I nodded. I didn’t know what he meant, not really, but I wanted to be part of something. I wanted him to keep looking at me like I was worth something.Things changed after that. John started calling me for “jobs.” At first, it was simple—watching a house down the street, noting who came and went. We’d sit in his van, parked under a streetlight, and he’d point out a guy in a hoodie. “That one’s bad news,” he’d say, voice calm but hard. “Hurts kids. We’re just keeping an eye out.” I believed him, especially after what I’d been through. It felt right, like we were doing good. But my stomach started to knot each time he called.One night, he drove me to a rundown house on the edge of town. The windows were boarded, and the yard was choked with weeds. “Wait in the van,” he said, tossing me a can of soda. The metal was cold against my palm. He went inside with Robert, a quiet guy who sometimes came with us. Robert was lanky, with a shaved head and a stare that made my skin crawl, like he was sizing me up. They were gone for hours. I sat there, the soda going warm, my heart thumping every time a car passed. When John finally came back, his shirt was wrinkled, and he smelled like sweat and something sharp, like bleach. “All done,” he said, sliding into the driver’s seat. He didn’t look at me, just started the engine. I wanted to ask what happened, but the words stuck in my throat. My gut told me I didn’t want to know.People started disappearing. First, it was a neighbor, a guy who’d always creeped me out, always lingering near the park. Then a friend of Dave’s, some loudmouth who hung around the pub. Mum noticed too. One morning, she stormed into Dave’s room and found photos—creepy ones, of kids, hidden in a shoebox. Her scream echoed through the house. “Get out! Get out of my house!” she yelled, throwing his clothes at him. Dave grabbed his bag and left, his face red with rage. I never saw him again. I told John about it later, my voice shaky. He just nodded, like it wasn’t news to him. “We’ll handle it,” he said, his hand resting on my shoulder, heavy and warm. That word—“we”—made my chest tight. I didn’t like it, but I didn’t say anything. John called me “family” now, and it felt good to belong, even if it scared me.The jobs got darker. John started asking me to do more, like carrying bags to his van or standing watch while he and Robert went into places I wasn’t allowed. One night, he took me to an old bank in Snowtown, an hour’s drive from home. The building was abandoned, its windows cracked and boarded, the sign faded to nothing. The air inside was thick, heavy with a sweet, sickening smell that made my stomach churn. “Just a quick stop,” John said, unlocking a side door with a key he shouldn’t have had. His flashlight cut through the dark, showing dust-covered counters and broken tiles. He led me to a vault, its rusted door creaking as he pulled it open. The smell hit me harder—rotting, chemical, like something dead soaked in poison. I saw barrels, big plastic ones, stacked in the corner, their lids sealed tight.“What’s in those?” I asked, my voice barely a whisper. My heart was pounding so hard I thought I’d be sick. John turned, his face half-lit by the flashlight, his eyes cold as stone. “You’re part of this now, Jamie,” he said, stepping closer. “You wanted to help, right?” His voice was calm, but it felt like a threat. I froze, my legs like jelly. I didn’t know what he meant, but I knew it was wrong, so wrong it made my skin crawl. “I... I need air,” I stammered, backing toward the door. He didn’t stop me, just watched, his silhouette looming in the dark. I stumbled outside, gasping, the smell clinging to my clothes.I couldn’t sleep after that. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw those barrels, smelled that stench, imagined what was inside. I started ignoring John’s calls, locking my door when he came by. He’d stand in the yard, all smiles, chatting with Mum like nothing was wrong, but I’d hide in my room, heart racing. I kept thinking about the people who’d vanished, the way John’s voice had changed in that vault. I started wondering if Dave’s disappearance wasn’t just him running off.Then the news broke. Police swarmed Snowtown, their cars clogging the quiet streets. The TV showed reporters outside that bank, talking about bodies—twelve of them—found in barrels filled with acid. Some were people John knew, people I’d seen. Dave was one of them. The news said John and his friends, Robert and another guy, had been killing for years, targeting anyone they thought deserved it—neighbors, friends, even family. They’d tortured them, dissolved them, hidden them in that vault. I felt sick, my hands shaking as I watched. I’d been there. I’d stood in that room.The cops came to our house a few days later, asking questions. I sat at the kitchen table, Mum crying beside me, as I told them everything—John’s jobs, the van, the bank. My voice cracked as I admitted how close I’d come to being part of it, how I’d trusted him. “You’re lucky,” one officer said, his face grim. “He had plans for you too.” The words hit like a punch. I couldn’t breathe, thinking about how John had called me family, how I’d almost followed him deeper.Mum and I moved away, to a small flat far from Salisbury. The news kept talking about John and his group, how they’d been sentenced to life, no parole. But I couldn’t escape it. I’d lie awake, hearing John’s voice in my head, that calm, cold tone: “You’re part of this now.” I’d see those barrels, smell that stench, wonder how I hadn’t seen the monster in him sooner. I was free, but the guilt clung to me, heavy as the air in that vault. I’d wanted to belong, to feel safe, and I’d almost become something else, someone who could’ve helped fill those barrels. The thought still makes my skin crawl, and I know I’ll never forget the moment I realized the man I trusted was a killer, hiding his evil behind a smile.",1,1748409913.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

Two weekends ago I was in my friend's wedding. Up until that point I had spent $450 on flights to go to the joint bach/bachelorette party, $200 on the hotel for that weekend, the other costs that go along with the trip, $500 on flights to go to the wedding, $180 to rent a car because the wedding was in an area pretty remote from the major city I flew into (Shenandoah area outside of DC for those who know), $230 for the wedding hotel, a $150 gift (because that seemed like the right amount?) AND my friend said my shoes were a shade too light so I went out and bought new $75 shoes. We were also told that the wedding was more formal and the invites/other information communicated to us was that this was going to be a pretty nice wedding.

I'm out about $2,000 to be in/go to this wedding, but it felt like the right thing to do for my friend. The wedding was a cottage that had basically no decorations, low quality alcohol/beer/wine that was purchased at the store to serve (which they ran out of near the end of the night), BUFFET STYLE PIZZA/SALAD FOR DINNER WITH PLASTIC FORKS AND PLATES, an extremely mediocre cake, and at 10:15 they started cleaning up around us on the dance floor and were basically telling us to leave. Also no photo booth or coffee or late night food or any other extra thing that weddings usually have to give guests something to do.

Idk... in the moment I was kind of just thinking ""eh whatever no big deal."" But when I got home and looked at my bank account and thought about just how much money I spent for all of this to not even be served a real meal with real forks and a real plate/napkin, I'm just a bit frustrated. \*Sigh\* rant over",7,1748409760.0,offmychest,4,1.0,False

We got sealed in the temple, I’m a convert, and he grew up with the church if that helps add any context here. 

My husband is a die-hard RM. He absolutely loved his mission — it’s something he still talks about all the time and sees as a defining part of his identity. He will go to bat defending Church teachings and argue his beliefs passionately. That said, things are more complicated beneath the surface.

He joined the military a few years ago and doesn’t wear garments in uniform (which I understand), and he occasionally drinks coffee. He also refuses to shave his mustache — not for personal preference, but because someone in the stake presidency told him he should, and he didn’t like being told what to do. His response was, “It’s not official doctrine.” And honestly… he’s right. But it just highlights this contradiction — he’s a naturally rebellious person who has a long history of pushing back against authority, and he even went through his own “faith crisis” back in his teenage years. Still, despite all that, he’s clung tightly to the Church and is extremely defensive of it now. He also is covered in tattoos which he got after his mission while holding a temple recommend and a nose piercing.

Meanwhile, I’m in a completely different place. I’ve been struggling with serious doubts about the Church — its history, truth claims, policies, and culture. There’s a growing part of me that doesn’t know if I believe anymore, and I’m honestly scared of where that might lead in this relationship. Every time I try to open up to him about it, it turns into a debate or he feels personally attacked. He has an answer for everything, and I can’t help but feel like I’m talking to a brick wall when it comes to expressing my doubts or frustrations.

About a year ago we agreed to open the relationship so I could explore my bisexuality. Meaning, he’s fine with me dating/having sexual experiences with other women. With OR without him. To my knowledge this goes against everything the church teaches. Right?

What makes this harder is that we’re raising a child together. I’m scared of what these differences in belief will mean for our family — especially as our son gets older. I’m not trying to deconvert him, and I’m not trying to cause division. I just want to be able to be honest about where I’m at spiritually without it feeling like I’m “the problem” or ruining the “eternal family” narrative.

Has anyone else been in a mixed-faith marriage like this, where your spouse is both deeply committed and low-key rebellious? How do you navigate faith differences when one person sees questioning as a threat and the other sees it as a lifeline?

Not because we don’t care, but because we both couldn't meet each other where we needed to. The reality is, love isn’t always enough when timing, healing, and freedom aren’t on your side.

We parted ways with a mutual understanding... or perhaps more accurately, a mutual ache. Neither of us had the tools to hold the reflection fully, without wounding each other in the reflection. We weren’t ready, not really—too much still unhealed, too many barriers, too many compromises that felt like betrayals to ourselves.

And yet, every day, I think of him. Every hour, his presence brushes up against my thoughts like a soft tide. I feel him in songs, in silence, in the space between my breaths. But I stay away, not because I don’t care, but because I do. And reaching out would only hurt more, for both of us.

There’s a song—Coldplay's *""The Hardest Part""*. I listened to it today and it just hit something deep:

>

Yes. That’s exactly it.

The hardest part isn’t the absence. It’s the knowing they’re still out there, living their life, and I’m no longer allowed a front-row seat. No longer part of the small things—the coffee choices, the bad days, the quiet victories. And I don’t get to ask how he is without it sounding like a disruption. I don’t get to *know* anymore. That is the grief.

But maybe someone out there needs to hear this: If you’ve had to step back from someone you deeply love because the conditions just weren’t right, it doesn’t mean the love wasn’t real. It means you’re brave enough to honor what *is* while holding space for what *might have been.*

If they ever read this... I hope they know I’ve not forgotten. And I hope, in another time, in another version of this life where we are healed, free, and whole—we meet again. Not in chaos, but in calm. Not in longing, but in love.

Until then, I walk forward. Quietly, but with hope.

—  
*To anyone else navigating this ache—you’re not alone.*

As above, so as below. But can we say the same for what’s outside so as inside, can we say that, here is not here?

 

Yamori Kagami is a simple man in his twenties\*\*.\*\* Kind, smart, friendly, not a single enemy; currently enrolled in a training program in hopes of landing a good job. He lives in a share-house in the suburban area of Tokyo, far from the bustling center of the capital. What attracted him was the low rent and the many amenities and household appliances available to residents: theater room, relaxation room, showers, baths, gym, libraries, study room, kitchens, smoking room, patio, rooftop, music studio: everything one could wish to have at home. The share-house was a former industrial building, originally designed to accommodate about two hundred workers, located on the banks of one of Tokyo’s major rivers.

Yamori regularly hung out on the first floor of the house: a large space with a bar, couches, armchairs, a piano, a coworking area, and more. The first floor was ideal for meeting people and socializing. It also faced the *genkan* (the traditional Japanese entryway where people remove their shoes. Since the share-house had only one entrance, it was the perfect spot to see who came and went. As a result, Yamori knew almost every resident, either personally or by sight.

Every once in a while, the residents would gather and organize parties, celebrations, games; anything to encourage social interaction. It could be hard to find a place to be alone; it could be twice as hard to be left alone in that crowd of people.

As it is located in Japan, it is indeed that many residents are locals coming from the many prefectures of the archipelago, but also many foreigners from many countries all around the globe come to crash here, for a month, for years. It brings an interesting atmosphere to the house, but at the same time, it gives a strange vibe to it. Yamori, in between these worlds still finds himself enjoying his time here. He has his friends, plenty of things to do, and whenever he wants to waste time chilling, he can still do it.

One day, Yamori was hanging out with his friends after a party. The young man didn’t drink much, so he wasn’t wasted like his fellows; one of whom mentioned he wanted to play some card games until they were all too tired and retired to their respective rooms. Hearing that idea, Yamori thought about bringing his own deck and swiftly ran to his room.

On his way back to his group of friends, he vaguely noticed someone walking ahead of him. A bit tipsy from the drinks, he didn’t realize who it was, but he saw the person drop a key. Yamori, a reliable man, picked it up, thinking he could quickly return it to its owner. When he arrived at the staircase, he looked up, he looked down. It seemed the person had vanished.

Yamori looked closely at the key holder, just in order to see the room number: maybe the man was one of his acquaintances. It read “323”. So, none of his close friends. As he rejoined the group, he said he had found the key and wanted to know if anyone knew who it belonged to. But his friends were either too wasted or too funny to give a proper answer. Some even suggested organizing a robbery, just for the fun of it (but they would give the stolen objects back anonymously so they wouldn't get into trouble). One of them said Yamori had met the famous ghost of the house.

It is true there is a ghost. According to them, it's the girl from room 666. When he heard that, Yamori laughed and said it had to be some kind of European humor. There are only five floors in the house, a rooftop on floor four, and no basement. So Yamori just put the key in his pocket and said, “The whole of you are really funky people. I think I’ll give the key to the house manager tomorrow, if he survives the hangover!” At that, his friends laughed really hard.

The group played some card games, and after a few rounds, they decided it was time to call it a day and head to bed. Yamori straight up jumped out of his clothes and rolled under the bed sheets. Some of his friends would, as usual, play one last round of their favorite video games. Some would go to the bath. One of them slept deeply in a comfy armchair in the smoking room. Some went straight to work.

The night (although it was already morning) gave way to the day, the house woke up to the smell of tea and coffee. The usual morning ballet of people running everywhere, getting ready for work, for school, for anything really. Yamori too, woke up and went to the kitchen for a breakfast. He sat at one of the large tables were his friend, Satoshi joined.

Satoshi was not at the party yesterday, he spent the night studying, or something like that. He deeply believes he is serious but everyone know he craves on just going radical, it is pretty sure that one of his biggest dreams is to drink as much as he can, and do drugs as much as he could so he could run naked in the streets without regrets. Whenever he speaks it transpired goofiness, no one really know if he is actually that serious, he just sounds like a thesis but he acts like a punk-rocker. As Yamori summed up the party, he quickly moved on another topic: “Satoshi, have you got any idea who is living in the room 323?

\-I am afraid I have not a clue, isn’t it that painter?

\-The French guy? He left six months ago, didn’t he? Recalled Yamori.

\-Well, I really do not have a clue, why is that?

\-Nothing in particular, I found the key, wanted to give him back.

\-Just give it to the manager.” Said Satoshi, scratching the back of his head.

 

For some reason, Yamori kept the keep for a little more. As he randomly stumbled upon Laura, a French girl, doesn’t speak English, doesn’t speak Japanese. He asked her too, I don’t know how he did, but she said she moved like, a week ago. She has no idea. Yamori moved on. He went to do his things, he studied a bit, and then, he saw the old Urano, a kind woman with gray hair. “Urano-san! Do you know who lives in room 323?

\-My poor Kagami, I am afraid I have no idea, why is that?

\-I don’t know… I mean, I know, I found the key of that room, I want to hand it back the the owner.

\-You better hand it to the manager, you know?”

And the cycle repeated itself, it went on for about a week. Yamori asked many times, the answer was always the same. Until he asked his friend Yuya while they were sitting in the patio. Yuya is a man of culture and knowledge, but unlike Satoshi, he never hesitates when it comes to do LSD. Never shies when it comes to smoke some weed. Maybe Yuya is an advanced version of Satoshi, whereas Yamori is a primitive version of what he is about to become.

“Why haven’t you already handed the key to the manager? Could be considered theft, you know? Said Yuya.

\-I don’t know. It has been a while now. It’s just, I saw that guy, he dropped that key, I wanted to give him but it feels like he disappeared. Desperately answered Yamori.

\-What if that person left the house and moved somewhere else? Just give up, you might never ever see that person again. I know it’s sad, it makes me sad too. Just give that key to the manager, get rid of that as soon as possible.

\-The more I think about it, the more I want to know. I am drawn to that stupid door. At first, I didn’t care and just wanted to be kind because this is how I am. But the longer I kept that key, the more I…” tried to explain Yamori who stopped all of a sudden. The two men exchanged a glance. After what Yuya said “Sometime it’s better to not know. What if you find something you regret finding? Just give that key to the manager, what’s inside that room is none of our concern.”

 

Some more time passed. Yamori definitely never gave that key to the damn manager. Until, at the most random moment of the day, the boy decided to bring the key to the manager’s office. He walks the hallway with determination, guided by the wisdom of his housemates, with the willpower of a thousand men. *“Today I get rid of that stupid key,”* he was thinking. He walks down the stairs; it’s a matter of seconds before he arrives at the manager’s office.

Yamori stops with confidence. He pulls the key out of his pocket - one last time, he reads: *“Room 323.”* He lifts his chin. On the door in front of him, it reads: *“Room 323.”*  
Clearly, he changed his mind on the way to the manager’s office. Yamori is now staring at the door. It’s the most normal door ever. Just another among two hundred others. Nothing eerie coming out of it. No energy flowing. No magic symbols appearing. No - nothing. Only Yamori standing in front of his fate.

Actually, at that moment, he still has the ability and a good amount of control. He could turn around, go to that office, and just say: *“Hello, I found this key. Have a nice day.”*  
Had he just found the key without seeing that human figure vanishing, he wouldn’t even care about that place.

But Yamori Kagami just seemed to not care about the house ethic at that very moment. One last time, for half a second, he hesitates. “I know, it’s true, I shouldn’t, that’s privacy violation. That may be one of the least stupid made-up rules, but I still feel like I have to break it into pieces.” Thought Yamori. Then he started thinking “I’m not doing any harm. I’m not going to touch anything. I just go in, give a glance and fuck off”.

Yamori inserts the key into the door lock. It slides like well-made *shouji*. He turns the key, grabs the cold door knob, and push that heavy steel door. That’s it. He is inside room 323. No ghost, no monster, no dead people lying in dry blood. No rotting food and mols spread everywhere. No spiderweb. No, nothing. Which, to Yamori, sort of feels off. It has been two weeks or so, everything is clean like the room was tidied today. It even smells pretty good, like freshly cleaned wardrobe and bed sheets. “This could be because the resident is actually still here” thought Yamori. “Yes, when people move, they usually drop a *take free* box, but I haven’t seen any of it recently.” And so Yamori started feeling dumb, he made up all sort of possibilities inside his head, so many expectations for nothing, just breaking in someone’s private space.

So, he is standing in the middle of that tiny room. Looking around, lurking the area in an idiotic way. Then he thought “oh, the clock on the wall may be out of battery, the hands are still” yes, it could be that, but now something strikes him, the clock indicates 03:23. “Funny, just like the room number” came to think Yamori. He, though, didn’t made a case out of that. His sight, then, crawled down the wall, photographs were pinned on the wall; faces of unknown people. Could have been the resident, could have been anyone on Earth and in the universe. Just in order to verify if he happened to recognize anyone he saw in the house, Yamori approached and stared at the pictures. “Polaroids definitely hit different; this should really come back as a standard” said the boy in his head. Some of the pictures were showing people partying, portraits, a couple holding hands, some landscapes, a river, a house. Timeless beauty of the 90’s, people living the moment, or maybe that is just the effect of the polaroids. As Yamori’s eyes keep on venturing the wall his attention gets caught by variety of items. A toy car, the kind you can build, customize, race against your friends in a circuit; one of the funniest toys from Japan. “Hey, I had one of those as a kid!” though Yamori with nostalgia. Then, he saw a few stuffed animals and plushies, some posters from bands or movies. “Sonatine, I never saw that movie, I guess who ever lived here really liked it” pursued Yamori in his head. At some point the man saw a pile of books and letters and, for some reasons, he started to dig through the works. Some Dostoevski, Mishima, Kawabata, Sartre, Marx, Primo Levi, Camus, Orwell, Lenin, plenty of essays and thesis. Yamori grabbed *No Exit* by Jean Paul Sartre and casted a careless glance at the book cover, “let’s see what’s that book about”. He opened it at the last page thinking that he would understand the whole book and read “Garcin: Hell is other people

\-Why you say that Garcin, why your name’s so funny, Garcin?” Asked Yamori to the book.

As he browsed the paged, a letter fell on the book pile below. The boy grabbed it with a hand while holding *No Exit* with the other. The letter was signed, but the hand writing was barely readable.

 

Dear \*\*\*\*\*

Whis I was \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*. Here, every day is a rainy day.

* \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* like the rain, but not here. It feels like \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

\*\*\* seemed \* \*\*\* off lately, I wish I was here, I would cheer \*\*\* \*\*.

I don’t know how much ink I have left \*\*\* \*\*\*, if only the rain was ink.

I could \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* endlessly.

Answer \*\* anything, as long as you breath, I’ll be \*\*\*\*\*\*\*.

Shi\*\*ka

 

Without thinking anything particular about the content – more about the awful handwriting, Yamori put the letter back in the book, and put the book back on the pile. He stood back up when he saw, slightly under the pillow on the bed, another letter. Like an automaton, he took it, and started reading.

 

Dear \*\*\*zuka,

 

\* \*\*\*\*\* cannot forgive myself.

Writing to you is pointless, you’re already a wind, a wave, and I am still \*\*, standing.

\* \*\*\* know if it makes me feel better or worse to write that pointless letter.

I will never forgive myself. You called me. We were \*\*\*\*less.

Now I know, you just wanted me by your side.

I failed you; I can’t bear \*\*\*\*\*\*\* anymore.

You were the one, I was the none.

You called me. \*\* were helpless. \*\*\*\* \*\*\* nothing I could do to save you, that I thought.

True.

But \*\*\*\* \*\*\*\*\* save me, was being with you,

When you sang your last note.

Now I am only a piano without strings.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* the night the sun rises, we will be again together.

If not:

Too bad.

\*\*\*\*\*

 

Chills crawled from the bottom of Yamori’s spine. “I shouldn’t be reading this” he thought. I quickly put that letter under the pillow where he found it. As he stood back up, he soon realized the room was actually filled with letters and polaroids with annotations. And, as the room was slowly filling with darkness, he realized he might have spent too much time in here. He reached the curtains, looking to let a bit of outside light enter.

In the share-house every room has a balcony with sliding glass doors. The ones from the room were covered with newspaper. Ranging from the Showa period, to Heisei, up to Reiwa. But what matters most is not the content of the newspapers, it’s rather what was painted on it.

*Here is not here.*

Yamori spent about an hour in that room, and never noticed that message on the windows. He was shivering all of a sudden. As he started turning on his feet to reach the door, a necktie dropped from the ceiling. The apparel was tied in a knot, Yamori saw it clearly and whatever was that for, it shocked the boy who fell back on the pile of book.

He realized how the room changed since he entered. The fresh smell vanished long ago, crushed under a cavernous fragrance of dust and metal. The wallpaper was torn, and the paint on the ceiling was falling. All the people on the photographs look distorted; their eyes hidden by deep shadows. The room was about to swallow Yamori.

He gathered some strength and ran to the door that became rusty and cracked. In a desperate movement he slammed opened it and got on the other side.

The hallway that was bright before he entered was now threatened by a flickering red light. Every half a second, Yamori was plunged into darkness for what felt like ages. He looked back at the room 323 door as if it would help him understand what was happening, when he realized the room number was upside down. The room door in front too. Actually, all room numbers were upside down throughout the whole hallway. But Yamori was not expecting what was standing at the end of the hallway, lurking in the darkness.

I was diagnosed with psoriasis 15 years ago (I’m a 37-year-old dude). It started pretty mild—just some scalp stuff—but the last three years have been a total nightmare. It spread almost everywhere—not big patches like some of you brave souls have (seriously, how do you deal with that? Mad respect), but hundreds of tiny patches all over: eyelids, inside my ears, and yes, even right up my asscrack. Flare-ups every month with new spots popping up, and I was drowning in corticosteroid creams and trying every lifestyle hack I could think of.

Here’s what I cut out:
	•	Alcohol
	•	Coffee
	•	Dairy
	•	Red meat
	•	Gluten
	•	Also, apparently fun

Nothing worked.

I tried all kinds of creams, light therapy, and methotrexate. Nope. Methotrexate just gave me weird side effects.

Then yesterday (technically today)…

Biologics.

After just 12 hours from my first shot, I’m already feeling something different. The patches feel different, and I haven’t been picking off flaky skin because it actually feels like it’s healing. Didn’t expect to notice this fast! I’ll try to keep you all updated if you want.

Oh, and does anyone else get insanely fatigued from psoriasis? I’ve been wiped out during flare-ups for years. Could be coincidence, but for the first time in a long time, I actually feel clear-headed and awake. Maybe Yuflyma is my new coffee… without the jitters.

That's not something she should do."" I had been dating Claude for four years; he was my first boyfriend, and I found him in my bed, in my room, sleeping with Kelly, my cousin...Reading this story for free comment yes","I got home after a long day, and my parents were waiting for me in the living room.

""Catherine, sit down. We need to talk,"" my father said, looking quite agitated.

""What's going on, Dad?"" I asked tiredly. I had worked all day, gone to college at night, and upon getting home, all I wanted was to take a shower and crash into bed. But that wasn't possible.

""Catherine, your cousin's wedding invitation has arrived,"" my mother said.

""That little tramp is not my cousin!"" I snapped, already getting angry.

""Catherine, she is your cousin,"" my mother insisted. ""You need to stop this childish behavior. Melissa already hit her and caused a scene here at home. Enough! She's my sister's daughter, which makes her your cousin.""

""I'm sorry, Mom, but she means nothing to me,"" I tried to stay calm. ""She slept with my boyfriend in my bed. That's not something she should do.""

I had been dating Claude for four years; he was my first boyfriend, and I found him in my bed, in my room, sleeping with Kelly, my cousin! I was in shock. Of course, Melissa, my best friend, went after them. Since then, things had been tensed at home because my parents insisted it was silly and that I should act as if nothing had happened and go back to being around my cousin.

""He was wrong, Catherine, since he was your boyfriend,"" my mother argued. ""Kelly, poor thing, was seduced. He dishonored her, now he's marrying her so she won't be talked about badly in town.""

""Oh, Mom! Spare me! The whole town knows Kelly is a shameless woman..."" I lost my patience.

""Catherine, watch your language!"" my father scolded me. ""Look, if you don't want to be around Kelly, fine, but you're going to this wedding. And enough with this rude behavior.""

""I'm what?"" I thought I had heard wrong.

""You're going to your cousin's wedding, Catherine. That's an order! We're your parents, and you'll obey,"" my mother spoke angrily at me as if I were the one in the wrong.

""I'm sorry, Mom, but I won't! I follow your rules, I'm a good daughter, but this time I can't. I was the one who was wronged! I have every right not to want to be the family joke anymore,"" I said, already crying.

""ENOUGH, CATHERINE!"" my father shouted, startling me. ""You're going to this wedding, and that's final.""

""But, Dad...""

""I don't want to hear it, Catherine! It's important to your mother to keep peace in the family. So you're going, period,"" my father said, leaving no room for argument.

I spent the night crying in my room. The next day, I told Melissa everything. She wasted no time and arranged invitations to a masquerade ball, a gala event. She told my parents it would be crucial for my career since the city's most important businesspeople would be there. I could make valuable connections, and our professors had promised to introduce us to various entrepreneurs who could open doors for our professional future.

At first, my parents weren't entirely convinced, but Melissa's parents talked to them and persuaded them that it would be an excellent opportunity for my future. So they agreed that I should take advantage of it.

""Catherine, you can't say no to me! I've already bought the tickets and masks, and I even convinced your parents that this is a super important event for your professional future, which was such hard work. This party is going to be incredible, and you're not going to miss it!"" Melissa looked at me with puppy dog eyes, clasping her hands together as if begging.

I was sitting at my desk at work in the middle of a Thursday afternoon, between taking messages and making calls, when Mel showed up with coffee, chocolate muffins, and this persistence about getting me to agree to go to the masquerade ball, which was the biggest annual event in our city.

""Oh, Mel, how is it that I can never say no to you? Alright, I'll go!""

I agreed to go to the ball, but I still wasn't sure. Either way, I was going to sleep at Mel's house to avoid the wedding, but I wasn't planning on going to the party. However, Melissa kept pushing until she convinced me to go. On Saturday, we got ready at her place.

""Wow, girl! You look absolutely stunning!"" She handed me a beautiful golden mask, intricately designed like lace that covered up to my nose, and I put it on. I was wearing a shimmering red satin dress, and the mask matched perfectly. ""So, are we ready?""

""Yes, we're ready,"" I replied and grabbed my purse. ""Oh, I forgot my perfume.""

""No problem, you can use my mom's new perfume. She won't mind.""

When Fred, Mel's boyfriend, saw us, he smiled, gave Mel a kiss, and said:

""Girls, you look gorgeous! I think you'll leave this party with a new boyfriend, Cat.""

""No boyfriend, Fred. Actually, I think I'd better stay, I'm not in the party mood. Please, Mel, let me stay?""

Chapter 2

There was no way out - my friend dragged me to the ball. As soon as we got in, Mel pulled us to the bar and whispered in my ear:

""It's an open bar tonight, so you're going to drink until all that sadness washes away!"" Mel handed me two tequila shots while holding two more in her hands. ""Let's down these!"" We knocked back the tequila, and Fred was already handing each of us a cosmopolitan.

Melissa dragged me to the dance floor, and I was actually having fun. When a slow song started playing, Fred and Mel began slow dancing together. I took that as my cue to head to the buffet, but I didn't make it there. I felt someone grab my hand, and when I turned around, there was a man in a black mask smiling at me - and what a smile! He kissed my hand and pulled me close, whispering in my ear with a husky voice:

""Surely the most beautiful woman in the room won't deny me a dance, will she?""

""And why not? Let's dance,"" I smiled back at him.

It was impossible to resist that seductive husky voice and that gorgeous crooked smile! He was tall with broad shoulders, had a charming smile and blue eyes - so blue they were almost violet. He had sinfully tempting lips, brown hair, and when he pulled me by the waist, I placed my hands on his chest and could feel he was a wall of well-defined muscle. Although the mask concealed his face, he was very charming and enchanting.

""I've been watching you since you arrived,"" this mysterious man whispered in my ear. ""You're so beautiful!""

""You're kind. But you're not from around here, are you?"" He had a powerful presence, radiating authority.

""No. A friend convinced me to come to this party.""

""Looks like we have something in common - my friends convinced me to come too.""

""Lucky me!""

""And why's that?"" I smiled.

""Because I was captivated the moment I saw you. You're stunning."" As he whispered in my ear, I got goosebumps, feeling my face flush and my body tingle - he truly had me enchanted.

""Even with the mask?""

""Even with the mask! You're too beautiful.""

""You're such a charmer.""

""You think I'm charming?""

""You know you are. And handsome too.""

""I'm glad you like what you see.""

""And what do you do for a living, handsome?"" - I felt a bit dizzy, not sure if it was from the drink or the delicious cologne that man was wearing. I ended up stumbling over my own feet.

""Are you okay?""

""I think I need some air.""

""Come with me."" - He pulled me into a dark hallway that led to an emergency exit and started fanning my face. - ""I really want to kiss you. May I?"" - I nodded yes.

He looked into my eyes, held the back of my neck, and our lips met. It started slow but deepened; he pressed me against the wall, and the kiss intensified even more, almost taking our breath away. When he broke the kiss so we could breathe, we looked into each other's eyes - it was like throwing gasoline on fire. He ran his hand down my waist to my leg and pulled my leg up to his waist. I was completely surrendered by then, feeling his body against mine. I went crazy with desire and pulled him closer, wrapping my leg around his waist.

""You're a great kisser!"" - I smiled at him and felt my whole body tingle.

""Oh, beautiful, you're incredible. I want you so badly, here, right now!"" - he said between kisses and slipped his hand under my dress, pulling it up and reaching my underwear. I was on fire when he put his hand inside my underwear and yelled. - ""Oh! So delicious! So hot, so wet!"" - He said and kissed me harder while unzipping his pants. With a quick movement, like someone who had done this before, he tore my underwear and caressed my entrance, as if asking for permission. He looked into my eyes again and asked: ""What do you want me to do?""

""I want you inside me now!"" I responded shamelessly, already panting with desire. I couldn't resist those eyes and that husky voice. I'd never been like this before - normally, I would have pulled away the moment he grabbed my hand, but tonight I had promised myself to have fun and live in the moment if someone interesting came along. And that's exactly what I was doing, living in the moment.

Hearing me, he entered me slowly, watching as I leaned my head against the wall and savored every inch of him - and he was huge. He took the opportunity to scatter kisses along my neck. When he was fully inside, he paused and whispered between kisses in my ear: ""Now I'm going to move."" He pulled out only to thrust back in with full force this time, and it was incredible. I was completely lost and driven wild by his movements as he moved in and out of me frantically.

We lost control and gave ourselves over completely, as if nothing else existed around us. I felt a haze in my eyes as my climax began to build, and I moaned softly in his ear. At that moment, he seemed to go crazy, lifting my other leg to his waist as I wrapped them around him. Kissing me intensely, he thrust even harder into me - it was heaven on earth. I came again, even more intensely than before, leaving me breathless. As I was coming, he whispered that he was close to his limit feeling me pulse around him, and soon I felt his hot release inside me.

We stayed there against that wall, completely breathless, his forehead resting against mine. While kissing me, he slowly withdrew, and I was thoroughly satisfied - as Melissa would say. I smiled and he looked at me, gave me a soft kiss and said:

""You're truly amazing!""

He gently lowered my legs until my feet touched the ground, fixed my dress, adjusted his pants, and hugged me. It was so intimate, so affectionate - despite the wildness of our encounter and the intensity with which we'd given in to each other, he was still gentle with me. I'd never had such an incredible experience, but I'd only ever been with my ex until now. And my ex had never cared about hugging me afterward, or worried about my pleasure - for him, it was just about getting in and out until he was satisfied. So having a man care about me, about my pleasure, take care of me - it was new, and amazingly so. He kissed my neck and whispered in my ear:

""So, beautiful, I still don't know your name."" It took me seconds to process and finally realize that I'd just slept with a complete stranger whose name I didn't even know.

Just as I was about to speak, he pulled his phone from his pocket and asked for a minute to answer it. He stepped away slightly and I could only hear him raising his voice saying:

""What did you say?"" At that moment, the stranger ran off as if he'd forgotten about me, or as if he was just running away from the woman he'd quickly hooked up with at the party.

Of course, Catherine, you're an idiot! But so what? I was just having fun too, and I didn't even know who the guy was, and he didn't know who I was. All good. I pulled myself together, looked in vain for my underwear - no idea where he'd thrown it - and left that hallway.

I went back to the table and found Mel and Fred making out. They soon stopped and focused on me:

""Mel, I think I found the Big Bad Wolf!"" I laughed, and she laughed with me.

""When we get home, I want to know everything!""

""Of course you do!"" I replied with sparkling eyes.

""Prince, I think we can go now. What do you think, Cat?""

""I'm ready whenever you are!"" I said, downing a glass of water.

""Let's go then, girls!"" Fred said and led us to the exit.

We'd barely gotten home when Mel started demanding:

""Tell me everything - who is he, how it went, how it didn't go, everything.""

I laughed and told her everything. When I finished speaking, my friend was staring at me open-mouthed and asked:

""You guys used protection, right?""

My heart started racing! We hadn't used protection. I shook my head no at her; I was in shock realizing how careless I'd been. She immediately tried to calm me down:

""No, Cat, calm down. I'm sure nothing will come of it. But you should get some tests done to make sure everything's okay. I'm going to the kitchen to make us some tea. Don't freak out!""

Chapter 3

On Monday during lunch, I met Mel. She handed me a small bag from a fancy store, and I looked at her, confused.

""My mom asked me to give this to you. She said it's perfect for you and doesn't suit her,"" Mel said with a big smile.

I opened the bag, and inside was the perfume I had worn to the ball. A huge smile spread across my face. I loved that perfume, and it was part of the best night of my life. I just hoped that my best night hadn't left me with an STD as a souvenir. With that thought, I thanked Mel and told her I'd call her mom later, then mentioned I wanted to call the lab to schedule some tests.

I called the laboratory and was informed that I needed a doctor's prescription to get the tests covered by health insurance. Thank God the company provided health insurance for employees because otherwise, I wouldn't know what to do. My salary wasn't high, and what little was left after covering college expenses went to helping at home, since my mom didn't work outside the house and my dad didn't make much as a driver.

So I made a doctor's appointment, but the earliest available slot was two weeks away, and I waited anxiously. The more days passed, the more nervous I became, though Mel did everything to calm me down. On the scheduled date, she went to the doctor's with me. With the list of tests in hand, she personally scheduled the lab work and insisted on accompanying me. Three weeks had passed since the party when I finally got the tests done. The results came back five days later, and I returned to the doctor. Of course, Mel was with me.

The doctor checked the results and looked me in the eyes:

""Miss Catherine, your health is excellent. You're healthy. But from now on, you'll need to take better care of yourself.""

I breathed a sigh of relief, but was I really about to get lectured by the doctor for having unprotected bedlife with a stranger? Well, I deserved it - not using protection was silly, I could have caught a disease. And then he continued:

""Congratulations, you're conceived! I'm going to refer you to an OB-GYN for prenatal care...""

I didn't hear anything else, just the blood pulsing in my ears. I couldn't believe this! conceived? How would I explain this? It's not possible. Me, of all people, the perfect goody-two-shoes who never stepped out of line, who always considered the consequences before doing anything, who was always responsible - the first time I let rationality slide, I ended up conceived and didn't even know who the father was! Mel held my hand and kept repeating:

""Calm down, Cat, everything will be okay!""

How could everything be okay? I didn't even know who the father was. I would have to tell my parents, their only daughter would break their hearts. They would be disappointed, hate me, and kick me out of the house. How could I explain that I don't even know what the father of my child looks like? I was already hyperventilating. Suddenly, I felt the doctor taking my hand and speaking calmly:

""Easy now, dear! The situation, from what I can see, isn't ideal, but you can't get this nervous, it will harm your baby. Now you have to take care of yourself for the baby's sake. I'm sure the people who love you will support and help you. But you need to calm down because only you can ensure this baby develops healthily and is born strong. Do you understand me?""

I looked at that short, white-haired, slightly chubby gentleman, with his glasses perched on the tip of his nose, and nodded positively. Somehow he calmed me down a bit, maybe because his eyes sparkled with a kindness and understanding that we rarely see these days. The doctor asked his secretary to bring me some chamomile tea, and while I drank it and tried to calm down, he gave all the information to Melissa, who listened attentively.

We left the office and Melissa took me to a diner, saying we needed to eat something. As soon as I sat down, I felt the tears falling. My friend hugged me and told me once again that I wasn't alone. I looked at her and said:

""The only thing I'm sure of right now is that I want you and Fred to be my child's godparents because I know you'll support them and give them lots of love.""

Her eyes sparkled, and she burst into tears, responding between sobs:

""I'll be the best godmother in the world and I'll always be close to our baby! And I'm sure Fred will be very happy too!""

She assured me she would always be by my side, made it clear that I wouldn't go through anything alone, and that she would be with me when I talked to my parents. My parents... oh! I started thinking and decided I wouldn't hide it from them for even a day; I would tell them that very night. I wouldn't go to college, I would go home to talk to them. Mel immediately supported me and said:

""Let's go then, I'm with you!""

When we arrived at my house, my parents were startled, and my mom came right over, worried:

""Girls, didn't you go to class today? Is everything okay?""

""Not really, Mom. I need to talk to you both.""

My parents immediately realized it was something very serious. We all sat in the living room and I told them what was happening, admitting I had been irresponsible by hooking up with a stranger at the party. I obviously didn't go into details, but I made it clear that I couldn't find my child's father again. The disappointment in their eyes was evident. My mother was sobbing uncontrollably, saying I was ruined. My father hadn't said anything yet. Seeing how upset my mother was, Melissa quickly went to the kitchen and came back with a glass of sugar water for her. Melissa always gives sugar water to nervous people, saying it calms them down - I never understood that.

Finally, my father spoke:

""You made a huge mistake and there's no going back.""

My parents were very simple people. My father was a tall, strong man, and my mother was an older version of me, but both had great character and solid principles they always made sure to pass on to me. Hearing my father emphasize that I had messed up made my heart ache even more. I started crying and said:

""I know, Dad, I was irresponsible. But there's nothing I can do now. I'll drop out of college to raise my child. And I'm going to pack my bags...""

""Pack your bags? You're very mistaken if you think you're leaving this house like that. You made a mistake, and you disappointed us, but we love you, we'll get through this and we'll help you. You're not alone, my daughter! And neither is this child!"" My father said this and my heart filled with hope.

""But Dad, I brought shame to you...""

""You're not the first and won't be the last single mother in this world. We would have liked things to be different for you, not so difficult. You've always been so responsible! But if this is how it is, we'll face it together. You won't leave college - more than ever, you need to grow in life to take care of your child. You're going to be a single mother, your responsibility is huge. We'll help you, and even though it will be difficult, everything will work out.""

Melissa was already crying and quickly spoke to my parents:

""Mr. Anthony, Mrs. Selina, you can count on me, I'll help with everything! Besides, I'm this baby's godmother, Cat is like a sister to me, and I'll always be around.""

My parents looked at her gratefully. I looked at those three feeling completely blessed to have them in my life, full of love for them and experiencing a totally new feeling for that little being still growing inside me, whose existence I had just discovered!

As difficult as being a single mother would be, that night at the ball was the best night of my life. I could never forget those violet-blue eyes looking at me with adoration during our furtive encounter and everything my body experienced that night. I would always have that sweet memory with me.

The following months were difficult. I kept the dress, shoes, mask, and perfume that Mel's mother gave me in a box. On difficult days, I would open that box and relive that night in my memory.",1,1748408907.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

As above, so as below. But can we say the same for what’s outside so as inside, can we say that, here is not here?

 

Yamori Kagami is a simple man in his twenties**.** Kind, smart, friendly, not a single enemy; currently enrolled in a training program in hopes of landing a good job. He lives in a share-house in the suburban area of Tokyo, far from the bustling center of the capital. What attracted him was the low rent and the many amenities and household appliances available to residents: theater room, relaxation room, showers, baths, gym, libraries, study room, kitchens, smoking room, patio, rooftop, music studio: everything one could wish to have at home. The share-house was a former industrial building, originally designed to accommodate about two hundred workers, located on the banks of one of Tokyo’s major rivers.

Yamori regularly hung out on the first floor of the house: a large space with a bar, couches, armchairs, a piano, a coworking area, and more. The first floor was ideal for meeting people and socializing. It also faced the *genkan* (the traditional Japanese entryway where people remove their shoes. Since the share-house had only one entrance, it was the perfect spot to see who came and went. As a result, Yamori knew almost every resident, either personally or by sight.

Every once in a while, the residents would gather and organize parties, celebrations, games; anything to encourage social interaction. It could be hard to find a place to be alone; it could be twice as hard to be left alone in that crowd of people.

As it is located in Japan, it is indeed that many residents are locals coming from the many prefectures of the archipelago, but also many foreigners from many countries all around the globe come to crash here, for a month, for years. It brings an interesting atmosphere to the house, but at the same time, it gives a strange vibe to it. Yamori, in between these worlds still finds himself enjoying his time here. He has his friends, plenty of things to do, and whenever he wants to waste time chilling, he can still do it.



One day, Yamori was hanging out with his friends after a party. The young man didn’t drink much, so he wasn’t wasted like his fellows; one of whom mentioned he wanted to play some card games until they were all too tired and retired to their respective rooms. Hearing that idea, Yamori thought about bringing his own deck and swiftly ran to his room.

On his way back to his group of friends, he vaguely noticed someone walking ahead of him. A bit tipsy from the drinks, he didn’t realize who it was, but he saw the person drop a key. Yamori, a reliable man, picked it up, thinking he could quickly return it to its owner. When he arrived at the staircase, he looked up, he looked down. It seemed the person had vanished.



Yamori looked closely at the key holder, just in order to see the room number: maybe the man was one of his acquaintances. It read “323”. So, none of his close friends. As he rejoined the group, he said he had found the key and wanted to know if anyone knew who it belonged to. But his friends were either too wasted or too funny to give a proper answer. Some even suggested organizing a robbery, just for the fun of it (but they would give the stolen objects back anonymously so they wouldn't get into trouble). One of them said Yamori had met the famous ghost of the house.

It is true there is a ghost. According to them, it's the girl from room 666. When he heard that, Yamori laughed and said it had to be some kind of European humor. There are only five floors in the house, a rooftop on floor four, and no basement. So Yamori just put the key in his pocket and said, “The whole of you are really funky people. I think I’ll give the key to the house manager tomorrow, if he survives the hangover!” At that, his friends laughed really hard.

The group played some card games, and after a few rounds, they decided it was time to call it a day and head to bed. Yamori straight up jumped out of his clothes and rolled under the bed sheets. Some of his friends would, as usual, play one last round of their favorite video games. Some would go to the bath. One of them slept deeply in a comfy armchair in the smoking room. Some went straight to work.

The night (although it was already morning) gave way to the day, the house woke up to the smell of tea and coffee. The usual morning ballet of people running everywhere, getting ready for work, for school, for anything really. Yamori too, woke up and went to the kitchen for a breakfast. He sat at one of the large tables were his friend, Satoshi joined.

Satoshi was not at the party yesterday, he spent the night studying, or something like that. He deeply believes he is serious but everyone know he craves on just going radical, it is pretty sure that one of his biggest dreams is to drink as much as he can, and do drugs as much as he could so he could run naked in the streets without regrets. Whenever he speaks it transpired goofiness, no one really know if he is actually that serious, he just sounds like a thesis but he acts like a punk-rocker. As Yamori summed up the party, he quickly moved on another topic: “Satoshi, have you got any idea who is living in the room 323?

\-I am afraid I have not a clue, isn’t it that painter?

\-The French guy? He left six months ago, didn’t he? Recalled Yamori.

\-Well, I really do not have a clue, why is that?

\-Nothing in particular, I found the key, wanted to give him back.

\-Just give it to the manager.” Said Satoshi, scratching the back of his head.

 

For some reason, Yamori kept the keep for a little more. As he randomly stumbled upon Laura, a French girl, doesn’t speak English, doesn’t speak Japanese. He asked her too, I don’t know how he did, but she said she moved like, a week ago. She has no idea. Yamori moved on. He went to do his things, he studied a bit, and then, he saw the old Urano, a kind woman with gray hair. “Urano-san! Do you know who lives in room 323?

\-My poor Kagami, I am afraid I have no idea, why is that?

\-I don’t know… I mean, I know, I found the key of that room, I want to hand it back the the owner.

\-You better hand it to the manager, you know?”

And the cycle repeated itself, it went on for about a week. Yamori asked many times, the answer was always the same. Until he asked his friend Yuya while they were sitting in the patio. Yuya is a man of culture and knowledge, but unlike Satoshi, he never hesitates when it comes to do LSD. Never shies when it comes to smoke some weed. Maybe Yuya is an advanced version of Satoshi, whereas Yamori is a primitive version of what he is about to become.

“Why haven’t you already handed the key to the manager? Could be considered theft, you know? Said Yuya.

\-I don’t know. It has been a while now. It’s just, I saw that guy, he dropped that key, I wanted to give him but it feels like he disappeared. Desperately answered Yamori.

\-What if that person left the house and moved somewhere else? Just give up, you might never ever see that person again. I know it’s sad, it makes me sad too. Just give that key to the manager, get rid of that as soon as possible.

\-The more I think about it, the more I want to know. I am drawn to that stupid door. At first, I didn’t care and just wanted to be kind because this is how I am. But the longer I kept that key, the more I…” tried to explain Yamori who stopped all of a sudden. The two men exchanged a glance. After what Yuya said “Sometime it’s better to not know. What if you find something you regret finding? Just give that key to the manager, what’s inside that room is none of our concern.”

 

Some more time passed. Yamori definitely never gave that key to the damn manager. Until, at the most random moment of the day, the boy decided to bring the key to the manager’s office. He walks the hallway with determination, guided by the wisdom of his housemates, with the willpower of a thousand men. *“Today I get rid of that stupid key,”* he was thinking. He walks down the stairs; it’s a matter of seconds before he arrives at the manager’s office.

Yamori stops with confidence. He pulls the key out of his pocket - one last time, he reads: *“Room 323.”* He lifts his chin. On the door in front of him, it reads: *“Room 323.”*  
Clearly, he changed his mind on the way to the manager’s office. Yamori is now staring at the door. It’s the most normal door ever. Just another among two hundred others. Nothing eerie coming out of it. No energy flowing. No magic symbols appearing. No - nothing. Only Yamori standing in front of his fate.

Actually, at that moment, he still has the ability and a good amount of control. He could turn around, go to that office, and just say: *“Hello, I found this key. Have a nice day.”*  
Had he just found the key without seeing that human figure vanishing, he wouldn’t even care about that place.

But Yamori Kagami just seemed to not care about the house ethic at that very moment. One last time, for half a second, he hesitates. “I know, it’s true, I shouldn’t, that’s privacy violation. That may be one of the least stupid made-up rules, but I still feel like I have to break it into pieces.” Thought Yamori. Then he started thinking “I’m not doing any harm. I’m not going to touch anything. I just go in, give a glance and fuck off”.

Yamori inserts the key into the door lock. It slides like well-made *shouji*. He turns the key, grabs the cold door knob, and push that heavy steel door. That’s it. He is inside room 323. No ghost, no monster, no dead people lying in dry blood. No rotting food and mols spread everywhere. No spiderweb. No, nothing. Which, to Yamori, sort of feels off. It has been two weeks or so, everything is clean like the room was tidied today. It even smells pretty good, like freshly cleaned wardrobe and bed sheets. “This could be because the resident is actually still here” thought Yamori. “Yes, when people move, they usually drop a *take free* box, but I haven’t seen any of it recently.” And so Yamori started feeling dumb, he made up all sort of possibilities inside his head, so many expectations for nothing, just breaking in someone’s private space.

So, he is standing in the middle of that tiny room. Looking around, lurking the area in an idiotic way. Then he thought “oh, the clock on the wall may be out of battery, the hands are still” yes, it could be that, but now something strikes him, the clock indicates 03:23. “Funny, just like the room number” came to think Yamori. He, though, didn’t made a case out of that. His sight, then, crawled down the wall, photographs were pinned on the wall; faces of unknown people. Could have been the resident, could have been anyone on Earth and in the universe. Just in order to verify if he happened to recognize anyone he saw in the house, Yamori approached and stared at the pictures. “Polaroids definitely hit different; this should really come back as a standard” said the boy in his head. Some of the pictures were showing people partying, portraits, a couple holding hands, some landscapes, a river, a house. Timeless beauty of the 90’s, people living the moment, or maybe that is just the effect of the polaroids. As Yamori’s eyes keep on venturing the wall his attention gets caught by variety of items. A toy car, the kind you can build, customize, race against your friends in a circuit; one of the funniest toys from Japan. “Hey, I had one of those as a kid!” though Yamori with nostalgia. Then, he saw a few stuffed animals and plushies, some posters from bands or movies. “Sonatine, I never saw that movie, I guess who ever lived here really liked it” pursued Yamori in his head. At some point the man saw a pile of books and letters and, for some reasons, he started to dig through the works. Some Dostoevski, Mishima, Kawabata, Sartre, Marx, Primo Levi, Camus, Orwell, Lenin, plenty of essays and thesis. Yamori grabbed *No Exit* by Jean Paul Sartre and casted a careless glance at the book cover, “let’s see what’s that book about”. He opened it at the last page thinking that he would understand the whole book and read “Garcin: Hell is other people

\-Why you say that Garcin, why your name’s so funny, Garcin?” Asked Yamori to the book.

As he browsed the paged, a letter fell on the book pile below. The boy grabbed it with a hand while holding *No Exit* with the other. The letter was signed, but the hand writing was barely readable.

 

Dear \*\*\*\*\*



Whis I was \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*. Here, every day is a rainy day.

* \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* like the rain, but not here. It feels like \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

\*\*\* seemed \* \*\*\* off lately, I wish I was here, I would cheer \*\*\* \*\*.

I don’t know how much ink I have left \*\*\* \*\*\*, if only the rain was ink.

I could \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* endlessly.

Answer \*\* anything, as long as you breath, I’ll be \*\*\*\*\*\*\*.

Shi\*\*ka

 

Without thinking anything particular about the content – more about the awful handwriting, Yamori put the letter back in the book, and put the book back on the pile. He stood back up when he saw, slightly under the pillow on the bed, another letter. Like an automaton, he took it, and started reading.

 

Dear \*\*\*zuka,

 

\* \*\*\*\*\* cannot forgive myself.

Writing to you is pointless, you’re already a wind, a wave, and I am still \*\*, standing.

\* \*\*\* know if it makes me feel better or worse to write that pointless letter.

I will never forgive myself. You called me. We were \*\*\*\*less.

Now I know, you just wanted me by your side.

I failed you; I can’t bear \*\*\*\*\*\*\* anymore.

You were the one, I was the none.

You called me. \*\* were helpless. \*\*\*\* \*\*\* nothing I could do to save you, that I thought.

True.

But \*\*\*\* \*\*\*\*\* save me, was being with you,

When you sang your last note.

Now I am only a piano without strings.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* the night the sun rises, we will be again together.

If not:

Too bad.

\*\*\*\*\*

 

Chills crawled from the bottom of Yamori’s spine. “I shouldn’t be reading this” he thought. I quickly put that letter under the pillow where he found it. As he stood back up, he soon realized the room was actually filled with letters and polaroids with annotations. And, as the room was slowly filling with darkness, he realized he might have spent too much time in here. He reached the curtains, looking to let a bit of outside light enter.

In the share-house every room has a balcony with sliding glass doors. The ones from the room were covered with newspaper. Ranging from the Showa period, to Heisei, up to Reiwa. But what matters most is not the content of the newspapers, it’s rather what was painted on it.

*Here is not here.*



Yamori spent about an hour in that room, and never noticed that message on the windows. He was shivering all of a sudden. As he started turning on his feet to reach the door, a necktie dropped from the ceiling. The apparel was tied in a knot, Yamori saw it clearly and whatever was that for, it shocked the boy who fell back on the pile of book.

He realized how the room changed since he entered. The fresh smell vanished long ago, crushed under a cavernous fragrance of dust and metal. The wallpaper was torn, and the paint on the ceiling was falling. All the people on the photographs look distorted; their eyes hidden by deep shadows. The room was about to swallow Yamori.

He gathered some strength and ran to the door that became rusty and cracked. In a desperate movement he slammed opened it and got on the other side.

The hallway that was bright before he entered was now threatened by a flickering red light. Every half a second, Yamori was plunged into darkness for what felt like ages. He looked back at the room 323 door as if it would help him understand what was happening, when he realized the room number was upside down. The room door in front too. Actually, all room numbers were upside down throughout the whole hallway. But Yamori was not expecting what was standing at the end of the hallway, lurking in the darkness.

I need some input on our espresso machine. We currently have a (don’t laugh) KitchenAid semi-automatic. It’s similar to a Bambino but has a thermocoil with dual temp sensors. It’s not the best but we got it on sale before we knew of better options and it’s made good coffee for a 3.5 years now. (We followed recommendations and invested much more in the grinder.)

Starting a month or so ago, I’ve noticed a change in how the machine acts. We always start by making two coffees in the morning. I use the programmed volumetric brew, which is surprisingly accurate. I dial in the grind so that the shot runs in 30 seconds or so. No problem. I pull the second shot approximately 5 minutes later. Beans are the same, grind size is exactly the same, coffee dose is exactly the same down to 0.1g. Prep is also identical. However, recently, the second shot will often exceed 1 minute - for the exact same volumetric amount. Not using any steam during the process so not changing any settings or machine temps.

For the life of me, I cannot figure out why this has started happening. It didn’t before. Both shots would run at the same length. I can’t even think of where to start to troubleshoot - but I’m starting to be concerned that something is going on with the machine itself. It’s like the pump is loosing some “oomph” on that 2nd shot.  
    
Any ideas? I’m really stumped. I know it’s not the biggest problem in the world but it is frustrating to have such a difference in the two shots for no apparent reason. The shots look and taste completely different (crema is far darker on the 2nd, slower shot). I’m super careful with prep and feel that everything is the same with both. I’m wondering if I’m developing early issues with the machine itself but honestly don’t know what that would be. Odd thing is that the machine become pretty reliable in this odd new behavior - it always does it now, and it always takes 2x as long for the 2nd shot. Any advice/ideas would be amazingly helpful.

First off, a little bit about me - I’m moving to Wales to do an LLB at Cardiff this September, I love fun intellectual conversations, coffee/smoothie dates with friends, going to the movies, I enjoy going to the gym sometimes, I love baking and cooking, I like art, traveling, sports (like soccer and gymnastics), I’m really into video games, I really wanna try hiking, etc. 

I wanna be as optimistic as possible but the culture is a bit different where I live in the Caribbean. All I can think of is how most of the girls in the uni group chats are obsessed with partying and drinking, random hookups, etc. I’m not really a party fanatic (although I do like jazz bars, going to lunch/dinner, partying sometimes), I don’t drink often (I’ll have a cocktail here and there), and I don’t do random hookups (not that I judge girls who do, it’s just not for me). 

I also will be staying in private accommodation, so it’ll be a bit more difficult to make friends I think, since I won’t have the shared accommodation friendship experience.

If anyone feels similarly or is in the same boat as I am, let’s be friends! ",0,1748408587.0,Cardiff,2,0.29,False

A Letter I won't send

Dear _ _ _ _
  
Now that enough time has passed, I want to tell you what I’ve learned and reflected upon in the months since. 

Your love never left me. I felt your absence every single day. I felt it in every morning, in every coffee, in every social interaction, and in every breath. Despite the difficulty, I continued living my life without you. I committed to sobriety and going to therapy. I often had a lingering sense of regret that I wasn’t able to commit to this for the benefit our relationship while we still had it. 

The love we had was beautiful, special, and raw, and it changed my life. It was ours, and it will continue to be even if time passes and our feelings towards each other and the relationship change. I also know that our love could be difficult and painful. I now believe that whenever we argued, both of us just wanted to be seen and acknowledged, but we were two different souls learning how to love and understand each other. 

Somehow, somewhere along the way, when one of us expressed how we felt and the other tried to understand, the message got lost in translation. For me, when I listened, I could only hear how inadequate I was and how I had to change. I always saw it as an argument and responded accordingly, instead of seeing it as an invitation to show me how my actions hurt you. I won’t justify my actions by blaming the insecurities from my past, the way you brought up these issues, or the emotions I had. I wasn’t the person you needed me to be, and I’m sorry. I could have changed, listened, and acknowledged you, but I didn’t. 

I also want to apologize for how I treated you during and after the relationship ended. While I’ve forgiven myself, I still want to express how sorry I am for my actions and their consequences. I wasn’t honest with you or with myself, I took you for granted, and I put my comfort, my happiness, and my fears before your needs. I continued to do this even after we broke up by not respecting your boundary of no contact. It was a difficult transition, and I’m sorry for the ways I tried to beg, bargain, guilt, or pressure you back into my life. 

In those moments, I didn’t understand why you left and how you could leave me with so little to hold onto. But I know that breakups are hard– it was both of our first real relationships and one of many firsts we held together. Although I held onto anger at the ways you ended the relationship, I’ve realized that you were doing what you felt was best for you and our relationship. 

In my healing journey, one of the most important lessons I learned was letting go of the illusion of control. I can’t rewrite the past or undo my mistakes. I can’t take back the ways I hurt you, even though I now understand why I did. And I can’t change how I behaved after we broke up. Every day, I have to live with the consequences of my actions. I can only acknowledge, forgive, and learn from these experiences. 

Similarly, I can’t change the way you acted. I can’t change the reality that you broke up with me or the way you did it. In the moment, and for months after, I wanted to keep trying and fix our mistakes, but you didn’t. All I can do is acknowledge the reality of our love– from the unexpected beginning to the painful end, for all of its beauty to all of its perfect imperfections. 

The final aspect I cannot control is the ending of our story. It might have already happened. We might walk our separate paths and slowly return to becoming strangers to each other– only this time, with a shared history of love. We might return to speaking terms once we’ve healed and be friendly with each other, though never once letting our defenses down again. We might try again and fail. We might grow old together and share our lives again.

I don’t know what will happen. This uncertainty is difficult to come to terms with, but it will teach me how to live in the moment. I have to learn to accept any outcome, no matter how painful or how much I want it to happen. While I can't write this to you, I'll write to the memory i have of you; the man i used to know. 

Thank you for everything. I love you. 


As messy as this room may look, I wish it still looked the same. I wish it was messier, I wish the pile on the floor was immovable, and the mirror was too heavy for 10 people to lift. I should have opted for the portraits on the walls to be cemented rather than nailed. I wish the vanity i always hated still needed to have the drawers pulled all the way out to realign them everyday. I wish it was just as bright there now. I wish I was still just as goofy and truly smile like that again one day. I wish the things you can't see were still there despite me wishing they never were. I wish i was still 15lbs heavier, maybe then it would be harder to push me aside. I can wish a million times but a wish, by definition, is just a desire that is not easily attainable; something that cannot or probably will not happen. I wish i didn't feel as overused as a word that's been coined dozens of times to describe the paradox of the world i've been living in. Nobody's given the guidelines on how to live life properly; we learn to walk by falling... what a contradiction. Perhaps the only rule that's for certain is there are no rules.

Ms. Woods, you are not someone who easily gets pregnant. It's best to keep them,"" the doctor said tactfully, seeing Fiona come alone for the check-up and look exhausted. She was not easily pregnant, yet it happened in one go.","Ms. Woods, congratulations, you are eight weeks pregnant!""

Fiona Woods was thunderstruck. ""What?""

Was she eight weeks pregnant? How could that be?

She and Darwin Solomon had always been very careful, strictly using contraception.

Thinking back, she vaguely remembered that on Darwin's birthday two months ago, they had a brief moment of risky behavior at the beginning, but it was only once.

""Ms. Woods, you are not someone who easily gets pregnant. It's best to keep them,"" the doctor said tactfully, seeing Fiona come alone for the check-up and look exhausted.

She was not easily pregnant, yet it happened in one go.

Should she consider herself lucky or not?

Fiona felt a deep bitterness.

Coming out of the hospital, she was in a daze for a while.

Her hand holding the test results was still trembling; tears welled up, but she didn't know if she was happy or not.

Five years ago, creditors came knocking, and Fiona's grandmother was seriously ill. She urgently needed a large sum of money.

Just when she was in utter despair, she met Darwin.

It was said that she looked very much like his first love, Lilian Robbins, who was the apple of his eye.

However, Lilian had married overseas to a famous noble family when Darwin had an accident and became a vegetative state.

He must have truly loved her deeply; even after being abandoned, he couldn't let go.

After meeting Fiona, Darwin helped her settle her family's debts and arranged for the best hospital to treat her grandmother. And Fiona became his secretary in public and his lover in private.

For these five years, she hid her true self, imitating everything about Lilian, being obedient and gentle, and doing her utmost to please Darwin. She was long tired of it.

Calming down, Fiona quickly weighed the pros and cons.

She glanced at her flat belly, thinking, 'I can't give birth to them.'

Yesterday afternoon, Darwin, the president of the Atlas Group, returned from a two-week business trip. This time, he unusually didn't take Fiona with him.

Fiona thought Darwin was finally tired of her.

She was happy about it. She hoped he would quickly move on to the next one.

Unexpectedly, Darwin, after returning from his trip, couldn't even wait for her to get off work. He directly pulled her into the secretary's lounge.

After a round of lovemaking, in the lounge, her dress and Darwin's custom suit were scattered all over the place.

Darwin held her tightly from behind, planting hot kisses on her neck.

Fiona gently reminded him that the shareholders were waiting for him to start the meeting.

Darwin responded coldly, then let go of her and went straight to the bathroom.

Fiona, enduring the discomfort in her body, went to get Darwin's spare suit.

After Darwin finished his shower and changed into his suit, Fiona gently helped him with his tie.

He looked down at Fiona, who was gentle, obedient, and sensible, and he was very satisfied.

""There's a check on the table, two million dollars,"" Darwin said slowly, ""Also, the villa at Emerald Pool will be transferred to your name.""

Fiona stopped and looked at Darwin in confusion. ""Mr. Solomon, why...""

Darwin's eyes were full of contempt. He raised his hand to pinch her chin. ""It's a reward.""

Was it a reward? Or was it the rumored breakup fee?

Although Darwin had always been generous to her, he had never given so much at once.

Darwin's thumb gently rubbed Fiona's slightly swollen lips, his cold tone carrying a hint of persuasion. ""As long as you continue to be this obedient and well-behaved, I'll give you more in the future.""

Fiona looked at Darwin, puzzled.

Didn't he plan to break up with her?

Fiona put on a demure and charming look, nodding lightly. ""Mr. Solomon, I understand.""

After she responded, the irritation on Darwin's face instantly disappeared.

He nodded slightly. ""Go home this afternoon.""

Fiona nodded.

Darwin left directly.

After he left, Fiona picked up the check, her beautiful eyebrows tightly furrowed, recalling the news push she saw on her phone in the morning.

\[Breaking News! the Atlas Group's president to get engaged to the daughter of the century-old Ross family. The union of two powerful financial families may bring significant changes to the global capital landscape.\]

Fiona gently rubbed her forehead, laughing helplessly. 'Is this the reason Darwin suddenly gave her two million dollars and a villa? To let her continue being his obedient bedmate, the third party in his marriage?'

Her stomach churned.

She rushed to the bathroom, retching.

Fiona looked up at the mirror, seeing her pale and somewhat disheveled self.

Darwin was truly a bastard. He was about to get married, yet he couldn't let go of Lilian and still clung to her, the substitute.

Fiona had even accidentally seen a girl who looked more like Lilian than herself by Darwin's side.

She thought, 'This substitute, whoever wants to be it can be it. Screw this!'

Fiona left the company and went straight to Darwin's house.

Most of the time, Darwin would be with her at the place he arranged for her or in the secretary's lounge.

Fiona didn't come there often, and she didn't have many things.

She packed carefully, making sure she hadn't left anything behind before she felt at ease to leave.

Then, she returned to her apartment. She began organizing her work notes and some tasks that needed to be handed over and preparing her resignation letter.

The handover of the secretary's work wasn't a big issue. The troublesome part was a large infrastructure project she had been responsible for following up on last year. It was her first time handling such a big project, and she had put in a lot of effort. Now, quitting halfway, she was worried it might affect the project's progress.

A sleepless night and yesterday's dry heaving made Fiona a bit uneasy.

Her best friend, Thalassa Carey, who had returned from studying abroad, also insisted that Fiona looked too frail and had repeatedly urged her to get a check-up.

Finally, Fiona decided to take half a day off to queue at the hospital for a check-up. She then received the dreadful news that she was eight weeks pregnant.

Fiona composed herself and returned to the company with her prepared resignation letter, heading to the CEO's office.

Just as she was about to knock on the door, she heard the teasing voice of Darwin's friend, Wyatt Durham, from inside. ""Darwin, you're getting married. What are you going to do about Ms. Woods?""

Inside, there was a brief moment of silence, followed by Darwin's cold voice. ""Nothing, business as usual.""

""She's willing to be your mistress?"" Wyatt asked.

""If you pay enough, why wouldn't she be?"" Darwin's tone was full of mockery and disdain.

Fiona stood there, her heart aching sharply. She had initially sold herself to Darwin, and in the end, in Darwin's eyes, she was just a commodity that could be renewed for play if the price was right.

""Really?"" Wyatt's voice suddenly became high-pitched with excitement. ""So, if I offer a higher price than you, would she sell herself to me?""

Just as Wyatt finished speaking, Darwin's assistant, Henry Clark, called out from outside the door. ""Ms. Woods?""

Fiona turned and nodded at Henry, then knocked on the office door and walked in.

Wyatt fell silent.

Then, he squinted his charming eyes and greeted her with a warm smile, ""Hello, Ms. Woods.""

Fiona felt disgusted by his earlier words and ignored him. She walked straight to Darwin, who looked at her coldly and with obvious displeasure in his eyes.

""Mr. Solomon."" Fiona looked at Darwin. She didn't want to pretend to be gentle and obedient for another second.

She handed over her resignation letter with dignity. ""This is my resignation letter.""

Darwin looked at her coldly. ""What do you mean?""

""Five years ago, we agreed that I wouldn't be a mistress. If you got married, I would leave."" Fiona put down the resignation letter. ""I will hand over my work and unfinished projects as soon as possible. I won't disturb you and Mr. Durham any longer.""

After speaking, she turned and walked out.

As she passed the astonished Wyatt, she stopped.

She looked at Wyatt coldly and firmly answered his earlier question, ""I won't sell.""

By the time Wyatt came to his senses, Fiona was already gone.

Wyatt looked at Darwin in shock. ""Was she your delicate 'Ms. Woods'?"" Darwin stood up, radiating anger, and strode out.

There was a hint of panic and confusion in his eyes that he hadn't even noticed.

He definitely remembered the agreement he had with Fiona. Over the years, she had been completely obedient to him, no matter how outrageous his demands were, so he never thought that his getting married would actually make Fiona leave.

Fiona didn't like to drag things out. She returned to the secretary's office and immediately began the handover process.

However, as she turned around, she saw Darwin, full of coldness, following her in.

""Mr. Solomon, is there anything else you need to explain?"" Fiona looked at him, no longer gentle and obedient.

Darwin's face became gloomy even more. ""Fiona, haven't I been good enough to you? What are you making a fuss about?""

He stepped closer to Fiona, exuding a strong sense of oppression.

Fiona's face turned a bit pale. She instinctively took a step back, trying to distance herself from Darwin.

However, Darwin stepped forward and grabbed her wrist, pulling her back in front of him.

""Mr. Solomon, you get married, then I leave. This was our agreement five years ago,"" Fiona said in a low voice.

Darwin sneered, ""So, twenty million dollars and that villa aren't enough, right?""

Fiona's body stiffened. She thought of what Darwin had said earlier that if he paid enough, she wouldn't refuse to be; her stomach churned again.

She struggled hard to free her arm, wanting to escape from this man who humiliated and trampled on her. ""Darwin, let go of me!""

""Fiona, stop playing hard to get. Just name your price."" Darwin's tone was icy, and he gripped Fiona's wrist so tightly it seemed he might break it.

Fiona gave a bitter smile.

Even now, Darwin thought she wanted to leave because he hadn't paid enough. Just like in the beginning, Fiona didn't want to sell herself. But later, when the money was sufficient, she obediently climbed into his bed and let him play with her. So, it must be that the money wasn't enough. She couldn't possibly want to leave him.

Fiona looked at Darwin. Over the years, she had always been clear-headed, remembering that she was just a stand-in. All of Darwin's tenderness and affection were for someone else, not her. If she had indulged even a little, she would be utterly devastated and in unbearable pain right now. Fortunately, she had guarded her heart and hadn't lost herself.

""Darwin, I'm done with this! Do you understand?"" Fiona glared at him angrily. ""My mother was driven to death by a mistress. I would rather die than be one.""Inside the secretary's office, a brief silence fell.

Darwin was stunned and realized that Fiona was indeed serious about leaving him.

""You haven't visited your grandmother in a long time. I'll give you a month's leave. Think it over before you decide,"" he said, suppressing his anger and softening his tone.

Fiona calmed down instantly.

Then, she became even more resolute and determined. ""No need to think it over. I've already decided.""

""Fiona!"" Darwin could no longer contain his anger.

Fiona was truly ungrateful! He had lowered himself and given her enough leeway!

He added, ""You're just a stand-in for Lilian. I've used you for five years and gotten used to it. Do you really think I can't live without you?""

He was just used to it. He was too lazy to adapt to another stand-in.

""Mr. Solomon, I am well aware of my position and dare not have any extravagant hopes,"" Fiona replied coldly.

""Very well!"" Darwin nodded, returning to his usual icy demeanor, and released Fiona's wrist.

""Fiona, you're not the most like Lilian; you're just more obedient than anyone else,"" he said coldly, looking at Fiona. ""Since you've made up your mind, so be it.""

""Thank you, Mr. Solomon,"" Fiona replied calmly, suppressing the inexplicable pain in her heart. ""I will hand over all my work properly and won't cause you any trouble.""

""The secretary's work doesn't need to be handed over to anyone else. There will be a new secretary. Teach her well before you leave.""

""Yes.""

Darwin left indifferently without looking back.

For him, the brief attempt to retain her was only because she played the role of Lilian so well and was so obedient.

Now that she was defying him, he had lost his patience and would not bother her anymore.

Fiona glanced at her reddened wrist and then at his departing figure.

She was finally free, breaking away from the man who had humiliated and trampled on her.

The news of Fiona's resignation quickly spread, though no one knew who leaked it.

Everyone knew that the difficult Darwin could only be handled by Fiona.

The next morning, the new secretary, who was replacing Fiona, Bella Robbins, arrived.

Henry directly placed her in Fiona's office.

Everyone was shocked, and even more so by the fact that the new secretary bore a five or six-point resemblance to Fiona.

Originally, the company was abuzz with gossip about Darwin and Fiona's relationship. Now that she had resigned and someone so similar to her had arrived, the rumors only intensified, with all sorts of theories circulating.

Darwin went to a meeting with the overseas project team as soon as he arrived at work.

By the time the meeting ended, it was already noon.

As soon as he returned to the CEO's office, Bella came in looking aggrieved. ""Darwin, I took Ms. Woods' place. Is she unhappy, and that's why she won't come to teach me?""

Darwin frowned and looked at Henry. ""Where is Fiona?""

Henry was taken aback and glanced at Bella.

""Mr. Solomon, Ms. Woods has some family matters to attend to and has taken leave to go back home,"" he quickly said, ""It's my fault. I was busy preparing for the meeting this morning and forgot to inform you.""

""Family matters? She left so urgently that she didn't even have time to inform Darwin. It must be serious, right?"" Bella said with a concerned look.

Darwin instinctively walked towards his desk and opened a file, putting some distance between them. ""She's not here. Come back when she returns.""

Bella, who was naturally good at reading people, noticed that Darwin was in a bad mood.

She pouted a bit but didn't linger and left the CEO's office.

As she glanced at the secretary's office, her expression darkened, and she gritted her teeth.

She thought, 'Fiona, just you wait! How dare you deliberately make things difficult for me! What urgent matter? It's obvious you're just trying to give me a hard time! Fiona, you started this, and today's incident is far from over!'

""Mr. Solomon, at 3 p.m., you have a golf appointment with Mr. Wallace from Oberlin Construction,"" Henry reported Darwin's schedule as usual.

Out of the corner of his eye, Darwin took a sip of freshly brewed coffee, and his face visibly became gloomy with anger.

He ordered, ""Call Fiona and tell her to come back immediately to hand over her work!""

Everyone else in the CEO's office was useless; they couldn't even make a decent cup of coffee!

""Yes, Mr. Solomon!"" Henry immediately took out his phone.

Darwin raised an eyebrow and glanced at him, feeling even more irritated.

Fiona had probably gone back because her grandmother's health had deteriorated. It seemed she hadn't visited in over six months.

""Forget it,"" Darwin said impatiently, pushing the coffee aside and picking up a document, his face gloomy and brooding.

Henry held his phone, not daring to make a sound.

In Serene City, a light drizzle was falling.

Fiona bought a bouquet of roses, a bunch of purple daisies, and two bottles of good wine. She called a cab and headed to West Mountain Cemetery.

The caretaker saw Fiona from a distance and ran over with an umbrella. ""Fiona, it's not the usual time. What brings you here?""

""Just came to visit,"" Fiona replied politely.

After a brief exchange, she left one bottle of wine with the caretaker and walked alone into the depths of the cemetery with her umbrella.

The caretaker, holding the wine, looked at her slender figure with pity.

""Is she your relative?"" asked a cleaning lady nearby.

The caretaker shook his head and sighed. ""She's had a tough life. When she was four or five, she brought her mother here. When she was about ten, she brought her grandfather. And just half a year ago, she brought her grandmother. On the day of the burial, she knelt there all day without having food.""

Fiona, familiar with the way, found the tombstone.

Her grandparents were buried together, and her mother was next to them.

She placed the roses for her grandparents.

Her grandfather used to buy a rose for her grandmother every day when he was alive.

The purple daisies were her mother's favorite flowers.

Finally, Fiona poured a glass of wine for her grandfather.

She said, ""Grandma, Grandpa, Mom, I came back this time because I have something to tell you. I'm pregnant. Technically, I shouldn't keep this child. But you're all gone, and I have no family left in this world. This child is my only blood relative.""

Fiona took a deep breath as if making a monumental decision. ""The doctor said it would be difficult for me to conceive, so I've decided to keep the baby!""

After a pause, she smiled and said, ""You must bless them to be born healthy and grow up strong!""",1,1748408144.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False
1kx8lrb,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/1kx8lrb/guiltquestions_about_pay_when_caring_for_a/,Guilt/questions about pay when caring for a grandparent,"Potentially unconventional situation, long explanation:
I provide care assistance for my grandparent (90). They’re in an assisted living apartment- receiving meds, breakfast, lunch, and weekly cleaning assistance from staff there. Spouse passed 2 years ago at 94 after 5 years in memory care on a different floor of the same building. My grandparent needs extra care because they struggle with decreased mobility and balance, dementia, macular degeneration, and bad anxiety. 

I spend generally 3-5 hrs a day with them 5 days a week. This is paid time. I help grandparent write a check weekly for my time at an agreed upon hourly rate as well as any shopping I’ve done for them. We drink coffee, talk, and read the newspaper together at their request. While I am there I do cleaning tasks around the apartment as they’ve become increasingly messy with cognitive and physical decline. 

Every paid day I clean a variety of spilled food and bodily fluids on their kitchen surfaces, dining area, mobility aid, bed, carpet, and bathroom- providing trash removal as well. My cleaning is frequently interrupted with the request for me to sit with them. 

In addition to tidying up and companionship, I assist with laundry as needed, biweekly bathing and lotion, home manicure/pedicure, help with zippers buttons and socks when dressing, picking out clothes, etc. I schedule and attend appointments, write greeting cards that she signs, facilitate exercise and outings- providing safe transportation, encourage hydration and meal consumption all within paid time.

Some days my grandparent feels they need to rest in bed. More regularly now they will ask me to lay down with them. I take no issue with this as I understand they are feeling lonely in this late stage of aging.

Since my work time has been more fully occupied with keeping things tidy and cheerful, I’ve been having a harder time fitting their shopping and errands into it. Lately, they’ll say things like “don’t leave me” and frequently speak of death being near. There has been notable increased decline in the last year, but all checkups are still within the range of healthy expected for their age.

I have been fielding a lot more calls and texts regarding grandparent’s health scares and other scheduling needs during my free time. Talking to various doctors and communicating with their 3 children age 60-70 via call and group text. They all live nearby as well- working varying degrees of part time and living active, social, partially retired lifestyles including travel.

My grandparent’s kids try not to take overlapping trips anymore. We used to all travel together as an extended family. My mother enjoys taking trips with my partner, my son and I biannually. My grandparent has recently told me on multiple occasions that they are no longer okay with me leaving for longer than 3 days time to travel. They need me there. This is hard, but I understand after researching various symptoms they experience that lifespan is likely 6mo-1yr at this point.

On days when grandparent is not doing well, I feel guilty about having them write the check. It’s weirdly transactional and sometimes it gets put off a day or three when other things come up- as I’ve mentioned there is lots to get done within my time there and grandparent is very emotionally needy. 

I am the only grandchild involved as my cousins are all living further away and are more career driven, while I am a more natural caregiver type who has previously worked customer service jobs. I quit my part time job in August to better cater to my grandparent’s needs while keeping some of my sanity.

I think with recent increases in demand for care given, I am experiencing some burnout and may need to discuss with my mother, aunt, and uncle an adjustment in pay. I don’t enjoy the overwhelm of financial pressure mixed in with the already challenging feelings of my grandparent who I care deeply for dying.

I feel as though it may be good to switch to a different system rather than check writing for my wage- potentially a set weekly salary auto-paid from her bank account so she only has to reimburse me for shopping done.

Any advice appreciated.

1kx8lpi,https://i.redd.it/ydajvh1zeg3f1.jpeg,The Last Day of My Rite Aid Pharmacy Before Permanent Closure,"I've been a pharmacy tech at Rite Aid since the fall of 2021. Back then, the place still had a pulse. I remember when Heyward Donigan, our CEO at the time, started rolling out these “Stores of the Future” and talking up this RxRevolution like she was unveiling the cure for old age. The idea was to blend traditional and western medicine at the pharmacy counter, her big pitch for the future. Most of the pharmacists just thought it was a waste of money. To be honest, it was. All we got were new uniforms, some over-designed signage, and a logo that looked like it belonged on a toothpaste tube. Corporate burned millions rebranding everything, and all it did was make the higher-ups feel like they’d done something important.  

Despite all the chaos above my pay grade, I liked my job. The regulars who came in for their meds were decent people. The staff felt like family, especially Bob, our pharmacy manager. He was in his sixties, with a white mustache and this jolly way of telling bad jokes while counting pills. Sometimes it felt like we were the only steady thing in the neighborhood. But even then, I could sense something underneath the surface, a kind of rot.  

It started with the earnings reports. Every quarter was worse than the last, no matter how much the CEO tried to spin it. Then Donigan quit out of nowhere. We all knew she was just the first rat off the sinking ship. The next CEO, Busy Burr, didn’t even unpack before Jeffrey Stein came in. He was a bankruptcy guy, one of those suits who comes in, cuts everything to the bone, and walks off with a fat bonus. Stein didn’t care about the stores, or the people. He just wanted his $20 million and a clean exit.  

By the time the company crawled out of bankruptcy in fall 2024, there was nothing left. The shelves were empty. I used to watch the front-end staff try to flex the few items we had, turning them sideways, spreading them out, trying to hide the gaps. But you can’t hide a void like that. Customers stopped coming. Those who still needed their prescriptions started transferring them out. The shipments got slower and slower until we were lucky to get a box a week.  

Today is our last day. The breakroom smells like old coffee and cardboard. The lights flicker even more than usual, but maintenance stopped showing up months ago. I’m standing behind the counter, watching the clock, feeling the slow creep of dread in my chest. We’re ghosts already, just waiting for the doors to lock behind us.  

Bob came in this morning, moving slower than usual. He looked at the shelves and just shook his head. There’s nothing left to say. We’re all being replaced, thrown away like empty pill bottles, while the C-suite and their consultants pick apart the company’s bones for whatever cash is left.   

It’s the little things that hurt the most. The sound of the receipt printer, once a constant hum, is gone. The pharmacy phone barely rings. I realize I’ll never see the regulars again, the old lady who always brought in hard candies, the young dad who joked about baby-proofing his house. They’re gone, scattered to other stores, other routines.  

I keep expecting to feel relief, like I’m waking from a nightmare. But it’s more like falling into one. As the sun sets, the shadows in the aisles stretch out, long and thin. The place feels colder, as if the heat’s already been turned off.  

I step out from behind the counter to take one last walk through the aisles. Every footstep echoes. I swear I hear voices behind me, just out of sight, but when I turn, there’s nothing, just the empty shelves and the dust. I run my hand along the cold metal, remembering when these aisles were full and alive. Now, every corner feels wrong. Like the store itself is holding its breath, waiting for something to finally put it out of its misery.  

I don’t know if it’s just exhaustion, or the way the dying fluorescent lights play tricks on the mind, but I keep catching glimpses of movement out of the corner of my eye. A shadow where there shouldn’t be one. The heavy hush of a store that’s been stripped of everything but memory. I wonder if the building remembers all the people who passed through, if it feels the loss the way I do.  

At closing time, Bob locks up for the last time. The key turns heavy and slow in his hand. I linger by the doors, staring out into the empty parking lot, the sky bruised and dark. There’s no ceremony, no send-off. Just the silence of a place that’s been hollowed out, picked clean by greed and neglect.  

I leave my badge on the counter. As I walk out, I look back one last time. For a split second, I swear I see someone standing at the far end of the pharmacy, someone watching, impossibly still, where the shadows are thickest. But when I blink, the figure is gone, and all that’s left is the cold, unblinking stare of the empty store.  

They say places can’t haunt, only people who have passed away can. But I’m not so sure. Some ghosts are made of memories, and some are made of everything you’ve lost and can’t ever get back.

1kx8hzb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Invisalign/comments/1kx8hzb/my_lifestyle_works_well_with_my_invisalign_journey/,My lifestyle works well with my Invisalign journey,"Mind you I’m only on tray set #5, but so far, so good.

I see a lot of posts about how many times you “should” brush and floss a day. But I’ve been vegan for 5 years or so, and before Invisalign my breakfast has been coffee and a vegan protein shake, Orgain brand. I’ll slowly nurse more coffee all morning at work until around lunch time. For lunch during my work week,I exclusively drink one premade Soylent meal replacement and then drink a half gallon of water until I get home. I’ll have a substantial vegan meal at home and continue to drink water, mostly flavored, the rest of the night. My indulgence is my nightly 3 Oreo Double Stuff cookies. 
And pre-Invisalign, I brushed in the morning, and brushed and Water Pik before bed. My bottom teeth are so crowded it’s hard and painful to floss, so Water Pik works great, plus my dentist says I do a great job on it.

Now, with Invisalign, I pretty much have the same exact schedule. Changes are the coffee I nurse all morning is iced and drunk through a straw. My Soylent is also drunk thru a straw, and I swirl water in my mouth while drinking both. Trays in all day while doing this. I take them out for dinner and my Oreos, wait 30 minutes, then brush and Water Pik. Trays in until morning, when I take trays out to drink a big mug of hot coffee and my Orgain protein shake, then brush and trays back in for the day. 

It’s been pretty easy, overall. Drinking my lunch with a straw is IDEAL. One other big change is I don’t snack AT ALL during the day anymore. I just don’t wanna take my trays out and have to brush after. Who’s got time for that?!?!
Because I swirl with water all morning and at lunch, I am drinking way more than a half gallon of water.

More hydration and no snacking, I think I am WINNING at this!!

If you want to simplify your life and gain more time in your day, try this method. Works for me.

Also, thanks y’all for some really good advice in here, it’s been very helpful 🙏❤️",1,1748407752.0,Invisalign,1,0.6,False

Twenty minutes later, Chloe stared at the stamped marriage certificate in disbelief. Apparently, the rich really could do whatever they wanted.

Chloe Clark had been hanging out at the City Hall entrance with her driver's license for what felt like forever—two hours to be exact. As she watched the clouds roll in, she couldn't shake off the nerves.

Yesterday, her grandma, Cassidy Clark, had been on her case, reminding her over and over that the guy she was marrying today was the grandson of her best friend. She kept telling Chloe to be careful.

Seeing Cassidy lying there in the hospital bed, still worrying about her marriage, Chloe just couldn't say no.

So here she was, about to marry a guy she'd never even met. It felt like one of those old-school arranged marriages, and she couldn't help but feel like she was diving in blind.

Just as the first raindrops started to fall, a flashy Maybach pulled up at the entrance.

Chloe clutched her bag, feeling her heart race.

The car door swung open, and out stepped an elderly man.

Chloe's first instinct was to bolt, and she did. She hadn't expected the guy to be old enough to be her grandpa.

""Are you Ms. Clark?"" A deep voice with a hint of amusement called out behind her.

Chloe stopped in her tracks and awkwardly turned around. ""Sir, I don't think we're a good match.""

The elderly man, Zane Griffin, chuckled, realizing Chloe had misunderstood. ""Ms. Clark, you've got it all wrong. I'm here on behalf of my employer, Mr. Taylor, to handle the marriage registration.""

Chloe was floored. Could someone else really handle a marriage registration? Didn't both people need to be there?

Twenty minutes later, Chloe stared at the stamped marriage certificate in disbelief. Apparently, the rich really could do whatever they wanted. She held the certificate, still trying to wrap her head around it.

Along with the certificate, there was a composite photo of her and her new husband. They looked more like they were getting divorced than married.

""Ms. Clark, Mr. Taylor is abroad and couldn't make it. As an apology, here's a card for you. You can spend the money inside however you like,"" Zane said with a smile, handing her a card.

Chloe looked at the card, feeling weird, like she had just sold herself for money.

""Did Mr. Taylor agree to this marriage voluntarily?"" she asked, hesitating.

Zane smiled, ""Of course. Mr. Taylor instructed me to give you this card. Ms. Clark, if you need anything, feel free to contact me. I won't keep you any longer. Goodbye.""

Chloe left City Hall in a daze. It was raining now, and the Maybach was long gone.

Standing under the eaves to avoid the rain, Chloe opened the marriage certificate and examined it closely.

She murmured the name on it, ""Luke Taylor.""

Yep, it was the grandson of her grandma's friend, Donna Taylor. But Cassidy never told her that Donna's family was so wealthy!

Looking at the photo, Luke's handsome and striking features were hard to miss. He was probably even better-looking in person. Too bad she hadn't met him, and now he was her husband in name only. It was surreal.

Chloe took a deep breath, put away the marriage certificate, and dashed into the rain.

She thought Luke would reach out soon, but three months went by without a word from him.

At first, she had hoped to build a good life with Luke, but as time passed, she gave up on that idea. Day after day of waiting turned into disappointment, and eventually, she forgot about Luke and stopped hoping for a peaceful life with him.

A year flew by in no time. Chloe had climbed the ladder from a small-time copywriter at a branch of the Harrison Group to the PR department at the headquarters. Just two weeks ago, she got promoted to manager of the first PR department.

The Harrison Group, which started in electronics, was now a giant in the industry, with businesses all over the globe. Today was the big industry summit, and as the PR manager, Chloe had to be there.

Dressed in a starry-themed strapless gown, Chloe looked stunning, lighting up the grand conference hall. She caught the eye of many men.

After fending off yet another admirer, her colleague, Samantha Wilson, came over with a glass of wine and teased, ""Chloe, you're a knockout. The way you attract men is unreal.""

""Cut it out,"" Chloe playfully glared at Samantha.

""By the way, I sent the speech to your planning department. Are you all set?"" Chloe asked, frowning a bit.

""Relax, Chloe. We've been ready for ages. Just wait and see, you'll blow everyone away on stage,"" Samantha smiled, giving her a reassuring nod.

Tonight, the big shots from various industries were here, and Chloe couldn't afford any slip-ups. The summit was organized by the Harrison Group's planning and PR departments, and if anything went wrong, her new director position could be in jeopardy.

Chloe felt a bit uneasy all night. She and Samantha sat in the front row on the far left. After a while, the host announced the start of the meeting, and representatives from various industries took the stage to speak.

""Next, let's welcome Mr. Harrison, the CEO of the Harrison Group, to share his insights on the future applications and development of the electronics industry. Please give him a warm round of applause,"" the host's clear and powerful voice echoed through the room.

Vincent Harrison, the CEO of the Harrison Group, had always been abroad. People in the industry thought he had been excluded by the Harrison Family. No one expected him to return in such a high-profile manner.

The lights in the conference hall dimmed, and a spotlight shone on the center of the stage. A man walked slowly from behind the scenes.

""Oh my God, when did Mr. Harrison come back? This is huge news. How come we didn't know?"" Samantha looked excitedly at Vincent on stage and then asked Chloe, ""Didn't the PR department know? Why didn't you tell me?""

Chloe shook her head, just as confused. ""I had no idea either.""

Chloe watched Vincent walk to the center of the stage, stunned. She was supposed to be the spokesperson for the Harrison Group. How had it become Vincent?

Looking at Vincent's handsome and charming face, Chloe suddenly felt a strange familiarity, but she couldn't place where she had seen him before.

Vincent's deep, magnetic voice was soothing and pleasant to listen to.

""Are you stunned? Mr. Harrison's high-profile return is really unexpected. Did you hear what he said?"" Samantha nudged Chloe.

Chloe shook her head. She had been too focused on Vincent's face to catch what he said.

""I feel like he looks familiar, like I've seen him somewhere before,"" Chloe murmured.

Samantha laughed, ""Every single woman says Mr. Harrison looks familiar. I didn't expect a married woman like you to be infatuated with him, too?""

Chloe stayed quiet, genuinely feeling he looked familiar.

# News

Vincent's speech on stage was just background noise to Chloe. She was too busy trying to figure out where she'd seen his face before. Eventually, she just gave up.

Chloe thought the summit would wrap up without a hitch, but boy, was she wrong. Just as Vincent finished his speech and stepped off the stage, some guy rushed at him with a bucket of red paint.

The guy yelled, ""Vincent, go to hell!""

Vincent happened to walk over to Chloe's side. She was so stunned by the sudden chaos that her mind went blank. Without thinking, she jumped in front of Vincent and grabbed onto him.

The paint splashed all over her, leaving Vincent spotless.

The place went nuts. Vincent's assistant immediately called for security to tackle the attacker.

The crowd was in a frenzy, and Chloe, still clinging to Vincent, felt sticky and super uncomfortable.

Vincent looked down at Chloe, surprised she had shielded him.

His usually cold eyes softened a bit as he asked, ""You okay?""

Chloe looked up and managed to say, ""I'm fine.""

Vincent stared at Chloe's face, thinking she looked oddly familiar. Her actions made him feel a bit of goodwill. He quickly took off his coat and draped it over her.

Then he turned to his assistant, Leo Davis, with a stern look and said, ""Take that guy to the police.""

Chloe couldn't understand how a madman had managed to get into the venue. She was sure her boss would chew her out for this mess.

The summit was put on hold because of the attack, and Chloe was taken to the lounge with Vincent and his team amidst the chaos.

Vincent was really grateful for what Chloe did. Back in the lounge, he looked at the paint-covered Chloe and asked, ""What's your name? Do you work for the Harrison Group?""

Chloe nodded and said, ""Yes, Mr. Harrison. I'm Chloe Clark, the manager of the PR department.""

Vincent thought her name sounded familiar but couldn't place it, so he let it go.

He pointed to the bathroom and offered, ""You can clean up in there. I'll have someone bring you some clothes.""

Chloe suddenly felt a sense of goodwill towards Vincent. He didn't seem as scary as the rumors made him out to be; he actually seemed pretty nice.

As soon as Chloe went into the bathroom, Vincent's demeanor changed. He called Leo over immediately.

""What the hell happened?"" Vincent asked harshly.

Leo quickly explained, ""Mr. Harrison, it was a former employee you fired. He heard you were back in the country and wanted revenge, so he came to the summit.""

Vincent glared at Leo, who shivered in fear. Leo added, ""Mr. Harrison, I just got back with you. It's been tough to find out even this much.""

Vincent asked, ""Who was in charge of this summit?""

""The PR manager and the planning manager of the Harrison Group,"" Leo replied right away.

""Bring them to me,"" Vincent said, his face dark with anger.

Soon enough, Samantha got called to the lounge. Vincent hadn't even returned to the office yet but needed to handle this matter immediately. He needed answers about why security and planning had been so lousy while he was away.

Samantha stood there, shaking. Vincent barked, ""Wasn't the PR department involved too? Where are they?""

Leo, looking pained, said, ""The PR manager is Chloe Clark. Weirdly, we can't find her anywhere. No clue where she went.""

Vincent glanced at the bathroom. Could Chloe be the one in there?

Finally, Vincent waved his hand in frustration, dismissing everyone. ""Forget it, we'll handle this back at the office.""

Samantha, who had been called in just to be dismissed, felt like she was on an emotional rollercoaster.

She immediately called Chloe, not knowing where she had disappeared to in the chaos. All she remembered was a splash of red and everyone freaking out.

At that moment, Chloe's phone was in Vincent's hand. He saw the call but ignored it, tossing the phone onto the coffee table.

Soon, hotel staff brought clothes for Chloe. Vincent knocked on the bathroom door and said, ""The clothes are here. I'm leaving now.""

Chloe, startled, replied, ""Okay.""

By the next day, everything had settled. Chloe and Samantha stood respectfully in the office.

The paint-splashing incident at the summit had made front-page news for the Harrison Group.

Along with the news was Chloe, and the story spread like wildfire. Overnight, reporters and curious netizens spun a romantic tale of a brave subordinate saving a domineering CEO.

The story got more scandalous, causing a stir within the company. Rumors flew that Chloe had hired someone to splash paint on Vincent to get in his good graces.

Vincent threw a tablet heavily in front of Chloe and Samantha. The bold red headline and the image of Chloe hugging Vincent with her back to the camera were glaringly displayed.

Samantha silently gave Chloe a thumbs-up, thinking, 'Chloe, you're something else!'

Chloe was on the verge of tears. She quickly explained, ""Mr. Harrison, I can issue a statement. It's not what they think. These people are just making stuff up.""

Leo, standing nearby, snorted, ""Mr. Harrison knows it's nonsense. We want to know how the PR department plans to handle this.""

Leo knew the truth. The reporters' headlines were ridiculous. The whole hero-saving-the-boss and seducing-the-CEO narrative was completely false.

Vincent's eyes were cold as he looked at Chloe and Samantha. ""Have you thought about how to fix this? How will you explain this to me?""

Samantha lowered her head even more, and Chloe also hung her head in resignation. She had thought everything would go smoothly, but things had gone wrong, and Vincent's reputation had taken a hit.

1kx8dpy,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComfyChairs/comments/1kx8dpy/can_i_clean_leather_chairs_with_vinegar/,Can I clean leather chairs with vinegar?,"Samantha had always been proud of her cozy reading nook, especially the two vintage leather chairs she’d found at a local thrift shop. They were a rich, caramel brown—worn in just enough to be comfortable, but still holding onto their classic charm. But after a few months of coffee spills, cat naps, and the occasional dust build-up, the leather started looking dull and a bit grimy.

One Saturday morning, determined to freshen things up, Samantha went searching online for cleaning tips. That’s when she stumbled upon a thread in a home-care forum where people shared their go-to methods for cleaning leather. One user swore by using a simple mixture of vinegar and water—equal parts of each—applied with a soft cloth. Curious and always up for a DIY solution, Samantha decided to give it a try.

She mixed the solution in a spray bottle and gave it a good shake. Testing it first on a small, inconspicuous spot at the back of one chair, she gently wiped the area with a microfiber cloth dampened (not soaked) with the mixture. After letting it dry for a few minutes, she checked the spot. No discoloration, no stickiness—just cleaner-looking leather. Encouraged, she went ahead and did the rest of the chairs, working in sections and wiping with a dry cloth afterward to remove any leftover moisture.

The results surprised her. The leather looked refreshed and had a subtle, healthy sheen. The smell of vinegar faded quickly, and the chairs looked cleaner without losing any of their natural texture. She later followed up with a leather conditioner, which someone else had suggested in the forum, to keep the leather from drying out.

Samantha was glad she did a bit of research and took a cautious approach. She learned that while vinegar can be used on leather, it should always be diluted and applied carefully, and it’s best to finish with a conditioner to preserve the leather’s softness and prevent cracking.

So in the end, yes—you can clean leather chairs with vinegar, but it pays to be gentle, test first, and follow up with care. Samantha’s reading nook now felt like new again, and her vintage chairs looked better than ever.",1,1748407338.0,ComfyChairs,0,1.0,False

This is my very short itinerary -

Day 1: Delhi to Manali with my Bike
- I did a test run to the starting point to see if I can park my own vehicle.
- There were lots of cafes near the starting point with parking facilities, so it wasn't a problem.
- If you are going via your own vehicle then you will need a Hampta Pass permit from [Hampta Pass Permit](https://rohtangpermits.nic.in/)

Day 2: Manali to Starting point (Allain Barrage)
- Parked my vehicle
- Had Breakfast
- Started the trek
- Reached Chika in 4 hours, covering 4.5 km
- Setup a camp there and cooked my own food.

Note: There is a shop in Chika, so you don't need to bring food for that day. And next day breakfast and you can have lunch & dinner packed for next day as well. I wasn't aware so I brought my own food.

Day 3: Chika to Balu ka Ghera
- It was very stressful hike for me. It took me almost 11 hours to cover 9 km.
- I was stuck in a river crossing for almost more than an hour.
- Leave early to reach on time. I reached at 8:30 pm and it was night and not recommended.
- You can stop at Jwara if you want too. Jwara is around 2 hours from Balu ka Ghera.

Day 4: Balu ka Ghera to Hampta Pass Summit and back
- I left at 7 am in the morning and keft my tent and rucksack in the balu ka ghera.
- I reached the summit in 6 hours. I lost so many times and was stuck but in the end found the way to summit. It was very dangerous and steep climb.
- I returned after soending half an hour on the summit as rain clouds were coming 
- I reached back to Base Camp site in 4 hours.
- I wanted to push to Jwara, but it was so tiring I slept after cooking noodles with soup.

Day 5: Balu ka Ghera to Starting Point where I parked my bike.
- It was a very easy downhill hike
- It took me 8 hours to complete 14 km
- it was a fun day, I met lots of fellow trekkers at chika shop and I shared my story, food and stuff that I would not use now with them. It was a really good experience.


Questions ==================
Q.1 Do we need permit for this trek?
Ans: Yes, to camp in the Inderkilla national park, you need a permit from the forest department. However if you are solo they won't grant you a permit. So best option is to just start trekking without the permit. There is no checking.

Q.2 What about water?
Ans: There are plenty of water stream throughout the trail. Just bring purification tablets with you.

Q.3 What about food?
Ans: I packed so much food that I gave all of them to Chika shop owner on my return journey. Please pack smart.
Day 1: Breakfast at starting point and get some snacks and drinks like frooti. When you reach Chika, setup your camp and eat lunch and dinner from the shop.
Day 2: Eat breakfast at Chika shop and have lunch and dinner packed for this day.
Day 3: Summit day. You need food for this day only. Soup and noodles shoukd be enough.
Day 4: Soup, Tea/Coffee and start descending. Eat lunch at Chika shop. Eat dinner at starting point or at manali.

Q.4 Difficulty?
For me it was hard because I had to navigate and find the trail myself. I lost so many times.

You can watch my [instagram reel](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DKENQgEu7SJ/?igsh=czNkbHhoNHl0ODN5) of the summit day to get an idea how much snow was there.

Please pack light. My rucksack was 20 kg. Pack more socks because of river crossing you might end up getting them wet if you didn't remove your shoes. It's hard to cross rivers without shoes, so i didn't remove them.
Be mentally prepared!

1kx84df,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kx84df,Reposting since I clearly missed the mark… check out a brand new flea market!,"Freak Out Parties & Events, est. May 2024, is growing! In addition to monthly indoor markets, we are excited to debut our brand new flea market this Saturday, May 31st. Created from a love for planning parties and an unhappy vending experience, Freak Out strives to create affordable, accessible, and welcoming opportunities for small businesses of all kinds. We've had a ton of fun at our Throwback to the 90s, Outer Space, Book Fair, Slumber Party, and other themed markets, and we can't wait to bring the good vibes to Genesee Gateway Park. With space for up to 75 vendors, food trucks, live music, photo opps, interactive games & activities, AND a beautiful location right on the Genesee River, *you don’t want to miss it.*

YES, I am aware how unfortunate my name choice was. No one is more aware than I am. I chose it before any of that came to light, and I DID have a reason behind it, which I still believe in. You can make fun of me all you want, but be mindful of the 100+ artists, resellers, and small businesses who have found a home at these events. All I want to do is support them and create fair, affordable, welcoming, and genuinely enjoyable opportunities for as many people as possible. I’ve seen amazing vendors treated horribly, and I feel incredibly passionate about changing that. I hope you give us the chance to show you the community we’ve starting building, so we can give Freak Out a better connotation around here. It’s truly an incredible group of creators, innovators, and genuinely kind people who deserve more than being dismissed due to a really unfortunate similarity.

There’s a lot I wish I could change about this city, but I’m doing the best I can with limited resources and only my imagination as a guideline. And I’ve seen the difference it makes for a lot of people, from vendor friendships to new volunteers getting involved, from families who had a blast to attendees we introduced to their new favorite shop. I hope you take the time to stop in and check out. Stop by the info table and let me know what you think. You don’t have to like the name, but we’re building something awesome and I’d love for you to be part of it :)

  


***WAYS TO JOIN THE FAMILY:***

**Vend:** Do you have a business, make cool stuff, or love thrifting? Come set up a booth! It’s $45 to pre-register or you can show up that morning for $50. Applications and more details are on our linktree. No MLMs or direct sales!

**Volunteer:** Wanna make friends and help out? We could use some extra hands for taking pics and videos, handing out flyers, helping with parking, and manning the info table. Our volunteer team is great, it’s super lowkey, and you’ll have plenty of time to hang out and shop.

**Shop:** We’ve got a ton of amazing vendors already registered - artists, resellers, food & drink - and more are signing up every day. You might just find your new favorite thing.

**Just hang out:** Too broke to shop? That’s okay! There’s never a cover charge at Freak Out markets. Come for the vibes, the people watching, the community. These events are for everyone in Rochester, not just people with money to spend.

For the last couple of years, i have been really enjoying making iced tea with my soda stream.  I will carbonate water and then throw a tea bag in.  

In the beginning there were some specifically designed cold brew tea bags that were readily available and great because they would brew in about 10 min.  

Unfortunately those aren't readily available anymore, so i've been using loose leaf tea.  While this is great because i get access to all kinds of awesome tea flavors (mostly herbal and rooibos) it takes longer to brew.  I generally use a little above luke warm water throw a tea bag in, then leave it in the fridge for a couple of hours.

However this morning, i used the bottom of one of my bags, and all of the little bits, and it brewed up nice and strong, and quick.  

So this got me thinking, if i were to get a coffee grinder, and run my loose leaf teas through it (i can experiment with different grinds). Would that get me a iced tea that brews a little faster?
