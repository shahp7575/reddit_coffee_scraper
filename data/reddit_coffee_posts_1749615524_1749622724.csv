1l8lepd,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaSMarketing/comments/1l8lepd/long_documents_no_thanks_chat_with_them_like_a/,Long documents? No thanks. Chat with them like a friend — only on PlusDocSign. Free to use.,"Hi r/SaasMarketing

  
I’m Sania Naaz, and I’ve been working on a SaaS product called [PlusDocSign](https://plusdocsign.com) – an AI-powered digital signature platform designed to help businesses **sign smarter and faster**.

As new markets emerge and remote work becomes the norm, signing PDF documents instantly and securely has never been more important. That's where PlusDocSign comes in — combining digital signatures with **AI chat** to make agreement management simpler, faster, and more transparent.

# What is PlusDocSign?

It’s a digital signature platform with a twist — it includes an AI chat interface that lets users ask questions about a document before signing. No more confusion or delays in the process. It's like having a smart assistant built into your contracts.

# 🔑 Key Features:

1. AI-Based Document Chat: Ask questions, clarify terms, and review before signing — all through an AI chatbot.
2. User-Friendly Interface: No steep learning curve. Sign, send, and manage documents easily — even for non-tech users.
3. High Security & Compliance End-to-end encryption + full compliance with eIDAS, ESIGN, and other regulations.
4. It's cost-effective — less than the price of a coffee per user. Plans for freelancers, startups, and enterprises — without bloated features or hidden costs.

# Why I Built It:

I noticed that many digital signature tools are either too expensive, too complicated, or lacking support for users who have doubts about what they’re signing. I wanted to solve that with something smarter — and more human.

I am not promoting,  I’d love feedback from this community.  
Would you use a tool like this? Any thoughts on messaging, positioning, or growth?

🙏 Happy to answer any questions or suggestions!

English is also not my first language, so please keep that in mind.

On Friday morning me and my husband had an argument, where things got quite heated. Tbh, I wasn't in the best of moods to begin with - woke up irritated. I don't even remeber the exact beginning of the fight, but at some point the conversation went towards the matter of finances. This topic is a sensitive spot for him as he gets quite mad whenever I bring it up during our fights. And as excpected it happened again. We got both quite mad, so I said we have to stop talking. I was in the kitchen standing next to the window sill, he stepped out of the kitchen, then came back and wanted to continue fighting. I closed my ears and he moved towards where I was standing, then I proceeded to leave as I did not want to talk in that state. As I was leaving he kind of hugged/grabbed me and pushed me towards the window sill. The sill is on the inside of the appartment and is quite wide, so we put the microwave, coffee machine and a sound box on it to save space. When he pushed me I fell onto those things, as a result quite heavily scratching my arm. I also then noticed two bruises on my arm and one on my thigh (the bruises are painful and VERY visible right now). After he pushed me I ran to the bedroom, panicked and in shock. Was crying, not knowing what to do and felt like going back to the kitchen and getting my phone. My husband went to the living room after the incident, so he wasn't in the kitchen.

Once again, I didn't know what to do. But felt like it was necessary to document the bruising, so I took pictures with my phone when going back to the kitchen. At that point my husband came in the kitchen, started apologising and telling me to show him my arm. The bruises weren't very visible then, only the scratch - which I think looked quite minor to him. So I noticed how immediately relivied he became. Then we sat on the kitchen floor while he apologized a couple of times, but he quickly turned into blaming me for what happened (e.g. it wouldn't happen if I didn't refuse to continue the argument, he wanted to make me listen to him, it wasn't an intentional push, don't dramatize what happened...).

I got up and started sorting some stuff, which I think made him think like everything was normal. But in reality I was still in shock and thinking about what to do next. Texted my friend, she told me to gather some stuff and come to her, so I quickly left. He thought I went to a pilates class. I called my mom from my friend's house, then sent pics of bruises to his mom and sister. Then I went to my sister's apt and decided not to go back home. I wanted to make him realize this is not ok.

Long story short, he came in the evening of that day apologising, swore it won't ever happen again and asked to come back home. I got all soft and feelings got in the way, so I went back home. Didn't even stay 1 night not in our apartment.

Now I feel so low of myself for doing that, for looking like I forgave him so easily. I feel stupid, ashamed, also everyone around me was telling me to leave him, punish and scare him harder, etc. I also hate myself for having strong feelings for him which made me go back. I don't believe him yet tbh, because although he never did such a thing before, he did something kinda physical - like threw stuff at me (pillow and shorts), held my mouth to gather my attention. There were 3 instances of such aggression including the recent incident.

I want to underline that I am no saint myself. There were times where I have yelled and got mad at him during arguments, so it is safe to say we are not the perfect couple that never argues, always resolves everything quick and happily, etc. We both love each other, got married because we wanted to. But I don't know what to do now. Leaving and divorcing seems easy as a step, but I don't know if I can and want to do that right now. I fully realize how this is not an ok situation and I should stop everything right away, but the stupid feelings are stopping me.

FYI: We got married less than a year ago, have no kids yet, but want to in the future. We both work full time, I also am getting my masters degree, finances are 50/50 for now, but he promised to become the primary breadwinner of the family in the future (important for me, I am quite conservative in this matter and he knows).",1,1749621937.0,domesticviolence,0,1.0,False
1l8l7ak,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1l8l7ak/the_zillionaires_abandoned_wife_part_2_if_trixie/,"The Zillionaire's Abandoned Wife { Part 2 } :  If Trixie wanted him to leave immediately, he would arrange it immediately. But before she could finish what she was saying, she suddenly remembered what Sebastian had said before, when Trixie first joined the company. He said that everything related...","She's up to anything as long as she can have her Tres back. So her original goal was to become Sebastian's personal secretary. But Sebastian didn't agree. Even though old Valderama intervened, it still did nothing to make the man agree. In the end, Trixie had no choice but to accept her second option, staying in the secretarial position as one of Sebastian's many ordinary secretaries. At first, Calix thought that Trixie might just be disrupting the secretariat department. But he was wrong. Although Trixie uses her position to get close to Sebastian, she knows the right timing and doesn't overstep her bounds. In fact, perhaps to impress Sebastian, Trixie worked very hard at work. She was very good, and even when she was pregnant or had just given birth, she still followed the company's policies and never asked for special treatment. Over the years, he became the team leader of that department. Calix knows how much Trixie loves Sebastian. So he didn't expect such a sudden announcement. He didn't think the woman knew how to get tired. Trixie was going to resign. He also doesn't believe that she left voluntarily. The only reason he could think of was that something happened between Trixie and Sebastian that he didn't know about and Sebastian himself ordered Trixie to stay away from him. It's a shame because Trixie is still very good at her job. But since she officially said goodbye, Calix handled this situation in a professional manner. I'm accepting your resignation letter. Thank you for your hardwork all these years. I will be looking for a replacement for your position as soon as possible. ""Say. Trixie nodded and returned to her desk. After a few hours of being busy, Calix reported to Sebastian online. When their conversation was almost over, Calix suddenly remembered Trixie's resignation.  Ah, Mr. Valderama, about— Although he told Trixie that he would take care of her replacement, he still wanted to know Sebastian's opinion on when Trixie should leave. If Trixie wanted him to leave immediately, he would arrange it immediately. But before she could finish what she was saying, she suddenly remembered what Sebastian had said before, when Trixie first joined the company. He said that everything related to Trixie should be in line with company regulations and there was no need to report to him. He won't interfere with it anymore.And it's true. In all the years they had been together at the same company, Sebastian had never asked anything about Trixie. When he sees her at the office, she seems like just an ordinary employee, or worse, she just thinks of her as a stranger. In recent years, Trixie has performed very well at the company. Two years ago, before they planned to promote it, they consulted Sebastian first. If he doesn't want to, they won't continue with it. But when Sebastian heard this, he frowned and said the decision impatiently. Don't ask me about Trixie Salvador. I won't meddle with any of her affairs. Just stick to the rules of the company.""

From then on, they didn't ask him about Trixie anymore.

Sebastian noticed that Calix seemed to be about to say something but couldn't continue, so he frowned slightly.

""What is it?""

Calix came to his senses and quickly answered.

""Nothing.""

Because he knew Calix hadn't mentioned it to him, meaning that whatever he wanted to say earlier didn't matter.

Calix, on the other hand, simply did what was required of Trixie's resignation according to company regulations.

After that, Sebastian hung up the call.

""What are you thinking?""

It was noon when a colleague suddenly tapped Trixie on the shoulder.

Only then did he come back to his senses, smile at his officemate, and shake his head.

""Nothing.""

""Aren't you going to call your son now?""

""It's okay, no need.""

Usually, Trixie calls her daughter twice a day, once at eleven o'clock at night and again at noon.

All her colleagues in the office know this because this has been her consistent routine since Trixie's daughter came to the US.

But what they don't know is that the father of their child is none other than the big boss of their company.

After work that night, Trixie stopped by the market to buy some vegetables and some green plant pots before heading home.

After dinner, he opened his laptop and searched for news about an upcoming technology exhibition.

After reading, he immediately called a number.

""Kindly reserve one ticket for me for the upcoming tech exhibition.It's next month,right?""

The voice on the other line was cold when he answered.

""Are you sure? You've asked me several times to reserve you a ticket, but you never showed up. You're just wasting the ticket that many people dream of.""

That annual tech exhibition is a big event in the said industry. You can't just get a ticket for it.

Even their company only has limited spots, so many employees want to join but are not lucky enough.

For them, every spot in that rare event was very important.

Trixie smiled and said, ""If I don't show up now, I'll never talk to you again. Hold on to my words.""

The person on the other line didn't say anything, but ended the call.

Trixie knew she had accepted it.

He smiled.

What he didn't mention was that he wanted to return to the company where he had been a shareholder for a long time.

As one of the partners of the company, he chose to get married and have children when it was just starting out. Because of this, he gradually disappeared from the company and focused on his family, which is why the development of their business was delayed.

Many are angry with him.

For many years, he had almost no contact with friends.

And now, he doesn't even call his parents anymore.

And of course, it seems like they don't care about him because they don't contact him either.

He was no longer surprised.

Since half a year had passed, calling Xyza was his own decision.

They? They just answered it without caring.

Meanwhile, in America, Xyza has gotten used to calling Wendy every morning after waking up.

And as usual, he called her that day.

But they hadn't talked for long when she suddenly burst into tears.

Wendy brought bad news.

""My Aunt Mommy is leaving to return to the Philippines!""

Xyza felt this deeply.

After hanging up, he immediately called Sebastian.

""Daddy!Tita Mommy is coming back to the [Philippines.Do](http://Philippines.Do) you know about this?""

At the office, Sebastian is still busy reading documents even though he is distracted by his son's tantrums.

His voice was emotionless when he answered.

""Yes.""

Xyza's eyes widened.

""When did you know, Daddy?!""

""It's been a long time.""

He fainted upon hearing this.

""Daddy, you're so mean... Why didn't you tell me? I can't afford to lose my Aunt Mommy! I don't want to go to school without her. I want to go back to Manila! Waaah\~""

Sebastian maintained a calm tone.

""It's already been taken care of, my daughter. Stop crying, would you?"" He softened his voice to make it more effective.

Xyza swallowed.

""W-What do you mean po?""

Sebastian smiled slightly and said,

""We're going back to the Philippines next week.""

""Omg!Is that for real,Daddy?!""

Xyza jumped out of bed.

""Yup.""

""Why didn't Aunt Mommy even tell me about that earlier?""

""Because it was just finalized today. That's why I've been working my ass off these days so I don't have any work left at our branch here. And I still haven't told him, so be quiet, okay?""

Xyza became even more excited.

""Omg, Dad! Yes, we'll keep this a secret from Aunt Mommy. Hey! When we get home, let's surprise her! Can we?!""

""Say.""

""Yay! Dad, you're really great! I love you so much, my best Daddy. Wow!""

After the call ended, Xyza was still very happy. She sang and even danced on the bed.

After a while, he suddenly remembered Trixie.

In recent days, because his mother hadn't called him, he had felt very relieved.

In fact, just to avoid his mother's calls, he deliberately left early every morning. Sometimes, when he came home from school, he would put his cellphone away or turn it off so that it would be out of coverage.

But after two days, he was afraid that his mother might be completely angry, so he stopped avoiding her calls.

He was very surprised when he noticed that she didn't actually call him in the following days.

At first, he thought maybe his mother knew that he was deliberately avoiding her call, so that's why.

But when he thought about it, based on his past experience, if he did something wrong, his mother would definitely tell him.

It's not like he just won't notice her and won't call.

What is her Mom up to these days that she completely forgot to call her only daughter?

He knows that he is the most important person in his mom's heart, so sometimes he takes advantage of her.

He couldn't believe that she could actually not call him for so long!

Is her Mom completely ignoring her?!Is she fed up with her antics?This ain't right!

At that point, Xyza suddenly missed Trixie.

For many days, he only thought about it now.

He couldn't help himself and immediately called her.

But as the phone rang, he remembered that even though he was going home to the Philippines and would see his Aunt Mommy, his mother would definitely do everything to prevent him from seeing Wendy.

He can no longer just see Wendy whenever he wants, unlike here in the US.

Because of that thought, he suddenly felt heavy.

Trixie was sleeping soundly when she suddenly woke up because of Xyza's call.

Upon seeing her name on the screen, she was about to press to answer the call when Xyza suddenly hung up.

Even though he wrote in the divorce agreement that he had given up custody of Xyza to Sebastian, she was still his child.

And as a mother, she still has responsibility for this.

So when he saw her call but then suddenly hang up, he immediately became nervous.

Maybe something happened because it's not normal for him to call her first. It's always the other way around.

So she called back.

When Xyza saw her mother's call, she immediately turned her face away and let it go as a missed call.

Trixie on the other line became even more nervous.

Because of this, he called the mansion's landline in the US.

Nana Sela answered the phone.

Hearing Trixie's concern, she quickly replied, ""Oh, it seems like Xyza is fine. The young miss just stayed up late last night. She went to bed late so this morning, she was fast asleep and couldn't get up right away. I just went up to check on her but she was still sound asleep at that time. But okay, I'll go up again to check, then I'll call you back, hija.""

Trixie breathed a small sigh of relief.

""Okay. Thank you very much, Nana Sela.""

When Nana Sela went upstairs, she saw that Xyza was already awake and was currently washing her face in the bathroom.

When she asked him about the call, the child replied in a lazy tone. ""I just accidentally pressed it, Nana.""

Nana Sela didn't suspect him. She saw that he was busy brushing his teeth so she went downstairs to inform Trixie of the situation.

After Nana Sela left, Xyza smiled secretly.

He took a deep breath, and somehow, he felt better.

Meanwhile, even though Trixie was reassured by Nana Sela's words, she couldn't sleep well.

The next day, he woke up groggy and not in the mood to go to work.

On the other hand, the envelope containing the divorce agreement that Trixie gave to Sebastian has not been opened again since he received Wendy's call.

Until the day of their return to Manila arrived.

After putting the last document in his briefcase, Sebastian made sure he didn't forget anything.

When everything was okay, he turned around and went down the stairs.

""Okay, let's leave.""

The long Lincoln limousine immediately left the mansion, heading straight for the airport.

Trixie had no idea that Sebastian and her son had returned to Manila.

No one even bothered to tell her.

More than half a month has passed since he left his and his wife's mansion.

During that time, he gradually got used to it, and unexpectedly even liked the quiet and peaceful life of being alone.

Today is Saturday. He woke up at noon.

After washing and grooming herself, she opened the curtain and caught a glimpse of the sun shining outside the window. She stretched, watered her plants, and prepared a simple breakfast for one person.

But before he could begin, the doorbell suddenly rang.

When he opened the door, Mrs. Peña, his neighbor across the street, greeted him.

""Trixie, mom, am I bothering you?""

Trixie smiled.

""No, I just woke up and I'm eating in the kitchen right now.""

""That's good!"" Mrs. Peña replied happily.

""By the way, this is the spaghetti and puto we cooked earlier. I brought it for you to taste.""

Trixie was surprised.

""Thank you. But this seems like too much...I'm here alone.""

""No, mom, that's really for you.""

""Wow. You took the trouble. Thank you for this.""

""Oh my, that's nothing! If you hadn't saved my grandson Tantan the other day, I don't know what would have happened to him because of that stray dog! I really wanted to thank you before, but my husband and I are always busy with work. We only had time today. We're so embarrassed!""

""That's nothing, Mrs. Peña. It's just a small thing.""

They continued their brief conversation before Mrs. Peña finally said goodbye.

Back inside, Trixie ate while looking at the algorithm of an AI she had recently been studying.

When the afternoon arrived, a news item about the centennial anniversary of the university, which is known in the world of technology, appeared on his cellphone.

Trixie stopped.

He looked at the date and remembered that today was Mapua University's birthday.

On social media, there are many trending topics about #MapuaUniversity100Years.

People are very interested in this celebration, not only because Mapua University is one of the leading universities in the Philippines, but also because this is its first centennial anniversary.

Many prominent alumni were invited back to participate in the celebration. Experts and successful professionals in various industries.

As he looked at the pictures, he saw some familiar faces.

When he saw some old acquaintances on the screen, his hand on the keyboard suddenly trembled.

Memories of when he was still in college came back to him.

Suddenly his mind was confused.

If he hadn't gotten married right after college, he would probably also be one of the honorary alumni invited today.

He closed the laptop, hesitated for a moment, but in the end, he decided to go to Mapua University.

When he arrived there, it was afternoon.

Most of the guests had already left, but there were still many people inside the campus.

He walked around without any specific direction.

Many memories came to his mind as he walked through the campus.

There is joy, there is sadness, and most of all, there are memories of him and Tres from before.

He immediately shook his head because he couldn't go to that memory.

Her moments with Tres before were like a cherished memory that she didn't have a choice but to bury into her heart.

Their love already fell apart,there's no point now reminiscing about it.

He walked again, and when he reached the old laboratory building, a familiar voice called out to him.

""Alyssa?""

Twenty minutes later, two women can be seen sitting in a milk tea house near Mapua University.

The woman sips her Okinawa flavored milk tea.

""How have you been these past few days?""

Trixie held the cup, bowed slightly, and smiled sparingly.

""That's fine...but, I'm planning to divorce him.""

Charina was surprised but also remained silent for a moment before saying, ""Oh, about time! But, I'm sorry to hear that girl.""

""It's okay.""

""What are your plans after that? Are you going back to our company?""

Trixie thought. ""I was planning to go back, but...""

Charina didn't know what came over her, but she spoke seriously.

""Trixie Alyssa Salvador. The company needs you. You are one of its founders, you have a big contribution to our company! I hope you come back and lead the company again. We're all rooting for you, bitch.""

Trixie looked at Charina.

He found it difficult to answer.

It's not that he doesn't want to go back.

The truth is, the AI ​​industry is developing rapidly today.

He has been absent from this field for six years.

Even if he returns, he is afraid he won't be able to keep up.

And most importantly, how can he regain his former ability to lead the company in the face of rapidly changing technology?

And one more thing,can she stand up against her half sister?Kaya ba niya?

Well, no one will ever know if they don't try.

Trixie needs to be strong,even if it means going against her father's own company.

In recent years, Charina Villalobos and Trixie have rarely seen each other.

But after meeting each other a few times, Charina noticed that Trixie was far from the cheerful and energetic woman she had known during their college days.

Back then, he never thought that there would be a day when Trixie would feel low about herself.

Even though he wasn't completely familiar with Trixie and Sebastian's married life, he had some idea about it.

He had a suspicion, but he didn't mention it. So he just advised him.

""It doesn't matter if there are times when you fall behind. Your intelligence and talent are unmatched by the average genius out there. Girl, Trixie, as long as you still want to walk this path, it's not too late to start again. You are excellent in this field even back in our college years! What more now, right?""

""Don't forget, you are my favorite friendship in our circle.""

Trixie smiled. ""If our other friends heard this, they'd probably laugh at you and say you were forced into it and that you're just gaslighting. Such a betrayer.""

""Oh, don't whine. Even our terror professor was the favorite!""

He remembered their terror teacher from before, elegant but sharp-tongued. His smile widened slightly.

""I saw on the news that the teacher also attended the celebration. How is she?""

""It's good, but sometimes he gets irritated with us. Especially when our circle gets close to him, we always fight.""

Trixie laughed. She remembered the times when she was forced to write research papers almost every day under the guidance of her teacher.

""Come back, Alyssa!""

""Stop. No one calls me that anymore.""

""No, girl. What does your first name mean? It doesn't suit your angelic features!""

Trixie tightened her grip on her cup of milktea. She took a deep breath and nodded.

""Alright.""

Since childhood, he has been passionate about artificial intelligence.

He truly loves this field.

But she put her dream aside for six or seven years because of her love for Sebastian.

Now, he has been absent from the industry for a long time. His return will not be easy.

But he believes that if he works hard, he can still catch up.

""When will you be back?"" Charina asked.

""I still have to take care of my work now. I need to train my replacement, so it might take a while.""

""It's okay, we're not in a hurry. For sure, the girls would scream because of this news.""

Since he would come back anyway, it didn't matter if they waited a little longer.

They continued talking. After a while, Charina looked at her watch.

""People at the company introduced me to someone, an expert in algorithms. He just got back from Amsterdam a few days ago. We were talking about meeting today. Since we met, would you like to come along?""

Trixie shook her head. ""I don't know the people at the company. Next time.""

""Say.""

After Charina left, Trixie noticed a familiar figure approaching her, Ate Sabrina, Sebastian's older sister.

He also saw it on the news earlier.

He didn't expect to meet her here.

He smiled and greeted her, ""Ate Sabby.""

But Sabrina ignored him. Instead, she examined him with a frowning expression.

""What are you doing here?""

""Today is the centennial anniversary of Mapua, I just came back to check.""

If Trixie hadn't mentioned it, Sabrina would have probably forgotten that she also graduated from Mapua University.

But with so many returning to school today, most of them are honorary alumni invited by the university.

So why is Trixie still here?

But he decided to ignore it, as long as he didn't say anything that would embarrass the Valderama family.

While thinking about this, Sabrina directly said what was on her mind.

""Alexi likes your cooking. I'll send him to you and Seb later.""

Alexianna is Sabrina's daughter. She is one or two years older than Xyza.

Sabrina and her husband's relationship was not good. For several years, she was so busy with work that she rarely had time to take care of her son. Because of this, he grew up stubborn and difficult to discipline.

He knows that Alexi likes Trixie's cooking, so whenever he has the chance, he sends her and Sebastian to visit.

In the Valderama family, only the old lady values ​​Trixie.

There is nothing else.

And at Alexianna's age, it's easy for her to imitate other people.

Even though Alexianna loved Trixie's cooking, she never considered her a real aunt. Instead, she considered her a nanny who could be ordered around whenever she wanted.

Before, because of Sebastian, Trixie was patient. She didn't understand Alexi's disrespect and continued to take good care of him.

But now that she's preparing to break up with Sebastian, she has no intention of making any more sacrifices for it.

So Trixie flatly refused. ""I'm sorry, Sister Sabby, but I'm not free tomorrow.""

Now that he's back in his field, he'll spend his time on important things.

And once their divorce is processed, she will no longer have anything to do with Sebastian, Sabrina, or any Valderama.

He won't waste his time on them anymore.

Sabrina didn't think Trixie would reject her.

Back then, for Sebastian, he was willing to endure everything and do everything for the Valderama family.

But he didn't think about it any further.

Trixie had never rejected him before, so he thought maybe she really had something important to do. Otherwise, why would she waste the opportunity to be with him?

However, he couldn't help but feel irritated.

""Sebastian and Xyza aren't by your side right now. What else are you busy with?""

Trixie smiled, but deep down, she wanted to be angry with the woman.

For so many years, she threw away her own dreams and made Sebastian and their daughter Xyza the center of her world.

It's no wonder Sabrina looks at him this way now.

But everything will change from now on.

He is about to open a new chapter in his life.

Before he could speak, several people were approaching them.

""Miss Valderrama!""

It seems they are looking for Sabrina.

One of them looked at Trixie and asked, ""Miss Valderama, who is she?""

In a cold voice, Feng Tinglin replied without hesitation, ""Old friend.""

""Oh, it's a friend...""

These people hold high positions and also attended the anniversary of Mapua University.

At first, they thought the person Sabrina Valderama was talking to was special, so they approached her.

But when they heard his answer, they immediately realized that this was not a person of position or influence.

Some of them briefly glanced at Trixie, especially at her long, white legs. But after that, no one paid any attention to her.

They continued talking to Sabrina and immediately left.

If this had happened before, Trixie might have been hurt by Sabrina not recognizing her as her sister-in-law.

But now, he doesn't care anymore.

When Sabrina left, Trixie picked up her bag and left as well.

At twelve o'clock at night, the plane that Sebastian and Xyza were on arrived at the airport.

When they got home, it was almost morning.

Xyza was already sleeping soundly before they even got home.

Sebastian carried her upstairs to his room. As he passed the master bedroom, he noticed that the door was open, but it was dark inside.

After he took Xyza to her room, he returned to the master bedroom and turned on the dim light in the room. When he looked at the bed, it was empty.

Trixie wasn't there.

The butler was just about to go upstairs, carrying their suitcases.

While loosening the necktie he was wearing, Sebastian asked, ""Where is he?""

The butler at the mansion here in Manila immediately replied, ""Ma'am Trixie is on a business trip.""

It's been half a month since Trixie left.

Sebastian wasn't there at the time, so he didn't know the full details.

But he heard from another housekeeper that Trixie was carrying a suitcase when she left.

That means it's been gone for a long time.

It was surprising because Trixie rarely went on business trips before. And if she did go, it would usually only last two or three days.

But now, he hasn't returned for over half a month.

""Hmm,"" was Sebastian's only answer, and he didn't ask any more questions.

He no longer cares about what Trixie does with her life.

The next day, when Sebastian arrived at the company, he suddenly met Trixie.

Trixie didn't know that Sebastian and Xyza had already returned to Manila, which is why she was momentarily stunned when she saw them in that company hallway.

Sebastian was also surprised to see her, but he just thought that Trixie had just returned from a business trip and didn't pay much attention to her disappearance.

His face was expressionless as if he didn't know Trixie. He just passed her by coldly and went straight inside the presidential office.

If this had happened back then, Trixie would definitely have been happy to see Seb return unexpectedly.

Even if he didn't even give her a hug after they hadn't seen each other for so long, her eyes would still shine and her heart would be filled with happiness.

Surely, no matter how coldly he treated her, she would still smile at him and greet him with ""Good morning.""

But now, Trixie just looked at the man's receding bulk, then lowered her gaze.

Any trace of excitement or joy on his face had completely disappeared.

On the other hand, Sebastian didn't notice that small change and just continued walking.

As Trixie watched the man's elegant back, she found herself wondering when they had arrived.

But if Sebastian is back, they'll definitely be discussing their divorce agreement soon, right?

Since he was determined to be free, he didn't think about it anymore. He immediately returned to his desk and continued the work he had left off.

Half an hour later, Calix called him.

""Make two cups of coffee and take it to Mr. Valderama's office. Make it fast.""

He just laughed sarcastically at a memory that came back to him.

Back then, in order to get closer to Sebastian, Trixie even studied coffee making when she discovered that her husband loved it. She spent a lot of time in coffee making workshops and really worked hard just to enhance that skill.

And his efforts paid off.

After Sebastian tasted her coffee, he made what she had always been looking for. Whether at home or at the office, he was the only one who wanted to make her coffee.

When he first heard her compliment, he couldn't believe it. He thought that was the first step towards them getting closer...

But she didn't realize how much Sebastian was avoiding and being cold towards her.

Yes, he likes the coffee he brewed, but he who makes it, never does.

So whenever Sebastian wants coffee, he orders Calix to call him. And when he's finished brewing, someone else picks up the coffee to bring to Sebastian.

He really doesn't give her any chance to get close to him.

But there are also times when Calix and the other staff are very busy, only then does he have the chance to personally bring coffee to Sebastian's office.

And now, from the tone of Calix's words earlier, it seemed like he had to deliver the coffee to Sebastian himself.

So after making the coffee, Trixie put it on the tray and went to Sebastian's office.

When he arrived in front of his office door, his forehead creased slightly because the door wasn't closed properly. It was slightly ajar.

He bent down, intending to knock, but from the crack of the open door, he saw an unpleasant scene.

He saw Sebastian and Wendy.

Wendy just sat on his lap, hugging and kissing tightly.

Trixie stopped what she was doing, and her face suddenly went cold.

It seemed like they noticed someone else because Wendy turned her head in his direction. When she saw him, Wendy immediately got off Sebastian's lap.

Sebastian looked at him with great annoyance.

""Who told you that you have the permission to be here?!""

Trixie grabbed the tray tightly because of his sudden scream.

""I just brought you coffee—""

""Sige na,Secretary Salvador,I'll take this from [here.You](http://here.You) can go.""

Suddenly, another of Sebastian's personal secretary, Yuan Cruz, appeared.

She is also one of the few who knows the true relationship between Trixie and Sebastian.

""You know, I'm the one who's getting tired of what you're doing,"" he said with a slight sarcasm in his tone.

He didn't need to explain. Trixie immediately understood what Yuan wanted to convey.

He thinks he went there on purpose because he knows Wendy is at the company. And he tries to ruin the relationship between the two by pretending to just bring coffee.

From Sebastian's expression and anger, it's not far from the fact that he's thinking the same thing.

If this had happened before, he might have done it out of desperation. But now, since they were about to get divorced, how could he do such a thing?

The she cares.

But he was not given a chance to explain to any of the people in that office.

Yuan ordered him coldly, ""Leave immediately.""

For all the awful treatment, Trixie's eyes turned red, and her hand that had been holding the tray trembled slightly. Coffee spilled from the cup and burned her fingers.

It hurt, but he didn't complain and endured what happened. He didn't have the power to disobey their orders, so he quietly turned around and left.

But before he could walk away completely, he heard Sebastian's cold voice again from where he was sitting.

I just had the weirdest dream ever, and I cant say I've ever experienced anything like it before. It truly felt like the man in my dream was out of place and did not belong.. Was this person a true intruder, or someone I made up in my head? Can anyone help me interpret this? Here's what happened:

I dreamt that it was daytime. I was in a living room that isn't my own (irl I don't recognize it, but in my dream I was comfortable there like it was home). There was a standard living room layout, 2 couches, coffee table, rug. Just out of sight was the dining room, and directly in front of the couches was a sliding glass door with the blinds blocking my view of the outside. At the time, I was teaching some kid how to properly do squats. I was demonstrating the technique to him as we both stood in the living room. Suddenly, out of nowhere, the glass door slid open. I couldn't see anything because the blinds were closed, but immediately my body went on high alert. I reached to grab the sliding glass door and touched a HAND. And when I opened the door the rest of the way I saw a man. He looked like he had made a mistake. He looked like he didnt think I would be there. He was around 5'9"" wearing a basic t shirt and jeans, and he had brown hair. All i could think was to ask him ""who are you?"" and ""how did you get here?"" to which he was sort of evasive but mostly nervous and trying to retreat to the gate entrance to the backyard. My husband (in the dream) said something to the effect of ""I've seen this man before, he's been out there before"" as I followed him toward the gate. I stopped following him when I saw through the open gate another man, this one with sunglasses, receiving his friend so they could go retreat somewhere else. After this I tried to keep dreaming, to keep sleeping, but I simply couldn't. 

My dream was so peaceful before the door opened.. it just felt so odd and jarring and out kf place for thay to happen. And as I questioned this man it really felt like he didnt mean harm and it was an accident that he was inspecting the house while I was there. From a dream interpretation, what could this possibly mean? And a separate (maybe silly) question, is it possible for other people to hop into my dream? ",1,1749621705.0,Dreams,1,1.0,False

Now I don't know what to do.,"I've worked with my coworker for about 2 or 3 years now. She's a lovely girl. She's always been friendly, warm, buggy and outgoing. We've flirted lightly whole we worked together, but I had always been respectful cause she had a long term partner. But we work in a restaurant so people are flirty.

A few months ago she has a nasty breakup with her ex partner and she's been dealing with that. I've had feelings for awhile for her but didn't want to bring them up right away cause I know she's dealing with a lot. But I also wanted to make how I feel known. I always has a bit of a feeling she liked me too, she'd say things like ""I had a dream I brought you to meet my family"" and we'd always have very warm hugs and just the general vibe you get when someone likes you.

We had gone for coffee a couple times and recently had a little outting with a coworker and her bf. Had some ice cream and chatted. And when they left I walked her back to her car. I decided to just tell her that I had feelings for her. That I think she's beautiful, sweet and wonderful. I also said I know she doesn't want anything right now. But that I wanted her to know how I felt.

She responded well, she was surprised, smiled a lot. Told me that it was brave and that she kind of likes me too. But was not ready for anything and didn't want to lead me on. She mentioned even saying ""we would be so good together"" ""I even tell my mom about you(there's this great handsome guy at work). But again we hugged a lot, but I got the body language that she was turning away from a potential kiss. Despite her constantly holding me and hugging me.

We had a nice chat, wanted to get together again as friends for now and it seemed nice.

Part that has me confused is that she is super cold to me at work now. Won't stop and talk to me, doesn't seem to want to hug me and just kind of avoids me in conversation now. I don't know if I should ask her if we're cool or not or just let her be. I understand that this opened up a can of worms I suppose. But the energy shift from when I told her till now is totally different. Do I just let it be?

Tl;Dr told my coworker I liked her. She initially seemed super happy but not ready to move on from her last relationship yet. But now she's totally cold to me at work. ",2,1749621440.0,relationships,2,1.0,False

1l8l2s3,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1l8l2s3/my_whole_family_hates_me_because_grandpa_left_me/,My Whole Family Hates Me Because Grandpa Left Me Everything In His Will,"So I (28M) have always been the ""black sheep"" of the family. I'm not even sure why, to be honest. Maybe it's because I didn't follow the family blueprint of going into law or medicine. Maybe it’s because I actually got along with Grandpa, who they all low-key treated like a burden after Grandma passed.

Anyway, fast forward to last month—Grandpa passed. It was expected, but still hit me hard. I was the only one who visited him regularly at the nursing home, brought him his favorite snacks, listened to his endless stories about the “good old days,” and didn’t treat him like a walking corpse.

The family treated the funeral like an annoying chore. My uncle literally left early to catch a golf game. My mom complained the entire time about how “uncomfortable the seating” was. I gave the eulogy. Not a dry eye… except from my family, who were scrolling on their phones.

Then came the reading of the will.

And BOY.

Turns out, Grandpa left *everything* to me. His house (paid off), his retirement savings, even some old stocks that are apparently worth quite a bit now. Like, life-changing money.

The lawyer said Grandpa rewrote the will two years ago and legally notified everyone at the time, but I guess no one paid attention. Or they assumed he was bluffing. Now they’re furious. Like, SCORCHED EARTH furious.

My mom screamed at me that I “manipulated an old man.” My cousins are blowing up my phone demanding their “share.” My aunt threatened to sue (for what, I’m not sure—being his favorite?). I even got uninvited from a family wedding.

Here’s the thing: I didn’t ask for any of this. I was just there for him when no one else was. But now that it’s real, they can’t stand that the “disappointment” ended up with everything.

Part of me feels guilty. Part of me feels vindicated.

Either way, I’m going no-contact for a while. Gonna renovate Grandpa’s old house and live in it. Maybe finally adopt the dog he always said I should get.

And if you’re reading this, Grandpa… I hope you’re enjoying the peace and quiet. Thanks for always seeing me.

**UPDATE**

Hey Reddit — I didn’t expect my first post to blow up like it did, but thank you. Seriously. Reading through your responses, one comment hit me like a freight train:

>

That. That right there broke something open in me. I’d been carrying so much guilt — like I *stole* something — when all I did was care about someone who loved me when no one else in our family really bothered to.

So, here’s what’s happened since:

The fallout continued. My mom tried to stage what she called an “intervention,” which basically involved her, my aunt, and a cousin ambushing me on my front porch with coffee and condescension. They said things like “you’re isolating yourself” and “this isn’t what Grandpa *really* wanted,” and my favorite: “be reasonable — family is family.”

I reminded them that for the last decade, “family” meant birthday cards with no calls, holidays with empty chairs, and watching Grandpa slowly fade while they argued over whose turn it was to visit.

Then I told them to leave. Firmly. Calmly. And when my cousin muttered something about how I’d “regret this,” I just nodded and said, *“I don’t think Grandpa would want me to regret honoring his choice.”*

No lawsuit ever materialized — just a lot of vague Facebook shade and a few cryptic text messages. Honestly? Let them be mad.

As for the good stuff: I moved into Grandpa’s house. I’m renovating it room by room. I took down the plastic furniture covers, polished the old record player, and every night I spin one of his jazz albums while Rusty — my newly adopted golden mutt — snores on the rug. Grandpa always said I needed a dog. I finally listened.

I found a safe in the attic — inside were some baseball cards worth real money, some old Polaroids of him and Grandma, and one single handwritten note:

>

That’s the part that gets me. Grandpa *knew*. He knew what this would do. And he trusted me not to crumble under their noise. I don’t think he left me everything because I was his “favorite.” I think he left it to the person who *showed up when it mattered* — who *saw* him.

So yeah. I'm still grieving. Still healing. Still figuring it all out. But for the first time in a long time, I feel… grounded.

If you’re reading this, Grandpa — I kept my promise. The house is full of music again. And love. And a very hairy, very spoiled dog.

1l8l01a,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1l8l01a/help_is_this_fate_f25_f25/,HELP! is this fate? F25 F25,"In February of 2020 I met this girl I (25)f was 20 and she (25)f was 19. We fell in love. A week after we made it official Covid hit. She was an international student and had to go back home to be with her family during that time. I was really apprehensive to do long distance as I had horrible experiences with it before. This relationship was so safe. It challenged everything I thought I knew about people and healthy love. We struggled, a week or two turned into months. It was so hard to navigate the uncertainty and we were both really depressed. I self sabotaged and she ended things after 6 months.

I was destroyed. I went off the deep end and within a month ghosted her started dating and moved in with some else. (Big mistake, I regret it and hurting that person so much). I was so hurt I had to force myself to hate her.  I couldn’t find a single reason to be upset and that made it all the more impossible to cope with the breakup especially in isolation. Though Ive never to this day spoken bad word about her. 

The entirety of that relationship I thought about her. I cried, mourned and missed her like crazy. I tried to push it away. Because I was with someone who loved me. Eventually after a year I messaged her in November asking if we would maybe finally talk about what happened.

We chatted but she ghosted. (I now know her grandfather died and things got crazy) I couldn’t move on, knowing she was now back in my country tore me apart more. Months passed and it got worse. It got to the point where I was crying over her every day 

In July  I finally broke down and told my ex I couldn’t get over it. She gave me permission so within the hour I was face to face with the person I’d been yearning for then two and a half years.

We talked about everything, both took responsibility even though I thought she did nothing wrong. I learned that she was living here alone permanently and going for her PHD. The feelings were all still there. I was honest and said I was with someone and she told me to take all the time I needed to figure it out. She doesn’t wanna impose. She’s just here.

So I told my ex and we ended things and I tried to build a platonic relationship with this girl and see where it went. She was inconsistent with answers and understandably guarded. She would take weeks to respond with maybe even one message? I understood it was weird me just showing up and saying I still feel the same. So I gave her time. We were supposed to meet up again in a couple months after her research trip and travel in October. She communicated, sent pictures of her trip and said we were still on for around the 9th. When October came around no answer. She ghosted me.

January she reached out apologizing for ghosting. We ended up going to coffee. She explained that she was deeply hurt as to how I acted when we broke up that I seemed to hate her not even that I moved on but that I hated her so much and she was really scared to get hurt again. That by admitting she was ever hurt that she would then open herself up to that again. She said she proceeds with caution with me as I evoke really strong feelings in her. We planned to get drinks when I got back from traveling for a month for work.

I reached out a couple times but again dry. Different energy. I still tried. When I got back she didn’t have the time to hang out and soon left again for a research trip for three more months.

During that time I ended up meeting someone. She didn’t seem consistent and interested and at the time I really wanted to pursue this relationship so  I sent her a message after some small chit chat here and there that I met someone and I wish her the best and I hope to be friends. Not thinking she would take me up on it as she’s never showed interest. She replied  “okay cool no worries I just got back to the city today” TODAY?

After 8 months she starts messaging me weekly out of no where. We talked about everything she told me everything going on at the time she was dry and apologized for not explaining what was going on. I was finally getting that familiar energy I always remembered her for.

She told me she “was fully thinking we were gonna try to start again but when she got back I was in a relationship” and “she’s happy for me and maybe we could just be okay with things looking different.” That she “believed at times in a future where we ended up  together at different points”. And she had very valid reasons as to why she shut down and wasn’t answering as much but still should have told me cause how would I know and not think it was about me.

I enjoyed talking to her a lot. I started to pull back to respect my partner. My relationship wasn’t going well and it was nice to be talked to kindly by someone who always respected me. My partner at the time didn’t. I was in something so toxic. Eventually my partner got uncomfortable and I had to tell her that we couldn’t talk anymore out of respect for my relationship. Which she respected. But unfollowed me.

8 months passed and my relationship got worse. I admit in a weak moment I called her after one of the many times my ex left me. She picked up and told me she was just getting on a plane back to my city and had to go in a couple mins. The timing was crazy. I didn’t follow through with hanging out as I was grieving. I apologized and told her I wouldn’t bother her again and that I wasn’t okay and it was inappropriate  to call her. She left for Scotland for four months and never replied.

Currently, now 6 months later I am fully broken up with that girl. She broke things off a month ago. I’m devastated and healing from the trauma of that relationship. I have a lot of healing to do. Well, a week and a half into my breakup my phone rings out of no where. And it was her. I froze. I called her back instantly and she didn’t answer. I asked if it was a mistake and she said no. She doesn’t know why she called. We chatted a couple time since then. But what are the odds? I feel like this is a sign or something or maybe I’m crazy. I know I can’t even begin to worry about a relationship for a long time.

I’m grieving deeply and unfortunately overshared and kinda through her off. I hope I didn’t scare her off but she hasn’t answered in a couple days. This is five years of this now… Anywho… what does everyone else think? Help.",1,1749621030.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False
1l8kznn,https://www.reddit.com/r/askbuildersph/comments/1l8kznn/choosing_the_perfect_season_to_build/,Choosing the Perfect Season to Build,"Navigating Construction Risks in Rainy Seasons is very challenging. Construction timelines often face weather-related challenges, especially during the rainy season, where material erosion, worker safety concerns, and project delays become significant factors. In the Philippines, construction activity declines during monsoon months, impacting employment and project feasibility. This leads to a critical question during consultations: Which season is best for construction?

Key Questions Experts Ask Before Building in the Rainy Season

1. What Type of Project Are You Planning? Ground-up projects like residential houses, restaurants, and coffee shops face greater risks during monsoon months, as continuous rainfall can erode soil, damage materials, and increase worker hazards. However, interior fit-outs and renovations such as office spaces and condominium updates are less affected, making them better suited for the rainy season.

2. What Design Considerations and Supply Chain Challenges Exist? Clients often customize spaces with imported materials and furniture, making timing crucial. Weather-related delays in logistics caused by typhoons, road closures, and flooding can stall projects, making contingency planning necessary for material deliveries and procurement strategies.

3. Are Your Permits and Documents Ready? Construction projects require permits and zoning clearances at every stage, but administrative processes slow down during bad weather. Delays in paperwork processing can push timelines further, increasing risks like cost overruns and material degradation.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Strategic planning is key to avoiding delays during rainy seasons.

I've been a regular at my local location for 2 years, going 3 days per week (the days I had work; I really needed coffee for my shifts and was making enough to afford my drinks since I'm 18, live at home, barely spend money, and have no bills). I quit my job of 3 years a few months back because I wanted to pursue a job as a barista. The people at my location know me and my drink order, they're incredibly sweet and I would LOVE to work with them. I've applied a BUNCH of times, not just at the location I want to get into, but all the ones within driving distance. No one will hire me. I was one of the best workers at my last job (said by my boss, not self-proclaimed lol), graduated as an honors student with a math scholar award, I'm on time to shifts, a quick learner, responsible and respectful to clients. I don't understand?

The locations I've applied to are ALL hiring. They are actively looking both on the Starbucks Careers site and looking in real life for new employees. I have each individual location's hiring managers work emails/work numbers and every one says they're not hiring, overstaffed, or too busy to consider applicants. I tried asking about getting hired back when I first quit my job, and they said ""come back in the summer"". I came back in the summer, and STILL they say ""nope, come back later"". I emailed the manager of my closest location all my high points, my traits that would be useful as an employee, my resume, my past boss' info, and she still said ""try another location"". I literally don't understand what I should be doing differently.

**Please, if anyone could give advice, that would be great. Before anyone asks, yes, I have applied to local/small business coffee shops and cafes. I do know of all of the new rules SB has and I'm still interested in working there.** ",0,1749620949.0,starbucks,3,0.5,False

We were at our worst with each other instead of talking and resolving things. We couldn't find our way back to each other so we started hurting each other through words. He was trying to be hurtful. All the things he said about me were not true. He also pulled things from my past that I told him about and twisted them against me. I told him how I felt about things he said before we broke up and my feelings and thoughts he took as attacks and started saying things that weren't true. Tried to keep explaining that I wasn't trying to attack him but he wouldn't listen and kept pushing and at some point I got frustrated because he wasn't getting it and I started treating him the same. Saying hateful things. 


Couple weeks and it was still just a hard only he blocked me on everything. I wanted to fix it and just fall with the decision he made in our relationship without me. But he didn't want to.  He'd already gotten into another relationship. First month was hard. Second was harder because I felt myself letting go. Third month I was able to be around people. Fourth month the roughness under my eyes from crying finally was gone. I was letting go. Forget him. His face. His voice. The sound of his heart. I was smiling and laughing. I was going outside riding a bike. Playing sports. Going for walks and runs. Going to the park and doing pull ups while my kids play on the sliding swing thing. I wasn't obsessing over what he's doing or who he's with or maybe reach out to him. I forgave him. I forgave myself. I thought I let go. 


But then everything EVERYTHING every look, every conversation, every shower together, every movie night, ever coffee date, every time we cooked together, sat at the table and ate together, every time we went to the store or for a drive together, every time we texted when the other was at work, every night away from each other, every picture, every thought, every touch, every kiss, every long hug, every fight, every time we shut each other out, every laugh, everything started flooding in like it's telling me not to move on. Not to let go. I have been having very vivid dreams of him telling me he's forgiven me too and he wants to fix this and start over. I wake up and there is this warmth like it was real but it's not. 


Vivid vivid dreams like he's really here. And that conversation is actually happening. It feels like I'm in really good romantic where they fall apart but come back together. Like The Notebook or some other cheesy romantic. 


Why? I thought I was getting over him. I thought I was letting go. It flooded so suddenly. ",1,1749620754.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

From the get-go, we were super close—people thought we were old friends or had worked together before, but truth is, we had just met.

At first, it was great. We worked really well together, had similar humor, and just naturally got along. But as weeks went by, the dynamic started shifting. He began demanding more from me—longer hours, going the extra mile, things like that. At the same time, he’d buy me coffee before work, give me little gifts, or randomly treat me. It wasn’t anything huge, but it was frequent enough that people noticed.

There was this running joke in the team that I was his “favorite.” And yeah, sometimes it felt like it. I got what I needed quickly, but in return, the pressure was always on me. He expected a lot—like way more than he expected from anyone else. It wasn’t just professional, either. He started expecting me to be emotionally available for him too. Like, I had to listen when he vented, support him when he was stressed, and be “there” for him in a way that didn’t feel like part of my job.

Then things got weirder. A few months in, our relationship turned kind of toxic. We’d have screaming matches during one-on-ones, shut each other out for weeks, and then suddenly be back on friendly terms like nothing happened. It was like an emotional rollercoaster—up and down constantly.

Eventually, he moved to another team and got close with some other coworkers. I heard they were kind of insecure around me because he acted totally different with me—spending money, driving me places, checking in with me constantly. He was usually super frugal, but with me, it was the opposite, and that didn’t sit well with them.

Then one day, he just… left. No goodbye, no heads-up. We were on bad terms again at that point, so I guess I shouldn’t be surprised, but it still hurt. I stayed at the company, and we hadn’t talked for months.

But then—out of nowhere—on my birthday, he messaged me. Just a simple “Happy Birthday.” Nothing else. Like nothing happened. Like we hadn’t gone months without talking. Like he hadn’t just disappeared.

I don’t know how to feel about it. It pulled me right back into that confusing headspace. Part of me misses the friendship we had, but another part of me remembers how stressful and weird it got. It’s just this grey area that I can’t seem to get out of.

I guess I’m just venting. Or maybe hoping someone else can relate. I don’t know.",1,1749620581.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1l8kv2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1l8kv2c/i_wanted_to_believe_that_people_outgrow_this_kind/,I wanted to believe that people outgrow this kind of thing.,"Here is a story of social anxiety in the workplace. For context, I am an average-looking, middle-aged white female. I am married with two kids. I do not take medication for anxiety, although I sometimes manage it with CBD. 

I recently came home from a ten-day on-site work project that takes place in a convention center in a midsized American city. Thousands of people participate in this work event every year; they come from many walks of life, different ages, ethnicities, regions, etc. A day in this temporary workspace is highly structured. From eight to five, thousands of people are working at their computers, which are arranged in tables of six to twelve, and those tables are grouped in task-oriented divisions of dozens to hundreds, with multiple task groups in one of several cavernous quasi-industrial spaces lit by stadium-powered LED lamps. All day long, each person works at their given task, side by side with some people, within sightline of others, earshot of more. At ten AM, everyone rises from their desk and the crowd flows out into one of a few broad corridors where there are snacks and beverages. After fifteen minutes, they return to their desks and resume work. At around noon, everyone makes their way to a cafeteria, grabs a tray and serves themselves a buffet lunch, sits down in a group or by themselves, eats and/or socializes for an hour, then back to the task, and later another break, then more of the same work until five. 

It's a workplace that's basically structured like a staggeringly over-scaled high school. It's not for everyone, and people who are prone to any kind of social anxiety might find aspects of it challenging. But people are generally copacetic and upbeat, and there’s a freedom to the lack of baggage that can lead to very interesting conversations. When all is said and done, it's a gig with clear boundaries that offers subsidized travel, and the pay isn’t bad.

One thing I know we all love is the kind of encounter where you have to walk through a space while people are walking towards you, and you have to decide with each passing person whether or not it's suitable to make eye contact, whether to nod or say a greeting, whether to smile or check internally to make sure that your face remains in a positive-neutral-relaxed position. In this workplace, you have to do this over and over again at regular intervals all day long. This could easily degenerate into constantly assessing your acquaintanceships with people you have previoiusly eaten lunch with, worked at a table with, had drinks with at a reception, etc. Due to the way the projects are set up, you find yourself crossing paths with a lot of the same people, over and over again, each day. 

This was my fourth year participating in this project. After your first year, you start to get to know some of the people who work in your area, in the uniquely limited ways that you can become familiar with people who basically have only this job in common. Most work in related fields, but again, they're coming from all over the place, and people mainly leave their home lives at home. This workplace exists only briefly on an annual interval, and lots of people only do the job once, but certain social networks arise. 

Around three days into the job, I noticed that certain members of the leadership in my area, and people in their general social circle, were...looking at me funny. It's a weird thing to verbalize noticing this, and at first I thought I was just being overly sensitive. The first time I clocked it, it was a person rather high up in the company making this face at me while we were in line at a dinner event. She's a fun, outspoken person, and in the moment, I thought she was just being spontaneously shitty by mocking the polite smile I smiled at her since I didn't have anything clever to say about the salad we were both reaching for. In that particular crowded venue, at her table was an individual I'll call J, and maybe eight other relatively-higher-level people who work in the same project.

By the time I got back to my room that night, three other people from that table had made that face at me as I passed them in various places. As the days went on, I noticed that other people in that group were making the face in increasingly exaggerated ways. While in an elevator, one of the people doing this happened to be in front of me, and I saw him stop a mutual acquaintance who looked like he was turning to talk to me while we waited to reach our floors. Instead of saying anything, he turned to me and made that face too. Both of these guys generally socialized with J. I came to notice that several of the women in J's social circle were not making that particular face at me, but rather seemed to be looking at me with some thing like curious pity when I would pass them. We'd nod or say hi, but they definitely looked like something was off.

Flashback: Three years ago, J was the person who trained me on that job, and monitored my performance with ongoing feedback. This was a stressful process for me, and throughout the days of that session, I was often consciously managing anxiety attacks of varying intensity. Part of the anxiety was knowing that J was keeping an eye on me, as he was everyone else at the table; that was his job. I quickly realized I was fighting the physical aspects of an anxiety attack just about every time we made eye contact. I started managing the anxiety by drawing parallel lines on a post-it pad; the focus of the action helped me regulate, and in a matter of less than a minute I'd be back on task. J is a perfectly nice person, affable and charming, and never did anything to draw attention to my anxiety. 

Next flashback: Two years ago, I was assigned to a different but related task where my workstation was in the neighborhood of J's. I realized that casual interactions with J had continued to create that anxiety response, even though I didn't work with him anymore. I started avoiding him, and when we would pass by in the course of the day, I guess I would either avoid eye contact, or give a sort of closed-mouth, eyebrow-raised nod. At one point, I actually stopped him and apologized for what must have seemed like not being very nice. He was totally cool about it and said he hadn't noticed anything, it was fine. We didn't talk again. 

The next time I saw him was at the beginning of this year's job. I was in a group meeting in a hallway-lounge area when he passed by. As he approached, and we made eye contact, he gave me a distinct look. If that look could be translated into words, it would be: Stay the fuck away from me. I had not seen that expression on his face before; again, he's typically a very easy going, friendly person. The face made my stomach drop. I hadn't expected to be working with him again, since each project is large and people are typically rotated through various projects within the area. I quickly realized that we had been set up at workstations about twelve feet apart from each other. What are the odds, right?

J worked with his back to me when he wasn't walking around to work with his team, and throughout the day, when he needed to discuss things with the leaders in our area, or to leave the room for any other reason, he would pass directly in front of me. I tried to avoid eye contact, and it helped that the glasses I wear at the computer limit my focal range so I can't quite make out facial expressions at a distance of more than twenty feet or so. I tried to just focus on the work, which often involved casual discussion with other people at my table. I did the job, and it was fine. I filled up about a single post-it a day with parallel lines.  I structured my break time and lunch routines to minimize the likelihood of running into him. If I had been a little more aware of what was going on, I think a wide-brimmed hat might have solved some problems. It was inevitable that I would keep passing by this guy multiple times a day and have to do something with my face. I didn’t come up with a conscious strategy, but he did not seem to want to chat, so I did my best to facially project something like “ha ha, it’s OK, this is me leaving you alone!” which I guess looked something like a little closed-mouth smile with raised eyebrows. 

And yes, within a few days, people in J’s circle were making parodies of that face back at me when I would pass them in the building. It was so weirdly aggressive, and so clearly deliberate, that I was at a total loss for how to respond. Otherwise, I talked with other people on the job a perfectly normal amount, and met a lot of really interesting people. I actually had a pretty good time, aside from this nonsense. But this nonsense, I have to tell you, really, really hurt. I hadn’t wanted to be a pain in the ass to anybody. I had received a distinct nonverbal message that I was not welcome, but I could only fuck off so far; I was there to work, like everybody else. 

I don’t know what J told people. I barely know the guy and I don’t know what he is going through in his life. I just know that he didn’t tell me anything; he did not speak to me at all. When we got to the final break time of the last day, I happened to pass him in a hallway. He wasn’t with anyone else, we were face to face, and without having figured out anything to say in advance, this time, I stopped him. As cheerfully and casually as I could, I said something like, “Hey, J, you think you can go the entire job without saying a single word to me? How have you been?” and he kind of laughed and said something like “Oh hey, how are you? How are things in (city where I’m from)?” And I’m looking at his face and seeing this rapid storm of inscrutable micro-expressions, none of which looks anything like it’s moving in the direction of an explanation or an apology. The eyes were saying something more like: what is the crazy bitch going to do?  So there was this silent beat. And I said, “Well, all right, that’s enough.” And I walked outside and across the street and got my coffee. And we went back to our desks and worked another two hours, and the job was over.

I didn’t go to the job closing reception that night, or the after-party, as I hadn’t gone to any of the project’s receptions or meetups since the weirdness had started. I wanted J to know that I wasn’t planning to come back to the on-site job next year, so I caught up with one of our mutual acquaintances as we were walking back to our hotel. I told her that people seemed to have been talking about me, and the way she seemed completely unsurprised told me that what I told her would make it back to J pretty quickly. She has been angling for a higher role in our area. I told her I was switching back to remote work going forward. I also told her this story:

I have a friend who made her career in fairly high-level corporate psychology. One time I was telling her about a problem I was having with a job. She told me: In the workplace, we are not ourselves. We are the roles that we shape ourselves into. Conflicts arise because inside, we’re still ourselves, and the roles we’re working in sometimes just don’t fit right. We want to be ourselves, but the role prevails.

What I hope she understood, and passed on, was that we had been working in a job where all day, fully grown adults were going through actions that structurally mirror a day of high school. So I guess this kind of thing was likely to happen. It did surprise me, though, and I’m still processing it.

1l8kuxe,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1l8kuxe/attic_eyes_the_disappearance_of_kimberly_reese/,“Attic Eyes: The Disappearance of Kimberly Reese”,"Kimberly Reese had just moved into a charming duplex on the edge of town—affordable, quiet, and came with a sweet old landlord who always wore a stained tank top and shuffled like a penguin with one hip replacement. She’d found it on Craigslist, which should’ve been her first red flag, but with rising rent prices and a recent breakup that felt like an exorcism, she was desperate.

It Begins With the Attic 

Her first week was uneventful—aside from the occasional thump in the attic above her bedroom. She told herself it was squirrels. Or maybe raccoons. Definitely not a ghost. Right?

That changed when she came home from a late shift at the bar to find the attic door halfway open. A cold draft slid down the stairs like the breath of a demon with asthma. She stared at the door for a full minute before whispering, “Nope,” and backed out the front door like a reverse Scooby Doo character.

She tried to laugh it off over wine, thinking maybe it didn’t latch properly. But the next day, something was way off. Her bras were stretched out, hanging off the dresser like they’d just run a marathon. One cup even had a coffee ring in it. Who drinks coffee out of a 34B!?

The Panty Incident 

A few weeks later, she returned from a trip to Miami to find a nightmare in her underwear drawer. Every single pair of panties had some kind of white, creamy substance in the crotch. Not laundry detergent. Not yogurt. Something… alive in spirit. To make matters worse, there were coarse dark hairs tangled in the fabric—beard hairs? Pubes? Matted werewolf strands??

She screamed so hard, her Alexa started playing gospel music.

Then came the bed stains. She stripped her sheets to find clear, crusty blotches all over the mattress. It looked like someone had been icing cinnamon rolls with rage and loneliness.

The Calls and Texts 

Then the calls started. A voice whispered, “Nice gray sweatpants...you really shouldn’t sit on your left leg like that... it makes your hip look uneven.”
She’d hang up.
Then a text would follow.

“I just heard you fart. I wish I could put my head under your blankets.”

One night she replied:

“Who the hell are you!?”
The stalker texted back:
“Your biggest fan. Like...real close. 😈”

She unplugged her phone and slept with a knife under her pillow and a plunger next to her bed.

The Screaming Attic 

Weeks later, after a particularly haunting night of wine and paranoia, she heard noises again. Footsteps. Heavy ones. She marched to the attic, heart pounding, ready to curse out whatever spirit or raccoon dared haunt her peace.

Before her hand could reach the knob, she heard it.
A scream. Not human. Not animal. Like a choir of demons stubbing their toes on a bedpost in hell.
She screamed louder and ran out completely naked, breasts flapping like sirens, straight to her neighbor’s house.

Mr. Frank from next door gave her an old bowling shirt and let her call the cops.

The cops came.
They checked the attic.
Nothing.
They thought she was drunk, high, or both. They even checked her recycling bin for wine bottles and whispered about “mental episodes.”

The Packages 

The mail turned from bills to madness.

Letters described her entire day: what she ate, what time she farted, when she scratched her armpit.

One envelope had a Polaroid of her sleeping.

Another had a box of Oscar Mayer hot dogs… each one stuffed inside condoms. Like twisted meaty party favors from the lunatic PTA.

She told friends and family. They took turns staying over. Nothing happened. As soon as she was alone again—it escalated.

The Last Night 

No one was available to stay that night. She drank two bottles of wine, took two Ambien, and passed out fully clothed in bed.

When she woke up, she was naked. Her kitchen light was on.

Then she heard it.
Peeing.
Someone was peeing in her toilet.
The horror hit her harder than the hangover. She vomited in bed from sheer panic.

And then… footsteps.
A dark figure filled the doorframe.
He stepped into the light.

It was her landlord.
Pus-filled, bumpy face. Chest out like a busted meatloaf.
He reeked of boiled sewage and onions left in a hot car.
His eyes were wild.
And he was wearing her bra like a victory trophy.

“You never thanked me…for keeping your rent so low.”

She screamed.
He whispered, “Do you want to see my special collection?”
Before she could respond, he leapt like a fat feral mongoose, punching her three times like he trained with Tyson’s evil twin. She saw lightning, then darkness.

The End? 

Neighbors heard moaning, thumping, and gagging sounds from her attic that night.
The landlord was seen dragging two trash bags to the back of a van and driving off.

Kimberly was never seen again.

If anyone has any information about the disappearance of Kimberly Reese, or if you’ve ever rented from a landlord who smells like drowned possum stew and gives off “panty collector” vibes, contact your local authorities.

And for the love of sanity—check your attic.

I get kidney pain every time I drink anything that it not water.

I get a sharp or pinching, consistent pain for hours after drinking e.g., coffee, tea (including herbal), electrolytes, smoothies, alcohol, juices, etc. 

Another part to this is that when I get stressed, my kidneys ache and it's as if they kick into overgear causing me to pee literally every hour. This is combined with extreme dehydration, but it feels like the water I drink doesn't stick. I end up getting this cold, watery feeling in my bones but I'm still so so thirsty.

* Appliances to bring into the space to ensure that I can still cook/eat well. I'll be purchasing a coffee maker, blender, and rice cooker (I use these regularly now). I've seen some combination countertop ovens/airfryers, which I'm considering purchasing as well.
* How to cope without a freezer. I tend to keep frozen meals/veggies on hand for when there's no time to shop, or I don't feel like cooking. Is there a way around not having one, or an alternative I can bring into the space?
* Kitchen storage/additional furniture (e.g. small islands and the like) which can help maximize space and make the kitchenette more functional.
* How to stock the kitchenette. On my list are a good knife, mixing bowls, cooking utensils, two pans and one pot. I'll sadly have to ditch my large cast iron skillet (I mostly use it in the oven now) and most of my baking tools.

She came to my school last year as exchange student, we were just friends when she was here.

During winter break, I traveled to Japan and she found out we will be at the airport around the same time, I will be heading back to the US while she returning to Japan. So she asked to meet up at the airport and hang out for a bit. After that we stay connected almost daily. She usually replied within the day and sometimes instantly, but was passive and mostly responding most of the time. And if I try to hint something romantic she tried to dodge it or treat it as a joke.

I visited Japan again last month and was able to meet up with her twice during the 3 weeks I was there. We went to her favorite singer’s concert the first time and a casual lunch/coffee the second time. We still keep in communication but her responds are getting shorter or just a thumbs up/笑笑/emoji sticker. So I am not sure if she’s losing interest or just busy (She still in school, with 3 part time jobs and 3 hours commune time from home). 

I won’t say I know everything about Japanese culture but I say I have a good understanding from Japanese friends, family background, Japanese classes I took and even lived in Japan before.

From personally experience, most Japanese people if not interested or felt pressure they will just leave on read or never respond and will never try to meet in person. They make it very obvious. But from our conversation I felt like she just wants to be friends but then her regular response and willingness to find time from her busy schedule to meet up multiple times says the opposite.

Using Toggle Timer to Uncover Your Hidden Time Sinks,"https://preview.redd.it/8ssjs05di86f1.jpg?width=4272&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cfa7c9043b75e136e8c5c9c5d774f3af79aff752

Ever felt like your day just vanished into thin air? One moment you’re sipping your morning coffee, and the next, it’s dinner time, and you’re left wondering, “Where did all that time go?” If this sounds familiar, you’re definitely not alone! Many of us struggle with time management and often lose track of where our hours are slipping away. But fear not! There’s a handy tool that can help you reclaim your time: the Toggle Timer.

# What is Toggle Timer?

So, first things first: what exactly is [Toggle Timer](https://www.toggletimer.com/)? If you’ve never heard of it, let me paint you a picture. Imagine a magical stopwatch that not only tracks how long you spend on tasks but also gives you insights into your productivity. Sounds awesome, right? Toggle is basically a time-tracking app that helps you figure out exactly where your time is going.

# Why Use ToggleTimer?

You might be wondering, “Why should I bother with another app?” Well, let me hit you with a few compelling reasons:

* Awareness is Key: Sometimes, we don’t even realize how much time we waste on trivial tasks. By tracking your time, you become more aware of your habits.
* Improve Productivity: Knowing where your time goes allows you to identify “time sinks,” those pesky activities that drain your hours without offering much in return.
* Set Goals: With Toggle, you can set specific goals for how much time you want to spend on different tasks. It’s like having a personal trainer for your time management!

# How to Get Started with Toggle

# Step 1: Sign Up

Getting started is as easy as pie! Just head over to the[ Toggle website](https://www.toggletimer.com/) and sign up for a free account.

# Step 2: Download the App

Whether you’re a phone addict or a desktop junkie, Toggle has got you covered. Download the app on your preferred device, and you’re ready to roll!

# Step 3: Start Tracking

Now comes the fun part! Start your timer whenever you begin a task. Whether you’re working on a project or binge-watching your favorite show (we all do it!), hit that start button.

# Pro Tips for Using Toggle Timer

* Be Consistent: The more consistent you are with tracking your time, the better insights you’ll gain. Try to track every task, no matter how small!
* Categorize Your Tasks: Create different projects for various types of work. This way, you can easily see where most of your time is spent.
* Review Your Data: At the end of the week, review your time reports. You might be shocked to see that you spent two hours scrolling through social media!

# Real-Life Anecdote

Let me share a little story. A friend of mine, let’s call him Dave, struggled with time management. He’d often complain about feeling overwhelmed and busy, yet never seemed to accomplish much. One day, I convinced him to try Toggle. After just one week of tracking his time, he discovered that he was spending nearly three hours a day on email! Can you believe that? By cutting down on unnecessary email checking, he freed up time for more important tasks.

# Random Facts About Time Management

* Did you know that the average person spends about 2 hours a day on social media? That’s 14 hours a week!
* Studies show that multitasking can actually decrease productivity by up to 40%. So, put that phone down and focus!
* It takes an average of 23 minutes to regain focus after a distraction. Yikes!

# Conclusion



In conclusion, if you ever find yourself wondering, “Where did my day go?” remember that Toggle Timer can be your best friend in uncovering those hidden time sinks. By tracking your time, you’ll become more aware of your habits, improve your productivity, and ultimately reclaim your day. So why not give it a shot? You might just be surprised at what you discover!

Now, go ahead and download Toggle! Your future self will thank you for it!

I've been thinking a lot about morning routines lately, and honestly, for the longest time, mine was just pure chaos. Hit snooze a million times, stumble into the shower, grab a coffee, and feel like I was playing catch-up all day.

But I realized that how you start the day really dictates everything else. I started making some small tweaks, nothing crazy, but focusing on just a few minutes of intentional calm and energy. For me, that meant transforming my shower. I wanted something that wasn't just about getting clean, but about truly waking up, feeling invigorated, and ready to tackle the day.

This pursuit actually led me to develop something (it's called Brogiene – trying to launch it soon, focused on premium men's hygiene, link in profile if you're curious). My favorite part of my new routine is honestly a specific product I've been refining that totally changes my shower game.

**But I'm curious about you guys:**

* Do you have a strict morning routine, or are you more of a 'wing it' person?
* What's one small thing you do in the morning that genuinely makes you feel better or more prepared?

I'm exploring the idea of launching a **hole-in-the-wall espresso bar in Wollongong**. Super stripped back. No seats. No Wi-Fi. No muffins. Just **$2 espressos**, all day, every day.

The concept:

* Takeaway only
* Speed-focused (under 60 seconds per coffee)
* Minimal menu: espresso, long black, maybe batch brew
* $2 flat rate – no gimmicks
* Strong branding, tight system, high volume

It’s been done in Europe. Parts of Sydney. Some success stories, some failures. The model is high-risk, low-margin, but leans into speed, foot traffic, and daily loyalty.

Here’s my question:  
Would Wollongong support this in *this economy*?

* Cost of living’s up. But so are café prices. $5+ for a long black is now normal.
* There’s foot traffic in Crown St, the station, beach strips. But are people in a rush or in a chill café mindset?
* Rent is lower than Sydney. But can you hit 100+ coffees/day consistently at $2?
* Do people *actually want* fast and cheap, or do they still want oat milk, Spotify playlists, and boho tiles?

I’m not interested in fluff. If you think this is stupid, say it.  
If you’d go every day, say that too.  
If you’ve seen someone try this and flop, I want to know.

The Gili Islands, with their pristine beaches and tranquil atmosphere, offer the perfect backdrop for cultivating mindfulness in our daily routines. Embracing mindful mornings through two-minute rituals can significantly enhance your presence, setting a serene tone for the day ahead. Here are some simple yet effective practices that can anchor your consciousness amidst the island's natural beauty.

Start your day with a brief breathing exercise. Take a moment to stand barefoot on the soft sand or a cool tile floor, close your eyes, and focus on your breath. Inhale deeply for a count of four, hold for four, and exhale for four. This two-minute practice not only grounds you but also fosters a deeper connection to your environment, reminding you of the gentle ocean breeze and the rustling palm leaves.

Next, consider a gratitude reflection while sipping your morning beverage. As you sip your coffee or herbal tea, think of three things you appreciate in your life. Whether it's the stunning sunrise over Gili Trawangan or the laughter of friends, this short ritual elevates your mood and directs your thoughts towards positivity.

Afterward, dedicate two minutes to stretching. Find a comfortable spot with a view of the ocean, and engage in gentle stretches that open your body and mind. Focus on your movements and feelings, surrendering to the present moment. This practice not only energizes you but enhances your awareness of your body, connecting you to the natural rhythm of the island.

Finally, spend two minutes in reflective silence. Sit quietly, close your eyes, and simply observe the sounds around you—the waves, birds, and wind. This auditory meditation nurtures a sense of peace and presence, anchoring you firmly in the moment and allowing the beauty of the Gili Islands to inspire your day.

Incorporating these two-minute rituals into your mornings can transform your experience on the Gili Islands, creating a mindful start that resonates throughout your day.

 Last year around June I tested positive for h pylori via breath test after experiencing upper stomach pain (my immediate tested first and then I did) I was given treatment but I didn’t finish it, I can’t remember why this was such a stupid mistake but I had about 4 days left of treatment, dr also did blood work and it was fine. At that time, I hadn’t changed up any of my diet I was drinking coffee with espresso and didn’t switch my diet. I was given the treatment but really no information on how to help heal my gut. 


 I felt better for a bit, then the upper stomach pain returned. And soon after I began to have excessive burping, my old PCP retested me and it was negative he also took blood work again and it came out fine. 
By this time my insurance cut off due to me turning 26 so I had to wait to see another dr. 


Fast forward to this year in May I started with a new pcp who then rested me for h pylori via breath test and more blood work, blood work was good and I tested negative again for h pylori. He did give me PPI, I finished it and seen him again for a follow up last week. He wants me to wait to retest next month again then refer me to GI.

I have been experiencing upper abdominal pain that comes and goes everyday, I still burp all day long every day, and I also feel like my food gets stuck in my chest and as of this week I feel chest discomfort so I’m not sure if it’s because of the food being stuck/ having to go down with water. 

 - I’m tired of the stomach pain, I’m tired of burping every single day, now I’m even anxious to eat because it feels stuck in my chest. I feel so lost, I’ve been dealing with this for almost an entire year. I have diagnosed OCD which is mainly related to my health. My mind goes straight to the ‘C’ word. This has taken over my life, I’m constantly looking up my symptoms (which I know my OCD needs to be controlled), I think about it every single day, I even dream about it. I have a small child, and since I’ve been dealing with this I feel like I can’t focus on raising her. I can’t focus on work, I can’t focus on anything. And I can’t express how much fear and anxiety I have towards this. I think about having to get an endoscopy which I know is the best to diagnose what I am going through, but I freak out thinking about being put to sleep. I have anxiety thinking about a diagnosing like the ‘C’ word. I know I shouldn’t google, I know I’m ruminating but dealing with this pain and symptoms daily has me spiraling. A lot of the symptoms I have range from having h pylori again, gastritis, and even the ‘C’ word for stomach and esophagus. 

As of right now, I’m waiting to RETEST AGAIN for h pylori because I had been taking PPI last month. Then my dr will refer me to GI. But right now I’m in this depressed anxiety hole I cannot get out of. My life wasn’t like this before I took part of the treatment. 💔",3,1749619303.0,ChronicPain,4,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of a commercial water softener is a critical decision,impacting operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The following key features highlight what to consider when choosing the right system for your business.

**Flow Rate Capacity:** This refers to the amount of water the softener can process within a specific timeframe, typically measured in gallons per minute (GPM). Selecting a unit with insufficient flow rate will result in untreated hard water passing through the system, while an oversized unit may lead to inefficient regeneration cycles. A precise calculation of your peak water demand is vital to ensure optimal performance.

The flow rate capacity should be matched to the specific water usage patterns of your business. Such as, a large hotel with high occupancy will require a significantly higher flow rate than a small restaurant. Consider potential future expansion when determining your flow rate needs to ensure the softener can accommodate increased demand. Accurate assessment and selection will optimize both performance and efficiency.

**Regeneration Type:** Commercial water softeners utilize different regeneration methods, including time-clock, metered, and sensor-initiated systems. Time-clock regeneration initiates cycles at pre-set intervals, regardless of water usage. Metered regeneration monitors water consumption and regenerates based on actual demand, offering greater efficiency and reducing salt waste. sensor-initiated systems use advanced sensors to detect resin exhaustion and initiate regeneration onyl when necessary, providing the most accurate and efficient performance.

The regeneration type greatly influences salt consumption and overall operating costs. Metered and sensor-initiated systems are generally more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly compared to time-clock systems due to their ability to adapt to actual water usage. Investing in a more refined regeneration system often results in long-term cost savings and reduced environmental impact.

**Resin Type and Volume:** The resin beads within a water softener are what actually remove the hardness minerals from the water. Different types of resin exist, each with varying lifespans, capacities, and resistance to chlorine and other contaminants. The volume of resin directly affects the softener's capacity to treat hard water between regeneration cycles.High-quality, durable resin with a sufficient volume is essential for consistent and reliable performance.Choosing the right resin type and volume significantly impacts the softener's longevity and efficiency. Look for crosslinked resins, known for their durability and resistance to degradation. Consider the water quality in your area and select a resin that can effectively handle the specific contaminants present. Consulting with a water treatment specialist can definitely help you determine the optimal resin type and volume for your application.**Tank Material and Construction:** The tank's material and construction are critical for pressure resistance, durability, and longevity. Common materials include fiberglass, polyethylene, and steel.Fiberglass and polyethylene tanks are lightweight, corrosion-resistant, and suitable for most applications. Steel tanks offer superior strength and durability, especially under high-pressure conditions. Proper construction,including reinforced seams and robust fittings,ensures leak-free operation and a long service life.

Selecting a tank material that suits your operational environment is crucial. Steel tanks might potentially be preferable in industrial settings with higher pressure requirements, while fiberglass tanks are frequently enough a good choice for lighter commercial applications.Pay attention to the tank's NSF certification, which indicates that it meets stringent safety and quality standards.

**Valve Design and Controls:** The control valve is the ""brain"" of the water softener, managing the regeneration process and directing water flow. Advanced valves offer features such as programmable cycles, digital displays, error code diagnostics, and remote monitoring capabilities. A well-designed valve contributes to ease of use, efficient operation, and reliable performance.

investing in a valve with advanced features enhances the softener's usability and diagnostic capabilities. Programmable cycles enable you to customize regeneration parameters,optimizing salt consumption and water efficiency. Remote monitoring allows you to keep track of the softener's performance and receive alerts for any potential issues. Look for valves with a proven track record of reliability and ease of maintenance.

Key features of advanced commercial water softeners include:

*   High salt storage capacity
*   Durable construction for harsh environments

By removing hardness minerals, a water softener prevents scale formation, extending the lifespan of equipment and reducing the need for costly repairs or replacements.

The savings on maintenance costs can be considerable, particularly for businesses with extensive plumbing systems and multiple water-using appliances. Regular descaling of equipment is expensive and time-consuming. by preventing scale buildup altogether, a water softener can deliver important long-term savings.

**Improved Energy Efficiency:** Scale buildup acts as an insulator, reducing the efficiency of water heaters and other heating appliances. This forces them to work harder to maintain the desired temperature, resulting in higher energy consumption. Soft water ensures optimal heat transfer, reducing energy usage and lowering utility bills.

Improved energy efficiency translates directly into cost savings. Businesses that rely heavily on hot water, such as hotels and laundromats, can see particularly significant reductions in energy consumption. Reduced energy consumption also contributes to a smaller carbon footprint, promoting environmental sustainability.

**Enhanced Water Quality:** Soft water is not only better for appliances; it also improves the quality of water for various commercial processes. It can enhance the effectiveness of soaps and detergents, leading to cleaner laundry, brighter dishware, and improved product quality in manufacturing applications.

Enhanced water quality leads to improved customer satisfaction in service-oriented businesses. Such as, soft water prevents spotting and streaking on dishes and glassware, resulting in a more presentable dining experience. In manufacturing, soft water can prevent mineral deposits from interfering with chemical reactions or affecting product colour and clarity.

**Extended Equipment Lifespan:** Scale formation due to hard water can significantly shorten the lifespan of commercial appliances.A water softener reduces scale formation, contributing to longer appliance life and less downtime.

Extended equipment lifespan translates into savings on replacement costs. Replacing commercial appliances is expensive and disruptive to operations. By protecting appliances from the damaging effects of hard water, a softener ensures better return on investment in key equipment.

**Reduced Chemical Usage:** Soft water enhances the effectiveness of cleaning products, resulting in reducing the need for harsh chemicals.

Reduction in chemical usage promotes both cost savings and environmental responsibility. Many cleaning chemicals have negative environmental impacts. By using less of these chemicals, businesses can reduce their environmental footprint and promote worker safety.

From the get-go, we were super close—people thought we were old friends or had worked together before, but truth is, we had just met.

At first, it was great. We worked really well together, had similar humor, and just naturally got along. But as weeks went by, the dynamic started shifting. He began demanding more from me—longer hours, going the extra mile, things like that. At the same time, he’d buy me coffee before work, give me little gifts, or randomly treat me. It wasn’t anything huge, but it was frequent enough that people noticed.

There was this running joke in the team that I was his “favorite.” And yeah, sometimes it felt like it. I got what I needed quickly, but in return, the pressure was always on me. He expected a lot—like way more than he expected from anyone else. It wasn’t just professional, either. He started expecting me to be emotionally available for him too. Like, I had to listen when he vented, support him when he was stressed, and be “there” for him in a way that didn’t feel like part of my job.

Then things got weirder. A few months in, our relationship turned kind of toxic. We’d have screaming matches during one-on-ones, shut each other out for weeks, and then suddenly be back on friendly terms like nothing happened. It was like an emotional rollercoaster—up and down constantly.

Eventually, he moved to another team and got close with some other coworkers. I heard they were kind of insecure around me because he acted totally different with me—spending money, driving me places, checking in with me constantly. He was usually super frugal, but with me, it was the opposite, and that didn’t sit well with them.

Then one day, he just… left. No goodbye, no heads-up. We were on bad terms again at that point, so I guess I shouldn’t be surprised, but it still hurt. I stayed at the company, and we hadn’t talked for months.

But then—out of nowhere—on my birthday, he messaged me. Just a simple “Happy Birthday.” Nothing else. Like nothing happened. Like we hadn’t gone months without talking. Like he hadn’t just disappeared.

I don’t know how to feel about it. It pulled me right back into that confusing headspace. Part of me misses the friendship we had, but another part of me remembers how stressful and weird it got. It’s just this grey area that I can’t seem to get out of.

I guess I’m just venting. Or maybe hoping someone else can relate. I don’t know.",2,1749618940.0,phlgbt,3,0.67,False
1l8kg4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/1l8kg4t/flying_with_all_nippon_airways_ana_cgk_hnd_cgk/,Flying with All Nippon Airways (ANA) CGK - HND - CGK,"[CGK - HND NH872](https://preview.redd.it/b521efpi486f1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6276c9a0dc7d9e97cb2fd55c665dc1c31448cdba)

Was flying with ANA's 787-8 on a 7-hour flight from CGK to HND roundtrip. Here's what I think about the flight:

**Boarding the Plane**  
I was flying with my wife, flying on economy class. The 787 has 3-3-3 seat configuration on economy class, and 2-2-2 on business. 

Boarding was on time. The boarding procedure is quite unique as they separate the passengers from Group 1 to Group 5. Group 1 is priority, elderly, and other passengers who needs assistance. Group 2 is business class passengers. Group 3 is economy class passengers who seat on the window seat, Group 4 is for economy class middle seat, and Group 5 is for economy class aisle seat. This procedure in my opinion is very efficient as we boarded the plane really quick than the standard procedure that board the passenger by seat number. When you enter the plane, there's a sign that guides you where is ABC - DFG - HJK seats, so the flight attendant doesn't have to check your boarding pass again to guide you to your seat.

On my return flight from HND, they have ""Face Express"" special line, which I highly recommend it as you'll be board before Group 3. 

**The Crews**  
The crews are very effective and efficient. They smiles and communicative as well. On my return flight from HND, there was a passenger who is not feeling well and they moved her to the back of the plane near the toilet, and was taken care of throughout the flight. They serve and take the meals just in time imo, so the meals was not on my table for too long, limiting my movement. They also make sure that some of the passengers pre-booked a specific meal that they offer couple of days before the flight.

The only drawback was, on my return flight, it was an overnight flight. The crews served breakfast on 4 am and woke me up to serve my meal. I remember on Cathay Pacific flight, they gave me some stickers saying ""please wake me up for meal"" and ""please don't wake me up"".

The pilot did a great job on both CGK - HND and HND - CGK flights. Smooth buttery landing that I even didn't notice the touchdown. On both flights, we landed 20 minutes ahead of schedule--which something you rarely heard if you're living in Indonesia.

The ground staff at HND was superb as well. I landed at 16:40-ish, and I was expecting to get out of the airport at 18:00. Guess what time I got my baggage and get out from the arrival hall? 17:30. And both on CGK and HND, they boarded the plane in just like 30 minutes or so. I didn't check exactly how quick they boarded the plane but it felt super quick and smooth. I don't need to ask the passenger on the aisle because they board the plane last.

**The Meal**  
I'd say the looks of the meal wasn't appealing. But it tasted good. I had chicken pasta for both CGK - HND and HND - CGK flight. The CGK - HND one was more like lasagna, and the return flight was like macaroni. Both tasted nice. My wife had rice on both flights, and she likes it. Mind you, she's a picky eater. The salad was okay, and the dessert was fruits on both flights--in which on the return flight it tasted so good. The choice of drinks is decent--some choice of juices, pepsi zero, mineral water, green tea, coffee, beer, and wine. Both same on outbound and inbound flights. Honorable mention, that they use silverware instead of plastic utensils!

**The Lavatory**

[Looks superb.](https://preview.redd.it/ogw93kq3486f1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=daea0161b04d0a78fc2c49c7c03b0818bfca1eb8)

It has to be one of the best economy class lavatory on a plane. The crew did a great job to make the lavatories clean throughout the flight. There are also super-convenient Japanese bidet and baby table on some lavatories.

**The Seats**  
The seats was quite comfy with a good seat pitch. I am 183cm and 89kg and still have some legroom, even when the seat in front of me was reclined. The seat was super clean as well. Headrest's height can be adjusted, and can be bended on its side to help you sleep. The table was clean and doesn't have that ""sticky"" feeling when you touch it. The only drawback was the seat is a bit too narrow, compared to Cathay Pacific, Singapore Airlines, and even Garuda Indonesia. They have USB port under the IFE (which don't work), I didn't look for socket port under the seat because I have my powerbank with me anyway. I didn't get travel kit (eye covering mask, socks, ear plugs) but I didn't get any on my previous Cathay flight (CGK - HKG - NRT roundtrip) and Garuda flight (CGK - HND roundtrip) as well.

Big mention for 787's huge windows. Love it. Now it is wife's favorite plane even though she doesn't know what plane she just flew.

**The Entertainment**  
The Inflight Entertainment (IFE) works really well. The touch screen monitor was super responsive with minimum lag. You still get physical remote as well. The thing that surprised me the most is that I got free wifi even in economy class! The wifi was limited to only chats, which for me works for iMessage, WhatsApp, and Instagram DM. It is not the fastest wifi in the world (like it took ages to send WhatsApp stickers), but this is the first time I got free wifi on economy class.

**The Price**  
I paid around \~US$520 for CGK - HND - CGK flight per person. Considering the distance would be 5,780km one way (11,560km round trip) it cost me only US$0.045 per km (round trip), which is super cheap. And with ANA's standard of service, it worth every penny.

**In Conclusion**  
I highly recommend it. ANA has a high standard and as a 5-star airline (Skytrax), they really delivers. I would say it doesn't have that ""fancy"" feeling like when you're abroad Emirates or Singapore Airlines, but they have their own way to make you feel that you are flying with also a 5-star airline. For me, it is the professionalism of the crews (ground crews, flight attendants, and pilots) that really impressed me. They don't have the best meal, they don't have the best seats, they don't have the best IFE, but in my opinion they have the best crews both on ground and on the plane that works very effective and efficient while still taking care of the passengers really well.

So when someone with a master’s degree and eight years of experience accepts an engineering job for 3,000 AED, why would the company ever consider paying more? They'll hire that person, use them for a couple of years, then replace them with the next desperate candidate willing to accept the same deal.

1l8kee6,https://i.redd.it/b6gaurwue86f1.jpeg,[lessons learned] What do you wish you’d known when starting with Lotus Water?,"Hey all! 

Im just diving into Lotus Water. After my first day I see theres is lots to learn and more nuance than I expected.

If you could go back and talk to your “coffee water newbie” self, what tips or warnings would you give?

I already have questions and would love to hear your insights:

1. Minimum batch size - The Lotus calculator allows batches as small as 250mL, but I keep seeing 950mL mentioned in community recipes. I tried a 400mL batch using Simple & Sweet and got a TDS reading of ~180ppm. Is there a “minimum effective batch” for consistency? Should I always mix in 950mL increments even if brewing smaller volumes?

2. Adjusting for funky/fermented coffees - Im pretty sensitive to fermented, funky, overly processed beans. Which minerals make the cup cleaner, brighter, or less “funky”? What would you decrease or increase to neutralize fermented notes?

3. Dialing in for different coffees - Every bag seems to ask for a different water profile, right?Im curious about how do you test and dial in water recipes per coffee. Do you use a method like Rao & Lance’s “Unlocking Yumtown” video (brewing one 400ml batch from the same distilled base, divided into 4 cups and then adding different minerals afterwards). Do you ever tweak water after the first brew, or do you already have go-to mineral combos for certain origins or roast levels?

4. TDS level vs extraction - Ive heard that higher TDS water leads to higher extraction, but also that brewing with distilled water and remineralizing afterwards yields the same result. What is true here? How does water TDS actually affect extraction and flavor in your experience?

5. Preferred TDS levels per roast or origin - Ive seen people suggest Light roasts 100–120ppm, Medium roasts 120–150ppm and Dark roasts 150–180ppm. *Do you agree with this? What’s your go-to TDS for Ethiopian naturals vs washed Colombians vs anaerobic Brazils? Is there a TDS “sweet spot” for balance and clarity?*

6. Is the aroma affected by different water recipes? - Can minerals affect both aroma and flavor/mouthfeel? but what about aroma? Can mineral composition influence the aroma directly, or only enhance (or mute) how we perceive it? Have you noticed certain minerals helping unlock specific aroma notes in a coffee? Or is aroma more roast/bean dependent?

I know that the two systems have the same bottoms which make their pots and pans compatible. I am just wondering if the pots are the same for the press to work correctly.

I have been dating my boyfriend for about 8 months now. He’s sweet, he brings me iced coffee, and he met my cat, and my cat liked him (which is rare). So like… we’re good.

BUT. The other day, I was on Instagram and I saw that he liked his ex’s story. Not just any story her in a bikini on a boat with some “✨hot girl summer✨” caption.

My stomach dropped. Like, I don’t even know why I checked. I don’t stalk her usually, but Instagram’s algorithm is messy and I just saw it. And there was his little name under it. Boom. Hearted.

So I asked him about it not in a crazy way. I literally said, “Hey, random, but I saw you liked your Ex's story, just wondering what that’s about?” And he goes, “Oh wow, you’re checking my likes now?”

Sir. I wasn’t. The app snitched.

He said I was “blowing it out of proportion,” that it “didn’t mean anything,” and that he “likes everyone’s stories.” (Okay but I checked and he definitely does not like my bikini posts, sooo.)

I told him it made me uncomfortable and that it kind of feels disrespectful. He told me I’m insecure and that it’s just social media, I’m being dramatic, etc.

So now I’m sitting here wondering am I being dramatic? Like, I know it’s just a tap on a screen. But to me, it’s the fact that he saw that photo, paused, and chose to like it. Of all people. His ex.

1. **Use Common Sense: Always Meet in Public**

Always meet in well-lit, public locations such as:

Shopping mall parking lots
Coffee shops or fast-food locations
Police station “safe exchange” zones or banks

NEVER invite strangers to your home

2. **Cash Is Safest: Be CAUTIOUS using E-Transfers with strangers**

Cash is the safest form of payment for in-person transactions.

Be cautious with e-Transfers, as they can be reversed or faked. AVOID clicking suspicious email or links. ALWAYS check your account first. 

Be cautious with e-Transfers unless you’re sure the person is trustworthy. Fake screenshots or emails of “pending payments” are common scams. 

NEVER send payment before seeing the item or to hold an item unless you fully trust the seller.


3. **Inspect Before You Pay**

Always test electronics and inspect items for damage or defects.
Don’t rely solely on photos, confirm the item matches the description in person.
If something seems off, don’t complete the deal.

4. **Do not meet up alone, always bring a friend**

If possible, bring someone with you when meeting a buyer or seller.
Let a friend or family member know where you’re going, who you’re meeting, and when you expect to be back.

5. **Keep Communication on Reddit**

Use Reddit Chat or Reddit Messages to document conversations.
Avoid giving out your personal phone number or email unless necessary.
If someone pressures you to move off-platform quickly, be CAUTIOUS.

6. **Trust Your Instincts**

If something feels wrong, walk away.
No item or deal is worth risking your safety.

7. **Report Suspicious Users**

If someone appears to be running a scam, impersonating a moderator, or engaging in suspicious activity, report them to the mods immediately.
We take safety seriously and will remove or ban users as needed.

8. **Buyers and Sellers Assume All Risk**

This subreddit is a public marketplace. Moderators DO NOT guarantee the legitimacy of listings and are not responsible for losses, scams, or disputes. Participate at your OWN risk.

1l8k8jj,https://www.reddit.com/r/managers/comments/1l8k8jj/gossipy_work_environment/,Gossipy work environment,"So the long and short of it is that I was working with another employee (let’s call him David) a few weeks ago. I am a manager from a different team than this employee, who is an assistant manager on that team. I was working at his site to help provide coverage, and while I was there, David was on his phone the entire shift and even disappeared for about an hour while on the clock. He was watching Netflix, taking phone calls, just generally being loud. Even when a client came up to the office to ask for his assistance, he was on his phone during the whole conversation and barely providing help. 

Since I am not his manager not was I assigned to act in the capacity of that facility’s shift manager that day, and given that he is an assistant manager and should know better, I did not say anything to him, but after giving it more thought and thinking about how annoyed the client had seemed, I sent an email to my manager and admin letting them know what happened. I provided timestamps to check on the cameras and elaborated about my hesitation/decision not to correct him given that he is not my employee, as well as asking for clarification for the future about whether I can administer corrective action to another team’s employees if ever in similar circumstances.  We had all recently signed an updated customer service policy anyways, so the policy about not being on his phone all the time and not abandoning the front desk/wandering (which are basic policies to begin with) were fresh in mind, leaving no excuse.

David got in trouble and is now gossiping about me at work, as I am temporarily relocated to their facility for a project. One of the other managers (same job title as me), Jessica, continued to gossip to other staff about me, saying that it “looks unprofessional” for me to be working at the front desk today with our part time employees right next to her office — which I had to do because I am temporarily relocated and have no desk of my own to work out of, and there is ample desk space at that station. I’m not worried about Jessica’s claim of unprofessionalism- it frankly sounds like she’s just insecure that I’m making it apparent how little she is doing by working near her since we have the same job title (she is the type to have one document open on her computer the whole day and take frequent coffee/water cooler breaks). What I am trying to figure out is how to nip this in the bud since I’ll be at this facility for the next two months.

I will mention that I copied my admin on the email as well because David and my boss are extremely close (good old boys club situation), and I wanted to make sure that I was covering my own backside if the client submitted a complaint to our admin. My boss has also been partaking in some of the gossip, so you can imagine the sort of work culture.

I’ve posted on this thread before but I really need some insight. I am working with my new PCP but he doesn’t seem like that much help. 

 Last year around June I tested positive for h pylori via breath test after experiencing upper stomach pain (my immediate tested first and then I did) I was given treatment but I didn’t finish it, I can’t remember why this was such a stupid mistake but I had about 4 days left of treatment, dr also did blood work and it was fine. At that time, I hadn’t changed up any of my diet I was drinking coffee with espresso and didn’t switch my diet. I was given the treatment but really no information on how to help heal my gut. 


 I felt better for a bit, then the upper stomach pain returned. And soon after I began to have excessive burping, my old PCP retested me and it was negative he also took blood work again and it came out fine. 
By this time my insurance cut off due to me turning 26 so I had to wait to see another dr. 


Fast forward to this year in May I started with a new pcp who then rested me for h pylori via breath test and more blood work, blood work was good and I tested negative again for h pylori. He did give me PPI, I finished it and seen him again for a follow up last week. He wants me to wait to retest next month again then refer me to GI.

I have been experiencing upper abdominal pain that comes and goes everyday, I still burp all day long every day, and I also feel like my food gets stuck in my chest and as of this week I feel chest discomfort so I’m not sure if it’s because of the food being stuck/ having to go down with water. 

 - I’m tired of the stomach pain, I’m tired of burping every single day, now I’m even anxious to eat because it feels stuck in my chest. I feel so lost, I’ve been dealing with this for almost an entire year. I have diagnosed OCD which is mainly related to my health. My mind goes straight to the ‘C’ word. This has taken over my life, I’m constantly looking up my symptoms (which I know my OCD needs to be controlled), I think about it every single day, I even dream about it. I have a small child, and since I’ve been dealing with this I feel like I can’t focus on raising her. I can’t focus on work, I can’t focus on anything. And I can’t express how much fear and anxiety I have towards this. I think about having to get an endoscopy which I know is the best to diagnose what I am going through, but I freak out thinking about being put to sleep. I have anxiety thinking about a diagnosing like the ‘C’ word. I know I shouldn’t google, I know I’m ruminating but dealing with this pain and symptoms daily has me spiraling. A lot of the symptoms I have range from having h pylori again, gastritis, and even the ‘C’ word for stomach and esophagus. 

As of right now, I’m waiting to RETEST AGAIN for h pylori because I had been taking PPI last month. Then my dr will refer me to GI. But right now I’m in this depressed anxiety hole I cannot get out of. My life wasn’t like this before I took part of the treatment. 💔",1,1749618133.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

The ragu is:
- 500g diced venison, coated in seasoned flour
- 1 onion, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/4 cup gin (I use the Dasher + Fisher Mountain gin which is from Tasmania, but use what makes you happy)
- 500g veal stock
- 1 tsp allspice
- 1 tsp porcini powder
- 1 star anise
- a few juniper berries
- 1/2 tsp kampot pepper (I like the heat from this variety but normal pepper is fine)
- salt to taste

The gremolata is just the zest of a lemon, a chopped clove of garlic, parsley, and some pecorino.

Brown the meat and set aside. Add onion and garlic and saute until soft. Deglaze with gin. Add spices and stock. Simmer in the oven with a lid on until tender, about 2 hours.

I feel so lost, I’ve been dealing with this for almost an entire year. I have diagnosed OCD which is mainly related to my health. My mind goes straight to the ‘C’ word. This has taken over my life, I’m constantly looking up my symptoms (which I know my OCD needs to be controlled), I think about it every single day, I even dream about it. I have a small child, and since I’ve been dealing with this I feel like I can’t focus on raising her. I can’t focus on work, I can’t focus on anything. And I can’t express how much fear and anxiety I have towards this. I think about having to get an endoscopy which I know is the best to diagnose what I am going through, but I freak out thinking about being put to sleep. I have anxiety thinking about a diagnosing like the ‘C’ word. I know I shouldn’t google, I know I’m ruminating but dealing with this pain and symptoms daily has me spiraling. A lot of the symptoms I have range from having h pylori again, gastritis, and even the ‘C’ word for stomach and esophagus. 

As of right now, I’m waiting to RETEST AGAIN for h pylori because I had been taking PPI last month. Then my dr will refer me to GI. But right now I’m in this depressed anxiety hole I cannot get out of. My life wasn’t like this before I took part of the treatment. 💔",1,1749618028.0,HPylori,0,1.0,False

I absolutely wrecked my stomach trying to manage school, raising my daughter, full time work, and family life a couple of years ago. I now am left with bad acid reflux & bloating. I was taking Omeprozole 20 mg for an about two years which worked great until recently where I felt dizziness/lightheadedness and it was like my eyes couldn’t focus?? Since I stopped taking it my symptoms have faded, but I’m still trying to manage my acid reflux. 

Dr prescribed me 5mg metoclopramide & I have yet to try to see if that helps, but the possible side effects have made me so nervous to try. Online says depression, potential irreversible muscle spasms, and exhaustion can be symptoms. 

Has anyone had any luck curing their GERD without any medications? I’ve researched supplements and herbs, but some days are miserable. 

I have two kids to raise and I’m working full time, so dealing with stomach issues have been SUPER inconvenient especially since coffee is the only thing that gets me through the day & sometimes coffee destroys my stomach 😅

I’ve been working at this Cafe for almost 18 months, I am the head Barista, and staff and customers both see me as a manager. The previous owners opened a new cafe in early November of last year and decided a bit over a month ago to sell the old one to reduce stress which is totally understandable. 
I met the new owners a couple of weeks ago and mentioned wanting to move my career up and becoming a manager, and they said they’d absolutely look at it moving forward. 
Today i found out that one of the people the new owners hired, is the manager? This girl has barely introduced herself to any of my current staff or myself, hasn’t interacted with any of the customers in any way, and set up the POS system… Which 10 minutes before open yesterday, I found out barely had the coffee set up on it. When I approached the new manager about it she said “oh, ah, just put it in manually”.
WHAT?
Anyway this entirely new POS format was set up by me with very limited understanding of how the system works in about half an hour. 
The only acknowledgment I got from the new owners was “Yeah, old owners said you were good at that stuff”

This time is different.



The day started with us looking for the most crowded cafe in our neighborhood. After a few drinks we had beef tartare, multiple orders or escargot, steaks/frites, grilled octopus, and radishes with butter. Oh and bread... four baskets of the wonderful French bread we have missed so dearly.



Next we meandered through busy streets, in and out of interesting shops, and down towards the Opera and The Louvre. It was warm in the afternoon so we took refuge in the shade of the beautiful trees at Tuileries and sprawled out on the grass while the young ones in our family did cartwheels and chased one another.



After further exploration we had an afternoon snack of ice-cream and coffee. There were so many options so we just picked the one that had the most customers.



Eventually we would ride the Metro back to our neighborhood where we enjoyed a long dinner, many drinks, and amazing people watching.



We had no agenda, no reservations, and nothing to cross off any lists. I know everyone is not able to experience Paris this way but if you can I highly recommend it. The magic of the city really shows itself when you surrender yourself to its delights.

“My global goal is to capture every culture,” the photographer says. ""Of course, this is impossible, as there are up to 10,000 different ethnicities on the planet, and it takes a lot of time to get to the most remote corners where authenticity, culture and traditional lifestyle are still alive.

""Over the past 50 to 70 years, there has been a tremendous shift towards globalisation. The world is becoming less diverse - we all use iPhones, drink coffee at Starbucks – be it in Moscow, New York or Bangkok. As a result many ethnic minority groups are going towards total extinction.

1l8jvy0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_YouthfulHermitess/comments/1l8jvy0/bit_by_bit_i_played_the_midnight_game_and_this_is/,Bit by Bit (I played the Midnight Game and this is what happened),"***Rules of the Midnight Game (according to*** [***r/nosleep***](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fl07l/the_midnight_game_rules_explained/)***):***

***Step 1:*** *If you are playing the midnight game, you must first write your full name on a piece of paper. Then you must use a sharp object to place a single drop of your blood onto the paper.*

***Step 2:*** *Place the paper behind a closed wooden door (an entrance door is preferred but not necessary).*

***Step 3:*** *Light a candle.* 

***Step 4:*** *Knock on your chosen door exactly 22 times (the 22nd knock must happen at 12:00 AM or the ritual will not work.)*

***Step 5:*** *Open your door, blow out the candle, and then close it. You have now summoned and welcomed the “Midnight Man.” Immediately relight your candle.*

***Step 6:*** *Your goal for the rest of the game is to evade the Midnight Man.*



I followed every step. I went to the store, bought a thick white candle plus a couple of backups, two lighters, a box of matches with individual books, and a large carton of salt. I went home, read the lengthy online directions again just to make sure I had it right, and then I waited.

For the rest of the day, I stayed home and paced next to the door leading to my basement. I figured it was the best spot use for the ritual. I couldn’t leave once the game began, and my house only had two floors and the basement. I figured that if I started at the bottom, the only place I could go was up. I laughed out loud, but it didn’t make me feel any better.

My stomach would plummet to the floor every time I checked my watch, seeing that each hour flew by as fast as my thoughts. By nine o’clock that night, I was already tired, my muscles too taut to relax. I felt like a dancer in a music box with her key being twisted every minute, her spring so far past tight that one more twist would snap it, shattering her.

At ten o’clock, I nearly blacked out from fear, my eyes dry and tired. When I first knew I had to play, my normal sleep pattern stopped. I had been up for three nights, with an hour nap on the bus in between. That wasn’t smart, but neither was what I would do in a few hours. At least on the bus the threat was something I could probably deal with. I looked at the wooden door, and my supplies on the small stand next to it. I knew I couldn’t deal with what had to be done. What I had done to force myself into playing this game. In all honestly, I hadn’t been sleeping well for a lot longer than three nights.

At eleven I started to shake. I couldn’t take the anticipation. My body couldn’t comprehend the threat, but knew something was wrong, something was happening, and I couldn’t handle the pressure. Every time I paced in front of the door, my foot hitting the one creaking floorboard near the top step, stars clouded my vision.

At eleven thirty, I began to sweat, beads rolling down my skin, covering me in a shroud of discomfort. I paced faster and faster as the grandfather clock in the living room ticked out each second; the only sound in the emptiness of my little house. Every time I turned towards the kitchen I could see the night out of my back door. It was too opaque, the glass looked as if someone painted it black, but I felt as if someone was out there in that inky color, just waiting for the game to begin.

At a quarter to, I gave my repetitive movements a purpose, and went from room to room, making sure every door and window was locked, and that every single light was out, bathing the house in a deeper darkness to match the outside. At ten minutes to, I turned the kitchen light off and sat in front of the basement door with my supplies beside me. 

When I was little, and couldn’t sleep, I’d hide in my closest tucked behind a deflated kickball and old snow boots. I would close the door, the silence and darkness complete, comfortably wrapping itself around me. I was such a light sleeper, the cars rumbling down the alley were too loud, and the streetlamp on the corner streamed into my bedroom window, illuminating everything. I would try to force my eyes closed and forget about the outside sounds, but I couldn’t hold them shut for long. So I would sit in the vacuum of my closet, with my eyes wide and staring, not seeing a thing. They would grow heavy soon enough, the cancellation of the world calming me down, letting me rest. I tried to calm down in front of that door but I knew I was dangling by a thread, time running out. Nothing could distract me long enough to relax, but I stared anyway, knowing fully well that it could be the last time I would sit alone in the dark.

When I checked my watch again, and saw I had less than five minutes to midnight, I broke from my tenuous reverie. My hands shook as my heart beat faster than I thought it could, but as I lit one of the candles, and readied a small knife that used to be my mother’s, I could feel my thoughts sharpening. “I will survive tonight,” I whispered over and over again, a meditative mantra on loop in the back of my head as I took a pencil, and wrote my name on piece of paper. “Margret Alice Andrews,” it read in a cursive print that would make any calligrapher jealous.

I was named for my grandmothers, both dead, but more like me than I would ever fully understand. I hesitated only once before pricking my pointer finger with Ma’s knife, letting a few drops fall on my name. I placed the candle on top of it, and made sure I put my knife on the stand with the backup supplies before putting my main lighter, and book of matches in my jean pockets. I slowly stood up, kept an eye on my watch to make sure I timed everything correctly, and then started to knock.

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,

My knocks didn’t reverberate through the silence like I thought they would. They sounded close, immediate, so near I wanted to cry.

7, 8, 9, 10, 11,

Halfway there, and I didn’t think I could do it anymore, My insides matching my outside, and by shaking and breaking down.

12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,

I thought I could hear a noise at the bottom of the basement stairs. It was a soft, but noticeable footfall on the bottom step,

18,

And on the next step,

19,

And on the next three,

20, 

The next five,

21,

The next six,

22.

The grandfather clock chimed the hour, and even though I was prepared for this sudden shock of noise, my knees buckled out from under me. I caught myself on the door before falling completely, my head so close to the basement door that I could hear every noise on the other side of the thin wood. He was on the top step, his breath labored, the sounds of a mouth, or a maw, opening and closing with sickly stickiness. I knew he was not breathing so heavily from exhaustion. I steadied myself then, anger and fear welling into determination. I pulled open the door to the black opaqueness of night and nothing else. I saw no one. I waited, and in a few seconds that seemed so slow because of the adrenaline pumping in my veins, the candle blew out in front of me, the door slamming shut in my face. He was in. The game was on.

In a split second, I grabbed the candle from the floor, relit it faster than I thought possible, and scooped up the carton of salt. I then bounded up my living room stairs situated near my basement door, and onto the second floor, making a bee-line to my room, closing and locking the door behind me. Next to my living room, the master bedroom was the biggest in the house, and included a master bathroom, which made up the entirety of the second floor besides one stuffy storage room at the end of the hall. Earlier that day, I threw a case of water bottles and a few bags of snacks in the bedroom making it my unofficial base of operations.

I had until 3:33am for him to leave, so long term preparation was key. I knew he would come up at any time, be it an hour or a few seconds, time meaning so much and so little to a being like him, but I planned to always come back to my room wherever he tried to get me. It was my safe zone. Or so I hoped. In my scared haze, I accidentally stepped on my cat’s bed that was next to my own, and felt a sense of relief that my Little One, an orange tabby, was safe at my mother’s house far away from the thing stalking me in the dark. I sat gingerly on my bed, placing the carton of salt on my nightstand, eyes glued to door. My heart didn’t calm, but went faster, my thoughts centered on the present moment. All I could do was stare, barely blinking, barely breathing. I could feel my throat going dry, but didn’t have the courage to move towards the case of water just left of me, next to the closet door. My fear stuck me to the bed, and I had to repress the feeling of hiding under the blankets.

I couldn’t believe that I made it so far already. While I always loved the occult, it found a way to send a shiver up my spine when I thought about anything out of my plane of existence. It was so tenuous, so easy to screw up, especially with magic. One missed step in a spell to attract love could turn into a spell to hurt someone you love. And those things that could hurt you were much worse compared to humans. Humans could lack consciences, but the thing I let into my home lacked a soul.

Like magic, there were certain rules to the game I was forced to play, and when the window behind me started to crack, ice creeping up its surface, and every other item in the room, I knew he was near. My candle flickered once, twice, and gutted out on the third, the sound of someone blowing it out echoing in my head. I had ten seconds to relight it. I panicked. The long wait left me dazed, not in control of the body that unwound itself without my knowledge as I focused on the door. It felt like I wasn’t attached to it anymore, my head moving faster than my hands. My thumb was useless rubber as I tried to turn the spark wheel on the lighter. I couldn’t do it. My covers started to frost over, and I could see my own breath, but my hand couldn’t start a flame. My floorboards creaked, either from the cold or the man who walked on them, invisible to my eye, but I still couldn’t light it.

I shot up, and with my legs turned to stilts, I tripped on my Little One’s bed this time, and fell to the icy floor. The candle and lighter both fell out of my hands. I managed to grab the candle before it rolled out of my reach, but the lighter was forever lost, and my backup was on the stand next to the basement door. I took the book of matches from my pocket, freezing cold seconds turning to hours. The creaks got louder, sounding more and more like fevered steps. I ripped out at match, folded the book and struck it, the light coming to life. I lit the candle once more, and the floor around it immediately melted, the temperature returning to normal. The door to the bedroom flew open and slammed back so hard that it released from its hinges, and fell to the floor. I could hear a grinding growl reverberate as he ran down the hall.

I was playing by the rules, and he was getting mad. The next time wouldn’t be so easy. I got to my halting feet, and picked the candle up with still cold fingers. My body finally caught up with my brain, so I grabbed the salt and ran downstairs, giving up on the first lighter. The stand next to the basement door was knocked over. When I looked down to find my backup lighter, I saw that the paper with my given name and blood on it was burned to nothing but ashes that didn’t even smolder. I found the other lighter underneath the mess, and taking my two other candles off the floor as well, but leaving the knife since it was useless against a threat like him, I crossed back to the living room, an open space in full view of the stairs that lead up to the second floor.

I went to a chair in the corner that gave me the best view of the landing, and the clock. It was a few minutes after one. After a while of sitting on the comfy chair, the clock’s rhythmic tick tock steadied my own beating heart, and I found my body was relaxing again, each muscle loosening as if on command. The tension I built within myself was just too much, and I couldn’t keep it going all night. My mind felt it too, heaviness seeping up into my neck, bending my head, and relaxing my eyes. It was an intoxicating feeling of utter release, pure euphoria. I moved my eyes to the candle on my lap that tipped more and more as I felt lighter and lighter. The hot wax dripped onto my bare thighs, but it didn’t bother me. When it fell to the floor with an audible thunk, I closed my eyes at last, giving myself over to the sound of the clock.

The next thing I remember was my body falling. I woke up suddenly, jerking myself upright. The candle next to my feet was out, and not smoking. I looked at the clock. It felt like hours since I closed my eyes. It felt like seconds. It was a minute. A full minute. I broke the rules, and my heart dipped to the floor with the life of the candle. All was quiet, but that was the most deceiving thing of all. “He wouldn’t leave me alone,” I thought. There was no way. 

I picked the candle up, and relit it with the extra lighter. I lit the other two as well, and placed them on the coffee table a few inches in front of me. I got up and pushed the table towards the front window, creating a large enough space in between the TV and the sofa. I took my salt next, and methodically made a thick circle of the stuff around me. Then I placed the two back up candles next to the circle, grabbed my original candle, threw the empty carton of salt on the couch, and sat down in the center of my protective circle.

I was sweating and shaking again, my mind pulling apart from the stress. I rocked in the middle of the salt circle thinking to myself: “If he gets me, he’ll take me, bit by bit. If he gets me, he’ll take me, bit by bit.” My mother warned me that he had tricks to do this, that when he was mad, when he saw that I could handle myself, he’d find a way. “If he gets me, he’ll take me, bit by bit.” The clock chimed the half hour, and went through me like lightening. I could only rock more, my body becoming a tight ball of anticipation.

At two in the morning, the clock struck again, and I shook like I would never be warm again. If I played by the rules, I would be free of him at 3:33am, but because I fell asleep…I didn’t want to think what was brewing because of my mistake, and I wasn’t naive enough to think he left.

Even if I made it through the night, The Midnight Man, as Ma called him, would never leave me. “He’ll be in your dreams, Baby. Always there.” I couldn’t even think that far ahead while rocking away another wave of fear and nausea. I didn’t know how long it would take, but he would be there. He’d play his final card, finishing the game any way he could. When I heard a cat scream from the kitchen, I knew he found his ace.

The wails were my Little One. Loud, screeching howls that made my stomach hollow, and filled my throat with bile. They weren’t the sounds my safe, happy cat made when she purred next to me in bed all night. They were long and torturous. Whatever was happening to the tiny creature was killing it, and I swear I could feel my cat’s pain in every inch of her failing body, but if I moved from that circle he would take me, bit by bit. When I heard a tearing sound like wet paper, and the smell of blood started to waft through the living room, I threw up.

Nothing but the heavy liquid sticking to my throat came out. In the candle light it looked too dark, not bile at all, but thick and viscous. I gasped and coughed up the mess for at least a full minute, and with one final push it all came out, a river of sick that dissolved the salt in front of me. When I could breathe again, wiping the tears from my eyes, I almost threw up whatever was left inside because my purge was covered in mats of orange tabby fur.

I screamed and ran with my first candle, making my way to the stairs only to stop again. My lungs froze, breaths coming out in quick puffs as I stared at the nothingness in front of me. I knew he was on the landing. I could feel a vibration that started at my toes and slowly climbed up my spine, but I couldn’t see him. All I saw were two family portraits hanging in dark frames at the top of the stairs and nothing more. Trying to push past this new anxiety, I started up the stairs to get back to my safe haven. Unfortunately, my first instinct was correct. A tall form materialized from the pictures, his outline, the color the frames behind him. He was there but not, his indistinct body shifting to match the color of my walls, and the smiling faces of a photo taken at some family event in the past. He growled again, low and guttural, a sound so deep and vicious it felt its way through the soles of my feet, sticking me to the bottom of the stairs with nowhere to run.

When I saw him for what he was, I suddenly remembered that my Little One was with my mother. Safe. I pulled my eyes away from him to look back at my ruined salt circle, but it was still intact. The two other candles were still flickering around it, my vomit nonexistent. Without turning back to the snarling trickster, I ran to the last place I could go, the basement. He pursued me, loping down the stairs, his anger so great that there was no subtlety left to give me the creeps. He was all rage, all fire. He bounded down wooden stairs that splintered with each step. He tore my other picture frames down off the wall in a tumble of glass, ripping the photographs I once took myself. He kicked through the front door at the bottom of the stairs, before rounding onto the living room.

I started stepping down to the basement as he ripped through the room like a tornado, destroying my circle, and everything else, once and for all. The sound of his snarls and destruction nearly sent me head long down the stairs but I was able to steady myself. I ended up missing the last stair though, and fell to the concrete basement with a bang. I landed hard on my knees, but made sure to hold out the candle in front of me. “You can only go down from here.” fluttered briefly through my mind. I looked at my watch by the light of the flame, and knew it was over. I had a half an hour to go with nowhere to run. I started to cry in chest bursting sobs, the thought of my inevitable death overwhelming. I always knew that there was a chance I wouldn’t make it, but I pushed that thought far away from my consciousness, leaving my nightmares to make up for it in spades. Nothing compared though to the moment I finally understood that I lost the Midnight Game.

I dared to look up at the top of the stairs. I could barely see his heaving nebulous form at the doorway, a dark shadow waiting to overtake me completely. “He will take me bit by bit.” He came down the stairs much slower than when he came up, taking his time, relishing the moment I would unequivocally be his, but as he made his way down his form shifted and changed again, getting shorter, thinner, and more solid. His breathing slowed too, and sounded higher than before, not like a man’s. On the last six steps I smelled rosewater, and I stared in awe from the dirty concrete floor of my basement as my Grandma Alice came down to meet me.

She smiled at me the way she always used to, and bending like she was going to kiss me on the head, Grandma Alice blew out my candle, leaving me in the darkness.

\*\*\*

When I came to, it was still dark, and the only thing I could hear was my heart beating in my ears. I trembled all over, and was still covered in a sheen of sweat. It took me a while to get the courage to hit the button on my watch to check the time. If he was still in my house, I would be breaking another rule by using an unnatural light source. I hoped and prayed as the watch lit up. 3:34 am. I laughed out of shock. Sputtering and coughing, I pushed myself up to a sitting position, the dead candle falling from my hands. I started to cry again.

“I shouldn’t be alive.” I said, finally breaking the unnatural silence. My relief over that fact turned to guilt, and as I sobbed, I thought of Grandma Alice. My grandmother was always full of magic. It ran in the family. They all practiced it in her home, but she would tell me that I was especially gifted. My magic was strong and precise, learning from youth that one small mistake could cost a huge price.

That is until I messed up on a spell for love. A spell built out of an obsession for a man who didn’t belong to me, if I’m being honest. I was lonely and blinded, and all it took was one overlooked fact, one missed step, and the price was my grandmother’s life for a spell that didn’t even work. It had been two months to the day when my family coven told me that I had to play the game. My punishment for carelessness, and for wanting something I shouldn’t have. “It’s only fair, baby. A life for a life.” my mother told me when she picked up Little One’s carrier the day before I played the game. I cried even harder, but the relief of getting that man out of my house was too much to take sitting down.

I stood up and my legs were beyond stiff. Even in the pitch black, I figured I was still at the bottom of the stairs on the basement. In the excitement and pain of winning the Midnight Game, I took a step to start walking up the stairs, but as I did I heard an all too familiar creak. Before I realized what happened I stepped down hard on my large white candle that pushed itself out from under my waiting foot. I slipped and fell backwards. I miscalculated again. Instead of being at the bottom of the stairs, I was left at the top, on the floor leading into my kitchen, the open door and flight of steps behind me. I fell fast, hitting the first step,

The next step, 

The next three,

The next five,

The next six,

And landed on the concrete bottom, blacking out entirely.

\*\*\*

I only learned what happened next when my mother was willing to tell me what she saw through fits of sobs. Ma used my extra key to let herself into my home with cat carrier in hand. The long haired tabby let out a soft mew, sniffing the familiar scent of her home when they entered the living room. Ma sucked in her breath when she saw the circle of salt on the floor, and the two burnt out candles surrounding it. She put the cat down immediately, and ran up the stairs where my photographs hung neatly on the wall, the two at the top group shots from a recent family reunion.

She went straight to the bedroom and opened the door, finding everything in order, but I was nowhere to be found. She checked the adjacent bathroom, and storage room before flying back downstairs, her heart running faster than her feet. The tabby cat was growing as frantic as my mother, clawing at the carrier to be let out, but Ma was too nervous to release the Little One, and could only run to the kitchen, and down to the basement without any luck besides a fallen table and her old ceremonial knife.

She started crying in panic as she searched the first floor once more, groaning out my name with no luck. She finally let the cat out of her carrier as she grew hysterical. Little One bolted up the stairs, yowling all the while. Ma followed the cat as fast as she could. The cat skittered right past the open door of my bedroom and straight to my bedroom closet, scratching wildly at the door. Ma ran over to the Little One, and putting her ear to the closet door, she heard a soft moan come from inside. She pushed aside the case of water that was against it, and opened the door to find me, tucked behind my snow boots, my eyes wide open, my brain in shambles, and my legs twisted and contorted at odd angles.

I was rushed to the hospital, but it was too late. my legs were beyond repair, torn and smashed nearly to a pulp, and needed to be amputated before an infection set in. I don’t turn my lights off anymore, and haven’t thought of using magic since. Even through the glare of the lamp on my nightstand though, he’s still there, composing himself from the slick wooden floor next to my bed and from the slats of my closet door. He hides behind my eyes and I know no peace. What I do know now is that I will never skip a step, break a rule, and I will never play a game with the Midnight Man ever again.

The Slinger made his way to the nearby plains, according to the list, giant garbage had begun to pile up, and needed to be dealt with. Taking stock of all of the garbage the Slinger was pulled toward a giant pile of coffee grounds. The Slinger dropped to his knees, clutching his head, it was as if someone had caved his skull in with a freight train. The only thing the Slinger could coherently think was a single word. A word that at that moment held the entire universe together.

The Slinger passed out from the pain, his entire world going dark. He dreamt of using pasta based magic, and of fighting a cult of pasta worshipers. He dreamt of a massive Beanstalk, one so large that it held the universe itself aloft. The Slinger awoke, bleary eyed, and dizzy. His eyes refocused, but what the Slinger saw chilled him to his core. It was a massive Beanstalk, just like the one he dreamt of. Steadying himself, the Slinger rose to his feet, dusted himself off, and took note of how the plains had been cleared of garbage. Strange occurrences were nothing new to the Slinger, the west seemed to be an ever shifting place, nothing ever followed the same rules for long. Accepting that the job was done the Slinger moved onto his next task.

Thank you to Zasqdddas, and Scoobi Doo Noodles for the continued generosity, I should be out of ronin after tomorrow, meaning that Thursday's post should be the big box opening.

Dropping a little hint at some of the Bean lore, but nothing exact. I'd love to hear some of your guys thoughts about how the Beanstalk is tied to everything. I felt having a bit of mystery would be more fun than another breakdown of how I did the giant castle, but if you guys would prefer a more accurate play by play of events let me know.

It really broke me. I slowly stopped doing the things I loved reading, painting, even wearing the little chains I used to wear with all my outfits. I barely talked to anyone except one close friend. I think I was punishing myself more than healing.

Months went by like that… until that one close friend’s wedding. M was there too.

And somehow, we ended up talking again. We laughed, we danced, we spent time together like nothing had ever gone wrong. It felt nice. Familiar. Comforting.

One night at the cocktail party, I think I told him (maybe without realizing how it would sound) that a married coworker has been asking me out to coffee and lunch. M got upset—protective even. He said he’d help me deal with it. Since then, we’ve been talking again.

But now I’m confused. He checks in, talks to me, offers to help… but I don’t know why he’s doing it. It doesn’t feel like he wants to come back. It just feels like he’s being kind because he sees I’ve been alone. And I can’t tell if it’s care, guilt, or something else.

I’m scared I’m reading too much into this. I’m scared I’m falling for someone who’s just being nice because he feels sorry for me.

Am I overreacting for feeling this way?
