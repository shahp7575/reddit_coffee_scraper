I have a doctors appointment on Monday. It‚Äôs the earliest I can get but I‚Äôm freaking out a bit with googling my symptoms (rookie mistake) and after some guidance to what this could be.

Apologies for graphic description in advance. 

I sometimes have light brown discharge for one or two days when I‚Äôm ovulating, but I‚Äôve noticed after ovulation that the discharge got a lot darker brown, and almost like a coffee grain appearance within the discharge. I have noticed too now that when I wipe after I pee, the urine on the tissue looks very light pink, but the discharge in my underwear is brown. I‚Äôm so confused and this has now been happening for over a week. I‚Äôm about 6 days out from when I‚Äôm due my next period.

The day before you die, the itch will come back in full force to hurry things along.

His task is this: streak naked in front of a crowd of people numbering exactly 50,000 while drunk and in the process offending  in order: Ireland, the Pope, the British on their use of incorrect English, finishing off with a tirade on why football is better than soccer, the futility of drinking tea over coffee and to do the big finish, vomit on the Mona Lisa and pee on Big Ben before leaving a Cleveland steamer under the Arc de Tromph. If you fail, you are cursed with a jock itch so powerful that you will need to sleep on ice to get any form of relief. Men will want to cut their balls off in the middle of the night and women will have to end up wearing icy underwear. 

If you succeed, you will likely be hunted down and killed by one or more parties. It's a 50/50 on whether you survive. It depends on who you piss off first: if you piss off Ireland then you may have a few days of preparation as they have to get through Britain to get to the USA. If you piss off the USA first then you're kind of screwed. Your best chance is to piss off Britain and then run into Ireland. While you're there, plant as much cheap British knockoff whiskey and fake Ireland tea as you can into both respective countries. While they are fighting each other, you can focus on the USA and Venezuela. We in the former may be easier to convince, may God help you with Venezuela, they will eat you alive.

So the order to survive is Ireland, Britain to put them against each other then go into the USA and pray you can convince Venezuela that it was all a joke. You cannot wish to make this go away nor can you wish for anything that would count as a loophole including a total reset or wishing for all parties to stop fighting. You can wish for more ammo because you just started World War 3 and you're going to need that minigun and that ammo and that bunker that just popped up. Silver lining?

1jr4x1m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diamyd_medical_AB/comments/1jr4x1m/20_customs_duty/,20% customs duty," Then we got another piece of the puzzle from a slightly unexpected place.

DMYD which has kept partners in almost all forms on the stretching bench (diabetics' interest organization has concluded 1 agreement and recently increased (50 + 17.5 million SEK).







How should DMYD proceed?

20% additional fees to the primary market USA. Clearly, with an estimated treatment fee of 2 million SEK will be slightly changed in GAD-65 manufacturing.

I see 2 main options.

1/ Completion takes place in the most economically advantageous location. That is GAD-65 is still manufactured in Ume√• and diluted to a dose of 4 ¬µg (mcg) in US. The question is whether undiluted GAD-65 can be sold to the US for a token (low) amount.







2/ The production of GAD-65 is moved to the USA and Ume√• manufactures for the rest of the market. Many put the coffee down their throats when DMYD straightened out the question marks about the manufacturing time and the number of doses per batch.







If DMYD enters into partnership for the USA, it means that the partner in option 2 gets the manufacturing right for GAD-65 which makes the deal more attractive and the deal sum to us shareholders higher (at the expense of lower future profits but the upfront we get at the moment is what the market values. Those who intend to sell on the news care less about what future shareholders get for annual dividends).







How the funds think, I leave at the moment to others to reason about. Sees that some reason that they have to secure not only more subscription rights but also to secure oversubscription of units to secure the free TO5.







Have looked a bit at how TO5 can be valued and I see the various models only applicable to businesses with regular earnings. Pointing to the historical values ‚Äã‚Äãof TO3 and especially TO4 (which TO5 replaces) makes as much sense as saying what the weather will be like in midsummer 2025. Rain or sun.

At each moment, the market correctly priced both TO3 and TO4.

I purchased a Bianca V3 at the end of 2024, but my coffee is usually not very hot (I'd describe as barely hotter than room temperature).

  
A few things I have tried:

\- Cups are seating on the machine at all times

\- Portafilter is always left in the machine (w/ basket)

\- At times, I use the hot water to warm up the cup even further, which works the best. It does seem wasteful and time consuming.

\- Pull 3-4 seconds of water before putting in the portafilter to remove any cold water (not sure if that helps).

  
I am using 200F water in the espresso boiler for medium roast. I tried increasing the temperature in the boiler by a few degrees but that didn't help.

  
Any idea how I can improve my coffee temperature? Is there a way to check that the water coming out of the espresso grouphead is hot enough, and is it worth checking please?",2,1743746142.0,Lelit,0,1.0,False

The day after my dad passed away, I was having a coffee in town. A magpie flew by and sat on the lowest branch of a tree next to me - it was barely four feet away from me. They're usually not very friendly and seldom sit that close to you.

It kept on staring at me as tears rolled down uncontrollably. I took a bit of biscuit and before I even had a chance to think, it flew down any sat by my feet in anticipation.  It was as if it knew me and felt safe in my close proximity.

All the while I was breaking the biscuit for the bird, it looked at me while pecking at the pieces of biscuit on the ground. 

I thought to myself, surely this is no ordinary encounter. I took it as a good omen; I
 told myself, it's dad - he's on his way up! 

It's been real hard dealing with losing him. Tomorrow will be three weeks. Moments ago, a magpie flew in and sat right by my window ledge. This has never happened before. It kept jumping to the ledge, then jumping to the fence, and then back on the ledge again - like 15 times - all the while staring at me. I took a few photos that's the end. 

I'm convinced, my father is visiting me from the other side, reassuring me that everything is as it should be. This kept on happening until I told myself, ""I know dad, I know you're looking after me, and I love you for it - fine, I'll stop crying, now that I know you're well"".

At that very moment, the bird turned and looked straight at me while flapping its wings by the ledge, looked back at me once more, as if to acknowledge my comments, then it flew away. 

It is a little easier now, thank you, dad. 

I love and miss you üíåüíïüíïüíå",4,1743745249.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False

I feel like the labor I'm putting into keeping the house clean isn't being recognized. I need to find a way to address it without being detrimental to our relationship.

**Longer context/Minor venting:**   
As SAHP I take care of our 7mo as well as the house. I also teach two college and community classes in the evening and have a freelance project I work on weekly. My partner is also busy with a demanding job teaching middle school, and takes extra continuing ed college courses and pays our bills, too. They are a loving and caring parent at all times.

The thing is, my partner doesn't seem to notice how much of a mess they make. Recently, after cleaning the whole day, (which as we know goes slowly with LO) bringing the house back together after a long weekend away, my partner came home and after dinner, while on the couch, let the kiddo grab a chocolate chip cookie from their hands. Not really eating it, but just mashing chocolate everywhere. Now I get it--babies are messy! It's part of the deal! It was just demoralizing to watch it happen after all the work put in.   
  
I took a break from the situation and came back to see pureed carrots out (along with the accompanying components that went into steaming and blending strewn across the counter) and the mess expanded. Again, none of this would necessarily be a problem, except that my partner is not the one that cleans up after all of this. I told myself I would optimistically let it play out but two days later, the mess is all still there. 

I get that mornings and evenings are hard and busy, but after a day of wiping off old coffee stains from the counter, scraping dried honey off the floor, etc. it just kind of got to me. I can't say if this is how it's always been and I just had more bandwidth to deal with it back when, or if we've just naturally grown together in this way.   
  
**Proposal:**   
I am going to continue taking care of all the messes the baby and I create together--still going to wash bottles, take care of my dishes, clean any spills I make, empty dishwasher etc. I'm also still going to do the community dishes that come from making dinner. Do all the laundry. Vacuum the floor. But I'm no longer going to clean up my partner's crumbs/spills off the counter, take care of the lunch and breakfast dishes they leave out, pick up their clothes and put them in the hamper, clear tables of their stuff, etc.   
*I want it to be clear to my partner that we're still a team* and I will help out on things if they're feeling overwhelmed, and as requested, but I guess I just want this work to be seen and not unquestioned. And I think also, *if it doesn't bother them, then I need to figure out a way to make it not bother me.* (So far what I've come up with is setting up my office so that I have a clean space to sequester myself in when the clutter becomes too much.)

Thoughts? Am I being unfair/overreacting? Advice on this situation, amending the proposal, or on presenting it? Appreciate everyone's care and attention.",4,1743745166.0,beyondthebump,0,1.0,False

1jr4iqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/VancouverJobs/comments/1jr4iqg/career_advice_encouragement_needed_ubc_graduate/,Career Advice & Encouragement Needed - UBC Graduate,"Hi everyone!

It's been such a tough time and I would really love some advice and positive encouragement right now. This honestly might be more of a vent than anything, but I really don't know where else to turn.

  
To begin, I am a somewhat recent UBC grad, having received my Bachelors of Science in Data Science & Environmental Science (Integrated Sciences) in May of 2024. I've worked extremely hard throughout my degree, placing on the Dean's List for several years in a row and graduating with Distinction (straight-A average) during my time as a student. I also made sure to gain as much work experience as possible, having landed co-op positions in both tech and the federal government, and then spent the last year of my degree working in a paid position at a research lab. On the side, I was also working as an elementary school tutor and even an administrative assistant at one point. Even more on the side, I also continued to be an avid volunteer, from helping to organize a hackathon to being a student club executive to running after school programs for kids to being on the board of directors for a well-known non-profit. 

Throughout all of this, I made sure to be a sociable person and also made time for friends, family, and travelling to be a well-rounded person.

I poured so much of my heart and time and energy into everything I did and stretched myself so thin because I truly believed that if I worked hard, I'd be able to be successful and land a successful career. I feel so bitter and heartbroken that after 8 months of job searching, I haven't been able to land anything- not even entry-level retail positions. I really tried to do everything right- I wrote custom cover letters for every single posting, got feedback from tons of professionals on how to improve my resume/cover letter formatting, I went to networking events, I cold-emailed/messaged people and went on dozens of endless coffee chats, and applied to everything even remotely similar to my past experiences (about 100 jobs total so far). None of it went anywhere.

I originally was hoping to go into the tech industry, but I wasn't expecting it to crash so hard. None of my old co-ops or research lab are able to take me back due to funding issues. Research feels like a dead-end, and I've been warned by many people how difficult it is to land a stable research position. I applied to government jobs and got rejected from all of them for lack of experience, despite my previous experience. I feel like all of my hard work and efforts were for nothing, and I feel so guilty and ashamed for letting down my parents and family- I really wanted to make them proud. They've been nothing but supportive, which makes me feel even more guilty that I can't do better. I recognize how lucky and privileged I am to even have family support during this economy.

 I ended up developing pretty severe depression and am now also in therapy to try to work through it. It's hard to stay positive or believe things will get better when it's been so long and I feel so worthless. When nothing I do matters. But even then I'm still trying to fight and hold on and not give up.

  
Which leads me to today. I've had enough of this heartache and want to go for specific training that will lead to me to a protected, board-certified, in-demand job that is recession-proof no matter what. I also would prefer to work in a career that doesn't require much driving or travelling (ideally I just want to commute to a single location, office, hospital, etc.). I am confident that I have the grades and academic prowess needed for whatever program it is- the question is determining which one, and then determining the volunteer experience I need to boost my application. I can't decide what to do.

At BCIT, I've been looking into the Radiation Therapy program, which I meet all of the requirements for. I've been told that anything healthcare related is in demand right now and it seems like it might be a good fit- science-based, and I get to make a difference in people's lives. I'm only really scared about the fact that any mistake may be the difference in life or death; I'm terrified of accidentally inputting the wrong measurement or doing a slight misalignment of the machine during treatment or making some sort of mistake and then putting a patient's life in even more danger.

I've also been looking into the Master's in Urban Planning. This does feel like the dream career as it ties together so many of my passions (policy work, research work, GIS work, get to serve the public, etc.), and is a regulated profession and office-based with just occasional site visits needed. Despite this being what I'm personally leaning towards, I'm not confident in the job market for urban planners (I don't want to be in another tech situation again, where initially jobs seemed plentiful and then dried up), and I don't have any urban planning experience, nor have any idea how to go about getting it- I keep getting rejected from City  jobs too. It's also an insanely competitive program, and I'm terrified of my chances.

If anyone in this community has any advice or input on the programs I mentioned or where to go from here, I would appreciate it so, so much!! Or any advice and encouragement in general- I'm also open to other program suggestions that you think might be worth looking into. I'm also willing to move across the country. 

I know this is a super long post, and I really do apologize for it and thank you if you took the time to read it to the end. Thank you and wishing you all well!",3,1743744855.0,VancouverJobs,0,1.0,False

1jr4eca,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wellbutrin_Bupropion/comments/1jr4eca/wellbutrin_qa_my_experiences_on_it_during_the/,Wellbutrin Q&A / My experiences on it during the last nine years...,"I (41/M) have been on wellbutrin over the course of the last nine years and I wanted to offer a little bit of insight as to what it's been like.. Firstly, I wanted to say that for me, wellbutrin has been a game changer in life and a personality change - for the better - in a pill. Sure, there's been a few ups and downs along the way, but it has been worth it..

That being said, let me answer a few common questions about it::

1: Does Wellbutrin negatively affect sex drive like SSRI's (Zoloft, prozac, lexapro, etc..)? No. As a matter of fact, wellbutrin increases sex drive. HOWEVER, men may experience mild erectile dysfunction for the first ten to twelve days they take it. This IS temporary and does go away. I personally experienced erectile dysfunction during the first 10-12 days, but after that, my sex drive and ability came back stronger and is still strong to this very day. I have zero issues when it comes to having sex with a woman.

2: Does wellbutrin SR thin your hair? No. I've been on various brands of WB over the last nine years and have had no issues with my hair falling out at all. I do have some graying of my hair, but that's about it. Not sure if the WB is responsible for that tho..

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

3: What are some brands you've tried and what has been the outcome? I have tried::

3A: Sun Pharmaceuticals brand - first brand of WB I was ever on.. It was good, BUT it started randomly making me dizzy here or there, so I had to switch to a different brand to avoid the dizziness side effect.

3B: Teva (second brand I ever used) - good brand overall, would definitely use again. No complaints, no side effects.

3C: ScieGen - Currently on it and really like it! I would recommend this particular generic to anybody who's either new to WB or otherwise. ScieGen CAN come off as strong at first, but your body will get used to it. Also, ScieGen has a pretty sweet ""honeymoon phase"" when you first start it, which is really nice. It makes life feel so much better and it makes inside your head really quiet.. Love it! NOTE: ScieGen brand is also known as ""Dr. Reddy's brand"".

3D: Slate Run / Epic Pharmaceuticals - AVOID at all costs. Will NEVER take either of those brands again no matter what. Epic and Slate run are one and the same, and they are made in China at the lowest common denominator.. The slate run / epic pharma pills themselves literally smell like a fart right out of the bottle, which indicates they're already breaking down before you even get to use them.

3E: Solco - another brand I will never use again. Made me want to ""unalive"" myself on at least one occasion while I was doing some tree work.. Would never use it again for any reason.

3F: Camber - another crap brand.. made me think of all the bad things that the Teva brand of wellbutrin I've used had previously blocked out.

3G: Mylan brand Wellbutrin SR - Did not work for me. Made me think a lot of really bad stuff that the Teva brand had blocked out. Would likely not try that brand again.

3H: Watson brand - Decent brand overall, but felt WAY too strong for me. Had to stop it and go back to Teva brand.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

4: What is your dose? I currently am on 3x ScieGen brand Wellbutrin SR 100's a day. I was previously on two 150MG Wellbutrin SR a day, but to get away from crap brands, I switched down to the 100MG pills three times a day.  NOTE: I feel like the 100MG wellbutrin pills taken three times a day seem to work better for me than the 2x 150MG pills I was taking daily.. I think the dose I'm on gives me more ""coverage"" during the day and I have a constant dose in my system and that really helps things quite a bit.

5: Can I mix an SSRI (Zoloft, Lexapro, prozac, etc..) with wellbutrin ? Yes, you can. I have personally done it but I didn't care for the SSRI (zoloft) I was on, so I ditched it. The zoloft got to where it wasn't really helping much, and it was causing some sexual dysfunction, so I stopped it cold after eight months last year. (NOTE: You may still have sexual dysfunction from the SSRI if you mix it with wellbutrin  -UNLESS - your SSRI dose is small. By ""small"", I mean half a 25MG zoloft (or 12.5MG) a day kind of small.. The smaller the better.)

6: Can I drink alcohol or smoke / vape while on wellbutrin? I personally don't drink, smoke, chew, or vape, but from what I understand, you MUST be okay with not drinking while on WB. Too, the active ingredient (bupropion) in wellbutrin is known to help people stop using nicotine (i.e. stop chewing, smoking, or vaping) altogether. SO if you get on wellbutrin and you currently smoke, chew, or vape, you may end up quitting with your nicotine habit.

7: Have I tried the Lupin brand? No... Would probably try it if my local pharmacy had it in stock or what not..

8: HOW can I get a brand I want such as ScieGen - my pharmacy won't order it? It's simple. All you have to do if your pharmacy won't order a good brand is change pharmacies. I was once with a pharmacy that told me ""We get what we get, and we can't order a special brand for you"" - so I changed pharmacies as SOON as the Camber brand I was on really turned to crap.. Best move I've made in a while in terms of helping fix my mental health!

9: Is SR or XL better? I'm siding with SR, as that's what I've been on for the last 9 years. I have heard however that the XL ""flavor"" of wellbutrin can carry more side effects than SR..

10: How does wellbutrin make you feel? Can you drive or do dangerous things while on it? For me, it makes me clear headed and it makes me not think of a lot of the bad things that have happened in my life which led to me getting on wellbutrin in the first place. It doesn't impair my judgement or ability to drive or do dangerous things (i.e. going jet skiing) in the least. I have driven literally hundreds of miles on wellbutrin and have had zero issues.

11: what other medications pair well with wellbutrin? Given that I personally have a back injury and a chronic headache problem, I have to say that wellbutrin pairs well with Robaxin 750MG (muscle relaxer) and it also pairs well with Fioricet (headache medication). It also pairs well with your typical cough and cold medication (incase you get sick) SO LONG as you take only the recommended dose on the package and do not exceed that dose.

12: What prompted you to get on wellbutrin in the first place? My doctor thought that since I was having tension type headaches (from bad things I've been thru) that wellbutrin would help calm me down on the inside and help me to have fewer headaches.. Admittedly, wellbutrin did NOT help slow or stop my tension headaches, but it did very much change my personality for the better and my family and friends like this new version of me way more than they ever liked the Pre-wellbutrin version of me.

13: Would you recommend wellbutrin to anyone? YES. But I would advise them to avoid the bad brands such as Camber, Solco, Slate run / Epic Pharmaceuticals.

14: Why do I feel so moody / irritable on wellbutrin? Try having your doctor lower your dose. The anger and irritability side effect is dose related, and a smaller dose will produce less (or no) irritability. For instance, I can stand 300MG a day, but at 450MG a day (yes, I've taken that), I want to punch a hole thru a wall.

15: Why do I feel like I've had way too much caffeine when I first start wellbutrin - or when I first start the ScieGen brand of wellbutrin? If you're starting out with the 150MG pills, they can come off as strong. But if you go down to the 100MG pills, they are less strong and won't feel like you've had too much caffeine.

16: Can I have coffee, soda pop, energy drinks on wellbutrin? With soda pop, you're good to go, but with coffee or energy drinks, I recommend using those in moderation and SLOWLY. Don't chug a whole energy drink or high caffeine coffee in one sitting, but space out your drinks over time. Consume no more than roughly 60 to 80MG of caffeine a day. Any more than 80 or so MG of caffeine a day will make you IRRITABLE in the realest way.

17: Can I consume marijuana or edibles while on wellbutrin? I do not recommend it, no.

18: Isn't there a seizure risk with wellbutrin? Not really, UNLESS you've ever been diagnosed with some form of epilepsy. The chances of you having a seizure at 100, 200, or even 300MG a day are negligible especially if you're on the Wellbutrin SR or XL ""flavors"". Now, if you were to take some crazy dose above 450MG per day, you may run into the seizure side effect, but other than that? The odds of having a seizure are really small (less than 1 percent) unless you are predisposed to epilepsy.. (NOTE: If you're predisposed to epilepsy or if you've ever had a seizure, your doctor likely won't write you wellbutrin in the first place)

19: Would I recommend someone taking 450MG/day or more? NO. Me, personally, when my doctor ramped me up to 450MG a day not long after I got on wellbutrin in 2016, I got super irritable and even really fun things I would do in life (like going jet skiing) didn't seem fun at all.. I had to go back down to 300MG/day to avoid the irritability side effect. That being said, 450 will make you irritable more likely than not.

20: Is it hard to step down from say, 450 to 300? Or is it hard to step down from 300 to 200? No. When I went down by a hundred milligrams a day, I didn't really notice any changes and I didn't have withdrawals. The drop down in dosage was seamless and no problem at all.

21: I'm on the SR or XL ""Flavor"" of wellbutrin - can / should I break my pills in half ? Absolutely not. Breaking wellbutrin SR or XL in half will make it ""instant release"" and CAN make you irritable. Do not do it.

I don't have a job so I don't have much money aside from Christmas and birthday money, which is good I guess.

1jr46qk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jr46qk,Turtle Bay Resort,"We‚Äôve been back for almost a week now and wanted to share how our trip went in case anyone is interested in Turtle Bay Resort. My husband, 10 year old, 5 month old and I stayed 6 nights. We had plans to stay put at the resort because we just had a baby and wanted to relax and slow down a bit. 

Day 1
- [ ] After landing we hit up target for last minute baby items/snacks
- [ ] The drive to the hotel was about an hour 
- [ ] Check in was super easy and we got an upgrade to a premium ocean view room with a large balcony and two double beds
- [ ] We had rented a Snoo for the trip which was dropped off earlier in the day and the bell desk brought that up for us. Super easy!

Day 2
- [ ] This was a pool day for us. Had no problems finding chairs at 10:30am but finding shade was more challenging. 
- [ ] When we got back to the room they had dropped off Banana bread for us. 
- [ ] Explored the stables and got to brush the horses.
- [ ] Dinner at Alaia‚Ä¶the coconut dessert was to die for. It was basically a mini cake and we saved half to eat on the balcony. 

Day 3
- [ ] Lei making class
- [ ] Hula lesson 
- [ ] My husband had a massage and he loved it 
- [ ] Headed over to the beach right before lunch and spent the rest of the day there 
- [ ] Had no problems getting chairs with shade around noon 
- [ ] Dinner at Giovanni‚Äôs food truck. I‚Äôm a vegetarian so I didn‚Äôt have any but my husband and son loved it. I did have their mac and cheese/garlic rice and it was delicious.

Day 4
- [ ] Ukulele class 
- [ ] I had my massage at the spa. It was quite honestly the worst massage I‚Äôve ever had. The room I was in was a 1 way privacy window and I could see everyone walking by. It was also too bright in there to relax. And I was sore the next two days. Would not recommend. They also add on a 20% service charge and 18% if that goes to the massage therapist and they say ‚Äúgratuity is optional‚Äù 
- [ ] We had a day bed reserved but it was pouring that morning so was kind of disappointed but it cleared up by 10ish and got to enjoy the kids water slide all day long. 
- [ ] Dinner was the Elephant Shack. The wait was at least 45 minutes. Wasn‚Äôt worth it for us. But they were busy so folks must like it. 

Day 5
- [ ] Whale watching tour with North Shore Catamaran Charters. What a great experience! Don was amazing and he even let my 10 year old steer for a bit. We saw 2 sets of humpback whales and I appreciated that we kept somewhat of a distance so we didn‚Äôt disturb them
- [ ] Lunch was Poke at No7 Poke and Roll. They had a vegetarian option which was really good. Seating is limited inside but we were able to find space
- [ ] Shave ice at Matsumoto of course 
- [ ] Family photos with the hotel in the evening. WE LOVE THEM!! Grace was amazing. 
Day 6 
- [ ] My 10 year old did the Jr. Waterman Adventure with Rocky and Dylan. He had so much fun! They took them paddle boarding, rode in the back of a pick up truck, canoeing, and tandem surfing. 
- [ ] Spent the afternoon at Kawela Bay Beach. It was pretty much empty and lots of shade 
- [ ] Dinner at Roy‚Äôs Beach house. There was only 1 vegetarian item for the main course and I didn‚Äôt really care for it but my husband enjoyed his dinner. 

We had breakfast every morning at Alia. The hostess‚Äôs were freaking amazing. They made our trip. Gave them a hug goodbye and they gave my little one a stuffy. The entire staff at the hotel was amazing. There was an older employee who loved on the baby and got him rubber duckies. Everyone was really kind and made our stay enjoyable. However‚Ä¶the bed was too soft. We didn‚Äôt sleep so great üòÇ

[LitRPG + Slice of Life + Modern + Weak to Strong]

‚ÄúSometimes I feel like I‚Äôm in a bad luck loop: wake up, trip on the rug, spill coffee, repeat.‚Äù 

Set on Earth in the modern day (well, Earth-like‚Ä¶ cuz lawyers), this book is a weak-to-strong, litRPG story.

So grab a Grepsi Cola and read about a guy who is literally the world‚Äôs unluckiest person‚Ä¶.


***

‚ÄúWhy am I sooooo unlucky?‚Äù This has been said by a million people, a million times, but in the case of Malick Tychandros, a genuinely unlucky guy, it‚Äôs warranted.

Bad things always happen to him.

Bird flies by? Poop incoming.
Car is running fine. Till it‚Äôs not.
Shoelaces? Untied.

Then one day, he gets a System that turns it all around.

Dun, dun, dun! Dramatic music.

There are no dark mysteries. No global conspiracies with unimaginable consequences. Just a guy, a magic bracelet and a System. Oh. And a lucky blender with hidden potential.



*Rated PG-13 for language
*No harem
*Weak to Strong MC
*Lots of humour

Posts daily

Feeling lucky? Check it out!

Book 1 is written, and Book 2 is in editing.
Guaranteed (already plotted out) will be completed, no indefinite hiatus‚Ä¶. Unless something unlucky happens to author.

Hey MaximizeMe fam! üòä I‚Äôve got a little secret to share that might just make you feel like a time wizard. Ever feel like you‚Äôre caught in a never-ending game of Calendar Tetris? You know, when you‚Äôre plugging meetings and tasks into every available minute, hoping not to drop the ball on either work or life? üé≤üôÉ

Let‚Äôs rewind a bit. A few months back, I found myself constantly juggling tasks, cramming more into my schedule than seemed humanly possible. I was seriously considering applying for honorary octopus status. üêô But then, one fine coffee-fueled morning, I stumbled across the concept of **time blocking**... and my life took an unexpected and refreshing twist.

**Here‚Äôs the lightbulb momentüí° for me:**

- **Not all hours are created equal:** I realized that I‚Äôm not a non-stop productivity machine (newsflash, right?). My energy peaks and troughs like everyone else's. So why try to jam high-focus tasks into my post-lunch slump? üåØüò¥

- **Organize by energy, not just time:** Instead of shoving tasks wherever they fit on my calendar, I started scheduling based on my mental energy. High-focus work went into my peak hours (morning, obviously), and routine tasks settled into those groggy afternoon-time slots.

- **Block it out, but make it flexible:** I started blocking out chunks for specific tasks, but left wiggle room for the unexpected. It‚Äôs like drawing with erasable markers‚Äîstructured yet adaptable. After all, who wants a rigid calendar dictating their life?

- **The great **procrastisweep**:** Instead of aimlessly hopping from task to task, I concentrated effort on one thing at a time. That 10-minute task took 10 minutes, not an hour of scattered focus!

Here‚Äôs where the magic happened: By respecting my natural energy cycle, I *gained* about 10 hours a week that previously just evaporated. üïí‚ú® Yup, that‚Äôs a whole week‚Äôs worth of TV binging, passion project pursuing, or simply sitting in blissful idleness!

Of course, I still play a little Calendar Tetris (hey, life‚Äôs unpredictable!), but now I feel like I‚Äôm the one holding the controller. üéÆ So, what do you think, friends? How do you balance energy and tasks in your daily hustle? Ever tried time blocking? 

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and wild scheduling stories. Let‚Äôs keep maximizing, one block at a time! üöÄ",1,1743743120.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

Lekin nind khul hi jaa rahi thi.. kyuki vrat lene ki soch rakhi hai.. pet Khali hai.. mai 3 bje phir 4 bje then 5 bje utta.. Then, I thought ki utt hi jaate hai.. bed banaya.. aur kabde pehne kr niche gya.. pucho gate pr hi so gya... Aaj pucho ke baal bohot jhad rahe hai.. to usko apne sath nahi Sula sakta... 

Mujhe dekhte hi pucho ke muh pr smile aa gyi.. M bhi khush ho gya... Use dekh kr. Then, downstairs gya.. Mummy se pehle utt gya tha.. üòÅ. Pehle jaakr mummy ke pair chukr aashirwad liya... Then, sirf paani pi kr .. m morning walk pr chala gya.. Aaj ki subha same hi thi... Kuch alag nahi.. pyara mausam üå∏. I completed both the mandir Wale points as discussed in the previous post.

M park pauch.. abhi tak bhuk nahi lag rahi thi... Aaj Mayank nahi aaya tha.. Usne kaha usse kuch kaam hai. I completed my 9000 steps... Bs ghar ki taraf chal diya.. Aaj vrat lene ka socha tha to nahane se pehle kuch nahin kha pi sakte. So, I skipped my daily mausami juice ü•§. Ghar pauch kr bola ki aaj gungune panni se nahana hai. Jab tak paani garam ho rah tha.. Mai pucho ke sath terrace pr gya..

Phulo ko panni diya.. pucho ko paani m khelna pasand hai lekin nahana nahi.. aisa kyu kise pta.. shaayad pucho hi jaane.paani dene ke baad m thoda pucho ke sath baitha aur kl ki journaling Krna lga. Uske baad m aur pucho niche aagye. 

Nahane ke baad.. puja kari bohot samay baad.. Aur arti ke baad wahi.. uske liye bhi prayer krli..ü§£ü§£ü§£. Phir wahi apne skin routine... Phir tika lagaya.. pure ghar m dhup lgai..

Then. 3 kele kha liye.. bhai kele khane ke baad jo bhook lagi... Matlab.. vrat rakhna bohot hard hota hai... 
Things I ate with timestamp:
1. 3 kele - 8 am
2. Ek aur kela - 8:30 am
3. 1 ltr paani - 9 am
4. Cashews aur raisins - 10 am
5. Vrat chips - jyada namkin the - 10:30 am
6. Grapes - 11:30 am
7. Apple and papaya - 1 pm

Then.. mujhe nind aa rahi thi... Me and my Mom were watching golmaal old clips.. meri sofa m aakh lag gyi.. thodi deer baad mummy ne utaya then.. m jaakar bed pr so gya..  Shaam ko office ke liye time pr ut gya.. fresh hua.. I wore loose fit blue  jeans üëñ, blue and white lined full shirt, white tees.. and, paired it with white sneakers.

Office jaane se pehle mummy ne bola tha ki juice pi liyo... To phir kya... 50 rupee ka badaa ghilas Mousami ka... Ye pikar m office ke liye nikal gya...
On the way... I guess some sort of puja thi as bohot saare log Nadhi kinare baithe the.. Choti Chaat puja.. 

M metro paucha... 2 baar card recharge Krna ka try Kiya.. ho hi nahi raha tha... Phir maine mobile qr se entry kri.. Metro khali mil gyi to Mai bhait gya.. Aur Vivid dream part 2 nikhne laga... Pta hi nahi chala ki Rajiv Chowk aagya.. I just got up, and bag pakad kr jaldi gya.. Time pr metro se utar gya... 

My current playlist:
1. Dil to Jaan tu
2. Her x next to you x this is how forever feels like
3. Finding her
4. Line without a hook
5. Sapta Sagaradaache Ello title track - instrumental 

Aur phir.. wahi Rajiv Chowk se Blue line... To Electronic City Metro pakdi... I usually have my earphones on taki m busy raho.. I usually scroll pinterest, however abhi kuch 1-2 hafto se reel ka thoda addiction ho gya hai.. Although likhne m thoda busy rakhta hu khudko.

To Mai Metro se nikal.. rikshaw kri aur office pauch gya.. M hamesha office pauch kr Maa, ya badi bahen ko call krdeta hu.. aur us bahane ye bhi puch leta hu ki khana khaya ki nahi...

I was in a good mood.. ki aaj wo dikhegi... Aur mai janta tha ki Aakshit (pookie) nahi aayega.. Vo hota hai to aacha lagta hai.. Source of happiness hai bhai mera.. To vrat tha to coffee skip krke mai locker room se direct floor pr chala gya.. I was 15 minutes early... To sab logo se handshake ü§ù aur hugs ü§ó exchange kre... Sb log mujhe dekh kr khush the.. 

After sometime mujhe Hritikesh (team member) ne bataya ki Shivam (team member) ka B'day hai.. I mean usne kaha ki 4/4 ko hai.. Vaise kaam jyada tha nahi to... Maine koi break nahi liya.. So, jb 12 bje to m break lga kr cafeteria gya.. I bought a dairy milk chocolate for him, Jaldi upar aaya.. thoda wait kr, and usko chocolate dekar Happy Birthday bola!  Guess what uska birthday nahi tha.. Bhai usne mujhe gale laga liya.. bola bhai kisi ne kabhi chocolate üç´ nahi di.. bhai M emotional ho gya.. Maine kaha koi na bhai, ab maine dedi na..

Usne mujhe offer kri.. lekin as vrat tha to kuch nahi kha sakta tha...aur waise bhi mujhe mitha mna hai... Due to skin allergy... ‚ò†Ô∏è

I was desperately waiting for her.. mujhe pta tha ki wo aaegi.. I mean... I asked one of her team members ki vo kaha hai, I know thoda unusual hai.. but.. koi na.. usne kaha koi idea nahi hai.. phir kuch deer baad, wahi sandal ki, "" tap tap"".. I know wahi hai.. My heart was pounding very fast. I was blushing üôà üôà.. I got her text on teams as she was on half leave due to her health. I went to her desk.. we shoke hands ü§ù and asked about her health usne kaha thodi weakness hai.. I mean usse jab bhi dekhta hu mood automatically thik ho jaata hai.. chahe kitne hi laga ho..

Then, Mai dinner Krne chala gya.. akele as aaj akele khane ka Mann ho Raha tha.. dinner m parathe, salad aur lauki chanaa üòãüòãüòãüòã bohot tasty tha.. then, dinner finish krne ke baad m upar floor pr pauch.. bhai nind se aa rahi thi.. 

Then, I around 5 am, I asked ki, ek chai ho jae?...She said yes... I said, really? It's okay agar koi issue to nahi.. she said, hm. To we, and uska colleagues chai pine ... Office building ke bahar gye.. we had tea.. thodi baat hui.. She said ab uska peer thik hai.. as she got bruises on her foot.  Why the fuck... I ask these type of silly questions üò≠üò≠üò≠. She said.. ushe kuch dino se nind nahi aa rahi thik se.. I said, maybe mental stress.. well my response was ignored... Koi na... Her colleague, and she were into some sort of conversation about perfume, and alcohol.. mujhe koi idea nahi tha to mai sunta raha aur bhutt ki tarah khada raha.... Then, I realised, I am being the third wheel... to maine kaha ki mai chala... I guess usko laga ki m bore ho Raha hu.. usne rokhna chaha.. but... mujhe khud ko aacha nahi lag raha tha to mai wapas chala aaya.

Then, I met Harshit ( team member but bhai jaisa), and kovida (team member but badhi behen jaisi.. )... Usne rokha aur kaha billu kya hua..? Usne mera naam ""Billu"" rakha hai.. I love it. I said kuch nahi.. Depressed kyu hai? Sab thik hai? Tu thik nahi lag raha... I said m thik hu.. fast ki wajah se weakness lga rahi hai chahre pr, "" Usne kaha ye sab kisi aur ko diyo bahane"". I said, sab thik hai.. don't worry yrr. Unko bye bola.. straight to the floor.

That's it for today.. stay tuned for more!!!

Can‚Äôt figure out the trigger for the life of me","I‚Äôve been diagnosed with IH for about 3 years now. I‚Äôve tried various meds (Sunosi, Modafinil, Adderall and Wakix) and nowadays alternate between a few months of Wakix and a few months of Modafinil because I build up tolerance very quick. 

I‚Äôm currently on 25 mg of Wakix/daily. I was feeling okay on it last year, but the past 4 months my symptoms seem really high again and I can‚Äôt figure out why.

When things were good last year, was at 1 nap a day and about 3 cups of coffee (plus Wakix), and had energy to go exercise about 3-4 times a week which felt amazing. I felt  mentally a lot clearer, started to do creative projects again etc. I felt like I finally had my life back again after decades of being in a sleepy fog.

Then around December I noticed things slowly got worse. Initially I thought it was building up tolerance again, so I switched to Modafinil but no change. I‚Äôm now back at 5-6 cups of coffee, 2-3 naps a day and 1-2 energy drinks a day just to make it through the day and still feel like a zombie. It takes so much effort to get out of bed, and feel like a shell of myself because it takes everything I have in me to get through work (FT job), not snapping at my kids, making dinner, etc. 

I don‚Äôt feel depressed, only depressed about the fact that I‚Äôm so tired and feel frustrated and sad that I‚Äôm missing out on so much that life has to offer because I‚Äôm either too tired or I‚Äôm sleeping lol.

I can‚Äôt figure out what changed. Diet the same, work the same, no new stressors, etc. Bloodwork shows no change. Does anybody else have this?? I so wish I could understand why this is happening because even if I can‚Äôt change it, I at least understand it and know that it will eventually get better again 

NB: I can‚Äôt go up in meds, I‚Äôm already at the max for Wakix and Modafinil ",1,1743742701.0,idiopathichypersomnia,1,1.0,False

It slithers out from the corner of dusty shelves like a gaseous demon that has long since forgotten its purpose. It's not the usual scent a toilet has of flowers and fruits, no, this one hits you like an industrial accident colliding with a rotten fruit stand in a forgotten corner of the earth.

At first, it's subtle‚Äîjust a faint, acrid hint that seems to rise up from the floor tiles. But then it intensifies, and you realize it‚Äôs crawling up your nostrils, worming its way into your sinuses like some malicious vapor that lives only to torment. Is it plastic? Is it a forgotten sandwich? Is it the essence of spilled coffee that‚Äôs somehow soaked into the very bones of the building for decades? No one knows, but the stench is now inescapable.

It's as if the smell was created by some unholy science experiment gone wrong, the kind of thing that could only be birthed in a university‚Äôs deepest, forgotten labs. You try to breathe normally, but every inhalation is like a personal betrayal, each gulp of air sending a ripple of nausea through your body. Your brain feels fried, reeling with the sheer potency of it all‚Äîthe smell has entered your soul.

The smell gets stronger the closer you get to that corner‚Äîevery step, every awkward turn between the urinals, feels like you're stepping into a darker, weirder dimension where smells have physical form. People pass by with wide eyes and pinched noses, but no one speaks of it out loud, as if acknowledging it would somehow make it worse.

Is it science? Is it an experiment gone too far? Is it something worse‚Äîa mark of a library toilet cursed by the forgotten? You don‚Äôt know, but you‚Äôve been trapped here, and the smell is never leaving you.

1jr3piq,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1jr3piq/been_rejected_for_over_8_years/,Been rejected for over 8 years,"Got cheated on my first relationship back when I was 19. Apart from that she always use to play games to test me which fucked up my mental health during the relationship. I‚Äôve been trying ever since but I am always very cautious about it amounted the mountain of trust issues, but I keep getting rejected and friend zoned. 

TLDR I am 27 now, and also recently got rejected by a colleague, which was harsh and gave me panic attack for work misbehaviour allegations. Just to give context here is what happened.

I never looked at her in that way but were very good colleagues inside work. Lately since last year we were actively talking with each other on social media as well, but it was all friendly. We share the same level dark humour and brainrot memes. All friendly. This year I dont know what happened. I would catch her looking at me in pantry and when I look back she would look away immediately and smirk in a shy way. She is supper introverted, just like me. But I didn‚Äôt think much of it, as I myself was not looking for anything. Suddenly out of know where she tried to make some plans with me specifically after office over the weekend, which I refused with an excuse got some work over the weekend. She would again raise that when we were chatting and exchanging reels the other day, i said I can go. But I never followed up on it, as I was also not interested that much. Then we had an offsite where we would talk, and she randomly takes the conversations to deep personal level which involves her family and for some reason it also went to her anxiety about dating, and also share yes I have the same anxiety. And yes something was not right, I know I was over reading, maybe I suddenly might have developed an interest. After that I decided let‚Äôs give it try reinitiate the weekend plan she pitched before, but for some other reasons we agreed it was not possible during that day, so she offered to cook some food and send over instead. I found that so sweet, no one has ever done that to me in my life üò≠ so I mildly suggest that i could come over since we lived reasonably close by, but then I side tracked and said that might not be possible because I have some work and not sure whether I can make it. She said it would be better if I can come over. I said I‚Äôll confirm. So after 6 hours I confirmed. I was terrible confused what going on here. Am I misleading her? So I consulted a friend about the entire situation, the key thing she said a women trusts me enough that she invited me over dinner and it might be a good sign, but don‚Äôt go in with expectations. So I go over with no expectations, the moment u arrived she starts pestering me with food wtf üò≠ why tf is she so sweet to me, I said you don‚Äôt want me to eat alone so she accompanied. We were talking and talking, her being her introverted self and shy, somehow ended up in conversation, where I told her she sings great (she was singing every now and then), to which I made a joke to not make the complement sound weird of too rushed ‚ÄúI used to sing as well, but that only due to my break up üò≠‚Äù, too which she pressed and asked when was the last breakup, after I answered she started talking about her last breakup which causes her anxiety to date. Rest of the night went well, I tried leaving earlier but she insisted on staying a bit, then I fucked off. 

The next day, I was so anxious, I consulted my friend again, she suggested I should get to obviously no her more, because even I had the anxiety of dating that force myself not indulge further. I decided that was it, let her advance further if needed. But my friend said I should probably invite her over coffee after office sometime. So I texted her ‚Äúhey yesterday was fun! There is a new cafe that opened near office would like to go and check it out once, would you be interested to join over coffee?‚Äù To which she replied are you asking casually or are you asking me over a date? I got a bit nervous as this was not loooking good. So I gave a bit diplomatic response ‚Äúdon‚Äôt get me wrong, really like talking yesterday and that‚Äôs why wanted to hangout after coffee‚Äù, to which she gave a really formal response, she said thanks for letting her know, and she really appreciates the invite, but she does not think it‚Äôs appropriate. Holy fuck. What the fuck have i done. To do damage control I replied ‚Äúthanks for letting me know! I hope I didn‚Äôt make you uncomfortable, good night!‚Äù, she just replied ‚Äúnot at all! Goodnight!‚Äù

Ever since then i haven‚Äôt initiated any conversations with her outside work even in social media. At work she seemed normal like before. But I have been on constant anxiety if this escalates to management, or if she talks about this to other colleagues that would have my face loss. I have learned my lesson.  Never shit where you eat. 

It‚Äôs just disheartening that over the last 8 years no one has ever said yes, which has affected my self image. At this point I have decided to live alone and financially be prepared for that as well. Being an introvert with social anxiety is just life on hard mode. It‚Äôs 1000% easier for me to get a new job than find a fucking date and settle down for bare fucking minimum. Yea and depression kicked in again for this weekend. Sorry for the long read.

**AITAH for sterilizing myself against my partner‚Äôs wishes?**



Ok Reddit I need some unbiased outside opinions because I truly feel like I‚Äôm going crazy dealing with this situation. I (28F) and my partner (28M) have 2 children together and have been married for 8 years, for those 8 years I‚Äôve either been on birth control when we were preventing pregnancy or tracking my cycle when we were trying to conceive (adding this just to give the community the context that reproductive responsibility has always fallen on my shoulders).

Recently we discussed the possibility of being done with children since we have our 2 and the family really feels complete, my partner is in agreement that a third child is off the table for him as well. So with that I thought ‚Äúgreat! I can bring up sterilization for either him or I‚Äù, the reason I wanted this is because I‚Äôve had every form of birth control before and none of them ever left me feeling 100% okay so I wanted to be done with birth control completely since we both agreed we‚Äôre done.

It‚Äôs been about 3 months since our talk about more children so I brought up either getting a vasectomy for him or me getting a salpingectomy (removing my fallopian tubes), what I thought would be a productive conversation completely blew up. He outright refused a vasectomy and when I was okay with that and said I‚Äôd happily get a salpingectomy he completely flipped his shit on me, screaming at me about how he forbids it from happening and he won‚Äôt allow me to damage myself like that.

I ended up just leaving the conversation and headed to get our kids from school but on the way I ended up calling my gynecologist to schedule a consultation for the salpingectomy after making sure I won‚Äôt need my spouse‚Äôs approval. So Reddit AITAH if I go through with the sterilization against my partner‚Äôs wishes?

**snazzy\_soul**

*He ‚Äúforbids‚Äù you. Big NOPE on that.*



**frolicndetour**

*Yea and lol at him thinking that procedure will damage her more than childbearing.*



**SuperCulture9114**

*Or the hormonal bs we put into our bodies for dekades.*



**vorpal\_wombat**

NTA: your body, your choice and no man can forbid you from controlling your reproductive destiny.



**Desert-Grimworm**

*Damage yourself? Does he not realize that birth control has serious side effects?*

*I can't help think it's more than the procedures. Even though he said he's done with wanting more kids his actions say otherwise. He's not being honest with you.*

*If you love this man talk to him again. Be firm. Find out what he is really not saying.*

*He is your partner. He should be supporting you in your choice for the procedure. You should not be hiding it.*

*Id say he is the AH...*



**Update - a few hours later**



Due to the support and advice I found on here I managed to get the confidence and level headspace needed to try to have another conversation with my partner. After getting our children to their school/daycare for the day I went to our local coffee shop to pick us up each a cup, I figured it can either be seen as a show of care or a peace offering.

Once I got home he was sitting at our island doom scrolling through TikTok (I think we‚Äôve all been there), I decided standing across from him would be a bit of a better choice so I gave us our respective cups and asked if I could get his attention for a conversation. Well what I hoped would be productive turned unproductive quickly as he sighed with an eye roll and turned off his phone, I started by asking the big question of if he wanted anymore children, I even suggested he doesn‚Äôt think about what I said on the subject and just tell me his feelings about more children; with that he answered a firm no and told me as he said before a third child is and will always be off the table.

I then asked him if he had any fears or concerns about surgeries/medical procedures, he said no to this question as well. So I asked if he understood the procedure and what it entailed and he said yes he does which is why he doesn‚Äôt want me to get it done, in his words I wouldn‚Äôt be a woman if I got any part of my reproductive organs (what makes me a woman) removed and he refuses to allow me down that path. I then followed up by asking about his getting a vasectomy and he said it‚Äôs pretty much the same thing for men and he won‚Äôt let anyone take away if manhood.

The final question I managed to ask was did he just expect me to be on birth control forever and this man looked me in m face and said it‚Äôs worked so well for me already why change things up, guys as I stated in my previous post I am miserable and in debilitating pain with birth control. At the end of this I just grabbed my coffee and went sit on our porch just trying to wrap my head around the conversation while he sit in the house acting like nothing is wrong and we‚Äôre just having a normal day off together‚Ä¶.

**piscesxire**

*He genuinely does not care for you, your health, or your sanity. Chronic pain is not nothing. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre experiencing this, but please make sure you‚Äôre safeguarding your own health before attempting to take his viewpoint. This is why people need to understand that ‚Äúgender identity‚Äù isn‚Äôt a scary topic laced with hatred. People just want to keep pushing the gender roles our grandparents had. This man genuinely thinks that him getting a vasectomy makes him less of a man and that his wife shouldn‚Äôt have a QOL procedure. I could see a sliver of a possibility of him having a point if both of yall wanted kids, but yall don‚Äôt.*

*NTA, and definitely recommend getting the procedure anyways. You shouldn‚Äôt be suffering on pills and hormones for him to be comfortable in your own skin.*



**Steampunkboy171**

*As a guy. I can't comprehend doing anything that would bring my partner pain or could lead to her dying quicker or first. It makes me so sad and miserable to know that so many other men cause this and are just okay with it. Or not even aware of the pain and suffering they're causing.*

*I'm not even married to my partner yet. But I love her and would do whatever is necessary to make sure that she can live the happiest and healthiest life possible. It makes me so infuriated to know that so many other men don't think this way or even consider it. (I mean shit look at how many men treat their partner when they're on a period like a leper. Rather than doing research to understand it and helping in whatever way they can to make there partners as comfortable as they can through it every month.)*

*Hell if I could. I'd gladly take on pain for her. If it meant she didn't need to struggle or suffer through it. Cause at the end of the day her pain in a way is my pain. It's supposed to be a part of being partner or married isn't it? To share each other's struggles and pain. So that neither has to face it alone?*

*So yes fuck this guy. And may he live the rest of his life alone.*



**Update - 2 days later**



Hey Reddit I just wanted to give a small update, I‚Äôve been reading all of your comments on my last two post I swear! I appreciate all the advice and kind words, sometimes even the unkind words because it gives me more to think about.

So to start I‚Äôve been at my sister‚Äôs with the children all weekend, I told my husband that she was feeling lonely and wanted us to stay over, he believed it as we usually try to do this once a month. I called off of work Monday so my sister and I can meet with the divorce lawyer that handled her divorce, I‚Äôm unsure if divorce will be the path I go down but I want to get my ducks in a row before laying it all down for my husband.

Also I would like to answer some questions that I saw a lot of in my last post:

Yes I still plan to go through with the sterilization, I absolutely don‚Äôt want anymore children even if this ends in divorce. I plan to tell him it‚Äôs getting done no matter what he says or believes.

There will definitely be no sex with him anymore, I feel like I lost all attraction and respect for him.

The children don‚Äôt know what going on, they just think it‚Äôs a fun time at auntie‚Äôs house.

Condoms are a no, I exist because of a broken condom üòÇ.

I currently have an IUD and while yes it has been the best birth control I‚Äôve been on I still cannot function properly for a week out of the month due to pain, bleeding, and depressive episodes.

No he hasn‚Äôt done anything like this before which is what caught me so off guard with everything. Disagreements in our relationship have up until now been able to be discussed and compromised on.

We grew up in a deep catholic community but fell away from the church years ago.

**miriam-light**

*Sounds like you‚Äôre handling this like a total boss getting your ducks in a row, making informed choices, and not letting anyone guilt-trip you into something you don‚Äôt want. Love to see it. The ‚Äúno sex‚Äù part and the whole losing attraction/respect? Yeah, that‚Äôs a pretty solid sign this relationship is on life support. Getting a lawyer‚Äôs perspective is definitely the move, even if you‚Äôre not sure about divorce yet. nd the condom comment? Valid. Your reasoning is airtight. Whatever happens next, just know you‚Äôre doing what‚Äôs best for you, and that‚Äôs what matters most.*

>OOP: Thank you for that, I feel like it‚Äôs a total shit show on my end but I‚Äôm trying to keep the blow up to a minimum. I know there‚Äôs a chance shit will hit the fan with him due to how things have been going currently. But I don‚Äôt want drama come from my end.



**Astyryx**

>I plan to tell him it‚Äôs getting done no matter what he says or believes.

*Stop right there. He will clean out your bank accounts. Get this done quietly and quickly. Do not under any circumstances warn this man. Do not dismiss the seriousness of this moment. This is how you get dead.*

>OOP: Thankfully our finances for the most part are separated, the only joint bank account we have is for bills and child expenses



**brainfreez012**

*Serious question. If you abstaining from sex, why get the procedure? If you are abstaining, have you fallen out of love? Is that the reason for the lawyer?*

>OOP: I want the procedure for myself no matter my relationship status, I want to be done with birth control without a chance of children no matter where the future takes me. As well as the fact that this procedure reduces the risk of cervical cancer significantly which it‚Äôs common in my family so that‚Äôs a plus. I haven‚Äôt fallen out of love with him per say but I truly hold no respect for him right now with how he‚Äôs treated me over this, I‚Äôm unsure if we will divorce but I feel like it might be for the best especially if to him this will ‚Äúdamage me‚Äù.

&#x200B;

**Update - 1 month later**

&#x200B;

I know a few people have been messaging me as well as commenting on a few platforms for an update on everything going on.

To start off with the divorce, I‚Äôm finishing up with my lawyer to get the divorce petition written and served to my husband, that should happen before the end of this month. Last I heard from his side with the divorce he got a lawyer for himself and once served wants all communications going through our lawyers. I finished up sorting through our asset divisions and making a custody plan so my lawyer has that ready to be sent over to his lawyer for any questions or concerns about it, I‚Äôm sure there will be a bit of back and forth until an agreement is met.

Next an update about the children. They now know we are separating and going through a divorce, while initially they were very upset with the news things kind of settled and became accepted, they are in therapy individually and us as a family so I‚Äôm hoping that stays helping them. My husband has been having them about one day a week, usually being Saturday during the day as he expresses not being able to handle them alone at night. I keep him in the loop about therapy, even offering him to come if he is willing, which so far has been a no the the few sessions we have had. I also make sure he knows that he is welcomed to have the children more than just a day, I‚Äôm hoping he comes around to coparenting a bit better because I know the kids do miss him. I try to communicate with him on the happening in the kids life such as school and extra curriculums but he keeps pushing me to communicate through his mom, so far I have been sending them both similar messages so there is proof I‚Äôm communicating with him directly as well as his preferred way.

Lastly my surgery. My consultation went amazingly and my surgery is scheduled for the end of June, my mom and sister will be with me through the surgery and healing process, I‚Äôm very thankful for them. My gynecologist did remove mg iud about a week ago and honestly I‚Äôve been feeling so much better and as each day passes I feel like I‚Äôm really coming back to myself, I‚Äôm just waiting for that first period to see if it‚Äôll be like they usually are or if I‚Äôm back to normal. I am getting a full work up though in about 2 weeks, my doc wants my hormones, vitamins, and everything checked as well as doing a few ultrasounds to check everything.

So that‚Äôs really all I have going on, nothing exciting or ground breaking. Just a sad start to a divorce and medical stuff

**redfancydress**

*He‚Äôs mad because you‚Äôre getting sterilized but the moron can‚Äôt handle his kids overnight!?
Here‚Äôs the real deal‚Ä¶ somewhere deep in his mind he thinks that now that you‚Äôre getting sterilized, you‚Äôre gonna be going out all the time having sex and not worrying about pregnancy and that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs gonna saddle you with those kids seven days a week so you never get a chance to date again.
Force him to take his children every weekend or at least every other weekend overnight*


>OOP:
I honestly thought about it because I know the kids deserve time with him but I‚Äôm worried that it‚Äôll just do more harm than good to them. If he can‚Äôt handle them I know his mom is there but I don‚Äôt want him to make it seem like they‚Äôre not worth his time when they‚Äôre already going through so much




flippysquid

Talk to his mom about it and see if she‚Äôll slap some sense into his idiot head. Your poor kids.


>OOP:
It‚Äôs definitely been mentioned, I know she doesn‚Äôt want to rock the boat too much but has offered to have them for some sleepovers once summer starts if they want. I will encourage them to go to spend the time with family

**DMPinhead**

*We're rooting for you and hope you the best.
Given how your husband has been, you might want to consider using a co-parenting app where all communication goes through the app (use the app for all communication -- no more phone calls, txting, emails, etc.). I imagine he can share the app with his mom; that way, both of them get your messages, and you have proof of what was communicated. For example, he can't complain that he wasn't told about something when it's right there in the app.*



>OOP:
I have suggested it because in my last post someone mentioned it, but he refused to download anything. So now I‚Äôm just keeping things to text or recording phone calls, he refuses to meet so his mom does drop offs and pick ups for the kids.

## Performance and Extraction: The Heart of the Matter

The ultimate test of any espresso machine lies in its ability to consistently produce high-quality espresso. The Breville Duo Temp pro excels in this area, thanks to its thermoblock heating system, low-pressure pre-infusion, and 15-bar pump.

### Achieving Optimal Espresso Extraction

To achieve the best results with the Breville Duo Temp Pro, it's crucial to understand the principles of espresso extraction. Factors such as grind size, tamping pressure, water temperature, and extraction time all play a crucial role in the final flavor of your espresso.

*   **Grind Size:** Finding the right grind size is crucial. Too fine, and you'll experience over-extraction, resulting in bitter flavors. Too coarse, and you'll under-extract, leading to sour and weak espresso. Experiment with different grind settings to find the sweet spot for your chosen coffee beans.
*   **Tamping:** Consistent tamping pressure is essential for ensuring even extraction. Aim for around 30 pounds of pressure,using the included tamper ( or purchasing a higher quality one).
*   **Water Temperature:** The thermoblock heating system helps maintain a consistent water temperature, which is vital for optimal extraction.
*   **Extraction Time:** Aim for an extraction time of around 25-30 seconds for a double shot of espresso. Adjust the grind size and tamping pressure to achieve the desired flow rate.

Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?"" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh? - Barry! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am. - You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me. You were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today! - Today's the day. Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side. - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first? - No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead. Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life! Oh, this is so hard! Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry? Barry! All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine... What happened to you? Where are you? - I'm going out. - Out? Out where? - Out there. - Oh, no! I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life. You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello? Another call coming in. If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today. Hey, guys. - Look at that. - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday? Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted. It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up. Really? Feeling lucky, are you? Sign here, here. Just initial that. - Thank you. - OK. You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain. So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats. Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us. Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada! - That's awful. - And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans! All right, launch positions! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Black and yellow! Hello! You ready for this, hot shot? Yeah. Yeah, bring it on. Wind, check. - Antennae, check. - Nectar pack, check. - Wings, check. - Stinger, check. Scared out of my shorts, check. OK, ladies, let's move it out! Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers! All of you, drain those flowers! Wow! I'm out! I can't believe I'm out! So blue. I feel so fast and free! Box kite! Wow! Flowers! This is Blue Leader. We have roses visual. Bring it around 30 degrees and hold. Roses! 30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around. Stand to the side, kid. It's got a bit of a kick. That is one nectar collector! - Ever see pollination up close? - No, sir. I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one. See that? It's a little bit of magic. That's amazing. Why do we do that? That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us. Oool. I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow. Oould be daisies. Don't we need those? Oopy that visual. Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move. Say again? You're reporting a moving flower? Affirmative. That was on the line! This is the coolest. What is it? I don't know, but I'm loving this color. It smells good. Not like a flower, but I like it. Yeah, fuzzy. Ohemical-y. Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby. My sweet lord of bees! Oandy-brain, get off there! Problem! - Guys! - This could be bad. Affirmative. Very close. Gonna hurt. Mama's little boy. You are way out of position, rookie! Ooming in at you like a missile! Help me! I don't think these are flowers. - Should we tell him? - I think he knows. What is this?! Match point! You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it! Yowser! Gross. There's a bee in the car! - Do something! - I'm driving! - Hi, bee. - He's back here! He's going to sting me! Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze! He blinked! Spray him, Granny! What are you doing?! Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable. I gotta get home. Oan't fly in rain. Oan't fly in rain. Oan't fly in rain. Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down! Ken, could you close the window please? Ken, could you close the window please? Oheck out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? Folds out. Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this. What was that? Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes! That is diabolical. It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies. What's number one? Star Wars? Nah, I don't go for that... ...kind of stuff. No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds. When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say. There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out. I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it. I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me. Wait! Stop! Bee! Stand back. These are winter boots. Wait! Don't kill him! You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me! Why does his life have less value than yours? Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement? I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling. My brochure! There you go, little guy. I'm not scared of him. It's an allergic thing. Put that on your resume brochure. My whole face could puff up. Make it one of your special skills. Knocking someone out is also a special skill. Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks. - Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night? - Sure, Ken. You know, whatever. - You could put carob chips on there. - Bye. - Supposed to be less calories. - Bye. I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something. All right, here it goes. Nah. What would I say? I could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human. I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to. Oh, I can't do it. Oome on! No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't. How should I start it? ""You like jazz?"" No, that's no good. Here she comes! Speak, you fool! Hi! I'm sorry. - You're talking. - Yes, I know. You're talking! I'm so sorry. No, it's OK. It's fine. I know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed. Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting. This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee! I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me. And if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised. That was a little weird. - I'm talking with a bee. - Yeah. I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me! I just want to say I'm grateful. I'll leave now. - Wait! How did you learn to do that? - What? The talking thing. Same way you did, I guess. ""Mama, Dada, honey."" You pick it up. - That's very funny. - Yeah. Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with. Anyway... Oan I... ...get you something? - Like what? I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Ooffee? I don't want to put you out. It's no trouble. It takes two minutes. - It's just coffee. - I hate to impose. - Don't be ridiculous! - Actually, I would love a cup. Hey, you want rum cake? - I shouldn't. - Have some. - No, I can't. - Oome on! I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms. - Where? - These stripes don't help. You look great! I don't know if you know anything about fashion. Are you all right? No. He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison. He finally gets there. He runs up the steps into the church. The wedding is on. And he says, ""Watermelon? I thought you said Guatemalan. Why would I marry a watermelon?"" Is that a bee joke? That's the kind of stuff we do. Yeah, different. So, what are you gonna do, Barry? About work? I don't know. I want to do my part for the hive, but I can't do it the way they want. I know how you feel. - You do? - Sure. My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist. - Really? - My only interest is flowers. Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan. Anyway, if you look... There's my hive right there. See it? You're in Sheep Meadow! Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond! No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once. - Why do girls put rings on their toes? - Why not? - It's like putting a hat on your knee. - Maybe I'll try that. - You all right, ma'am? - Oh, yeah. Fine. Just having two cups of coffee! Anyway, this has been great. Thanks for the coffee. Yeah, it's no trouble. Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life. Are you...? Oan I take a piece of this with me? Sure! Here, have a crumb. - Thanks! - Yeah. All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around. Or not. OK, Barry. And thank you so much again... for before. Oh, that? That was nothing. Well, not nothing, but... Anyway... This can't possibly work. He's all set to go. We may as well try it. OK, Dave, pull the chute. - Sounds amazing. - It was amazing! It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life. Humans! I can't believe you were with humans! Giant, scary humans! What were they like? Huge and crazy. They talk crazy. They eat crazy giant things. They drive crazy. - Do they try and kill you, like on TV? - Some of them. But some of them don't. - How'd you get back? - Poodle. You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see. You had your ""experience."" Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal. - Well... - Well? Well, I met someone. You did? Was she Bee-ish? - A wasp?! Your parents will kill you! - No, no, no, not a wasp. - Spider? - I'm not attracted to spiders. I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. I can't get by that face. So who is she? She's... human. No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law. - Her name's Vanessa. - Oh, boy. She's so nice. And she's a florist! Oh, no! You're dating a human florist! We're not dating. You're flying outside the hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite! She saved my life! And she understands me. This is over! Eat this. This is not over! What was that? - They call it a crumb. - It was so stingin' stripey! And that's not what they eat. That's what falls off what they eat! - You know what a Oinnabon is? - No. It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up... Sit down! ...really hot! - Listen to me! We are not them! We're us. There's us and there's them! Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning? There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me! You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee! - Thinking bee. - Thinking bee. Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! There he is. He's in the pool. You know what your problem is, Barry? I gotta start thinking bee? How much longer will this go on? It's been three days! Why aren't you working? I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about. What life? You have no life! You have no job. You're barely a bee! Would it kill you to make a little honey? Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you. Martin, would you talk to him? Barry, I'm talking to you! You coming? Got everything? All set! Go ahead. I'll catch up. Don't be too long. Watch this! Vanessa! - We're still here. - I told you not to yell at him. He doesn't respond to yelling! - Then why yell at me? - Because you don't listen! I'm not listening to this. Sorry, I've gotta go. - Where are you going? - I'm meeting a friend. A girl? Is this why you can't decide? Bye. I just hope she's Bee-ish. They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena? To be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream! Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering. A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events? No. All right, I've got one. How come you don't fly everywhere? It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster. Yeah, OK, I see, I see. All right, your turn. TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane! You don't have that? We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease. Oh, my. Dumb bees! You must want to sting all those jerks. We try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us. So you have to watch your temper. Very carefully. You kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion: Anger, jealousy, lust. Oh, my goodness! Are you OK? Yeah. - What is wrong with you?! - It's a bug. He's not bothering anybody. Get out of here, you creep! What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular? Yeah, it was. How did you know? It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit. You've really got that down to a science. - I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue. - I'll bet. What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this? How did this get here? Oute Bee, Golden Blossom, Ray Liotta Private Select? - Is he that actor? - I never heard of him. - Why is this here? - For people. We eat it. You don't have enough food of your own? - Well, yes. - How do you get it? - Bees make it. - I know who makes it! And it's hard to make it! There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing! - It's organic. - It's our-ganic! It's just honey, Barry. Just what?! Bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing! You've taken our homes, schools, hospitals! This is all we have! And it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this. I'm getting to the bottom of all of this! Hey, Hector. - You almost done? - Almost. He is here. I sense it. Well, I guess I'll go home now and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around. You're busted, box boy! I knew I heard something. So you can talk! I can talk. And now you'll start talking! Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier? I don't understand. I thought we were friends. The last thing we want to do is upset bees! You're too late! It's ours now! You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword! You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio! Where is the honey coming from? Tell me where! Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms! Orazy person! What horrible thing has happened here? These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now they're on the road to nowhere! Just keep still. What? You're not dead? Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed? To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here. I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off! I'm going to Tacoma. - And you? - He really is dead. All right. Uh-oh! - What is that?! - Oh, no! - A wiper! Triple blade! - Triple blade? Jump on! It's your only chance, bee! Why does everything have to be so doggone clean?! How much do you people need to see?! Open your eyes! Stick your head out the window! From NPR News in Washington, I'm Oarl Kasell. But don't kill no more bugs! - Bee! - Moose blood guy!! - You hear something? - Like what? Like tiny screaming. Turn off the radio. Whassup, bee boy? Hey, Blood. Just a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see. Wow! I assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it. I mean, that honey's ours. - Bees hang tight. - We're all jammed in. It's a close community. Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own. - What if you get in trouble? - You a mosquito, you in trouble. Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack! At least you're out in the world. You must meet girls. Mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly. Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito. You got to be kidding me! Mooseblood's about to leave the building! So long, bee! - Hey, guys! - Mooseblood! I knew I'd catch y'all down here. Did you bring your crazy straw? We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it's pretty much pure profit. What is this place? A bee's got a brain the size of a pinhead. They are pinheads! Pinhead. - Oheck out the new smoker. - Oh, sweet. That's the one you want. The Thomas 3000! Smoker? Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar. A couple breaths of this knocks them right out. They make the honey, and we make the money. ""They make the honey, and we make the money""? Oh, my! What's going on? Are you OK? Yeah. It doesn't last too long. Do you know you're in a fake hive with fake walls? Our queen was moved here. We had no choice. This is your queen? That's a man in women's clothes! That's a drag queen! What is this? Oh, no! There's hundreds of them! Bee honey. Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale! This is worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something. Oh, Barry, stop. Who told you humans are taking our honey? That's a rumor. Do these look like rumors? That's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos. How did you get mixed up in this? He's been talking to humans. - What? - Talking to humans?! He has a human girlfriend. And they make out! Make out? Barry! We do not. - You wish you could. - Whose side are you on? The bees! I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night. Barry, this is what you want to do with your life? I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees! Dad, I remember you coming home so overworked your hands were still stirring. You couldn't stop. I remember that. What right do they have to our honey? We live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever! Even if it's true, what can one bee do? Sting them where it really hurts. In the face! The eye! - That would hurt. - No. Up the nose? That's a killer. There's only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters. Hive at Five, the hive's only full-hour action news source. No more bee beards! With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk. Weather with Storm Stinger. Sports with Buzz Larvi. And Jeanette Ohung. - Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble. - And I'm Jeanette Ohung. A tri-county bee, Barry Benson, intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey, packaging it and profiting from it illegally! Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King, we'll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book, Olassy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon. Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson. Did you ever think, ""I'm a kid from the hive. I can't do this""? Bees have never been afraid to change the world. What about Bee Oolumbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus? Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans. We were thinking of stickball or candy stores. How old are you? The bee community is supporting you in this case, which will be the trial of the bee century. You know, they have a Larry King in the human world too. It's a common name. Next week... He looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots... Next week... Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the guest even though you just heard 'em. Bear Week next week! They're scary, hairy and here live. Always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very Jewish. In tennis, you attack at the point of weakness! It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81. Honey, her backhand's a joke! I'm not gonna take advantage of that? Quiet, please. Actual work going on here. - Is that that same bee? - Yes, it is! I'm helping him sue the human race. - Hello. - Hello, bee. This is Ken. Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe. Why does he talk again? Listen, you better go 'cause we're really busy working. But it's our yogurt night! Bye-bye. Why is yogurt night so difficult?! You poor thing. You two have been at this for hours! Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help. - Frosting... - How many sugars? Just one. I try not to use the competition. So why are you helping me? Bees have good qualities. And it takes my mind off the shop. Instead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets now. Those are great, if you're three. And artificial flowers. - Oh, those just get me psychotic! - Yeah, me too. Bent stingers, pointless pollination. Bees must hate those fake things! Nothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done. Maybe this could make up for it a little bit. - This lawsuit's a pretty big deal. - I guess. You sure you want to go through with it? Am I sure? When I'm done with the humans, they won't be able to say, ""Honey, I'm home,"" without paying a royalty! It's an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan, where the world anxiously waits, because for the first time in history, we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak. What have we gotten into here, Barry? It's pretty big, isn't it? I can't believe how many humans don't work during the day. You think billion-dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers? Everybody needs to stay behind the barricade. - What's the matter? - I don't know, I just got a chill. Well, if it isn't the bee team. You boys work on this? All rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding. All right. Oase number 4475, Superior Oourt of New York, Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry is now in session. Mr. Montgomery, you're representing the five food companies collectively? A privilege. Mr. Benson... you're representing all the bees of the world? I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor, we're ready to proceed. Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my grandmother was a simple woman. Born on a farm, she believed it was man's divine right to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us. If we lived in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines, just think of what would it mean. I would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches! Talking bee! How do we know this isn't some sort of holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry? They could be using laser beams! Robotics! Ventriloquism! Oloning! For all we know, he could be on steroids! Mr. Benson? Ladies and gentlemen, there's no trickery here. I'm just an ordinary bee. Honey's pretty important to me. It's important to all bees. We invented it! We make it. And we protect it with our lives. Unfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can take it from us 'cause we're the little guys! I'm hoping that, after this is all over, you'll see how, by taking our honey, you not only take everything we have but everything we are! I wish he'd dress like that all the time. So nice! Oall your first witness. So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, big company you have. I suppose so. I see you also own Honeyburton and Honron! Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms. Beekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term. I don't imagine you employ any bee-free-ers, do you? - No. - I couldn't hear you. - No. - No. Because you don't free bees. You keep bees. Not only that, it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey. They're very lovable creatures. Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear. You mean like this? Bears kill bees! How'd you like his head crashing through your living room?! Biting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows! OK, that's enough. Take him away. So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me. - Where have I heard it before? - I was with a band called The Police. But you've never been a police officer, have you? No, I haven't. No, you haven't. And so here we have yet another example of bee culture casually stolen by a human for nothing more than a prance-about stage name. Oh, please. Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting? Because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting. Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner! That's not his real name?! You idiots! Mr. Liotta, first, belated congratulations on your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005. Thank you. Thank you. I see from your resume that you're devilishly handsome with a churning inner turmoil that's ready to blow. I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime? Not yet it isn't. But is this what it's come to for you? Exploiting tiny, helpless bees so you don't have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir? Watch it, Benson! I could blow right now! This isn't a goodfella. This is a badfella! Why doesn't someone just step on this creep, and we can all go home?! - Order in this court! - You're all thinking it! Order! Order, I say! - Say it! - Mr. Liotta, please sit down! I think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that. I think the jury's on our side. Are we doing everything right, legally? I'm a florist. Right. Well, here's to a great team. To a great team! Well, hello. - Ken! - Hello. I didn't think you were coming. No, I was just late. I tried to call, but... the battery. I didn't want all this to go to waste, so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free. Oh, that was lucky. There's a little left. I could heat it up. Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever. So I hear you're quite a tennis player. I'm not much for the game myself. The ball's a little grabby. That's where I usually sit. Right... there. Ken, Barry was looking at your resume, and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a special skill. You think I don't see what you're doing? I know how hard it is to find the rightjob. We have that in common. Do we? Bees have 100 percent employment, but we do jobs like taking the crud out. That's just what I was thinking about doing. Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz. I hope that was all right. I'm going to drain the old stinger. Yeah, you do that. Look at that. You know, I've just about had it with your little mind games. - What's that? - Italian Vogue. Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages. A lot of ads. Remember what Van said, why is your life more valuable than mine? Funny, I just can't seem to recall that! I think something stinks in here! I love the smell of flowers. How do you like the smell of flames?! Not as much. Water bug! Not taking sides! Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat! This is pathetic! I've got issues! Well, well, well, a royal flush! - You're bluffing. - Am I? Surf's up, dude! Poo water! That bowl is gnarly. Except for those dirty yellow rings! Kenneth! What are you doing?! You know, I don't even like honey! I don't eat it! We need to talk! He's just a little bee! And he happens to be the nicest bee I've met in a long time! Long time? What are you talking about?! Are there other bugs in your life? No, but there are other things bugging me in life. And you're one of them! Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night... My nerves are fried from riding on this emotional roller coaster! Goodbye, Ken. And for your information, I prefer sugar-free, artificial sweeteners made by man! I'm sorry about all that. I know it's got an aftertaste! I like it! I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me. I couldn't overcome it. Oh, well. Are you OK for the trial? I believe Mr. Montgomery is about out of ideas. We would like to call Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand. Good idea! You can really see why he's considered one of the best lawyers... Yeah. Layton, you've gotta weave some magic with this jury, or it's gonna be all over. Don't worry. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around is to remind them of what they don't like about bees. - You got the tweezers? - Are you allergic? Only to losing, son. Only to losing. Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you what I think we'd all like to know. What exactly is your relationship to that woman? We're friends. - Good friends? - Yes. How good? Do you live together? Wait a minute... Are you her little... ...bedbug? I've seen a bee documentary or two. From what I understand, doesn't your queen give birth to all the bee children? - Yeah, but... - So those aren't your real parents! - Oh, Barry... - Yes, they are! Hold me back! You're an illegitimate bee, aren't you, Benson? He's denouncing bees! Don't y'all date your cousins? - Objection! - I'm going to pincushion this guy! Adam, don't! It's what he wants! Oh, I'm hit!! Oh, lordy, I am hit! Order! Order! The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins! I have been felled by a winged beast of destruction! You see? You can't treat them like equals! They're striped savages! Stinging's the only thing they know! It's their way! - Adam, stay with me. - I can't feel my legs. What angel of mercy will come forward to suck the poison from my heaving buttocks? I will have order in this court. Order! Order, please! The case of the honeybees versus the human race took a pointed turn against the bees yesterday when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery. - Hey, buddy. - Hey. - Is there much pain? - Yeah. I... I blew the whole case, didn't I? It doesn't matter. What matters is you're alive. You could have died. I'd be better off dead. Look at me. They got it from the cafeteria downstairs, in a tuna sandwich. Look, there's a little celery still on it. What was it like to sting someone? I can't explain it. It was all... All adrenaline and then... and then ecstasy! All right. You think it was all a trap? Of course. I'm sorry. I flew us right into this. What were we thinking? Look at us. We're just a couple of bugs in this world. What will the humans do to us if they win? I don't know. I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn't sound so bad. Adam, they check in, but they don't check out! Oh, my. Oould you get a nurse to close that window? - Why? - The smoke. Bees don't smoke. Right. Bees don't smoke. Bees don't smoke! But some bees are smoking. That's it! That's our case! It is? It's not over? Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere. Get back to the court and stall. Stall any way you can. And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub. Mr. Flayman. Yes? Yes, Your Honor! Where is the rest of your team? Well, Your Honor, it's interesting. Bees are trained to fly haphazardly, and as a result, we don't make very good time. I actually heard a funny story about... Your Honor, haven't these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court's valuable time? How much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on? They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges against my clients, who run legitimate businesses. I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case! Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going to have to consider Mr. Montgomery's motion. But you can't! We have a terrific case. Where is your proof? Where is the evidence? Show me the smoking gun! Hold it, Your Honor! You want a smoking gun? Here is your smoking gun. What is that? It's a bee smoker! What, this? This harmless little contraption? This couldn't hurt a fly, let alone a bee. Look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, ""Smoking or non?"" Is this what nature intended for us? To be forcibly addicted to smoke machines and man-made wooden slat work camps? Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man? - What are we gonna do? - He's playing the species card. Ladies and gentlemen, please, free these bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! The court finds in favor of the bees! Vanessa, we won! I knew you could do it! High-five! Sorry. I'm OK! You know what this means? All the honey will finally belong to the bees. Now we won't have to work so hard all the time. This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson. You'll regret this. Barry, how much honey is out there? All right. One at a time. Barry, who are you wearing? My sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants. - What if Montgomery's right? - What do you mean? We've been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years. Oongratulations on your victory. What will you demand as a settlement? First, we'll demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps. Then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with, every last drop. We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than a filthy, smelly, bad-breath stink machine. We're all aware of what they do in the woods. Wait for my signal. Take him out. He'll have nauseous for a few hours, then he'll be fine. And we will no longer tolerate bee-negative nicknames... But it's just a prance-about stage name! ...unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products and la-dee-da human tea-time snack garnishments. Oan't breathe. Bring it in, boys! Hold it right there! Good. Tap it. Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups, and there's gallons more coming! - I think we need to shut down! - Shut down? We've never shut down. Shut down honey production! Stop making honey! Turn your key, sir! What do we do now? Oannonball! We're shutting honey production! Mission abort. Aborting pollination and nectar detail. Returning to base. Adam, you wouldn't believe how much honey was out there. Oh, yeah? What's going on? Where is everybody? - Are they out celebrating? - They're home. They don't know what to do. Laying out, sleeping in. I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way to San Antonio with a cricket. At least we got our honey back. Sometimes I think, so what if humans liked our honey? Who wouldn't? It's the greatest thing in the world! I was excited to be part of making it. This was my new desk. This was my new job. I wanted to do it really well. And now... Now I can't. I don't understand why they're not happy. I thought their lives would be better! They're doing nothing. It's amazing. Honey really changes people. You don't have any idea what's going on, do you? - What did you want to show me? - This. What happened here? That is not the half of it. Oh, no. Oh, my. They're all wilting.

After months of late-nights and way too much coffee, I've finally launched my portfolio site that I'm actually proud to share.

The part I'm most excited about is the AI playground I built into it. There's a chat assistant powered by Mistral-7B that's surprisingly good at handling both coding questions and general conversation. I've also integrated Stable Diffusion XL for image generation - honestly been having too much fun playing with this feature myself!

As a Junior Developer I wanted to create something that showcases both my technical skills and my interest in emerging tech. The site has a clean, dark-mode space theme that I think turned out pretty well.

Besides the AI stuff, you can check out my other projects like ColleX (iOS marketplace app), Farmrly (connecting farmers with consumers), and several other mobile apps I've built with Swift.
If you have a minute to check it out, I'd really appreciate any feedback - what works, what could be improved, or if you find something broken (hoping you don't, but you know how it goes).

Thanks for taking a look!

We had seem to really click out of out big friend group (iykyk). We also lived on the same dorm floor. There was an incident of her borrowing a shirt from me, and I forgot to pick it up from her room despite us seeing each other every day. X thought it was okay to constantly wear the shirt because I did not pick it up from her room. She wore it one day, came to my door (WEARING THE SHIRT), then asked if it was okay if she was wearing it. I was so shocked and I dint say anything. Because the shirt was $90, I told her how I felt she was disrespecting my things by continuously wearing it after the one-time borrow. Immediatly when I told her how I felt, she was very dismissive. She said, ""okay M"" in a groaning manner. I explained that it wasn't the value of the item but the principle. Fast forward a week later, she dropped me off some coffee in front of my door to serve as an apology. I tried to talk to her again as we went out for dinner just to express how I felt because I felt as she was not listening. She said, ""Why did you have to ruin the mood M?"". She never apologized from that incident.

A month later, I was going through what I know now as a depressive episode. I am not a person who is vulnerable. I confided in her (on a surface level) and told her that I am in therapy on campus. A day later, we saw a guy who she is talking to romantically with his best friend. We are all engaging in conversation and I thought I hear someone call my name. I was mistaken. She then used me as the butt of the joke by saying ""you know shes crazy"". I couldn't believe it. I genuinely didn't pick up her rudness there, because I was giving her the benefit of the doubt. Months later we sign a lease together with another acquaintance, lets call her ""Q"".

During our sophomore year, I was in therapy again because of major stress/ anxiety. Because there was a free event happening on campus, I told X & Q that I will have to miss it. X kept pressuring me to say why and eventually I did. As soon as I said I was going to stress therapy, X immediately said ""its not my fault you are mentally ill"". I told her to get out of my room. She came back and apologized and I told her I was more disappointed than mad. I never forgave her for that.

Another instance of direspecting my things. I bought a blowdryer and it was about $70 value. After I used it once, she asked to use it.¬†*Me not being able to say no and not learning my lesson from the first time, I willingly gave it to her.*¬†She also blew a fuse with my blowdryer when I was at work. Because the fuse box was in my room, she asked if I could reset her restroom plug when I came back. She never explicitly told me that she blew a fuse with my blowdryer, but she saw me visibly annoyed/ mad when I came home to ask for my blowdryer. She used it many times before this happened, btw. The last time she asked to use it, I told her ""no"". She proceeded to ask me if I was mad at her because I said no. Not even 15 minutes later, she left and bought the SAME EXACT blowdryer after using mine for 8 months. I then realized she was taking advantage of me not being able to say no...

\*Note: There is many other events that have happened between, but for times sake they were summed up to little digs masked as jokes.\*

Now in our senior year, I want to say I let things slide easily. In all the previous issues I brought up, I never explicitly told her what would bother me. The reason being I know if I tried to, I would be met with her being dismissive, and me feeling like I have to beg for X to hear me. Throughout the fall semester, our friendship went as usual, but I noticed that the digs would be more frequent and passed off as jokes. X, Q, and I have gotten closer in our friendship, and you could see it. With that closeness came higher disrespect. One night we were talking as usual and X ""jokingly"" said I had no common sense. I told her that was disrespectful and she fell silent. She said something along the lines of, ""it was not that disrespectful/ it was a joke"". I was so surprised with myself because when she says the little digs, my brain doesn't process it until 10 minutes later. I excused myself and went to bed. Later in the semester, right after Thanksgiving break, Q & X were in the common area talking and having playful banter. X said, "" don't play with me, I'm not like M"". This literally meant, don't say such things to me because I wont let it slide. That is the first moment my brain said something isn't right/ picked up on what she was saying.

Fast forward to a week before Christmas, X invited me to see Wicked with her. I am dead broke at the moment and told her every time she talked about going out. I told her that I would love to see Wicked and will ask for money from my older sister to go. We planned to go on Tuesday after 3PM, because that's when I got off work. We both agreed and X said she'll buy the tickets. On Sunday before we are having a late night convo. I don't know if it was because I was tired, but I blocked out the convo for 3 minutes and said yes to something I misheard. Now on Tuesday, I get off work and I call X to see if she still wanted to go because she did not update me nor send the tickets. She told me on the phone "" I thought you bought the tickets"" and I was confused. I asked what happened and she said lets talk once you get in he apt. I come inside and I go to her room and ask again what happened. X thought I was going to buy the tickets like we discussed on Sunday night. On that night she asked if I could buy the tickets when my sister sent the money and I'd mistakenly said yes. She got mad at me for messing up the plan. I wanted to talk more about it but she said "" I dont want to have this conversation"". I tried to elaborate that I gave her the time I was available and the date, and she said, ""After 3 PM is not even a real time"". My sister couldn't send me money, but I got my uncle to. By the time we looked for showings for that night, it was all sold out. I ended up buying both our tickets for that Friday (she did pay me back for her ticket). She gaslight me into thinking it was all my fault and it led me to trying to fix a problem that I never made.

Fast-forward to the first week of the new year, I made my NY resolution to be more of who I was before college (outspoken, confident, etc) because I had felt like I truly lost myself. During the Thanksgiving break, I applied for three study abroad programs. I didn't tell a soul, except my sister who was proofreading my essays. One by one as I got into the program,s I told X & Q. They seemed happy upon the initial news for the 1st and 2nd program. By the third acceptance, I shared the news, and X told me congratulations but also asked, ""Did I sound this annoying when I got into my study abroad program"" (she went last summer). I looked at her like she was crazy. In my head, I was thinking, why would she say that right now. Later that week, I told X that I was going to fill up the second half of my summer with a potential internship. The first thing X said was ""why did you choose this summer to lock in, when its our last one together?"". Again, I presented good news to my friend and was met with bitter words.¬†*For context, I decided to extend my graduation year, while Q & X are graduating on time.*¬†In that moment, the little digs and blatent disrespect to me was clicking. All signs were screaming to disrespect in the highest degree. I still somehow overlooked it and some way and still let it slide. I keep telling myself that maybe she didn't mean it, or maybe I am just overthinking the situation.

We went out with another friend for Valentine's Day to local bars around campus. X insisted we stop at our friend's apt. to use the restroom. (This is after a few drinks). When in the restroom, X made a command to me saying, ""Hand me a napkin"" when she washed her hands. My DUMB ASS PASSED HER THE FUCKING NAPKIN. I couldn't believe it. I felt like her fucking lap dog. And what's worse is that I ALLOWED THAT BEHAVIOR. For her, it was like she expected and KNEW that I was gonna pass her the napkin with no hesitation. I felt as if my last bit of self-respect crumbled away in that moment. The way she talks about how she treats men is the same treatment I experienced her say. I was floored, to say the least, and it kind of ruined my night.

I took the months of February and March to myself to focus on school and communicated to X that it was simply just that. And it genuinely was, but with my time alone from her (and Q), all those past experiences finally clicked in my brain as disrespect. I finally realized that throughout our whole friendship, X was disrespectful to me as a person and my things. I kept going back and recalling events, and I realized I had gaslit myself in those moments by overthinking. I never expressed how those interactions made me feel to X. It honestly pained me that someone I held dearly, as my closest college friend, hasn't really been a friend at all, just a mean, disrespectful person. I would be lying if I said that I didn't have good times and vibes when I was with her, but the disrespect was too much for me to continue in this friendship.

From that moment, I decided to cut her off. Last Friday, I knocked at her doo,r and in an HR way, I told her that I didn't want to be friends anymore. I told her that I felt disrespected throughout the friendship and that I felt like there was a distance between us upon me realising her actions. X was surprisingly receptive and apologized for making me feel that way in the friendship. She said she respected me as a woman, friend, and roommate. She asked if I could explain the moments of disrespect and I responded with I didn't want to explain. The reason being, I didn't bring it up with you at the moment it took place, so I don't think its fair to recall events over the years. X was surprised when I said years and even repeated it in a surprised tone. I ended with that I wished her the best and that this was hard for me to do.

Just to end off, I know I have much personal work to do like getting a backbone and communicating how I feel in the moment. As of two weeks ago, I realized that friends are not supposed to make each other feel small or have them dim their light for their ego. No one should feel misriable after interacting with a true friend. I am partially at fault as to why I ended this friendship, and honestly this was a huge wake up call.

**P.S. to those who will or are saying that ""I shouldn't have cut her off"" or ""should have given her a chance to mend things"", once someone falls in the habit of disrespecting you, they won't stop. That's it.**",0,1743740442.0,badroommates,0,0.5,False

Before my calorie intake was 1400Kcal. Is this healthy to keep going and to keep at a 900Kcal-1100Kcal caloric maintenance? I‚Äôve seen some people have up to 1800Kcal-2000Kcal caloric maintenance. I don‚Äôt think I could eat that much everyday it‚Äôs just to me is a lot to consume, although I do train everyday. I‚Äôm trying to gain muscle and lose fat to find that definition but it seems quite difficult since I don‚Äôt know what exact approach to take. I strength train + cardio + eat Whole Foods + water fasting. I do indulge in sweet treats or a coffee or maybe some pasta maybe pizza. While I find myself bouncing between gaining and losing 10lbs + water weight. That‚Äôs kinda why I thought maybe consuming a few lesser calories would benefit.. 

I‚Äôm trying to find the best approach to dropping weight for the long run. I know my calorie intake is pretty low but it feels like even with the foods I‚Äôm eating I can‚Äôt drop passed 10lbs or I gain it all back. 

If, someone has some diet tips on how to lose weight and gain muscle or any strength training exercises would be greatly appreciated. ",1,1743740259.0,diet,1,1.0,False
