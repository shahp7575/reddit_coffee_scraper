1gwrryx,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1gwrryx/how_do_i_know_if_she_still_just_wants_to_be/,How do I know if she still just wants to be friends? ,"Im in a tricky situation where a friend (23F) and I (25M) have strong chemistry but know there is unlikely to be longevity in a relationship. The story is at follows:

A few months ago I moved to a newly opened gym and started to get along really well with one of the staff members. 

After ~3 weeks of me going to this gym, the staff member and I had started to develop somewhat of a friendship. This mainly included having brief chats everytime we saw each other at the gym, her giving me the occasional free coffee, and exercising together a couple times (both happened to be there at the same time). By this point I was convinced there was some chemistry between us that I couldn't help but wanting to explore. 

On one particular afternoon, I went to the gym in the afternoon to pick up a water bottle I had left the night before (we had spoken / exercised together that previous night). To my surprise she was there again at the gym exercising, where she mentioned she'd be working till late that night. 

After retrieving my bottle and leaving the gym, I went home, had dinner, put on my exercise clothes and went back to the gym, with only one purpose - ask out this girl and get her number.

I walk into the gym where she immediately sees me whilst being occupied with a customer. I thought oh shit my plan has failed and started chatting to another friend in the gym to keep my cool. Next minute she comes up to me asking why I am back and I said ""I'm here to ask you out for a drink"". She said yes and gave me her number. 

Fast forward a couple weeks, we had gone out with some of her friends but not quite got a drink 1 on 1. The first night I went out with her friends it was pretty strange and not at all what I had hoped for. 

The next week we spoke about the night and came to terms that it's probably best we stay friends. The main rationale was that she didn't want anything to happen that might make her new job at the gym weird or awkward. We both agreed that we really enjoyed spending time with each other and that a friendship would be valuable 

Fast forward another few weeks and we were catching up more frequently outside the gym and texting daily (sending lots of memes to each other). At this point I could feel my intentions for a friendship being heavily challenged so I let her know I needed to take a step back in the friendship to gather my bearings again. 

We didn't speak for almost a week, apart from briefly bumping into each other a couple times at the gym. Through this short period I thought I had come to terms with us never developing anything more than a close friendship. This was due to us having differing religious beliefs, albeit having very similar outlooks on life, especially towards relationships.  

We began messaging again pretty consistently and during this week alone went out for dinner and were at gym together multiple times. Yesterday we both had the day off so decided it would be nice to head outdoors for a day trip. We ended up spending ~ 12 hours in each other's company where we finished the day off with a few beers at a pub. Throughout a lot of the day we spoke more about how our values align yet acknowledged our differing religious outlooks. Neither of us greatly observse out respective religions, yet feel they are part of our identities (Im Jewish and she is Christian). 

We laughed a bunch, overcame challenges, had great conversation all day together and I now I'm convinced there is mutual attraction/ interest in something more than just a friendship. The trajectory of our friendship is following a similar trend to how most of my past relationships have started (organically meet > start hanging out a bunch > start becoming physically intimate) 

I'm at a bit of a cross roads, on the one side I'm still not 100% sure if she is just enjoying the friendship for what it is. On the other side, the more we hang out, the more the chemistry between us grows. I think we are both hesitant to take the friendship any further based on the  conflict of religious interest, but I don't know how to digest my current emotions towards her. 

TL;DR, I met a staff member at a new gym and asked her out. After hanging out a bit we agreed to be friends due to her new job and a conflict of religious interests. We started hanging out a bunch more and realised we have very similar outlooks on life, especially towards relationships. Today we spent ~12 hours together and I am feeling the chemistry is now too good where I don't know how to digest the situation any more.

Is she leading me on? It is wise of me to continue to just be friends? How might I go about suggesting we try develop our relationship further? Please give me your most constructive advice! ",1,1732226894.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False
1gwrru9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gwrru9/my_girlfriend_has_left_me_now_i_want_to_go_far/,"My girlfriend has left me; now I want to go far away, even if it means destroying everything.","I always thought that being abandoned by my parents was the worst thing that could happen to a child. You see, children born without a gift are sent to ""the Zone,"" a place where they eventually meet their end. In that wasteland, cities are skeletons, and people are mere shadows of what they once were. Those of us who managed to survive quickly learned never to trust anyone.

I was fourteen when I discovered my power. It all began with a tiny black hole, the size of a marble, that appeared before me in a moment of despair. I had stolen food from a group of raiders who were chasing me like ravenous wolves. There was no way out. Then, I felt it—a strange vibration in the air, like a hum deep inside my head. In the blink of an eye, I was somewhere else.

The world I arrived in wasn’t better than my own. But it was different. And that was enough.

For years, I jumped from universe to universe. Each one had its own rules, its own logic. In one, people lived in floating cities suspended among clouds. In another, the sky burned like an eternal canvas of fire while it rained coal. Some worlds were peaceful; others, deadly. I learned to adapt, to survive, and even made a few friends along the way. Over time, I discovered how to guide the portals toward places closer to what I imagined.

I didn’t realize the cost until much later.

One day, I arrived in a place I thought I had imagined: Earth. This world wasn’t like the others. It had chaos and beauty, but also something inexplicable: humanity. And there, I met Sofía.

We crossed paths in a run-down café. I was the stranger who didn’t know how to use coins; she was the girl who smiled and paid for my coffee. It was a gesture that seemed insignificant, but to someone like me—used to disdain and distrust—it was like a spark in the dark.

With Sofía, I learned what it meant to truly live. She introduced me to music, something I had never experienced in the worlds I visited. We danced in unexpected rain, laughed at my clumsiness, and I cried without shame. For the first time, I stopped jumping from universe to universe. I stayed.

She was everything I didn’t know I needed: laughter amid chaos, patience for my emotional clumsiness, and a quiet strength that made the world seem less bleak. She listened to me. She understood me. And because of her, I stopped running.

Sofía also encouraged me to confront my past. One night, after weeks of conversations, I decided to return to my home universe to seek answers and perhaps find closure. With more precision than ever, I opened the portal.

What I found was devastating.

My home, my parents, the friends I had made on my journeys... everything had been consumed by the black holes I had created. Every leap that saved me had condemned an entire universe.

The guilt was unbearable. I couldn’t bring myself to tell Sofía. Instead, I shut myself off. My bitterness grew like a cancer, pushing her further and further away. I still remember the day she looked at me for the last time, tears in her eyes, searching for an explanation. But I only stared back coldly. Without a word, I let her leave.

She had tried to help me, but in the end, my darkness consumed her too.

Now I am alone. I have nothing left to stay for. Maybe I could start over somewhere else, but how could I justify destroying another world?

The question that haunts me is simple: will I risk this universe for one last leap, or will I accept that my punishment is to remain here, in the one place that was never truly mine?

The air intake through my right nostril is significantly reduced, and it's frequently blocked.

I NEVER wake up feeling refreshed. I wake up feeling like a truck hit me despite getting plenty of sleep and not using an alarm. I struggle to get out of bed. I chalked it up to ADHD/delayed wake phase disorder. 

I start the day with coffee, and it takes me a good hour or so to feel fully awake and functional. I never have an appetite in the morning. I'm not sure if this is relevant.

I'm fairly sure I breathe through my mouth in my sleep, as I often drool and wake up with a dry mouth. Sometimes I choke on my saliva in my sleep, too. 

My nose is always runny in the morning.

I asked my doctor about sleep apnea a year ago, and he quickly dismissed it because I don't feel sleepy during the day. I never looked into it further until now.

I've never felt quite right. It's always felt as though I'm playing life on hard mode. I'm diagnosed with ADHD, and I have struggled with mental health issues and addiction throughout my life. 

I use a fluticasone spray daily, but it doesn't do much. I've used oxymetazoline in the past, and it works amazingly well, but you're only meant to use it for a few days.

I know this isn't the place for a diagnosis, and I'm going to seek help, but I'm curious if this sounds like sleep apnea and whether anyone else with a deviated septum has/had similar issues. 

In the meantime, do you have any tips you could give me? Have you found any products that help?

We live about an hour from the parks and are early birds anyway, so we decided to save some money by not staying at a resort. My question is: if the park opens at 9 AM, how early can we actually get in? I noticed the app mentions early entry at 8:30 AM, but is that only for resort guests?

I also understand that getting through parking and into Magic Kingdom takes time. How early should we plan to arrive at the TTC to make it inside the park by 8:30 AM? What is the process to get into the park like? Any advice would be appreciated!",1,1732226301.0,disneyparks,0,1.0,False

We're lab partners, she always sits next to me at lectures or lunch, and typically won't talk to anyone other than me even when we're typically sat in a group. 

I go to a roller-skating club on campus which I really enjoy, so she decided she's coming too. I got the feeling she's doing it because I do it (she said that if she had to join a club it would be that one since figure skating isn't a club here) and as I don't have my own roller-skates, I felt bad when I actually felt some relief when I realised that this week is own-skates-only sessions so I couldn't go. 

I have 2 events with other people going ice skating for Christmas, and she wanted to go ice skating as well. Since it would be 3 ice skating things in 1 week for me, I gently suggested that we could do some Christmas shopping and get a coffee before an evening lecture, but she kept pushing for going ice skating. I've just resigned myself to it, since I think she really wants to go but doesn't have anyone else to go with. 

I wonder if that's maybe why she's become so attached, since she doesn't seem to have any other plans or groups or friends she hangs out with, but I really feel like I need to do stuff on my own. Without her.

I would love some advice!,"So I am working at a brand new bakery/coffee shop that opened less than two weeks ago. 
During my interview, before opening, they told me they were also needing a manager. 

I didn’t expect them to ask me so soon, but we are having a meeting tomorrow to discuss the managerial position. Earlier this week they basically already told me that I had the manager position, so this meeting is to discuss what my job will entail. 

I really need advice from anyone who is in a coffee shop manager position. What should I expect to be doing as a manager? How should I approach talking about pay? And most importantly what questions should I ask the two business owners?

For more context, the two business owners both have full times job outside of the coffee shop. The one owner, Is the baker. She is the one who had the dream for the bakery/coffee shop. Her specialty is being a bread baker. She doesn’t even really know coffee. We are partnered with a local coffee roaster, and three of us baristas have had previous barista experience, so our coffee is really good. It’s just not either of the business owners expertise.
This owner though has a full time job as an office manager at a local natural health shop.
 
The second owner is purely just an investor. He’s a chiropractor, and knows nothing about baking or coffee. 

Both are great people, and I’m loving working for them. The problem is, they already have been super hands off. The chiropractor already rarely comes in, and the other owner is only there after hours to bake. Which has led to a lack of management. We have no inventory lists. No employee policies or store policies. No cleaning policies or schedules set in place. Shift scheduling has been done poorly. Within the first week I had to come in twice when I wasn’t scheduled. We’ve been selling out of all baked goods everyday before noon. They still haven’t figured out card tips, and they haven’t been having us report cash tips. There has also been some things that weren’t thought of or provided for us. Like us baristas didn’t even have jiggers, and we were borrowing our bean roasters grinder and scale for the pour overs. 

So basically if I become manager I’m going to have to completely create policies and systems for the whole store and its future. How much managing should I expect to do myself vs asking or expecting the owners to do? Like would I be crazy to tell them to up their baking production by a lot? 

Any of you other managers, please please tell me any advice you have! Also any programs/apps you use to help manage the business! Are there any places I should look into for ordering ingredient inventory? What questions should I be asking the owners, in the meeting tomorrow? Anything would be helpful!

Ever since seeing those Lego castles back then, I was hooked and always wanted the large knight castles but of course it was expensive. 

Anyway, back to a few weeks ago, I fell back in love with the Lego castles and thought I would be able to make those now with all my old legos! I clicked on a link, did some searching and found a modular castle. Perfect. I’ll start with the gate house. Grab my bins of Legos, start rummaging and I am quickly overwhelmed. 

How do you go about sorting your legos. I will be sorting by color since that seems the easiest, but what do you sort them into? Gallon ziplock bags, smaller plastic bins, milk jugs, coffee cans?

Alright, I've been reading some isekai lately, and I can't help it anymore. The clichés, the tropes... I had to write it! 

1. The Overpowered Protagonist

Why bother with character development when your main character can just sneeze and obliterate a mountain? These heroes trip over a rock and unlock god-tier powers. Remember when protagonists had to train, struggle, and maybe—just maybe—face actual challenges?

2. Reincarnated with a Cheat Skill

Ah yes, the classic ""I died and got reborn with an ability that breaks the world's logic."" Whether it's infinite mana, the power to copy any skill, or being a literal dragon, it's like the cosmic powers that be are running a charity for overachievers.

3. The Obligatory Harem

Because what's a fantasy adventure without a gaggle of love interests who exist solely to fawn over the hero? Each one with as much depth as a puddle—there's the tsundere knight, the catgirl, the shy healer, another catgirl.It's like collecting Pokémon but with fewer personality traits.

4. RPG?!

Nothing screams immersive world-building like characters who refer to their lives in terms of levels, stats, and skill trees. ""I can't go to dinner tonight; I need to grind until I reach level 50."" Totally.

5. The Forgotten World

So you got hit by Truck-kun and woke up in a new realm. Do you miss your family? Friends? Nah! Who cares about Mom and Dad when you have magic swords and mythical beasts to play with?

6. The Token Beast Companion

Can't make friends? No problem! Just tame a mythical creature who becomes your loyal sidekick for no apparent reason. Dragon? Check. Phoenix? Check. Overpowered slime blob? Double-check.

7. The Useless Deity or Mysterious Guide

""Greetings, hero! I have brought you to this world but won't explain anything useful. Farewell!"" Thanks for nothing, mysterious goddess who probably won't appear again until it's convenient for the plot.

8. Instant Mastery of Everything

Language barriers? Non-existent. Complex magic systems? Learned overnight. Ancient martial arts? Downloaded like a smartphone app. Our protagonist is a walking, talking Swiss Army knife of skills.

9. One-Dimensional Villains

Because who needs a well-crafted antagonist with motives and backstory when you can have Evil McEvilson who wants to destroy the world because... reasons?

10. The Power of Friendship... Sort Of

Allies who met the hero yesterday are willing to lay down their lives without a second thought. It's amazing how far a shallow conversation and shared battle can go in forging unbreakable bonds.

11. Convenient Plot Armor

Facing impossible odds? Cornered by the big bad? Don't worry! An undiscovered superpower will awaken just in time. Consequences? Never heard of them.

12. Worldbulding? What's that?

Why show when you can tell? Let's have characters explain the world's lore, magic system, and history in monologues longer than a politician's speech.

13. The Magical Academy Setting

Because every overpowered hero needs to attend a school where they can be underestimated by their peers and teachers, only to shock everyone during the entrance exam or first combat trial.

14. The Unnecessary Tournament Arc

Nothing pads a story like a good old tournament arc. It's the perfect place to showcase the hero's abilities, introduce disposable rivals, and avoid advancing the main plot.

15. Cultural Misunderstandings Played for Laughs

""Oops, I used a hand gesture that accidentally proposed marriage!"" Hilarity ensues. It's all fun and games until you realize this joke has been made in about 3,000 other stories.

16. The Suspiciously Modern Fantasy World

Medieval setting but with modern conveniences like baths, cafés, and pastries? Sure! Sanitation systems and advanced architecture with none of the historical context. Why not?

17. Economy?? Anyone??

Gold coins are thrown around like pennies. Buying entire shops with dungeon loot doesn't upset the economy at all. Inflation? What's that?

18. Fan Service Overload!

Armor for female warriors that's less protective than a swimsuit? Bathhouse scenes that add nothing to the plot? Because who needs storyline progression when you can admire half naked catgirls instead?

19. The truck-kun technique 

Always begin with the protagonist meeting an untimely end via an accident. Bonus points if it's a truck. Double bonus if they save someone (usually a child or a cute animal) in the process.

20. The Food Fetish

Have your MC introduce common dishes or spices to the new world, blowing everyone's minds. ""You've never had coffee? Let me revolutionize your cuisine!"" If you know, you know.

Can we get some originality, please? Maybe a plot where female characters have goals beyond swooning over the hero?

We launched on Indiegogo and were fully funded in the first hour, now with 200+ backers! Personally I think this is steller.  While a viral moment or hitting half a million would be amazing, it’s not essential to creating a shipping product—that’s the real goal. Get the product made so I can widen my audience beyond crowdfunding.

For me, having more than 200 people take a leap of faith, pre-ordering something five months from delivery. That’s huge. 

This project has been fully bootstrapped—every step from soldering to filming was done in my basement (except the hero video, that wasn’t my basement but we still did it ourselves). My pre-launch email list converted at around 25%, which seems on par for small campaigns like this (I can expand more on this if anyone wants).

Manufacturing Insights (thus far)
Here’s a quick breakdown for anyone curious or working on hardware:

Tooling Costs: My molds have come in at ~$10K for two plastic parts, a rubber top, and a metal ring. The bottom part is overmolded (two molds for one piece), which adds cost but I believe the extra cost is worth it. The difference is hard to describe, but the soft-touch bottom feels worlds apart from the cheap plastic on typical coffee scales.

Material Costs: Plastics and rubber cost about $5/unit, including overmolding. 

PCB: It’s a big board with 65 RGB LEDs, a high-end ADC, temp sensor, and accelerometer, so costs are higher. This is what is driving up the per unit cost.

Assembly: Still finalizing, but I designed it for efficient assembly. Worst case, I could hand-assemble 20–30 units/day myself if needed. This keeps things flexible.

A note on the funding goal: we could cover the tooling, so the goal was set to produce the first set of units. Not an overall project goal that would cover marketing, tooling, etc etc etc. this is pretty typical.

One big advantage for me is having a friend in China (we went to school together) who can facilitate smaller production runs. Without that, the usual factory MOQs (minimum order quantities) could have been a deal-breaker. I think tooling and MOQ is where most crowdfunding projects fall apart and fail to ship.

While we have one more stop in the morning (the Northern Norway Art Museum) I can already say it’s been a lovely experience. 

Tours: we did two. 
- Brim Explorer hybrid catamaran whale tour
- Greenlander northern lights tour (x8 in a small vehicle)

Both were excellently organised and safely run for humans, and Brim went out of their way to explain and demonstrate the code for whale watching. 

We got **so** lucky with the aurora; local conditions haven’t been good lately for it but we only drove past Kvaløya. We not only got decent iPhone pics, our guide took stunning photos of the lights too. 

Tromsø itself was quite charming although it is clear it may struggle with the peak tourism seasons.

The public buses are excellent. We used them exclusively as well as walking most places around town. 

A few things I hoped to do but decided not to, because I hate travel stress and rushing around between activities with a 70-yo relative who can’t safely rush and really only wants to see the lights made it not worth it:
- Feeding reindeer 
- Sauna
- Walk to and explore around Telegrafbukta

We ended up not going to dinner on our final night; we originally wanted to book at Emma’s for the tasting menu. 

But we were actually too tired and wanted to enjoy being cosy and have a relaxed and organised morning departure. We had terrific lunches at Bardus and Skirri which felt good enough and like we had gotten what we wanted from experiencing some local food. 

Perspektivet’s exhibit about Finnish prefab housing was very enjoyable and interesting. 

The Polarmuseet was… so, I greatly enjoyed the actual historical content, but I found the presentation a bit dated and creepy, and the paper guides not so easy to follow along with. The queering polar history exhibit, however, was super interesting. And although the taxidermy was quite off putting in some ways, much of it was also quite beautifully done and the artefacts showed the evolution of the polar industries. 

The view from atop the Fjellheisen cable car was worth it. If you love big sky, I say do it. It’s an easy ride up and down so it’s minimal effort for terrific pictures. Who cares if everyone else has the same ones. Taking in the view is pretty amazing. 

Overall I feel we got a lucky break weather wise - dry, a couple crystal clear days, cold for us but not intolerably cold to stop us doing planned activities - great meals and a nice balance of pootling around sight seeing and guided tours. All fuelled by delicious coffee and treats from local cafes.

Husband and I have been together 15 years. We have two kids under 3 years old together. 

Husband (Tyler) and girl (Kat) are coworkers from an old teaching job. They would see each other once a week in a psych hospital to teach students. They met in 2023. 
Feb 2023 I noticed a text from Kat but there previous convo was deleted and it just said “yay, ok!” I confronted him and asked why he deleted the texts. He kept lying and lying saying he didn’t delete it then finally said he delete it cause he didn’t want me overthinking (I have a history of being jealous and at this time I was pregnant with our second so super hormonal). 
Anyways, he tells me he won’t delete anymore texts from her. 
They stopped working together cause she moved to a different job but came up with the idea to go into business together with another friend in March 2023. 
I noticed her texts were always asking to hang out even right after I gave birth to our baby she was texting him asking if they could meet up so he could help her with her job. 
She would always send him photos of the beach or whatever she’s doing like walking or stuff and said stuff like “wish you were here” when she was back at their old worksite. 
She was overly friendly and he didn’t stop it. 
They never hung out one on one other than one time where he said she needed help for her job. They were supposed to meet at a coffee shop but it was Labor Day weekend and they ended up walking on the beach since the coffee shop on the strand was busy. 
I noticed he would be having long phone convo with her like 1-2 hrs after 8pm. But he would take them outside. 
I told him I wasn’t comfortable with this or if it was about business why doesn’t he just take them inside? So it stopped. 
Then something happened where they needed to go to a business meeting 1 hr away and she asked to carpool. So they did. 

I don’t know why but I really just didn’t feel comfortable with their relationship and I’ve been honest with him about it. So he told me he would be honest with me and keep things professional only with her. 
But now yesterday I find out that she was at an event at his new work place where they had an opening for the practice. I asked him if she was there and he lied and lied and said no.
Then he got mad that I knew and said he has to lie because I make him feel like he has to lie. 
Now he wants to divorce me saying he has not done anything wrong but I make him feel like he did. 

I don’t understand though because this is someone I’ve told him I don’t feel comfortable with and I still allowed them to go into business together and he promised me he’d be honest with me but still lies to this day. Am I the wrong one? 

Edit to add: I’m 99% sure he has not cheated because he has not hung out with her one on one in a private area more than that beach time. I have his location. He also works from home 4/5 days of the week. The 5th day he’s on a psych campus so there’s no way he could cheat there. On the weekends we are always together with our kids.

So, on Saturday night, I brewed a peppermint pinwheel pod, poured it into my mason jar, and put it in the fridge to chill overnight. The next day, I realized I’d forgotten to make ice (classic), so I left the jar in the fridge and instead brewed an almond croissant pod to drink hot.

Later that evening, around 8 PM, I needed to tackle a ton of studying. I grabbed my peppermint pinwheel coffee, added some ice I’d finally remembered to make, poured in 1/2 a cup of Almond Breeze milk, and sweetened it with a packet of Sweet’N Low. The peppermint flavor was intense—not syrup-level intense, but noticeably more visible.

Curious, I brewed another peppermint pinwheel pod to try the next day, but when I drank it, the flavor wasn’t nearly as strong. but now I’m wondering if “marinating” yesterday's coffee for 22 hours had something to do with it. But I also used 1/2 a cup of Oatly Barista, which might have overpowered or masked the peppermint entirely. Or maybe I’m just crazy!

I’d love to test this theory again, but here’s the problem: I’m not a hot coffee drinker and I only have one mason jar 💔. If anyone out there has more jars and pods, please try it out and let me know if you notice a difference!",3,1732225246.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False

1gwr1uj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gwr1uj/aita_for_wanting_to_go_on_the_vacation_i/,AITA for wanting to go on the vacation I requested off for 4 months ago?,"[TLDR at the bottom]

Basically, I (19F) work at a chain coffee shop that is stationed inside a chain grocery, but all that really matters is that I answer to the singular manager of the coffee shop section. I started working here just before the summer, if that matters at all. 

Every year during Thanksgiving, my family takes a small 2 or 3 day vacation every year, which is multiple hours and states away. When I found out the dates for the vacation back during the summer, I put them into our request-off booklet, which includes the date I asked off for and the fact that I would be out of town. 

My store has holiday blackout days where we basically aren’t able to request off— which is reasonable, the store will still be open, right? The office people who are in charge of the store itself have a paper both in the clock room and in the coffee shop with the dates for the blackout days. Both posted papers had dates that would not interfere with my vacation (which is two days before and including the day of Thanksgiving itself), and I thought I was off the hook. None of the days messed with my vacation and I checked multiple times throughout the past 4 months, just in case the papers changed for any reason and I could then go back home and tell my parents and we could make adjustments and whatnot. 

Well, today my manager (I’ll call her Lena) texted me with a new set of blackout days (picture of the paper and all), saying that nobody can be off on an entirely NEW set of dates that did not align with the paper posted by the corporate store in both aforementioned locations. Now I’m panicking because I’ll be multiple hours away! My family bought tickets to some dinner-and-show events that are non-refundable and time locked!

A quick side note— the managers (mainly the top 2) of the chain store I work at are also notoriously bad at their jobs, and have had multiple complaints filed against them to corporate over the years.

For some more context, my manager is straight up crazy difficult. Lena like to leave the counter to go smoke/vape outside for half an hour and return later, or frequently leaves to take super long non-work related phone calls. Lena also has a habit of leaving her shift two hours early. As the manager, Lena is supposed to work at least two closing shifts a week, or a closing and a mid— no big deal, right? Well, she sometimes makes the schedule, but she will always make switches to make sure that her hours and requested off days are priority, no matter how early other people requested off for.

She is also frequently super late to things, like her shifts. Once, she was over 30 minutes late to a meeting that she had called! She ignored her phone and texts messages from all the other staff, which is crazy especially when she called for the meeting about how terrible we all are (she had the audacity to mention tardiness). Not to mention Lena’s general volatility and inappropriate workplace discussion among coworkers. Examples of this include telling coworkers how good her… sexual exploits were the previous night, boasting about her cheating with a married partner, and other such inappropriate workplace conversations. Her volatility includes being quick to anger over the slightest inconvenience and shouting when anything doesn’t go her way (for example, if something is wrong in her personal life, she is sure to bring it to work and make it everybody’s problem, resulting in poor cleanup and even poorer mental states of the other coworkers).

She also once exploded on me over the phone when she demanded I show up to work on a day off (I commute to my college campus multiple hours away, so the regularly scheduled “day off” was really to go to school), and when I told her I couldn’t, she told ME to tell the assistant manager (let’s call her Sara) that Sara should come into work in my stead. Sara had requested off weeks ago to go to an event multiple hours away. Lena had not worked that day, and was doing nothing but sitting at home.

We’ve also just recently had a bit of a mass exodus from the kiosk, the reasoning being Lena’s continued attitude towards workers and her general unprofessionalism and unwillingness to do her job (with too many examples to list). One person quit, and three others (including Sara) have put in their two weeks in the past week or so. I’ve also been thinking about looking for another job, but with finals right around the corner I’ve been trying to focus on studying and not Lena breathing down my back. 

Now, I’m dreading trying to tell her that I will by physically unable to show up to work on the blackout days that have cropped up a week before the holiday. So, Am I The Asshole for wanting to go on my vacation? How can I handle this professionally? Any advice I could get would be super appreciated. I’m posting this on the 21st, with the vacation coming up in just under a week.

TLDR: My workplace posted brand new blackout days scheduled during my vacation that was requested off 4 months ago (scheduled around “old” dates, apparently), and my manager is aggressive and unlikely to budge. AITA for wanting to go?

He says ""ah but is he cuter than me?"" I'm thrown that a) *I'm not available* wasn't clear enough and that b) he wants to go there. Shocked, I reply ""sorry?"" He repeats the question ""is he cuter than me?"". This is a terribly awkward, lose-lose question to ask so I responded ""I'm very fond of him"".

He then said ""I bet he's white"". Noticing the racial undertones of that statement, I try to diffuse the tension with a joke ""yeah he's the palest mofo ever"" \[also true, my bf and I are both gingers\].

He than goes on to say ""yeah I heard people round here are racist"" and I reply with ""oh yeah there's definitely racists in SA. Guess it depends who you talk to"". He replies ""so you admit it, you're racist?"". I responded with ""I would hold racial biases but I've read a few books about it and I'd like to think that helps"". He asks (accuses) ""so what you think since you've read a couple books it makes you not racist?"". I explain, ""no, I'm actively admitting I'm racist. I grew up in a colonialist system that's racist. I have unconcious racial biases. I have benefit from the racist system I grew up in. I recognise that privilege. I try to be aware and educated about racism but I would still have biases and I definitely still benefit from being a white woman in a colonialist country."" I think he was surprised I actually

1. admitted to being racist without getting defensive and
2. could articulate systematic oppression. He then said ""You're alright, your boyfriend's a lucky man"" I said ""thanks."" The ""thanks "" was not because I wanted to and not because I meant it but because I needed this conversation to be over. I had so much adrenaline and anxiety flowing through my body because of how aggressive and confrontational this guy had been. I left immediately and called my friend to vent. I was so rattled.

As a POC woman I cant believe how many of you idiots are defending her. She literally admits to being racist yet you guys are defending her. Honestly if you have unconscious racial biases work on them, try to see POC as human beings. You have anxiety, try being a POC in a system laced with white privilege. Try going out and constantly being reminded that your skin color will always be second best. Next time a POC does aprroach you, if you are so lucky try to reject them not with the mindset of a privileged white woman but with the mindest that this is a person who probably has to struggle to gain the privileges that you people enjoy on a day to day basis. Unfortunately I dont think you wold understand this because you have a way of invalidating our experiences. But honestly this is pathetic. Just my 2 cents as a proud african american woman. And to the POC who did approach her, well done for being brave but you are better off sticking to your race. They will never understand your struggles or understand how to treat a POC without condescension.",1,1732224579.0,u_Big_Pause5662,0,1.0,False

TLDR: I’ve never traveled on a GTC before and this training/TDY came together last minute. I got up booked by a government run in on base at a rate higher than what is approved rate on DTS. What are the consequences for me? 

More context/back story:

First hotel: government run Inn at military/gov rate, no issues. 

Second hotel: it’s a long training 100+ days, so I asked if there was non availability so I could get a non A letter and get off post. I was told no, so with my understanding I needed to stay there. When I booked over the phone I asked and confirmed the reservation for the approved dates and made sure to ask for it at the government/military rate, same process as before. When I checked in I gave a copy of my orders and no issues, confirmed that I was getting the gov/mil rate, no taxes etc.

It just came to my attention when looking at a receipt for the room and the rate on the room is higher than the approved nightly rate in DTS, by like $7. I think they upgraded my room, without my knowledge. It’s not like I have a jacuzzi tub or a kitchen, or anything remotely lavish or over the top. I only noticed a difference in my room and a peers when I visited their room and realized I had a different coffee maker, a cabinet over the microwave instead of a shelf and second chair. 

First time using a GTC as a military member, and feel like a moron for not getting after this harder after hearing horror stories from other service members. 

“How screwed am I?” Am I going to be on the hook for the $7 over the approved rate for 100+ nights ($700+ difference between voucher approved rate and actual cost). And/Or is this something like a negative counseling statement/revoked government travel card/ or even worse consequences? 

Just trying to figure out a proactive course of action before I submit these receipts on DTS, what blowback to expect from DTS/Military and to try handle this at before blowing this up as a bigger issue.

A week ago my BF and I were eating some pastries for breakfast. He asks if I could make them at home, I said how it would be kinda complicated but I could find a recipe online and try it out. 

Then he starts saying how he can only cook a few things like eggs and sausages and would never be able to make these pastries. 

My reply was ""You can read a recipe."" and I said this with no malice, I think this was a normal thing to say, part of a conversation. Well then he just got up and left to go vape outside. He comes back in and just goes crazy. 

Imagine me sitting there happily drinking coffee and eating pastry, he starts saying all this stuff. And IDK if you can imagine the HATE in this guys voice. It was like this. 

""I don't like the way you talk to me.""

""Don't tell me what I'm capable of.""

""Don't tell me what I can or can't do."" 

""I have a 6 figure job and a masters degree. What do YOU have?? What have YOU done??""

I was just shocked, I told him I wasn't calling him stupid, I said if he doesn't know how to make something he can read a recipe?? I didn't say he's too stupid to read a recipe?? I wasn't even specifically talking about him, if you don't know how to make something then ""you can read a recipe"" seems like a normal thing to say?? 

I don't have a job right now and I also don't have a degree. I've always had good jobs but I have been unemployed since June. I have 100k savings and I still pay my share of everything. Now it's like he thinks I'm some loser who achieves nothing? 

I keep repeating his words in my head ""What do YOU have, what do YOU do?!"" I can't explain the hate and disgust that was in his voice when he said this to me. I feel like he really hates me. 

I ended up leaving the house for the day just to get away. He bought flowers to apologize which he has never done before. 

**His text said ""I don't want to hear an evaluation whether I am smart or not. I know what I am, based on my education, high skills, my capabilities, engineering occupation, contribution to the economy, 6 figure income, and many more facts and achievements of mine. So please don't say such things to me. Be nice and kind and respectful.""**

Often my BF says to me that something is logical, or obvious, or tell me I lack comprehension.  Now after this outburst, it seems very clear he thinks I'm stupid. I honestly want to leave, it might be my final straw with him. Imagine a nice sunday morning destroyed by this tirade. And somehow it's still comes back to being my fault, because I said this thing that offended him and I should have just not said it..

If I take her back would that be a mistake?,"I once had 4 very close friends. We grew up in the same neighborhood, and went to the same schools through college. We were very close, we did everything together. That was until I met my ex-girlfriend in college, let’s call her Kate.

I loved Kate, I was sure I was going to marry her. But those plans got blown to hell when Kate and one of my best friends Derek sat me down together and told me that they had developed feelings for each other. They hadn’t planned it they said, it just happened. They told me how sorry they both were and hoped that I could forgive them and we could all still be friends.

To say I lost it is an understatement. If Kate wasn’t there things would have gotten physical. Then, to make matters worse all of my other friend’s took Derek’s side. They told me that Derek and Kate never did anything physical before telling me and they can’t help how they feel. So I should just get over it, be a good friend and accept their relationship. I again lost it. 

So in the span of a weekend I lost the girl I loved and virtually all of my friends. It was a really dark time. 

The relationship between Kate and Derek lasted only three months which didn’t surprise me one bit. Derek is good looking, outgoing and a lot of fun. He’s always had a way with women but never stayed in a relationship very long. He’s the type of guy that’s always right no matter what and is actually pretty full of himself. I knew Kate and knew that wasn’t going to work for her and I was right. 

Almost immediately after things ended with Derek, Kate calls me crying about the horrible mistake she made. She begged me to give her another chance and I coldly told her to go to hell.  My ex friends also called to apologize and I gave them the same response. I blocked every one of them and four years later I still haven’t spoken a word to any one of my former friends.

Last month however Kate contacted me through my LinkedIn and ask if I would unblock her. I never stopped loving Kate, even after four years I still had feelings for her. So I relented and we started texting. It was just small talk and catching up at first. Then I agreed to meet her for coffee one day and that’s when she told me how much she missed me. She tells me that she was never happier than when she was with me and no guys she’s dated since has come close. She has been sick over what happened for years. Kate told me that she was just young and stupid and didn’t realize what she had.

I left that day telling her that I had to think things over. And I’m still thinking. Since I no longer have any close friends I’m limited in people to go to for advice. So here I am on reddit. Would I be crazy to give things with Kate another shot? ",0,1732223993.0,relationship_advice,27,0.25,False

I work maybe 10 hours a week at my job, this has been going on for 3 months or so, and some may envy that schedule, but I am so bored. It, unfortunately, has trickled into a lack of overall motivation and happiness. I go to bed feeling unfulfilled. 

Instead of just being lazy all day, I work on online courses in coding, linear algebra, and economics. However, even when I complete those things the feeling is still meh. 

I have an active social life so I don't feel too lonely. I go to the gym, play tennis and bartend on the weekends.

· was she really playing games? 

· should i honestly tell her i felt overwhelmed the whole time?

· should i tell her i think shes been playing me for attention?

there was a girl (f,20) whom i (m,23) didnt pay any attention to in my polish speaking course. 
later when i sat eating at a food stand next to uni, a guy sat down right at the next table and she also sat there, turning out to be her colleague.

i just said ""hey, arent u in my polish course?"" and she said yes. we had a bit of small talk and she told me her native language, which i knew 2 sentences in. 
i didnt think and casually just said the extremely direct and naughty sentence which only we both could understand.
which made here blush and laugh at the same time, having difficulty holding her drink in. 
the 2 guys didnt understand so it was a bit of an inside joke. 
i went on with my day.

next lesson time she just sat herself next to me in polish course, and she was extremely nice and supportive while we were doing the exercises together. 
when i was walking in hallway with her, she subtly asked my about my number and i just gave her my phone with my contact open. (she closed the contact and scrolled the contact list saying it wasnt mine, which i found weird)
later on she followed me when i was leaving uni and , and i casually just dropped id like to grab some food. so she was super helpful to show me the streets (since im not often at uni) were we could eat streetfood and without any backthought i bought us waffles and payed for hers as well. 
she even accompanied me to the tram station.
i gave her a hug for goodbye and took my tram and didnt think anything. 

i realized she told mw stuff about herself, but didnt ask many deep questions about me (which i find odd?), so my gutfeeling told me shes all in for attention games.

i called her in evening to humourously ask her whats wrong with her since shes suspiciously nice to me, and wether shes a fed.
we both laughed, but i had a bad gutfeeling. 
she texted all week, she even double texted multiple times, because... well i really hate texting. i intentionally took hours to reply.

the day before next lesson she showed me she was making waffles via imessage. and i told her to bring me some tommorow.
next lesson. 
before next lesson i was about to grab a coffee and saw her smoking a cigarette with some guy from her lectures and didnt thunk much about it... until he and his friend just entered our small-class and sat there asking the teacher if it is okay.
shw again sat next to me, even gave me the waffles she made for me.
but i noticed she was heavily shaky and excited. 
anyways she left the class with me, and we smoked a cigarette before driving by bus together. 
i felt extremely overwhelmed being around her, like id have something to prove for her to like me, and was lowkey just wishing i could do my lectures without any games.

i felt like shes probably one of those girls that try to get you hooked for attention, so i texted her how im not sure if'd work out for whatever random reason (i said im tryna seek god or whatever) and she should go sit with these new guys instead, (who obviously werent coming to the course)
she obviously paniced waiting for my response. and clarified that these guys are just from her lectures and came to troll the teacher, but wont ever come again etc. 
and from then on she heavily tried to qualify to me by how she low key is into that god stuff as well. So i said we could go pray together sometime.

From then on she didnt text me anymore the whole week up till the next lesson where she didnt even greeted me and sat back at her place totally ignoring me. 
i found that super inconsistent.
to make a cut, before the next lesson i just told her im gonna focus on lectures and realized i dont have space for women rn, so id delete her number respectfully, but how since shes super kind i'd wish her all the best for the future. 
her response thanking me for my honesty and then 10minutes later how im stupid for being the one that gave hope, despite knowing id focus on uni. the tone of that message was relatively flat, and it didnt seem like shed care about anything but making me look like i was the one chasing. kinda immature.


why do women do that half-invested stuff?
i felt heavily ambushed by a girl overinvesting into me and then inconsistently ghosting me in lectures. almost like lovebombing.
now i have a hard time focussing since im diabetic and the emotional stress knocked me out for a week. ",1,1732223819.0,Adulting,1,1.0,False
1gwqjhy,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_lele9397/comments/1gwqjhy/zakuraki_credit_to_max/,Zakuraki (credit to MaX)," Tw there is some violence in this story and some trauma. 




Do you know how most stories start off with ""once apon a time""? Well, this one doesn't start like that.

Instead im just going to say: if your a serious empath, get lost. Okay! With that out of the way!

This is the story of my life! My names zakura hoshino. I am one of the most wanted criminal in the world, and you might be thinking"" zakura, what the worst You could do in the normal world.

Well, I got news for you. My realty isn't the same as yours. Instead, we have super villains and super heroes. My super power happens to be death. So im unable to die, and anyone I look at I can kill if I choose to.  

Just  to add a little lore to my world I’ll tell you one little bit of info. That’s it. When every multi cell organism turns 15 they gain a “super power” some are curses and others are blessings. I got a curse. To others it would be a blessing because they could help people by joining the army but it just makes my life a living hell. 


Chaos ensues

 Me being unable to die makes it  difficult but the main part is that I had no idea what my power was when I first got it. So I ended up killing my classmates. And because the government is made up of a bunch of absolute sticklers and apparently killing people is “illegal” in their book. 

So I had to run. I ran. And ran. And ran. My name spread like a wildfire in a dry forrest. And my entire world was up in flames. My future.  my reputation. Everything kicked in the gut and thrown into the dumpster. 
 

Run. Run. Run. 

I escaped like a vampire out of the morning sun into a cave hiding from society. And that brings you up to date. But that was 3 years ago. And now We’re here I’ll explain why I ran and what events unfolded the day I got my power later. But I’m busy right now. I throw a knife in the direction of a cop that’s been hunting me down for the past 3 months. He ducks under it. I throw another and it hits him square in his arm. He winces slightly and mutters to himself(or what I had heard) “that selfish brat” i disappear into the “shadows” (a door) with a smug grin on my face.  

I’ve decided to give the cop a nickname. Gary. His new name is Gary. I retreat back to my small cave to find my younger sister just sitting there eating a bowl of cereal. I sit besides her. She takes out one of her earbuds and looks at me. 
“ that was fast zak” 
I nod “You just wake up?” 
“Yeah” she responds. 
I look her dead on the eyes and see the eye bags under them. 
“Sakura. When did you get to bed last night.” I know that she has insomnia but it’s still concerning. Like I have it to. But hers is even worse. 
She looks at the ceiling and thinks for a moment. 
“Around 3? I think that is”
“ am or pm”
She stares at the floor nervously. 
“Sakura I know that you struggle to sleep but you’re hurting yourself.”
She sighs. “I know zak and I’m sorry. I had bought a new book yesterday and I got distracted and read it last night”
I stare her dead in the eyes “ Sakura. SLEEP”. She falls down to the floor pretending to sleep and I chuckle. 
She’s always known how to make me smile. Anytime. Any day. I sit down next to her and set my knife on the table to clean and sharpen. I take a rag out from under the table and wipe the blood off my blade with one foul swipe. I look at her and hand her around 50 dollars. “Money from another job?” “Yeah” she takes the money and shoves into her pocket wallet. I nod approvingly and smile softly. 

A few hours go by and the sun sets. And I look beside me to find her laying on the ground asleep. I close my book and turn off the lamp. I pick her up and put her in her make shift bed. I lay down near her with a knife in hand for protection. The night ends and daybreak falls.  Sakura sits above me and smacks me awake. I sit up slightly started. “ Sakura! What was that for!” She laughs “you weren’t waking up! I had to take drastic measures!” I sigh and I stand up. “Alright fine. You got me there.” I grab my coffee cup off of the simple plastic table and pour some water into it. “what do you want for breakfast” she thinks for a moment. “ pancakes?” I sigh. She knows I hate making pancakes but she still loves them. “Sure…” “yay!” I reach into the cabinet and grab flower, sugar, and syrup. I make her pancakes and plop them onto a paper plate and then hand it to her. “This good?” “Yup!” I slump in the seat next to her half asleep and I grab a small bite of pancakes from her plate. “Hey! What was that for!” “ bakers tax” I mutter slightly. “ if a baker gives something to a customer they done have the right to take some of the treat!” I sigh. She got me there. “Fine” she laughs slightly and I slump back into my chair. “Do you remember what Wednesday is zak?” “The day you get your power?” “Yeah! I’m excited!”  I chuckle. “ I bet. Let’s just hope that you don’t get one like mine. Not very fun.” She nods 

The next day comes and Sakura heads out to the market. I lay in my bed for a few hours and later she comes back holding a large bag of fruits, meats, soaps, and from the looks of it, a pack of granola bars. She sets down the bag on the dainty and fragile table. It wobbles “ it looks like that things on its last leg.” I nod. “Yeah. We’ll have to get a new one.   1️⃣When do you want to get another, flower?” I gave her that nickname a few years ago because. Well. Sakura. Sakura flower? You get it. 

She thought for a moment “ how about today?” I shrug. “ I don’t have anything to do today. Let’s go get one then. We have plenty of money. Anything else we might need?” “ I was thinking ‘bout maybe getting a coffee machine. We could heat the water. And also make coffee. Convenient right?” I nod slightly. “Alright. Then it’s settled. Ready to head out?” “Yup!” “ onwards!” She follows me into a store. She’s wearing a simple outfit and I’m wearing a black hoodie. I look like your stereotypical emo teen. It’s been a few years since the “ incident” so I can still go outside. But I have to be careful. I let Sakura pick out a table and I pick out the coffee machine and some coffee grounds. “ ready to head out when you are” she says”then let’s check out and leave” she nods and we buy our items and head out. As I’m setting up the new table Sakura speaks” so! What do you think my power will be?” “Hopefully something compleatly different from mine.” I chuckle slightly. “ I might get the opposite from you. Like life! Yeah!” “Well you could always dream.” I finish setting up the table and I flop onto my makeshift bed. Sakura joins me laying on hers. 

The night falls and dawn rises. Sakura sits up and pokes me “ zak wake up…” from her voice she sounds pretty groggy. I sit up and my hair is a mess. I rub my eyes and I look at her. And the words: who are you? Slip out of my mouth. “ what do you mean? I’m Sakura? Your sister?” “You look… different” “huh?” “ your hair is white. And you have a halo? I think” she stands up and walks over to the “bathroom” and looks in the mirror pinching her hair in between her fingers as if she’s checking if she’s awake or not. “ your right! My hairs white!” She looks at one of our plants that’s wilting dramatically and it regains its color and posture. “Woah!” She lights up as if she’s a toddler getting a puppy for the first time. I chuckle slightly. “ your is probably like mine. But when your happy it works and when your upset or mad it doesn’t work at all” she nods.” Don’t I have to go register my power in the dawn bank?” “ I don’t think we should” “why not?” “ they think we’re dead” “ah. Yeahhh that would be a reason”. 

Close parent
“ I wonder where dad is” Sakura randomly blurts out. “ same. He said he’d be back a few days ago.” “ you think he was killed? I mean the parents of the people you had killed a few years ago might be trying to get back at you.” “Yeah.  That’s a possibility. Let’s hope he’s still alive though.” She nods. “Also zak, do ya want to go for a stroll in the park?” She smiles softly. “ sure” we exit the “house” and start walking towards the park. A tall and lanky man starts walking towards us and Sakura runs over to him and hugs him. “Dad! Your alive!! Yay!” My father chuckles softly. “ yup. But I have to get something before I can go back with you. Sorry” “ no! You’re fine!”

After a few minutes of chatting with our father he heads out and me and Sakura head back to the cave. They hear a loud and echoing shriek. Sakura flips her head around almost falling over. “Dad!” She begins to run towards the loud yell screaming “ dad! Dad! Are you okay!!” Tears streaming down her face as she runs over to her father lying on the ground covered in blood. His own blood.  While Sakura is sprinting towards her wounded father she gets sniped from afar. I run out of the cave and I throw a knife at the sniper who shot both of them falling to my knees tears streaming down my face. “no, No, No!,NO!! SAKURA! DAD!” I take sakuras hand in mine. It’s cold and lifeless. I shake Sakura trying to wake her up “ Sakura!please! Wake up!”

Different parts of the city, at different times of day. She's just everywhere. I’ll be riding the tram and notice her walking down the street. I'll be waiting for a bus and notice her in a coffee shop. People tend to see other people around a city I get it, but there's no one else I can think of that I've seen multiple times in this way and it just feels off.

I didn't really clock it as strange until she started carrying the same exact bag as me. It’s a Carhartt canvas tote bag, same color, same style. It's just odd. We’ve never made eye contact. She’s around my age, but we don’t look alike. She’s just there, always around, never noticing me. I am really interested in the spiritual significance of this.

1gwqebi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Interstitialcystitis/comments/1gwqebi/gabapentin_and_incontinence/,Gabapentin and Incontinence?,"I'm 26, have been diagnosed with IC for over 6 years, I started having symptoms after a series of recurrent UTIs after I started college. My mother also has IC. I also have peripheral neuropathy (Dx by skin biopsy, but the underlying cause is yet to be determined). I have been taking gabapentin since 2020 and currently take 1,800 - 2,400 mg per day (3 or 4-600 mg tablets). 

My IC issues had always been limited to discomfort, pain, painful urination, and urgency, and are well correlated with the typical IC triggers, like too much coffee/tea/soda/juice/alcohol and/or not enough water. But over the past couple of years the urgency has increased and I have been dealing with mild incontinence issues too. It comes and goes, but I literally keep a pair of clean underwear in my bag/car/work desk. 

This week at work I was speaking with someone who has complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) about pain management, getting into palliative care, and the hysteria around opioids that has lead to the severe under-treatment of her pain. One of the things she mentioned (before I disclosed that I actually take it myself) was how willing doctors are to prescribe gabapentin to people with her condition despite the risks associated with it. She mentioned how other CRPS patients she knows (she knows a lot in person but also online in support groups) have ended up with incontinence issues from it after being on it for long periods of time and that it's not something that is often appropriately considered as a risk when it is prescribed. This was part of the convo we were having about the potentially exaggerated risks of opioids in pain management relative to both other meds for pain and to the harms of under-treatment of main.

I told her that I actually take it and take 1800-2400 mg, and have since 2020, and she apologized and said she felt bad for going on and on about a med I actually take myself, but I told her I appreciated her mentioning it because I had never heard of that before; it's not in the list of common side effects. I told her that I wanted to look into it more because I had actually been experiencing that myself but had been assuming was a symptom of my IC, so I am really glad she mentioned it.

This is all to say: does anyone else 1) take gabapentin for another condition that they 2) started taking after already having an IC dx (where you had a baseline of IC symptoms that you can compare things to)? 

If so, how long have you been on gabapentin for? Have you developed any incontinence issues that you did not have before?

Gabapentin is the only thing that I've found that works to manage my neuropathic pain, so I really don't want to get off of it. I don't know what else I could even take (I've tried Lyrica (didn't help) and Cymbalta (turned out I can't take because I also take Zoloft) and too much THC makes me dissociative so med. marijuana isn't an option).

Unfortunately, I've run into a problem with one of the last cafés on my list. 

I had some extra time yesterday, so I decided to use the opportunity to finally make the trip to the School of Pharmacy to try the coffee at their café. However, when I went into the building, I was immediately stopped by a security guard who, after finding out that I was not a Pharmacy student, told me to get out. Defeated, I settled for the nearby Balzac's instead to get my coffee for the day (which ended up being considerably better than anything I've had on campus, so overall yesterday wasn't a total loss).

However, I am now more determined than ever to get coffee from the Pharmacy building. What could they by hiding from the other programs?? Do they secretly have the best coffee in the whole university, or are they just gatekeeping mid?? I need to know and will not rest until I find out.

My thoughts: if you like patchouli, this is absolutely your house. It's not mine, but there are the occasional gourmands that I just have a need to know. While this listing is up, she is taking requests for holiday/winter blends in the facebook group. I'm happy to post requests there if you're not on FB - just let me know. Here's what I've tried from this listing -

* 1984: Not bad - I love the opening but there's something that goes sour and sharp in the dry down that made me have to go scrub this off. Sigh.
* Cherry Fluff: this is syrupy maraschino cherry that toes the artificial cherry line in the dry down on me. I'm glad to have it? mostly for layering purposes.
* Drink Me: I love me a nice fizzy soda scent and this is a nice red cream soda scent.
* Stardust: space/galaxy themed? I had to try it. I like it even, despite my complaints about her vanillas.",5,1732223100.0,Indiemakeupandmore,1,1.0,False

Nothing is booked yet except for our flight to Munich, but we expect to have two and a half weeks to spend in Europe before flying home to the United States.

What we're trying to decide now is where to go! We're pretty sure we want to spend four nights in Munich and visit Salzburg, and we're leaning strongly toward Vienna for a few days after that. But we don't know how many days we want in Vienna, whether we want to do Bratislava as a day trip from Vienna or spend a night there, and whether we have time to really do justice to more than one of Prague, Kraków, or Budapest after that. I think we're leaning slightly toward Kraków for one. If we go to Kraków, and if the war is over by then, I'm also interested in visiting Lviv, if we have the time and means to do so. But really, we are undecided.

I like beer and trains, she likes coffee and theater, we both like food, art, history, architecture, and museums. We're not planning to rent a car, so we'll be relying on the railways and possibly buses and/or ferries to get around.

258lbs 
5'7""
Asthma 
ADHD
Autism
Albinism 

This has happened to me since I was a teenager. 

I've always been a frequent urinator. But sometimes it gets bad and I have to pee like every two minutes. Kind of literally. 

Most ppl who know me know that I pee a lot. 

Im always told it's a diabetes symptom but every time they run labs, they say Im not diabetic. 

So I get these days where for a few hours I'll have to pee a lot, and the urethra hurts. Sometimes white discharge comes out of the pee head, but not every time. 

It's usually accompanied by prostate pressure so i assume it's possibly related. But sometimes the prostate discomfort doesn't seem to be there. 

When I've noticed it happen: 
Like I said, it's been happening on and off since I was a teenager. 

I've attributed it to two things 
1. When I drink a lot of liquid in a day. Or when I drink a diuretic like coffee and not enough water. 

Sometimes, it will happen if I have a large smoothie as well. It actually is more frequent when I make smoothies. 

2. When I have blue balls. I noticed this when I had my first boyfriend and I was horny all the time, giving me blue balls. Which in turn gave me the same burning pee sensation, and the frequent urination. 

I've tried asking doctors about it, but doctors seem to never think of it as an issue. 

In my last blood test, my A1C was 5.2 and my glucose was at 100. 

I've been asking doctors about this issue for years and never get much more than them saying ""your last blood panel was fine so I don't think it's diabetes"" and then thats it. 

When I Google this, it usually says an STI but that's unlikely bc it happened when I was a virgin, and me and my fiancé don't have penetrative sex much cuz it's a hassle for gay men. We've also gotten multiple STI tests and we're always negative for everything. 

I always try to explain this to others but they never understand what I'm talking about. 

It does also happen to my fiance and he said it happened before we met to him too and it was usually when he was dehydrated, or if he was edging a lot. 

It also happens to me frequently when I drink alcohol ",2,1732222355.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I guess I'm not 100% sure colors I should stick with to keep the dining room and living room from being completely out of whack and ways to bring some color/life into the space, I don't want it to be too muted. I do rent but I have free reign to do pretty much whatever I want, outside of painting and can't really change anything in the kitchen either so stuck with a bit of brown from the counter next to the dining table.

The couch is a porcelain/cream color \[ [https://www.livingspaces.com/pdp-basil-125-inch-4-piece-sectional-with-left-arm-facing-chaise-316255?region\_id=949494](https://www.livingspaces.com/pdp-basil-125-inch-4-piece-sectional-with-left-arm-facing-chaise-316255?region_id=949494) \],

I don't think I can get a rug under the dining table, due to the limiting size of the space I feel like it'd be too much.

So, I do need to get an entertainment center for the TV, the brown cabinet behind the dining table I'm leaning towards replacing with just a nicer cabinet or side table, probably not a china cabinet but maybe something with storage for coffee and teas, the coffee machine on it on the left is too big for the kitchen so figured I'd keep that like a coffee area. Above that there was a mirror so I'll probably put another mirror up there again.

Any other ideas of other things to do / look into getting to help bring the room together and liven it up a bit Was thinking maybe another mirror somewhere in the living room, maybe by the front door, a little bench/stool by the door to sit down when putting shoes, something nicer for the orchids I have by the window for a start?

Hi, looking for ideas for my boyfriend who buys everything he wants/needs, so I need to think of something he doesn't even know he wants 😁
Budget 70€
Some facts about him:
- works in IT, but does not necessarily love it, however one day he would line to take up trying to program games
- obv, loves video games, but does not really like anything related to gaming setups (like chairs or lighting). If you know of anything coming out soon that the gaming community is reeeally excited about - that would be cool! 
- same for board games, but I always buy him that :(
- plays the guitar and piano and has the complete gearlist of every rock musician ever memorized - but I don't know anything about this
- likes reading, but has kindle 
- likes anything specialty - coffee, tea, beer, anything - but also got him this for last present
- loves nature and camping but has pretty much everything, and what he does not have he either does not know about or is really expensive
- just bought a ton of new clothes. Does not really like fancy brands or wear any kind of jewelry. 
Sentimental gifts are ok, but i have a sentimental gift planned for anniversary soon.

# ROUND 1

**Dave:** *""Brad, you’re up first. What’s your first pick?""*

**Brad:** *""Alright, with the first overall pick, I’m taking the refrigerator. It’s the MVP of appliances. It keeps my beer cold, my leftovers edible, and my ice cream… well, it prevents it from becoming soup.""*

**Phil:** *""Bold. Going straight for the foundation of the team. Respect.""*

**Laura:** *""Wow, Brad. Real visionary pick. Can’t wait to see you draft ‘running water’ next.""*

**Dave:** *""Laura’s already chirping, and we’re not even through round one. Phil, you’re on the clock.""*

**Phil:** *""I’m going with the microwave. It’s fast, efficient, and it never judges me for heating up leftover pizza for breakfast.""*

**Mike:** *""You know the microwave judges you. Every loud ‘beep’ is basically saying, ‘Are you sure about this?’""*

**Phil:** *""That’s just how it shows love.""*

**Dave:** *""Solid pick. Mike, your turn.""*

**Mike:** *""Alright, I’m drafting the washing machine. It’s big, it’s reliable, and honestly, I’d be a mess—literally—without it.""*

**Laura:** *""Bold of you to assume you’d even use it. You give ‘laundry pile’ energy.""*

**Mike:** *""Rude, but not inaccurate.""*

**Dave:** *""Laura, wrap up round one for us.""*

**Laura:** *""Easy. I’m taking the dishwasher. I’ve done enough handwashing in my life. Let the machine suffer now.""*

**Dave:** *""And that’s round one! Recap: Brad’s rocking the fridge, Phil’s nuking leftovers, Mike’s got the spin cycle, and Laura’s letting the dishwasher do her dirty work.""*

# ROUND 2

**Dave:** *""Laura, you’re up again.""*

**Laura:** *""I’m going with the stand mixer. Not only does it help with baking, but it’s also heavy enough to use as a self-defense weapon if needed.""*

**Mike:** *""That’s… concerningly practical. Do you live in a bakery or an action movie?""*

**Phil:** *""Laura’s team is shaping up to be equal parts domestic and terrifying. Love it.""*

**Mike:** *""Alright, my second pick is the vacuum cleaner. It’s the only thing that can keep up with my ability to drop crumbs everywhere.""*

**Laura:** *""I hope you’re drafting an operator for it too.""*

**Phil:** *""I’m taking the coffee maker. It’s small but mighty, and it powers my entire existence.""*

**Brad:** *""Good choice, but you do realize it doesn’t come with a barista, right?""*

**Phil:** *""I’ll manage. My ‘team spirit’ will grind the beans.""*

**Brad:** *""For my pick, I’m going with the air fryer. It’s basically the LeBron James of quick meals—makes everything better, faster, and crispier.""*

# ROUND 3

**Dave:** *""Brad kicks off round three.""*

**Brad:** *""I’m adding the grill to my team. Indoor, outdoor, doesn’t matter. It’s the ultimate flex for burgers, steaks, and veggies if you’re feeling fancy.""*

**Phil:** *""A grill? Do you also draft ‘fire’ next?""*

**Brad:** *""Jealousy is a bad look, Phil.""*

**Phil:** *""Alright, I’m going with the blender. Smoothies, sauces, margaritas—it’s the Swiss Army knife of the kitchen.""*

**Mike:** *""Solid choice. Although let’s be real: 90% of blenders just make a smoothie once and then sit in the cabinet for five years.""*

**Phil:** *""That’s still more use than your vacuum will get.""*

**Mike:** *""Touché. My pick is the toaster oven. It’s like a microwave and an oven had a baby, and it’s perfect for my snack-heavy lifestyle.""*

**Laura:** *""The toaster oven? Are you drafting appliances or creating a dorm room?""*

**Dave:** *""Laura, what’s your pick?""*

**Laura:** *""I’m going with the Instant Pot. It’s like a slow cooker, a pressure cooker, and a miracle worker rolled into one.""*

**Mike:** *""Laura’s team is starting to look like she actually knows what she’s doing. Unfair advantage.""*

# ROUND 4

**Dave:** *""Laura, you’re up again.""*

**Laura:** *""I’m taking the robot vacuum. Not because I need it, but because I want to watch it get stuck on my rug and question its life choices.""*

**Phil:** *""So you’re drafting entertainment now. Nice.""*

**Mike:** *""I’ll take the deep fryer. Is it healthy? No. Do I care? Also no.""*

**Laura:** *""Great. Your team is just going to be a smoky kitchen by round five.""*

**Phil:** *""I’m drafting the ice maker. It’s underrated, but when you need it, it’s clutch.""*

**Brad:** *""Phil drafting the ice maker is like drafting a kicker in fantasy football—nobody else wanted it, dude.""*

**Phil:** *""Say that when you’re drinking lukewarm soda.""*

**Brad:** *""Fine. I’m taking the bread maker. Fresh bread, no effort. Game changer.""*

# ROUND 5

**Dave:** *""Final round! Brad, make it count.""*

**Brad:** *""I’m going old school with the iron. Crisp shirts, no wrinkles—it’s all about looking sharp.""*

**Phil:** *""You? Ironing? I’ll believe it when I see it.""*

**Phil:** *""I’m drafting the electric kettle. Fast tea, fast coffee, fast ramen. It’s versatile.""*

**Mike:** *""I’m taking the air purifier. It’s like a bouncer for your lungs—keeps the bad stuff out.""*

**Laura:** *""I’ll round it out with the food processor. Anything that chops onions so I don’t cry is a win for me.""*

**Dave:** *""And that’s the draft! Final rosters: Brad’s got the fridge, air fryer, grill, bread maker, and iron. Phil’s team has the microwave, coffee maker, blender, ice maker, and electric kettle. Mike’s rocking the washing machine, vacuum, toaster oven, deep fryer, and air purifier. And Laura’s squad includes the dishwasher, stand mixer, Instant Pot, robot vacuum, and food processor.""*

**Laura:** *""So, basically, I win.""*

**Phil:** *""We’ll let the listeners decide, but… yeah, probably.""*

**Dave:** *""Listeners, let us know whose team you’d pick! And join us next week when we fantasy draft… condiments. Until then, stay drafty!""*

He got very upset and would say he's going to get a 60 pounder and get drunk than he would constantly knock on my door like the cops till I ended up calling the cops on him for him to leave me alone.  3 months down the road again we started talking just as friends. Well he told me he's on Facebook dating now looking for men. Long story short he's planning on meeting these guys for one night stands. I found out he doesn't use condoms and doesn't care if he catches HIV or anything else. I feel sick to my stomach that I even ended up seeing this guy and what could've happened to me if we had sex. Now I feel scared and want to move out of my building because of him. I'm scared if one day we start talking again and have sex and I catch HIV. What should I do just completely ignore him ? What would you do in this situation?

Hello! So I’m Canadian and used to make what I now know is coffee milk for years. The only coffee syrup in Canada (Java Syrup from Nestle) was discontinued a year ago and I’ve been struggling to find a replacement. 

On top of that I’ve had to go sugar free for health reasons so most of the standard syrup recommendations are a no go. 

Right now I’m making do with essentially iced lattes with a bunch of sweetener but I also don’t like having that much caffeine and syrups generally don’t have much in them. 

Does anyone know a good sugar free coffee syrup that I could order? Or have any other recommendations?

I’m working on a project to support smallholder farmers, empower women, and protect bees through sustainable beekeeping and tree planting.

So far, we’ve:

* Installed 35 hives
* Planted 706 bee forage trees
* Supported a women’s group with funds to start a tree and coffee nursery
* Engaged 150 farmers and 50 students

It’s been amazing to see the impact made so far. One of the farmers - Jane, who just got a hive donated is excited to produce honey to support her family and plant more trees.

All beehives and trees will be labelled with your name, and you will have the ability to track and monitor them. This will make a wonderful gift for your loved ones.

We’re making progress, but there’s still a long way to go. If you can, please consider donating or sharing our campaign. Every little bit helps us grow!

I guess I'm not 100% sure colors I should stick with to keep the dining room and living room from being completely out of whack and ways to bring some color/life into the space, I don't want it to be too muted. I do rent but I have free reign to do pretty much whatever I want, outside of painting and can't really change anything in the kitchen either so stuck with a bit of brown from the counter next to the dining table. The sheets on the couch in the picture were just temporary.

The floors are light gray & walls are white.

The couch is a porcelain/cream color \[ [https://www.livingspaces.com/pdp-basil-125-inch-4-piece-sectional-with-left-arm-facing-chaise-316255?region\_id=949494](https://www.livingspaces.com/pdp-basil-125-inch-4-piece-sectional-with-left-arm-facing-chaise-316255?region_id=949494) \],

I don't think I can get a rug under the dining table, due to the limiting size of the space I feel like it'd be too much.

So, I do need to get an entertainment center for the TV, the brown cabinet behind the dining table I'm leaning towards replacing with just a nicer cabinet or side table, probably not a china cabinet but maybe something with storage for coffee and teas, the coffee machine on it on the left is too big for the kitchen so figured I'd keep that like a coffee area. Above that there was a mirror so I'll probably put another mirror up there again.

Yeah, so guess I'm

Any other ideas of other things to do / look into getting to help bring the room together and liven it up a bit Was thinking maybe another mirror somewhere in the living room, maybe by the front door, a little bench/stool by the door to sit down when putting shoes, something nicer for the orchids I have by the window for a start?

&nbsp;

The room was buzzing with the low hum of mingled conversations, the clinking of glasses, and the subtle shifting of bodies as people navigated the space. From the looks of things, the Delta Society threw one hell of an event, but all Tim could focus on was her. Across the room, closer to the main stage, Mar’i stared back at Tim. Here she was, embedded among the Delta Society’s ranks, despite having tried to dissuade Tim from coming earlier today.

Before he could confront her, a voice cut through the murmuring crowd, bringing the room to a focused silence.

“Thank you for coming, everyone. Let’s get the evening started properly,” the host announced, stepping into the light. He introduced himself as Henry, a man in his mid-thirties with an earnest demeanour that seemed slightly out of place. Tim studied him from a distance, noting the subtle signs of nervousness that betrayed Henry as an underboss; someone with a superior to impress.

Henry’s voice carried well in the room. “We welcome back all our members, and I invite them to give a hearty hello to all the new faces among us today.”

On cue, the majority of those in attendance replied in unison, ""Hello!"" The sound was chilling, almost cult-like. Tim’s gaze darted back to Mar’i, who joined in the greeting, her voice mingling with the others. So, she was already a member.

“This event is about giving new people a chance to get to know the Delta Society, and giving us a chance to get to know them back,” Henry continued, his tone enthusiastic yet measured. Tim listened, understanding now that this was some kind of mass informal interview, a gatekeeping process to learn more about potential inductees before formally welcoming them.

As Henry wrapped up his speech, looking at his laptop on a small table beside him for prompting, Tim discreetly pulled out his cellphone, flicked a switch, and slipped it back into his pocket. Nothing too conspicuous.

The crowd soon dispersed back into smaller groups, the murmur of conversation blossoming anew. Seeing his chance, Tim approached Mar’i, who was conversing with a group of attendees. His smile was calculated as he greeted her, forcing her to maintain her cover by reciprocating the friendly facade.

“Hey you!” the former Robin chirped. “Can we talk? Come on, just over here!” Tim suggested, nodding toward a quieter corner of the room. She followed, her expression schooled into one of casual interest.

Once out of earshot, Tim’s friendly mask dropped. “Mar’i, make this make sense. Why tell me to stay away if you’re neck-deep in their operations?”

Mar’i’s response was quick, her words rushed. “I infiltrated the Delta Society two months ago, Tim. Just after the pod crash, after they tried storming Cadmus to get a look at its passenger. We need to know their plans before they escalate further.”

Tim crossed his arms, his jaw tightening. “That’s exactly why I came tonight. Why did you think you had to do this alone?”

“What about you, Tim? Do the others know you’re here? Or do you always play by your own rules?” she shot back, her voice a harsh whisper.

He grimaced. “No, they don’t.” Tim frowned. “But at least I didn’t lie to them. Why didn’t you tell us about this?”

Mar’i’s anger flared. “Are we really doing this?” she hissed, glancing around to ensure no one was listening. “I know you’ve been struggling with *The Mar’i Problem*. It’s hard to run a background check on someone from a non-existent reality, isn’t it?”

Tim felt a twinge of guilt, mixed with offence. “I trust you because you’re my teammate, Mar’i.”

“Oh yeah?” Mar’i replied sharply. “Like Uncle Bruce trusted his? With all those contingencies?”

She softened slightly. “Look… I didn’t want to give you any reason to doubt me, Tim. I know you wouldn’t have accused me of anything right away if I’d have told you, but I couldn’t risk… sowing any seeds of mistrust.”

He sighed, the weight of their situation settling between them. “I can feel plenty taking root now.”

“You don’t mean that,” Mar’i replied softly.

“No, I don’t,” he admitted. “But I’m hurt you think I’d be that untrusting of you. If I want to know something about you, I’ll ask. Okay?”

She nodded, the tension between them easing into a fragile understanding.

Suddenly, Tim’s phone beeped. He pulled it out and his brow furrowed.

“What?” Mar’i asked.

“While we were arguing, I’ve been pulling data from Henry’s laptop. His security’s not totally incompetent, so a lot of the files are corrupted or encrypted.” Tim paused, squinting at his phone. “Let’s see. Video files for his latest *debunkings*. Oh!”

“What is it?” Mar’i asked, her interest piqued.

“Looks like he’s writing a book.” Tim rolled his eyes. “*The Tenants: Earth Delta’s Squatter Problem and How to Solve It.*”

“Anything *useful*?”

“Not sure. There’s a set of unlabeled coordinates from a text chain. It looks like the Delta Society’s running surveillance on an apartment building here in Chicago.” 

Mar’i’s interest was piqued. “Go check them out. I’ll hang back for another 20, to avoid suspicion and keep my cover.”

Tim nodded. “Okay.”

As he turned to leave, Mar’i’s hand on his arm stopped him. “Tim,” she said, “Just... don’t do this alone, okay? Take the others.”

“I will,” he promised.

From their vantage point, the Titans surveyed the dilapidated apartment complex that sprawled at the city's edge. It stood as a stark reminder of urban neglect, its walls stained with the passage of unkind years.

They stood atop a taller building a few whole blocks away, with Tim equipped with high-tech binoculars, scanning the building from the coordinates meticulously. Beside him, Bart's curiosity broke the silence. “So, Tim, what’s the laptop gossip? Does this place have a secret underground cave or what?”

“It was marked as high priority, a place to watch,” Tim responded without shifting his gaze from the lenses.

“So that’s why we’re being so careful then, right? Standing so far back? Because they might have their own people already watching this place?” asked Conner.

Tim smirked. ""Ding ding ding.""

“Why didn’t you just say so?” Conner retorted, scanning the area with his X-ray and telescopic vision. “Nothing out of the ordinary. Just people getting on with their lives,” he reported back moments later.

Raven interjected, her voice low and even, “The Delta Society doesn’t do us the favor of dressing up in bright costumes. It could be anyone.”

Bart leaned in, his voice appropriately quick. “Wait, wait, wait - what’s the big deal if they see us? Not like Tim left a business card on the laptop or something.”

Tim was quick to explain, “I’m not in a rush to have the Titans make headlines for swooping in on some guy’s apartment.”

Bart didn’t seem concerned. “Surely, worst case, we wave and say ‘Sorry, wrong address!’, right?”

“It’s not just about us,” Raven interjected. “If we bulldoze into a Delta Society operation, they could use it as ammo against us in another broadcast hijack, or online. Through us, they’d be getting more attention from the media, and attention could lead to escalation.”

Their strategic exchange was interrupted by a new voice. “Sorry I’m late.” Mar’i approached, her anxiety almost palpable to Raven’s sensitive perceptions. Fearful, no doubt, for the team’s reaction to her deceit.

Bart was unbothered as he replied, “Don’t worry. You didn’t miss much.”

Mar'i caught up quickly, glancing towards Conner. “Do you have eyes on what’s inside?”

“Just some guy,” Conner replied succinctly. “Tim pointed us at the exact apartment from the coordinates, and… nothing.”

“Well…” Mar’i continued. “If we’re worried about a front-page moment, there's always another way to approach this.”

Ding dong. The sound echoed faintly in the rundown apartment building’s dimly lit stoop. The five stood there, inconspicuous in civilian clothes. Mar'i, with a determined frown, pressed the buzzer again. No response came from within. With a slight crease of impatience between her brows, she pressed it a third time. After a brief silence, a crackly voice emanated from the PA box.

*“Go away. I don’t want trouble.”*

Raven stepped forward, her instinct to reassure, but Mar'i's voice cut through first, firm yet gentle. “We don’t either. But we’re worried someone else is watching you. Someone dangerous.”

After a tense pause, the door buzzed open.

Ascending three flights of narrow, creaking stairs, the group reached a poorly lit corridor. As they approached the designated apartment, a young man with curly dark hair peeked out. His expression was sheepish, his posture slightly hunched as if bracing for unwelcome news. “Hi, I’m Jordan. Please, come in.”

As they entered, Raven felt a wave of fear emanating from him - palpable, like a cold draught. Not only that; she recognised him from somewhere. Not that she could place it. Despite this, the apartment was completely ordinary. The apartment smelled faintly of old coffee and damp wood. The living room’s worn sofa sagged slightly in the middle, and a stack of magazines threatened to spill off the modest TV stand. A small kitchenette was visible, its surfaces cluttered with unwashed mugs and a stack of bills.

Jordan, eyeing them nervously, broke the silence. “Who do you think is watching me?”

“The Delta Society,” Tim responded without hesitation.

Jordan’s eyebrows shot up. “The ‘storming Cadmus’ Delta Society?”

“So you heard about that?” Conner’s tone was casual, but his eyes were searching.

""All of Chicago did - and further out, I’m sure,"" Jordan responded.

Raven gently took the lead, her voice soft, meant to comfort and not to confront. “You don’t seem to think it strange that the Delta Society would be keeping tabs on you, or that strangers like us would come around with a warning. I know you’re afraid, but we just want to help.”

A tension in Jordan’s shoulders relaxed; it was as if the stress caused by his unexpected visitors had been lifted, at least somewhat, upon hearing her comforting words. Under her gentle probing, Jordan confessed slowly. “They’ll be after me because I’m Reawakened.”

The group exchanged concerned glances. “How many addresses of Reawakened people might they have?” Conner asked with dread.

Tim was pragmatic. “I’d have to dive deeper into Henry’s files to see what else he’s got.”

But while the others began to grapple at the bigger picture, Raven kept her focus firmly on Jordan, his anxiety still potent. “Can you tell us about your arrival here?”

Jordan shifted uncomfortably. “It was… a lot. It’s hard to explain. Everything I know is… so far away. I’ve just been trying to lead a normal life, fly under the radar, not stick out.”

“Are you used to sticking out?” asked Mar’i, relating a lot to his situation.

He sighed in response. “I guess I am. Enough that I’m a lousy liar.” Jordan shook his head. “It’s not fair! I’ve not been bothering anyone; I’m just trying to disappear, to be normal!”

“It’s not your fault,” Raven replied quickly. “There’s no shame in doing what you need to to survive.”

“Right,” Mar’i agreed. “This is just who the Delta Society are. They fear what they don’t understand, and other realities are far outside of the scope of their tiny minds.”

“They’re not stupid,” Jordan replied. “My mom taught me not to think of people like that.”

Mar’i blustered. “No, I know, but—”

“Are you Reawakened too?” Jordan cut her off. “Only, you speak like you’ve got some experience with these Delta people.”

Mar’i frowned. She looked at Tim, whose eyes had already landed on her, and then back to Jordan. “I’m not, no. But I’m also a long way from home, a long way from my family.”

Jordan scrunched his eyes shut and shook his head. “My parents - they’re probably... I mean, they must be freaking out. I think about it all the time.”

Mar’i nodded, though her eyes flickered with something between empathy and envy - a feeling she quickly buried behind a practised smile. After a moment of heavy silence, Jordan looked up, curiosity breaking through his apprehension. “Who are you all, exactly?”

The five of them just stared at Jordan for a moment then, as they all collectively realised they had prepared no answer for such a question.

Before anyone else could respond, Bart blurted out, “Well, seeing as we know your big Reawakened secret, I figure you rat on us and we rat on you: we’re the Titans.”

The room tensed at Bart’s words, Jordan most among them all. His reaction was immediate; his face drained of colour, his eyes widened in fear. “The Titans?” he stammered, his voice cracking. The room suddenly felt smaller, his anxiety palpable in the cramped space. Not just to him, but to Raven too, who was suddenly overwhelmed by his all-encompassing anxiety. He stood, his movements jerky and nervous. “Well, I think... I think it’s best if you leave now. I wouldn’t want to keep you heroes busy.”

His voice was apologetic, his demeanor frantic as he edged towards the door, urging them towards it without touching anyone. ""I’m really sorry, I just... can’t,"" Jordan continued, his words tumbling out in a rush. His hands fluttered at his sides, a visible struggle to maintain composure.

They obliged quietly, stepping out into the hallway as the door shut behind them.

Beat.

“What was that all about?” Bart asked. 

Before Raven could process her thoughts, Conner’s concern redirected their focus. “Raven, did you recognise him from somewhere? Like he was someone you’ve seen before?”

With a hesitant nod, she confirmed, sensing Conner felt the same way. “Y-Yes. Yes, I did,” she stammered through the secondhand effects of Jordan’s fight-or-flight.

Conner cursed and moved back towards the door. Tim tried to intervene, but it was too late; Conner had already knocked the door off its hinges.

Mar’i exclaimed in a mix of shock and protectiveness for Jordan, “Conner, what the hell are you doing?”

They stared into the now-open apartment, only to find it empty, the window left ajar.

“He’s like me,” Conner concluded gravely. “He’s one of the Reawakened clones, from Cadmus.”

So I think the date-planning sort of falls onto me. I'm also really bad at flirting or initiating a kiss 😭 Does anyone have advice for a Saturday night 2nd date? I was thinking maybe some kind of activity, but I honestly have no idea. And WHEN is it appropriate to initiate a kiss?? 

Any advice is appreciated 😭 I'm so nervous but I really want to see her again. Thanks yall 🫶

I quickly got an automation working to turn on light with motion trigger that tuns back off after no motion.  There was an easy blueprint for that.  Works incredibly fast.  So much faster than the same in Apple HomeKit!  Amazing.  

But, now I want to figure this revert to previous thing.  Can I inquire about power, brightness, saturation, color and everything prior to a change and then recall that data and use it to revert to previous?  

For this specific case, I am using an Aqara motion detector and a Hue color light strip.  I have Aqara M2 hub integrated via Matter to bring all that gear in.  I’m using the Hue bridge integration to bring in Hue.

Pretty new to HA.  Just got it running last week.  We’ve got a pretty extensive investment in Hue, Aqara and Apple gear.  Always been HomeKit centric, but feeling the restrictions!  

Appreciate advice for getting this revert to previous state thing working.

I asked out a masc presenting lesbian at a coffee shop and we decided to go out that next week. As we talked we had so much in common and they seemed super mature and kind. They seemed to prioritize being kind to others and improving. They were also vegetarian and I’m vegan so that was really refreshing and awesome. 

They mentioned that they were nonbinary but, still a lesbian. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with this but, I’m afraid I will never understand them fully. 

They explained that gender is a social construct and can be changed. While I think this is true, I don’t think that doesn’t mean that construct isn’t important to everyone. One of the main reasons I’m a lesbian is because I love the gender of a woman specifically and the culture that surrounds them. I personally think of gender in a binary way but, that doesn’t mean I don’t respect people who think differently than I do. I want to coexist with these people and love them for who they are with our different perspectives. 

Time is a social construct but, for most people it’s important and significant. For me, binary gender and especially how lesbians treat each other because of their shared experiences is emotionally significant for me. 

I feel like a lot of lesbians (especially the ones I’m attracted to aka mascs) tend to have this same view. What can I do? 

I feel lonely with this view. I wish I could change but, it’s something that I’ve recognized about myself",1,1732221155.0,lgbt,6,1.0,False
1gwpi54,https://www.reddit.com/r/NomadStories/comments/1gwpi54/the_edge_of_empty/,The Edge of Empty,"The engine coughed—a tired, guttural sound that mirrored how I felt. I gripped the wheel tighter, leaning forward as if it would coax the van into giving me just one more mile. The gas gauge was so far below empty I was sure it was running on sheer determination. Max shifted beside me, his ears flicking back, and I glanced at him.

""Just a little further,"" I mumbled, not knowing if I was talking to him, the van, or myself.

Finally, a town came into view, small but alive. The van lurched as I coasted down the main road, and when I saw the gas station, it felt like a mirage. A rusty old sign squeaked in the faint breeze, the faded letters spelling out ""Service & Go."" I don't think they've replaced a thing in this gas station since before I was born, but I didn't care. I managed to pull into a parking spot and turn off the van before it was completely out of gas. I made sure to pick a spot at the top of the little incline in case I had to roll to the gas pump.

""Well, Max,"" I said while patting his head. ""We made it. Kind of.""

I opened the door, hopped out, and stretched. The heat was dry, not unbearable, but enough to make me want a breeze to come through. Max hopped out after me, with very little grace as he hit the pavement. He sniffed the air. I took a quick look around. It appeared like we were on the corner of what might be the main street. I put my hand above my eyes to block out the sun. I think I could see the other side of this little town. The Town Comes Into Focus

The town was small but charming. The buildings all looked older than me with very little done to them. But there were some cute little things done along the street. Little potted plants lined the street. Red bows hung from the lampposts. As I looked around, something else struck my eye. The sidewalks and streets looked like they've just been cleaned. While beaten up due to the weather, there wasn't a speck of trash lying anywhere. The more I looked, the more fond I became of the little town. Next, I noticed the businesses.

A small diner with a hand-painted sign out front. It said ""Deb's Eats"" and underneath it said ""Best Pie in Town"". Next to it, a hardware store with a door that looked run down from years of opening it. Further down the road a bit was a bookstore or maybe it was a thrift shop. It was hard to see with the sun in my eyes.

The street was wide enough for two lanes of traffic and cars to be parked on both sides, but there wasn't a car in sight. It was so quiet it made me think the town was holding its breath. A few locals were walking down the street, so that gave me hope it wasn't a ghost town. I noticed a couple of older men sitting outside the diner too. Everyone moved slow. It was a pace that suggested they weren't in a hurry to be anywhere, which was quite different from the high speed of the city where I grew up.

Max, now leashed up, pulled me toward a patch of grass near the gas station. ""Alright, we can stretch our legs,"" I said. He led us down the street towards the middle of town. It was a charming little town, but the gas station behind me reminded me of why I couldn't linger too long. I needed gas, and I needed a way to get it. A Walk Through the Town

As we started walking, we passed the diner. I caught a whiff of freshly cooked bacon and a pot of coffee brewing. My stomach was rumbling in response. I hadn't eaten since I found Max, but food was a luxury I couldn't afford right now.

The hardware store looked like it had air conditioning, so I stepped inside. The air was cooler, and the faint scent of wood and oil was mixing with whatever cleaning solution they'd been using. Since I still had Max on the leash next to me, I didn't want to walk too far in. I wasn't sure if dogs were allowed. An older man glanced up from his book and offered me a polite nod before looking me up and down. I didn't want to linger too long. Without money, I didn't actually have any business being in the store.

But I walked over to the counter and asked the gentleman if there was a dog park or somewhere else I could let Max run around. He told me a few more blocks down there was a park and the dog was welcome anywhere in town. I was terrified to let Max off the leash though considering what had happened last time.

Back outside, I kept walking further towards the center of the town. A small park caught my attention, shaded by a few sprawling trees that looked like they'd been there for decades. Children's laughter echoed faintly as a group of kids played on a swing set, their voices carrying a strange mix of joy and freedom that tugged at something deep in my chest.

A bulletin board stood near the park's entrance, weathered but still standing. Flyers and notices were tacked on in a chaotic collage—lost pets, yard sales, community events. One brightly colored paper stood out, catching my eye as the sunlight hit it just right.

""Work for cash,"" it read, in bold letters. My heart quickened. Could this be the answer I needed?

I stepped closer, my fingers brushing the edges of the paper as I leaned in to read the details. And just as I began to take it in, someone stepped up beside me. A hand reached out, pulling the flyer down for a better look.

I (28NB) moved into my apartment complex in January of 2020 (great timing) with my (now ex)best friend at the time. It was our first apartment, and neither of us were really sure of what to do, but we found a place and signed a lease and it's been my home for the last 4 years. She moved out early, so for a while it was just me, and I briefly had a roommate. At some point in the last 2 years my boyfriend (30) moved in and lived with me for just about a year or so. We started planning to move closer to both of our jobs last year, and last November when it was time to renew, we were presented with the same 2 options as we had been the last 3 years: Full term year long lease at $1030 or Month to Month at $1230. We elected for month to month, hoping to move by March of this year. We signed the paperwork online, got confirmation, etc, and heard nothing else for a while. 

This is how I think I might have fucked up and why. My boyfriend had lost his job about a month or so prior to signing the lease due to an incredible misunderstanding with his employer, and we knew paying the extra $200/month was a risk, but felt that moving would've been the best outcome and thus worth it. The small town I live in is about an hour and a half from his parent's house and all of his friends, basically his whole life. He had no hope of finding a job close to us due to his degree and settled for a job an hour away, then moved back in with his parents. We have only seen each other on weekends, when he isn't traveling, for the last year, and I work most weekends, so this has been stressful for us and bad for my mental health. However, because he lost his job in mid-October, I was paying for just about everything by myself (rent, food, etc) and trying to work overtime during the Holiday season (I work for a coffee chain). The cutoff date was the 30th, so on the 26th I sat down and logged into the portal to take care of renewing the lease. The options presented to me were: Year long, month to month, or notice to vacate. I clicked on month to month, and I don't really remember anything except clicking the sign button when prompted. I knew the year long lease called for a 60 day notice to vacate, or pay 2 months rent to move out early. I vaguely remember asking one of the property managers (we've had 3 since I moved in) about month to month and for some reason 'you pay the extra 200 a month to give 30 days notice instead of 60' was firmly implanted in my brain. This is relevant (sort of). So basically I didn't really read the lease, just signed shit and submitted it. My boyfriend's dad is a lawyer and he had worked in his office for a while so I guess I assumed he'd read it and tell me if something was weird. I do have ADHD and can be straight up stupid, so at the time I didn't consider that him not having a job was as stressful for him as it was for me, and later found out he also did not read the month to month lease terms, etc. 

This is where I think my property manager is trying to screw me over. The newest property manager took over in January of this year. I heard nothing from her until mid-February, when I get a text saying ""After reviewing your account once you go month to month you should have been paying market plus $200 and I noticed that you're paying your old rental rate plus $200 and we have a couple different things we can do here and that's sign a (year long) lease that would total $1245 or up your month to month which would bring it closer to $1450. Let me know."" This is almost verbatim, I just fixed some spelling and grammar issues. I texted back expressing my confusion over why the amount she was suggesting wasn't reflected or amended at the time of signing my lease up until now and that I'd need to talk to my boyfriend about it (as he had also signed the same lease). After I talked to him, I logged into my resident portal and clicked on my digital lease to go over the terms like I originally should have. And the only thing I found was the addendums. I thought 'this is weird' and texted my landlord to ask for a copy of my lease. She said I could find it in the portal. I said it's not there, can you give me a copy. And then she says ""I would love to but I'm only showing addendums as well which is really weird."" I said yeah that is weird and told her I wouldn't feel comfortable making a decision until I had a copy of my lease, so to send me one asap. She said that she would have to give me a 30 day notice before she changed my rent either way. I heard nothing else, and quite honestly forgot about it by May. 

Boyfriend got a job in early January or so, and by October we finally felt comfortable moving. I wanted to be out by December. We toured and applied for a new place, and were approved on Halloween. The next morning I submitted my one month notice and sighed a breath of relief. And then 3 days later, on the 4th, I get a text that ""Regardless of if you're in a lease agreement or month to month, you still need to give 60 days notice or pay 2 months rent. Which would you like to do?"" I specifically asked ""May I have a copy of my signed lease from this year for reference?"" She proceeds to send me a copy of my lease from last year with the 'early termination clause/fee' (something like that) highlighted. I say ""I appreciate that you highlighted the relevant conditions for me, but that lease is from last year and expired back in December. Can I have a copy of my lease from this year?"" She then says ""You're on holdover, which still requires a 60 day notice."" I'm like 'what is holdover??' so I look it up. And I'm confused as hell because it implies that you've just extended your lease. But we signed a new lease, so how is that possible? I found the confirmation e-mail from the 27th that says 'your lease is finalized! log into the portal to check it out'. So I ask her. ""Holdover... you're saying I don't have an active lease?"" and she just replies ""Regardless of if you have an active lease or on holdover, you still must give 60 days notice."" I stop replying at that point because I'm freaking out. I'm going to have to pay 2 months rent for 2 months, which feels incredibly unmanageable for us at the moment. I feel like I'm going insane, so I dig up every piece of relevant info I can and send it to boyfriend's dad. He's looking it over and for now we're just taking the L because what else can we do. I can't prove I signed a lease, but I have the addendums that I signed from that same night. But if the terms of my previous lease ended, and I don't have an active lease, wouldn't I be subject to state law instead? 

TLDR: landlord tries to change my rental rate as 'lease was written out wrong' or something, and then when I try to move 9 months later, tells me I don't have a lease at all.

After work, I (24 M) went to this local cafe quite often the last few months and started talking to the waitress (36 F) there. At first it was just casual and I thought she was just doing her job being friendly, chatting me up and so on. As I came more regularly we talked more and more and at a certain point I realized we got along quite well. Truth be told I wasn't just coming for the coffee anymore, but still talking myself out of it most of the time.

However the last few days she worked there I somehow worked up the courage to hand her my phone, not saying anything, just the number field open. To my surprise she actually gave me her number.

Until now we've met up 2 times, just going to local pubs to drink and to get to know each other. It never got weird in any way, it was just hours of natural conversation and fun. I can't remember the last time I smiled this much.

At the end of the second evening she drove me to my car, but we were both reluctant to leave just yet. After talking a bit in her car I took the chance to ask her what all of this was - just friendly meet ups or dates. We never clarified that. At first she was really surprised, maybe because it happened a bit soon, but she said that's a good thing.

She also quickly mentioned our age difference. Now to me that wouldn't be a problem. I have no clue what I want just yet and am pretty sure that that will not change in the next years. Currently I'd just like someone more than a friend to talk to and trust, cuddle up to at night and to wake up to next. Just a girlfriend, basically.

I do realize it's very different for her and she also expressed that. She's also unsure what should happen next. She said we still don't know each other very well and would like some more time to just let things evolve. I then just said I really like where we got so far, and she felt the same. Now she's at a different place doing a different work until late december, we agreed to meet up after she came back.

I'm now stuck a bit overthinking things, if it would make sense or if the age gap is really that problematic. Obviously this will come down to what we both want in the end, but in general I would just like to hear some thoughts.

Just for a bit of context:

I' m just a regular Andy - average looks, maybe decent with the right lighting and clothes - rarely going out for fun or to meet new people. Being more on the introverted side and also not being a very talkative guy in public spaces I just never felt the need to do so. 

For most of my ""adult"" life I was in a relationship until last year. Long story short, we just grew apart, with different goals in our heads which resulted in an unhappy relationship of 7 or 8 years that should have ended at the halfway point to be honest. 

Unrelated but still important, a while back I had my first and probably last One Night Stand. It wasn't bad at all, but it confirmed what I always expected: I would just feel even more empty and pointless the day after. I always thought that quick flings wouldn't be my thing, so I'm just glad I got to confirm that.

I'm happy to give more context or explain in the comments.

Thank you for reading all of my rambling.

During that time we'd broken up and gotten back together more than a dew times, and each time agreed to stay friends but would find ourselves taking it further than friendship anytime we met up. It sucked because each time, he would start pulling away and when I'd ask him about it, he would admit the distance was getting to him and would remind him how far apart we were and it made him shut down.

We did talk about moving closer to each other btw, this wasn't a ""no plans to move"" situation, but it would be at least another year for either of us, and nothing was set in stone yet because of our jobs. However, he finally admitted that it was too hard to see each other so little and the last conversation we had we agreed to stop seeing each other completely and went no contact. It was really disappointing and hurtful but I eventually got past it.

Well, just a few weeks ago, I finally ended up making that move. I started at a new job and new city and was checking out one of the coffee shops yesterday in this new place, when lo and behold, of all people I would see, I saw him. I was in a rush to meet with a friend, and so didn't get to talk for very long, but after the initial shock, found out that he'd moved here a little over a month ago. He asked of course if we could catch up and talk, and I've texted him a couple of times, and he has brought up trying a relationship again, but I'm having reservations right now.

It's just that during our LDR. I always felt like I was putting in the work, and he would start pulling away and then we'd break it off, become friends, and the next time we talked it would become flirty and there we went back into the cycle. I just felt like we'd start off strong, but then he would stop putting in effort while I kept trying, and then he would chalk it up to the distance. I know the distance sucked. Every one on this sub can attest to that. But effort from both sides is important, I believe.

And that's what I'm worried about. Was it really the distance? Or him just not trying enough? I'm at war with myself here, because I can see why I fell for him in the first place and would like to see where it takes us, but another part of me keeps reminding myself about all the push-pulling he would do and wonder if I'd only be opening myself up to heartbreak once again. Has anyone been through something similar? Or just any advice at all lol?",1,1732220813.0,LongDistance,1,1.0,False

Like even the sugar free drinks??,"I’m new to Dutch bros, and I became interested because I found out they had tons of sugarfree flavors. Then tried one- and they don’t only have a big variety but their SF flavors actually taste good and not like artificial sugar haha. 

But then I looked at the nutritional info and it’s still so high! Is it because of the milk/cream they use? Or are their SF flavors not actually zero/low cal? I usually sub for nondairy milk anyway so hopefully it’s not the latter. 

But like the medium sugar free golden eagle for example is still 370 cals according to the app. So I’m just confused. There’s no way that’s 370 cals worth of dairy is it?? 

Sorry I know most people don’t go to Dutch bros with the hopes of getting low cal or healthier drinks. But like I said before, so much variety in SF flavors and I want to try them but I was hoping to do so as a low cal option as I’m current dieting. Any info would be appreciated! 😊

Edit: wanted to add, I don’t hope for a zero cal drink. Sorry if the way I explained made it sound that way. Haha. Just wanted a lower cal version. ",6,1732220714.0,dutchbros,19,0.8,False

Royal Night is really smooth, smells great and seems to have decent longevity. It's a little too much like Azzure Aoud though. Sure, there are striking differences, but I guess I was thinking Ombre Nomade was really original. It blows my other powdery rose fragrances out of the water, sure. The oud is much more subtle than Azzure Aoud or Amethyst, but it's still in the same ""fragrance family."" Oh well. Still a great addition. This is my first Woods Collection, and I'm pretty impressed with the quality of the entire product. I think this is the first magnetic cap I have as well. I think I paid $37 as a tester from eBay.

Ajayeb Dubai is a crazy good grab for $18. Not at all 'safe,' but it's sooo interesting. There's a funk in the opening that I just love. I'm hoping it doesn't disappear during masturbation. Speaking of, longevity isn't great. I can still smell six sprays after a couple hours, but it's definitely not projecting the way people describe. (On Fragrantica, someone claimed one spray was almost too much). Hopefully some age will smooth out the rough edges. Definitely smell butterscotch and coffee and the sweetness of pineapple.

His mother’s voice didn’t seem distant, but extremely muddled. Her voice reminded him of how people’s voices sounded when you were underwater.

“*Billy - Billy, baby where are you?*”

Although only five, you could say that Billy was bright for his age. He had only walked twenty or so feet from the campsite, but when he turned around everything seemed different. The trees looked wrong -the bushes misshaped; everything was just *wrong*. The veil that surrounded him now altered the world around him in a way he couldn’t decipher – in a way that *anyone* couldn’t decipher.

Running back the short distance he had traveled from the campsite he could see it was no longer there.

“Mommy?”

Lifting his ear to the sky in an effort to listen for his mother, he was instead startled by a branch snapping behind him. Turning quickly, he stumbled and fell back on his butt. Looking up quickly he investigated the tree line. A thin boy who was at least twice the age of Billy stood under one of the many strange-looking evergreens with a tan dog. The boy stood barefoot and was sporting a well-established “farmer” tan and worn overalls.

“Hello” The thin boy gave a shy grin and waved; the tan dog’s tail wagged and gave his greetings in the form of a friendly bark.

Billy spoke soft and scared, “Hi, I’m lost… can you help me find my mommy?” 

The thin boy walked out of the tree line toward Billy. Not feeling reassured, Billy took a step backward.

“It’s okay.” Said the thin boy, “My name is Steven, and I’m lost too.”

The situation was beginning to be too much for Billy, and he could feel a frog forming in his throat as tears started to well in his eyes.

“I-I didn’t s-see you in the campground before, I-I like your dog. W-where is y-your mom and dad?”

Steven’s face twisted in confusion, “Campground? This is the woods behind my house! And this here dog-” The thin boy hooked a thumb over at the grinning dog, “I found him just a few minutes ago. He wasn’t with anyone, so he must have been lost too. His collar says ‘Calvin’.”

Billy addressed the dog, “H-hi, Calvin.”

Calvin rushed over and showered Billy’s face with wet laps of his pink tongue. The frog in his throat shrank as he wrapped his small arms around the dog and broke into childish giggling laughter.

 “Good boy, Calvin!”, Calvin rolled on his back in agreeance; he was, in fact, a good boy.

Looking up, Billy saw that Steven had closed the distance and was now standing over him.

The thin boy extended an open hand to Billy, “Do you want to team up? I mean, walk together? This place is… weird. I don’t recognize *any* of it, and trust me, I know it all!”

*Stranger danger*, Billy’s dad's voice rang in his mind.

He hesitated for a moment, then pushed away the thought. This wasn’t an old man propositioning Billy to accompany him in his van; Steven was another kid like him, and he was lost too. Grasping his outreached hand, Steven brought him to his feet.

**- two –**

Carol sat alone in the booth of the sparsely populated diner sipping her lukewarm coffee. Headlights poured into the pane glass window to her left. Craning her neck, she squinted in anticipation through the rain-soaked window toward the parked truck. Her ex-husband appeared out of the driver’s side door and slammed it shut.

The two never usually spoke, especially since he re-married, but today was a special occasion – today was their son’s fifth anniversary since he had disappeared.

A bell jingled as the tall, rugged man entered the diner. He scanned around slowly; Carol gave a shy wave as the man finally caught her gaze. Smiling now, he approached the slender woman sitting alone in the booth.

Pilling into the opposite end of the booth, he addressed her, “Hi Care, rough weather outside huh?”

“Nice to see you Phil, we can skip the pleasantries of small talk.” She produced a manilla folder filled with loose paper from her purse, “I actually have something rather important I need to discuss with you.”

Phil sighed, “Right. Well, let me at least get a coffee.” Raising his hand, he flagged down the nearby waitress.

A young girl in her twenties bounced joyfully to the table, grinning widely at Phil.

The waitress spoke in a soft sweet cheerful tone, “The usual Phil?”

“Hey hon’, I’ll just take a black coffee if that’s alright.”

She maintained her beaming smile, “You got it Phil!”

Turning back toward Carol, he could see him staring daggers straight through him.

“What?” he remarked.

“You two close?”

“Care, you know I’m a married man.”

Carol looked toward the waitress walking from the table, making a point of looking directly at her butt before raising her eyebrows.

“Whatever you say.”

“Hey now, don’t bring-”

She cut him off, “I’m not here to lecture you or get in a fight, what I have here is urgent.” She pushed the manilla folder over to him, “Take a look at this.”

Phil opened the folder bundled with loose documents, he now raised an eyebrow at her, “You expect me to read all this?”

“C’mon stop fucking around, I’m serious.”

“Okay, but can you at least fill me on what this is all about.”

“Billy is *what* this is all about.”

He furrowed his eyebrow and shut the folder. Speaking in a low voice he replied, “God dammit Carol, you told me you would stop bringing this shit up. It’s been *five* years.” He slid the folder back to her across the table, “I would still like to keep in touch with you, *especially* on tough days like this, but I can’t keep doing this.”

Carol placed a hand on the folder, “Listen, you don’t have to read this now, but this time it’s *different*. This guy… He thinks he knows what happened-”

Phil smacked the table, “Enough!”

The already quiet diner fell to a silence as patrons looked over at the two. The once joyful waitress hesitantly approached with the coffee.

“I-is everything alright?”

Phil replied, “Yes, sorry hon’ it won’t happen again.”

The young waitress set the coffee in front of Phil, “Well… Wave if you need me.” She gave a quick smile to Carol before hurrying off.

Phil glared at Carol, “We done?”

“No… I…” Carol looked down dejected, “You don’t have to hear it from me, but can you *please* hear this investigator out. I *promise* if you want nothing to do with him, I will leave it be.”

“Five years, Carol.”

She twiddled her thumbs over the manilla folder, “Yes… Yes, I know.” Eyes now beginning to water she looked up at him to meet his eyes, “Please Phil. This is it - I promise.”

A twinge of pity twinged at the annoyed man as he pondered the proposal.

“Fine.” He pointed at the folder, “But I ain’t reading all that.”

A smile broke onto Carols face, “Thank you, Phil. You won’t regret this.”",1,1732220574.0,u_Cal_Tin,0,1.0,False

I'm in a bit of a pickle here trying to decide between the Hibrew H10Plus and the Gaggia Classic Evo Pro. I’ve been poring over specs and reviews, and thought maybe you folks could help me out with some personal insights or experiences.

So here's the lowdown:

Cost-Effectiveness: The Hibrew H10Plus is quite a steal at $400, especially when you compare it to the Gaggia, which hits the wallet at $999. I’m all for investing in quality, but that’s quite the price gap!

Fancy Features: The Hibrew has this pre-infusion feature that's supposed to make the coffee even more delicious, and it’s got a PID for keeping the temperature just right. The Gaggia doesn’t have these, which makes me wonder if I’d miss them.

Build and Extras: Both have a solid 58mm portafilter, but the Hibrew comes with a classy wooden tamper. The Gaggia’s is just basic plastic, which seems a bit underwhelming for its price.

So, what do you think? Would love to hear from anyone who's used these models. Does the Hibrew’s extra features make it the better buy, or is the Gaggia’s simplicity and brand reputation worth the extra cash?

We've experienced a progression from some of the early anaerobic coffees to really unique and innovative processes, yeast inoculation, and now co-fermentation.  The latter have us debating where (or whether) to draw the line.

Does a coffee that tastes like blueberry because it's co-fermented with blueberries somehow diminish the experience of a natural processed coffee that presents blueberry notes? 

Is adding fruit or spices to the fermentation step fundamentally different from adding extrinsic flavors (i.e. flavored syrups) to the brewed cup? 

Could co-fermentation be our best hope for experiencing fun flavors from robusta or hybrid varieties grown in lower elevations?  Would that mean more equitable earning potential across producers?
