My husband's first love had me kidnapped and tortured for ten days and nights.
I could never forget the leather whips lashing my skin, bamboo splinters forced under my nails, steel needles piercing my flesh...
She even killed my first child and my brother!
For all of these, my husband only said, ""She's my bottom line. Everyone must respect Amanda, and you're no exception.""
When he raised a thorn-covered wooden stick at me for her, I knew it should be finished.
Strike by strike.
I was bleeding down there.
Amanda gasped dramatically. ""Did someone... get her pregnant?""
Alexander kicked the coffee table flying. He grabbed my chin, snarling, ""Whose?""
I stared at him and sneered, ""you killed your child by your own.""

Chapter 1
 The day after her brother attended her birthday party, scandalous photos of the heiress in Washington flooded the internet.
 The heiress insisted he was responsible, shattering every bone in his body and throwing him into sea to feed the sharks.
 Sophia Taylor filed charges against the ruthless heiress, but the case vanished. It was controlled by Alexander Ford‚Äîan underworld kingpin.
 And he was her husband for six years.
 ""Sophia, your brother hurt Amanda Williams first. He deserved it. Stop this.""
 Alexander believed Amanda, but Sophia didn't.
 After her brother's funeral, Sophia livestreamed for 99 days in front of his grave. Public outrage forced the court to check the yacht's surveillance footage on that day.
 Alexander locked her in the basement for seven days, so she missed the trial.
 After release, Sophia prepared her third appeal.
 That night, Alexander unearthed her brother's ashes, threatening to burn them unless she signed a settlement agreement.
 He shoved her toward the flames, the urn teetering on its stand.
 ""Sophia, your slander against Amanda's gone too far. Keep pushing, and your brother's remains vanish.""
 He discarded his expensive cigar, fingers brushing her chin tenderly.
 But every word he said cut like a knife, leaving her bleeding inside.
 Sophia stared into his eyes. ""Why? Have you forgotten my brother saved your life?""
 During an international business deal, her brother shielded him from fifty blades, falling into a coma for three years.
 Alexander had spent billions hunting the perpetrators, vowing to destroy anyone harming him.
 Now he snapped, ""Amanda saved my life. Anyone upsets her pays‚Äîyou and your brother included.""
 Blood pooled in Sophia's mouth. She couldn't understand how things had come to this?
 This man had once loved her with all his heart.
 Six years ago, she'd have died in that remote village without him.
 Her parents had died right after she was born. Her brother raised her alone.
 To support her, he quit school for Washington, and became Alexander's bodyguard with his strong figure.
 After taking those stabs, he begged Alexander to fetch his sister.
 In that remote village, Alexander met eighteen-year-old Sophia. The evil responsible for countless atrocious acts was captivated by the pure and beautiful girl.
 He confessed his love instantly.
 But Sophia shrank back, trembling.
 Alexander resolved to bring her home. But just then, the villagers had grabbed knives to stop them.
 Women were rare commodities there. They'd coveted beautiful Sophia, planning to share her before selling her off.
 Two groups fought for a day and night. Alexander had taken thirty knife wounds before he finally fought his way out with Sophia. He'd been on the verge of death, but he still comforted her:""Hush... safe now.""
 That tenderness shattered her defenses.
 They married after his recovery.
 He taught her knives, guns, survival‚Äîtransforming her from a frightened girl into someone calm and graceful.
 Alexander gave her the best care possible. He was never absent whenever something involved Sophia.
 Sophia loved Washington deeply, believing she'd live happily ever after with Alexander and her brother.
 But dreams, however beautiful, are fragile.
 Alexander's cold voice cut through her memories from above.
 ""Stop stalling. Your brother can't afford to wait.""
 Sophia clung to a sliver of hope, thinking Alexander still held some affection for her. ""If I don't sign the settlement, will you really burn my brother's ashes?""
 Dissatisfied with her response, Alexander clicked his tongue impatiently.
 ""Baby, Amanda took a fatal knife for me. I promised I'd be with her for a year.
 Didn't I make that clear?
 She's my bottom line. Everyone must yield to her. Why must you provoke her?""
 Amanda and Alexander grew up together. She chased him for ten years, but he married Sophia in a whirlwind romance. Consumed by hatred, Amanda had Sophia kidnapped and tortured for ten days and nights.
 Sophia could never forget the leather whips lashing her skin, bamboo splinters forced under her nails, steel needles piercing her flesh... Amanda even killed her first child.
 Because of this, Alexander turned against the Williams family and pulled every string to send Amanda to prison for three years.
 Sophia thought Amanda would vanish forever like a nightmare from the remote village. Until a year ago, when Alexander brought her back, declaring before all their buddies: ""For the next year, All of you should respect Amanda. She is the lady of the house.Her authority overrides all.""
 He had completely forgotten how Amanda had bullied her.
 Tearfully, Sophia confronted him, but Alexander was unmoved. ""Loyalty is everything in the underworld. I'm just repaying a debt. Stop making trouble, baby. She won't interfere with you.""
 Sophia fell silent, knowing she had no right to refuse. She waited for Alexander to repay his debt, only to receive news of her brother's death.
 Swallowing her bitterness, she whispered, ""I'll sign. Please spare my brother.""
 Alexander patted her head. ""That's my good girl.""
 He lifted the urn. Sophia sighed in relief, reaching out to take it.
 But in the next second, he flicked his wrist. The ashes scattered into the flames.
 ""No‚Äî!""
 Sophia screamed in despair, lunging madly toward the fire, only to be pinned down by bodyguards.
 Alexander looked down at her with cold contempt. ""You crossed my bottom line, baby. This is your punishment.""
 Eyes red with fury and heart shattered, Sophia glared back.. ""Alexander, I'm leaving you...""
 At that moment, the last trace of love she had for him turned to ash along with her brother's remains.
 Instantly, Alexander's smile vanished, his expression terrifyingly cold. ""Do you think you can escape?
 I implanted a tracker in you. Even if you flee to the ends of the earth, I'll drag you back.""
 ""So behave.""
 Sophia felt chilled to the bone.
 Alexander had implanted the tracker to protect her from being kidnapped by enemies.
 What was once a means to protect her had now become his tool to hurt her without restraint.
 After he left, Sophia sat clutching the ashes until dawn. Then she dialed the number that Alexander didn't monitor.
 ""Jasper Brown, can you help me fake my death to escape?""
 There was no other way to leave Alexander without him knowing.
 It would be better to fake death and escape, then start over with a new identity.
 He answered without hesitation, ""I owe everything to your brother. Even if it costs me my life, I will get you out.""
 Jasper used to be Alexander's most trusted aide. For some reason they fell out, and he went overseas alone to build his own power.
 With his help, success was guaranteed.
 ""But Ms. Taylor, that tracker on you is a tricky problem. I'll need a month to replicate it.""
 As long as she could escape, she could wait a month‚Äîeven a year.
Chapter 2
 Sophia set up a symbolic cemetery for her brother. She bought a bottle of wine and some Lilies to place before the grave.
 It was already evening when she returned home.
 Amanda's laughter pierced the air without warning. ""Alexander, be gentle, you're hurting me~""
 She wore a skimpy halter dress, her chest covered in love bites.
 Alexander pinched her chin, about to kiss her when he spotted Sophia and paused.
 Sophia walked past them without a glance, heading straight upstairs.
 But Alexander's cold voice stopped her: ""Stop! Come here.""
 After a brief hesitation, Sophia obediently walked over. Having spent years in the underworld, Alexander tolerated no disobedience. Not wanting any trouble before her escape, Sophia chose to endure.
 But his next order made her blood run cold: ""Apologize to Amanda!""
 Sophia bit her lip hard until she tasted blood. He demanded she apologize... to her brother's murderer.
 Impossible!
 As Alexander rose in fury, Amanda tugged his sleeve. ""It's alright, Alexander. Don't force Mrs. Ford. I don't blame her.""
 He kissed her lips, and said hoarsely. ""Always so understanding.""
 Then he kissed her deeply, his hand slipping inside her clothes, indifferent to his lawful wife standing witness.
 Even though she had already decided to leave, Sophia's heart still ached.
 She turned toward the stairs, only to be blocked by a maid. ""Pardon, Ms Taylor. Mr. Ford says Ms Williams needs to stay here a few days to recover from the distress you caused her. She chose the master bedroom. You'll move to the basement temporarily.""
 Sophia smiled. It didn't matter. She didn't care anymore.
 Not just the bedroom‚Äîshe didn't want Alexander anymore either.
 At midnight, Sophia was jolted awake by shrill screams.
 When she realized it was her pet dog, she rushed out like a madwoman. ""Poppy!""
 In the living room, Amanda was directing her friend to slash the dog repeatedly with a knife.
 Her vicious expression reminded Sophia of past nightmares‚Äîhow Amanda had once cut her fingers a thousand times with a blade just because Alexander complimented her piano skills, leaving her unable to play the piano ever again.
 Trembling from trauma, Sophia heard Poppy howled in agony again.
 Overcoming her terror, Sophia lunged forward, and shoved Amanda aside to cradle the bleeding dog.
 Furious that Sophia dared push her, Amanda snarled. ""How dare you, bitch! Teach her a lesson!""
 CRASH!
 A liquor bottle shattered against Sophia's skull.
 Blood streamed down, but Sophia shielded the dog desperately.
 The second blow landed harder.
 Her vision dimming, Sophia bit her tongue to stay conscious.
 As the third strike descended, a glacial voice cut through: ""Dare to hit my wife? Got a death wish?""
 Alexander raised his pistol, aiming at the attacker's head.
 Amanda instantly threw herself in front, weeping tearfully. ""Alexander, Mrs. Ford set her dog on me! My friends were defending me! This is my fault‚ÄîI shouldn't have stayed and angered her. I'll leave...""
 She took one step before Alexander yanked her back.
 ""You're my savior. No one has the right to kick you out.
 Amanda, I'll get justice for you on this.""
 Alexander approached, his gaze fixed on Poppy with terrifying coldness.
 In that instant, Sophia understood what he intended to do. Shaking with fear, she begged, ""Alexander, Poppy didn't bite her!
 Check the surveillance footage!""
 But the man showed no mercy, uttering cruel words: ""Sweetheart, mistakes demand punishment.""
 In the next second, Alexander snatched the dog from her arms and hurled it violently to the floor.
 With a few weak whimpers, Poppy coughed up blood and went still.
 ""No!""
 Sobbing, Sophia crawled forward and clutched the lifeless body. She glared fiercely at Alexander. ""You killed our baby!
 I hate you!""
 Years earlier, After losing her first baby because of Amanda's schemes, Sophia had fallen into deep depression. Alexander had brought Poppy home to comfort her‚Äîit was this little dog that had helped her heal.
 He had once promised, ""Poppy is our baby. I will always love her.""
 But now, on Amanda's word alone, he had killed the companion she had loved for six years‚Äîwithout even checking the truth.
 Gently, Sophia closed Poppy's unblinking eyes in death.
 As the dog's life faded, her love for Alexander died within her.
Chapter 3
 Sophia wept with heart-wrenching sobs. A pang of guilt struck Alexander, and he instinctively moved to help her up. ""Sweetheart, let me take you to get treated.""
 But she pushed him away without expression.
 Alexander clenched his jaw, about to speak.
 Sophia didn't even glance at him, cradling the dog's body as she walked outside to the oak tree where Poppy loved napping in the shade.
 She dug a hole with her bare hands, placed the dog inside, and covered it gently.
 ""Rest well, my baby‚Ä¶""
 She pulled out a lighter and tossed it onto the wooden doghouse.
 Six years ago, when Poppy first arrived, Alexander had built that house himself‚Äîsanding and polishing each plank with care. It had taken him ten months to finish.
 Now it turned to ashes in the flames, just like her six-year dream.
 Next, Sophia grabbed an axe and swung at the oak tree. Alexander had planted it for her, claiming oaks symbolized loyalty‚Äîjust like his love for her, everlasting.
 What a joke that love had become.
 With the final strike, the tree split apart, and Sophia's obsession shattered.
 Alexander, from now on‚Ä¶ I won't love you anymore.
 When Amanda claimed she was still frightened, Alexander canceled billion-dollar deals to comfort her at home. He tied her apron, sat her on his lap, fed her spoonful by spoonful, then gently wiped her mouth‚Äîdoing everything he had once done only for Sophia.
 For seven days, they flirted openly. But Sophia didn't care. Every day, she knelt on the meditation cushion, praying for Poppy.
 On Poppy's seventh-day memorial, as Sophia finished her last prayer, the basement door swung open.
 Alexander entered with his arm around Amanda, and said coldly, ""Give your wedding ring to Amanda.""
 Sophia stared at him in disbelief. ""Alexander, have you lost your mind?""
 He shrugged. ""She saved my life. As long as I can afford it, I'll meet any of her requests.""
 Sophia's fists clenched until her palms nearly bled.
 How absurd. This ring had been designed and placed on her finger by Alexander himself‚Äîone of a kind. He'd slipped it onto her finger, and said tenderly, ""Sophia, you're my only love. Never take it off while we're together.""
 She had obeyed. For six years, even when her finger was injured and bandaged, she never removed it.
 She'd believed their love would last forever.
 Now he demanded she surrender it to please another woman.
 Sophia suddenly laughed‚Äîat vows that meant nothing, at love that vanished overnight.
 ""Fine.""
 Alexander was taken aback. He hadn't expected her to agree so easily, and a strange unease twisted inside him. His throat felt tight. ""Sophia, wait‚Äî""
 But in the next second, Sophia pulled off the ring and threw it on the ground.""Want this secondhand item? Pick it up yourself.""
 She strode toward the exit.
 But before clearing the Ford family, bodyguards forced her to her knees.
 Alexander's icy voice cut through the air: ""Sophia, I spoiled you too much. Now you dare defy me to my face.""
 The butler handed over a thorn-covered wooden stick, used to punish subordinates who make mistakes. Alexander raised the stick and said coldly, ""Apologize!""
 ""I said everyone must respect Amanda, and you're no exception.""
 Sophia trembled, Alexander's favoritism toward Amanda had reached such an extent. Tears welled in her stubborn eyes as she looked at him. ""I did nothing wrong. I won't apologize.""
 Amanda hugged the man's arm and cried, ""Alexander, Sophia just can't stand you being good to me. She didn't mean to defy you. Please don't be angry""
 Her words added fuel to the fire; Alexander hated it most when others defied him.
 Sure enough, the next second, a stick as thick as an adult's arm came down high and struck Sophia on the back.
 The first strike made her vomit blood. Dazed, she remembered their first meeting six years ago: Alexander picking a flower by the roadside, kneeling on one knee, saying, ""Sophia, I like you. Be my girlfriend"".
 At that time, his eyes were full of sincerity.
 The second blow plunged her vision into darkness; the pain nearly made her pass out. She recalled five years ago, when enemies kidnapped her and demanded he cripple himself. Without hesitation, he had raised a knife to his own legs.
 At that time, he loved her so resolutely.
 With the third strike, Sophia lost consciousness entirely. Before passing out, she seemed to see Alexander on their wedding day‚Äîweeping with joy, vowing, ""Sophia, I will love you with all my heart forever.""
 But he broke his promise, he broke his promise...
 He beat her badly for another woman.
 Sophia lay in bed for seven days before barely able to get up.
 Just walked into the yard, she saw Amanda walking over with a smile, her face showing the arrogance of a victor. She waved the wedding ring tauntingly on her finger, ""Now Alexander's body and heart are with me.""
 Sophia replied expressionlessly, ""If you want him, then he's yours.""
 Amanda froze for a moment, then slapped Sophia's face, ""Bitch, he was always mine! You're a bitch! You seduced him away.""
 Enraged by Sophia's calmness, she raised her hand again‚Äîthen, spotting Alexander approaching, she suddenly pulled off the ring and threw it into the pond.
 Then, she threw herself into the man's arms and cried loudly, ""Alexander, Sophia bullied me, she threw away the wedding ring you gave me, she said I'm not worthy...""
 Instantly, fury rose in Alexander's eyes, ""Sophia, nothing to say?""
 Sophia met his gaze and said calmly, ""Would you believe what I say?""
 He smirked coldly, ""No, I only believe Amanda.""
 Sophia was pushed into the water to retrieve the ring.
 Darkness and cold instantly engulfed her.
 As a child, villagers used to put her in stocks for fun, she had a severe fear of water. Alexander drained all the ponds in the villa, until a year ago when Amanda said she wanted to grow lotuses, and Alexander made an exception.
 Sophia was almost suffocatingShe struggled desperately to swim up, finally swam ashore, but heard Amanda's crying, ""Alexander, Sophia seems unwilling...""
 ""It's not up to her.""
 His merciless tone was a death sentence. He ordered the bodyguards to hit Sophia down with bamboo poles.
 Every time she surfaced, they struck her down again.
 The unhealed wounds on her back split open once more. Soaked in cold water, the pain numbed her entire body.
 The pain in my body couldn't compare to a fraction of the ache in my heart.
 Alexander, I regret ever falling for you. I regret it so much.
Chapter 4
 Sophia lay unconscious for three days before waking.
 The maid attending her breathed a sigh of relief. ""You're finally awake, Mrs.Ford. Three days ago, after you sank underwater, Mr. Alexander was terrified. He held a gun to the doctor's head and said if they couldn't save you, everyone would pay with their lives.""
 The maid spoke of how frantic Alexander had been, how deeply he loved her.
 But Sophia would never believe that again.
 If he truly loved her, would he openly bring her tormentor home?
 If he truly loved her, would he personally kill the dog she cherished as her emotional anchor?
 If he truly loved her, knowing her had aquaphobia, would he order people to repeatedly dunk her underwater?
 Alexander, stop lying to me!
 After dismissing the maid, Sophia began writing her „ÄêLast Words„Äë.
 ""Alexander, by the time you read this, I'll likely be gone...""
 They had promised to write love letters to each other every year, exchanging them on their anniversary.
 They had written them for five years. But since Amanda saved him last year, Alexander had stopped writing. And as for the 999 love letters Sophia wrote‚Äîhe hadn't read a single one.
 She placed the „ÄêLast Words„Äë in a box, then burned the love letters one by one.
 As the final letter caught fire, Alexander burst in. His pupils contracted violently as he lunged for the flames‚Äîbut too late.
 ""Sophia, why burn them?""
 Watching blisters rise on his scorched hands, Sophia replied calmly, ""They're outdated. I wrote new ones.""
 Alexander exhaled in relief, suppressing his unease as he reached for the box.
 Sophia stopped him. ""Wait for our anniversary.""
 The anniversary was on the third day after her fake death.
 For their seventh anniversary, she'd give Alexander a surprise he'd never forget.
 Hearing tonight's auction included her brother's bullet casing, Sophia rushed over with her black card. She had just taken her seat when Alexander arrived with Amanda and sat down beside her.
 He tenderly tucked Amanda's stray hair behind her ear, his gaze softening exactly as it once had for Sophia.
 As their lips drew closer and closer, about to kiss, Sophia gave a light cough. Alexander paused, and only then did he notice Sophia sitting nearby.
 His expression flickered with discomfort. He instinctively reached for her hand, but Sophia evaded it.
 Now Alexander only had eyes for Amanda‚Äîwhen did he last truly seen her?
 The first auction item was her brother's bullet casing.
 Amanda shot a provocative glance at Sophia and cooed to Alexander, ‚ÄúAlexander, I want it.‚Äù
 Alexander didn't hesitate. ""Of course, Amanda. I'll buy you anything.""
 Sophia dug her nails into her palm, forcing down surging emotions as she pleaded softly, ""Alexander, it's my brother's relic. Could you‚Äî""
 He cut her off coldly. ""Sophia, you're being difficult again. How many times must I say it? Amanda saved me. This year, I fulfill her every wish.""
 ""But‚Äî"" Sophia persisted.
 His voice sharpened with impatience. ""Enough. Stop making a scene.""
 As the auctioneer called for bids, Alexander immediately raised his paddle. ""Five million.""
 Sophia's nails drew blood from her palm. Resolve flashed in her eyes. Abruptly, she rose and signaled for an unlimited bidding.
 Unlimited bidding meant claiming the item at any cost‚Äîno ceiling.
 Amanda's face paled. ""Alexander, I really like this...""
 Alexander glared at Sophia. ""That's big talk. Don't embarrass yourself when you can't pay.""
 Ignoring him, Sophia stepped off the stage and swiped her card to complete the transaction.
 Alexander straightened up, remembering he'd given her an unlimited black card.
 The man's eyes narrowed into a dangerous glare.
 Sophia had just finished mourning at her brother's grave when her phone notification flashed.
 [The 999 intimate photos of Mr. Ford's wife will be auctioned tonight as the finale!]
 Sophia's blood froze.
 Only Alexander possessed those photos.
 Was this... his revenge?
 Sophia returned to the auction hall, immediately spotting Alexander lounging on the elevated platform, smirking lazily at her.
 ""Mr. Ford, you're really letting go? Last time someone just glanced at Sophia, you gouged his eyes out. How can you offer her intimate photos today?""
 A cruel smirk twisted Alexander's lips. ""She made Amanda cry. This is her punishment.""
 It felt as if a steel knife was twisting in Sophia's heart. The pain was almost unbearable.
 Because of Amanda, he'd show her private photos to every man.
 He used to be so possessive‚Äîhe would lock her away for days if any man looked at her, constantly repeating: ""Baby, you're mine. Only I see your body.""
 Biting her lip hard to hold back tears, Sophia walked in numbly and pressed the bidder paddle again and again under the men's malicious gazes.
 With each press, her heart grew colder. By the final bid, her love for Alexander had turned to ashes.
 She approached him expressionlessly. ""Satisfied?""
 Alexander glanced at her pale face and curled his lips into a smile. ""Sorry, not but.""
 Soon, she understood what he meant.
 He'd frozen her accounts!
 Unable to pay, She had no choice but to let her intimate photos be leaked online.
 She stared at him in disbelief, her eyes filled with despair, but the man only smirked coldly. ""Baby, if you don't learn the consequences of defying me, how will you ever behave?""
 Sophia's heart turned to ashes. She closed her eyes in agony.
 She thought it was over.
 But it was only the beginning.
 Alexander posted her shameful past from the remote village online!
Chapter 5
 The remote village where Sophia grew up was a place plagued by human traffickers. She'd been taken there with her mom, witnessing villagers torture her mom to death.
 After coming to Washington, Alexander had found countless therapists to help her heal.
 It took six years for her to finally move on from the past. However, her husband, the man who claimed to love her, tore open her most hidden wounds and exposed them to all.
 Sophia's PTSD flared. She collapsed to her knees, gasping for air as violent tremors wracked her body.
 The crowd's whispers sharpened into blades.
 ""Ms Taylor grew up in that filth? She's probably been slept with by countless men.""
 ""No wonder she hooked Mr. Ford. Must be incredible in bed.""
 Some even threw money at her and asked how much she charged per night.
 Alexander saw it all. His eyes flickered over the scene once before he took Amanda' hand and walked away, abandoning Sophia to the humiliation without a backward glance.
 Sophia didn't remember how she got home. Exhausted, she stared at the ceiling with dull, lifeless eyes.
 The physical agony of depression crushed her. In that moment, she wanted nothing more than to die.
 Her phone rang persistently before she answered. ""The body for your fake death is ready, Sophia,"" Jasper assured her. ""Once the tracker's finished in two weeks, you can leave.""
 Hope flickered in Sophia's chest as his words sank in.
 She stared at the ceiling, her resolve growing firmer.
 No‚Äîshe had to survive and leave this place!
 She won't die for a monster like Alexander.
 He's not worth it.
 The butler insisted she attend a charity gala.
 A man approached her instantly. ""Mrs. Ford, I've seen your private photos. Amanda says you're cheap‚Äî100 dollars for the whole night.""
 Sophia trembled. ""Get away from me!""
 But the man grabbed her and dragged her toward the stairwell. She struggled helplessly as he tore her clothes roughly‚Äîuntil Alexander's furious voice cut in:
 ""What the hell is this?""
 The man dropped to his knees with a thud. ""Mr. Ford, your wife seduced me! She said if you can have Amanda, she can have men too. She asked me to sleep with her to piss you off.""
 He gulped. ""I wouldn't dare lie‚Äîbefore me, she had many men. I'm her hundredth.""
 Sophia caught the vicious glint in Amanda's downcast eyes. She suddenly understood it was all Sophia's scheme.
 ""Alexander! Amanda framed me!""
 But the next moment, a sharp pain shot through her abdomen as Alexander kicked her down the stairs. ""Sophia, you've grown far too bold.""
 Though he was smiling, his eyes were filled with murderous intent.
 Amanda gasped dramatically. ""Alexander! Sophia's bleeding down there! Did someone... get her pregnant?""
 Alexander's grin twisted grotesquely, jaw clenched tight enough to splinter teeth.
 Sophia was dragged back home.
 A doctor examined her with trembling hands and half an later, stammered, ""Mr. Ford... Mrs. Ford is pregnant.""
 Alexander kicked the coffee table flying. He grabbed Sophia's chin, snarling, ""Whose?""
 Shock froze her. Staring into those predator's eyes, she knew the truth would be her only shield.
 ""It must have been from that time in the garden three months ago.""
 But the moment the words left her lips, a sharp slap struck her face.
 Alexander's palm struck with brutal force, splitting Sophia's lip and drawing blood.
 The man choked her neck. ""Still lying to me!
 I gave you the contraceptive shot every time after we were done. How could the child possibly be mine?""
 What?
 Sophia was stunned.
 Then Amanda spoke up: ""Alexander promised me he wouldn't get you pregnant while he was with me. So, Sophia, that child absolutely cannot be his.""
 All strength drained from Sophia's body. Alexander‚Ä¶ he actually agreed to such a demand from Amanda?
 Alexander, is it really just repayment of gratitude that you feel for Amanda?
 Alexander ordered her tied to a wooden bench. Blows rained down on her stomach.
 Thud after thud landed on her body. The pain was excruciating, tearing through her, but Sophia stopped struggling.
 She knew it was useless. Nothing she said would make Alexander believe her!
 By the 200th blow, blood soaked her entire skirt. But she felt no pain anymore. When the soul goes numb, the body truly stops hurting.
 Throughout it all, Alexander's gaze remained locked on Sophia. Seeing her hollow, broken expression, he felt an indescribable ache in his chest.
 Suddenly, he roared: ""Enough!
 Stop!""
 He strode towards Sophia.
 Just then, Amanda gasped: ""Alexander, I feel dizzy‚Ä¶""
 Then she collapsed stiffly.
 In the next instant, Alexander scooped her up and rushed out.
 The moment Alexander left, Sophia crashed to the floor. Blood gushed from between her legs.
 Overwhelming agony surged through her, sharp knives twisting in her abdomen.
 She begged the maids to take her to the hospital. But without Alexander's order, not one dared to help.
 Sophia bit her lip hard. No!
 She couldn't die today!
 Only two weeks left until she could leave!
 She dragged herself towards the villa entrance, leaving a trail of blood behind.
 Finally, a passerby called 120 for her.
 ""I'm sorry, Ms Taylor. Your uterus was destroyed. We have to perform a complete hysterectomy. Even one minute earlier, we could have saved it. Such a shame‚Ä¶""
 Sophia lay on the operating table. The harsh, white light stung her eyes.
 After a long while, a calm smile touched her lips.
 It didn't matter. She never planned to marry anyone again. A womb was pointless now.
 From this day on, she would live for herself!
Chapter 6
 One week after being discharged, Sophia found herself surrounded by a group of ragged people.
 ""Mrs. Ford, you promised lifelong support. Why sell the foundation?""
 Sophia had wanted to help those from impoverished backgrounds like herself. Alexander had established the Sophia's Love Foundation for her.
 She called Alexander. ""You sold Sophia's Love ?""
 The man dismissed it. ""Amanda wanted a dress. The seller demanded Sophia's Love. Don't be petty, Sophia.""
 Sophia demanded, ""Do you even remember what Sophia's Love means?""
 ""It's just a foundation,"" he retorted impatiently. ""One week left in my arrangement with Amanda. I'll buy it back for you later‚Äî""
 Sophia hung up.
 She'd never forget Alexander's solemn vow six years ago: ""Sophia's Love is our effort together, just like our child. Even if I go bankrupt, I'll never sell it.""
 But now?
 He'd killed their dog. He'd killed their unborn child. And for Amanda, he'd sold their other ""child.""
 Alexander... Alexander... You've severed every tie between us.
 From now on, we're strangers.
 Three days later, on Sophia's birthday, Alexander threw an extravagant party, perhaps sensing her gloom.
 Drones performed aerial displays. Rose petals carpeted the venue. Luxury bags and clothes piled high...
 Sophia didn't glance at any of it.
 Alexander wrapped his arms around her waist from behind. ""Forget that bastard, baby. Once my year with Amanda ends, I'll have children with you.""
 He didn't know the child he'd killed was his own flesh and blood.
 Sophia had obtained a paternity test, paying the doctor to mail it to the Ford family after her death.
 Alexander... will you regret this when you learn the truth?
 Before Alexander could say more, a business partner summoned him.
 The moment he left, Amanda approached with a wine glass.
 ""Sophia,"" she sneered. ""I bribed the doctor to switch the contraceptive injections, then hired men to frame you for cheating. I had so many more plans, but Alexander believed it so easily. Do you know what that means?
 It means you're trash to him!""
 Sophia's fingers trembled. Jasper had sent her a button camera yesterday‚Äîshe wore it today.
 Mistaking her reaction for pain, Amanda smirked. ""Still investigating your brother's death?
 Let me tell you: I staged those private photos. That day, I broke every bone in his body. The deck was covered in blood‚Äîeven his brains were spilled‚Äîand he was still calling your name.""
 ""So before dumping him into the sea, I promised I'd send you to join him soon.""
 Suddenly, Amanda slapped her own face. Alexander's icy voice cut through the air behind them.
 ""Sophia! Bullying Amanda again!""
 ""I didn't!""
 ""I saw everything!""
 Alexander signaled his men to hold Sophia down, his gaze turning dangerous. ""Didn't I warn you she's my bottom line? Cross her again, and I'll make you repay a hundredfold.""
 Before Sophia could react, the bodyguard's hand swung through the air‚Äî
 Smack!
 The first blow landed, stinging like fire.
 Then came the second, the third...
 Sophia struggled desperately, her voice raw. ""Alexander, you're a fucking asshole!""
 Alexander kept applying ointment to Amanda's wound, his order icy. ""Continue. Don't stop.""
 Smack!
 Smack!
 Smack!
 The bodyguard's iron grip pinned her. Sophia twisted away, but escape was impossible.
 Blow after blow rained on her face, more relentless than a downpour.
 Her ears rang, cheeks burning, but she clenched her teeth, refusing to cry out.
 Finishing Amanda's treatment, Alexander asked casually, ""How many?""
 ""Ninety-nine.""
 Alexander narrowed his eyes, smiling. ""Then round it off.""
 The final slap sent Sophia crashing to the floor. She spat out a mouthful of blood.
 Her face swelled crimson, lips split, tear-streaked and utterly broken.
 But she was laughing.
 Just four days left until this torment ended.
 And before that? She'd unexpectedly uncovered evidence of her brother's murder.
 Amanda, you'll pay in blood.
Chapter 7
 Sophia applied medicine to herself in front of the mirror.
 The horrifying wound in the reflection mirrored the past she and Alexander could never return to.
 She extracted the video from the button camera and sent it to Jasper for backup, just in case.
 Jasper called: ""Sophia, how about arranging your fake death as a suicide?
 The location is...""
 ""Alright. I'll come find you in four days.""
 ""Darling, where are you going?""
 Suddenly, Alexander appeared behind her, a trace of barely detectable panic in his voice.
 Sophia hung up abruptly, her heart pounding.
 Alexander rushed over, grabbing her wrist to check the tracker embedded in her flesh.
 Finding nothing amiss, Alexander sighed in relief.
 Probably overthinking it. With the tracker, even if Sophia ran, he could drag her back.
 Alexander gently touched her swollen cheek and smiled, ""Darling, don't blame me. It's all because you misbehaved.""
 Sophia tried to pull away, but he seized her chin, his crushing grip pressing into the burning wound. It felt like a thousand needles stabbing her face.
 ""Darling, in seven days, my one-year agreement with Amanda will be over. That day happens to be our wedding anniversary.""
 Alexander narrowed his eyes, ""Don't upset me. If you behave, I promise we can go back to how we were.""
 Sophia lowered her gaze, hiding her emotions.
 Alexander, how dare you think that after all this hurt, I'd still wait for you? That I'd want to go back?
 Impossible!
 Never again.
 The day of departure arrived. Sophia went to meet Jasper, but the moment she stepped out, someone drugged her.
 She woke in an abandoned warehouse, seeing... Amanda tied up nearby.
 ""Sophia, today is your end!""
 Watching Amanda interact with the kidnappers, Sophia understood: this was her scheme.
 Sophia twisted her wrists. The bite of the rope into her flesh sharpened her focus.
 ""Amanda, what exactly do you want?""
 Jasper was taking her away today. She couldn't die here!
 Amanda laughed, ""Guess who matters more to Alexander?""
 Sophia closed her eyes. She also wanted to know.
 The next second, Alexander kicked the door open.
 Amanda wept, tears streaming down, ""Alexander, save me.""
 Sophia just watched him silently.
 Kidnappers pressed knives against both women's throats.
 ""Alexander, you can only choose one.""
 Alexander's eyes turned vicious, ""What if I want both?""
 The blades pressed closer, drawing blood on their necks.
 ""That's not your call, Alexander.""
 Alexander clenched his fists, hesitation flickering in his eyes.
 Then Amanda wailed: ""Alexander! I shouldn't have been kidnapped! They only wanted Mrs. Ford! It was Sophia who told them I'm your savior... She's the one who suggested this choice! She said... she wanted to test your love...""
 Instantly, rage radiated from Alexander. ""Sophia, I said I love you, and I mean it. My love for you is beyond doubt. But you shouldn't have hurt Amanda to test me. Since you want to play games, then‚Äî""
 ""Listen well. I choose Amanda.""
 After speaking, he rushed to untie Amanda's ropes, wiped her tears, held her in his arms with soothing whispers, never once glancing toward Sophia‚Äîas if the woman with a knife to her throat wasn't his wife.
 Sophia didn't cry or protest. She watched it all quietly, then suddenly laughed‚Äîa laugh dripping with endless mockery.
 Alexander, is this what you call love?
 Loving me means trusting another woman unconditionally? Loving me means abandoning me to die?
 Listen to yourself. Do you even believe it?
 Alexander strode past Sophia toward the kidnapper. ""Whatever your employer's paying, I'll double it. Lock my wife here for three days‚Äîteach her some manners. But if you touch a single hair on her head,"" his voice turned glacial, ""I'll scatter your bones to the wind.""
 Without another word, he swept Amanda into his arms and left.
 Alexander had played the godfather too long‚Äîaccustomed to giving orders, accustomed to blind obedience.
 He forgot not everyone can be bought.
 The moment Alexander vanished, the kidnapper rubbed his crotch and leered at Sophia. ""Mr.Alexander think I'm an idiot? Guarding a beauty like you? No way I'm holding back.""
 ""Wish I could play with you for three days,"" he sneered, closing in. ""But Miss Amanda says you die today. I'm a Williams mercenary. Orders are orders.""
 As his foul mouth lunged for hers, agony exploded in his throat. He gaped at Sophia, eyes wide with shock.
 Sophia yanked the blade free, kicked his chest, and rose to deliver three precise strikes.
 Every move flowed like deadly water‚Äîswift and ruthless.
 Self-defense moves Alexander himself had taught her. All those years of being called ""Madam"" weren't for nothing.
 The door swung open. Jasper entered, hauling a suicide victim's corpse.
 Sophia deleted the second half of the video from her phone, then pinned a button camera to the corpse's clothes.
 ""Jasper,"" she said tonelessly, ""deliver my body and this camera to the anniversary venue in three days.""
 She wanted Alexander to know how he'd shielded a murderer while destroying her.
 She wanted him to know how Amanda had framed and tormented her.
 She wanted him to know that when he chose another woman, she'd been defiled by a thug before taking her own life.
 The day he abandoned her would be their last meeting. She wanted Alexander to spend every remaining breath drowning in regret and agony‚Äîgutted, shattered, broken beyond repair.
 Finally, Sophia raised the knife without flinching and dug out the tracker embedded in her arm.
 She was free at last!
 Six years ago, Alexander had knelt to propose, vowing to carve her into his very life.
 Now, she carved him out with her own hands.
 Alexander, you'll never find me again.
 For the rest of your days, we are done

During the course of the year my store manager was on sick leave for 4 months and he appointed me as his substitute. It was tough, like 60 hours a week, no rest days, conflicts with other colleagues and so on. I also had to skip going on holiday. He then came back and I went back to work 45 hours a week and more or less back to my role. Despite this I feel very exhausted. 

Went on holiday (forced) for 2 weeks last month but didn't go anywhere. Couldn't unplug from work. I used to boxe but haven't been to the gym since February. I feel constantly tired. I can sleep for like 8/9 hours and not feeling recharged. Plus I don't work 9-5 but I either start at 5 am or at 1 pm. Sometimes I do a 9-5 or similar but it's mostly between an afternoon shift and a morning one. I don't have enough energy to do anything outside of working. I don't have a social life because out of my two friends remaining one has the tendency to disappear and the other went to Australia. But even if I had one I wouldn't want to go out.

I will say though, that just because I'm 33, you're in your early 20s and mid 20s you can still message me and I don't care if I've male friends at that age as I don't think me as a 33 year old making friends with early 20s and mid 30 years is weird.

However, before I close this I've received some very hateful chat requests messages that I would ask that would be stopped. Redditors complain that my posts are basically the same thing, which yeah haven't you heard? I'm an introvert. 


I'd do the same thing every single day because an introverted life is something that I want. I go outside every 5 days, because I've a mild phobia of people and the outside. There are sometimes where I only go out 7 days if I'm having a very bad day. 

However, please start calling my life a bot and not myself a bot. I'm sure there are Redditors that are here and get this because even though this is a ''friend.'' subreddit I'm sure there are some introverts living a semi-hermit lifestyle. 

However, making wild accusations that I'm a bot because I basically post that all I'm  doing the same thing  every single day which is cats, tea, energy drinks, sometimes coffee, Skyrim, music and YT is literally what my life is everyday with the cats. I'd nothing different and it'd very uncommon if my social anxiety isn't this stage is a prison that I will go to an event. 

Yeah, my life is basically a bot and myself isn't. I'm a real person with feelings behind a screen that feels emotion, music and connections on a strong level. Even if I want friendships that are online only right now doesn't mean I don't feel shit at all. That's just bull shit. 

I'd hope that I can find friendships here that can let me chat with them tonight because I'm really struggling with a lot of negative thoughts right now. 

I will ask this again, please stop commenting on my post if you've nothing nice to say and the same with my chat requests. 

With that being said my life is botting again, almost 1 something am, getting some wild berry tea, going on Skyrim on my PS4 and I've a cat with me. I would also  ask if your chat requests messages could be medium to long winded, keep me engaged, keep me interested, don't come up with something boring and basic.

I would rather prefer to have a pick up line from Sleep Token about our friendships, even though I'm looking for something more this is a friendship subreddit and things have to be kept that way and if you don't know Sleep Token then it's time do some homework üòÇ

The Tragedy of Lieto Fine: Friends as a Modern Fairy Tale about Trials and Fateful Love

Introduction: Reinterpreting the Comedy Genre ‚Äì Friends as a Modern Tragicomedy

As one of the most influential sitcoms in the history of television, Friends has become an indelible part of pop culture. The series, which depicts the everyday lives of six friends in New York City, is traditionally classified as a light comedy, whose primary purpose is to entertain and make people laugh. However, this analysis argues that beneath the surface lies a much more complex narrative structure. Friends is, in fact, a modern tragicomedy, the backbone of which is a love story based on classic fairy tale tropes: the epic, trial-filled romance of Ross Geller and Rachel Green.
This report explores the thesis that the lasting emotional impact and narrative momentum of the series stem not from situational comedy, but from deeply rooted dramatic and tragic elements and the narrative of a fairy-tale quest. We examine the series not as a psychological case study, but as a consciously created fictional work with a message. To this end, the analysis applies several theoretical frameworks. We use genre theory to define tragicomedy, with particular reference to the Renaissance concept of tragedia a lieto fine (tragedy with a happy ending), which describes a serious, suffering-filled plot that ultimately ends with a positive resolution. We then use Vladimir Propp's narratological model and Joseph Campbell's monomyth theory (The Hero's Journey) to explore the fairy-tale structure of the series, showing how Ross and Rachel's ten-season relationship corresponds to a classic heroic quest.
The analysis traces how pain and suffering are woven throughout the series, serving not only as subplots but as driving forces of the plot. It details how Ross and Rachel's relationship fits into the stages of the Hero's Journey, identifying external and internal adversaries, helpers, and those fateful, ""magical"" events that guide the plot along fairy-tale logic. The report ultimately concludes that Friends is not just a comedy series, but a modern tragicomic tale with a deeper message, exploring themes of fate, personal development, and hard-won happiness.


Section 1: The Theoretical Framework of Tragicomedy: Laughter in the Shadow of Pain


To interpret Friends as a tragicomedy, it is essential to understand the theoretical background of the genre. Tragicomedy is not just a random mixture of tragic and comic elements, but an independent, complex genre that strives to evoke an emotional response, capable of eliciting both laughter and pain from the audience at the same time.
The definition and historical background of tragicomedy
Tragicomedy is a literary and dramatic genre that combines the formal and content-related characteristics of tragedy and comedy. It can describe a tragic play that contains enough comic elements to lighten the overall mood, or‚Äîand this is key from the perspective of Friends‚Äîa play with a serious plot that ends happily. The genre's roots go back to ancient Greek drama; Aristotle mentions in his Poetics a tragedy with a double ending, which, similar to the Renaissance interpretation, means the happy conclusion of a serious plot.
The genre's flourishing during the Renaissance brought about the most relevant definitions. At the end of the 16th century, Italian playwright Giovanni Battista Guarini defined tragicomedy as a work that contains most of the elements of tragedy‚Äîsuch as a serious tone, the depiction of important events, and the arousal of sympathy‚Äî but never takes the plot to a tragic conclusion and deliberately mixes in comic elements. This concept, tragedy lieto fine (tragedy with a happy ending), perfectly describes the narrative arc of Friends: a central plot thread spanning a decade, filled with suffering and conflict, which ultimately ends with the much-desired happy ending.
Modern interpretations of tragicomedy further refine this picture. In these works, humor often functions as a coping mechanism in the face of difficult circumstances, highlighting the resilience of the human spirit. The genre allows for deeper character development, as the characters go through complex situations that elicit both laughter and tears, reflecting the real contradictions of life, where joy and sorrow coexist.
The ""tragi-"" in Friends: A Catalog of Suffering
Although Friends is essentially positioned as a comedy, beneath the surface lie deep and enduring tragic themes that fundamentally determine the characters' motivations and the plot. These dramatic elements are not just occasional conflicts, but the cornerstones of the series' tragicomic nature.
Family traumas: Several of the main characters carry serious childhood traumas that continue to define their personalities and relationships in adulthood.
Chandler Bing's trauma is the most obvious. His parents' stormy divorce and his father's transgender identity are used as a source of humor early in the series, but these events caused Chandler deep pain and shame. The divorce announced on Thanksgiving ruined the holiday for him for life, and the lack of parental role models makes him afraid of serious commitment.
Monica Geller has lived her entire life in the shadow of parental neglect and favoritism toward her brother, Ross. Her mother, Judy, openly criticizes and belittles her, leading to Monica's compulsive desire to please and her perfectionism. This constant struggle for recognition is central to the character's drama.
Phoebe Buffay's backstory is the darkest: after her mother's suicide, she ended up on the streets as a teenager and had to survive as a homeless person. Although the series often defuses this tragedy with absurd humor, Phoebe's eccentricity and sensitivity to tragedy stem from this deep trauma.
Personal and relationship crises: Adult struggles also add serious dramatic weight to the series.
Ross Geller's three divorces are a recurring joke in the series, but each divorce also represents a serious personal failure and heartbreak.
Monica and Chandler's struggle with infertility is one of the most dramatic and painful storylines in the series. The realization that they cannot have children naturally plunges them into a deep crisis, and their journey toward adoption is fraught with emotional trials.
At the beginning of the series, Rachel Green is a spoiled, dependent woman who has to fight for her independence and her own identity. This struggle is full of failures and humiliations.
Joey Tribbiani's constant professional failure as an actor is also a recurring dramatic element, representing the eternal cycle of hope and disappointment.
Jealousy as a tragic flaw: The central plot line, Ross and Rachel's relationship, is primarily driven by Ross's deep-rooted, almost pathological jealousy and insecurity. This trait, reminiscent of the fatal flaw (hamartia) of Greek tragedy heroes, leads to disaster time and time again and is responsible for the most painful moments in their relationship.
The symbiotic relationship between comedy and tragedy in Friends is one of the keys to the series' genius. Humor is not just used to relieve dramatic tension; in many cases, it stems directly from pain. Chandler's sarcasm is clearly a defense mechanism he uses to mask his childhood traumas and fear of attachment. Phoebe's absurd, surreal worldview is a kind of shield that protects her from the dark shadows of her past. The constant joking about Ross's divorces is a social coping strategy that allows both his friends and the audience to process the character's repeated failures. This realization goes beyond a mere listing of sad and funny scenes; it points out that the tragic elements are not random, but are the source of the series' most characteristic humor. ""Comedy"" cannot exist without ""tragedy,"" which clearly demonstrates the series' deep, structural commitment to the genre of tragicomedy.


Section 2: ""He's Your Homer"" ‚Äì The Basic Structure of Friends


The tragicomic framework of Friends is held together by an even deeper, more universal narrative structure: the classic folk tale. The central plot of the series, the ten-season-long story of Ross and Rachel's love, can be perfectly matched to a fairy tale mission, which we will analyze using the narratological models of Vladimir Propp and Joseph Campbell.
The theoretical framework of fairy tale narrative
In his work Morphology of the Folktale, Russian folklorist Vladimir Propp concluded that the plot of fairy tales is composed of constant elements, so-called ""functions,"" which follow each other in a specific order, regardless of which character performs them. Propp also identified seven constant roles (dramatis personae) that can be defined based on their function in the plot: the Hero, the Antagonist (Evil), the Donor, the Helper, the Princess (Sought-After Person), the Sender, and the False Hero.
In his book The Hero with a Thousand Faces, mythologist Joseph Campbell outlined the theory of the monomyth, or the Hero's Journey. This is a universal narrative pattern that appears again and again in the myths and stories of the world. The basic stages of the Hero's Journey are as follows: the Ordinary World, the Call to Adventure, the Refusal of the Call, the Meeting with the Mentor, Crossing the First Threshold, Tests, Allies and Enemies, Approaching the Innermost Cave, the Ordeal, the Reward, the Return Journey, the Resurrection, and the Return with the Elixir.
The central mission and the ""kingdom"" of the modern fairy tale
In the case of Friends, the central narrative mission is clearly the fulfillment of Ross and Rachel's love. This story is not just a chronicle of an ""on-again, off-again"" relationship, but a structured, heroic journey that follows narrative logic.
The ""Everyday World"": The first season of the series lays the foundation for the Hero's Journey, the ""Everyday World."" This world is a close-knit community formed by the six friends, a kind of chosen family that provides security and refuge from the challenges of the outside world. Modern fiction often struggles with the portrayal of adult friendships, as they lack the conventional framework of family or romantic relationships. Friends solves this problem by creating an independent, closed ""kingdom"" in 1990s Manhattan. The Central Perk coffee shop and Monica's apartment function as the ""safe castle"" or ""meeting place"" of the story, similar to Winnie-the-Pooh's ""Thinking Spot."" In this context, the ""family"" to be saved or restored is not based on blood ties, but on the chosen community of six friends, whose central pillar is the unity of the Ross-Rachel couple. The mission is therefore not only the fulfillment of romantic love, but also the consolidation of this modern, urban ""found family,"" which is the ultimate ""Elixir"" of the story.
The ""Call to Adventure"": Although Rachel's escape from her own wedding is her personal Call to Adventure, the shared story mission actually begins at the end of the first season, in the episode in which Rachel realizes (The One Where Rachel Finds Out). When Rachel learns that Ross is in love with her, this event corresponds to the ""Mediation"" function in Propp's terminology, when the hero becomes aware of the lack or misdeed. This moment sets off their shared journey, which becomes the narrative engine of the series.


Stage 3: The Hero's Journey: Ross and Rachel's Trials


The ten-season arc depicting Ross and Rachel's relationship meticulously mirrors the structure of the Hero's Journey and Propp's narrative functions. Their story is not a series of random events, but a carefully constructed narrative of trials, growth, and a fateful conclusion.
The Hero, the Princess, and the Antagonists
Ross as the Seeker-Hero: Ross's character perfectly matches Propp's ""Seeker-Hero"" archetype, who, even before the story begins, has been aware of the ""lack"" (the loss or failure to obtain Rachel). His journey is aimed at ""averting disaster"" and obtaining the ""Sought-After Person."" At the same time, he also bears the marks of another archetype, the ""Wannabe Hero"": his arrogance, selfishness, and mistakes are the main internal obstacles he must overcome to complete his mission.
Rachel as the Princess and the Transforming Hero: At the beginning of the story, Rachel plays the classic role of the ""Wanted Person"" or ""Princess."" However, she herself is also a ""Sacrificial Hero"" who suffers from a ""lack"": a lack of independence and self-identity. Her escape from her wedding is her ""Sending Out"" or ""Departure"" on her own heroic journey. Over the course of ten seasons, she follows a parallel Hero's Journey, during which she transforms from the ""Child"" archetype to the ""Creator"" archetype. This process of self-realization is an essential condition for the story's ultimate happy ending.
Villains and Trials: The obstacles in the narrative can be interpreted as fairy-tale adversaries.
External Antagonists: Characters such as Paolo, Julie, and especially Emily fulfill Propp's role of ""Antagonist"" or ""False Hero."" They are the ones who perform the function of the ""Foul Deed"" by separating the hero from the princess, thereby causing harm to the ""family."" Mark is a more complex character: he is a ""Donor"" to Rachel (giving her a job), but an ""Antagonist"" to Ross, triggering the central Trial of their relationship.
Inner Demons as Trials: The hardest battles are fought by the heroes themselves. Ross's jealousy and Rachel's pride are the dragons they must slay. Their big arguments, especially the conflicts surrounding ""The List"" and ""The Break,"" correspond to the ""Trials, Allies, and Enemies"" stage of the Hero's Journey.
Donors and Helpers
The other members of the group of friends are not just supporting characters, but fulfill key narrative functions according to Propp's model.
The four friends as archetypes: Monica, Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe collectively embody the archetypes of ""Helper"" and ""Giver"" archetypes. As ""Helpers,"" they provide physical assistance (e.g., providing Rachel with a place to live), while as ""Givers,"" they provide the heroes with wisdom and ""magical tools.""
Phoebe as the Oracle/Giver: Phoebe is the most obvious ""Giver"" . Her famous ""lobster theory"" is not just an eccentric remark, but a fairy-tale prophecy, a ""magical tool"" (knowledge) that reassures the hero and the viewer that the outcome of the quest is fated. Phoebe's statement that lobsters choose their mate for life and Rachel Ross's ""lobster"" are equivalent to the words of an oracle in the world of fairy tales.
The prom video as a magical device: The episode titled ""The One with the Prom Video"" is a perfect example of how a ""magical device"" works. The video recording from the past is an object that, when revealed at the right moment, ""saves"" the hero from a hopeless situation. The recording, which shows Ross's selfless chivalry, ""marks"" him as the true hero and leads directly to the prop's ""Marriage"" function (the union of the couple).
The Ordeal and the Resurrection
The ""Pause"" as the first Ordeal: The infamous ""pause"" is the central ""Ordeal"" of the story (Ordeal), the moment of the ""death"" of the relationship. Ross's subsequent infidelity represents the failure of the trial, leading to the heroes' long exile from each other.
The London Wedding as the Second Trial: Ross and Emily's wedding, where the hero says Rachel's name instead of Emily's, is another cathartic ""Trial."" This moment also marks the ""unmasking of the false hero"" (Emily as an insurmountable obstacle to happiness). This catastrophic failure represents another low point for the hero, from which he must rise again.
The final separation as the ""Road Back"": Rachel's decision to move to Paris is the last great trial of the Hero's Journey, the ""Road Back"" stage. In this stage, the hero must face the possibility of the permanent loss of the ""Elixir"" (fulfilled love).
""I got off the plane"" as the ""Resurrection"": The series finale is the classic ""Resurrection"" moment. Ross, having finally overcome his pride and fears, makes a final, revealing confession. Rachel's return is the ""rebirth"" of the relationship, allowing them to finally ""Return with the Elixir""‚Äîa mature, hard-won love, tempered by ten years of trials.


Section 4: Fairy-Tale Magic in the Modern World: Fateful

 Events and Symbolic Objects
In a story set in a modern, realistic environment, ""magic"" does not appear in the form of spells or supernatural beings. Instead, fairy-tale logic takes the form of highly improbable coincidences, fateful events, and symbolic objects that operate outside the rules of reality to drive the plot and test the heroes. In fairy tales, we do not question the realistic motivations of a curse or a talking fox; we simply accept that these things can happen in the world of the story. The same logic applies to the most improbable plot twists in Friends. These are not flaws in realistic storytelling, but strengths of fairy-tale narrative, signaling to the viewer that a different set of rules is in effect.
Case Study 1: The One with the Blackout
In the seventh episode of the first season, the New York blackout clearly functions as a magical intervention. The event is not random background noise, but a carefully planned narrative device that shapes the plot according to fairy-tale logic.
Preventing the mission: The blackout occurs at the exact moment when Ross is about to muster the courage to confess his feelings to Rachel. The darkness physically prevents the hero from completing his task.
Summoning the adversary: Out of the darkness, almost out of nowhere, the first serious ""antagonist"" appears, the Italian macho Paolo, who is led to the scene by a stray cat, the ""familiar"" known from fairy tales. Paolo's appearance is no coincidence; the narrative magically creates the first obstacle that delays the heroes' union and sets off a series of trials.
Case Study 2: The One in Vegas
The drunken wedding in Las Vegas is a chaotic, fateful event that is a textbook example of fairy-tale intervention.
The binding spell: The wedding acts as a kind of unintentionally spoken ""binding spell"" that creates a ""magical device,"" the marriage certificate. This document physically binds the heroes together, even when they have consciously gone their separate ways.
The failure to manipulate fate: Ross's later decision not to secretly annul the marriage is the hero's attempt to control the ""spell."" He believes that he can turn the bond imposed on them by fate to his own advantage. However, this attempt fails and results in further trials, lies, and conflicts, proving that the fate of the fairy tale world cannot be easily manipulated.
Case Study 3: The Ring After Emma's Birth
The clearest example of fairy tale logic and the magical power of symbolic objects can be seen in the episode ""The One Where No One Proposes.""
The appearance of the magical object: The engagement ring, which is the highest symbol of commitment in the world of the series, functions as a powerful magical object. The ring is given by a ""Giver"" (Ross's mother) to the Hero (Ross) with the aim of uniting him with the Princess (Rachel). However, the object falls out of the hero's possession and ends up in the hands of a ""Helper"" (Joey).
The fateful misunderstanding: The ring appears at the exact moment when Joey kneels down to pick it up. This action, combined with the symbolic power of the ring, creates a powerful illusion that Rachel, in her vulnerable state after giving birth, interprets as a real marriage proposal and and accepts it. This scene is so improbable that it can be interpreted not as a simple misunderstanding, but as a fateful, magical intervention. The ring, as a magical device, puts the characters to another test, revealing their hidden desires, fears, and the unresolved tensions in their relationship.
These events prove that the narrative of Friends consciously employs fairy tale elements. The improbability is not a weakness of the writer, but a device that elevates the story from the plane of realism to a higher, symbolic, fateful level, where the forces of love and destiny control the plot.
Conclusion: ""I Got Off the Machine"" ‚Äì The Tragicomic Solution and the Message of the Fairy Tale
The analysis clearly supports the initial thesis: behind the surface comedy, Friends is a deeply structured, modern tragicomedy, whose narrative backbone is provided by a classic fairy-tale quest. The series successfully combines deep, often painful tragic elements‚Äîchildhood traumas, personal failures, infertility‚Äîwith consistent, character-driven comedy, perfectly fitting the genre definition of tragicomedy. This tragicomic story is built on the framework of the Hero's Journey and fairy tale tropes, centered around the epic love story of Ross and Rachel.
In the series finale, Ross and Rachel's reunion is not a simple, clich√©d ""happily ever after."" This ending is a true tragedy with a lieto fine ‚Äì a tragedy with a happy ending. Happiness is achieved at the cost of a decade of suffering, trials, separation, and personal growth. By the end of the series, they are no longer the same people they were at the beginning of their journey; they are transformed heroes who have earned their ""elixir."" Ross has overcome his crippling jealousy and pride, and Rachel has gone from being a dependent ""child"" to a successful, independent woman, a ""creator."" Their happiness is authentic and cathartic because they fought for it.
The narrative structure of Friends ultimately conveys a complex and mature message about the nature of love. The story, with its fateful ""lobster prediction"" and magical interventions, suggests that true love is a powerful, fateful force. However, ten years of painful trials, internal struggles, and repeated failures make it clear that fate alone is not enough. The moral of the tale is that even love ordained by fate requires tremendous personal growth, the overcoming of flaws, and the courage for the heroes to follow their own paths before their love can truly be fulfilled. The final act, Rachel's decision to ""get off the plane,"" is not a passive acceptance of fate, but a conscious, willful act of a transformed hero. This is the main message of this modern tragicomic tale: a happy ending is not a gift of fate, but a reward earned through our own struggles.

U.S. Your location can be anywhere.

I decided to come out with a new posts as I thought this would be a better guide and I hope this can be posted here as I mean this in a friendship way, but I'm pro mental health for men and if any men are looking for a female friend that needs someone as an emotional support or to pick your brain if you're having a bad time out there, you can always chat with me, it's fine.

I will say though, that just because I'm 33, you're in your early 20s and mid 20s you can still message me and I don't care if I've male friends at that age as I don't think me as a 33 year old making friends with early 20s and mid 30 years is weird.

However, before I close this I've received some very hateful chat requests messages that I would ask that would be stopped. Redditors complain that my posts are basically the same thing, which yeah haven't you heard? I'm an introvert. 

I'd do the same thing every single day because an introverted life is something that I want. I go outside every 5 days, because I've a mild phobia of people and the outside. There are sometimes where I only go out 7 days if I'm having a very bad day. 

However, please start calling my life a bot and not myself a bot. I'm sure there are Redditors that are here and get this because even though this is a ''friend.'' subreddit I'm sure there are some introverts living a semi-hermit lifestyle. 

However, making wild accusations that I'm a bot because I basically post that all I'm  doing the same thing  every single day which is cats, tea, energy drinks, sometimes coffee, Skyrim, music and YT is literally what my life is everyday with the cats. I'd nothing different and it'd very uncommon if my social anxiety isn't this stage is a prison that I will go to an event. 

Yeah, my life is basically a bot and myself isn't. I'm a real person with feelings behind a screen that feels emotion, music and connections on a strong level. Even if I want friendships that are online only right now doesn't mean I don't feel shit at all. That's just bull shit. 

I'd hope that I can find friendships here that can let me chat with them tonight because I'm really struggling with a lot of negative thoughts right now. 

I will ask this again, please stop commenting on my post if you've nothing nice to say and the same with my chat requests. 

With that being said my life is botting again, almost 1 something am, getting some wild berry tea, going on Skyrim on my PS4 and I've a cat with me. I would also  ask if your chat requests messages could be medium to long winded, keep me engaged, keep me interested, don't come up with something boring and basic.

I would rather prefer to have a pick up line from Sleep Token about our friendships, even though I'm looking for something more this is a friendship subreddit and things have to be kept that way and if you don't know Sleep Token then it's time do some homework üòÇ

1o8ddha,https://v.redd.it/vfkqmqjajivf1,[Rocket R91] starting/stopping in quick succession during heating without lever activation,"Hello fellow coffee nerds,

  
I have had a Rocket R91 for a couple of years now and was very happy with the machine until recently, but I've now got some problems...

Problem:  
\- During heating, the machine starts and stops the extraction in quick succession (multiple times per second)  
\- It only occurs during heating, never when the machine is fully heated  
\- I can't stop the extraction by using the lever, nor activating a ""normal"" start, nor stopping the behaviour  
\- See the video (For the brown water coming out: I complete idiot, forgot to remove the coffee puck from the previous morning, obviously the espresso did its thing too late...).

Additional information:  
\- XPV35 Rocket R91V FW ver. 1.08  
\- Controller Board FW ver. 1.5  
\- The clock resets itself overnight to 00:00, but only if the machine is turned off for longer than a couple of hours. If I set the clock in the morning and restart the machine in the afternoon, it keeps track of the time.

I wanted to ask you, fellow coffee nerds, for advice. Have you encountered this behaviour before? Do you have any suggestions on what it could be, or how to fix it (would be awesome)?

I couldn‚Äôt tell anybody either (as if they would believe me). Fortunately, I‚Äôm used to enjoying mystical inspirings in the solitude of my own mind. I savor every sparkle, as if it‚Äôs just for me.

What was so endearing, was that the phenomenon sure didn‚Äôt mind that I wasn‚Äôt voicing these things to other people. In fact, I think the solitude, while isolating at times, can serve as a bit of a conduit.

There was something intimate about this series of events that made me feel seen. As if I and my perceptions were enough to fuel the magic.

# Hot box garage

In August of 2023, during the heat of my awakening, my husband and I went to see an old friend. Her name was Margie and we knew her through the oppressive fundamentalist church we‚Äôd all grown up in.

Margie and I were escapees from that community. We‚Äôd seen each other through pivotal life events, and she was my gateway to a lot of things during my teenage years‚Äînotably, weed.

We hadn‚Äôt seen each other in a long while, and she moved into a new place just a mile down the road from my husband and I, so we went to reconnect. It really did not surprise me that when we came up her long, gravel driveway and settled into her camped-out garage that her next move was to whip out a pipe and start packing.

Sure, there were several kids in the yard and I didn‚Äôt know who they all belonged to, but Margie was very non-secretive about her vices, so, when in Rome‚Ä¶

We enjoyed some catching up time, reliving old memories and telling the tales of new ones. We lounged on fold-up chairs seated around an ancient, beat-up coffee table. The space was shared with a tireless car on a jack and a Harley Davidson motorcycle.

It had only been about a half hour of reminiscing before Margie brought the pipe out again and went to packing another bowl.

Welp. Something something Rome.

Margie‚Äôs sister, Melanie, pulled up the drive in her car. I hadn‚Äôt seen Melanie in even longer a time than Margie. I was thrilled to see her and it was good to sit down and chat. Melanie considered herself ‚Äúopen minded‚Äù and was very outspoken about things like manifestation and astral travel. It seemed so fitting with the phenomenon fresh on my mind so I was totally down.

Once more, only about a half hour passed before Margie was packing that bowl again and we passed it around the circle. The sun had gone down and all the kids had gone home, though I didn‚Äôt remember them getting picked up.

Were we still in Rome?

Margie and Melanie were caught up talking excitedly about some topic with my husband. I sank deeper into my lounge chair and zoned out of the conversation, as stoned people do.

The edges of my vision began to crackle and crinkle, as if the screen of life was fraying.

Suddenly, from the corner of my eye, I caught movement down the driveway. From the darkening night emerged an enormous cat. Its fur was black and it stood tall enough that its back would‚Äôve reached my knees. It looked almost like a panther. I even heard the grit of the gravel beneath its paws as it walked toward me.

When I turned my head to look directly at it, it disappeared.

I was about to shrug it off as an effect of my high, when suddenly an actual black cat slunk out from behind the car tire. It paused and looked right at me, orange eyes glistening, before it crept away and out of sight.

I didn‚Äôt say anything as it would‚Äôve sounded nutty. I tried to focus on whatever discussion the other three had moved onto, until Margie busied herself with packing yet another bowl.

Rome was going up in smoke.

# Sacred paintings

Just a couple days after Margie‚Äôs garage was my daughter‚Äôs birthday party. We reserved a room at a craft studio where a bunch of little girls could make cute things.

Throughout the weeks before, I‚Äôd been reading Whitely Strieber‚Äôs newest book, *A New World* (very good, btw, definitely recommend). Near the end of the book, he has an experience with an entity that presented in the shape of a vesica piscis. That‚Äôs the shape of the center area of two overlapping circles, such as with a Venn diagram. It‚Äôs kind of oval but with the two ends coming to a point.

Here‚Äôs an excerpt:

*But this was not a person as we understand that term. It most resembled a vesica piscis, the intersection of two overlapping disks. It appears in Euclid‚Äôs first proposition, where it is used in forming an equilateral triangle. It is also both a Christian and Masonic symbol. In Medieval art, it was used to enclose figures of saints and of Christ. The lid of the Chalice Well in Glastonbury, England, contains a vesica piscis. In ancient times, the area enclosed by the vesica was more than just empty space. It was a sacred entity. This is why sacred figures were placed within it. The reason that it was considered sacred was that, before the development of sophisticated mathematics, geometry was used in the planning of structures. It was the foundation of human endeavor, and the vesica was the fundamental geometric form where all measurement began. Man built using geometry, and the vesica contained the basis of measurement. This is also why it is an important form in Masonry.*

This entity wound up becoming a teacher to Strieber. Overall, the book was having a serious impact on me. Strieber has a unique and powerful way of interpreting his experiences.

As I was standing in the craft room, largely bored (the adults were not included in the craft-making), I turned around and was startled at what was staring back at me.

Twelve inches from my face was a vesica piscis.

https://preview.redd.it/n5t9gidghivf1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=22ef5816726efd4cb52a6113331489576e7c13db

In this section of the book, Strieber argues that there is great purpose in engaging the visitors. That the level of coherence we must rise to in order to communicate with them must be done in the deepest of communion. He talks about how the way they speak to us is often through a series of demonstrations, not so different from what you see here in this tale.

The message was incredibly powerful: they have much to teach us, but we have to be willing to face the terror of the unknown and the void. The fear we feel comes from the dissolution of the boundaries with which we perceive ourselves--a kind of death--but when it wears away, what‚Äôs left is a purity of self that creates true freedom.

Worth mentioning, is that my own birthday just passed (late August 2025), while I was preparing to write this installment (I prewrite all my articles by several weeks). My family gathered at a restaurant to say goodbye to my thirties and, halfway through dinner, I looked up and saw this.

# Unlimited magic

A few days after my daughter's birthday party, we went back to Margie‚Äôs place. She‚Äôd had a good time and invited us to come again. This time, we sat out back by her fire pit, pipe making its rounds.

I kept thinking about that cat, telling myself it was nothing. Her neighbors probably have a black cat, I figured.

As we‚Äôre enjoying the heat of the fire at dusk, swatting mosquitos and talking about landscaping, I bring it up. My curiosity wouldn‚Äôt stop, otherwise.

‚ÄúHey Marg, do you or your neighbors own a black cat?‚Äù

She thinks for a moment. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a black and white one that lives over there. Why?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, this one was all black. It even had the orange eyes to go with it. I saw it last time we were here and was just wondering.‚Äù

‚ÄúNope. Haven‚Äôt seen a black one.‚Äù

A single beat passed, and all of us turn and look into the field to our right. An all-black cat slinks across, eyeing us up.

Silence.

‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ got a habit of bringing magical black cats with you?‚Äù Margie jokes.

Everyone laughs stiffly.

At that moment, from the tree above us, an enormous owl swoops down out of the branches. It doesn‚Äôt go far, just to the tree next to it, but it‚Äôs enough to have us all on our feet making sounds of surprise.

# Curtain call

The night after that, I woke in the morning, but not fully. I stalled out in that hypnopompic state and my vision was hijacked by a grey. It was blurred at first, but the being reached forward and pulled a curtain open, across the screen of my vision.

I saw it clearly, then. This grey had an especially bulbous head around the brain area. Its face was petite and it was wearing a high-necked jumper suit. I recognized them. During a hypnotic regression, I uncovered a memory of a grey who looked exactly like this who was my teacher throughout childhood.

I got just enough time to get a good glimpse of it before it let the curtain fall back down and I lifted to waking.",0,1760637587.0,Experiencers,0,0.5,False

I'm new to this sub and completely clueless about projectors. I checked the sub wiki so I'll try not to be annoying :)

Long story short, I recently moved and after long deliberation decided to invest in a projector instead of TV. I want a good one since I'm planning to live here for years. I took these points from wiki:

1. Maximum budget. / **lol i have no idea how much a normal projector cost but I'd say not higher than 300 EUR.** 
2. Screen size. / **I have a huge wall where I'm planning to ""watch"" stuff and it's around 100x120 cm. not the wall itself but the area available on the wall.** 
3. Distance from back wall or preferred mounting position to screen wall. / **I'm sorry but I really don't understand this question, i am not planning to mount anything :D, i just want to use my wall for reflection**
4. Seating distance to screen. / **about 350 cm**
5. How will you mount? (ceiling, rear shelf, table) / **i really dont understand what mounting means in this case :( is it where i'll put the projector? I was hoping to get one where I don't have to put high up since behind me there's a window and no shelves or anything. so coffee table probably if possible. something that can work even if it's not hanging from the ceiling or places high up.** 
6. Usage: Movies, TV, Games, Sports, etc.: / **Movies/series/TV. movie nights with friends mainly** 
7. Room type: Dedicated, Mixed use, Living room./ **i live in a tiny studio :)**
8. Ambient light, through lighting or light leakage from windows? / **i have curtains that blocks the light very well, i have a balcony door next where i'll be sitting to watch but i'm ordering light blocking blinds for that as well. but during the day it'll be light even if I close all the curtains and blinds. is there a projector that works well during daylight?**
9. Room colors: Walls, Ceiling, and floors. ([u/realycoldguy](https://www.reddit.com/u/realycoldguy)) / **i have a sad beige apartment LOL, jokes aside I like neutral colors so everything is kind of earthy colors. light brown/beige/white. Floors wooden, curtains and walls lighter beige.**

Universal Horror Unleashed- this is the obvious and shiniest option as it‚Äôs new, but not without merit! I really enjoyed the houses and thought the food was damn good. However, the price was a bit rough. 

Horror Vibes Coffee- This is such a cool spot, and while not a place you can spend a day at, I‚Äôve really enjoyed getting a spooky drink to start my day. The pastries are also decent, but honestly the art/decorations are my favorite. 

FrightDome- if you‚Äôve been to Vegas in the early 2010s or lived here, this is back! I actually know one of the managers and they couldn‚Äôt be more proud of bringing scares back to the AdventureDome, and I had a blast

Parade of Mischief at DTS- haven‚Äôt had a chance to see it this year, but I know I will and there‚Äôs plenty to do at Downtown Summerlin

Beverly Theaters: The Wake (50-movie horror marathon)- from classics to modern staples, there‚Äôs a bunch of horror gems being shown by them and is a yearly event I look forward to. 

Area 15- while not exclusively ‚Äúhorror‚Äù or ‚ÄúHalloween‚Äù there‚Äôs plenty of creepy and interesting things to see here lol

31 Screams Haunted House- Tivoli Village is doing a Haunted House Wed-Sun, and while I haven‚Äôt gone, my buddy said it was a good time. 

Zak Bagan‚Äôs The Haunted Museum- This is a bit out of the way, but there are some historical displays to see here and is a decent time. 

SAW and IT Escape rooms- these are pretty scary compared to your average escape room, but they are fucking cool! If you‚Äôre a fan of either series, I‚Äôd check them out. 

Let me know if I missed anything because I‚Äôve still got 15 days to celebrate!

~Hero Costume Appearance~

‚ÄúMio's hero costume has a green Japanese dress with black sleeves along with two cyan stripes on the bottom of her sleeves. She had cyan leggings along with her green knee-high ballerina shoes. The green flowers were at the bottom of her black skirt.‚Äù

Winter Hero Costume - ‚ÄúThe Hero costume is still the same. But with black gloves with a hole in the middle for her to activate her quirk in battles.‚Äù

Future hero costume - Mio‚Äôs new costume reflects her growth into a confident and capable hero. She wears a sleek, teal-and-black and dark cyan battle suit with a single-shoulder design and light armor plating shaped like vines and petals.  A belted sash wraps around her waist, flowing like leaves in motion and The black-and-teal guards on Mio‚Äôs arms are specialized support gear. Including black leggings on her. While her sturdy aqua green boots and greaves provide protection without sacrificing grace.

~Synopsis ~ 
""Mio is part of the wealthy Kobyashi family, with her father, Dr. Peter Kobyashi, possessing a healing quirk. Her mother, Julia Kobyashi unfortunately passed away from an undisclosed illness when Mio was 4 years old. Instead of attending regular school in her early years, she was homeschooled, but later gained acceptance into U.A. High School as she grew older. Mio harbored a dream of becoming a gardener, having the power to create and control plants. However, her aspirations shifted towards becoming a hero after deciding to protect those she cherished and offer healing after battles.""

~Dorm Room~
‚ÄúMio's dorm was beautiful as Her White Squared bed had curtains too but it was pink along with a puppy plush by the pillow on the left side of the bed by the window and the curtains. There was a dresser where her family portrait was with both of her parents and her young self in it with fancy clothes. Including a vase filled with colorful flowers. A closet where her clothes and shoes are. Including a coffee table with two circle pillows by it and a desk where she can study. Including having a small bookshelf filled with books.‚Äù

 ~Relationship~ 

Her parents {Dr.Peter Kobyashi & Julia Rosa/Kobyashi} - Mio deeply loved her parents. Even if her dad is overprotective around her and the others like bakugou. Though, she truly wish her mother was still alive so she can meet Bakugou and the others. Her mom's dying words were ""Don't let anyone change yourself for who you are now. Cause you'll always be a Sweet Delicate Flower in my eyes.‚Äù Meaning that I should remain true to myself and not allow external influences.

 Katsuki Bakugo ‚ÄúExplosion Floral‚Äù - Despite Bakugo's aggressive and short-tempered nature, Mio seems to be fond of him for who he is. However, she strongly disapproves of his tendency to put himself in danger, as demonstrated during the sports festival when she showed mercy before defeating him with her floral quirk. Deciding to let him win, she explains, ""Victory doesn't suit me. The only reason I joined to become a hero someday is to help people, not fighting others on who's better or not."" Despite his bluntness, Bakugo secretly admires her soft and warm-hearted nature, along with her unique combination of appearance and quirk abilities.

Izuku (Deku) Midoriya - Mio would likely see Deku‚Äôs kind and supportive nature and admire him for it. They would probably have some nice moments where they encourage and support each other, and Mio could offer some healing and emotional comfort to Deku when he needs it. Especially keeping Deku's quirk hidden along with Bakugo and All might. Knowing she has no other choice but to not break that promise between them. 

Ochako Uraraka - Mio and Uraraka share a bond of sisterly friendship, often supporting and uplifting each other. Both being kind and compassionate, they understand each other well and enjoy spending time together. Mio finds Uraraka's cheerful and caring nature endearing and is always ready to listen to her problems, while Uraraka appreciates Mio's calming presence and nurturing demeanor. They often spend downtime together, chatting and sharing stories, and Mio often looks out for Uraraka, offering kind words and words of encouragement when needed.

Shoto Todoroki - At first, they don't interact much, likely due to Shoto's aloof demeanor and tendency to keep to himself. Mio, being the kind and observant person she is, notices this and gradually starts to draw him out of his shell, with her positive attitude and warm smile. They begin to spend more time together, and Mio starts to admire his determination and strength in overcoming his past traumas. Shoto, in turn, starts to value Mio's kindness and understanding, and finds comfort in her steady presence. While they both get used to socializing things.

All Might {Toshinori Yagi} - Since Mio's mother, Julia, was close friends with All Might from their high school days, Mio likely has a close and affectionate relationship with All Might as well. Despite not knowing him for very long since her mother's passing when Mio was 4-years-old, she would still hold positive feelings towards All Might, seeing him as a father figure of sorts. All Might would also feel a sense of responsibility to Mio, knowing her connection to his late friend Julia, and would aim to support and protect her as best he can.
 
 ~Abilities~ 

‚Ä¢ Flower Manipulation - Mio can control, Heal and create plants by using her hands. She can generate a barrier of flowers and vines to protect herself and her allies, both for defense and camouflage. Especially making thorns around her if she needs to be alone or in a battle and capturing people or enemies with her vines.

‚Ä¢ Healing Touch - She can heal people and her healing factor is only about 80-90% as effective as her father's, however, she can restore energy. So for example, if someone's energy levels are low or they're quirk exhausted, she can heal them.

‚Ä¢ Acrobatic skills - Grew up adventurous, often climbing trees, rooftops, and exploring outside the family gates despite her father‚Äôs worries.

‚Ä¢ Floral Blade - With this quirk, Mio can manifest a blade-like weapon made of flowers and plants, which can also bend and adapt to her surroundings. The strength and durability of the blade are directly proportional to the emotional state of the user. When Mio is feeling strong emotions, the blade becomes more robust and stronger, while in a peaceful state, it becomes more fragile and easier to break.

‚Ä¢ ""Floral Fury"" - A powerful surge of energy from Mio's Floral Touch quirk, which causes sharp, thorny vines to emerge rapidly from the ground, effectively acting as deadly blades and traps for her opponents. This ability allows her to defend herself and create a protective barrier, inflicting severe damage and potentially deadly wounds if her enemies come into contact with the thorns.

‚Ä¢ ""Floral Archery"" - With her ""Floral Touch"" quirk, gracefully knocked an arrow made from a strong, pliable vine, taking aim with precise control thanks to her ability to manipulate plant matter. The ""bow"" had been molded from her quirk just moments before, yet it held the tension and form of a true archery tool. As she released the arrow, it flew straight and true, striking its target with flawless precision due to her expertise and finesse with her uniquely created weapon.

‚Ä¢ ""Healing Shield"" - It allows her to create a protective barrier around herself or others using a combination of her healing and flower manipulation abilities. This shield would not only provide protection and Unbreakable but could also infuse it with her healing power for both defensive, and restorative purposes.

‚Ä¢ ""Bloom of Life‚Äù - In the final arc, Mio's Floral Touch quirk could develop into a more enhanced and evolved form of her ability. With her awakening, Mio's quirk blossoms into a heightened form where she gains the ability to rapidly accelerate plant growth and creation, allowing her to create larger and more complex floral formations at an unprecedented rate. Furthermore, her healing capabilities extend beyond physical wounds to also include emotional and mental healing, truly symbolizing the life-giving nature of her power.

~Her Drawback~

Limited Healing Capabilities: While she can heal others, her healing powers have limitations. Serious injuries, like heavy scars that may be beyond her abilities.

Emotional Regulation: Mio's plant appearance depends on her emotions. If she's not in control of her emotions, she might accidentally let loose thorns or create unwanted plants.

1o8d4d3,https://www.reddit.com/r/48lawsofpower/comments/1o8d4d3/the_coffee_spill_that_changed_everything/,The Coffee Spill That Changed Everything,"It was one of those grey Monday mornings when even the coffee tasted tired. Maya had overslept again, her alarm drowned out by the hum of the ceiling fan and the rhythm of rain outside. By the time she stumbled into the caf√© near her office, she already knew she‚Äôd be late for the meeting she wasn‚Äôt supposed to miss. She ordered her usual, a large caramel latte and as fate would have it, the barista was new.

When the coffee arrived, Maya grabbed it too quickly, juggling her phone, laptop bag, and umbrella all at once. The cup slipped. A splash of caramel latte hit her shirt, her phone, and unfortunately,a stranger‚Äôs blazer. The man turned sharply, and Maya froze. She expected anger, maybe a sharp insult, but instead, he just laughed. Not a mocking laugh, but one that felt oddly warm.

Guess we both needed a wake-up call, he said, pulling napkins from the counter to help her clean up. His name was Ethan, a marketing consultant who, as it turned out, was also running late to the same meeting. They walked together in the rain, trading stories about bad mornings and worse bosses, their shoes splashing through puddles like kids who‚Äôd forgotten to care about being adults.

By the time they reached the office, the tension of the morning had melted into easy laughter. They ended up sitting next to each other during the meeting, exchanging knowing glances every time someone used corporate buzzwords like synergy or optimization.

That spilled coffee turned into a shared lunch, then a regular thing, coffee runs, brainstorming sessions, after-work walks. Months later, they started their own creative agency, the kind where work felt less like work and more like a daily adventure. Every success they built together traced back to that single moment of chaos on a rainy Monday morning.

Sometimes, Maya would still joke that the best decision she ever made was dropping her coffee. And Ethan would grin, replying, You didn‚Äôt drop it. You just spilled your way into a better life.

It was messy, it was unplanned, and it was real, just like all the best stories are.",0,1760637089.0,48lawsofpower,0,0.33,False

Ive struggled with ADHD since diagnosed at age 13 ( over 25 years ago). I was never medicated, but should have been. My time in school, grades, and probably life thereafter would have been smoother.

I‚Äôve been struggling with binge eating disorder for the last 2.5 years after a SA. I had severe ptsd symptoms, and then binge episodes. I‚Äôve been in DBT and in EMDR, which has helped. I put on 110 lbs in 18 months, lost a lot of sleep (binging at night), putt thousands of $ on credit cards to pay for food. My BED has caused suicidal thoughts as well.

A psychiatrist put me on Vyvanse, for both BED and ADHD, and it‚Äôs changed my life. My binge episodes have significantly decreased to almost nothing, and it‚Äôs also improved my ADHD symptoms immensely. My daily life is a world away from what it was. I am organized, motivated, efficient, and functional in my home life and job life. My BED has largely stopped, annd have now improved my finances, health, and marriage. I‚Äôm on a low dose still, as well, just 30 mg, and feel no need to increase. I‚Äôve only been on it for a few months. I have hope again, and am putting the pieces of my life back together.

I started developing pain, pressure, in my bladder and urethra, a few weeks after starting Vyvanse, and a sense that I need to go quite frequently. My bladder at times feels hard as a rock. I‚Äôve been tested several times for uti, also checked for vaginal infections, even had imaging done, and all were negative. My Gyn suggested tapering off the vyvanse to see if symptoms improved and they did. Once I went back on, the symptoms returned. I tried lowering to 20 mg, but I still have urinary symptoms. If I take one day on and one day off, I don‚Äôt have symptoms, but if I take it 2 days in a row, I do. I‚Äôve even weaned off coffee and any tea or excess sugar hoping that will improve things, but it hasn‚Äôt.

I‚Äôm feeling incredibly hopeless at the moment. Will all the stimulant medications cause this? Are there any stimulants that are less likely to cause this than others?

I have tried clonidine and straterra as well for adhd in the past. Stattera had a mild effect on adhd, but caused severe constipation requiring enemas. Clonidine made me very tired, helped with anxiety but not adhd symptoms. Neither had any impact on binging.

Both my issues have done a complete 180 on this medication, and I‚Äôm feeling really hopeless at the moment thinking I‚Äôll have to stop. Any suggestions welcome.",1,1760637088.0,psychiatryquestion,0,1.0,False

We‚Äôve been together a few years, but lately he‚Äôs treated me really badly ‚Äî some would even say abusive (mainly mental and verbal). Back in June, after a big fight, I reached out to a brujo who‚Äôs been incredibly accurate in readings. He‚Äôs let me know his mother is sepersting us, she‚Äôs been saying we shouldn‚Äôt be together and this all got ugly after a small disagreement with her (she‚Äôs ridiculous like every MIL) surely I found her jars and disposed of it. 
We started doing work together in June to soften him and bring back love ‚Äî lighting red, pink, blue, and yellow candles, using lovers candles, bracelets, and baths. I saw small improvements, but they never lasted. Lately, the brujo seems less confident ‚Äî no more baths or colonias, and the same candle has been burning for weeks.

So I decided to take things into my own hands. I lit a pink candle at home for 7 days with our photo, a Valentine‚Äôs note, and a petition for a loving, sweet marriage. For a few days, things went well ‚Äî then he suddenly shut me out again, refused visits, and won‚Äôt even talk about commissary.

A few days ago, I started a new setup:
	‚Ä¢	Red candle tied with a red bow and my petition paper (been 3 nights still lighting it, might finish with 5 days not 7 it‚Äôs melting fast) 
	‚Ä¢	Small white candle with a pink ribbon and our photo, small white candle with petition for peace (candles last 1 night they‚Äôre small)
	‚Ä¢	after white candles finished, Small blue candle for peaceful communication with petition to talk to me and our photo tied by a pink ribbon (lasted 2 nights)

I also made a honey jar for sweetness ‚Äî cleansed with banish-evil incense. It has our names, bay leaves, rosemary, coffee grounds, cinnamon, eucalyptus, and honey, all tied with a pink ribbon. I made three small tiny jars jars (one to carry, one to sleep with, one for maybe bury later) one medium jar with 2 pictures of us with our names in red in front and back, plus all ingredients listed. 
I dressed a pink candle with our picture, a peittion tied with red ribbon in a bow, drizzled some honey and cinnamon on it and am waiting for the red to finish to start the pink again. Should I?
I‚Äôd love to hear from others experienced in love or reconciliation work ‚Äî what do you think could be going wrong or blocking results? Should I continue on my own or wait for the brujo to pick things back up?",2,1760637041.0,Spells,0,1.0,False

I pulled a baby blanket and collapsed on the floor. Instead of depression, my craftiness took over and I saw a photoshoot that let me crawl. I did go manic, but that's okay. My kids are a little older now and I have a few ideas, but open to working with someone who has experienced it more heavilky (we need hands to help her off the ground from an overloaded kitchen, and another person doing the dishes. And other ideas experiencers might have while well for what help through the shame might look like.) Basically, it's an experiential project to highlight motherhood mental health. I'd like to offer the community a space to write poetry for each pose over the winter if it turns out okay, and read them with me in a recording studio (or I can read them with everything I've got) and then put them on a CD player with the photos somewhere. I'm willing to pay a standard fee for a good spaceholder to explore my modeling potenital lol.  Currently I am at a place where it's about feeling edges for me and holding boundaries. I'm open to creativity and happy o make my house a mess. I have a guitar we can smash for the rage that eats us alive. A few ideas for an artsy photoshoot, then we can decide what to actually do with them. If you know anyone who might be intersted please drop their info (or DM it)",1,1760636769.0,northbay,0,1.0,False

1o8cxgd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1o8cxgd/is_this_manipulation/,Is this manipulation?,"I have recently spoke to an old friend who I have known since middle school but had not heard from for 20 years (we are both 40yo now).     
We happened to be seated at the same table at a common friend's wedding and he spoke to me first, asked if we could get coffee some time.      
      
I don't feel super comfortable with this person because back in middle school he and another girl were my only friends but they had a tendency to leave me behind at every and all chances when groups of 3 could not be formed (in school they usually ask you to be in 2 kids for lining up or buss rides ecc)     
For me our friendship had died by a thousand cuts. Getting worse and worse when we went to the same high school when he finally completely stopped interacting with me and hung out with completely different people.     
      
When we were in our 20s he had some drama that I will not say too much about because it's none of my business, he wanted my support despite the fact that I knew nothing of the situation (he didn't really inform me) and didn't feel like I could really pick sides. I told him I didn't care about any of that. Obviously that felt bad for him and that's where he thinks our friendship ended.       
       
Now I knew he was very upset, rightfully so because I was rude, and since he was talking to me again I thought he probably only wanted to chitchat and sort of ignore the past.   
      
One day I responded to one of his stories and after the random conversation he suddenly brings up the drama story that he perceived as the end of our friendship.     
So I thought he wants to fully mend this relationship, we are going to talk everything out.      
We discuss it, I apologise and explain a bit of my point of view. I tell him that I felt our friendship had died long before that, he seems a bit shocked and in disbelief. Still he seems positive about the conversation. The topic shifts and then the conversation ends.      
       
Because of this I think that he wants to mend this relationship so after taking time to articulate my feelings I decide to bring up my end of the drama because, as I said, I just didn't feel comfortable with him because of it. The feeling of exclusion back in school just persisted.     
he takes this very badly, he says it's not the time to talk about such old stuff, he was hoping we could throw a ""bad story"" in the past and just have a good relationship now.     
Keeps saying I'm just projecting.      
After a really long talk admits that he and that other girl wanted to talk about ""things that you thought were silly and that probably made you feel less than, so that's why you thought we were excluding you"".     
To me this last sentence sounds like admitting that they did want to leave me behind. I have no idea what these ""silly thing"" were.  
    
I feel very upset about this because I feel like he wanted his trauma addressed but I have to be quiet about mine.    
Do you think this is normal behaviour for someone who ""wants the past to be in the past""?     
Like if I wanted that I wouldn't have brought up the past at all, but he did and completely unprompted too.",3,1760636661.0,AutismInWomen,3,1.0,False
1o8cxeg,https://www.reddit.com/r/interviews/comments/1o8cxeg/hiring_manager_brought_up_his_colleagues_morning/,Hiring manager brought up his colleague's morning poop habits: a story,"Enough years have passed for me to feel comfortable sharing this little, bizarre story. Let me set the stage. This is long. TLDR at the end. 

Me: I was a 24-year-old woman, a year out of college, working at a failing startup. I had a good relationship with the CEO, who offered to help me find a new job through her connections. She introduced me to the CIO of a company seeking a health IT trainer. The salary offered was WAY more than I could have bargained for at that age. I jumped at the opportunity to take the interview. 

So I show up. The two hiring managers, both men in their 40s, began, and it became immediately, incredibly clear that they were two of the most awkward souls to roam the Earth. 

Neither of them could make direct eye contact with me. No biggie though‚ÄîI know some people are neurodivergent and feel uncomfortable doing so. However, I'm now 30 minutes into this interview, and I have not made a singular connection with another human being's pupil. They seemed more nervous than I was. I say to myself, ""Whatever, the pay is good, hang in there, girl."" 

They invited me to visit their office downstairs, where we'll be working. They open the door. 

It's a gorgeous, 70-something-degree sunny Spring day, with a beautiful breeze, not a cloud in the sky. It's about 1 PM, and their office has every window shut, every blind down, every light off. I see one man in the back, sitting at a computer in the dark, not facing us, lit up by the light on his screen. I look around. He is the only person in there.

Piles and piles of miscellaneous wires, IT equipment, and other items are strewn about. It looked like their office fucking exploded. There is shit all over the place, all over the floors, and each desk is covered in random bullshit and literal toys. There are two coat racks filled with Nerf guns. There are probably 40-50 Nerf bullets hanging around on the floor. I take a deep breath. ""They're cool, they like to have fun, Nerf guns are fun,"" I reassure myself. 

They walk me through what is basically a pitch black office. No one turns on the lights. They call out to the man on the computer. In the blink of an eye, he turns around, waves half-heartedly without making a sound or a vocal introduction, and turns back around toward his screen. Hm. 

Finally, one of the hiring managers shows me to my potential desk. It's next to the bathroom. He laughs. I laugh. Why are we laughing?

""Well, John here is going to have to change up his morning routine if you're working here,"" says Paul. 

John turns beet red. He replies, ""Paul... dude... don't...""

I'm confused. I see a weight rack next to my potential desk. I say, ""Oh, what, do you lift some weights over here in the morning or something?""

""No, no, John drinks a large coffee every morning and uses that bathroom to take a giant morning dump. Stinks up the whole place for hours,"" says Paul. 

""Don't say that in front of *the girl*!"" John's pissed. He turns to me, barely looking me in the eye, and sheepishly says while rubbing the back of his neck, ""There's another bathroom outside, I can use that one.""

""But you love dumping in that one!"" says Paul, earnestly. 

I am grinning ear to ear in disbelief. Smiling so hard to cover up the fact that I want to burst out fucking laughing at what I'm hearing. We wrap up, and as I'm walking out the front door, I can faintly hear John saying, ""Why the fuck would you bring that up to her?""

I got in my car and laughed until I cried. What the actual fuck. I decided then and there that I wasn't taking the job, despite the amazing pay. The smell of John's dumps wasn't going to be worth it. 

**TLDR: Viciously awkward hiring managers can't look me in the eye, bring me to their dumpster fire dungeon of an office, introduce me to my potential desk next to the bathroom, and warn me of one of their stinky morning shit habits. I denied the job offer.**",5,1760636658.0,interviews,0,1.0,False

>Yes, of course I am still working on **THE WINDS OF WINTER**.¬†¬† I have stated that a hundred times in a hundred venues, having to restate it endlessly is just wearisome. ¬†¬† ¬† **I made a**¬†***lot***¬†**of progress on WINDS in 2020, and less in 2021‚Ä¶ but ‚Äúless‚Äù is not ‚Äúnone.‚Äù**  
The world of Westeros, the world of A SONG OF ICE & FIRE, is my number one priority, and will remain so until the story is told.¬†¬† But Westeros has become bigger than THE WINDS OF WINTER, or even A SONG OF ICE & FIRE.¬†¬† In addition to WINDS, I also need to deliver the second volume of Archmaester Gyldayn‚Äôs history, FIRE & BLOOD.¬†¬† (Thinking of calling that one BLOOD & FIRE, rather than just F&B, Vol 2).¬†¬† Got a couple hundred pages of that one written, but there‚Äôs still a long way to go.¬†¬† I need to write more of the Dunk & Egg novellas, tell the rest of their stories, especially since there‚Äôs a television series about them in development.¬†¬† There‚Äôs a lavish coffee table book coming later this year, an illustrated, condensed version of FIRE & BLOOD done with Elio Garcia and Linda Antonsson (my partners on THE WORLD OF ICE AND FIRE), and my Fevre River art director, Raya Golden.¬†¬† And another book after that, a Who‚Äôs Who in Westeros.¬† And that‚Äôs just the books.  
...  
And in addition to all that, let me say one again, yes, **I am still working on WINDS OF WINTER.**

>**Which brings me to THE WINDS OF WINTER. Most of you know by now that I do not like to give detailed updates on WINDS**.¬†¬† I am working on it, I have been working on it, I will continue to work on it.¬†¬† (Yes, I work on other things as well).¬†¬† I love nothing more than to surprise my readers with twists and turns they did not see coming, and I risk losing those moments if I go into too much detail.¬†¬† Spoilers, you know.¬†¬† Even saying that I am working on a Tyrion chapter, as I did last week, gives away the fact that Tyrion is not dead.¬†¬† Reading sample chapters at cons, or posting them on line, which I did for years, gives away even more.¬†¬† I actually quite enjoyed doing that, until the day came that I realized I had read and/or posted the first couple of hundred pages of WINDS, or thereabouts.¬† If I had kept on with the readings, half the book might be out by now. So I am not going to give you all any kind of detailed report on the book, but‚Ä¶ I will say this. I have been at work in my winter garden.¬†¬† Things are growing‚Ä¶ and changing, as does happen with us gardeners.¬†¬† Things twist, things change, new ideas come to me (thank you, muse), old ideas prove unworkable, I write, I rewrite, I restructure, I rip everything apart and rewrite again, I go through doors that lead nowhere, and doors that open on marvels. Sounds mad, I know.¬†¬† But it‚Äôs how I write.¬†¬† Always has been.¬†¬† Always will be.¬†¬† For good or ill. What I have noticed more and more of late, however, is my gardening is taking me further and further away from the television series.¬†¬† Yes, some of the things you saw on HBO in GAME OF THRONES you will also see in THE WINDS OF WINTER (though maybe not in quite the same ways)‚Ä¶ but much of the rest will be quite different. And really, when you think about it, this was inevitable.¬†¬† The novels are much bigger and much much more complex than the series.¬†¬† Certain things that happened on HBO will not happen in the books.¬†¬† And vice versa.¬†¬† I have viewpoint characters in the books never seen on the show: Victarion Greyjoy, Arianne Martell, Areo Hotah, Jon Connington, Aeron Damphair ¬† They will all have chapters, and the things they do and say will impact the story and the major characters who were on the show.¬†¬† I have legions of secondary characters, not POVs but nonetheless important to the plot, who also figure in the story: Lady Stoneheart, Young Griff,¬† the Tattered Prince, Penny, Brown Ben Plumm, the Shavepate, Marwyn the Mage, Darkstar, Jeyne Westerling.¬† Some characters you saw in the show are quite different than the versions in the novels.¬†¬† Yarra Greyjoy is not Asha Greyjoy, and HBO‚Äôs Euron Greyjoy is way, way, way, way different from mine.¬†¬† Quaithe still has a part to play.¬† So does Rickon Stark.¬†¬† And poor Jeyne Poole.¬†¬† And‚Ä¶ well, the list is long.¬†¬†¬† (And all this is part of why WINDS is taking so long.¬†¬† This is¬†*hard*, guys). Oh, and there will be new characters as well.¬†¬† No new viewpoints, I promise you that, but with all these journeys and battles and scheming to come, inevitably our major players will be encountering new people in lands far and near. One thing I can say,¬† in general enough terms that I will not be spoiling anything:¬† not all of the characters who survived until the end of GAME OF THRONES will survive until the end of A SONG OF ICE & FIRE, and not all of the characters who died on GAME OF THRONES will die in A SONG OF ICE & FIRE. ¬† (Some will, sure.¬† Of course. ¬† Maybe most. ¬† But definitely not all) ¬† ((Of course, I could change my mind again next week, with the next chapter I write. ¬† That‚Äôs gardening)). And the ending?¬†¬† You will need to wait until I get there.¬†¬† Some things will be the same.¬†¬† A lot will not. No doubt, once I am done, there will be huge debate about which version of the story is better.¬†¬† Some people will like my book, others will prefer the television show.¬†¬† And that‚Äôs fine, you pays your money and your makes your choice.¬†¬† (I do fear that a certain proportion of fans are so angry about how long WINDS has taken me that they are prepared to hate the book, unread.¬†¬† That saddens me, but there nothing I can do about it, but write the best book that I can, and hope that when it comes out most fans will read it with clean hands and an open mind). That‚Äôs all I can tell you right now.¬† I need to get back to the garden.¬†¬† Tyrion is waiting for me.

So my mom (62f) went to the country side with her friend for a vacation. She had a fight with my dad so when her friend invited her she left. 
Today, she came back secretly. I (26f) called her I was speaking about a problem I had with uni and jokingly I said ‚Äú I shouldn‚Äôt listen to you when you told me to go ‚Äú. And than she told me she is coming and I need to pick her up at the side of the road. (Small detail : my mom don‚Äôt know how to describe places) . 
So I was like where exactly and she said ‚Äú from the road that leads to the south N2‚Äú and I was like ‚Äú but mom you are coming from the north , the N1 that leads to the center so where exactly ‚Äú she kept on saying no come to the N2 . So I started referring to different places around that road and I understood what she was talking about. Then when I was going she call and said don‚Äôt come from the shortcut. I was like what shortcut stay where you are I am coming.
I started driving she called me again and she knows that I don‚Äôt use my phone while I pick but told her to stop calling I am on my way. 
Whene I reached where she is I saw her and I was going to pull over. She started screaming. She thought I didn‚Äôt see her. I parked the car, came down and started taking care of her luggage and I made a comment ‚Äú this is N2 road You could‚Äôve just told me next to the police station. I would‚Äôve known where you were speaking about, but it doesn‚Äôt matter let‚Äôs go.‚Äù When she came into the call she kept on system that she‚Äôs right and that the road she referring to is correct. And of course because I‚Äôm pissed myself I insisted that I am correct. She started screaming and I started screaming and by the end I just gave up and said OK you are right. OK stop it.
We went back home when we are on the road. She was like because you were attitude. I‚Äôm not taking you anywhere, but I thought that I was going to tell you let‚Äôs go have a coffee together. I was like if you want to let‚Äôs go, but if you don‚Äôt, let‚Äôs go home doesn‚Äôt matter. I want to have lunch. I didn‚Äôt eat anything. I thought that was it but on the road home, she broke up the university problem and she was like I didn‚Äôt tell you to do anything. You went by your own choice and I was like I was joking. I know I didn‚Äôt blame you. I was just telling you went wrong with me. Nothing more nothing less.
We reached home as usual I took care of her luggage and came in . 
At this point I shut down so I went to grab the dinner and started eating said nothing. My father and my brother came for greetings. And she started making snippy comments so my brother left but my dad stayed and started joking with her. She went to the kitchen so that there is some dishes in the kitchen sink. She came back at the table with me and started making comments. ‚Äú why did you leave it that way who is going to clean that up? I‚Äôm not cleaning anything. I‚Äôm not helping you. I‚Äôm going to live just like you. I don‚Äôt care.‚Äù so I answered her ‚Äú I‚Äôll take care of everything. Don‚Äôt mind it just sit down and eat with me and that‚Äôs enough. Don‚Äôt mind anything. It‚Äôs our responsibility not yours. One of us will clean it eventually.‚Äù She glared at me. She didn‚Äôt like that I interfered because she was making these comments to anger, my father. She kept on blaming him because he disrespected her and that he doesn‚Äôt appreciate her effort, so that‚Äôs why she left. And that she no cares about us now since we don‚Äôt appreciate our efforts and that she had enough. Everyone of us needs to be responsible for themselves.
So my dad jokingly said ‚Äú don‚Äôt eat the food I made‚Äù and he was laughing she pushed the dish away and she was like I‚Äôm not eating. Mind you I was eating from that dish while everything is happening. I just stood. I‚Äôve had enough at this point. I‚Äôve heard enough snappy  comments so I snapped. What I said was:
‚ÄúEnough that‚Äôs enough you came back from a vacation. Go change your clothes. Come eat some food and go rest. enough of these comments enough of this attitude. I thought that you went on a vacation and you are coming back fresh we‚Äôre not going through this again. Please stop it for once let‚Äôs be happy family this situation is becoming toxic. I wish for us to be happy all of us.‚Äù
And I left the table I went to my room, close the door and just zoned out as usual . But 
 what I said was like poop in the bear. All hell broke loose, and I became the target of the.
I am a disrespectful b*** who supported my father and who got enough courage to speak to her this way, but didn‚Äôt defend her. 
Let‚Äôs just say, she was creative when she was cursing me. She came up twice tried to open the door found it closed. She kept on knocking and by the entrance just open the door what you want I said enough, and she kept on screaming at me pushing me trying to slap me. I‚Äôm not going to tell you what I said I didn‚Äôt curse her couldn‚Äôt do that, but I said that I‚Äôve had enough and that we could not carry on leaving this way and that the situation is becoming toxic. It felt like she‚Äôs not even listening. She took the keys of my room and she was like those are the locks I bought. Tried to get it back. She started pushing me and trying to bite me. So I tried to get the key and I bited  her to in her hand but I didn‚Äôt use force. Couldn‚Äôt get the key so I just grabbed the car key and was leaving. She got me by my hair and I told her to stop. I‚Äôm leaving. She was like‚Äù no before I do all I want to do‚Äù at this point my dad interfere he told me to go to my room and for her to stop at this point, he became the target. When I was going up ‚Äú I told her she should‚Äôve not come. She‚Äôs going to act this way.‚Äù 
Shaped on fighting with my father and every time she speaks to me, I would only say stop it enough enough . She said ‚Äú no since I am the bad one I‚Äôll make your life worse‚Äù. I just zoned out, I stop listening and speaking.
But I picked some, but she said; 
How dare I defend my father? How their eyes speak to her that way. That I am little b* and a s** . A worthless human in that she will make us miserable. And I will be the first one that she will get right off.‚Äù 

I don‚Äôt remember everything but I am done. I can‚Äôt live but I am not going to open my mouth again. Well at least I‚Äôm no more going to speak to her since what I said is usually used against me. This is not the first time it happened. I always decide to go mute but I couldn‚Äôt. Not gonna lie she‚Äôs my mother. 
But this is not the first time:
* 16 days from the death of my brother in an accident  she said to me ‚Äú dog‚Äôs life is long ‚Äú while fighting with me because I didn‚Äôt clean my room and u was not sad enough for my brother 
* Once again while fighting she said ‚Äú it should have been you ‚Äú
Those are the times I remember for know. Mind you I save my second brother from suicide when I was 6 years old and I was blamed for it.
And I grow up being responsible for my actions. All the treated like failure. And I‚Äôm always told that I‚Äôm not a good daughter. 
And by the way, the reason I‚Äôm not good at showing my emotions is because when I was 4 years old I was made fun of for crying after falling. So I stopped crying my tears will fall whene I am severally hurt but I will make no sound. I can‚Äôt describe how much I wish that I can show my emotions. I know where I can tell if I‚Äôm happy or not. I‚Äôm academically successful but I am not even proud for myself. 
I am hurt, and done.
What I wrote is a drop in a sea of misery. I became a uncapable of trusting people , of loving , of speaking.
There is no way out.
What to do ? I am broke, a full time student , the unemployment rate in my country is high. If you study you cannot work and if you work you cannot study. Let‚Äôs not speak about the payment that pays for nothing. Even freelancing is impossible because of the economic strategies of my country.

I am lost. I have two bachelor degrees and now I‚Äôm working on my master degree in international trade. I‚Äôm stuck and I see no way out. 
I am exhausted. And I don‚Äôt like the aggressive person. I‚Äôm becoming this is not me. 
My body hurts. My head hurts my heart. It feels like there is no place for me here as if the world is too small for me.

1o8cuw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1o8cuw5/my_wife_loves_going_out_i_dont/,"My wife loves going out, I don‚Äôt","Hey everyone,  
I‚Äôve been married for about half a year now, but my wife and I were engaged for around 3 years before that. Ever since we started dating one recurring issue keeps coming back - she loves going out and doing things, and I‚Äôm much more of a homebody.

During our engagement, we had a few arguments about it. I did try to take her out sometimes, but overall we didn‚Äôt go out as much as she wished. Now that we‚Äôre married the same issue is showing up again, just louder this time.

For some context: I work in construction, usually from 4AM to around 6PM. It‚Äôs physically exhausting, and on top of that I‚Äôm trying to study in the evenings to switch careers into the tech field. I graduated a year ago but couldn‚Äôt find a job yet because I spent a long time renovating our house before the wedding and got distracted from my job pursuation. I‚Äôm still paying off debt from that, so I‚Äôm working as many hours as I can because well consturction jobs at where i live pays a lot. I basically get one day off every two weeks, and even then, I use that time to rest, catch up on home chores, and study a bit.

My wife knows all of this and says she understands. She even budgets carefully and doesn‚Äôt ask for fancy dates or expensive restaurants. What she wants is simply to go out *somewhere* a beach walk, a picnic, coffee out just something to feel alive and connected. Her words.

The problem is unless she asks directly, it just doesn‚Äôt cross my mind to plan something. **I genuinely don‚Äôt think of it**. When she does ask (which makes her feel bad because to her im not thinking about her and her happiness) I‚Äôm often too tired or feel mentally drained, and the idea of going out after the long day i've had drains me. Then she bottles it up until she bursts and we have another argument about how I never plan dates and how this is a problem that keeps repeating itself between us over and over again. We‚Äôve probably had five or six fights about this in the last few months.

For example, yesterday was our 3-year engagement anniversary. I was late coming home from work but stopped to get her flowers. She‚Äôd hinted all week that she wanted to celebrate by going out somewhere, but I just couldn‚Äôt bring myself to do it after a 13-hour shift. She appreciated the flowers but was clearly disappointed we didn‚Äôt go anywhere. Today she‚Äôs been distant and told me she‚Äôs fine and going out with friends instead, and that I shouldn‚Äôt feel guilty.

The truth is that I really love her. On my days off and whenever i have time after work, I make her coffee in bed, clean around the house, cook or bring takeout when she‚Äôs tired, try to take care of her in all the small ways I can. But those things don‚Äôt replace what she‚Äôs missing, she thrives on *getting out* and I‚Äôm realizing that no amount of flowers or chores will fill that for her (she even said that herself).

I just don‚Äôt know how to balance everything. I‚Äôm tired, broke, trying to build a better future, and I genuinely have very little energy left after work. She says she‚Äôs tired of talking about this same issue and that she‚Äôs trying not to depend on me for her ‚Äúgoing out‚Äù needs anymore, but I can tell she‚Äôs sad about it.

I guess I‚Äôm here to ask:  
How do I handle this better? How can I show her love in the way she needs without burning myself out or making promises I can‚Äôt keep? Is there a middle ground for couples with different energy levels and love languages like this?",6,1760636503.0,Marriage,8,0.88,False

1o8cspf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1o8cspf/the_raven_outside/,The Raven Outside,"Mike stumbled into the security office as the heavy steel door slid shut behind him. A single emergency light bathed the room in a blood red light.

He pocketed his keycard and turned on his shoulderlamp. Shadows swayed as he scanned the room. A desk chair was turned over, papers were strewn across the floor, and the wire fence door separating the office from the small armory was ajar.

A strong metallic smell made him hesitate at the foot of the armory. The gun rack was almost empty aside from a single SPAS-12 and a couple ammo boxes. Nothing else seemed out of order. He grabbed the shotgun, extended the stock and loaded it carefully. His radio shrieked and he almost jumped out of his skin. Then Barney‚Äôs voice came through.

‚ÄúMikey, y‚Äôthere?‚Äù He asked, muffled by the static.

‚ÄúYou scared shit outta me, dude,‚Äù Mike breathed out.

‚ÄúHey, you gotta stay alert,‚Äù Barney replied, a smirk clear in his voice.

‚ÄúYeah, I guess‚Ä¶ Anyways, I got the gun.‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat. Now hurry up, I'm starting to‚Äì Wait a sec, I think I heard something.‚Äù

A long silence followed. It mustn't have been longer than thirty seconds, but it felt way longer than that.

‚ÄúBarney? What's going on?‚Äù

Barney shushed him, and a click echoed from the radio. Presumably his pistol's slide.

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs there?‚Äù Barney called out.

Barely audible through the static, a frail, frightened voice rasped out, ‚ÄúHel‚Äìlo‚Ä¶? Who a‚Ä¶are you?‚Äù

*Was that Jess?*

‚ÄúHey, it's okay,‚Äù Barney began, ‚ÄúI'm Barney, from Security. You're‚Ä¶ Jess? From bioengineering, right?‚Äù

No‚Ä¶ that couldn't be. Even through the static, the voice sounded a *little* too raspy to be her. For some reason, Mike couldn't shake off the image of that raven he befriended in his childhood.

‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù Jess repeated.

‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶‚Äù Barney trailed off, ‚ÄúAre you alri‚Äì?‚Äù

‚ÄúHelp.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh‚ÄìOkay, well‚Ä¶ uh, I'll be right back, Mikey.‚Äù 

‚ÄúBarney, wait!‚Äù Mike whisper-yelled as the signal cut.

‚ÄúDammit‚Ä¶‚Äù he muttered under his breath. He didn't want to go back without at least *some* company. This friggin‚Äô place was creepy with only emergency lights to illuminate everything. Also, he was getting a weird vibe from Jess. He'd talked to her this morning, and her voice didn't have that minuscule rasp from the radio. Sure, there was a bunch of static from the radio, plus everything that had gone down in the last hour or so, but still. 

Sighing, he turned to leave the armory, and the carpet squelched loudly under his boot.

He froze, and bent down to light the floor with his shoulderlamp.

Blood stains.

On the carpet.

Trailing out of the armory, and pooling behind a desk.

Mike had *no* interest in finding out what was back there.

There were also footprints ‚Äìtwice as big as his palms‚Äì with two long digits and a shorter one on the inside of the foot, backing up next to the trail and going out the door.

Under the card reader next to the door, lay another keycard. Stained with blood and seemingly bitten in one corner.

Just what the *fuck* did these people create down here?

Mike took a deep, shuddering breath. With trembling hands, he checked the shotgun's chamber, slipped his own keycard out of his pocket and opened the door.

Stepping outside, the footprints went down a dark hallway directly in front. To the right another, smaller hallway led to the break room.

Mike unmounted the lamp from his shoulder to better scan the wall in front of him. There were labeled arrows pointing to the restrooms, the break room to the right, the elevator to the left and‚Ä¶ *There!* The cafeteria! That's where Barney should be now. Mike would have to go through the break room first, and there he would hopefully be able to get his bearings.

Mike re-mounted the lamp on his shoulder, and walked rather quickly down the hallway, his steps echoing loudly into the darkness.

The break room wasn't in much better condition than the office. Again, chairs were flipped, random papers were scattered about on the floor, and a spilled coffee mug dripped onto the floor from a small coffee table. The only lights in the room were his headlamp, more emergency lights, and a dimly lit vending machine in one corner.

There was also the same metallic smell from the armory.

Then a hiss and a wet thud behind him.

Mike whipped around, shouldering the shotgun.

On the floor, just inside the cone of his light, lay a corpse. Its throat had been torn off and its face was bloodied and mangled by long bite marks, but that tattoo on his wrist was unmistakable.

It was Barney.

Mike wanted to puke.

And just outside the light of his lamp, barely lit by a red light behind it, stood a dark silhouette. Humanoid and taller than himself, with two bright spots for eyes.

Mike wanted to run, wanted to scream and blast that fucking thing or do *anything* but just *stand there*, trembling like a coward.

The creature lowered itself cautiously, now more at eye level.

Curiously, it tilted its head, like a dog, but with the quick and snappy movements of a bird.

Then it stepped forward.

All Mike could manage was a flinch and a pathetic gasp as a black, scaly, three-toed foot entered his light.

But oddly, he was again reminded of that raven from his childhood.

Sharp claws glinted in the light. Two of them scratched the ceramic tiles of the floor, and the other, much bigger and on the inner side of the foot, was raised a few inches.

Its black snout came into light, opening slowly, revealing a set of sharp bloodied fangs. Mike expected another hiss, or a roar, anything but‚Ä¶

‚ÄúHell‚Äì o‚Ä¶?‚Äù

Jess‚Äô voice.

Frail, frightened and only *just* too raspy to be her.

The thing was almost completely inside his light with another step.

Its bird-like body was covered almost entirely in dark feathers, starting behind its eyes, all the way to up the tip of its stiff long tail. Its feathering was so black it seemed to shine blue in the light of the lamp.

‚ÄúWh‚Ä¶ who,‚Äù the creature rasped, jaw and throat moving in tandem to replicate Jess‚Äô voice. Alarm bells rang inside his head as Mike was again reminded of that raven, sitting on the windowsill of his childhood room, pecking at peanuts in his hand.

‚ÄúA‚Äì a‚Äì are‚Ä¶‚Äù it croaked, as two, wing-like arms slowly stretched forwards, extending razor-sharp claws.

The alarm bells grew louder, and his brain demanded, screamed at his finger to budge, to pull the trigger.

The thing made a sharp, short sound, something between a caw and a roar.

Mike remembered how one night ‚Äìwhen he was a child‚Äì his mom's voice woke him up, telling him dinner was ready.

His finger had finally started to give in as a ceramic scratch rang out and another creature pounced down on him from behind. The shotgun clattered to the floor, and with a deafening blast, it punched a hole through the ceiling.

That night, he had gotten up from bed. When he was about to leave his bedroom, his mom called him again from behind. Turning around, he saw a dark silhouette standing on the windowsill, with two bright spots for eyes. The raven, mimicking his mom. It woke him up because it was hungry.

The blast seemed to deter the animals for a second, but before Mike could even move a muscle, a claw sunk into his back.

Pain shot up his spine and he screamed. He scratched at the floor, trying to get a hold of the shotgun, only managing to push it further away in his desperation.

The thing climbed on top of him, and something snapped under its crushing weight. He gasped for air and felt a humid, scorching hot breath on the back of his neck.

Mike had spoken to Jess this morning. He hadn't really been listening, only quietly admired her and her soft voice. But then she expressed her frustration at her colleagues for not listening, and still going through with using ravens to complete the DNA sequence.

They were smart, Jess had told him, they could mimic sounds better than most people expected, and Mike should've shot the damn thing the second he saw it.

Hissing, the beast surged forward, chomping down on his neck.",1,1760636368.0,Odd_directions,2,1.0,False

 i am a regular coffee drinker . i loved it. i used to drink 2 or 3 coffee a day .  sometimes i also drank energy drinks but without much coffee at same time. i always watched my limits. at some year . SVT was happening to me more often . when i changed my daily water source to a good filter. it was likely gone! i dunno how . it was like magic .  i also used to drink alcohol at bars at weekends . maybe sometimes i drank a lot! . without any single heart feeling of an issue!. okay couple of time got into SVT at night club . i sat down and calmed myself and bending over and breathing slowly then hold breath for seconds and it is gone each time! and i feel so good afterwards no problem !

 this year my anxiety ruined me . i dont know what happened with me or my body . lets explain first part of problem : i had dizzy spells and constant dizziness and head vibrations. i went to doctor and made **head CT, carotid artery ultrasound , Rheoencephalography of Cerebral Blood Vessels (REG)**.  f**irst two came out very clear . third one show some mild reduced blood flow or smth** . my **neurologist** told me i am all good . just anxiety and need to solve it .

 i started feeling good after anti anxiety med. till a day . i had big cup of coffee with milk from coffee machine at a cafe 400 ml . i was walking with my friend and **suddenly i got PVCs . two or 3 in a row . i was okay till i got  blurry vision . i panicked . i didnt faint or collapse** . i told my friend i am not good. i sat down and relaxed. okay i had huge energy drop for like 30 or 40 min . i drank water and returned good afterwards . no medical intervention or anything. i started having **cardiophobia** afterwards

 i went to cardiologist . made **echo and came out all is good with EF 69**. and made **Holter monitor 24h for first time of my life . here is results . normal sinus rhythm . no dangerous pauses. sinus arrhythmia , 8 PVC ( 6 isolated , 2 in pair) . ST segment elevation <1mm (early repolarization phenomenon ) .** 

my **cardiologist** told me not bad but i just felt she didnt even looked well at my reports. so , i want second opinion here . i am still resolving my anxiety with SSRIs and anti anxiety meds now. i have problem now **i cant workout well because of i feel i might die!** . i get little **PVCs during weightlifting**.  they terrify me!. i am still building muscles with those half workouts tho! i just feel not good because i dont see my big viens as wide as usual ! during weightlifting !. they always used to get wide during such activity! at random calm state at home they get normally !  is anxiety causing this? i want to get back to full potential!. 

also worth mentioning last SVT episode was 2 months ago. i was anxious and it was like hell! it was before i do the echo and holter by the way. what happened is i got SVT that didnt stop after 2 h ! it was longest ever for me i think. i called ambulance because i started getting dizzy! my bp was stable it was 128/80 i think. so  they came did me ECG . made me adenosine injection . i switched to sinus afterwards. I showed that ECG to cardiologist . told me looks like sinus tachy! but because it was sudden start then maybe SVT!

**when SVT happen for me it is always this order . PVC -> SVT -> PVC -> sinus rhythm  .** 

i made electrolyte analysis : 

**Magnesium (blood, photometry) 0.93 \[0.66 - 1.07\]**

**Sodium (Na+) (blood plasma) 138 \[136 - 145\]**

**Potassium (K+) (blood plasma) 4.0 \[3.5 - 5.1\]**

**Ionized Calcium 1.18 \[1.12 - 1.30\]**

my questions : 

1) am i at any risk of VT/VF or sudden death ?

2 ) can i take again Creatine? i stopped this year because i was afraid

3) can i take L citrullin ? is it good as i heard for heart?

4) taking these twos can i return with confidence to working out? what about my not widen viens in my arm? is my heart not pumping to my muscles as needed for some reason?

5) can i really drink coffee more than once a day? i limited it for my safety but i want just second cup ! can i go to that cafe and get that 400 ml coffee again? i want to break my fear! but i am afraid to die of some VT or smth

6) is my SVT dangerous ?

My university has an entire section for Deaf and HoH students. The building i line in is meant for those students because it's the closer to there school. I know very little ASL, I can finger spell slowly and I know a few basic words. But other than that, speaking is my main form of communication.
There's this girl on the same RA staff as me, she is HoH yet also doesn't when needed. Any time I talk to her it's a spoken conversation. If I'm being honest, I want to get to know more about her and I thought I'd ask of she wanted to get ice cream or coffee or something so we could hang out. The issue with this is 1, I don't want to invite her to someone that'll just be too taxing for her. Since I want to talk about life and stuff, yet I don't know enough ASL for a complex conversation like this, it would have to be a spoken conversation for the most part, which might be too taxing for her. And 2nd, I don't want things to get wired, since we're on the same RA staff I see her a fair amount and the last thing I need is for that to become a bad thing.
I see her alot around campus, we have similar makes so I'll see her in the buildings classes are in and we day help and chat for a little bit when we see each other. Idk we joke around to when we talk so we're definitely friendly and I don't think things would become wordt after a normal hangout (cuz that's all o wanna do, is just talk and get to know more about her. She genuinely does interest me, I'm just bad at talking to people out of the blue and usually need designated times so it doesn't feel awkward idk)
But yeah I don't know that to do.

So, how can I make my game be seen?

Also, for these social media profiles should I just use my name or can I create a brand name like \[Something\] Games or whatever? Would it get me legal problems down the line?

I just moved to North Miami two months ago. I am a big musiclover, shows, festivals, etc. 

So naturally when I found out about IllPoints here, I made it my intention to go. 

I made the mistake of not buying the tickets when they were significantly cheaper. I just had moved here and I didn‚Äôt want to spend my budget on that right away. But now, looking back, that was nothing compared to prices now üòÇ. Oh well, lesson learned :)

While I‚Äôd love to go both days. I am also intentional about just a Saturday-day-pass. (I‚Äôm really here for Black Coffee!!!!!!! And of course many others but I‚Äôve realllly been wanting to see him live. It would be life changing for me I think lol. ). 

Now a single day pass is $350 after tax? And almost sold out nonetheless. 

I‚Äôm just wondering if any Miami locals, or anyone whose had experience with this fest, might know what the best way might be to buy re-sell tickets; that‚Äôs also obviously not going to end up being a scam. 

I know the first couple of years when I went to Electric Forest in MI (hometown), there was alwayyyys people out trying to sell tickets at the entrance. 

I‚Äôm wondering if that could be a thing here too? 
At this point, I‚Äôd even be willing to do peep that out too because this is how bad I need to be at this event. 

I‚Äôm holding high hopes. I really need this right now. Moving here has been a bit of a struggle, stressful, as is typical, but I fucking need to go to this. I know, I feel, it will bring me back to life. 

Sorry for venting now and getting emotional üòÇüòÇ. I just need to dance!!! 

Thanks for any responses.

We started meeting after work almost daily, going for food, exchanging texts and gradually becoming more and more closer every day.

She was open from the start, she was diagnosed with bipolar in 2023 after an episode, I think she said experiencing mixed features. She‚Äôs had multiple partners before meeting, many bad experiences but now being on medication she‚Äôs over that and going to take things slowly. I wasn‚Äôt ready to jump into a relationship but I knew from the start I liked her a lot so both in agreement we‚Äôd go at a pace that suited both. 

We were both happy and comfortable with each other‚Äôs company, soon becoming exclusive then official. We‚Äôd always be happy together, if ever she felt overwhelmed or wanted her own space and felt the need to cancel I was happy to do so and rearrange. I‚Äôd do everything in my power to make her happy, drop in coffee at work, meet her after to go out or just chill at hers and make dinner. It felt right.

I had a family holiday in September so was away from her but we still remained in contact, I‚Äôd purposely wake up early because of the time difference just to wish her a good day because I‚Äôd do that without fail. We had a late night call after she was on a night out when she said she loved me as we were closing the call (I was shocked and asked what she said (the feeling was mutual) but she went quiet and that was the end of the call) 

I struggle with saying how I feel and I‚Äôve been trying to bring this up since being back. Recently she‚Äôs had a couple of days where she‚Äôs felt worthless and obviously I reassure but something has been off. We had a disagreement a couple of weeks ago where I didn‚Äôt sleep and I passed off and said I felt fine, she didn‚Äôt talk to me after that and felt awkward. We met up a few days later and it felt like nothing had happened. She has forgotten to take her meds but will never go more than 2 days without it.

Anyway, last Friday we went out to a gathering where I hadn‚Äôt seen people for a number of years and without realising at the time I neglected her, we later had a big argument and I apologised for everything but shouted at her for leaving. We didn‚Äôt talk on Saturday but met on Sunday where she said it‚Äôs over after almost 6 months, giving me back clothes and dismissing my apologies again. I finally brought up the call and her saying she loves me, saying that back to her before she said she didn‚Äôt remember what she said when she was drunk. We walked off, she hugged me but oddly said she doesn‚Äôt hate me as we departed.

I‚Äôm devastated, I‚Äôve not eaten much this week, I‚Äôve thought about her nonstop whilst trying to educate myself more on bipolar. I know sudden choices and decisions will be made and she‚Äôs had things happen before so probably has a short fuse with things like this but I was always told this is different, I‚Äôm not like others. I don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôs having or in an episode, I don‚Äôt know the signs but I‚Äôm so sad and worried and I miss her so much I can‚Äôt put into words.

I‚Äôm giving her space, I‚Äôve written out a heartfelt apology, being direct, showing remorse and accountability whilst making her feel special. I don‚Äôt know if to send it, I really don‚Äôt want to lose her, we‚Äôve done so much these past 6 months and as much as I‚Äôve tried my hardest to make her happy I believe she‚Äôs felt that way towards me.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Maple Leafs vs. Rangers: A Same-Game Parlay for the Ages**

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a hockey clash that‚Äôs equal parts *‚Äúwill they, won‚Äôt they?‚Äù* and *‚Äúhere‚Äôs hoping the puck doesn‚Äôt get lost in the net.‚Äù* The Toronto Maple Leafs (-155) host the New York Rangers (+129) on October 16, 2025, in a game that‚Äôs as much about math as it is about mayhem. Let‚Äôs break it down with the precision of a Zamboni and the humor of a deflated air horn.

---

### Parse the Odds: A Numbers Game

The Maple Leafs are favored to win outright (-155), implying a 61.2% chance of victory. For context, that‚Äôs like betting your favorite coffee shop will run out of oat milk latte foam today‚Äîinevitable, but still somehow shocking. The Rangers (+129) offer a 43.8% implied probability, which is about the same chance your neighbor‚Äôs dog will finally learn to stop barking at squirrels.

The puck line tells a wilder story: Toronto is a 1.5-goal favorite (-1.5), with a hefty price tag (2.8 odds), while New York (+1.5) is a long shot at 1.45. Meanwhile, the total goals line sits at 6.5, with the *Under* priced more attractively (1.8‚Äì2.1 odds) than the Over (1.77‚Äì1.99). Historically, these teams allowed 5.9 goals per game last season‚Äîjust *0.1* under the current Over/Under. That‚Äôs like betting your kid will eat one more bite of broccoli before bedtime. Close, but not *quite*.

---

### Digest the News: Injuries, Comebacks, and a Dog on a Bone

Toronto‚Äôs news is a mixed bag of ‚Äúmeh‚Äù and ‚Äúmeh, but also meh.‚Äù Key injuries include Joseph Woll (out), Steven Lorentz (out), and Marshall Rifai (out). But fear not! Anthony Stolarz returns in net, boasting a 2.41 GAA against the Rangers in his career. Think of him as the hockey version of a trusty old umbrella‚Äînot flashy, but reliable when it rains. Defenseman Easton Cowan, meanwhile, is ‚Äúa dog on a bone‚Äù per coach Craig Berube, which is hockey-speak for ‚Äúthis guy won‚Äôt stop gnawing at the opposition‚Äôs morale.‚Äù

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Toronto Maple Leafs vs. New York Rangers: A Defensive Showdown or a Goal Fest?**

Ladies and gentlemen, grab your popcorn and your mittens‚Äîit‚Äôs hockey time! The Toronto Maple Leafs, fresh off a 7-4 ‚ÄúI‚Äôll-have-another-slice-of-pizza‚Äù performance against the Nashville Predators, host the New York Rangers in a clash that‚Äôs as much about math as it is about muscle. Let‚Äôs break this down like a Zamboni on a caffeine buzz.

---

### Odds & Stats: The Numbers Don‚Äôt Lie (Mostly)

The Maple Leafs are favored at **-155** (implied probability: \~60.6%), while the Rangers sit at **+129** (\~43.5%). The puck line has Toronto as **-1.5 goals** (decimal odds \~2.75-2.85), and the total goals line is **6.5**, with the **Under** priced slightly more favorably across books.

Key stats? Oh, there‚Äôs plenty. Toronto‚Äôs defense, which has been the NHL‚Äôs version of a sieve for years, somehow managed to *score two goals* last game. Coach Craig Berube called it ‚Äúa miracle in skates,‚Äù and honestly, we‚Äôre not arguing. Anthony Stolarz, the Leafs‚Äô netminder, has a **2.41 GAA** against the Rangers in his career, which is better than his 3.05 season average. Meanwhile, Igor Shesterkin of the Rangers has a **0.8 GAA** this season‚Äîthough that‚Äôs probably just a typo; even he can‚Äôt be that good.

---

### Injury Report: Who‚Äôs Tripping Over Whose Shoelaces?

Toronto‚Äôs injury list reads like a cast of *The Office* on a coffee break: **Joseph Woll**, **Steven Lorentz**, and **Marshall Rifai** are out, but at least **Easton Cowan** is sticking around like a particularly persistent ad. Coach Berube praised Cowan as ‚Äúa dog on a bone,‚Äù which is hockey-speak for ‚Äúthis guy‚Äôs so eager, he‚Äôd chase a puck into a wall.‚Äù

On the Rangers‚Äô side, **Vincent Trocheck** and **Carson Soucy** are sidelined, which is bad news for New York‚Äôs defense. Without them, the Rangers‚Äô vaunted ‚Äúsecond-best defense in the league‚Äù (per last season‚Äôs stats) might look more like a group of accountants trying to juggle.

I went alone as one does. Took 10mg edible in the parking lot, walked right to the bar hesitantly ordered an old fashioned. Drank that while in line and asked a cute girl ahead of me to hold my spot, I walked around nervously topped off my drink with ice and went back to line. That‚Äôs when I saw the raddest guys at the concert smoking cigarettes bouncing on the hand rail. Loud, genuinely unique in a crowd of people vying to be unique. Splashing in the puddles like little boys without a care in the world. I walked up a said hey bevis and butthead give me one of those cigarettes, Crow had two left and offered one I said I‚Äôll just finish yours and he handed it over to me. It was on. Let‚Äôs get a beer I said he seemed hesitant, it‚Äôs on me I said for the cigarette. It was on and we‚Äôre off! I had a friend. Creek said yea go grab a beer we‚Äôll be here, throughout the night they would check in with eachother like that, it must be nice having a brother. I‚Äôm crying now FUCK. 4th wall. We walked towards the bar jokingly. I asked how old are you, 24 he said, your wristband says your 21 lol how old are you? Like 33? God bless you bro thank you! wtf your older than that? IM 41. no way!! I can‚Äôt be hanging out with some grandpa! Fuck you!! the soccer game was on at the bar you follow soccer I asked? yeah he said. I don‚Äôt follow anything I responded, but I did know one thing like the back of my hand and that‚Äôs peach pit songs :) we walked back to line and lit another cigarette I don‚Äôt wanna smoke your last one I said he said go for it bro like he knew I needed it. I got this vape üí® pen if you wanna hit it? Like a dab pen he asked? no but it‚Äôs the good ones like full spectrum deal, we call em dabs grandpa.. either way he passed but when we found Creek and his girlfriend (I don‚Äôt remember her name but she seemed sweet and attached to him the whole time) he asked yo can my brother hit your pen üñäÔ∏è fo sho and I happily passed it. glad to have something to offer. We cracked jokes, talked shit as I noticed everyone around us looking out of the corner of there eyes. I love a motley crew like this :) Crow‚Äôs earrings were dope! Made of spine bones from a baby snake üêç where‚Äôd you get those I asked. A girl I‚Äôm talking to made them for me. Fuck she‚Äôs a keeper bro that‚Äôs cool as fuck is she your girlfriend? No. Creek jumps in ‚Äúhe‚Äôs scared‚Äù don‚Äôt be I said love is an amazing thing bro as I thought about the pain and joy it brought me over the years. I was definitely the wise elder amongst them and I like that. As we went in I fumbled my phone for my ticket and they went ahead. I followed but lost them Fuck! I wondered around for a few checking the vibe and ran into them upstairs at the merch table. Yo! There you are! They said. Acceptance. What are you getting? Merch! I regret not getting a shirt.. Let‚Äôs get a beer I said and we‚Äôre off to the bar as Creek and his girlfriend waited for shirts. I regret not getting one but had a one track mind at that point get fucked up and let the fun continue. We head to the bar upstairs and Crow had to piss, earlier he mentioned he only has one kidney. When he told me previously I was ready to give him another already on the spot, he said he wouldn‚Äôt want a second one because of all the shit you have to go though from surgery. He goes to the pisser I wonder around looking off the balcony at the women, lord help me and when he comes back out I see him across the bar looking for me. It feels good to be looked for. I sped walked over. You order beers he asked no I was waiting for you. What are you having? Ummm he waits for me to order. He seems to not wanna order anything that cost more than what I get. I‚Äôll go with another Modelo and he says I‚Äôll take the same with a lime? Yeah. Me too. He asked for a selcer? ( how the fuck do you even spell that? I‚Äôm so off the auto correct wont fix it.. never had one) it‚Äôs for creeks girl. Go for it I said he said dude I feel bad letting  you buy me beer I responded like an arrogant ass. I made $3500 today let‚Äôs have fun. Doing what he asked ? I‚Äôm a contractor we do painting. No shit we paint too and do other handy man shit. Bro I‚Äôm so busy I‚Äôll get you guys some work if you‚Äôll drive to Tampa. Really? Fuck yeah? It pays good too I responded. These are all half lies or truths. When I drink the lines get blurry. I have five employees and I could and I do but the truth is I haven‚Äôt been that busy. I hit a couple home runs a month and if not a winner I‚Äôd rather not work and wait for the next good job. We walked down to find creek and it‚Äôs a great spot left back by the steps. He secretly hands creeks girl the seltzer (got it) is she not 21 I asked ? he said no. Oh ok cool. (Ive been drinking and doin drugs since I was 12 side note) no big deal to me. We joke we laugh we fuck around and almost immediately girls start flocking one after another the vibe was strong with these guys and I‚Äôm an attention hungry man who‚Äôre myself. Hey, hi, :) hello, how are you, excuse me, I‚Äôm sorry,  all of the people passing said I‚Äôm sorry and it was annoying I started saying I‚Äôm sorry to with different additives for each one, for your loss, for everything I did as a kid, for the stain on your shirt, for the herpes, for it all. (It‚Äôs 6:30 am so I have to take a break and get my daughter ready for school but I want to keep writing I don‚Äôt know why this resonates with me so much but I‚Äôll be back) actually I‚Äôm gonna take a shit before I wake her up and start the oven for beacon. I have morning ritual for shitting that used to start with coffee but I‚Äôm on a caffeine break and writing has relaxed me enough today to get it going. So I set up a step stool like a squatty potty, get my space heater going, I hate cold poops and grab my phone. Usually it‚Äôs the news but today it‚Äôs this. I think I‚Äôm enjoying this, maybe something good could come from all this angst. My dreams wake me up lately with the quitting weed although I did take a 5mg gummy yesterday while at Disney with my daughter so not fully sober but it makes them intense. Alright it wipes its ass washes its hands and puts the greenwise beacon in before waking the baby. She‚Äôs six but still my baby and other beacon has so many additives. this is beacon and seasoning.  Our morning went perfect and drop off was right on time she‚Äôs such a precious soul and I‚Äôm blessed to have her. Crow if you read this I know it‚Äôs weird but your energy could take you anywhere my friend and your brotherhood with Creek is beautiful. Alright back to the story, It‚Äôs ironic how the earrings a girl makes you attracts other girls. Not to mention looking like a cross between post Malone and Brad Pitt yikes! I was going through pussy withdrawal since I hadn‚Äôt fucked in weeks and lately decided to retain my chi for whatever reasons. As Chris floated across the stage the girls kept passing through all with something to say to either one of us. I was already too fucked up to fuck but enjoyed the flirting. Not as much as I was enjoying my favorite band and good company from everyone around me singing every song as if I was alone in my truck. I felt a tap on my shoulder and it was the cutie that held my spot in line! Holly shit I said it‚Äôs you! It‚Äôs me she said with a smirk. Wow this feels meant to be! She smiles x as the songs transition into silence. You know who you look like ? Who she said. The guitarist from wet leg, Hester chambers. She says I don‚Äôt know wet leg.. I say lemme show you and I gave it a goog she looks and says I‚Äôll accept that. She was a younger version as Hester has some life experience in her eyes so I said maybe you at thirty?! She was probably 25 ( I‚Äôve always been attracted to younger women, life / men haven‚Äôt  beat them down yet and the optimism is contagious. Ahh to be 25))PP starts outa here and I go nuts that shit fucks so hard just like every other song. I‚Äôm in the zone bouncing, swingin singing and decide to take a video. I don‚Äôt do social media so it‚Äôs just for me to recollect later. At this point I‚Äôm fucked up bad, grab the vape out of my pocket and take a giant rip. As I exhale another hottie with glasses is looking me in the eye üëÅÔ∏è what‚Äôs your name she says? I respond laughing as Crow watches me my names -$;:&18 I‚Äôm old as fuck I have a six year old and am a Gemini I say hilariously like a dating profile she laughs and could probably tell I was wasted so goes back to gawking over Crow and I smile like a proud papa. At this point I could care less about getting laid, I was in heaven. I look around as the song wraps up at all of ‚Äúmy people‚Äù it felt so good to see so many people love the music I‚Äôve loved for seven years or so. I felt like a proud parent and probably could be. It‚Äôs weird that ‚Äúmy people‚Äù are all in there twenties but I still don‚Äôt wanna grow up and feel perpetually 27. Crow has to piss again, I say grab us some beers and hand him my credit card. I turn around to Hester and we look at eachother.. I say I‚Äôm not, you know hitting on you who knows where that could go she relays the message to her friend covering  her mouth and they giggle. The music goes on and I keep boppin. I get another tap on the shoulder and in comes my fourth tall boy Modelo with lime üçã‚Äçüü© thanks bro! Here‚Äôs your card. And we cheers! I fucking love this shit!! Everyone around me loves it too! I grab my phone and quickly book the Disney springs holiday inn because I‚Äôm hammered and know I can‚Äôt drive home but also think these two short sixes have been smiling at me all night I bet I could have both of them I thought arrogantly.. we flirt a little and I‚Äôm sure of it.. This is when it all goes bad.. a guy squeezed by me and says I need to get down there so I let him pass but he doesn‚Äôt pass. He gets right next/ to me a whips his phone out to record shampoo bottles. Great song, I was wearing a pp shirt a few days ago at a coffee shop when the barista says I love peach pit! I emphasized mee too!! She asked are you going to the show Monday ? I said I am now, and that I rarely meet anyone in the wild that likes pp! She said really? I love shampoo bottles and ask for my insta I responded like usual with I‚Äôve been offline for years hmmmm what‚Äôs your phone number then she asked? And we exchange numbers she text hi. I skated off with my green tea and stop on a bench to buy my ticket, singular. I‚Äôve been single for awhile. I‚Äôd love to fall in love and have been searching with no luck for a lifetime. I‚Äôve never married or felt strong enough to know I want to be with someone forever. I was with my daughter‚Äôs mother for eight years and she‚Äôs a kind beautiful person but we grew apart. One day I was super depressed and crying over hot knifer. That day she recorded a rendition and sent it to me it was beautiful I‚Äôll never forget that. It was cool to meet the barista as that was my info for the show I text her back hi ;) just got my ticket‚Ä¶. When you‚Äôre not online you miss out on things but when life puts them into your existence it hits way harder and feels it has meaning. The day of the show I text her and say thanks for telling me about it I‚Äôm super stoked but forgot to save your name in my phone. as I was so PP‚Äôd out. She never responded and I don‚Äôt see her at the show btw. Kinda thought it was something but that‚Äôs just me, I romanticize and create sentimate for the littlest interactions as I said they hit harder. So back to the douche! It was probably just the alcohol but I was annoyed üòí he‚Äôs recording everything instead of enjoying it and I don‚Äôt wanna watch the show through his phone so I say hey bro you said you were passing by earlier and cramped my spot so why don‚Äôt you go on by?! He responded with naw I‚Äôm good but you could go as he continues recording not singing along at all probably just a casual fan and in hind sight that‚Äôs great! And I‚Äôm sorry for the interaction now but I was pissed in the moment. I visioned punching him in the face or shoving him off the step! I pictured my new friends helping me stomp his ass with there cowboy boots and then I walked away. I need water I thought and slid passed Hester. ( It‚Äôs 6:30 am day two of this and I‚Äôm gonna go to hot yoga then come back to this, I don‚Äôt have my daughter today she‚Äôs with her mom. Last night she text we love you and I responded I love you too. It always feels weird but I do still love her I‚Äôm just not in love anymore) 10:18 pm EDM show, not my vibe so much but still dope.  I‚Äôm fucked up again‚Ä¶ went to Corn n pencil for dinner and had two whiskeys with a lot of ice. Walked to the venue, edm show in here feels like setup or something.., better only bring the essentials. I saw I girl from hot yoga :) now we know each other‚Äôs other sides ;) nah idk she‚Äôs not really my type. As I smoke an organic cigarette on the patio the DJ walked outside and I said simply good job. I layed on the table feeling great. I‚Äôm so glad I got an uber tonight it gives me freedom to do as I please and the cute driver gave me her number incase I wanted a ‚Äúride‚Äù later on.. I took that as a innuendo. The DJ asked to take a picture with me that‚Äôs cool and I had an artist draw my picture inside they were really good I honestly am unsure of their original gender, it dosesnt matter. Lots in between but I walked in Cobb n penn were closed! Worker yells at his girlfriend as she goes to the car sara! Sara! I‚Äôll kill you! You better not she slams the door he‚Äôd probably really kill her‚Ä¶.
I‚Äôve had way too many cigarettes tonight. Back to the PP story, I stumbled to my truck and sat there for what felt like an hour. I had every intention of driving 1 mile to the hotel but instinctively started driving home like an idiot I hind sight. I was mad that I left without saying goodbye, I had hoped to meet ‚Äúmy girl‚Äù there not the barista but one that likes pp as much as me. I barely remember the drive, I listened to Her‚Äôs what once was on repeat as I recalled the show and thought how horrible it is to drive drunk as that‚Äôs how Stephen, Audun and Trevor were taken from us. I missed Neil‚Äôs solo and private presley and the after show excitement to share with everyone around me. The next afternoon I called Crow and we chatted a bit. Where‚Äôd you go off to? I was in my head bro, yeah you seemed in your head. Embarrassingly I responded fuck youuuuuu we talked for a few minutes and agreed to hangout sometime. I texted a week later to see if they were down for the turnstile concert in Orlando coming up to get no response. My drinking has gotten in the way of several potential friendships and relationships but it‚Äôs what makes me courageous enough to create them. I‚Äôll never know what peach pit sober would have been like. Maybe next time. My recommendation to anyone thinking about going to concerts alone is to quote the late great Hunter S Thompson ‚Äúbuy the ticket, take the ride‚Äù. 

All names have been altered to protect the guilty. 

I‚Äôd like to see Hester again. Just putting that into the universe.

I think they both work fairly decent, but to be honest, I think I prefer using them without pressing and flexing the nib too much lol

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a Thursday night clash that‚Äôs less *Monday Night Football* and more *Monday Afternoon Nap*. The Tulsa Golden Hurricane (2-4, 0-3 AAC) and East Carolina Pirates (3-3, 1-1) are set to battle in a game that‚Äôs statistically more likely to end with a team scoring a field goal and then sitting in the locker room texting ‚ÄúNBD‚Äù than anything resembling an offensive explosion. Let‚Äôs break this down with the precision of a spreadsheet and the humor of a dad joke.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Tale of Two Sieves

First, the numbers: East Carolina is a **-800** favorite on the moneyline, implying bookmakers think they‚Äôve got an 89% chance to win. Tulsa‚Äôs **+575** line suggests they‚Äôre seen as a 15% shot‚Äîabout the same odds as me correctly spelling ‚Äúdefensively dominant‚Äù after one cup of coffee. The spread is **ECU -16.5**, a line so steep it makes the Alps look like a speed bump. Historically, Tulsa has covered the spread in 6 of their last 7 meetings with ECU, but let‚Äôs be real: this spread is the football equivalent of a ‚ÄúYou have 16.5 seconds to score or we‚Äôre all going home‚Äù ultimatum.

The total is **54.5**, with the Under favored at **-115**. Why? Because both teams have combined to hit the Under in **9 of their last 11 games**. Tulsa‚Äôs offense? A leaky faucet. They managed **71 rushing yards** and **175 passing yards** in a 45-7 loss to Memphis. ECU‚Äôs quarterback, Katin Houser, threw for 180 yards and a TD last week but also relies on a running game that‚Äôs about as consistent as a toddler‚Äôs attention span.

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Trends, and Why This Feels Familiar

Tulsa‚Äôs QB, Kirk Francis, has been a turnover machine, throwing **3 interceptions** and losing **4 fumbles** in their last game. His stat line reads like a cautionary tale for football players: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt trip over your own feet, Kirk!‚Äù Meanwhile, ECU‚Äôs defense has allowed **6 or fewer points in 3 of their last 5 games**, including a 26-19 home win over Tulane.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Tulsa vs. East Carolina: A Defensive Duel with a Side of Desperation**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a gridiron clash that‚Äôs less *Monday Night Football* and more *Monday Morning Coffee*‚Äîbitter, low on caffeine, and best served with a side of underwhelming scores. The Tulsa Golden Hurricane (2-4, 0-3 AAC) and East Carolina Pirates (3-3, 1-1) meet in Greenville, North Carolina, where the air is humid, the defenses are stout, and the offenses‚Ä¶ well, let‚Äôs just say they‚Äôre auditioning for a role in *The Blair Witch Project* (i.e., lost and found).

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Tale of Two Turnovers

Let‚Äôs start with the numbers, because even a blind squirrel can occasionally find an acorn.

* **Tulsa** is a mess offensively. Last week, they were shredded 45-7 by Memphis, managing a combined 246 yards and four turnovers. Their QB, Kirk Francis, looks like he‚Äôs playing chess against a room full of rooks‚Äîthree picks, four fumbles, and zero answers. Defensively, they‚Äôre slightly better, allowing 26.3 PPG, but their porous run defense (181.2 YPG) might get exposed by ECU‚Äôs patchwork rushing attack.
* **East Carolina**, meanwhile, is a team of contradictions. They lost to Tulane in a thriller that would‚Äôve made Shakespeare weep, but their defense has been a fortress at home, allowing 20.0 PPG and six or fewer points in three of their last five games. QB Katin Houser isn‚Äôt a magician, but he‚Äôs a capable card-flipper, mixing 180-yard games with the occasional dud.

The **implied probabilities** from the odds tell a story of stark imbalance:

* **East Carolina -800** implies a 88.9% chance to win. That‚Äôs the statistical equivalent of betting on the sun to rise tomorrow.
* **Tulsa +575** suggests a 15.1% win probability‚Äîa mathematically sound bet if you enjoy watching your money evaporate like ice in a sauna.

The **spread** (-16.5 for ECU) is a reality check for Tulsa, which has covered the ATS in 6 of its last 7 meetings with ECU. But let‚Äôs be real: Covering the spread in this game is like trying to herd cats in a hurricane.

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Inconsistencies, and a Dash of Drama

Tulsa‚Äôs woes are as predictable as a broken clock. QB Kirk Francis is playing with the confidence of a man who just remembered he forgot to pay his taxes. The offense? A symphony of missed opportunities, with a rushing attack that‚Äôs slower than a sloth on a treadmill. Their lone‰∫ÆÁÇπ?

I met this guy, early 30s, on a dating app.  I swiped yes because he was looking for something long term. We talked for 3 weeks, and he suggested to meet. On the app I was the one initiating conversation and pretty much asking so many questions but barely got any back. Decided to meet him to see if it was worth pursuing.  The day of the date no plan was discussed. I messaged him to see if he was still up for it, he said yes but no plan on what we will be doing. I ended up finding a coffee shop we could go. I thought the date went bad, because I got super nervous and my mind went black multiple times, but the following day he suggested to meet again. I said sure. 

We decided to meet the following weekend. Between the date he asked me and the date of the second date he didn't reach out to even discuss what we could do or what time to meet. The day of the second date comes, and still nothing. So, I ended up cancelling on the day because 1. I felt he was not that interested and 2 something came up.  He took it well. I asked if he was open to meet instead the following weekend. He said yes and this time came up with an activity to do. However, we're supposed to meet tomorrow, and he hasn't reached out yet. 

I feel he's not that into me. Am I right? I feel I need to remind him we're meeting every time. But I don't want to be seen as needy. This is the first guy I've meet outside the apps, and as someone who doesn't have any romantic experience, I am not sure if I am overreacting.",1,1760635340.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

Welcome back for Part Two¬†of¬†this series. If you happen to be new here, feel free¬†to check out Part One before¬†continuing.¬†

So, last¬†week we¬†read the cold open to¬†*ASILI*,¬†which sets the tone nicely for what you¬†can¬†expect from¬†this story.¬†This week,¬†we‚Äôll¬†finally be¬†introduced to our main characters: the American activists, and of course, Henry himself.¬†

Like I mentioned last¬†time,¬†I‚Äôll¬†be¬†omitting¬†a¬†handful¬†of scenes here ‚Äì not only because¬†of some pretty cringe dialogue, but because...¬†you‚Äôre¬†only¬†really here¬†for the horror, right? And the quicker we get to it, or at least, the adventure part of the story, the better!¬†

Before we start things off¬†here,¬†I just need to repeat something from last week in case anyone forgets...¬†¬†

This screenplay, although fictitious, is an¬†adaptation of a real-life story¬†‚Äì a very faithful¬†adaptation¬†I might add.¬†The characters in this script¬†were real people¬†-¬†as were the horrific things which happened¬†to them.¬†

Well, without any further ado,¬†let‚Äôs¬†carry on¬†with¬†Henry‚Äôs¬†story\]¬†

**EXT. BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS - STREETS - AFTERNOON**¬†¬†¬†

FADE IN:¬†¬†

We leave the mass of endless jungle for a mass gathering of¬†civilization...¬†¬†

A long BOSTON STREET. Filled completely with PROTESTING PEOPLE. Most wear¬†masks¬†(deep into¬†pandemic). The¬†protestors¬†CHANT:¬†¬†¬†

PROTESTORS: BLACK LIVES MATTER! BLACK LIVES MATTER!...¬†¬†¬†

Almost everyone¬†holds or waves¬†signs¬†- they read: 'BLM','I CAN'T BREATHE', 'JUSTICE NOW!', etc.¬†POLICEMEN¬†keep the peace.¬†¬†

Among the crowd:¬†¬†

A¬†GROUP of SIX PROTESTORS. THREE MEN and THREE WOMEN (all BLACK, early to mid-20's). Two hold up a BANNER,¬†which¬†reads: 'B.A.D.S.: Blood-hood of African Descendants and¬†Sympathizers'.¬†

Among these six are:¬†¬†¬†

MOSES.¬†African-American. Tall and lean. A gold cross necklace around his neck. The loudest by far - clearly wants to make a statement. A leadership quality to him.¬†¬†¬†

TYE LOUIN.¬†Mixed-race. Handsome. Thin. One of the two holding the banner. Distinctive of his¬†neck-length dreadlocks.¬†¬†¬†

NADI¬†HASSAN. A pleasant looking, beautiful young woman. Short-statured¬†and model thin.¬†She takes part in the chanting alongside the others - when:¬†¬†¬†

RING¬†RING¬†RING.¬†¬†

Nadi receives a PHONE CALL. Takes out her¬†iPhone¬†and pulls down her mask. Answers:¬†¬†

NADI: (on phone) (raises voice) HELLO?¬†¬†¬†

She struggles to hear the other end.¬†¬†¬†

NADI (CONT'D): (London accent) Henry? Is that you?¬†¬†

The girl next to her¬†inquires in: CHANTAL CLEMMONS. Long hair. Well dressed.¬†¬†¬†

CHANTAL: Have you told him?¬†¬†¬†

Nadi shakes a glimpsing 'No'. Tye looks back to them - eavesdrops.¬†¬†¬†

NADI: (loudly) Henry, I¬†can't¬†hear you.¬†I'm¬†at a rally -¬†you'll¬†have to shout...¬†¬†¬†

INTERCUT WITH:¬†¬†

**INT. HENRY'S FLAT - NORTH LONDON - NIGHT - SAME TIME**¬†¬†¬†¬†

HENRY: (on phone) ...I said,¬†I was at the BLM rally in the park today. You know, the one I was talking to you about?¬†¬†¬†

HENRY¬†CARTWRIGHT. Early 20's. Caucasian. Brown hair. Not exactly tall or¬†muscular, yet¬†possesses that unintentional bad boy persona girls weaken for - to¬†accompany¬†his deep BLUE EYES. In the kitchen of a SMALL NORTH-LONDON FLAT, he glows on the other end.¬†¬†

BACK TO:¬†¬†¬†

Nadi. The noise around takes up the scene.¬†¬†¬†

NADI: (on phone) Henry, seriously - I¬†can't¬†hear a single word¬†you're¬†saying. Look, how about we chat tomorrow,¬†yeah? Henry?¬†¬†¬†

HENRY: (on phone) ...Yeah.¬†Alright¬†- what time do you want me to call-¬†¬†

NADI: (hangs up) -Ok. Got to go!¬†

HENRY: (on phone) Yeah - bye! Love y-¬†¬†

Henry looks to his¬†phone.¬†Lets¬†out a sigh of defeat - before carelessly dumps the phone on the table. Slumps down into a chair.¬†¬†¬†

HENRY (CONT'D): (to himself) ...Fuck.¬†¬†¬†

Henry looks over at the chair opposite him. A RALLY SIGN lies against it. The sign reads:¬†¬†¬†

'LOVE HAS NO COLOUR'¬†

**INT. BOSTON CAFE - LATER THAT DAY**¬†¬†¬†¬†

At a table, the exhausted B.A.D.S.¬†sit in a HALF-EMPTY CAFE (people still protest outside). An awkwardness hangs over them. The TV above the¬†counter¬†displays the NEWS.¬†¬†¬†

NEWS WOMAN: ...I know the main debates of this time are¬†equal¬†rights¬†and,¬†of course,¬†the pandemic - but we¬†cannot¬†hide from the facts: global warming is at an¬†all-time¬†high! Even with the huge decrease in air travel and manufacture of certain automobiles, one thing that has not decreased is¬†deforestation...¬†¬†¬†

MOSES: (to B.A.D.S.)¬†That's¬†it...¬†That's¬†all we can do... for now.¬†¬†¬†

A WAITRESS comes over...¬†¬†¬†

MOSES (CONT'D): (to¬†waitress) Uhm... Yeah - six coffees... (before she goes) But, I have mine black. Thanks.¬†¬†¬†

The¬†waitress¬†walks away. Moses checks her out before turns back to the group.¬†¬†

MOSES (CONT'D): At least NOW... we can focus on what really matters. On how¬†we're¬†truly¬†gonna¬†make a difference in this world...¬†¬†¬†

No reply. Everyone looks down as to avoid Moses' eyes.¬†¬†¬†

MOSES (CONT'D): How we all feel 'bout that?¬†¬†¬†

The members look to each other - wonder who will go first...¬†¬†

CHANTAL: (to Moses) I¬†dunno...¬†It's¬†just feeling...¬†real¬†all'er¬†sudden. (to group) Right?¬†¬†¬†

MOSES: (ignores Chantal) How the rest of y'all feeling?¬†¬†¬†

JEROME:¬†Shit -¬†I'm¬†going. Fuck this world.¬†¬†¬†

JEROME BOOTH. Sat next to Moses -¬†basically¬†his¬†lapdog.¬†¬†¬†

BETH:¬†Yeah. Me too...¬†¬†¬†

And BETH GODWIN. Shaved head. Athlete's body.¬†¬†¬†

BETH (CONT'D): (coldly) Even though y'all¬†won‚Äôt¬†let my girl come.¬†¬†¬†

MOSES: Nadi,¬†you're¬†being a quiet duck... What you¬†gotta¬†say 'bout¬†all'er¬†this?¬†¬†

Nadi. Put on the spot. Everyone's attention on her.¬†¬†¬†

NADI: Well... It just feels like¬†we're¬†giving up... I mean, people are here fighting for their civil and human rights,¬†whereas¬†we'll¬†be somewhere far away from all this¬†- without making a real contribution...¬†¬†¬†

Moses gives her a stone-like reaction.¬†¬†

NADI (CONT'D): (off Moses' look) It just seems to me we should still be fighting - rather than... running away.¬†¬†¬†

Awkward silence. Everyone back on Moses.¬†¬†¬†

MOSES: You think this is us running away?... (to others) Is that what the rest of y'all think? That this is ME, retreating from the cause?¬†¬†¬†

Moses cranes back at Nadi for an answer. She looks back without one.¬†¬†¬†

MOSES (CONT'D): Nadi. You like your books... Ever read 'Sun Tzu: the Art of War'?¬†¬†¬†

Nadi's eyes meet the others: 'What's he getting at?'¬†

NADI: ...No-¬†¬†

MOSES: -It was Sun Tzu that said: 'Build your opponent a golden bridge for which they will retreat across'... Well,¬†we're¬†gonna¬†build our own damn bridge - and while this side falls into political,¬†racial¬†and religious chaos...¬†we'll¬†be on the other side - creating a black utopia in the land of our ancestors, where humanity began and can begin again...¬†¬†¬†

Everyone's¬†clearly¬†heard this speech before.¬†¬†¬†

MOSES (CONT'D): But, hey! If y'all think¬†that's¬†a retreat - hey... y'all are entitled to your opinions... Free speech and all that, right?¬†Ain't¬†that what makes America great? Civilization great? Democracy?... (shakes 'no') Nah.¬†That's¬†an illusion... Not on our side though. On our side, in our utopia... that will be a REALITY.¬†¬†¬†

Another¬†awkward silence.¬†¬†¬†

JEROME: Retreat is sometimes... just advancing in a different direction... Right?¬†¬†¬†

MOSES: (to Jerome) Right! (to others) Right! Exactly!¬†¬†¬†

The B.A.D.S.¬†look back to each other. Moses' speech puts confidence back in them.¬†¬†¬†

MOSES (CONT'D): Well... What y'all say? Can I count on my people?¬†¬†¬†

Nadi, Chantal and¬†Tye:¬†sat together. Nod a hesitant 'Yes'.¬†¬†¬†

TYE:¬†Yeah, man... No sweat.¬†¬†¬†

Moses opens his hands, gestures: 'Is this over?'¬†

MOSES: Good... Good. Glad¬†we're¬†sticking to the original plan.¬†¬†¬†

The¬†waitress¬†brings over the six coffees.¬†¬†¬†

MOSES (CONT'D): (to group) I¬†gotta¬†leak.¬†¬†¬†

JEROME:¬†Yeah, me too.¬†¬†¬†

Moses leaves for the restroom. Jerome follows.¬†¬†¬†

CHANTAL: (to Beth) Seriously Beth?¬†We're¬†all leaving our loved ones behind and all you care about is if you can still get laid?¬†¬†

BETH: Oh, that's big talk coming from you!¬†¬†¬†

Chantal and Beth get into it from across the table - as:¬†¬†¬†

TYE: (to Nadi) Hey... Have you told him yet?¬†¬†¬†

Nadi searches to see if the other two heard - too busy arguing.¬†¬†¬†

NADI: No, but...¬†I've¬†decided¬†I'm¬†going do it tomorrow. That way I have the night to think about what¬†I'm¬†going to say...¬†¬†¬†

TYE: (supportive) Yeah. No sweat...¬†¬†¬†

Tye locks eyes with Nadi.¬†¬†¬†

TYE (CONT'D): But...¬†it's¬†about time, right?¬†¬†¬†

Underneath the table, Tye puts a hand on Nadi's lap.¬†¬†¬†¬†

**EXT. NORTH LONDON - STREET - EARLY MORNING**¬†¬†¬†

A chilly day on a crammed SHOPPING STREET.¬†¬†¬†

Henry crosses the road. He removes his headphones, stops and stares ahead:¬†¬†¬†

A large¬†line¬†has formed outside a¬†Jobcentre¬†- bulked with masked people.¬†Henry lets out a depressing sigh. Pulls out a mask before joins the line.¬†¬†

Now in line. Henry looks around at passing, covered up faces. Embarrassed.¬†¬†¬†

Then:¬†¬†¬†

PING.¬†¬†

Henry receives a TEXT. Opens it...¬†¬†¬†

It's¬†from Nadi. TEXT reads:¬†¬†¬†

'Hey Henry xx¬†Sorry¬†couldn't¬†talk¬†yesterday, but¬†urgently need to¬†talk¬†to U today.¬†When's¬†best for U??'¬†¬†¬†

Henry pulls down his mask to type. Excitement glows on his face as he clicks away.¬†¬†¬†

**INT. HENRY‚ÄôS FLAT - NORTH LONDON - LATER**¬†¬†¬†

\[Hey,¬†it‚Äôs¬†the OP here.¬†Miss me?...¬†Yeah, thought¬†so.¬†

This is the first of¬†four¬†scenes¬†I‚Äôll¬†be omitting¬†in this post¬†‚Äì but¬†don‚Äôt¬†worry,¬†I‚Äôm¬†going to give you¬†a brief summary¬†of the¬†scenes¬†instead.¬†¬†

In¬†this¬†first¬†scene, Henry¬†goes back to his flat to videochat with Nadi.¬†Once they first try¬†to¬†make some¬†rather awkward¬†small talk,¬†Nadi¬†then¬†tells Henry of her friends‚Äô¬†plan to start a commune in the¬†rainforest. As you can imagine, Henry is both¬†confused¬†and¬†rather pissed¬†off¬†by this news. After arguing about this for a couple of pages too long, Henry then asks what this means for their relationship¬†‚Äì and although Nadi¬†doesn‚Äôt¬†say it¬†out loud, her silence¬†basically confirms¬†she‚Äôs¬†breaking up with him.¬†

Well, now¬†that‚Äôs¬†out¬†of¬†the way,¬†let‚Äôs¬†continue to the next scene\]¬†

**INT. RESTURAUNT/PUB - LONDON - NIGHT**¬†¬†¬†

\[Yep¬†- still here.¬†

I‚Äôm¬†afraid this is another scene with some¬†badly written¬†dialogue.¬†I promise this¬†won‚Äôt¬†be a recurring theme throughout the script, so you can spare me your complaints in the¬†comments. Once we get to the adventure stuff, the dialogue‚Äôs¬†pretty much ok¬†from there on.¬†¬†

So, in this scene,¬†we find Henry in a pub-restaurant¬†sat amongst¬†his older sister, Ellie, her douche of a boyfriend, and his even¬†douchier¬†mates.¬†Henry is clearly piss-drunk in this scene,¬†and¬†Ellie¬†tries prying as to why¬†he‚Äôs¬†drinking his sorrows¬†away. Ellie‚Äôs boyfriend and his¬†mates then piss Henry off,¬†causing¬†him¬†to¬†drunkenly storm¬†out the¬†pub.¬†

The scene then transitions to¬†Ellie driving Henry‚Äôs drunken ass home,¬†all the¬†while¬†he¬†complains¬†about Nadi and her ‚Äúwoke‚Äù¬†American¬†activist¬†friends.¬†Trying¬†desperately¬†to change the subject, Ellie then mentions that she and her¬†douche of a¬†boyfriend got a DNA test¬†done¬†online. I know this sounds like¬†very¬†random dialogue to include, and it¬†definitely reads¬†this way, but what Ellie¬†says¬†here is¬†actually pretty¬†important to the story ‚Äì or what we screenwriters call a ‚Äúplot point.‚Äù¬†¬†

Well, what Ellie reveals to Henry, is that when her DNA results came back,¬†her ancestry was said to be 6% French and 6% Congolese (yeah, as in the place Nadi and her friends are going¬†to).¬†This revelation¬†seems to spark¬†something in Henry, causing¬†him to get out of¬†Ellie‚Äôs¬†car and take the London Underground home\]¬†

**INT. NADI‚ÄôS¬†APARTMENT¬†- BOSTON - NIGHT**¬†¬†¬†¬†

\[Ok. I know¬†you‚Äôre¬†all getting sick of me¬†excluding¬†pieces¬†of¬†the¬†story by now.¬†But¬†rest assured, this is the last time¬†I‚Äôm¬†going to¬†do this for the¬†remainder¬†of the series.¬†OP‚Äôs promise.¬†

In this final omitted scene, we find¬†Nadi¬†fast¬†asleep¬†in her bedroom. Her phone¬†then¬†rings¬†where she¬†wakes to Henry¬†calling her. We also read¬†here¬†that Tye is¬†asleep¬†next to¬†Nadi¬†(what a two-timer, am I right?) Moving to the living room to talk with Henry over the phone, Henry¬†then¬†asks Nadi if he can¬†accompany¬†the B.A.D.S. to¬†the Congo.¬†When Nadi says no¬†to this¬†due to¬†the trip¬†being¬†for members only, Henry tells her about¬†Ellie‚Äôs¬†DNA results (you know, the 6% Congolese thing?)¬†Henry¬†basically tells¬†Nadi¬†this to suggest he should go with her to the Congo because¬†he‚Äôs¬†also¬†technically of African heritage.¬†Although¬†she‚Äôs¬†amazed by this, Nadi still¬†isn‚Äôt¬†sure whether Henry can come with¬†them. But then Henry asks Nadi something to make his proposal far simpler... Does she still love him? The scene then¬†transitions¬†before Nadi can answer.¬†

Well, thank God¬†that‚Äôs¬†over and done with! Now we can carry on¬†through¬†the story with fewer interruptions from yours truly\]¬†

**INT. ROOM - UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY**¬†¬†

Inside a narrow, WHITE ROOM, a long table stretches from door to end. All¬†the¬†B.A.D.S.¬†members (except Nadi) are here - talking amongst themselves. Moses stands by a whiteboard with a black marker in hand, anxious to start.¬†¬†

MOSES:¬†(interrupts)¬†A‚Äôright.¬†Let's¬†get started. We¬†gotta¬†lot to cover...¬†¬†

CHANTAL:¬†Mo'. Nadi¬†ain't¬†here.¬†¬†

MOSES:¬†Well, we¬†gonna¬†have to¬†start¬†withou-¬†

The door opens on the far end:¬†it's¬†Nadi.¬†Rather embarrassed¬†- scurries down to the group.¬†

NADI:¬†Sorry,¬†I'm¬†late.¬†¬†

She sits. Tye saving her a seat between him and Chantal.¬†¬†

MOSES:¬†Right.¬†That's¬†everyone?¬†A'right, so - I just wanted to go over this... (to whiteboard) (remembers) Oh -¬†we're¬†all signed up with that African missionary¬†programme, right? Else how we all¬†gonna¬†get in?¬†

Everyone nods.¬†¬†

BETH:¬†Yeah. We signed up.¬†¬†

MOSES (CONT'D):¬†And¬†we're¬†all scheduled for our vaccinations? Cholera? Yellow fever? Typhoid?¬†

Again, all nod.¬†¬†

MOSES (CONT'D):¬†(at whiteboard)¬†A'right. So,¬†I just wanted to make this a little¬†more clear¬†for y'all...¬†¬†

Moses draws a long 'S' SHAPE on the whiteboard, copies from iPhone.¬†¬†

MOSES (CONT'D):¬†THIS:¬†is the Congo River... And THIS... (points) This is Kinshasa. Congo Capital City.¬†We'll¬†be landing here...¬†¬†

Marks KINSHASA on 'S'.¬†¬†

MOSES (CONT'D):¬†From the airport¬†we'll¬†get a cab ride to the river - meeting the guy with the boat. The¬†guy'll¬†journey us¬†up river, taking no more than a few days, before stopping temporarily in Mbandaka...¬†¬†

Marks 'MBANDAKA'.¬†¬†

MOSES (CONT'D):¬†We'll¬†get food, supplies - before continuing a few more days¬†up river. Getting off...¬†¬†

Draws smaller 's' on top the bigger 'S'.¬†¬†

MOSES (CONT'D):¬†HERE:¬†at the¬†Mongala¬†River.¬†We'll¬†then meet up with another guy.¬†He'll¬†guide us on foot through the interior.¬†It'll¬†take a day or two more to get to the point in the rainforest¬†we'll¬†call home. But once¬†we're¬†there -¬†it's¬†ours.¬†It'll¬†be our utopia. The journey will be long, but y'all need to remember: the only impossible journey is the one you¬†don't¬†even start... (pause) Any questions?¬†

JEROME:¬†(hand up) Yeah...¬†You¬†sure we can trust these guys? I mean, this is Africa, right?¬†¬†

MOSES:¬†Nah,¬†it's¬†cool, man. I checked them out. They seem pretty¬†clean¬†to me.¬†¬†

Chantal raises her hand.¬†¬†

MOSES:¬†Yeah?¬†¬†

CHANTAL:¬†What about rebels? I was just¬†checking online,¬†and... (on iPhone) It says there's fighting happening all around the rivers...¬†¬†

MOSES:¬†(to group) Guys, relax. I checked out everything. Our route should be perfectly safe. Most of the rebels are in the east of the country - but if we do run into trouble, our boat guy knows how to go undetected... Anyone else?¬†¬†

Everyone's¬†quiet. Then:¬†

Nadi. Her hand raised.¬†¬†

MOSES (CONT'D):¬†(sighs) Yeah?¬†¬†

NADI:¬†Yes. Thanks. Uhm... This is not really... related to the topic, but... I was just wandering if... maybe...¬†¬†

Nadi takes a breath. Just going to come out and say it.¬†¬†

NADI (CONT'D):¬†If¬†maybe Henry¬†could come with us?¬†

¬†Silence returns. Everyone looks awkwardly at each other: 'WHAT?' Tye, the most in¬†shock.¬†¬†

MOSES:¬†Henry?¬†¬†

NADI:¬†My boyfriend... in the UK.¬†¬†

MOSES:¬†What? The white guy?¬†¬†

NADI:¬†My British boyfriend in the UK -¬†yes.¬†¬†

Moses pauses at this.¬†¬†

MOSES:¬†So, let me get this straight...¬†You're¬†asking if your WHITE, British boyfriend,¬†can come on an¬†ALL BLACK¬†voyage into Africa?¬†¬†

Moses is confused - yet finds amusement in this.¬†¬†

MOSES (CONT'D):¬†What, is that a joke?¬†¬†

NADI:¬†No.¬†It's¬†just that we were talking a couple of days ago and...¬†I¬†happened to mention to him where we were going-¬†

MOSES:¬†-Wait, what??¬†

TYE:¬†You did what??¬†¬†

NADI:¬†...It just came up.¬†

JEROME:¬†(to Moses) But, I thought this was all¬†supposed to¬†be a secret? That we¬†weren't¬†gonna¬†tell nobody?¬†¬†

NADI:¬†(defensive) I had to tell him where we were going! He deserved an explanation...¬†

MOSES:¬†So, Naadia. Let me get this straight... Not only did you expose our plans to an outsider of the group...¬†but,¬†you're¬†now asking for this certain individual: a CAUCASIAN,¬†to come with us? On a voyage, SPECIFICALLY designed for¬†African-Americans, to travel back to the homeland of their ancestors - stolen away in chains by the ancestors of this same individual? Is that really what¬†you're¬†asking me right now?¬†¬†

NADI:¬†Since when was this trip only for¬†African-Americans? Am I American?¬†¬†

MOSES:¬†Nadi. Save your breath. Answer's 'No'.¬†¬†

NADI:¬†But,¬†he's-¬†

MOSES:¬†-But,¬†he's WHITE.¬†A'right? What, you think¬†he's¬†the only¬†cracker¬†who wanted in on this? I turned down¬†three¬†non-black¬†B.A.D.S.¬†asking to come. So, why should I make an exception for your boyfriend who¬†ain't¬†even a member? (to group) Has anyone here ever even met this guy?¬†¬†

CHANTAL:¬†I met him...¬†kinda.¬†¬†

NADI:¬†(sickened) ...I¬†can't¬†believe this. I thought this trip was so we can avoid discrimination - not embrace it.¬†¬†

MOSES:¬†Look, Nadi. Before you start ranting on about-¬†

TYE:¬†(to Nadi) -It's¬†best if¬†it's¬†just-¬†

NADI:¬†-Everyone SHUT UP!¬†¬†

Nadi shrugs¬†off¬†Tye as him and Moses fall silent.¬†She's¬†clearly had this effect before.¬†¬†

NADI (CONT'D):¬†Moses. I need you to just listen to me for a moment. Ok? Your voice does not always need to be heard...¬†¬†

Chantal puts a hand to her own mouth: 'OH NO, SHE DIDN'T!'¬†

NADI (CONT'D):¬†This group stands for 'The¬†Blood-hood¬†of African Descendants and¬†Sympathizers'. Everyone here going is a descendent - including me... When Henry asked me if he could come¬†with us, I initially said 'No' because he¬†wasn't¬†one of us... But then he tells me his sister had a DNA test - and as it happens... Henry and his sister are both six percent Congolese. Which means HE is a descendent... like everyone here.¬†¬†

MOSES:¬†Wait, what??¬†

CHANTAL:¬†Seriously?¬†¬†

TYE:¬†Are you kidding me??¬†¬†

NADI:¬†(ignores Tye) Look! I have proof - here!¬†¬†

Nadi gives Moses her phone, displays ELLIE'S RESULTS. Moses stares at it - worrisomely.¬†¬†

MOSES:¬†(unconvinced)¬†A'right. Show me this¬†cracker.¬†

Nadi looks blankly at him.¬†¬†

MOSES (CONT'D):¬†A picture - show me!¬†¬†

Nadi gets up a selfie of her and Henry¬†together. ZOOMS in on Henry.¬†¬†

Moses smiles. He takes the phone from Nadi to show Jerome and Tye.¬†¬†

MOSES (CONT'D):¬†I guess this¬†brother's¬†in the sunken place...¬†¬†

Moses and Jerome laugh - as does Tye.¬†¬†

MOSES (CONT'D):¬†(to Nadi)¬†You're¬†telling me this guy: is six percent African? No dark skin? No dark hair? No... big dick or nothing?¬†¬†

NADI:¬†If having a big dick qualifies someone on going, then¬†nobody¬†in this room would be.¬†¬†

BETH:¬†OH DAMN!¬†

JEROME:¬†Hey! Hey!¬†¬†

TYE:¬†(over noise) He still¬†ain't¬†a member!¬†¬†

Tye's outburst silences the room.¬†¬†

TYE (CONT'D):¬†It's¬†members only... (to Moses) Right Mo'?¬†¬†

MOSES:¬†Right! Members only.¬†Don't¬†matter if he's African or not.¬†¬†

NADI:¬†He can BECOME a member! 'African Descendants and Sympathizers' -¬†he's¬†both! I mean, the¬†amount¬†of times¬†he's¬†defended me - and all because some¬†racist¬†idiot chose to make a remark about the colour of my skin... And if you are this petty to not let¬†him¬†come, then... you can count me out as well.¬†¬†

MOSES:¬†What?-¬†¬†

TYRONE:¬†-What??¬†¬†

Tye's¬†turned his body fully towards Nadi.¬†¬†

CHANTAL:¬†Well, I¬†ain't¬†going if Nadi's not going.¬†¬†

BETH:¬†Great.¬†So,¬†I'm¬†the only girl now?¬†

MOSES:¬†What d'you care?! You threatened out when I said no to you too!...¬†¬†

The whole room erupts into argument¬†‚Äì¬†all¬†while¬†Tye stares daggers into Nadi. She ignores him.¬†

**INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER**¬†¬†

Nadi leaves the room as the door shuts behind. She walks off, as a grin slowly dimples her face. She struts triumphantly!¬†¬†

TYE:¬†Nadi! Nadi, wait!¬†¬†

Tye throws the door open to come storming after her. Nadi stops reluctantly.¬†¬†

TYE (CONT'D):¬†I told¬†you,¬†you were the only reason I was going...¬†¬†

Nadi allows them to hold eye contact. Sympathetic for a moment...¬†

NADI:¬†Then you¬†were¬†going for the¬†wrong¬†reasons.¬†¬†

With that, Nadi turns away. Leaves Tye to watch her go.¬†¬†

**INT. AIRPLANE - IN AIR - NIGHT**¬†¬†

Now on a FLIGHT to KINSHASA, DR CONGO. Henry¬†is deep in sleep.¬†¬†

INTERCUT WITH:¬†¬†

A JUNGLE: like we saw before. Thick green trees - and a LARGE BUSH. No sound.¬†¬†

BACK TO:¬†¬†

Henry. Still asleep. Eyes scrunch up - like¬†he's¬†having a bad dream. Then:¬†¬†

JUNGLE: the bush now enclosed¬†by¬†a LONG, SHARPLY SPIKED FENCE. Defends EMERALD DARKNESS on other side. We hear a wailing... Slowly gets louder. Before:¬†¬†

Henry wakes! Gasps! Drenched in sweat. Looks around to see passengers sleeping¬†peacefully.¬†Regains himself.¬†¬†

Henry now removes his seatbelt and moves to the back of plane.¬†¬†

**INT. AIRPLANE RESTROOM - CONTINUOUS.**¬†¬†

Henry shuts the door. Sound outside disappears. Takes off his mask and looks in the mirror - breathes heavily as he searches his own eyes.¬†¬†

HENRY:¬†(to himself) Why are you doing this? Why is¬†she¬†this important to you?¬†

Henry crouches over the sink. Splashes water on his sweat-drenched face.¬†¬†

His breathing calms down. Tap still runs, as Henry looks up again...¬†¬†

HENRY (CONT'D):¬†(to reflection) ...This is insane.¬†¬†

FADE OUT.¬†

\[Well, there we have it. Our characters have been introduced and the call to adventure answered... Man, that Moses guy is¬†kind¬†of a¬†douche, isn‚Äôt he?¬†¬†

Once again,¬†I‚Äôm¬†sorry about all the omitted scenes, but that dialogue really was¬†badly written. The only regret I have¬†with¬†excluding those scenes was we¬†didn‚Äôt¬†get a proper introduction to Henry¬†‚Äì he is our protagonist after all. Rest assured,¬†you‚Äôll¬†see plenty of him in Part Three.¬†

Next week,¬†we¬†officially begin our journey¬†up the Congo River and into¬†the¬†mysterious depths of¬†the¬†Rainforest...¬†where the real horror finally begins.¬†

Before¬†we¬†end things this week, there¬†are¬†some¬†things¬†I need to clarify... The whole Henry is 6% Congolese plot point?...¬†Yeah, that was completely made up for the screenplay.¬†Something else which was also made up, was that Henry asked Nadi¬†if he could¬†accompany¬†the B.A.D.S. on their expedition.¬†In reality, Henry¬†didn‚Äôt¬†ask Nadi¬†if he could come along... Nadi¬†asked him.¬†Apparently, the¬†reason Henry was invited¬†on the trip¬†(rather¬†than¬†weaselling¬†his way into¬†it)¬†was because the group¬†didn‚Äôt¬†have enough¬†members willing to join¬†their commune¬†‚Äì and so, they had to make do with Henry.¬†¬†

When I asked the writer why he changed this, the reason he gave was simply because he felt Henry‚Äôs call to adventure had to be¬†a lot more interesting...¬†That‚Äôs¬†the real difference between storytelling and real life right there...¬†Storytelling forces things to happen,¬†whereas¬†in real life... things just happen.¬†

Well,¬†that‚Äôs¬†everything for this week, folks. Join me again next time, where¬†our¬†journey into the¬†‚ÄúHeart of Darkness‚Äù¬†will¬†finally¬†commence...¬†

Thanks for tuning in¬†everyone, and¬†until¬†next time, this is the OP,¬†

I tripped over my feet and fell forward. My hands instinctively flew out in front of me and I caught myself on an accent table near the bank of chairs, but not before my knees hit the floor. Bradley rose to his feet and Eliseo stepped towards me with concern, but I quickly stood up and dusted myself off, trying not to embarrass myself any further.¬†

‚ÄúYou okay there, Bishop?‚Äù Eliseo asked, more humored than concerned.¬†

For whatever reason, he always insisted on calling me by my last name instead of my given name.¬†

‚ÄúYeah, fine,‚Äù I said, brushing him off. For obvious reasons, I was more interested in Bradley and why he was here. I was also keenly aware that I now had an audience in Eliseo and his clients. Whatever happened from this point forward was going to be fodder for office gossip.¬† ¬†

‚ÄúBradley,‚Äù I said.¬†

He took a step towards me, concern replaced with‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt tell. I couldn‚Äôt read his face.

‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù I continued. ‚ÄúI didn't even give you my name.‚Äù

He shrugged his shoulders.

‚ÄúI work for the Governor, remember?‚Äù

I pondered the lawfulness of that statement for a moment.

‚ÄúIsn't that illegal?‚Äù

‚ÄúI prefer to call it a perk.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù I said and suddenly felt flushed, imagining the extent Bradley went to find me. My heart beat a little harder and a little faster, but I reminded myself that there was no way he was interested in me. He had to be here for a different reason.¬† ¬†

On cue, Bradley handed me a small bag.¬†

‚ÄúYou left these,‚Äù he said.¬†

My shoes.¬†

See? He had only stopped by to return my shoes.¬†

But why go through all the trouble of finding me and my place of employment? Why not just return them to Lisa or leave them where someone would find them?¬†

*Why else?*¬†

No‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt let my hopes get up, even with all the contrasting evidence.¬†

I opened my mouth to thank him but interrupted him instead. Bradley smiled and said, ‚ÄúLadies first.‚Äù

I blushed, finding it difficult to make eye contact with him.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ just‚Ä¶ thank you for returning these to me.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou're welcome,‚Äù he said, with a chivalrous bow of his head. ‚ÄúI really enjoyed Friday night and would like to see you again.‚Äù¬†

My head jerked up at those words. He wanted to see me again?¬†

‚ÄúReally?‚Äù

Yes, that was the only thing I managed to say.

Bradley chuckled.¬†

‚ÄúYes, really.‚Äù

I knew I had a stupid grin on my face. I could feel the ends of my mouth inching higher and higher.¬†

He was asking me out.¬†

He was asking *me* out!

My heart was skipping now. I tried to let myself enjoy this moment, to revel in the fact that this handsome man had probably committed a felony (or perhaps just a misdemeanor) to find me. And here I was, stunned silent. I stared up at his face, his beautiful, beautiful face, part of me wanting to see if he was being serious, or if I just needed stronger coffee. This couldn‚Äôt be. I looked down briefly at his hand and saw he was no longer wearing his wedding band.¬†

This was real. And he was being serious. ¬†

‚ÄúWell, Bishop?‚Äù

I looked at Eliseo and frowned, upset that he was interrupting my thoughts.

‚ÄúSay yes,‚Äù he urged me, his voice filled with humor as his clients nodded with approval.

My face grew hot with embarrassment and I quickly turned away from them to Bradley, whose face did not betray any angst or suspense he may have been feeling. But then why would he, looking the way he did? No woman in her right mind would turn him down.¬†

So what the hell was I waiting for?

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I finally breathed out.¬†

‚ÄúGood. I'll pick you up at seven o'clock tonight.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I said again. ¬†

Bradley smiled and turned to leave. It occurred to me then he didn't know where I lived. I called after him, but he simply reminded me, ‚ÄúI work for the Governor, remember?‚Äù

I couldn't stop smiling the remainder of the day. Yes, I was the subject of office gossip, but I didn‚Äôt care, I had a date with the most handsome man in the city.¬†

Of course, I couldn't get any work done; and the interview bombed, but that was okay: I had a date!¬†

Later that afternoon, Eliseo came to my desk and sat at the corner of it. He didn't say anything, just looked at me.

‚ÄúYes, Martinez?‚Äù I sometimes called him by his last name as well, but it didn't have the same ring to it.¬†

‚ÄúThat was some excitement this morning, huh?‚Äù he said, nonchalantly.¬†

I didn't know what he was getting at, but I knew he was up to something. He was an attorney, after all.¬†

I continued working.¬†

‚ÄúIf that's what you want to call it.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you kidding?‚Äù he exclaimed. ‚ÄúYou know how I would be acting if the man of my dreams came to my workplace and asked me out?‚Äù

I stopped what I was doing and glared at him.¬†

‚ÄúI don't know, but I imagine your wife wouldn't be happy.‚Äù

He was unfazed by my comment.¬†

‚ÄúYou want to take off early?‚Äù

I eyed him suspiciously.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I know how hard you work, and you'll probably need more than a few minutes to properly prepare for an evening with someone of Mr. Mauer's stature. If you want to leave early today, it wouldn't be an issue,‚Äù he said almost innocently, almost convincingly; but he had just stepped out of a meeting with the other partners in the firm, where he probably mentioned this morning's events between his assistant and the Governor's Campaign Manager‚Ä¶¬†

‚ÄúEliseo, it's really sad you would use my social life for your personal gain.‚Äù

‚ÄúI'm a lawyer, Abbey. I can't help it.‚Äù¬†

He only used my first name when he wanted to appeal to my good nature.¬†

It was working.¬†

‚ÄúSo, you want to leave or not?‚Äù he asked again. ¬†

‚ÄúOf course I do,‚Äù I said. I wasn't stupid; if the boss tells you to take an afternoon off, you don't argue.¬†

‚ÄúGood, go. Be sure to mention my name and bring back some juicy details.‚Äù

‚ÄúShould I sleep with him too?‚Äù I asked sarcastically.

‚ÄúIf it helps us get in with the Governor.‚Äù

He wasn‚Äôt joking about that.¬†

But he had said I could leave early, so I gathered my things and left. I got home and had begun perusing when Nicole got home from school.¬†

As the oldest, Nicole watched Zo√´ after school until I got home later in the evening. They were usually pretty good about getting homework and chores done (though Zo√´ often needed some coaxing). Needless to say, Nicole was surprised to see me, and she took the opportunity to tell me exactly what had been bothering her‚Ä¶ at least since Friday.¬†

‚ÄúMom, everyone was talking about the way you were acting during the dance.‚Äù

With Nicole, everyone meant about six people, including the janitor, but I was curious as to how I was acting translated into 'teen-speak.‚Äô

‚ÄúWhat are you talking about, Nicole?‚Äù I asked, innocently.

‚ÄúThe way you were fawning over Sara Mauer's dad.‚Äù

Oh, that‚Ä¶¬†

‚ÄúI wasn't fawning.‚Äù

‚ÄúMom, you were following him around like a puppy; and laughing at everything he said. Even I know what that means.‚Äù

It was nice to see she did pay attention; though I wished it was to more appropriate things.¬†

‚ÄúListen, we were chaperoning; and we danced once. That's it,‚Äù I replied.¬†

She didn't seem to hear me though.

‚ÄúYou don't get it. This is Sara Mauer's dad. Sara is Jenna Mitchell's friend, who's the Governor's daughter. They run the school. Now, my mom is making moves on Sara's dad. Who are they going to make fun of? Who are they going to pick on?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhoa, Nicole. Slow down,‚Äù I said, suddenly understanding her angst. Because she was really smart and on the chubby side, Nicole was often picked on by popular members of her class. But that was at her last school. She had not mentioned having the same issues here. ‚ÄúIf you're having problems with these girls, we need to fix this.‚Äù

Nicole was crying now.

‚ÄúI knew you wouldn't understand,‚Äù she said turning away from me.¬†

I pulled her back, but she refused to look at me.

‚ÄúNicole, we need to talk about this.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy? You don't listen to me. I asked you not to go to the dance and you did and now look.‚Äù

I sighed, hating that my joy was now her misery. ¬†

‚ÄúHoney, people like that don't need a reason to harass you. We need to deal with the problem, not change to suit them,‚Äù I said.¬†

She didn‚Äôt respond, just sighed as her tears fell to the floor. I really didn‚Äôt know what else to say and I had yet to tell her about my date with Bradley. That was going to surely make things worse. I couldn‚Äôt dawdle anymore.¬†

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just sit down and talk about this‚Ä¶,‚Äù I said, and swallowed hard, not wanting to do this next part, but knowing I had to. ‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs something I need to mention first.‚Äù

She didn't move.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ have a date tonight‚Ä¶‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt respond. ¬†

‚ÄúWith him... with Bradley Mauer...‚Äù

She looked up at me, her eyes red from crying, but also something else‚Ä¶ they were red with fury. I braced myself.¬†

I think Gooby prepares it for me. I don‚Äôt know.  
  
I didn‚Äôt see him sitting on the edge of my bed that morning, so I imagine he‚Äôs off doing something. Maybe he crochets. I wonder if he‚Äôd make me a hat.

As I take my first sip of coffee and let its bitter warmth infest my veins, I stare at myself in the mirror and feel my blood run cold. This happens every morning without fail, and it never ceases to terrify me to my core. It is the kind of petrifying fear that you only get when noticing a figure at the corner of your vision. A stranger is watching me through the glass, drinking instant coffee out of a mug labeled ‚ÄúdnuorA gninwolC‚Äù. I don‚Äôt recognize his face.¬†

I have a medical condition. Probably should have mentioned that, but better late than never. Doctors say it‚Äôs something similar to Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder, but it‚Äôs not quite that. You typically feel like you‚Äôre in a dreamlike state with DPDR, and everything is supposed to move more slowly. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm in a dream at all. Everything moves the same. Everything feels so vivid and focused that I sometimes almost vomit from motion sickness. No, I feel like I‚Äôm awake, aware, and painfully receptive to the horrible things of my reality. It‚Äôs just my face.

I never recognize my face. It‚Äôs never the same to me. I can‚Äôt tell if it switches forms or if my memory is simply that bad, but I am never at ease with it. My makeup is the only thing that calms me down.¬†

I start my ritual the same every morning. First is the white makeup, the canvas, the blank slate from which I carve my visage. Then comes the black, void, deeper than night and shadow, festering like a ripe spawn of the depths. Then I draw a little shamrock on my cheek because I like green. Finally, I force on my red eyebrows and smile. I apply enough powder to last through a hurricane, and finally, I'm ready to go. I step out of my trailer and into the desert that I call home.¬†

What I stated in the title is true. I reside in a permanent Carnival fixture that rests on the side of a near-endless stretch of highway in the middle of the desert. I have no idea what state I'm in, nor if I'm even in America. What I do know is that any mail I get is completely unmarked, save for my name, and it always appears at the doorstep of my trailer every week, anchored under a rock.¬† I'm fairly certain the boss reads my mail, which is why my name is always misspelled on the envelope, but I don't care.¬† I cook for myself, clean up after myself, and live alone in a trailer that I'm almost certain used to be a drug den. I cleaned it up, got rid of all the stains in the carpet,¬† and now it is mine.¬† I do find the occasional needle or bone every once in a while, but no home is perfect, especially around here.

I'm not completely devoid of supplies, of course. There is a gas station about a mile down the road run by an elderly couple who swear I'm not the strangest thing they've seen walking into their doors at night. I am apparently the friendliest, which is worrying in its own regard.¬†

I use them to stock up on basic groceries and toiletries to get by, which is convenient considering that my pay is what many would consider abysmal. That said, in the instance that the boss sees this and decides to dock me for complaining,¬† I am joking. I don't have much I need to buy anyway, and, scary as it may be, delivery services do still work out here.

But that is my existence, and one that I am stuck with. I have a gigantic orange tricycle that I ride when I don't want to walk, and a comfy set of size 20 shoes that get me the rest of the way. All in all, it‚Äôs a steady job, but one I find taxing on the best days.¬†

I'll summarize it like this:¬† I am a clown who does not talk. I never talk. I'm half convinced I can't, but even if I wanted to try, it wouldn't be with the people around here. Most of my coworkers are fine people as they are, but sometimes the scarier things come in the form of the guests.

¬†¬†One of my talents is balloon animals. I can make almost anything proficiently.¬† Sometimes I'll get the occasional person who wants to try and challenge me, and they‚Äôll try to order off the menu I carry around with my balloon bag. Many times, they're innocent enough.¬† Several children want their favorite cartoon characters, or Tommy guns, or ( insert exotic animal here), but on occasion, the requests can get a tad morbid.¬†

Today, I remember one corpulent little boy stopping me on my way to clean out the petting zoo to make such a request.¬†

‚ÄúCan you make a spine?‚Äù he asked me.

I stared at him for a second before raising my question-mark sign.¬†

‚ÄúY‚Äôknow,‚Äù he repeated, ‚ÄúA spine? Like what‚Äôs in your back?‚Äù

The stare continued as a couple in matching Hawaiian shirts walked up behind him. They were assumed to be his parents, but they did not attempt to dissuade him.¬†

‚ÄúCarter,‚Äù said the woman in a distinctly shrill Minnesota accent, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be silly.‚Äù

‚ÄúCarter, you know better,‚Äù said the man with an almost shriller accent, ‚Äúyou have to be more specific. What kind of spine?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh!‚Äù the boy said, with a wide smile. ‚ÄúDuh! Sorry, Mr. Clown. Can I have a human spine, please?

I kept the question-mark sign up.¬†

‚ÄúOh, it doesn‚Äôt have to have a skull attached!‚Äù the man laughed, ‚ÄúSorry for the confusion. Just the spine itself would be nice for the boy.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, maybe a pelvis!‚Äù the woman added. ‚ÄúGood eatin‚Äô on one of those. Could you do that, Mr. Clown?‚Äù

By this point, I had retrieved my whiteboard and expo marker to try and write out a more sophisticated response, but the woman cut me off.¬†

‚ÄúY‚Äôknow,‚Äù she said, reaching into her beach bag, ‚Äúkinda like this?‚Äù

Out of the bag, she proceeded to pull out a yellow spine, at least a meter in length. It was old, though not dusty, and had several gnarled splinters coming off of its vertebrae. I was hesitant to ask where she‚Äôd gotten it, but the man spoke up next her her.

‚ÄúOh, would you look at that, hon?‚Äù he said, all sentimental, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs from our first road trip, innit? What was his name?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúJo?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, wasn‚Äôt jo? Hank?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúDillion!‚Äù said the boy. ‚ÄúYou told me about that one.‚Äù¬†

The boy‚Äôs father ruffled his shaggy hair as he adjusted his sunglasses. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it! Wow! Look at the kid on this brain, hon! So mindful!‚Äù

‚ÄúHe sure is!‚Äù the woman said. ‚ÄúThat trip was before you were even born.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, good memories. Good memories‚Ä¶‚Äù The father looked back at me with a smile. ‚ÄúSo what d‚Äôya say, Mr. Clown? Spine sound good?‚Äù

He held out a twenty, and if I were a prouder man, I would‚Äôve been more apprehensive at taking it. But a twenty is a twenty. I made the best spine I could, using every shade of white and bone yellow I could think of, and in less than a minute, the boy was holding his latex prize and beaming like it was Christmas.¬†

The parents thanked me and parted ways, and I can‚Äôt recall seeing them the rest of the day. I went about my normal route through the petting zoo, the ferris wheel, the hall of mirrors, etc., and it wasn‚Äôt until this evening that I heard of anything wrong.¬†

A sheriff‚Äôs deputy was at the gates by six o‚Äôclock and was speaking sternly with the head manager. The manager, Bill, an older man who always wore a striped jacket and straw boater hat, was making every disarming gesture in the book as he conversed with the man. Eventually, the deputy left, and Bill locked the gates behind him. He passed by and gave a bright, ‚ÄúEvening, Bubbles!‚Äù but I stopped him with my question-sign.¬†

‚ÄúOh, that?‚Äù He said, smiling, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing. Just something for the boss to handle.‚Äù

¬†I gave the sign another shake.¬†

‚ÄúOh, Bubs,‚Äù he said, checking over his shoulder before leaning in. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre just looking for one of the teenagers from back in town. That‚Äôs all.‚Äù He straightened his bowtie. ‚ÄúY‚Äôknow, Bradley, who works the tickets at the Ferris wheel? His folks called the sheriff and said he was supposed to be home hours ago. Never did clock out, come to think of it‚Ä¶ Well, I don‚Äôt know. He only tore tickets for one family today- great tippers, by the way- and, well‚Ä¶‚Äù He paused and held up his hands defensively. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm rambling. Point is, it‚Äôs nothing for you to worry about. Go get some rest! We still have a few weeks until tourist season starts up again. Savor it all while you can!‚Äù

With that, he was off, and I was left feeling for the twenty in my pocket. There was nothing to be done. At the end of the day, there was no one to tell, and I didn‚Äôt even have a name or vehicle to attach to any floating suspicions. Not to mention, it was getting late, and the gas station was at least half an hour away by trike, so I stowed my balloons, unlocked my ride from its fence post, and took off down the road. The gas station‚Äôs glow was a fly-light in the distance, and I was a moth with twenty dollars to spend.¬†

\*\*\*

Most children, on a long car ride, for whatever reason, imagine some kind of being that runs alongside them on the road. It‚Äôs always moving at impossible speeds, keeping time with every stop, turn, and acceleration, pacing like a silent wolf through a deep bed of snow. I never had one of those as a child, but I do have one now, more or less.  
  
As I race my trike through the obsidian night, a single LED headlight gleaming, I sometimes see a pale figure, stark white and tall, bounding on the horizon towards the road. Sometimes, when I ride slower, I swear I can hear him howling something. He seems urgent, panicked, even, but I can‚Äôt make out his face. He‚Äôs a blip in the twilight of the desert. A single pale flame shimmering on the backdrop of a purple void. If I wait even longer, his mournful voice sounds familiar to me, but even then, I cannot recognize him.¬†  
  
I‚Äôve tried to name him, but nothing sticks. Chad didn‚Äôt work. Didn‚Äôt have the right mouthfeel. Neither did Otis or Wheeler. He‚Äôs such a simple-looking thing, and those are always the hardest to name. I‚Äôve just started calling him ‚ÄúThat Guy,‚Äù and that works about as well as anything. He‚Äôs always gone when I make it to the gas station, but he reappears on my rides back, still in the distance and still running.¬†  
  
That Guy is odd, for sure,¬† but in all the years I‚Äôve seen him, he‚Äôs never done me a bad turn. His presence, even if unsettling, reminds me that I‚Äôm not alone on my nightly ride. I blew him a kiss tonight in a dramatic fashion before entering my trailer. His howling evaporated as my door slammed shut.¬†  
  
I brought Gooby back some peanut M&Ms and left them on my dresser with a note saying they were his. I didn‚Äôt really think about how he‚Äôd eat them, seeing as he has no mouth, but I figured it was the thought that counted. I performed my ritual and stared briefly at the stranger in the mirror before me, trying to take in any solid feature, but I couldn‚Äôt. I shivered and went to bury myself in the covers of my bed, but was met by something unexpected.  
  
There, neatly folded on my pillow, was a crocheted cap with a tassel on the end. It was a handsome thing and only vaguely smelled of vinegar. I put on, and that was enough inspiration to get me to write this. Long post, I know, but hey, I have a new hat. I think it‚Äôs rather nice of Gooby to do, and I wanted to brag on him. If he does anything else brag-worthy, I‚Äôll be sure to post again. In the meantime, wish me luck and pray to whatever you may believe in that the gas station gets a new instant ramen flavor in soon. I‚Äôm getting tired of shrimp.¬† Thanks for reading this far.¬†  
  
  
  
Also, on a separate note, if you meet a midwestern couple in Hawaiian shirts, maybe try being somewhere else. Or make a balloon animal for them.¬†

Zinc plays a huge role in testosterone, immunity, and recovery. I raised my target from the RDA (11 mg) to **27.5 mg/day** ‚Äî based on optimal ranges seen in fertility and performance research.

* I keep a zinc supplement on standby and **cut it into halves or quarters**, depending on how much I fall short from food.
* I also try to get zinc from **whole foods first**: red meat, pumpkin seeds, eggs, and shellfish when I can afford it.

**Copper ‚Äì Target: 2.8 mg**

Zinc and copper compete for absorption, so it‚Äôs important to **balance them**. The ideal zinc:copper ratio is roughly **10:1** ‚Äî so I‚Äôve set copper at **2.8 mg/day** to align with my higher zinc intake.

How I get it:

* **1 Tbsp of unsweetened cocoa powder** in my morning coffee (surprisingly copper-rich)
* **Beef liver** mixed into my homemade breakfast sausage (adds both copper and vitamin A)
* Sometimes I‚Äôll add in dark chocolate or sunflower seeds if I‚Äôm still short.

**Selenium ‚Äì Target: 200 ¬µg**

The RDA is 55 ¬µg, but research shows **\~200 ¬µg/day** may be optimal for testosterone and antioxidant support.

* I keep **Brazil nuts** on standby:
   * If I‚Äôm below target ‚Üí I eat **one**.
   * If I‚Äôve hit or exceeded 200 ¬µg ‚Üí **skip the nut.**
* Do not overdose on Selenium above 400 ¬µg

**Magnesium ‚Äì Target: 500 mg**

The RDA is often too low for anyone doing weight training, sweating, or under stress. I raised my target to **500 mg/day**.

* I get most of it from **beans, greens, and seeds**, but one easy way to grab some magnesium besides supplements is to drink mineral water with high magnesium e.g. Gerolsteiner (80mg per 750ml bottle)
* Better sleep, less cramps, and better lifts.

**Missing in Cronometer: Vitamin K2**

Cronometer only tracks **K1**, but **K2 (especially MK-4 and MK-7)** is critical for calcium regulation, cardiovascular health, and male longevity.

Here‚Äôs how I backfill it:

* **Beef liver** (some MK-4)
* **Aged cheese** \- I usually do an ounce of aged **Gouda** daily or other high K2 cheese
* **Live-fermented kimchi or sauerkraut**
* **Grass-fed butter** when I use butter

The evening wound down from there. The crowds became noticeably thinner and the deejay a bit lazier in his selections.¬†

All the while, Bradley and I continued talking‚Äîabout his daughter, Sara, who was smart and lovely; his wife Elizabeth, who died in a car accident six years earlier (and not in some asylum after trying to kill Sara, as Terri purported... not that I thought there was an ounce of truth to it, I‚Äôm just clarifying); and his mother Grace, who helped him raise Sara after Elizabeth‚Äôs death. I didn't know if he was this forthright with everyone, but it was nice sitting there with him. My inhibitions and insecurities remained front and center‚Äîhe was, after all, a beautiful man‚Äîbut with each moment we shared, I relaxed just a little bit.¬†

The deejay eventually signed off and began breaking down his equipment as volunteers came in to clear out the chairs and tables.¬†

Terri was long-gone at this point; and Lisa was nowhere to be seen.¬†

I looked at my watch. It was almost midnight.¬†

‚ÄúI should go,‚Äù I said, standing up.¬†

Bradley stood with me, ever the gentleman.¬†

‚ÄúMay I escort you to your car?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúOh, that's not necessary,‚Äù I dismissed him. ‚ÄúThank you, though.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYou're a brave woman, going out alone, past the witching hour,‚Äù he said, an eyebrow raised.¬†

I laughed.¬†

‚ÄúI think I'll be alright, really. It was nice meeting you.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe pleasure was mine,‚Äù he said.¬†

I couldn't help but smile as I walked to my car, very much thrilled with how my evening turned out.¬†

But as I hit the gravel outside, I winced and realized I had left my shoes inside. I pondered going back in and sheepishly explaining myself, but I had this stupid fantasy in my head that he was watching me longingly as I walked away from him; and to go back in would ruin that. I didn‚Äôt want to do that‚Ä¶ even as I was certain Bradley wanted nothing from me. I was so far out of his league, it would never occur to him that I, the overweight, awkward woman he met at the dance, hadn‚Äôt even bothered to give him her name.¬†

I wanted to slap my forehead at that realization. How stupid was that? Forget not standing a chance with him‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt deserve one.¬†

I took a deep breath and decided to put the evening behind me. I swallowed hard as I put one foot in front of the other and slowly made it out to my car. I put my sneakers back on and drove home.¬†

Nicole was spending the night at Holly's house so I wouldn't see her until tomorrow morning, which left me on my own for the rest of the night. I stopped by the kitchen for a snack and went to my bedroom, where I settled in for the night. And though I fought to distract myself from Bradley Mauer, my thoughts (and my dreams) continually went back to him.

I woke up early on Saturday and changed into some old sweatpants and a t-shirt before heading to the kitchen for coffee and breakfast. Saturday was our cleaning day and though it wasn‚Äôt fun for any of us, I wanted my girls to be able to keep a clean home and take care of themselves... should they end up like their mother.¬†

Nine o'clock came with a knock on the door. It was Jackie and Zo√´.¬†

‚ÄúHi, Mommy,‚Äù my daughter said with a wave as she walked past me.¬†

‚ÄúI hope she wasn't too much trouble,‚Äù I said, though I knew she wasn't. ¬†

‚ÄúOh no, Abbey, she's an angel. It was no problem keeping her,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúJust let us know whenever you need a sitter.‚Äù

‚ÄúI will, thanks,‚Äù I said and closed the door as she turned back to her apartment.¬†

I tripped over Zo√´'s book bag, which she had dropped in the hallway to attend to more important things‚Äîfood. I kicked it out of the way and went to the kitchen, where she was looking through the cabinet for her favorite snack, toaster pastries.¬†

‚ÄúDidn't you eat already?‚Äù I asked, getting her a napkin.

She pulled apart the package and started eating the pieces that broke off.¬†

‚ÄúYeah, but I'm still hungry,‚Äù she answered, settling onto the stool at the counter.

‚ÄúSo, how was your evening?‚Äù I asked, as I grabbed a bucket from under the sink.

‚ÄúFine,‚Äù she said, in between bites.

‚ÄúDid anyone have to go the hospital?‚Äù

‚ÄúNope.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid the fire department have to come again?‚Äù

‚ÄúNope.‚Äù

‚ÄúAny more lost teeth?‚Äù

She had to stop and think about the question.¬†

‚ÄúDoes a chipped tooth count?‚Äù she asked.¬†

I stopped gathering cleaning materials and looked at Zo√´ with a thoughtful gaze. Where Mark and Jeffrey were concerned, a chipped tooth was the least of things that could go wrong, which meant they were better behaved than usual. Still‚Ä¶

‚ÄúYeah, it counts,‚Äù I said, placing the bucket on the counter and sitting next to her.

‚ÄúThen, yeah. Did you dance and embarrass Nicole?‚Äù¬†

Zo√´ took immense pleasure in tormenting her sister and I didn't correct her as often as I should, which was wrong, I know, but sometimes led to little moments like this.

‚ÄúI did, I think,‚Äù I replied. ¬†

She laughed, choking on her pastry, then said, ‚ÄúDid you do anything else?‚Äù¬†

*Met the man of my dreams, left him and my shoes behind‚Ä¶*¬†

‚ÄúNope.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds boring,‚Äù she said, shoving the last morsel of food into her mouth.¬†

‚ÄúNot as boring as your day is going to be if you don't get started soon,‚Äù I said, handing her a new toilet cleaner.¬†

‚ÄúAww Mom!‚Äù she exclaimed, slumping in her seat.¬†

‚ÄúAww, Zo√´. We do this every Saturday. You should be used to it by now,‚Äù I said to her.¬†

‚ÄúWhat about Nicole?‚Äù she whined.

‚ÄúDon't worry about Nicole. You just go pick up your book bag, change your clothes and come grab the bucket,‚Äù I stated firmly. ¬†

Zo√´ slid off her seat and started out of the kitchen, mumbling.¬†

‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù I called after her.¬†

‚ÄúYes, ma'am,‚Äù she yelled from the other room.¬†

The rest of the day flew by. Nicole came home after lunch in a mood worse than the one I last saw her in. I didn't say anything, hoping the problem would solve itself; but of course, it didn‚Äôt. And when Monday came around, she was still giving me the silent treatment.¬†

I continued to let it slide, knowing eventually she'd talk to me, and focused, instead, on the day ahead. I had another interview scheduled and the thought of sitting through that with another unqualified applicant was completely demoralizing.¬†

I got off the elevator on the twenty-fourth floor and walked through the dimly lit office, turning lights on as I went along. We occupied the entire floor, which meant I spent a lot of time running between offices. I had purposely worn my comfortable flats on today, hoping to be ready for whatever came.¬†

I was not.¬†

I poured myself a cup of coffee and was reviewing my schedule, when my phone rang. It was Lisa Brooks.¬†

I groaned internally. I knew why she was calling, and I wasn‚Äôt looking forward to the conversation.

‚ÄúGood morning, Mrs. Bishop,‚Äù she said.¬†

I said nothing.

‚ÄúWhile I appreciate you being at the dance Friday, I am concerned with some reports I received about your behavior. You weren't at your assigned post. And you were dancing with one of the other parents. I ask you, what kind of example do you think you set for the children?‚Äù

I shouldn't have taken the accusations so personal (given that I was guilty of them), but I did. This was what I got for not backing out like I wanted to? Now I would probably get my Level II chaperone status revoked (the one that allowed me to watch over more kids than my own‚Äîthough that might not be so bad) and be blacklisted from all future PTA-sponsored events (again, where was the downside?).

‚ÄúLisa, I did nothing wrong,‚Äù I began, hoping she didn't counter my statement.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be honest, I can't help feeling you don't take this organization seriously.‚Äù

‚ÄúI signed-up, didn't I?‚Äù I offered, trying to placate the woman.¬†

‚ÄúI wish that was enough,‚Äù she said, with almost sorrow in her voice, like this was hurting her more than it was me. ‚ÄúBut because we are short volunteers, I will let you off with a warning. We have another meeting in a few weeks. I expect to see you there *on time*.‚Äù¬†

Then she hung up.¬†

I was instantly annoyed. She expected to see me *on time*? Who did she think she was?¬†

I slammed down my phone, only to hear it ring again.¬†

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I grumbled into the receiver.¬†

‚ÄúYou have a guest,‚Äù the caller said in a gruff voice.¬†

‚ÄúEliseo?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYou have a guest,‚Äù he repeated, then added, ‚ÄúGet your ass up here in the lobby.‚Äù

I shook off the irritation I still felt and ran back up front. I expected to see the receptionist candidate, though she was extremely early. I didn‚Äôt see her though. There were a couple of clients gathered at the front desk, talking with Eliseo, but no interviewee. I started towards them when I noticed someone else sitting in one of the guest chairs.¬†

Immediately, I recognized the dark-brown hair, beautiful green eyes and handsome face‚Äîit was Bradley.

1o8c47t,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1o8c47t/my_lo_told_me_he_has_agoraphobia/,My LO told me he has agoraphobia.,"That pulled me in, because I had agoraphobia really bad in college. I was so lonely and none of my peers ever really checked on me (because I was self-isolating, of course), so when I met this guy who has it decades later, I guess I felt like I should try to be the person I needed someone else to be back then. I don't have that ""I can save him"" mindset, or at least I don't think I do. I just wished someone had seen me when I was isolating, and I try to treat others the way I want to be treated. I want to be a friendly face who has been there before and gets it.

He's really nice to me. He goes out of his way to say hi and hug me if I happen to bump into him (he walks his dog past my regular coffee spot sometimes, which is how we met; the dog ran up to me while I was sitting outside and we got to chatting). I mean, he *lights up* when he sees me. I guess that's where the limerence started, really, the face he made when I bumped into him months after the first time we talked. Nobody looks at me like that. So I started drinking more coffee, hoping to see him more often, lol.

Unfortunately, I guess being afraid of people because of agoraphobia includes me, so he keeps me at arms' length at the same time that he says all the shit that would normally lead to a relationship, which is unintentionally making me go insane. This guy is remembering tiny details I mentioned in passing months ago and asking me follow-up questions, asking me what I'm up to later, saying ""I was just thinking about you!"", telling me I'm his *hero* because I related my experience with agoraphobia, and then... that's it. I dunno. I think he tries hard and then panics right at the point where we would normally take it to the next step, and I can *see* him start to panic and it makes me panic and retreat, too.

I gave him my number because I figured it would be less pressure than asking him for his, but he never called. The next time I saw him after that, he just peered at me from halfway around a corner for about ten straight seconds and then went the other way. I figured, damn, he doesn't like me anymore since I gave him my number. My therapist pointed out that if you *genuinely* dislike someone you've caught a glimpse of and want to avoid them, you would immediately duck and go the other way, not stare at them that long. So I dunno. Probably he panicked because he literally has a panic disorder, and my own social anxiety is just filling in the blanks with ""he hates me now.""

Both of us are in therapy. I'm sorting my own shit out even as I hope that he'll have a breakthrough, so whether or not he ever gets it together, I'll be okay. ...I think. But man, I wish I could just be normal about him.",2,1760634857.0,limerence,1,1.0,False

It was half buried under a stack of papyrus and cloth. The man selling it spoke no English, but seemed more than happy to part with it. He wouldn't even touch it. It only cost a couple of bucks. I slipped it into my bag as I kept shopping and ultimately forgot about it.

That was two months ago. Since then, I've made it back home. North Africa was spectacular, and I brought home so many cool things! Only when I fully unpacked did I rediscover the journal.

The reason I bought it was the English name on the spine. Albert Fincher. I've done a little research, but I can't find anything about this guy.

Anyway, this thing is very odd. It has a... faintly unsettling smell, reminiscent of the artifacts I saw when in Cairo. I'm going to type up what I find here, so maybe someone can help me figure out who this fellow was.

I'll let the journal speak for itself.

*January 5th, 1923*

I have made it to Cairo. I won't lie, the dust is suffocating. There are certain pleasantries here, the spices and scenery being some examples, but I have already grown tired of the pompous Brits. They are insufferable. Shops and streets swarm with their kind, and they ride by in their automobiles, like kings, inspecting newly dominated lands.

While I walked to my lodgings, I heard no less than seven groups of locals chanting Carter's name. Some hero indeed, pillaging their artifacts for what? The betterment of England. Sickening. I plan on finding something even bigger than Tutankhamun. Howard Carter and all his cronies won't know what to think when a ""Yank"" shows him up.

I have employed the help of man named Winton Harrison. He is English, but swears no fealty to ilk of their kind. I'm inclined to like the man. He tells me of ruins seen from afar. U*ntouched ruins*. It sounds too good to be true, but I must endeavor a look at them.

Tomorrow promises the beginning of *my* legend.

*January 7th, 1923*

Yesterday was a disaster. It didn't begin that way, but as God saw fit, everything fell apart.

I awoke Saturday to a beautiful, clear day. With a little coffee and a splash of whiskey, I was ready to set out. Thank the Lord for Winton. He had a full team ready for me.

We spent most of the good daylight trudging toward our destination. I knew there must be more to the Valley of the Kings than what Carter had found. With that thought, we headed towards the far end. I had no interest in the Brits seeing what I was doing. Still don't.

Shortly before nightfall, we made it to our first stop. I don't want to share any knowledge with people who could get back to Carter. Therefore, we were going downriver for some time before we loaded onto a barge.

My luck struck bad, roughly three hours into our ride. The barge ran aground on a sand bar. The old thing cracked open, sending much of our supplies plunging deep into the dark waters of the Nile. I barely got to shore myself.

Winton lost six men, and I lost twelve capable diggers. We are camped on the bank for now. Winton assures me he can arrange for another barge, but we have already been waiting a full day. Is this over before it truly began?

*January 12th, 1923*

I could not stand that insufferable barge a moment longer. We have made it just north of the town of Sohag. I sent Winton and some of his men into the town to resupply and gather camels. With a bit of gumption, we may make it to the northern point of the valley by nightfall. Winton will be leaving me soon. I hope my trust in him has been well placed.

*January 14th, 1923*

Winton did not lie. This place is littered with ruins. Early this morning we found no less than five different columns, each covered in elaborate script. I have never been adept at the language, but my helpful workers say they can read it. The dig is set to begin tomorrow morning.

Winton left a short while ago. I shall miss his company, but he assures me all will be well. He told me this was our secret. That none dared to come here before.

I can only imagine the riches I shall find.

*January 15th, 1923*

Today proved to be better than my wildest imaginations. While inspecting the area around the columns, I discovered a drop that led straight to a chamber.

The exterior of the chamber was covered in more of the hieroglyphs. The workers have refused to tell me the meaning. I have copied them down as best as I could. I will study them at a later date.

ìÖììÑøìáå ìèèìâîìÖ±ìã¥ìÖÇ ìÖÉìâîìÖ± ìèèìÇãìÖÇìã¥ìä™ìÑøìã¥ìã¥ ìÜëìÖÇìÖÇìÉ≠ ìèèìâîìÖÇ ìÖÉìÇãìÑøìèèìâî ìÖ±ìÜë ìÑøìàñìÖ≤ìÉÄìáãìã¥

The hired help seemed to stall outside of the chamber, many of them walking away, but I continued in. There are hundreds of artifacts down there. So many that, I may need to hire more people. When this discovery hits the papers, I am going to dominate these annoying Brits.

Tomorrow, I will have workers start cataloguing each find. While they do that, I shall go deeper. This chamber seems to have no end.

*January 16th, 1923*

There is so much to write about, yet my thoughts are foggy. I have had an interesting day.

Initially, the workers would not enter, yet again. I tried to speak with them, but they are a rather reserved bunch. When I made promise of short shifts, they folded. If they had not helped, all would have been near impossible.

We were able to make much progress on the antechamber, for that is what it was.

The true prize, however, lay beyond: a burial chamber. An elaborate sarcophagus lay in the middle, surrounded by gold-plated treasures beyond measure. It was surrounded by two massive statues depicting Anubis.

Gorgeous things, but menacing nonetheless.

When I asked for help, the workers yet again refused. I threatened to replace them all. They did the unthinkable and left. Every one of them just packed up, and left. Their faces were etched with what looked like fear. I'm not sure what to make of it.

With Winton and all of the men gone, I should feel worry. Yet, the silence brings peace. I am alone, but I am happy. Winston said he would return in a fortnight, though unease feels my weary bones. I have ample supplies to last until then. Tomorrow, I will open this sarcophagus and lay eyes on the wonder inside. Perhaps I will work on my studies before bed. I need to be able to read these hieroglyphs.

*January 17th, 1923*

I awoke very early this morning. A chill was in the air, and I swear there was a voice carrying on the breeze. I couldn't make out any words, but it sounded as if someone was pleading. My mind is getting the better of me. I think today I will rest. My hands are sore, and ache as if swollen. I will stay above and pack some of the smaller artifacts for transportation. I am rather tired.

**Sorry for the interruption!** I just wanted to jump in and say, I still haven‚Äôt turned up anything about Albert Fincher. I might look into this Winton Harrison guy next. He seems to appear a lot in the journal. Anywho, I'll keep you updated if I find something! Here are the last of the journal entries, though they are getting harder to read. His handwriting is getting sloppy.

*January 18th, 1923*

I am struggling alone. It has been but a few days and already my mind feels fragile.

Last night I had a terrible dream. I was pulled into the burial chamber, driven by a need to open the sarcophagus. When I finally did, it was empty. There was a foul smell emitting from it. The entire chamber filled with the vile scent. I remember nothing after that.

Upon waking, I found myself covered in dust. My hands have taken a turn for the worse. The nails are yellowing and the skin feels tight. I worry that the dry air is taking a toll upon me. My throat feels as if it's been coated in shards of glass. I can't afford another day of rest. I must continue.

*January 19th, 1923*

My feet and legs are in excruciating pain now as well. I can barely move, but work must continue.

I was able to get into the tomb. It was open, and the foul smell was nauseating. I will not go back again. Pain everywhere. It is so dry out here.

*Jan 23rd*

I am afraid. The smell is above ground now. The wind does no dispel it. My legs and right arm are all but useless. The skin is blackened and hard to the touch. Thankfully my left hand is not as bad. I must get help, yet I remain alone. 

I pray Winton returns early. For now, I must wait.

**Sorry for interrupting** again, but this next part is in horrible shape! It is the last entry, and he he seems to have been barely alive when writing it. I'll copy over what I can.

*Feb 5th* (I think? It is very hard to read)

Hand is bad. Something talks to me, cant understand. The smell-

Tell my love that I regret everyth- (must have been everything, though the rest is illegible)

If I co- (could?) over again, I would leave it all to Carter.

Winton hasn't come. No more wate (Water?)

\---

Hello! That was the last of it. I keep hoping this is some clever fake, but it feels all too real. This poor man‚Ä¶ he must have died horribly.

Oh, I almost forgot! I did a bit of digging on Winton Harrison. Turns out he helped British archaeologists locate exquisitely preserved mummies. Strange, though‚Ä¶ he vanished in the northern Valley of the Kings in 1928. Shortly after, another perfectly preserved mummy was found nearby.

Surprisingly, she was able to convince the Living National Treasure performers to expose their puppets to the elements, and captured an uniquely uncanny and arresting production. Nearly impossible to find, Brooklyn-based puppet collective We Wiggle Dolls has obtained a copy ripped from DVD, and restored it visually as close to its theatrical release as possible!

Every successful entrepreneur says it. My mentor won't shut up about it. But I'm an introvert and networking events make me miserable.  
I don't struggle with talking about my business. I can explain what I do fine. It's everything else. The forced enthusiasm. The superficial ""we should totally collaborate"" conversations that go nowhere. Collecting business cards from people you'll never contact. Standing around with a drink trying to look approachable while internally calculating how early you can leave. I see extroverts working the room like it's effortless and I'm in the corner having an out of body experience from the sheer exhaustion of being ""on"" for two hours.  
The few times I've forced myself to really put myself out there and talk to lots of people, I come home completely drained and need like three days to recover. If I'm supposed to do this regularly I'll never get actual work done. So for introverts who've figured this out: what's your real strategy? Are you just suffering through traditional networking? Did you find alternatives that work better for your personality? One on one coffee meetings? Online networking? Something else entirely? I'm trying different approaches. Been practicing small talk and quick pitches with gleam which helps me feel more prepared at least. Set small goals like ""talk to three people then you can leave.""

Here is the long version. This is a person who came to the US on a B-1 visa. Two years later married someone and got a green card. Two months after she got married, her husband abandoned her. Because she did not know many people and her English is not very good, I have been helping her along the way and became friends.  A week ago, she asked to travel with me, so I arranged the hotel and trip itinerary (because she did not have a US credit card).  She did not want to pay the rental car and I did not want to drive my own car, so we agreed to drive her car and I would fill her tank in full before the trip.  To go along with her schedule, I had to pay child care while I was away. She was 50 minutes late to pick me up and still demanded to pick up a free coffee before our departure. Because she wanted rest more, I drove most of the trip. When we canoed in the lake, I was also the one who did most of the rowing.  She also did not bring any cash, so I had to pay the tips first and then asked her to transfer $ to my account (she was reluctant). Long story short, the trip (first time we were traveling together) quickly turned ugly. Near the end, she started to yell at me for not telling how many miles left to the next scenic Overlook. When I told her the map did not show, she said I should know everything and help her, because she was new to the US. In the heat of the fight she stopped next to a corn field 200 miles from my city for 1 hour and asked to get off her car.  She continued her verbal abuse and asked me to pay more money or she would kick me off the car.  It was apparent she was going to her own house straight instead of dropping me at my house. So at the rest area, I moved to the driver seat and asked if I can drive myself (to my house). She went nuts and became physical and scratched my neck. Police came. He acknowledged the scratch and did not give me a report. He said he was going to put notes in the computer system. If I wanted to file an assault charge, I need to go the the Sheriff's office in person next day. He asked me if I am ok to stay in her car. I said yes, but I added I need her to drop me at my house.  But the police officer said it is not illegal for my ""friend"" to drop me on the side of the road.  It was not too bad that she was willing to drop me at her house (15 minutes from mine). I should call a taxi from there and go home. As soon as my ""friend"" heard what the police said, she rushed to the trunk and took my luggage out on the parking lot of the highway rest area (90 miles from my home).  Finally, the police had to persuade her to put the luggage back.

I am seriously thinking about filing an assault charge against her.  I have to admit up until this incident, my life was peaceful - work, taking care of kids etc. I had never yelled at or had physical fight with friends and never had any encounter with law enforcement. It's even embarrassing to tell the story to my other friends, hence I posted here. I regretted letting this person in my life. She came from a different world. From what I know, both she and her husband had called police to their home multiple times. (Now I understand why).  The only adult I shared this story with told me not to file an assault charge because it is ""not worth it."" (The Sheriff's office is 1 hour drive away) But I feel I was mistreated and traumatized by this person and really wanted her to take responsibility for what she did. I did not have severe physical injury, but the time when she tried to drag me out of the car was frightening.

If I file the assault charge, what does that lead to? Do I need to go to the court?

1o8bkjn,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1o8bkjn/best_vpn_to_watch_nfl/,Best VPN to Watch NFL,"It's Sunday afternoon, your team is playing a crucial divisional matchup, and you're staring at a frustrating message: ""This game is not available in your area."" Despite paying for multiple streaming subscriptions, NFL blackout restrictions have locked you out of the action. You're not alone‚Äîmillions of football fans face this same problem every season.

The 2025 NFL season presents unprecedented streaming challenges. With games scattered across **six different platforms**‚Äîincluding YouTube TV, Prime Video, Peacock, Paramount+, ESPN, and Netflix‚Äîwatching every game can cost upward of **$800 per season**. Add regional blackout restrictions designed to protect local broadcast rights, and even dedicated fans struggle to catch their favorite teams.

Fortunately, there's a solution that addresses both accessibility and privacy concerns: a **premium VPN service**. But not all VPNs deliver the speed, reliability, and security needed for high-quality NFL streaming. This guide explores the technical requirements for streaming NFL content securely and identifies the best VPN options for the 2025 season.

# Why NFL Fans Need a VPN for Streaming

# Understanding NFL Blackout Restrictions

NFL blackouts aren't designed to frustrate fans‚Äîthey exist due to complex broadcasting agreements between networks, local affiliates, and the league itself. In 2025, blackout restrictions primarily stem from **exclusive regional broadcast rights** rather than the historical ticket sales model.

Here's how blackouts work: if you're within a **75-mile radius** of a stadium where a game is being played, that game may be unavailable on certain streaming platforms to protect local TV stations' exclusive rights. Similarly, out-of-market games‚Äîmatchups featuring teams from outside your geographic region‚Äîare often restricted to protect services like NFL Sunday Ticket.

# Privacy and Security Concerns with Streaming

Beyond access issues, streaming NFL games raises legitimate privacy and security concerns:

* **ISP Throttling**: Internet service providers frequently throttle bandwidth when they detect high-volume video streaming, resulting in buffering and quality degradation during crucial plays
* **Data Collection**: Streaming platforms track viewing habits, location data, and device information
* **Public Wi-Fi Vulnerabilities**: Watching games at airports, hotels, or coffee shops exposes your connection to potential security threats
* **Geographic Surveillance**: Your IP address reveals your location to every service you access

A quality VPN addresses these concerns by **encrypting your internet traffic** with military-grade AES-256 encryption, masking your IP address, and preventing ISPs from throttling your connection based on streaming activity.

# Technical Requirements for VPN-Based NFL Streaming

Not every VPN can handle live sports streaming effectively. NFL broadcasts demand significant bandwidth, especially for HD and 4K content. Here's what you need:

# Speed and Performance Benchmarks

* **HD streaming (1080p)**: Minimum 9 Mbps download speed
* **4K streaming**: Minimum 25 Mbps download speed
* **Recommended VPN speed retention**: 85%+ of your baseline connection

Free VPNs typically operate on overcrowded servers with insufficient bandwidth, resulting in constant buffering, pixelated video, and connection drops during critical moments. Premium services invest in high-capacity infrastructure specifically optimized for streaming.

# Essential VPN Features for NFL Fans

When evaluating VPNs for NFL streaming, prioritize these technical capabilities:

**Extensive US Server Network**: Access to servers in multiple US cities enables you to connect to different regional markets. More servers mean less congestion and better performance during peak viewing hours.

**Advanced Protocol Support**: Modern protocols like **WireGuard** and its variants offer superior speed-to-security ratios compared to older options like OpenVPN. These protocols maintain encryption while minimizing latency.

**Obfuscation Technology**: Streaming platforms employ sophisticated VPN detection systems. Obfuscated servers disguise VPN traffic as regular HTTPS traffic, helping maintain reliable access.

**Smart DNS Capabilities**: Some devices (smart TVs, gaming consoles, Apple TV) don't natively support VPN apps. Smart DNS features enable geo-unblocking on these devices without compromising your entire network.

**Kill Switch Protection**: If your VPN connection drops unexpectedly, a kill switch immediately halts internet traffic, preventing your real IP address from being exposed.

# Best VPN for Watching NFL: NordVPN

After extensive testing of VPN performance across multiple NFL streaming platforms in 2025, **NordVPN** consistently delivers the optimal combination of speed, reliability, and security for football fans.

# Why NordVPN Leads for NFL Streaming

**Unmatched US Server Infrastructure**: NordVPN operates **7,400+ servers across 118 countries**, including approximately **2,000 servers strategically distributed across 16 US states**. This extensive network provides flexibility for accessing different regional broadcasts and ensures low-latency connections during Sunday afternoon games.

The service offers servers in major football markets including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas, and Miami, allowing you to connect to the specific city where your desired game is being broadcast.

**Industry-Leading Speed Performance**: In independent testing, NordVPN achieves average connection speeds of **461-469 Mbps** with a **94-96% speed retention rate**. This means minimal performance degradation even when connected to distant servers‚Äîcritical for streaming 4K broadcasts without buffering.

These speeds are powered by **NordLynx**, the company's proprietary protocol built on the WireGuard framework. NordLynx delivers the throughput necessary for ultra-high-definition streaming while maintaining robust encryption standards.

**SmartPlay Technology**: NordVPN's SmartPlay feature automatically combines VPN security with Smart DNS functionality. This hybrid approach ensures seamless access to geo-restricted content without requiring manual configuration, even on devices that don't traditionally support VPN applications.

**Proven Unblocking Capabilities**: Testing confirms NordVPN successfully accesses all major NFL streaming platforms in 2025, including:

* DAZN (for NFL Game Pass International)
* YouTube TV (Sunday Ticket)
* Paramount+ (CBS games)
* Prime Video (Thursday Night Football)
* Peacock (Sunday Night Football)
* Hulu + Live TV

**Security Without Compromise**: Beyond streaming performance, NordVPN maintains rigorous security standards:

* **Independently audited no-logs policy**
* **AES-256-GCM encryption** with Perfect Forward Secrecy
* **Automatic kill switch** on all platforms
* **DNS leak protection** and IPv6 leak prevention
* **Split tunneling** for selective application routing

# Practical Advantages for NFL Fans

**Device Compatibility**: NordVPN supports **10 simultaneous connections**, allowing you to secure multiple devices with a single subscription. Native apps are available for Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Linux, Fire TV, Android TV, and more.

**Customer Support**: 24/7 live chat support with knowledgeable representatives who understand streaming-specific configurations and troubleshooting.

**Risk-Free Trial Period**: A **30-day money-back guarantee** enables thorough testing throughout early-season games without financial commitment.

**Cost-Effective Pricing**: Long-term plans start at approximately **$3.09-3.29 per month**, making it significantly more affordable than subscribing to multiple streaming services. This represents a fraction of the $800+ annual cost of comprehensive US-based NFL coverage.

# Alternative VPN Options

While NordVPN offers the most comprehensive solution, two alternatives merit consideration:

**Surfshark**: Provides **unlimited device connections** and competitive speeds (848+ Mbps in testing). Includes a built-in **GPS spoofing feature** particularly useful for accessing NFL+ (which uses GPS location tracking in addition to IP-based detection). Pricing starts around $1.99/month for long-term plans.

**ExpressVPN**: Premium option with **3,000+ servers in 105 countries** and excellent security credentials. Achieves speeds around 455 Mbps with 92% retention. Features **MediaStreamer** Smart DNS functionality. More expensive at approximately $6.67/month but offers superior customer support and marginally better privacy credentials for users in restrictive environments.

# Setting Up Your VPN for NFL Streaming

# Step-by-Step Configuration

1. **Select and Subscribe**: Choose a VPN service (NordVPN recommended) and complete the subscription process
2. **Download and Install**: Install the native application on your preferred streaming device
3. **Connect to Optimal Server**: Select a server in the city/state where your desired game is being broadcast
4. **Verify Connection**: Confirm your new IP address matches the target location
5. **Clear Browser Data**: Delete cookies and cache to ensure streaming platforms recognize your new location
6. **Access Streaming Platform**: Log into your NFL streaming service and begin watching

# Pro Tips for Optimal Performance

* **Connect to servers with lower load** (under 50% when displayed in the app) for best speeds
* **Use the NordLynx/WireGuard protocol** when available for maximum performance
* **Enable the kill switch** to prevent accidental IP leaks if the VPN disconnects
* **Test your connection** before kickoff to avoid last-minute troubleshooting

# Legal and Ethical Considerations

It's important to understand the legal landscape surrounding VPN usage for streaming:

**VPN Usage is Legal**: Using a VPN is perfectly legal in the United States and most Western countries. VPNs are legitimate privacy tools used by businesses, journalists, and security-conscious individuals worldwide.

**Terms of Service Awareness**: While VPN usage itself is legal, it may technically violate the Terms of Service of some streaming platforms. However, the typical consequence is IP address blocking rather than account suspension. Simply connecting to a different server usually resolves this issue.

**Informed Decision-Making**: This guide provides information to help you make educated choices about your privacy and streaming access. We encourage using VPNs primarily for their intended purpose: **protecting your online privacy and security**.

# Maximizing Your NFL Viewing Experience

A premium VPN does more than bypass geo-restrictions‚Äîit fundamentally improves your streaming security and quality:

* **Prevents ISP throttling** that degrades video quality during peak hours
* **Secures your connection** on public Wi-Fi networks at sports bars, airports, and hotels
* **Protects your viewing data** from collection and monetization by streaming platforms
* **Enables cost savings** by accessing international Game Pass options (DAZN Canada offers all 272 games for approximately $20/month compared to $800+ for US subscriptions)

# Conclusion: Take Control of Your NFL Streaming

The 2025 NFL season shouldn't be defined by blackout frustrations, excessive subscription costs, or compromised privacy. With the right VPN‚Äîparticularly **NordVPN** with its extensive server network, blazing speeds, and proven reliability‚Äîyou can enjoy every game with confidence.

Whether you're traveling internationally, living outside your favorite team's market, or simply seeking a more cost-effective streaming solution, a premium VPN provides the technical foundation for uninterrupted, high-quality NFL access while protecting your digital privacy.

The 2025 season is underway. Don't let geographic restrictions keep you from witnessing every touchdown, interception, and game-winning drive. Take control of your streaming experience with the protection and flexibility that only a premium VPN can provide.",1,1760633711.0,VPNforFreedom,0,1.0,False

I was prescribed macrogol with electrolytes (a common laxative/stool softener) to take with my daily iron pill, but it feels like it's doing absolutely nothing. My one-time success was thanks to one suppository that was handed to me by a nurse at the hospital. But she only gave me one ü•≤

1o8bex5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o8bex5,I Did It!,"Well everybody, I had completed my first marathon. Never being much of a runner or distance runner at that. I was sprinter in high school track. Max was the 800m. Never really kept up on constantly running. But I do tend to say I‚Äôm above average with capabilities and staying in shape. Having kids(5 & 1 ages) this 1 year-1&1/2 years I‚Äôve held fitness more accountable to be further present & able for the kids.

So heading into my marathon on October 12, September 21st i signed up. Not constantly running prior to that, but again, holding myself to above average fitness. 1 week before the run I fought a quad tightness, ankle kink & throat sickness. With those bumps in the road I didn‚Äôt have a full 4 weeks of disciplined training, also juggling kid schedules.

I decided to go at it. My longest long run ever had been 12 miles. Knowing I could easily reach the half marathon, I went for the full for my first event because everything was a new step past my known capabilities & thats why I did this. Push to the unknown and give my mental a challenge.

Many said i wouldn‚Äôt be able to complete it, laughed when I told them what my long run was & told me my run would be a long day. Of course, it wasn‚Äôt too short of a day once i completed.

Race week approached, with the bumps in the road, the external negativity, internal voices questionings. With an early start option & race cut off times at the 13.1 mile & 19 mile. Things got slightly nervous. But I had 6 hours to complete it & I told myself if I cant do it within that given time, I didn‚Äôt deserve to earn the completion accounting my short coming decision to run. While I contemplated deferring to the half, or even another event at a more distance time, every conclusion I came to, I would be failing myself. My fianc√© encourage me to stick with it.

Raceday, I had fianc√© & kids there to support me.

I had knocked out each cut off time well ahead of cut offs. My strategy was to ease up & save my energy for the uncharted territory midway & to the end. But also to keep pace and gain time in the first half before cut offs. My thinking was to beat those times, then anything after that I could take any time that was needed. Let me tell you, some time was needed.

At mile 16 quad cramps began. With starting a slight walk/run/stop stretch & rub it out  method getting implemented.

Then around mile 21/22 is where my leg pain set in. And heavy walk/run intervals started. This is where of course the proper training/strength training specially would have helped immensely. But I pushed thru.

My first half had me thinking I could complete it in the 4:15-4:30 time. My second half proved different. My final official time per the event was 5:30:17 with a 13:02 pace.

I recorded myself with RunGo, Strava & RaceJoy. All of which showed different times & distances ironically.

To me, for my expectations & never being at these distances before, it was too long of day, but nothing about five & a half hours is necessarily short. Once I finished I was ecstatic to eat anything possible. As my build up to raceweek/day I had carb loaded & ate as healthy as I could. But the hunger in the pit of my stomach desired to better my marathon time & take on farther distances. There is more to come with ahead of the horizon.

Some of my notable acquired gear:

-Solomon ADV Skin 12(could not have completed this without being able to hydrate at will) 2L pack in the back, with the front two 16oz bottles having Liquid IV & TruLabs mixtures. Refilled those with water at aid stations once I ran dry.

-The Sports shirt T-shirt, amazing non chaffing fabric.

-Orrinn Sport Toe sock(i believe prevented my feet from blisters at the uncharted miles)

-Body Glide stick(applied EVERYWHERE)

-Glukos liquid energy

-DateFix gu gel(F-ing delicious)

-Adidas ultra boost running shoes

I hope my story helps others.

The run I had completed was the Probility of Ann Arbor Marathon. Which supported mental health awareness in desire to E-Race the stigma. At packet pick up expo it was beautiful to see all the booths in support of mental health & suicide awareness. A booth had hearts to write names down and pin to our shirts during the run & that helped my mental immensely, to run for those whom we lost and are not here with us, though it had felt that they were along my side every step of the way.

If you‚Äôre looking for a place to start running. Look into Wings for life, this & the Redbull400 is what propelled me into these desires. Wings for life was such a unique & beautiful event. That you can participate in at an event run(flagship), or right out your front door. To run for those who can‚Äôt, where every penny goes to spinal cord injury research. Run in the biggest simultaneous running event in this world, I would love to take our steps or wheel rolls with you this coming May 10th, 2026. Registration open November 5th, 2025.

If you or anyone you know is struggling with mental health, please reach out. There is a massively strong community of support & you are not alone.

The first war is fought between the ears.

Everyday you wake up & your mind is already on time, if not early ahead of you.

Eliminate that glass ceiling.

Dip into your cookie jar.

Thank you to all those whom read this story of mine. To those who supported this first run endeavor. To David Goggins for much inspiration & content to read & listen to.

Merry Christmas.

1o8bb1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1o8bb1r/the_dots_connect/,The dots connect,"Hello. New here.¬† This all started after a very nasty breakup I just had where I was engaged and we had been together for 4.5 years. I knew I might never find closure of my own with him so I started doing my own research after I looked into attachment styles with a therapist. I learned that while I was the AP (anxious preoccupied) type, my ex is most definitely the FA (fearful Avoidant) type. Then I learned that FAs tend to have substance abuse issues and BPD. SUDDENLY all of the dots started connecting for me. I looked into this sub and even more dots started connecting. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôve had amnesia. I do distinctly remember when he told me about rehab, he was assessed for BPD but didn‚Äôt meet the criteria and I think it‚Äôs entirely possible that‚Äôs because he fits the ‚Äúdiscouraged‚Äù subtype which can hide exceedingly well in men or it often gets underdiagnosed. If you would indulge me by reading the entire post, I just want to know if any of this resonates. It could just be that I‚Äôm chair diagnosing someone when I am not a licensed therapist. I only have my experiences.   
  
It all started so sweetly and innocently. I had never felt so loved or seen by anyone in my entire life. This man came from a very affluent and well to do family who were very wealthy and well connected in the area we lived in. I was often intimidated by that as I come from a lower socioeconomic background (this becomes important later). He was all very reassuring and his family, while distant with me at first, grew to accept me about 3 years in. Perhaps they weren‚Äôt sure if I was sticking around long enough and in hindsight that should‚Äôve been a red flag. The first couple years everything was so normal. HE seemed normal. No real problems to speak of. He drank all the time but I grew up around plenty of alcoholics and while it was a boundary I had at first, I began to let it slide because ‚Äúno one‚Äôs perfect‚Äù and I‚Äôve seen alcoholics change. Perhaps another red flag I overlooked was the fact that he told me he was an addict who had been to rehab for an addiction to stimulants. Of which, I was prescribed at the time. Oof. I had never been with someone who suffers from addiction so in my naivete I just thought ‚ÄúEveryone makes mistakes. As long as you got the help that you needed.‚Äù. He knew I was prescribed adderall and in fact I‚Äôm a college student. So I asked him ‚ÄúIs the fact that I‚Äôm prescribed adderall something I should be concerned about?‚Äù and he was above board. Very reassuring. Told me that he loved me like he had never loved anyone in his life and wouldn‚Äôt even dream of touching it. In fact, he doesn‚Äôt even think about it. Y‚Äôknow. The way addicts just lie through their teeth.   
  
Those first 2 years we were together were some of the best in my life. No one had ever worshipped me the way he did. Practically just exalted me. Treated me like a queen. Bought me everything. Talked me up in front of his friends and my friends. How much he loved me. How much of a beautiful person I am. How he knew he wanted to marry me one day. We were like a power couple. It was like being in a romance novel. I was extremely happy. Then we moved in together and got engaged. That‚Äôs when it all unraveled. I wouldn‚Äôt know it at the time, but he began stealing from my prescription. Parts of his personality began to crack slowly but surely. He got more anti-social. He only wanted to drink beer and play PC games at his desk all day such that it became a chore to get him off of it. I thought it was a growing pain of the honeymoon phase ending. I didn‚Äôt see it as such a big deal because video games are a hobby and while I didn‚Äôt enjoy staring at a screen all day I just found my own hobbies to do and let him do his gaming without much fuss. I would work these dead end grueling jobs that he knew I hated. I drove a car that was on its last legs. He convinced me that it would be okay if I sold my car and just used his to get around because after all we were soon to be married. It was going to be okay if I trusted him financially. I was of course hesitant. So was my family. Yet slowly but surely he made us all feel safe for me to let my guard down. Why wouldn‚Äôt I trust the man I loved and wanted to marry? Then when my studies were getting harder as I entered my junior year of college I was growing frustrated at my job keeping me too long from studying. He convinced me the same way he convinced me to sell my car, that I could become a member of his family business to be on their superior health insurance and I could quit my job. I could stay home, just finish school, and graduate without any worries financially. I trusted him and just like that I was hooked. Dependent. A couple years go by. I of course experienced turmoil in our relationship which I would later learn is called the ‚Äúpush pull‚Äù. Then within the last 6 months together, it was like he could barely tolerate me. He had such disdain for me yet wouldn‚Äôt tell me. I could feel something was wrong but every time I asked I would get the same reassurance that everything would be fine. It was like being in a relationship with Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. He started pointing out my flaws to me but would apologize later on and say he would be ‚Äúa better man‚Äù. My birthday passed and we didn‚Äôt do anything fancy. Just some friends over for a backyard BBQ. He stayed in his game room most of that time. Came out only every so often to talk to my friends about how excited he was to finally marry me after this last semester that I had left to go etc etc and all the other things he used to say. It gave me that reassured feeling again that everything was fine and I had nothing to worry about.  
  
Then the breakup happens. I‚Äôm sitting on the couch watching my kdrama. He‚Äôs at his desk drinking and crying over a song he just heard. I comfort him. He asks if I want to go to the gun range. I ask him to make me a coffee first. He EXPLODES. An anger from him that I have truly never seen before. It was so cold. So demonic it was like a demon possessed him. ‚ÄúWhat do you even bring to my life? You don‚Äôt make me happy. I don‚Äôt feel loved.‚Äù just shouting and he‚Äôs never shouted at me like that before. I grew very afraid then very numb. I handed him my ring and walked away. He went through my phone. Found a conversation between me and my sister where I told her what was going on that he would then use as ammo that I was ‚Äútalking shit‚Äù or being ‚Äúungrateful‚Äù for the support he and his family gave me financially. Like that was just what he needed to get out of our relationship. He says he wants to breakup but he needs time to think. He goes on the week-long work trip. Texts me that he still wants to breakup so I pack my stuff during that time and leave thinking my absence would make him reconsider. It doesn‚Äôt. In fact he felt relieved and happy. Then the breakup by text messages continues. It was so shocking to have someone go from loving and warm to cold and almost calculating overnight. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just too dependent on me. I wanted to be your partner not your parent. I still love you but I‚Äôm no longer IN love with you. If you met another man who loves you just the way you are, I would be happy for you. I told my friends and family that I can‚Äôt see a future without you but right now things just aren‚Äôt working out. We had no real problems but the relationship feels hollow‚Äù. Mind y‚Äôall my birthday was a week prior to this where he was being all love-y dove-y to my parents and friends. So I got whiplash.   
  
I won‚Äôt go into how I found out he was stealing from my prescription for years as this post was already too long. Just that I did find out. I told his family thinking they would put him in rehab. They didn‚Äôt. In fact on the ring camera it just looked like he was laughing at the fact I told his family on him. So demonic. Then the next thing I know he downloads tinder while my name is still on the lease which sent me spiraling. Like how do you even do that to someone you supposedly loved for 4.5 years?? Who the fuck have I been with this entire time?? Reading this sub has made me think however, that I should be grateful if he ‚Äúmonkey branches‚Äù to someone else to fill the void so I could heal in peace. I‚Äôve never been so betrayed like this in my god damn life. I should want nothing to do with him any more and yet I just wonder if he was always like this or the drugs only exacerbated things. Because before he got ahold of my prescription, he was fucking normal I swear.¬† ¬† ",3,1760633152.0,BPDlovedones,6,0.81,False

I enjoyed it for the past few weeks, but I always see people use Cafiza (or other cleaners) for backflushing and I honestly feel that it is a bit over kill for regular use.

Some background: I am a doing a science major in university, heavily dependant on chemistry. The main components of Cafiza are Sodium Carbonate and Sodium Carbonate Peroxide. now they do a good for cafe's because they make a ton of coffee and cant clean their machine often enough without it and the peroxide oxidizes the oils and helps with heavy build up. I feel though that if you do water backflush between uses abd once a week remove the shower screen to clean with dish soap and do Sodium Carbonate backflush (which is way cheaper) you really don't need cafiza.

Nothing elaborate of course basically just carpentry type stuff.  Floating shelves, Anna White Coffee Bar, cutting boards, plant stand from Wood magazine, outdoor planters, stuff like that.

  
I have a the old Rigid hybrid saw they don't sell anymore and an Incra 1000 miter gauge for it.

I keep seeing crosscut sleds pushed as ""essential"" for use on a table saw.  I must be missing something because I don't see why.  Wouldn't putting a cut of MDF or 1/2 plywood that extends past the blade on my Miter gauge accomplish the same thing with less fuss?  There is a stop block system built into the miter gauge, and as long as you don't cut through you have the kerf cut to see where the blade will be cutting to get accurate cross cuts.

The only issue I could maybe see is cutting dowels but I must be missing something.

  
It just seems simpler to keep the miter gauge square to the blade with the microadjustments built into it, instead of worrying about the sled coming out of square as they all eventually will.",1,1760633094.0,BeginnerWoodWorking,3,1.0,False

**The Supreme Court seems open to handing Donald Trump and Republicans a staggering victory: A big, new, long-term advantage in elections for the House of Representatives.**                          
                 
- Ever since President Donald Trump took office in January, the Supreme Court‚Äôs conservative majority has seemed [hell-bent on thanking him](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/16/us/politics/supreme-courts-shadow-docket.html) for hand-picking several of their members. Their gratitude was on display today, when those conservatives expressed openness to flamb√©ing the historic Voting Rights Act. To be clear, conservatives don‚Äôt wanna scrap voting rights *entirely* ‚Äî just an [extremely crucial part](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/15/supreme-court-voting-rights-act-argument-00608340), in a change that could help Republicans maintain control of the House for a generation.                          
                 
- Such a ruling could supercharge Trump‚Äôs efforts to push red states to redraw their election maps to elect more of his allies into the House. Gutting the act would remove a key barrier that has blocked Republican politicians in Southern states from effectively wiping out about a dozen majority-minority districts. If that happens, Republicans might be able to lose the popular vote decisively but still win a majority in the House.                          
                 
- The case in question focuses on one district in Louisiana, which was [recently redrawn](https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-louisiana-voting-rights-redistricting-c9381da4dc06adebfe98ef3e161398f1?utm_source=copy&utm_medium=share) to better represent the majority Black community that had been represented by white Republicans for more than three decades. A Democrat won the seat, and some white residents argued that they were discriminated against. So, the Supreme Court is considering reversing the part of the Voting Rights Act that has been interpreted to require the creation of majority-minority districts.                          
                 
- Liberals warn that dismantling the law would allow politicians to redraw districts to their own benefit, but not help remedy historic discrimination. Conservatives seem open to imposing a time limit on using race to determine district lines: ‚ÄúThey should have an end point,‚Äù Justice Brett Kavanaugh said during the oral arguments.                          
                 
**This case is a very big deal for the future of elections in the United States.**                          
                 
- It‚Äôs unclear if the Supreme Court will rule in time for the midterms next year. (Such decisions are typically released in the summer after the oral argument ‚Äî which would be just months before the November 2026 midterms.) But there is at least a chance that Republicans could be allowed to reshape districts across the country in this next election, dramatically lowering Democrats‚Äô chances of winning back the House.                          
                 
- ‚ÄúThe new seats would eventually be enough to make Republicans favored to win the House even if they lost the popular vote by a wide margin,‚Äù Nate Cohn, chief political analyst for the *New York Times*, wrote today. ‚ÄúWith those new seats added to the ones Republicans already seem poised to gain, the House would not be competitive in most election years.‚Äù                          
                 
- When President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act in 1965, he declared: ‚ÄúToday is a triumph for freedom as huge as any victory that has ever been won on any battlefield.‚Äù Six decades later, justices hand-picked by a convicted felon might reverse that victory.                          
                 
**‚ÄúThis is an affront to every community that has fought, marched and bled for the right to vote,‚Äù Rep. Yvette Clarke (D-NY), chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, told reporters today.**

1o8b7hu,https://www.reddit.com/r/PackAndGo/comments/1o8b7hu/best_places_to_visit_in_italy_in_may/,Best Places to Visit in Italy in May,"I remember standing in Rome's Villa Borghese at 7 AM in early May‚Äîthe gardens still draped in morning mist, a handful of early risers scattered like careful brushstrokes across the lawns. A woman in a linen dress was sketching the fountains. An elderly couple held hands on a stone bench, speaking in hushed Italian. Above us, the sky was that particular shade of blue that only exists in May, somewhere between promise and memory.

This is what May in Italy offers: the main attractions without the crowds, the summer warmth without the oppressive heat, and the gardens at their absolute peak. It's the sweet spot where you can actually *breathe* in Venice, where the Colosseum doesn't feel like a medieval traffic jam, and where you can sit in a piazza with a coffee that costs ‚Ç¨1.50 instead of the ‚Ç¨6 gouging of August.

May is when Italy feels like it belongs to you and a few thousand carefully chosen people‚Äînot millions.

# Why May Is The Month Everything Changes

May strikes a harmonious balance between favorable weather and manageable crowds. This isn't just pleasant timing‚Äîit's the difference between an Italy you'll remember with fondness and an Italy you'll remember as a sweaty, crowded blur.

The numbers tell the story. May offers warm, sunny days and mild evenings ideal for outdoor activities and sightseeing, with fewer crowds while still offering ideal conditions for visiting major Italian cities, since it isn't yet summer weather or high season. The temperatures sit in that Goldilocks zone‚Äînorthern cities like Milan and Venice experience average highs of 20-25¬∞C (68-77¬∞F), while southern destinations such as Rome and Naples boast warmer temperatures ranging from 22-27¬∞C (72-81¬∞F).

But the weather is just the opening act. May in Italy means something deeper: it means spring's final hurrah‚Äîflowers bursting from every window box, mountains still visible across the countryside, markets overflowing with artichokes and tender asparagus that arrived last week. Indulge in freshly harvested artichokes, tender asparagus, and sweet strawberries, which feature prominently in springtime dishes.

And perhaps most importantly for travelers on a budget: May offers an opportunity for budget-conscious travelers to experience Italy's charms without the hefty price tags associated with peak summer. Accommodation prices and airfares are still reasonable, allowing you to stretch your travel dollars further.

# Where to Go: The Essential Five

# Rome: The City as It Was Meant to Be Seen

Rome in May is what postcards wish they could capture. The Colosseum still stands as arguably the world's most powerful ruin, but now you can actually spend time with it rather than simply rushing through. The light hits the ancient stones differently each hour‚Äîgolden at 7 AM, almost white at noon, rose-tinted before sunset.

The Colosseum in Rome, along with the Duomo in Florence and the canals of Venice, can be enjoyed at a more leisurely pace. Wander through the Roman Forum early in the morning when the only sound is your footsteps and the occasional bird call. Sit on the Spanish Steps when they're not a human carpet of postcards being sold.

But Rome in May rewards those who venture beyond the tourist triangle. Villa Borghese becomes an open-air museum where you might spend two hours simply wandering, stumbling upon a sculpture garden or a building covered in faded Renaissance frescoes. Trastevere, across the Tiber, transforms into exactly what a Roman neighborhood should be‚Äîlocals in cafes, laundry strung between buildings, restaurant owners sweeping their storefronts.

**When to go:** May 1-10 has the lightest crowds; mid-to-late May sees more Europeans arriving but still manageable.

**Key experience:** Attend an evening aperitivo in a neighborhood piazza, watching the city transition from day to night while sipping a Spritz that costs what it actually should.

# Florence: Gardens in Full Bloom

If Rome is about history, Florence is about beauty distilled into a city. And May is when the city reveals all its cards. The famous museums‚Äîthe Uffizi, the Accademia with Michelangelo's David‚Äîstill require booking, but you won't feel like you're in a scrum of humanity.

Florence's gardens, like the Boboli Gardens, are in full bloom, bringing the city to life, and May's longer days allow more time for sightseeing and enjoying glorious sunsets from Piazzale Michelangelo. Climb to Piazzale Michelangelo on a May evening and you'll understand why Renaissance artists spent their lives trying to capture light. The entire valley spreads below you in the golden hour‚Äîcypress trees, terracotta roofs, the Duomo glowing in the distance.

Beyond Florence's center, Tuscany beckons. Small towns like Siena, Lucca, and the hilltop villages that once terrified invaders are now peaceful enough for afternoon wandering. Visit in summer and between the heat, the crowds and lack of parking, places like Lucca and Siena become a nightmare ‚Äì but in May, it's still pleasant to get around.

**When to go:** Mid-May onwards; avoid May 1st Labor Day when museums are closed.

**Hidden gem:** Skip the major restaurants in the center. Ask your hotel staff to direct you to a neighborhood trattoria‚Äîyou'll eat better, spend less, and share space with actual Florentines.

# The Amalfi Coast: Cliffs, Lemons, and Coastal Magic

The Amalfi Coast presents a particular challenge in travel writing: how do you describe something that has been photographed and painted and written about until language runs out of fresh adjectives?

Here's what I'll tell you: it's even more dramatic than the photos suggest. The roads wind through cliffsides with such nauseating beauty that you'll need to stop frequently‚Äîwhich is perfect, because that's where the magic happens. In a pullout overlooking Positano, in a lemon grove outside Ravello, in a small beach where locals gather because tourists haven't found it yet.

The Amalfi Coast gets quite a lot of traffic in summer as the high season approaches, so visiting in spring is good for avoiding the crowds. Positano still glows in May‚Äîwhite buildings tumbling down cliffs to a turquoise Mediterranean‚Äîbut you can actually navigate its narrow streets without feeling like a sardine in a very expensive can. Ravello floats above it all, genuinely peaceful in the evenings after day-trippers leave.

The lemon trees (limoncello stands everywhere, naturally) smell almost aggressively fresh. In Southern Regions like the Amalfi Coast, the sun feels gentle and revitalizing, with its pleasant warmth on your skin as you enjoy morning cappuccino on a private terrace, the air carrying the sweet scent of citrus blossoms.

**When to go:** May 1-15 for the quietest experience; book accommodations immediately.

**Strategic booking window:** The Amalfi Coast books up fast. This is the first ideal moment to lock in your reservations‚Äîwhen prices are reasonable but before the summer rush. [Browse hotels and compare availability here](https://expedia.com/affiliate/U51Zc8j) to find your perfect cliffside perch.

# Venice: The Canals Belong to You Again

Venice has a reputation for being overcrowded, and in July-August, that reputation is accurate. But May presents a different Venice‚Äîone where the canals feel like they belong to residents again, not exclusively to selfie sticks.

The canals of Venice can be enjoyed at a more leisurely pace. Take a vaporetto (water bus) at odd hours‚Äî6 AM, or after 8 PM‚Äîand the city reveals its actual rhythms. Watch fishermen unload their morning catch. Hear the echo of footsteps across bridges when the tour groups are at dinner. Wander into churches with no crowds, where light filters through stained glass onto your face alone.

The Venice Biennale 2025 runs from May 10-November 23, bringing world-class contemporary art to the city's pavilions and spaces. Even if you're not a dedicated art-world person, the buzz adds energy. Plus, the International Architecture Exhibition exploring how architecture combats climate change feels timely while walking through a city increasingly threatened by rising water.

**When to go:** May is genuinely good. The Adriatic is still cold for swimming but perfect for looking at.

**Local secret:** Get lost deliberately in Cannaregio, the northern neighborhood where locals actually live. Stop at a bacaro (standing-room wine bar) and drink something dry and unfamiliar while eating cicchetti (Venetian tapas). This is Venice without the Instagram angle.

# Tuscany & Umbria: Wildflowers and Medieval Hilltowns

If Italy has a spiritual heart separate from Rome, it lives in the rolling green hills of Tuscany and the slightly less-crowded, equally stunning hills of Umbria next door.

In central regions like Tuscany, you will find landscapes at their most lush and romantic, with gentle breezes flowing through open doors of countryside villas, revealing hillsides carpeted in vibrant green. In May, the wildflowers are at their peak‚Äîpoppies painting entire hillsides red, yellow mustard flowers covering abandoned fields, purple irises appearing at random intervals like someone thoughtlessly dropped jewels across the landscape.

Places like Alberobello, Monopoli, Bari, Ostuni, Polignano a Mare, Lecce, and Itria Valley are all great suggestions. May's weather makes it more bearable, and Puglia will also be slightly less crowded at this time of year. The region of Puglia‚Äîfar south, often overlooked‚Äîis underrated in ways that benefit you. White-washed villages, ancient trulli houses, and beaches that feel genuinely undiscovered.

But the real May magic in central Italy? The Infiorata festivals.

# The Infiorata: When Streets Become Art

Once a year in May (and some years extending into June around the Feast of Corpus Christi), certain Italian towns transform in a way that defies explanation to people who haven't seen it.

Infiorata means ""decorate with flowers,"" and the streets and squares of many Italian towns and cities are transformed into artistic carpets composed entirely of flower petals, created with extraordinary precision and creativity. The Infiorata of Noto in Sicily is scheduled from May 16-20, 2025, where a floral scene celebrating the theme ""Peace is made Art"" unfolds along the evocative Via Nicolaci.

This isn't simple flower arrangement. Artists spend nights carefully laying petals‚Äîthousands of them‚Äîto create intricate designs that range from religious imagery to mythology to abstract patterns. The work takes hours. By the next day, they're gone, swept away in a communal ceremony. The entire experience is breathtakingly, pointedly temporary.

Pietra Ligure in Liguria will host the Infiorata on May 24-25, 2025, where the streets of the village will be transformed into an open-air art gallery with some 50 floral works.

If you time your trip right, you can experience this. Plan accordingly. This alone is worth building a May itinerary around.

**Weather Overview:** May marks the beginning of Italy's warm season, with pleasantly mild temperatures across the country. Pack light layers‚Äîmornings and evenings can still be cool, but afternoons are genuinely warm. One sweater or light jacket. Comfortable walking shoes (you'll walk miles). Sunscreen.

**Money & Costs:** With the transition into the shoulder season, May offers an opportunity for budget-conscious travelers to experience Italy's charms without the hefty price tags associated with peak summer. Accommodation prices and airfares may be more reasonable. Expect mid-range accommodations at ‚Ç¨80-150 per night in smaller cities, ‚Ç¨150-250 in major ones. Restaurant meals ‚Ç¨12-18 outside tourist zones.

**Booking Strategy:** Book accommodations and transportation now. This is the critical moment‚Äîwhen prices are still reasonable but before summer pricing kicks in. It is essential to book your Italy hotels and transportation in advance, particularly if you plan to visit during festivals or special events.

**Train Travel:** Italy's train network is excellent. Buy a regional pass or book point-to-point tickets in advance. Traveling by train through the Italian countryside in May is one of those experiences that explains why people write novels about Italy.

# When to Book: The Strategic Window

Here's the truth about Italy travel: pricing follows seasons like the moon follows the earth. Right now (May planning period), you're in the optimal window. Not yet high season pricing, but all the best properties are available.

**First ideal booking moment:** For the Amalfi Coast and Tuscany, book accommodations NOW. These regions fill up fastest as people plan spring escapes. [Compare hotels across all price ranges and secure your dates here](https://expedia.com/affiliate/U51Zc8j)‚Äîyou'll see real availability and can lock in rates before they creep upward.

**Second ideal moment:** If you're planning a longer trip combining multiple regions, [search package deals that bundle flights and accommodations](https://expedia.com/affiliate/U51Zc8j)‚Äîsometimes booking together saves surprisingly more than you'd expect.

# The Things Nobody Tells You About May in Italy

The water is cold. Like, genuinely cold. Swimming exists mostly as a concept in May, not a practical activity. But it's also the reason the beaches aren't crowded‚Äîlocals know better.

School is still in session for Italian students, which means fewer Italian families crowding attractions, but also school groups doing field trips during weekday mornings. Visit attractions early or late.

Some smaller towns close early in shoulder season. Not everywhere, but enough that you should check hours.

The light in May is exceptional. If you're any kind of photographer‚Äîeven just taking phone pictures‚Äîyou've never had better light on Italian architecture.

# Final Thoughts

There's a famous (possibly apocryphal) quote often attributed to various people that goes something like: ""Travel is the only thing you buy that makes you richer."" Italy in May operates on this principle perfectly. You're not overpaying for heat and crowds. You're not underpaying for the experience by visiting in winter when the light is flat.

You're visiting at exactly the right moment‚Äîwhen everything is in bloom, when the weather cooperates, when you can still move through the cities without feeling like you're in a crowd-surfing situation.

So make your choice: Rome's quiet piazzas, Florence's blooming gardens, the Amalfi Coast's dramatic cliffs, Venice's uncrowded canals, or Tuscany's legendary hills. Or do what I've learned to do: string them together into a journey that feels less like tourism and more like slow travel.

**Ready to turn this spring dream into reality?** Don't let inspiration fade. [Search flights, hotels, and vacation packages here](https://expedia.com/affiliate/U51Zc8j) to lock in your May Italy escape while rates are still reasonable and the best properties have availability. Your Tuscan sunset, your Roman aperitivo, your Amalfi cliff walk‚Äîthey're all waiting.

Italy in May isn't just a trip. It's a conversation with beauty, whispered in the perfect weather, heard in quiet piazzas, tasted in seasonal food, and felt in gardens at their peak.

Go now. Before everyone else figures it out.

# Key Takeaways

* **Perfect weather:** 68-77¬∞F with mostly sunny skies‚Äîthe Goldilocks month of Italian travel
* **Manageable crowds:** Fewer tourists than summer, but more services open than spring
* **Budget-friendly pricing:** Mid-range hotels and flights still at shoulder-season rates before the rush
* **Festivals & flowers:** Infiorata celebrations transform streets into living art; gardens at their absolute peak
* **Book immediately:** Amalfi Coast and Tuscany fill up now; this is your window to lock in availability and rates

1o8b6qa,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapists/comments/1o8b6qa/seating_for_couples_therapy/,Seating for couples therapy,"Hi everyone,

I am a therapist and recently started seeing a couples therapist with my partner. I find the seating quite odd, she has us sit in separate chairs with a fairly large coffee table in between us, and so we are making a triangle with us facing her. The chairs aren‚Äôt even angled towards one another, so it makes it hard to see each other unless I physically change my position in the seat. And no, there are no couches available. She is Gottman trained and I‚Äôm not sure if that is connected? I don‚Äôt really like it and it makes me feel hard to be connected to my partner. Although we‚Äôve only had one session

I woke up gasping. The room‚Äôs black. Not dark, but black. Like there‚Äôs no depth. No light. Like I‚Äôm floating in a fucking void.

I‚Äôm 100% sure I left the bedside lamp on. After everything lately? I *know* I left it on. But right now, nothing. No shadows. No shapes. Only my phone screen glowing. At least I know I‚Äôm not blind.

An odd smell is coming from somewhere: rotten and burnt. Like meat left too long in a microwave. Or skin.

Tried using the flashlight on my phone. Just this weak glow barely showing the edge of my blanket. I feel like I‚Äôm not even in my room. Like I‚Äôm on a slab floating in pitch black.¬†

Typing to stay sane.Typing to stay grounded.

Wait. Something just moved.

I can hear a noise. A growl. It‚Äôs coming toward me.   
Pressure. On the other side of the bed. Like the mattress dipped. I can *feel* it there.

The smell is thicker now. I still can‚Äôt see. Why is my throat burning so much? Stomach too. It feels like someone‚Äôs peeling my skin off.

I want to scream, but my mouth is dry.

It said my name. What the fuck?   
It knows my name. I can hear it say my name.¬†

Not exactly a whisper. But more‚Ä¶flat. Like a broken recording.  
I feel like it can see me. Even though I can‚Äôt see shit.

Fuck, it‚Äôs too close now. My leg zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz



**7:48 a.m., Sept 13**

I think I blacked out.

Just woke up. My head is pounding.

There‚Äôs a sharp pain running down my right leg. Feels raw. Throbbing. The sheets are wet. I think I pissed myself.¬†

Pulled the blanket back, and there were three gashes. Deep. Like claws. Whatever it was, it grabbed me. I remember the pain and then, black.

I read what I wrote last night. Don‚Äôt remember all of it. Just flashes. The smell. The weight beside me. That voice.

Day four now. I‚Äôm losing my mind. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm hallucinating or if something is actually‚Ä¶ in here. With me.

I stopped going out two days ago. The last time I tried, on the subway back to my apartment, I saw blood drops leaking from the ceiling. Thick, red, slow. The whole compartment reeked. No one else noticed. The blood ran down the walls. I ran when the doors opened.

I haven‚Äôt set foot outside since. But am I even safe here anymore, in my own room?

NO NO NO, keep your mind calm, Jenna. Stay focused. Don‚Äôt let it fuck with you.¬†

I should sleep. I‚Äôm getting drowsy again. Just one last thing, I think, all these are somehow connected to that fucking tape.



**2:10 p.m., Sept 13**

Up for half an hour. Ate cereal. Took a hot shower..¬†

In the bathroom mirror, I noticed claw marks across my stomach. The ache from last night makes sense now. I called in sick again. I lied and said I had food poisoning, easier than explaining to anyone that something invisible grabbed me.

But I think I should tell someone. About this. For real.

Maybe Ruby. She might actually believe me.

Mom won‚Äôt. I can already hear the ‚Äúyou need sleep‚Äù speech.



**4:34 p.m., Sept 13**

I was going through that black tape again, and yes, I was right. Somehow, this tape is connected with my nightmares and hallucinations. The sound I heard last night was also there, in this tape.¬†

It‚Äôs from that weird collector lot I ordered off eBay. Supposed to be random DVDs and CDs. But this‚Ä¶ black cassette was inside. No label. No case.

I hooked up my old miniDV deck and fed the cassette in.

At first, there was just noise. Then the pictures came. Hard cuts. A book. A barren field. A flower drying. Grass. A wooden cross‚Äîgraveyard?‚Äî a group of people kneeling before something.¬†

The camera stopped cutting. A filthy room. A stone slab. A few people are standing around it. A girl lying naked across the stone, belly swollen. In the corner, an odd stone smeared with symbols.

Someone stepped into frame with a bowl, marking her belly.¬†

There was no dialogue. Then, A masked figure moved in front of her, blocking the camera. The girl‚Äôs legs kicked. When the figure shifted, a knife hung in their hand. Blood dripped. They had cut her. The bowl slid under the wound. Blood hit stone and spread slowly. I almost puked.

They didn‚Äôt dig deep. The masked one reached in with gloved fingers and took something I couldn‚Äôt see, held it up to the camera for one frame. Then they poured the blood over the marked stone.¬†

Here I heard the growl, the inhuman sound I heard last night

Then more random shots stitched together: faces with mouths stitched shut; chopped-off parts arranged in bowls; a room full of empty chairs; a doll; fire; so much fire; a building burning that looked like a church; a cross reversed against the smoke. Then all black.

So my initial thought was, this is an art project, probably an indie film. Found-footage cosplay. Like The Guinea Pig series or Blair Witch.¬†

But maybe I am wrong.

I messaged the seller about the black tape. He replied in five minutes: ‚ÄúI only listed DVDs/CDs. No cassette. Must‚Äôve been packed by the store.‚Äù He sent a stamp from a pawn shop two towns over and said he‚Äôd ‚Äúcheck with them.‚Äù



**7:32 p.m., Sept 13**¬†

Spent the evening triple-checking locks. Ordered my dinner and microwaved it.¬†

I‚Äôm not sleeping tonight. I know that now.

That fog, the drowsiness from last night‚Äîit‚Äôs crawling back. I can feel it in my head. Like, my thoughts are getting slower. Heavier.

I‚Äôll drink coffee. Or tea. Just need to stay awake. And tomorrow, first thing‚ÄîI‚Äôm calling Ruby. I‚Äôll tell her everything. I don‚Äôt think anyone else would believe me anyway.



**9:17 p.m., Sept 13**

I don‚Äôt remember the last hour.

I think I somehow fell asleep on the couch again.¬†

The miniDV is in. That tape is playing on the TV. No idea when I set it up. Don‚Äôt remember turning anything on. And I can‚Äôt imagine why I‚Äôd want to watch it again.

I checked my phone. Still no reply from the eBay seller. His last message was about the pawn shop, and then nothing. Maybe he doesn‚Äôt know much about the tape either.

Or maybe he does and just won‚Äôt talk about it.

I think I should get rid of the cassette.¬†



**10:32 p.m., Sept 13**

I‚Äôm thinking of burning it.

I packed all the DVDs with that black tape. I don‚Äôt know what else to do, and I‚Äôm sure this is all because of that tape.

I am gonna try to burn these cassettes. I don‚Äôt care what it is. I don‚Äôt care what happens. This thing‚Äôs not staying here.

I‚Äôm going to text Ruby to come over. I don‚Äôt want to tell her everything right now, just ‚ÄúCan you come down?‚Äù Kinda text. Dont wanna sound all nuts, or freak her out, but I need someone here. *I need her.*



**11:57 a.m. Sept 13**

My right hand is blistered and raw. I didn‚Äôt even realize I was screaming until my throat went dry. The whole apartment smells like something cooked or burnt meat.¬†

There‚Äôs black liquid leaking from my hand. Not blood. It‚Äôs thicker, darker, like oil. It smells sweet, almost syrupy, and I don‚Äôt know if that makes it worse.

The stove‚Äôs still on. The tape I am holding is half-melted, dripping plastic. The counter‚Äôs splattered with soot. I think I was burning the tape‚Ä¶ but I can‚Äôt remember when I started, or why I stopped. I don‚Äôt remember *anything* after lighting the match.

The kitchen‚Äôs quiet now‚Äîtoo quiet‚Äîbut the floor‚Äôs a mess. There are wet footprints in front of me. Small. Bare. Shaped like a person‚Äôs, but the steps don‚Äôt stop at the tiles.

They go up. Up the wall. And then across the ceiling, perfectly spaced, like someone walking upside down.¬†

I followed them. Of course I did. I don‚Äôt even know why. They led me out of the kitchen, down the hallway, straight into my room. Right to my bed. And then‚Äînothing. The last print stops there, like whatever was walking just *waited*.

There‚Äôs a sound outside now‚Äîthe building‚Äôs fire alarm. I opened my door just enough to peek out, but the hallway It‚Äôs full of fog.¬†

I called Ruby. My hands were shaking so bad I could barely type. She picked up. She said she‚Äôs coming. God, I hope she‚Äôs fast.



**12:44 a.m. Sept 14**

I don‚Äôt remember lying down, but I‚Äôm naked now. The blanket‚Äôs on the floor, the lamp‚Äôs still flickering, and everything around me hums.

My stomach looks wrong. It‚Äôs swollen‚Äîtight, like it‚Äôs been filled with something. When I touch it, I can feel warmth under the skin. Movement.

There‚Äôs a mark there. Carved into me. Not deep enough to bleed, but it stings on touch. It‚Äôs the same one that was drawn on that girl‚Äôs stomach in the tape, right before they cut her open.

Am I going to die?

The black ooze from my hand is drying now, turning crusty, but the smell‚Äôs stronger. Sweet. Metallic. Like fruit and rust.

I heard something in the living room. I stood up, somehow, and walked over.

The tape‚Äôs in the player again. The one I *burned*. Half of it‚Äôs melted, edges curled, but it‚Äôs still spinning.

I can hear footsteps behind me now. Slow.  
I can *feel* almost it.  
I know if I turn around, I‚Äôll see it.  
See *him*.

I think I should lie down again. Just for a second. Maybe if I rest, he‚Äôll stop watching. He‚Äôs not angry anymore. I can feel that. He‚Äôs calm. Gentle. He loves me.

He just wants me to listen.

There‚Äôs music in the tape. A low rhythm under the static. It‚Äôs Comforting. I‚Äôve been humming it without realizing.

My hand doesn‚Äôt hurt now. The black is gone. My skin looks new.

I think I know what he wants.  
A gift. Something that proves I trust him.

I have a knife in my hand.

He‚Äôs saying it‚Äôs okay. I should finish what *they* started, and the song, it is louder now, so beautiful I can‚Äôt breathe. I want to be part of it. I want to join him.

I should stop fighting it.

A friend is currently on a trip to japan, and will bring a jar of Colombia Risaralda Milan ""Logan"" from glitch coffee. Problem is: it comes in a 100g Jar. Now I am a bit worried if and how I can dial in that shot in the most efficient way to get the greatest amount of good shots from that, as I dont want to waste the beans.

I am running a timemore 078s and a Cafelat Robot, and use WDT, other than that I just use a normal tamper and a temperature controlled kettle. I also have access to a Commandante C40 with RedClix.

My plan would be to grind the first shot on the coarser side, and run a relatively 'normal"" espresso ratio and go from there. i guess, as the coffee is quite lightly roasted, a longer ratio might benefit it.

What temp would you recommend me (maybe a question especially towards the robot users), and is my plan sound? Would you use the C40 or the 078s?

Thanks!

1o8b27l,https://www.reddit.com/r/PackAndGo/comments/1o8b27l/best_place_to_visit_in_italy_in_april/,Best Place To Visit In Italy In April,"There's a moment in April when Italy wakes up‚Äîwhen the city streets smell like wisteria and fresh espresso, when wildflowers reclaim the Tuscan hillsides, and when you can actually *breathe* in front of the Colosseum without being crushed by a thousand other tourists.

I learned this by accident. I'd planned a Rome trip for July once and canceled. When I rebooked for April, everything changed. The same cobblestone streets I'd walked through in summer‚Äîsuffocating under crowds and 95-degree heat‚Äîsuddenly felt intimate. I found myself alone in galleries where I'd expected queues. I sat in piazzas sipping wine while locals passed by instead of selfie-stick-wielding tour groups.

April isn't the flashy choice. It's not summer's golden marketing poster. But it might be the best month in Italy‚Äîif you know where to look.

# Why April Feels Like Italy's Best-Kept Secret

Spring in Italy arrives gently, then suddenly explodes. By April, the country has shaken off winter's gray melancholy, but summer's crushing crowds haven't arrived. Temperatures in Rome hover around a comfortable 67¬∞F during the day (highs) and 48¬∞F in the evenings, meaning you'll layer your jacket but rarely need it for more than morning walks.

More importantly: prices haven't skyrocketed yet. April is shoulder season, which means better deals on hotels, flights, and certain activities compared to peak season. You're getting summer-like accessibility with winter-like costs‚Äîa rare sweet spot that savvy travelers guard like secrets.

But here's the catch: Easter often falls in April, and if you're in Rome, Venice, or Florence over that weekend, you'll encounter the entire country's vacation simultaneously. In 2025, Easter Sunday is April 20th and Easter Monday is April 21st. The key is strategic timing.

# Rome: Ancient Glory Without the Gridlock

Rome demands your first three days minimum, and April offers something precious: you can actually see the city.

The Colosseum and Roman Forum‚Äîmonuments that reduce 50,000 people to shuffling shadows in August‚Äîfeel almost contemplative when you visit before Easter. I watched morning light transform the Forum's ancient stone columns gold, with maybe 30 other people around me. I wasn't fighting for space at the Trevi Fountain. I wasn't leaving the Vatican feeling like I'd just survived a mosh pit.

The magic is the same. The history hasn't gone anywhere. But in April, you experience it rather than endure it.

Spend your first day losing yourself in the ancient sites: Colosseum, Pantheon, Roman Forum, and Trevi Fountain. The second day, wander the neighborhoods where Romans actually live. Trastevere at sunrise, when delivery scooters outnumber tourists. Testaccio's food markets where vendors still bark prices in Italian, not English. Campo de'Fiori for coffee and people-watching‚Äîthis is everyday Roman life, and it's worth more than any tour.

Day three: the Vatican. April is a great time to visit St. Peter's Basilica without the peak summer crowds. The museums remain magnificent and overwhelming, but at least you can actually move through the corridors.

**Where to Stay:** Stay in the historic center if budget allows‚ÄîCampo de'Fiori, Via Nazionale, or the Spanish Steps area put you within walking distance of everything. Budget options: ‚Ç¨60-90/night. Mid-range: ‚Ç¨120-200/night. Luxury: ‚Ç¨300+/night. April rates are roughly 40% lower than summer, making even mid-range hotels feel generous.

# Florence: Cherry Blossoms and Renaissance Secrets

Florence in April is a photographer's fever dream. The Duomo's red-tiled dome rises against pale spring skies. Wisteria cascades over medieval walls in shades of purple and lavender. The Uffizi Gallery and Accademia remain must-sees, but you'll want to book tickets in advance‚Äîeven in shoulder season, these attractions cap entries to preserve the experience.

Here's what most tourists miss: skip the city on weekends (it's when Italian families escape for short trips) and visit midweek. Tuesday through Thursday, the galleries transform. You'll see masterpieces instead of the back of someone's head.

Go to the Boboli Gardens at 8am before the crowds arrive. Sit on stone terraces overlooking the Arno. Eat a pastry bought from a corner bakery (not a tourist caf√©). This is the Florence you came for.

If you're there on Easter Sunday (April 20th), witness the *Scoppio del Carro*‚Äîthe Explosion of the Cart. A massive firework-laden cart is set alight in front of the Duomo in an explosive display that's more chaotic and magical than any orchestrated festival.

**Getting There:** Take the train from Rome (2.5 hours, ‚Ç¨15-40 economy). Buses are cheaper but slower.

# Venice: The Floating City Takes a Breath

Venice is perpetually crowded, but April offers a whisper of peace before the shouting starts. Gondolas still glide through canals. St. Mark's Square still overwhelms. But you can actually move through the bridges without being swept along by a human current.

Arrive early (before 9am) at major attractions or skip them entirely for hidden experiences. Wander the residential islands‚ÄîBurano's neon-painted houses, Murano's glass workshops, Torcello's Byzantine cathedral where locals still outnumber tourists. Take a vaporetto (water bus) across the lagoon and discover why Venetians love their city beyond the guidebook spots.

April 25th is St. Mark's Day in Venice, marked with a boat race and celebrations in Saint Mark's Square‚Äîan authentic local event if you can navigate the crowds.

**Where to Stay:** Venice accommodations are expensive year-round, but April offers better rates than summer. Stay on the mainland in Mestre or Marghera and take the fast train to central Venice (30 minutes, ‚Ç¨2-3)‚Äîthis is how locals travel and it saves ‚Ç¨50+ per night.

# The Off-Track Alternatives: Where April Really Shines

Rome, Florence, Venice‚Äîthey're essential Italy. But April reveals something most guidebooks miss: the secondary cities where spring transforms everything.

**Puglia (The Heel of Italy's Boot)** Rolling white-washed farmhouses, Adriatic coastlines, and food that will make you question why you ever ate pasta anywhere else. Puglia offers the same rolling hills and charming hill towns as Tuscany but without the hype and crowds. Bari and Lecce are architectural masterpieces where you'll see three Italian tourists instead of 3,000. In April, the weather is warm enough for beach walks but not scorching. Prices are 30-40% lower than comparable Tuscan destinations.

**Orvieto** This stunning clifftop town in Umbria features one of Italy's most beautiful cathedrals and offers fewer crowds than Florence. The town perches on volcanic rock overlooking rolling vineyards. Stay two nights, eat at family-run trattorias where the owner knows your name by dinner two, and understand why this is where Italians vacation when they want to feel like locals.

**Cinque Terre (Late April)** Wait until after April 15th when trails are reliably dry and weather is stable. Hiking the legendary Path of the Gods, with Mediterranean cliffs dropping to turquoise water below, feels dreamlike in spring. The crowds haven't arrived. The restaurants still seat you without reservations.

# Why Book Now (April Prices are Disappearing)

Here's the ruthless truth about 2025: 2025 is the Catholic Holy Year of Jubilee, and record numbers of pilgrims are expected in Rome, especially over Easter. This means hotel prices have already crept upward from typical April rates.

If you're going, book accommodations within the next 2-3 weeks while last-minute deals still exist. Book museums and attractions at least 2 weeks ahead. Secure your flights now‚ÄîApril flights are filling up faster than usual.

For the best hotel rates, book about a month in advance, ideally on a Tuesday. Expedia's package deals (flight + hotel bundles) can save 15-25% compared to booking separately, and for April travel, every euro counts.

# What to Pack: Layers are Everything

Mornings are chilly enough for a light jacket. Afternoons warm to t-shirt weather. Evenings drop back to jacket-weather again. Rain is possible but not guaranteed‚Äîbring a waterproof layer and comfortable walking shoes with grip (cobblestones get slippery when wet).

Pack layers over heavy coats. A lightweight scarf doubles as fashion and practicality. Comfortable walking shoes are non-negotiable. One nice outfit for dinner out. Sunglasses for the increasingly intense Mediterranean sun. An umbrella‚ÄîApril showers are brief but intense.

1o8b0ex,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_MirkWorks/comments/1o8b0ex/excerpt_from_marx_and_engels_on_bonapartism/,"Excerpt from Marx and Engels on Bonapartism: Selected Journalism, 1851‚Äì59 edited by Spencer Leonard (Introduction 1848 and the Consolidation of Marx and Engels' Marxism III)","**Introduction**

***1848 and the Consolidation of Marx and Engels‚Äô Marxism***

...

Marx began his political life as a journalist and was jealously defensive of the honor of his profession. His first publications in the *Rheinische Zeitung* in 1842 opposed Prussian press censorship, as did the last thing he wrote for the *Neue Rheinische Zeitung* in 1849. When during the revolution he was put on trial for editing that organ, Marx concluded his courtroom defense (which won him both the jury‚Äôs applause and acquittal) by proclaiming ‚Äúthe first duty of the press‚Äù to be ‚Äúto undermine all the foundations of the existing political state of affairs.‚Äù **And press freedom was central to Marx and Engels‚Äôs conception of politics. Fifteen years later, towards the end of the US Civil War and just after the founding of the International Working Man‚Äôs Association, Engels stated simply, ‚Äúunless there is freedom of the press, the right of association, and the right of assembly, no workers‚Äô movement is possible.‚Äù** He reiterated the same point in 1871 in an address to the International Workingman‚Äôs Association: **‚ÄúThe political freedoms‚Äîthe right of assembly and association, and the freedom of the press‚Äîthose are our weapons.‚Äù Opposing the Lassalleans‚Äô idolization of universal suffrage democracy at the expense of civil liberty, Marx and Engels railed against the view that socialist politics might safely neglect ‚Äúsuch ‚Äòsubordinate‚Äô things as freedom of the press and the right of association and assembly, which,‚Äù they did not fail to observe, ‚Äúeven the bourgeoisie stood for.‚Äù**

Liberalism as an ideology both constituted and arose from bourgeois social relations. As Engels put it in 1865,

* **The bourgeoisie and the proletariat are both progeny of a new era. . . both are striving to eliminate the remnants of the bric-a-brac left over from earlier times. It is true that there is a most serious conflict to be settled between them, but this conflict can only be fought out when they are facing each other alone. Only by jettisoning the old lumber can the ‚Äúdecks be cleared for battle‚Äù‚Äîexcept that this time the battle will be fought not between two ships but on board the one ship, between officers and crew. . . . As distinct from the old estates, distinguished by birth, the bourgeoisie must proclaim human rights; as distinct from the guilds, the bourgeoisie must proclaim freedom of trade and industry; as distinct from the tutelage of the bureaucracy, the bourgeoisie must proclaim freedom and self-government. To be consistent, it must therefore demand universal, direct suffrage, freedom of the press, association, and assembly, and the suspension of all special laws directed against individual classes of the population.**

**Concluding that ‚Äúthere is nothing else that the proletariat needs to demand from \[the existing political order\],‚Äù it would be idle, Engels maintains, to demand that ‚Äúthe bourgeoisie should cease to be a bourgeoisie,‚Äù but ‚Äú\[the proletariat\] certainly can require that \[bourgeois society\] practices its own principles consistently.‚Äù** Historically, this strategy built the socialist workers‚Äô movement. The working class ‚Äú\[furthered\] their own development and organization precisely through and with this movement, whose immediate aims were purely bourgeois in nature, more than by any other method.‚Äù **The political movement for socialism develops within civil society and demands the freedom that requires. The exercise of civil liberties is what Marxism meant by socialist politics per se. Systematizing Marxism at the end of the nineteenth century, Karl Kautsky reinforced this Marxian legacy saying, ‚ÄúEvery class struggle is a political struggle. . . On this account, wherever the working class has \[organized itself\]. . . it has made political demands, especially demands for a free press and the right of assemblage. . . Whoever attempts to deny \[these rights\]. . . is to be reckoned among the worst enemies of the working class.‚Äù As Lenin would later put it, the ‚Äúidentity of the most pressing need of the proletariat. . . with the need of the general democratic movement‚Äù had to be expressed as ‚Äúa comprehensive political education through the medium of political agitation and political exposures.‚Äù**

From the Grub Street pamphlet mills to *Areopagitica* (1644), John Milton‚Äôs classic defense of free speech during the English Civil War, to Thomas Paine‚Äôs *American Crisis* (1776‚Äì83) and Jean-Paul Marat‚Äôs *L‚ÄôAmi du Peuple* (1789‚Äì92) in the high bourgeois revolutions, journalism was the lifeblood of revolution. **Necessarily, then, it got embroiled in the crisis of the revolution under conditions of capital. The public sphere itself‚Äîthe very exercise of public reason‚Äîwas entangled in the self-contradiction into which bourgeois society had fallen. As J√ºrgen Habermas argued more than half a century ago, the emergence of socialism and the Revolution of 1848 proved a crisis of the public sphere. Reattaining Marx‚Äôs recognition of a century before‚Äî that socialist politics required that ‚Äú\[the workers and capitalists‚Äô\] economic conflict \[be translated\] into the only form holding any promise of success. . . into political conflict‚Äù‚ÄîHabermas understood that socialism required that ‚Äúthe masses. . . employ the platform of the public sphere. . . not to destroy it, but to make it into what. . . \[it\] always claimed to be.‚Äù** This Marx and Engels had attempted to do during the Revolution of 1848 in the pages of the *Neue Rheinische Zeitung*. Yet, as they soon discovered, the potential ‚Äúoccupation of the political public sphere by \[socialism\]‚Äù undermined it. Addressing society‚Äôs needs might occasion a threat to public safety. With the revolution‚Äôs failure (and helping to precipitate it) there developed ‚Äúan interlocking of state and society which removed from the public sphere its former basis without supplying a new one.‚Äù

**In the new era of mass democracy, ‚Äúthe integration of the public and private realms entailed a corresponding disintegration of the public sphere that once was the go-between linking state and society.‚Äù This was no mere matter of censorship or manipulation by particular interests, much less of the outright muzzling of the press (though there was no shortage of that, as, most obviously, in Second Empire France). In place of public reason expressed through newspapers, pamphlets, and other publications, there emerged modern mass media, a change masked by the persistence, under conditions of capital, of newspapers, pamphlets, and other publications.** Habermas put it this way:

* \[The\] mediating function passed from the public to such institutions as have arisen out of the private sphere (e.g., special-interest associations) or out of the public sphere, e.g., parties; these now engage in the exercise and equilibration of power in cooperating with the state apparatus, treating it as a matter internal to their own organizations. At the same time, they endeavor via mass media that themselves have become autonomous to obtain the agreement, or at least acquiescence, of a mediatized public. . .

**Liberals had argued, ‚Äúpublicity guaranteed the connection between rational-critical public debate and the legislative foundation of domination, including the critical supervision of its exercise,‚Äù but the society liberals helped create was transformed by its very realization, as its freedom grew self-contradictory. Capitalist democracy issued from this contradiction. Managing it ‚Äú\[made\] possible the peculiar ambivalence of a domination exercised through the domination of nonpublic opinion.‚Äù** As Marx colorfully put it in the *Eighteenth Brumaire*, ‚ÄúThe bourgeoisie have never wearied of crying out to the revolution what Saint Arsenius cried to the Christians: ‚ÄòFuge, tace, quiesce!‚Äô Flee, be silent, keep still! Bonaparte cries to the bourgeoisie \[the same thing\].‚Äù **This silence might take the form of an explosion of mass media. In any case, the struggle for socialism can no more dispense with journalism than can any other politics.** As Lenin wrote, ‚ÄúNewspapers, pamphlets, and leaflets perform the indispensable work of propaganda, agitation, and organization. No mass movement in any country at all civilized can get along without a journalistic apparatus.‚Äù

The issue that Habermas, Marx, and Lenin address is not simply that journalists come to uphold the interests of the wealthy and powerful (and that this needs to be countered by a workers‚Äô press). Nor is it simply the consolidation of ownership that is at issue. **For the professional journalist herself, the issue is ultimately one of what of Luk√°cs terms ‚Äúreification‚Äù whereby ‚Äúsubjectivity itself, knowledge, temperament, and powers of expression. . . are reduced to an abstract mechanism functioning autonomously and divorced both from the personality of the ‚Äòowner‚Äô and from the material and concrete nature of the subject matter in hand.‚Äù For Luk√°cs, the professional journalist‚Äôs ‚Äú‚Äòlack of convictions,‚Äô the prostitution of \[her\] experiences and beliefs‚Äù represent ‚Äúthe apogee of capitalist reification.‚Äù** Walter Benjamin makes the same point from the other end:

* \[After 1848\] it is a matter of chance whether an individual forms an image of himself. . . Man‚Äôs inner concerns do not have their issueless private character by nature. They do so only when he is increasingly unable to assimilate the data of the world around by way of experience. Newspapers constitute one of many evidences of such an inability. If it were the intention of the press to have the reader assimilate the information it supplies as part of his own experience, it would not achieve its purpose. But its intention is just the opposite, and it is achieved: to isolate what happens from the real in which it could affect the experience of the reader.

This no mere matter of journalists ‚Äúselling out,‚Äù much less of public apathy, but of the obscuring of the totality precisely through the illumination of particulars. Fake news need not be fake, as, in the age of capital, journalists grow simultaneously jaded and sentimental. Benjamin‚Äôs friend and Habermas‚Äôs teacher, Theodor W. Adorno, explains,

* Societal consciousness tacitly renounces a distinction between truth and opinion, a renunciation that does not leave the movement of spirit unaffected. . . \[T\]ruth becomes opinion to the consciousness that is wise to the world, as with the journalist. But opinion replaces truth with itself. In place of the both problematical and binding idea of truth in itself there appears the more comfortable idea of truth for us, whether it be for everyone, or at least for many.

Periodical publication, that most emblematic practice of the Enlightenment, thus became, even as it remained what it was before, a means of coordinating reason with the status quo.

The proletariat read newspapers, and the new journalism, like them, was the product of industrialization. Indeed, the very masthead of the *New York Tribune* bore an image of workers serving a new steam-powered printing press. For Marx, this‚Äîagain, like proletarianization itself‚Äîwas not simply to be affirmed as progress. In a letter to Kugelmann, he remarked,

* Up to now it was believed that the development of the Christian myths under the Roman Empire had been possible only because printing had not yet been invented. Just the contrary. The daily press and the telegraph, which in a trice spread their disclosures over the whole earth, fabricate more myths (which the bourgeois cattle believe and disseminate) in one day than could formerly have been turned out in a century.

**Mass literacy, no less than social atomization, was a precondition of mass democracy.** It is therefore unsurprising that Marx grappled less with the conservative than with the Palmerstonian press, above all the *Times*, which he dubbed Lord Palmerston‚Äôs ‚Äú*Moniteur*‚Äù (the official paper of Second Empire France). To Marx, Prime Minister Palmerston, like Louis Bonaparte, represented less a class interest than the interest of imperialism itself. Like Palmerston, the *Times* and papers like it represented to their readers not only a ruling-class but a capitalist interest, not only a British but a world-state interest. No less than‚Äîarguably, more than‚ÄîLouis Bonaparte, Palmerston stood for the permanency (of the crisis) of executive power on a world scale. Under conditions of capital, bourgeois society at the moment of its realization fell into crisis, into self-contradiction, as a result of which the state possessed ‚Äúa peculiar morality of its own, a kind of superior law of *raison d‚Äô√©tat*.‚Äù The Palmerstonian press normalized this permanent state of exception.

In 1864, Marx‚Äôs contemporary and a fierce critique of Louis Bonaparte, Maurice Joly, wrote as follows of the imperialist press as if in the voice of the emperor:

* I now must make clear how I will use \[the press\] to augment my power. I dare say that to this day no government has conceived of anything as bold as what I am about to describe. Since it is almost always because of the press that governments in parliamentary countries are brought down, my scheme envisions neutralizing the press by the press itself. Because journalism wields such great power, do you know what my government will do? It will become like them. It will be journalism incarnate. . . I shall divide the newspapers devoted to my cause into three or four categories. In the first group, I will put a certain number of newspapers that will adopt the official line of things in a straightforward way. They will defend my acts unreservedly. . . \[But\] my power will be found \[chiefly where\]. . . the official or quasi-official slant on things is totally absent, but \[absent\] only on the surface, of course. Even these newspapers will be tied to my government, visibly, in some instances, and invisibly, in others. . . I expect a loyal organ in every camp, in every party. I shall have an aristocratic organ in the party of aristocrats, a republican organ in the republican party, a revolutionary organ in the party of revolution, an anarchistic organ, if need be, in the party of anarchists. Like the god Vishnu, my press will have a hundred arms, and these arms will stretch out their hands throughout the country delicately giving form to all manner of opinion. Everyone will belong to my party without knowing it.

When Marx worked as a professional journalist, this tendency that Joly describes was by no means confined to France. **Marx‚Äôs ‚Äústyle‚Äù‚Äîhis scathing and ironic tone, for instance‚Äîexpressed not cynicism but critical (because self-conscious) reification. Yet, what first strikes the reader of Marx‚Äôs journalism is how fully it conforms to type. Marx practiced no sort of alternative journalism; he reported on what every journalist must, the events of the day. At the same time, he was keenly attuned to how events are covered, so that his journalism constituted a kind of running critique. We do not know whether or to what extent Marx studied the papers in coffee shops and libraries, or whether he purchased newspapers and read them chiefly at home. We have only anecdotal evidence, as when he complained in a letter to Engels that his poverty was so extreme that ‚ÄúI \[do not\] have a penny to go \[to a local coffee house\] and read the papers.‚Äù** The articles he wrote digested events, even as they interrogated the public debate that framed them.

Just as Marx‚Äôs critique of political economy required him to be a political economist (and his critique of philosophy required him to be a philosopher and his critique of socialism required him to be a socialist), so too with journalism. Marx marshals his facts and tallies the press‚Äôs misrepresentations, even as he provokes a recognition of objectivity‚Äôs crisis. While developing no elaborate argument in the manner of Habermas respecting the changed role of the press, Marx‚Äôs journalistic practice nevertheless sought to provoke critical consciousness of the crisis of public reason even as it insisted upon meeting the old necessity under altered conditions.

Nice candles that aren't too perfumey or assume anything about their taste, interesting desk accessories that work for any style, quality kitchen tools that literally everyone uses regardless of their cooking habits.

The goal is hitting that very specific sweet spot of ""this person clearly has good taste and put some thought into this"" without crossing into ""they've been carefully studying my life and this is starting to feel concerning."" It's honestly an art form that I haven't quite mastered yet.

Ten years ago my father and step mom were in a horrible motorcycle accident that ended up taking both of their lives. That week I started a song called ""drinking with a ghost"" in ten years I never worked on it until this week. With help from my siblings with direct quotes from them, this is what I came up with. While I no longer drink, as follows is the completed poem and sing* ""drinking with a ghost. 



I pulled up a stool in a bar made of memory,
October winds blowing heavy through me.
Ten years gone, but the glass in my hand,
Still waits for the fire of a hardworking man.

You‚Äôd say, 
‚ÄúTake your shoes off, stay awhile,‚Äù
Coffee in your hand, with that sideways smile.
Teaching stick shift, you laughed with my brother,
‚ÄúBetter not spill a drop,‚Äù one way or another.

I‚Äôm drinking with a ghost tonight,
In the glow of a neon, fading light.
Telling you how I quit, how that woman let me go,
How your lessons still save me more than you know.
The world keeps on turning, but it turns me slow,
When I‚Äôm drinking with a ghost.

You said, ‚ÄúIt ain‚Äôt what I paid, it‚Äôs what they‚Äôll pay from me,‚Äù
Ran a small-town lot with grit and honesty.
You dreamed of a firetruck, to live to a hundred years,
Now I carry your weight, through my doubts and my fears.

Momma‚Äôs voice echoes, sharp and plain,
‚ÄúPig in the mud, could mess up a wet dream in the rain.‚Äù
But she loved us hard, and she fought her fight,
She still rides the wind on a Pensacola night.

I‚Äôm drinking with a ghost tonight,
In the glow of a neon, fading light.
Telling you I‚Äôve traveled, still restless, still proud,
Never stay quiet, always too loud.
The world keeps on turning, but it turns me slow,
When I‚Äôm drinking with a ghost.

I‚Äôd tell you I quit the bottle, though it makes me ache,
That I‚Äôve broken some hearts, and I‚Äôve made my mistakes.
You‚Äôd shake your head, say I‚Äôm stubborn and wild,
But you‚Äôd still call me your blood, still call me your child.

So here‚Äôs to the firetruck that never grew old,
To the woman beside you with a heart made of gold.
To the boys who remember, to the lessons you gave,
To the barstool I visit, to the ones I still crave.

I‚Äôm drinking with a ghost tonight,
In a bar where the memories hold me tight.
If the good Lord‚Äôs listening, I hope He knows,
I‚Äôm still drinking with a ghost.

---

Drinking with a ghost,
in a bar I built from memory.
October sits heavy in my chest,
ten years of silence between us.

You‚Äôre still teaching stick shift,
coffee in hand,
saying you‚Äôd better not spill a drop.
Still telling strangers
to take their shoes off and stay awhile.
Still running that lot,
shaking your head with a grin,
""It ain‚Äôt what I paid for it,
it‚Äôs what they‚Äôll pay for it.""

And she‚Äôs still there too.
Her voice sharp and true:
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre like a pig in the mud,
you‚Äôd find a way to mess up a wet dream.‚Äù
But her love was bigger than the roads we lost her on,
and she rides with you,
in that Pensacola night.

I tell you what you missed.
That I quit drinking,
and though it cost me love,
it saved my life.
That I‚Äôve traveled,
restless and proud,
carrying the survival lessons you carved into me.
I think you‚Äôd be proud.
I think you‚Äôd call me foolish.
I think you‚Äôd be right on both counts.

When I was a boy you told me
you wanted to be a firetruck,
to live to a hundred.
Now I‚Äôm the one who burns,
the one who tries to last.

The bar fades,
but the glass is still in my hand.
And the ghost is still here,
grinning,
shaking his head,
reminding me
that love doesn‚Äôt leave,
it just changes seats.

1o8avsf,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1o8avsf/i_saw_my_shadow_blink/,I Saw My Shadow Blink,"You know that weird feeling when you just know you're missing something but you swear you grabbed everything on your way out the door? Sure some may claim anxiety or just general forgetfulness, but I would have sworn on my life that something was missing as my engine finally sparked and I slowly inched my way out of my driveway. And before you say anything, I had been planning on getting the spark plugs replaced for over a month, but every time I thought about it, they started working just enough again to give me confidence in pushing it back a couple more days. Sure I stalled out here and there, but the money I saved by ignoring the issue was worth every annoyance it brought. Soon enough, the sputtering of my engine filled my ears, breaking the seal on the the deafening silence I had been subjected to thus far. 

Normally my 45 minute daily drive would be accompanied by music, or occasionally a spooky stories podcast when new episodes dropped, but this morning I couldn't bring myself to drown out my thoughts with the bickering of two friends with microphones. That feeling... that... emptiness. It made me feel uneasy. I went over the things I needed for work in my head at least 100 times on my way in. Phone, wallet, keys, work keys, name tag, laptop, files, and readers. Everything was accounted for, all in the spots I had left them the night before. And now all thrown in the passenger's seat next to me. As I exited my neighborhood, I saw what looked like the aftermath of a poor guy getting kicked out of the house. A pair of shoes, shorts, and a tank lay on the ground, followed by another pair of shorts and some running shoes further up. As I approached the site of the chaos, a complete mess of clothes, shoes, and even a couple bikes seemed to be strewn about haphazardly, getting more dense as they approached the car door. Wife must have caught him cheating or something and left his crap by his car in a wordless way of saying ""Get Out."" Living alone had its drawbacks sure, but knowing that my stuff wasn't going to leave their final resting places until I came around to move them was definitely a bonus. 

My 45 minute drive took only 30, the lack of traffic being a welcome start to what I expected to be a gruelling Monday back in the office. Why drive an hour and a half every day to go to a job I don't like you may ask? Well, as mentioned previously, the whole ""ignoring my issues because they cost too much to fix"" tended to be a driving factor. Approaching the back entrance, I noticed some clothes that look like they were left by a bum or something. We had a homeless issue, especially in the city near the office. They don't usually cause much trouble but it could be annoying when they haphazardly left their stuff in their last sleeping spot after leaving the next morning. Looking closer, they seemed to be a bit nicer than what I was used to seeing left behind in an alley. Eh, I shrugged, if they want to pitch their donations, it isn't my place to judge. I just wish they'd leave their crap somewhere else. Preferably somewhere that wasn't a place of business.

Looking down in front of the door I saw one of our company key cards. I read it to myself, Pat Dorrow, and wasn't surprised. Pat had a tendency to be a bit of a clutz, but I figured I'd be a good Samaritan and give it back to him without causing a scene. As I cracked open the back door to ""Tina's Terrific Taxes and Loans"" I was surprised to see I was the first one in. While I had gotten there 15 minutes earlier than expected, usually Tina herself was there well before anyone else. As I poked my head around a corner to see into her office, I could see a jacket draped over her big boss lady chair, her laptop open on her desk, the screen flashing something red, and a paper coffee cup, the lid stained with her signature coral pink lipstick. Obviously she had been in this morning, or maybe she'd even spent the night. As I peered in and saw the army of empty coffee cups that accompanied the first, I began to assume the latter. She must have stepped away for a minute, but it was odd that her melodic voice couldn't be heard echoing down the hallway or muffled behind the break room door. 

Siezing the opportunity to relax for a few minutes before having to shoo away angry clients, I plopped down at my desk and hooked up my laptop into the dock carefully shoved in the back corner. The click of the plug seemed to echo in my skull, the lack of sound again becoming evident. I stopped for a moment, perfectly still, and listened. Not a single bird could be heard outside. The lights were off so the electric humming of the florescents was also absent. Even the low humming of the boiler, which could only ever be heard on days where we were truly empty, seemed to be dead. It was like someone disconnected the world, all power and life being flipped off. 

I could feel the beating of my heart grow heavier, the intense pumping of blood seeming to pulse against my head and wrists as my thoughts grew more dire. Where is everyone? Were there any other cars on the road this morning? When was the last time I got a push notification on my phone? At the last thought, I looked down. No new notifications, not even the automatic ones. Things were starting to get very uncomfortable. I could feel the stillness of the air around me, the warmth making my button down shirt stick to my skin, and making me itch like crazy.

Crazy. I had to be right? I must have gone crazy or something, that's why there's nothing here. It must be a dream or some psychotic break or something. That's the only thing that makes sense. I pinched my arm, the pain immediate and piercing. Just as quickly as it had happened, it dulled back to the same nothingness that suffocated me. Okay, so maybe not dreaming. But this can't be happening. I looked at the desk behind mine and saw my next plan: a letter opener. This would definitely knock me out of this hallucination or dream or whatever the hell it was. Hesitantly, I held it against the palm of my hand, and pulled down as quickly as I could. The pain, that was definitely real. Blood pooled and dripped against the lacquered wood, the deep red a stark contrast to the pearlescent paint meant to invoke the luxury look of marble. The fresh cut against the still air stung, the wound continuing to blossom new petals of red with every moment. Slamming my palms together in an attempt to slow the bleeding, I rushed to the restroom. 

I sprinted down the hallway to the only restroom in the whole office, leaving a trail of scarlet in my wake. As I approached, I saw the red marker on the handle. Dammit. Locked. I banged on the door, each bang of my fists accented by the sharp pain of the gash on my palm. After what felt like minutes of shouting and cracking knuckles to wood, I quieted back down. The moment I did, not a single sound followed. I took a deep breath to calm my nerves and reached into my back pocket. My wallet was thin, but the few credit cards I kept would work on the door whether they were maxed out or not. I slipped it between the door and the frame and heard the click as I slid it down. Swinging the door open, I wasn't sure what I was expecting to see. But it wasn't this. 

A bright blue dress draped over the toilet and a prestine pair of sandals sitting below. I knew that dress. Hell I'd seen 3 times in the past week whenever Tina had an ""important client"" coming in to discuss business. She wouldn't have left it laying like this, not dipping into the pooled water and draping down to the dirty floor. She'd rather die than let anything happen to that dress, and she's said that to me herself on more than one occasion. With only the emergency light on, the shadows cast crept up the walls and towered above me. I tried to knock myself out of my stupor, turning on the sink and rinsing my hand clean of blood. Thankfully we kept the first aid kit in the medicine cabinet right above the sink. Without even looking up, I popped it open and pulled the gauze out to wrap up the self-inflicted wound. A long sigh followed, reverberating off the tile and echoing far more than it had any right to.

Once I was sure the gauze was wrapped tightly, I put everything away and shut the cabinet door. The mirror glinted as it caught the light from up above, glittering red on the barely illuminated wall. As I looked in the mirror for what felt like the first time today, I could see the panic on my face. I looked so small against the backdrop of shadow behind me, looming like a predator about to pounce. I closed my eyes and splashed some water on my face, the cool sensation seeming to snap me back to some level of reality. But as I wiped the water from my eyes, I saw it. When it thought I wasn't looking. I caught it just before it went back to being perfectly still but I know what I saw. My shadow. I saw it blink.

1o8au3t,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1o8au3t/thoughts_on_traveldistance_in_general_for_a_first/,Thoughts on travel/distance in general for a first date? (M31),"I (31M) started using Hinge as of this March, so \~7 months. I took a long break from dating back when covid hit and since then poured a ton of energy into myself & career. I'm happy with where I'm at now, and inspired to keep growing/evolving as a human. What made me download a dating app was the experience of asking out a married woman (it was a very humbling experience and we've laughed about it since) - doing so and sharing w my close friends they encouraged to ""get out there"", because, ""holy crap did I asked someone out?""

My current issue is about the experiences I've had so far with Hinge matches, most recently twice have been to do with there being distance between us and me fumbling like an absolute troglodyte and I could use some help. There's two recent experiences that make me question more than just myself but whether or not I should just resign to remaining single and not touch these apps. I work a lot and prioritize my health/family/friends;

Experience 1: I matched with a woman (F 27) and all she wanted to do was exchange voice memos. It was grueling at first because it felt very intimate considering we were still strangers. I vocalized this, she dismissed it and talked about how it's her preferred method of communication - okay. So we continue this for about a week and then I ask her out to dinner. Without pause, she took to texting instead of voice memos to plan - I thought this was better than voice memo tag at least and was excited that she was excited to meet me. She imposed on coming to my city (about 30-40min away from her town), wanting to go to a restaurant she had been eyeing for a while. So we did just that - I gave her my number and address even though those are against my rules. She arrived, I met her at her car and we had a lovely dinner in the city, ended with a long walk with coffee, and it felt like we were oozing chemistry by the end. **We didn't kiss**, she has a rule about no kissing on the first date. Respect.   
  
The next day she sends me a long voice memo (not on the app, to my #) talking about how much fun she had, that she thinks I'm sexy and a great person, and that she can't wait to learn more about me - all that awesome stuff you hope to hear after a first date with someone you're interested in. She then pivoted to a rant about how much she hates driving, and it seemed in that same voice memo she realized this for the first time or something because she then went on to tell me how she isn't interested in another date because she hates having to drive. I responded asking if we could process this subject together and we talked on the phone and I pretty much laid out how I think it was wrong of her to impose on driving herself to my city for dinner without considering her general disdain for driving  and how that could inform her desires to even see me, let alone date me. I then told her how I would have loved to drive to her town last night to have dinner in her town, but since she hasn't shown any sort of curiosity in making plans as a team that she needs to delete/block my number. She didn't even know I own a car until I brought this up. I asked her to stop lying to people and herself before making dates with people and that's where that ended.

Experience 2: This one is my current pain. For the past week I matched with someone (F 28), and she checks every box I could imagine. Our convos were sweet, and she showed that she at least cared about getting to know me. So I asked her out for tacos last week and that's when she came clean that her location wasn't where she lives - that she's actually a little over 2hrs west of my city. I honestly took this in stride, I was thankful that she shared that with me and we continued talking. When she admitted to not being where her location was set at the time (she had updated it after this was brought up), she suggested that we meet halfway. Then I proposed heading out her way this week for dinner. First it was silence then she sent me a message replying to my ideas saying that she was going to feel guilty by creating a 1 sided thing (one where I do all the commuting). I simply do not care about how much I'd be driving if it means that I get to cultivate something real with someone, but I don't get to go down that path of fantastical thinking without even meeting this person. It's like the meeting halfway thing disappeared as an option altogether. She only cared about some hypothetical guilt she will put on herself in the hypothetical scenario where we enter an exclusive relationship (???). I've practically begged this woman to reconsider and talk to me about these feelings.

I hate this so much. I really don't like dishonesty, regardless of how thick my BOTD can be. What I hate more rn is that she doesn't actually seem to give an ounce of a care of how I feel atm. Maybe this is just me venting and there's no meaningful solution or path here. People can suck and that's okay. I'm just really tired of dishonest people on this app that are really convincing only for them to pull a 180 on me. I've been ghosted, cheated on, all that stuff - nothing hurts more than feeling like everything a person has said to you was disingenuous/putting on airs just to seem ""nice"". I also hated having to stifle stupid hinge-induced tears during my meetings this morning for work. I apologize in advance for how pessimistic this must read.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Gilmore was the first person in a decade to be executed in the United States after SCOTUS upheld a new series of death penalty statutes in the 1976 decision *Gregg v. Georgia*. Gilmore‚Äôs execution is the execution that truly brought the implementation of the death penalty back to America, and his execution has had lasting decades of impact on capital punishment in the U.S.¬†

Gary Gilmore was convicted in a double murder in the state of Utah, and was executed by firing squad (still a legal method of execution in 5 states) on January 17, 1977, at what used to be the Utah State Prison in Draper, UT. And he was actually looking forward to his execution by all accounts. Gilmore gained notoriety and international media attention by demanding his death sentence happen without delay, requesting specifically that he die by firing squad (over being hanged), and for becoming angry when civil rights groups attempted to interfere with his death sentence.

**Background**:¬†

Gary Gilmore was born Dec. 4, 1974, in Texas to parents Frank and Betty Gilmore. Gary was the 2nd of 4 sons to Frank and Bessie. Their other sons were: Frank Jr., Gaylen, and Mikal Gilmore. The Gilmore boys grew up in an abusive and unpredictable home, constantly moving around. Frank Sr. married a young Bessie on a bit of a whim, and actually already had multiple children with different women previously that he had no contact with and did not care about. Frank Sr. sold ads for magazines. He moved his family around a lot, most likely to get away from law enforcement in other states. In some sources, Frank Sr. is described as a professional con man. 1 time during Gary‚Äôs childhood, Frank Sr. took off to go con someone, and Gary ended up in an orphanage for a few days. The family mainly moved around the western U.S, and by the time Gary was 10, the family was living in Oregon. The Gilmores were an extremely dysfunctional family, and Gary especially had a horrible relationship with his father. Frank Sr. was an extremely violent alcoholic. Gary's brother Mikal described their father as a ""cruel and unreasonable man."" Frank Sr. would often whip Gary and his other sons in fits of rage.¬†

Gary was actually a very smart, artistic young man, who performed well in school until he dropped out at age 14 and ran away from home. He returned a few months later and started a car theft ring with some of his friends, which resulted in his first arrest. He was released to his father, Frank Sr., and given a warning. But it wouldn‚Äôt be long before Gary was in court again, facing the same charges. He was then ordered by the court to attend Oregon's MacLaren Reform School for Boys, and was released from the reform school the following year. His younger brother, Mikal, recalls seeing a noticeable change in Gary after he returned home from the reform school. Once out of reform school, Gary found himself back in the courtroom in no time on yet another car theft charge.¬†

It didn‚Äôt take long for Gary‚Äôs criminal actions to escalate. In 1962, he was arrested and sent to the Oregon State Penitentiary for armed robbery and assault. He faced assault and armed robbery charges again in 1964, and was then given a 15-year prison sentence as a habitual offender. He was granted conditional release in 1972 due to the substantial amount of time he was focusing on artwork and poetry in prison. He was released to live in a halfway house in Eugene, Oregon on weekdays, and study art at a community college; however, Gilmore never registered, and within a month he was arrested and convicted again for armed robbery. Due to his escalating violent behavior in prison, he was transferred from Oregon to the maximum security federal prison in Marion, IL in 1975. He was conditionally paroled in April 1976 and headed to the state of Utah to live with a distant cousin, who believed he deserved a ‚Äúsecond chance‚Äù at life. It was in the small Mormon, conservative town of Provo where Gary met and fell in love with a young girl named Nicole Baker Barrett, who was 3x divorced and had 2 young children. While in Utah, Gary also began working at his uncle‚Äôs shoe store, but it wouldn‚Äôt be long before small town living got too boring for him, and he began to turn back towards theft, excessive drinking, and getting into fights. Gary‚Äôs violence and alcoholism caused Nicole to leave him, and this sent Gary into the ultimate downward spiral.¬†

By the age of 35, Gary Gilmore had spent half of his life incarcerated.¬†

**Murders**

On the evening of July 19, 1976, a 24 year old BYU college student by the name of Max Jensen went to work at a local gas station in Orem, UT. Jensen was alone in the gas station when Gary pulled up, walked in, and pulled out a stolen automatic .22 pistol. He made Jensen get on the ground, and shot him once in the head at close range. He then shot Jensen again a second time in the head, with the gun right up to his skull, after saying ‚Äúfor Nicole‚Äù. By 11 PM that night, a customer had stumbled upon Jensen‚Äôs body in the gas station.

The next evening, July 20, 1976, Gary walked into the City Center Motel in Provo, UT (a city adjacent to Orem where the murder was the previous night) and demanded the cash box from the motel manager, Bennie Bushnell, also a college student at BYU. He confronted Bushnell, who also happened to live on the premises with his wife and baby. Gilmore told Ben to give him the cash box and get down on the floor. He then shot Bushnell in the head, but he didn't die instantly. But Bushnell's wife came in, and once Gilmore saw her, he grabbed the cash box and fled.

Neither of the two students had resisted Gilmore in any way. They lay on the floor as ordered and were still both shot directly in the head.

As he was trying to dispose of the stolen .22 caliber pistol used in both killings after the motel incident, Gary accidentally shot himself in the hand. This left a trail of blood from the gun to the service garage where he had left his truck to be repaired shortly before the murdering Bennie Bushnell. The garage owner, upon noticing Gilmore‚Äôs wound and hearing on a police scanner of the shooting at a nearby motel, wrote down Gilmore's license number and called the police. Gilmore's cousin turned him in to police shortly thereafter, since he had also placed a phone call to her asking for bandages and painkillers for the injury to his hand. Gilmore surrendered willingly as he was trying to drive out of Provo.

When asked by a detective why he killed Jensen and Bushnell, Gilmore said. ""I don't know. I don't have a reason."" Later he added, ""I can't keep up with life,"" the detective recounted.

**Trial and Execution**¬†

Gilmore was charged with both the murders of Bushnell and Jensen, but due to the lack of physical evidence and witnesses to the Jensen murder, he was only tried for the murder of Bennie Bushnell, the motel manager, Bushnell was survived by his wife and 2 kids. Despite expressing his desire to waive his right to a trial, Gary‚Äôs attorneys explained some of the consequences and legal ramifications, especially since he was facing the death penalty, and he agreed to be tried in court. The case went to trial on October 5, 1976. It lasted just 2 days. Gary briefly attempted to bring a legal insanity defense to the table, but this was ultimately rejected since 4 separate psychiatrists deemed him legally sane at the time of the murders. It was at this point in time where Gary really seemed to accept his fate. After brief deliberation, the jury found Gilmore guilty of first-degree murder, and sentenced him unanimously to death. Given a choice in the mode of his execution ‚Äî firing squad or hanging ‚Äî Gilmore opted to be shot, saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather be shot‚Äù, during his sentencing, as he believed a hanging could easily be botched. The death sentence was set to be carried out the following month in November.

Gilmore‚Äôs attorneys attempted to appeal his death sentence, but he refused all appeals and fired his defense counsel, seemingly willing to fully accept his fate. His denial caught the attention of the ACLU and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, who made attempts to stop the execution, on behalf of the many prisoners on death row throughout the U.S. They effectively stayed Gilmore‚Äôs execution from its original date, and this seemed to enrage Gilmore. During the ensuing legal appeals and stays, Gilmore attempted suicide twice and even went on a hunger strike in protest of the delay. One of these suicide attempts was actually a suicide pact with his girlfriend Nicole Baker Barrett. After Gary was arrested, Nicole found her way back to Gary, and they wrote intense love letters to each other while he was in prison. After the double suicide attempt, Nicole was admitted to a psychiatric hospital, and she was cut off from contacting Gillmore. Even when his mother tried to intervene on his behalf, he also had a letter published in the press to ask her to stop. Anything, Gary said, was preferable to spending the rest of his life behind bars. At a hearing in front of the board of pardons in late 1976, he stated ‚Äú... I would like them all‚Äì including that group of reverends and rabbis in Salt Lake City‚Äì to butt out. This is my life and this is my death. It‚Äôs been sanctioned by the courts that I die, and I accept that.‚Äù The last of the stays occurred on the day of his re-scheduled execution date of Jan. 17, 1977. The stay was ultimately overturned in the morning, and Gillmore‚Äôs execution was ordered to proceed as planned.¬†

On the evening of the date before his execution, Gary was served his last meal of steak, potatoes, milk, and coffee‚Äì he only drank the milk and coffee. It has also been reported that Gary's family members and friends that came to visit him on his last night snuck whiskey into the prison for him.

On the date of his execution, Gary was taken to an abandoned cannery behind the prison, which served as the death chamber. He was strapped to a chair, with a wall of sandbags set up behind him to trap the bullets. A paper target was pinned over his heart. 5 volunteer gunmen (police officers) stood concealed behind a curtain with 5 small holes, through which they aimed their rifles at the target on Gilmore's shirt. 4 guns were loaded with live rounds, and 1 gun held a blank round so the shooters could cast doubt on who fired the fatal shot.

When asked for any last words, Gary just replied: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do it.‚Äù After the prison chaplain administered Gary his last rites and the prison physician cloaked him in a black hood, Gilmore uttered his very last words to the chaplain: ‚ÄúDominus vobiscum‚Äù (Latin for: *The Lord be with you*). The chaplain replied ‚ÄúEt cum spiritu tuo‚Äù (Latin for: *And with your spirit*). Gary Gilmore was then executed around 8:08 AM on January 17, 1977. He was officially declared dead approx. 1 minute later. He had previously requested that his organs be used for transplant purposes, and 2 different people received Gillmore‚Äôs corneas. Shortly thereafter, Gillmore was cremated, and his ashes were spread from an airplane over Spanish Fork, UT. Gary had finally gotten his death wish at the age of 36, after spending about ¬Ω of his life behind bars.

Gary Gilmore is notorious for not only the brutal armed robberies and murders he committed, but he ultimately became notorious for practically begging for his death sentence after a troubled life behind bars, and the legal fallout that followed his execution can still be observed America today.

1o8an8v,https://i.redd.it/o1aee6wv1ivf1.jpeg,The Drug We Don't Call a Drug,"**Summary:** When I could smell coffee in my urine, I knew it wasn't a habit anymore - it was an addiction. Here's what 182 days without caffeine taught me about dependency, control, and the invisible addictions we normalize.

I could smell coffee when I peed. Not faintly. Not a subtle hint. I mean I could distinctly smell coffee in my urine, like my body was literally saturated with it. That's when I knew: I wasn't someone who drinks coffee. I was someone addicted to it. My hands would shake without my consent. My fingers would tremble during work sessions. The jitters were constant. But the worst part? I'd normalized all of it. ""I just love coffee,"" I'd tell people. ""It helps me focus."" Bullshit. I needed it to func...

1o8al7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1o8al7q/im_having_what_feels_like_symptoms_of_a_heart/,I'm having what feels like symptoms of a heart attack but some people have said it could be acid reflux related,"I'm 37F, 240lbs, exercise every day, good diet (very minimal processed foods/junk foods), work a desk job, and smoke weed on the weekends only. I also have an alcoholic drink once or twice on the weekends.

last week monday morning I woke up with a pain/extreme discomfort in the left side of my chest that radiated over my shoulder, around my top left back, around the side under my arm and down the back of my arm to my elbow. there was no position or place I could lay that made the pain lessen. I was clammy and sweating and at a certain point became nauseous and ended up vomiting. after I vomited the pain started to go down, very slowly over the span of a couple hours. I took an 80mg aspirin and monitored my heart rate (according to my watch it was in the low 50s during the whole incident).

through the week, I noticed the discomfort in my chest would come back any time I walked for an extended amount of time (around a store, on the treadmill, while cleaning the house). it didnt become as extreme as the first incident and didn't last as long but was still very noticeable and uncomfortable.

two mornings ago it happened again right as I woke up laying in bed, around 730am. the discomfort lasted the entire day, well into the night.

I cant recall exactly what my night before was like the first time but this last night before the second incident I had a small quesadilla around 630 and a couple beers, and then a few hours later I had a small glass of whiskey (around probably 11pm). I know it wasn't the weekend, I was on a vacation for a family reunion.

my parents have both separately said it could be due to acid reflux (i did fall asleep with a little heartburn both nights). I also noticed that after I drank coffee the first time, the pain subsided before the afternoon. I did not drink coffee after the second incident. This morning the pain in my chest started to come back as i walked around the house but now i am drinking coffee again and it has subsided, though I am currently at my desk. 

any insight would be great. i have set up a telehealth call this morning so maybe i will get some good info from there as well. in all honesty, i'm trying to avoid having a big medical bill so anything i can do at home to help this issue would be great. thank you in advance!",1,1760631550.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
