Just wanted to share a quick weeknight keto meal I've been loving lately. It's super low carb, really filling, and takes almost no time. I'm not a fan of complicated recipes, so this one checks all the boxes. Also, I found a macro tracking app that doesn‚Äôt suck - more on that below.

Quick Keto Chicken Alfredo Bowl (roughly 3g net carbs)

Ingredients (serves 1):

* 1 boneless skinless chicken thigh (or breast if you prefer)
* 1/3 cup heavy cream
* 1 tablespoon cream cheese
* 2 tablespoons grated parmesan
* Garlic powder, salt, pepper, Italian seasoning
* 1/2 cup steamed cauliflower rice

Instructions:

1. Cook the chicken however you like - I usually just sear it in a pan with some olive oil, salt, and pepper.
2. In a small saucepan, heat the cream, cream cheese, and seasonings. Stir until smooth and slightly thickened.
3. Add the parmesan, stir until it melts in, then pour the sauce over your chicken and cauliflower rice.

Takes maybe 15 minutes total, and it hits the spot when you want something warm and filling without a huge mess.

As for tracking, Ive been using this app called *My Keto: AI Low Carb Tracker*. This one‚Äôs made specifically for low-carb/keto, and it actually feels easy to use. For like the price of a coffee, it‚Äôs been totally worth it to me.

Link for anyone curious:

Anyway, hope this helps someone out. If you‚Äôve got your own go-to lazy meals or tracking tricks, would love to hear them. Always trying to keep it simple and sustainable.",1,1753863418.0,ketorecipes,1,1.0,False

She watches. And she watches some more. The stars twinkle brightly, like gems hung in the sky. A long night, and yet.

And yet, it felt so very short.

Once, she observes a pair of teenagers sneaking out together. Another time, an old lady out for a walk. The silence and bird‚Äôs eye view the tower provides is eerily comforting.

whooosh. 

the whole-ass time we were together she told me, again and again, she prefers women. we thought it was fine, because we loved each other and still had a mostly functional and at times great (but at other times, frustrating and unequal) sexual bond. but she told me at least three times in our relationship, during deep emotional talks about our relationship, that she thought she might be a lesbian. but she might also be bi. but she might be a lesbian, and does prefer women. 

we did break up back in February, or maybe early March. You'd think I'd remember that but I don't. it was a blur of tense feelings, seasonal affective depression, bad sex, and botched polyamory. she started seeing someone else-- a woman-- and did an objectively terrible job of considering my feelings and emotions. like, she agreed that she was selfish, shitty to me, and hurt me. but regardless of the break up, I was not going to kick a trans woman to the streets, even if she did just dump me, so we stayed living together. in our one bedroom apartment. with one bed. after six weeks or perhaps a bit more of still snuggling and spending every one of my days off together, we had sex again, which led to us getting back together. 

so that lasted, what, three months? she finally got a job and there's a cute femme nonbinary person there who's really flirty with her. great! she's hot and lovely and someone besides me SHOULD like her. but she hurt me very badly with polyamory in the past, so when she asked about inviting this coworker out for coffee, I said no. I got angry, which I regret, but I'm not sure it would have helped if I had stayed calm. she didn't take my no very well, and spent the day arguing that I was being unfair, and why not and it was just coffee not even a date, and I'm being controlling. I expressed that we weren't in a good place to pursue polyamory, I just wanted to set a boundary for the first time ever in our relationship and she was reacting very poorly to that. 

that was yesterday. I thought we ended the conversation productively. we had alright texting conversation today while she was at work. I was in a good mood, anyway. then after being home a few hours, she said she really thinks we should break up. so I guess it's for real this time. 

I kind of feel like she broke up with me to pursue this new person without having to feel bad. I feel like the ONE time in our whole relationship I prioritized my own needs and happiness, it ended things. I feel like she chose this person she might not even end up with over me. I feel like she broke up with me the second she wasn't dependent on me, as she's had this job three weeks and last week got her first paycheck. I feel like shit and ass and she still doesn't have anywhere to go and we still only have one bed so I don't even have space to lick my wounds. she agreed she was being shitty, and she basically said she keeps hurting me and I deserve better. but I want her to want to be better, for me. and she doesn't love me enough to do that. and she's right, if she can't love me enough to be better for me, to respect my boundaries, to take my no for an answer if it gets between her and some cute femme person she has a crush on, I do deserve better. but it really hurts and I feel really alone and I don't even know who to talk to about this because it went down at like 1am and I don't have anyone besides her I'm really close and emotionally honest with. 

I tried really, really hard and I did everything I ever could to make her happy and take care of her. for what, like, to restore her faith in humanity so she can run off and be with someone else, I guess. after she saves up for a few months and continues living with me until she can save up some for a car and her own rent. great. 

stereotypical ""if you read all this thank you!"" and idk. I feel lonely and used and unappreciated and like shit. I tried dating other people during our last failed attempt at polyamory and it sucks. it's such a slog, and even when I did meet one person I kind of liked, how do you explain the ""roommate who's my ex who I share a bed with""? and I shouldn't go running into meeting more people anyway, but I'm terrified this is the beginning of the first time I've been alone as an adult and that it'll be nice at first but I'll have a bad time when I do try to get back into dating. 

I'm hitting post instead of discard because I do need to meet new people-- friends, people I can be honest with about what's going on in my life, or just a nice comment from a stranger. so I'm going to put myself out there, as someone to talk to and someone to be a friend with, and this is my first tiny baby step. again, thanks for reading this if you did.

Hi, I‚Äôm Courtney Pochin, a specialist food writer for Metro.

I‚Äôm a passionate foodie who has reviewed some of the best dishes in London (including the world's 'best' burger), and I often get to try new products from big brands and fast food chains before they‚Äôre available to the wider public, like with the recent Big Arch launch at McDonald's. I‚Äôve also been lucky enough to interview top chefs like Jamie Oliver, Marcus Wareing and Asma Khan and learn their cooking secrets. 

Most recently, I launched a fortnightly food series for Metro called What‚Äôs Cooking, which offers a look behind the scenes in the nation‚Äôs kitchens to discover what people really eat in the comfort of their own homes.

A few things to know about me...

I‚Äôm obsessed with pasta, determined to find the best cookies in London and drink tea like Lorelai Gilmore drinks coffee.

I'm new to the concept of rucking, but I think I might have been doing it for the last few years?

It started when my kid began kindergarten. I used to walk him there with him on my back in a child carrier. After dropping him off, I would take the trail along the river back home, enjoying my morning coffee and overnight oats by the water. I kept this up until he was about four and a half, when he started to get too big for the carrier.

But I liked the feeling of walking with weight, so I switched to using a daypack and loaded it with a few PET bottles filled with water, bringing the weight to around 12kg. I‚Äôve continued walking the same 5 km forest trail with my breakfast by the river.

1md0jg7,https://i.redd.it/qjrho1uxvyff1.png,"I do thee wed.....With this Mastercard Wedding ring preloaded with USD 1,000 to spend","The wedding industry is steeped in tradition, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs immune to the transformative power of technology.

When Emma Ricci and Michael Zhang exchanged vows last fall, their rings held more than promises‚Äîit held their bank accounts. Embedded with Mastercard contactless chips and crafted in lustrous silver and gold finishes, the Orukka smart rings they slipped onto their fingers are part wedding band, part digital wallet.¬†



**From Romance to Retail**

The idea sounds futuristic: a ring that lets you pay by tapping your finger at the cash register. But Orukka‚Äôs founders see it as an emotional extension of what rings traditionally signify. Instead of gold serving purely as ornamentation, the metal now denotes convenience, security, and luxury. The ring, lightweight and waterproof, never requires charging. ‚ÄúCash, wallets, bags and plastic bank cards are now outdated,‚Äù proclaims the Monesave‚Äôs CEO, Patrick Enin.¬†



  


**Minimalism Meets Luxury**

Orukka by Monesave launched what it bills as the world‚Äôs first Mastercard‚Äëenabled payment ring, a minimalist wearable meant to replace not just wallets, but even phones and credit cards.

The trend aligns with growing generational demands for digital minimalism. As Gen Z and younger Millennials reject screen dependency, Orukka taps into a desire for wearable technology that is discreet and screen‚Äëfree. ¬†

  


  


**The technology**

Security seems built in. The rings use tokenized NFC tied to Mastercard for spending and Monesave App for tracking, and the embedded financial credentials remain encrypted on the device. In the unlikely event of loss, users can freeze their ring remotely via the app, unlike lost physical cards.¬†



Compatible with virtually all major banks and cards worldwide. They require no Bluetooth, no PIN under standard tap limits, and plug into a single app for setup, transaction history, and exclusive discount and events for ring holders.¬†

  


  


**Beyond the Wedding Day**

While weddings remain a signature moment for Orukka, the brand is positioning its wearables for long-term lifestyle usage. Many users also choose fitness versions of the ring or bracelets‚Äîswappable within the same app ecosystem‚Äîto pay for daily coffee, gym entry, or event tickets.

‚ÄúOur smart ring was built for people who want to leave their phone behind‚Ä¶ still pay securely‚Äîwhether commuting, grabbing coffee, or running a 10K,‚Äù the company explained when announcing a partnership with city-running events.

  


**Why It Matters**

At a time when wearable technology seems dominated by screens‚Äîsmartwatches, fitness bands, augmented‚Äëreality glasses‚ÄîOrukka‚Äôs rings reflect a countervailing impulse toward subtlety and permanence. The ring, worn every day and often symbolizing lifelong commitment, seems a natural host for payments once carried in leather wallets.



**Orukka Smart Rings and Bracelets by Monesave** is a fintech.

Product launch: Smart payment ring approved by Mastercard, available globally from¬† since 2024. Users can order their Rings and Bracelets here

I asked Reddit, ""what if I want a cup now, and can't wait for hours?"" and I landed on Aeropress as the answer.

It's become my goto method for a few years now, and I have no desire to move to another method, let alone measure grams of anything.

I thought I'd check with the inventor's recommendations on brew time, and got the following from Dia browser. Maybe, if you're just getting started in the brew it yourself space and don't want to invest in a bunch of expensive equipment, this answer will inspire you as it did me.

""**Cold Brewing with the AeroPress: What‚Äôs Known**¬†

* **Inventor‚Äôs Recommendation:** Alan Adler, the inventor of the AeroPress, has suggested that you can make a cold brew concentrate by steeping coffee grounds in room temperature or cold water for about 1‚Äì2 minutes before pressing. This is much shorter than the 12‚Äì24 hours typically required for traditional cold brew.
* **Process Overview:**
   * Use a fine or medium grind.
   * Add coffee and cold or room temperature water to the AeroPress.
   * Stir for 1‚Äì2 minutes.
   * Press slowly.
   * Dilute the resulting concentrate with water, milk, or a milk alternative, and add ice if desired.
* **Flavor Profile:** The result is a smoother, less acidic coffee compared to hot brewing, but with more aroma and body than standard cold brew due to the shorter extraction time and pressure applied during pressing.
* **Why It Works:** The AeroPress‚Äôs pressure and agitation help extract flavors quickly, even at lower temperatures.
* **Variations:** Some users experiment with longer steep times (up to 5 minutes) for a richer flavor, but most agree that 1‚Äì2 minutes is sufficient for a pleasant cold brew concentrate.

**Research & Community Consensus**¬†

* **Speed:** The AeroPress is unique in its ability to produce a cold brew in minutes rather than hours.
* **Taste:** Many coffee enthusiasts find AeroPress cold brew to be more aromatic and less bitter than traditional cold brew, though it may be less sweet and mellow.
* **Flexibility:** You can adjust grind size, coffee-to-water ratio, and steep time to suit your taste.""

Only using 20% of our capacity. How do I grow from here?","\*Not Promotion - Looking for Advice - Please read\*

Hi guys!

To give some context, I am one of the co-founders of a Montreal, Canada based freeze dried candy manufacturer.

Our products are carried by over 2000 locations canada-wide.

We have a 4000sqft manufacturing facility, and we manufacture, package and sell freeze dried candy and treats.

Naturally, having access to such equipment also gives us the possibility to offer private label (freeze dried candy) under someone‚Äôs own brand.

But also simply packaging/bagging service (ie: filling mylar bags with candy, gummies, supplements, coffee beans, and virtually any Consumer Packaged Goods that can be packaged and sold in Mylar bags).

We‚Äôve also developed our own software, in-house, for CPG gamification (at the packaging level, think ‚Äúwin prizes in every bag‚Äù type deal).

We can offer this software independently, whether they choose to employ our packaging/private label service OR not.

This is one of the biggest projects we‚Äôve undertaken. **We‚Äôre only using about 20% of our production capacity, so we need to fill in that remaining 80% one way or another.**

I was curious to pick everybody‚Äôs brain on how we can:

1. Quickly obtain additional retailer listings (USA/Canada), or distributors.
2. Find CPG brands that need their products packaged in North America (specifically in Mylar bags)
3. Find brands or companies wanting to launch their own brand of freeze dried candy (private labeling)
4. Offer our turnkey gamification solution to existing brands that might want to step up their offering.

Naturally, we‚Äôre more familiar with Canada. But we‚Äôre about to obtain our export license and our facility is currently undergoing FDA registration, so we‚Äôll be able to export to the USA in just a week or two.

Here's where they shine and what made me write this review - the other day my daughter (toddler) picked up the case and dropped it in my cup of hot coffee. Took me almost a minute to fish it out without burning myself, thought it was going to be broken for sure, but some how it kept functioning just fine. 

A few days later, I myself accidentally dropped the right ear bud into my milk shake. Again, took me a good 30 seconds to fish it out. The touch sensors were basically unusable for the rest of the day, but the next morning after it had dried out, it works perfectly again.

Don't know if this is common for these types of electronics to be so durable but I thought given both components contain their own power source/battery I am quite surprised there was no short circuit or malfunction.

They'll probably corode inside more quickly than they should (if they'd never been wet) but short term (this all happened in the last 7 days) they still work flawlessly. ",1,1753860756.0,Earbuds,0,1.0,False

1mczzcj,https://i.redd.it/x9jrg2r0pyff1.jpeg,I flew to Vietnam from India just to buy a MacBook,"Hey folks I have been invited to post this,

A while back I posted on a few subreddits about an idea I had. Flying from India to Vietnam, buying a MacBook there, and coming back... hopefully saving some cash. A few people said it‚Äôs doable, but many suggested I should explore Vietnam too, so I did. üòé

If you‚Äôre planning to buy a MacBook or iPhone worth ‚Çπ2 lakh+ in India trust me it's worth making a short trip to Vietnam. You‚Äôll get the device cheaper¬†*and*¬†squeeze in a mini vacation.

# My Story & Experience

* Got my eVisa, booked the cheapest round-trip flight (‚Çπ19K), and headed to Hanoi, the capital.
* Stayed 11 nights (was working remotely not recommended, But I had good time. more on that later).
* Explored nearby places on weekends or evenings, and yes bought my MacBook there!

# Tips from Experience

* **Don‚Äôt take your work laptop**¬†and plan to ‚Äúwork and travel.‚Äù Just take 4-7 days off and enjoy. You won‚Äôt cover the entire country anyway.
* I only traveled for 5 days during my 11-night stay and honestly, that was more than enough for a refreshing experience.

# Where I Bought My MacBook M4 Pro

After visiting more than 15 stores in nearby areas.

‚úÖ¬†**Good Store (Price matched FPT, gave tax refund document)**:  
FPT Shop: P. ƒê·ªôi C·∫•n/279 P. Ng·ªçc H√†, Ng·ªçc H·ªì, Ba ƒê√¨nh, H√† N·ªôi, Vietnam

‚ùå¬†**Bad Store (Overpriced, and was bargaining in MAcBook - Is this vegetable shop?)**:  
F. Studio (by FPT)- Apple Authorized Reseller: 92 P. Hai B√† Tr∆∞ng, C·ª≠a Nam, Ho√†n Ki·∫øm, H√† N·ªôi, Vietnam

* Always ask: ‚ÄúDo you provide VAT refund documents for the airport?‚Äù Some stores won‚Äôt.
* They even helped me¬†*carefully*¬†open the MacBook to inspect it and resealed it for airport VAT refund smart move!
* **VAT Refund Counter:**¬†Noi Bai Airport, Gate No. 31. I got back \~$111 (8.5% minus charges).

# Cost Breakdown

|Item|Cost (INR)|
|:-|:-|
||
|||
|Round trip flight|‚Çπ19,000|
|E-Visa|‚Çπ2,210|
|Ha Long Bay|‚Çπ5,500|
|Ninh Binh|‚Çπ4,500|
|Stay (11 nights)|‚Çπ4,000|
|Food & Extra|‚Çπ5,000|
|**Total Trip**|**\~‚Çπ40,000**|

# The MacBook Deal

* **MacBook Pro M4 Pro 14"" (Base 24GB/512GB)**
   * **India (Amazon):**¬†‚Çπ1,89,900
   * **With card offers:**¬†\~‚Çπ1,85,000
   * **Vietnam (after refund):**¬†\~‚Çπ1,48,500 (I paid total ‚Çπ1,58,125 at store and got $111 refund at airport )

**üßÆ Net Savings on MacBook alone: ‚Çπ36,500**  
So basically, add ‚Çπ5K and you got yourself a brand-new MacBook¬†*and*¬†a vacation in Vietnam.

# If You Plan To Do This, Read This First:

* üçú Vegetarian? Food hunt might be tricky. Double check¬†*every time*¬†(It's expensive)
* ‚òï Must try¬†*Coconut Coffee*
* üöå Public transport in Hanoi is¬†**super cheap**¬†and reliable. Google Maps + their local apps are just too good. Just show the conductor your destination. (This will save fuck loads of money)
* üí≥ Get a¬†**forex card**, pay via card wherever you can.
* üíµ Cash still needed for small/local places & ticket counters.
* ‚òî Avoid rainy season (I got hit by WiFa storm, couldn‚Äôt go to Sapa).
* üõçÔ∏è Use FPT Shop‚Äôs website to check legit Mac pricing.
* üö¥üèªDownload Grab (Helps with cab, bike, food, groceries)

# Final Total I Spent

* **MacBook + 11-day trip total:**¬†‚Çπ2,08,117 (before refund)
* **After tax refund:**¬†‚Çπ1,97,000 approx.
* So if I deduct the cost of the MacBook alone, my 11-night Vietnam trip was just ‚Çπ48K and that too while working!

Feel free to ask if you're planning a similar trip happy to share more deets. üòÑ

Honestly, I had never really thought about using one until a few days ago when I was on a trip and using public Wi-Fi. I started getting a little paranoid about my security, especially when I had to log into a bunch of accounts for work and emails. So I decided to take the plunge and try it out.

I downloaded the app from the VPN provider‚Äôs website. It was super easy to find, but I had no idea what I was doing. I just clicked through the setup process, which prompted me to allow the app to create a VPN configuration on my phone. The whole thing took about two minutes. Once it was done, I could see a little ‚ÄúVPN‚Äù icon on the top of my phone whenever it was connected.

I tested it by connecting to a Wi-Fi network in a coffee shop, and it was pretty seamless. No noticeable slowdowns, and I felt a lot more secure browsing around. It's definitely been a bit of a game-changer since I‚Äôm constantly on the move and hopping between different networks.

Our products are carried by over 2000 locations canada-wide.

We have a 4000sqft manufacturing facility, and we manufacture, package and sell freeze dried candy and treats.

Naturally, having access to such equipment also gives us the possibility to offer private label (freeze dried candy) under someone‚Äôs own brand.

But also simply packaging/bagging service (ie: filling mylar bags with candy, gummies, supplements, coffee beans, and virtually any Consumer Packaged Goods that can be packaged and sold in Mylar bags).

We‚Äôve also developed our own software, in-house, for CPG gamification (at the packaging level, think ‚Äúwin prizes in every bag‚Äù type deal).

We can offer this software independently, whether they choose to employ our packaging/private label service OR not.

I‚Äôd love to chat or be pointed in the right direction by some of our fellow redditors here.

Our immediate goals are to:

1) Obtain additional retailer listings (USA/Canada)

2) Find CPG brands that need their products packaged in North America (specifically in Mylar bags)

3) Find brands or companies wanting to launch their own brand of freeze dried candy (private labeling)

4) Offer our turnkey gamification solution to existing brands.

1mczt2m,https://www.reddit.com/r/rs_x/comments/1mczt2m/ai_has_infiltrated_history_museums/,AI has infiltrated history museums,"Yesterday I went to a history museum in Georgetown, Penang, Malaysia. Penang is a fascinating island with  incredible depth of diversity and colonial legacy, beautiful architecture and incredibly culturally layered. Incredible food, some of the best food I've had in SE Asia by far. 

But the tropical heat is brutal.  To seek respite from the tropical heat, I went to a well reviewed museum ""showcasing old Penang"". It was a bit too Temu Madame Tussauds from the get go, filled with poorly done up figures of Hokkien Chinese shopkeepers and English colonial officers,  but I figured the artifacts and info would be worth it. 

But from the first introductory hall, I knew something was amiss. A room of fake vintage CRT TVs playing AI generated videos of Penang colonial street scenes, AI generated newsreels from WW2, AI generated Malay village life. All presented as if it's real. No label denoting if it's fake or not. 

Then room after room showcasing the history and commerce of the Penang of old used more and more AI as I went. It was all so disorienting and nauseating.  Vintage shop signs that look like they could be from 1910, but you look close and the coffee advertisement has misspelled sweetened as ""smeetnd"" , or used some fake script altogether. The framed historic black and white picture of old steamships at port flies blurred flags reminiscent of the Union jack, but not quite. A fake newspaper showing cheering crowds celebrating the liberation from Japanese wartime occupational are filled with swirled and distorted faces, arms and bodies that blur together, not a single complete human because the AI is unable to convincingly generate a crowd scene. Everywhere you look, it was all fake bullshit, pretending to be history. 

Some AI was slightly more defensible, because it was obviously undeniably AI, like portraits of famous Penang figures ""brought to life"" by AI video. I guess people can see these people move around, and the museum doesn't have to pay reenactors or animators. Whoopee. But having colonial founder of Penang Francis Light swerving his head around in this strange uncanny AI fashion, unable to make eye contact like he's Rainman, it's fucking creepy! And they all talk in this weird, similar robot AI voice. It's unsettling and infuriating and just wrong.

History museums should be a place where we can trust what we see as the truth. Where the lived realities of the past can be studied and trusted. The veracity of each artifact shouldn't be scrutinized, and I shouldn't have to study the eyes or count the number of legs in the crowd to know whether this footage I'm looking at is real or not. I mean, this place wasn't an academically rigourous institution, and they clearly want to emphasize accessibility to tourists, but still. Why the hell does this bullshit, generated slop get into everything? Fucking history museums? It's not needed! If only serves to confuse and disturb anyone with half a brain paying close attention.

I'm not proud to admit this but I probably brushed less than 30 times throughout all of highschool. In fact, my parents never pushed dental hygiene on me so I probably brushed like once or twice a month \*at most\* before I went to college and started taking better care of myself. 

Despite that, my teeth are still real straight; More surprisingly, they're a healthy color despite me having a real bad coffee & cigarette addiction for a while. I've always chalked it up to me being young but I know other people my age who (respectfully) have pretty messed up teeth, and I don't think their dental hygiene could get much worse than my adolescent self.

1mczmn8,https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepEssentialsIndia/comments/1mczmn8/how_to_wake_up_better_and_actually_feel_awake/,How to Wake Up Better (and Actually Feel Awake),"Ever notice how your mood and energy in the morning can feel completely random? Turns out, a lot of that comes down to *how* you wake up not just how long you sleep. And if you‚Äôre like most people whose workdays start early, figuring this out makes a big difference.

(Of course, none of this will work wonders if your overall sleep quality is poor  more on that in the rest of my blog.)

# Why Waking Up in Light Sleep Helps

The ideal time to wake up is during light sleep. It‚Äôs much easier for your body to transition from light sleep to being awake, compared to being jolted out of deep sleep.

Unfortunately, most loud, sudden alarms do exactly that: yank us out of deeper sleep stages, leaving us groggy.

Better options include:

* Alarms that gradually get louder over 15‚Äì20 minutes instead of blaring instantly.
* Leaving your curtains open so natural sunlight wakes you gently.
* Using a smartwatch or fitness tracker that monitors your sleep cycle and wakes you during light sleep within a set window.

Even then, it helps to set a backup alarm for your latest acceptable wake-up time just to make sure you actually get out of bed.

# What to Do if You Still Feel Tired

Even with smart alarms and careful timing, some mornings you‚Äôll still wake up feeling like a zombie. Maybe you didn‚Äôt sleep well, or your body‚Äôs just off that day. What then?

Here are some practical tricks to help kickstart your morning:

* Take a cold shower or at least splash your face with cold water.
* Try washing your forearms with cold water for about 30 seconds. Weirdly effective!
* Drink a glass of cold water right after you get up.

If you need an extra boost:

* Caffeine (coffee, tea) helps, but be mindful of how much.
* Sugary drinks work too, but aren‚Äôt great for daily use.
* Healthier option: do some light cardio, stretch, or even just step outside into the sunlight to help reset your body clock.

# Bottom Line

Waking up better isn‚Äôt just about setting an earlier alarm, it‚Äôs about timing, gentle triggers, and having backup habits to get you moving on rough mornings. Combined with good sleep quality, these small tweaks can make mornings feel a lot less like a fight and a lot more like a fresh start.",1,1753858362.0,SleepEssentialsIndia,0,1.0,False

No matter how long you have been living with discomfort or slept off last week, the correct chiropractor can assist in making the first step toward getting better. In an area that lets time fly, your healing should not be left behind. The solution may be a healthier spine that can unlock a better and pain-free you***

The right moment does not come when it comes to back pain. It comes at the job or when doing errands, or even when taking your morning coffee. The permanent relief has now turned into a necessity among residents in Westchester. That is where the modern [Chiropractic Care](https://www.ryechiro.com/) is involved, with their strategy that is non-invasive, precise, and, yet life-changing. In the case of [Back Pain Chiropractic Westchester](https://www.ryechiro.com/back-pain/) there is more than just simply cracking backs; it is all about getting your life back, getting your life under control.

**Why Chiropractic Treatment Is Not All About Health Care**

The main aim of chiropractic care is to straighten your back, relieve your nerve pressure and make your body realign its natural mechanics. However, its advantages go way beyond the spine itself. When done with the correct practitioner, the patients cite that they sleep better, have better posture, fewer migraines, and even improved focus.

The most interesting? It is non-invasive and drug-free. Instead of addressing temporary solutions, chiropractic adjustments target the source of the problem. That is why selecting a competent Back Pain Chiropractor Westchester is not only a choice of treatment but also a well-being plan.

**Tailor-Made Solutions to Permanent Relief**

Every spine is different and that is why all homosexual treatment is not the same. The most reputable chiropractors in Westchester will devote a few moments to review your posture, your range of movement, your everyday routine, and your tension degree. Out of that, they will develop a care plan that best suits your life and not vice versa.

¬†There are patients who require a set of mild adjustments for a number of weeks. People can make use of posture correction, ergonomic recommendations or supportive stretches. It is just a matter of going to the bottom of the problem and developing it with it.

¬†**The Local Touch: Why Westchester Makes a Difference**

¬†Westchester is a place where you commute a lot, have a lot of things to do on your agenda, and occasionally--where you spend a lot of time in a traffic jam. With these lifestyle facts, the health of the spine is more vital than before. The local chiropractors are aware of such a pace and adjust their care as well.

¬†When finding Back Pain Chiropractic Westchester there is a tendency for many patients to find the experience quite holistic and happy about. It is not so much treating but listening, learning and guiding a baby since the initial assessment all the way to the last fine-tuning. It is a local way of doing that with the quality of professionals.",1,1753858091.0,u_ryechiro,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve tested my fair share of juicers over the years, but this one felt like something special right from the unboxing. Its sturdy design paired with a quiet yet powerful motor made it feel like I was handling a high-end appliance. While the product dimensions are compact at 6.5 inches deep, 10.6 inches wide, and 13.39 inches tall, it's the whisper-quiet operation that truly stole my heart. Waking up early to make juice without waking the entire house? Absolute bliss.

**Ease of Use and Thoughtful Features**

When I first set it up, the straightforward design and user-friendly button controls stood out. It didn‚Äôt take long to realize how well this juicer aligns with a beginner or someone who prefers simplicity. The stainless-steel blade material ensures durability, and while the product isn't dishwasher safe, cleaning it by hand wasn‚Äôt the chore I expected it to be. The juicer does its job with precision, working at a slow and steady 80 revolutions per minute to minimize oxidation and preserve the nutrients in fruits and veggies. From kale to apples and even carrots, this machine didn‚Äôt falter.

**Versatility Beyond Juice**

What I didn‚Äôt realize at first is that the Omega J8006 isn‚Äôt limited to creating fresh juice. During my trials, I used it to make nut milk and even experimented with grinding coffee beans. This level of versatility isn't something I‚Äôve seen often in other masticating juicers. It also handled softer and tougher produce equally well. Whether it‚Äôs stringy celery or juicy oranges, the end result was smooth, pulp-free liquid. For someone like me who enjoys trying new recipes, this juicer felt like an all-in-one kitchen assistant.

**Pluses**

- The motor is extraordinarily quiet, which is perfect for households with different schedules.  
- Extracts juice efficiently with minimal waste, leaving bone-dry pulp behind.  
- Versatile enough to handle nut butter, baby food, and even pasta with additional attachments.  
- Slow-speed masticating helps preserve nutrients and flavor better than centrifugal juicers.  

**Minus Points**

- While compact, at 17.81 pounds, it‚Äôs not the lightest option to move or reposition often.  
- Cleaning does take a bit of patience since parts need to be washed manually.  
- Expensive compared to some centrifugal juicers, though arguably worth the investment.  

**Build and Aesthetic Appeal**

Its white metallic finish with a professional-grade design feels effortlessly modern. Sitting on my counter, it looks more like a statement piece than a practical kitchen gadget. The build quality also reflects durability‚Äîthis thing feels like it could last years without a hiccup.

**Competitive Options**

When placing the Omega J8006 against its competitors like the Breville Juice Fountain Cold or Kuvings Whole Slow Juicer, each has its merits. Breville is quicker due to being centrifugal but compromises on nutrient retention. Kuvings offers a larger feeding chute, but its bulky design doesn‚Äôt match the sleekness of the Omega J8006. What sealed the deal for me was how the slow masticating process extracts better quality juice compared to centrifugal models. The ability to work on different items beyond juice production places this juicer a notch above others in the same category.

**Bang for the Buck**

I‚Äôll admit, this isn‚Äôt the cheapest product on the market, but its long-term value makes up for the initial investment. I‚Äôve noticed a significant reduction in wasted produce since it gets the most out of fruits and veggies. Unlike some cheaper models prone to breaking down or losing efficiency over time, this one holds its ground well even with regular use. The added benefit of multi-functionality‚Äîmaking nut milk and grinding coffee‚Äîreally increases the cost-effectiveness. If you‚Äôre someone who invests in tools that last and adapt to different uses, this juicer is worth considering.

You‚Äôll also get a feed of what others nearby are up for. And if you prefer, you can post anonymously too.

Think of it like a friend-focused version of Bumble or Tinder, but with a twist. I know Bumble has a BFF mode, but it‚Äôs not active in Pakistan. And even then, this idea is a bit different. Instead of just browsing profiles and figuring out what to do after matching (like on BFF), here people post what they actually want to do, like ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs hit the local snooker or Tekken club,‚Äù and others with shared interests can join in.

Actually, I analyzed over 100 Reddit posts across various Pakistani social subreddits and observed a pattern in their common problems. I want to make an app for that. I want to validate that app idea before development, really looking for you guys to post your thoughts. It‚Äôs not a dating app, I promise! Men will only find men, and women will only see women. Common problems I want to solve:

\-Moved to a new city and need someone to talk to or meet in person  
\-Looking for like-minded person for morning walks or casual hangouts (No-Dating)  
\-Want to attend a nearby event (MMA, Tekken, Chess tournament, Book Fair) but no friends share that interest.  
\-Need a gym partner to go to a local gym together.  
\-Seeking a local cat lover/gamer/book lover  
\-Looking for a local neighbor to play badminton/chess/cards, etc

Let's try to answer some questions you have in your mind:

Q: Why not just talk with someone locally?  
A: Many people are introverted and feel more comfortable starting online before meeting in person. For example, if I go to the local gym, then I will not ask anyone if I want to be a gym partner with you. I'm more comfortable putting that request in some app, and let's see who wants to join.

Q: Why not use existing social Reddit communities like those for Karachi and Islamabad??  
A: Those lack precise GPS‚Äëbased proximity filters. Also, it lacks interest-based feeds/matching.

Q: How will you keep it secure?  
A: We‚Äôll include safety prompts, encourage public meeting spots, and follow proven best practices similar to OLX or Tinder (but strictly for friendship).

Q: How would the app know that a person is a woman/ man?  
A: I hope that the problem is already solved by Tinder/Bumble or other dating apps. Maybe we do ID verification.

There are some apps already there, but not operating in Pakistan like ""Bumble-For-Friends"", ""GoFriendly"", etc.

I want to validate this mobile app idea and would really appreciate your thoughts. Would you use an app like this? Why or why not? What features would make it feel safe and useful for you? Have you tried anything similar before? What worked and what didn‚Äôt?

Then i press the coffee and until this part,it seems ok. Not too much coffee,even surface etc.

Then i do a flush without the portafilter.

Now the problems begins: using the automatic mode, the extracting time is too random (but usually shorter than indicated).

I tried using the manual shot, so kept pressing for 6 o 7 seconds and then stop the pre extraction and counting 30 sec.

Also when the weight and the e.t. seems correct, the coffee always taste sour, no matter what. I also tried  the other coffee and results are very similar. Coffee was roasted 27/06 and seems ok.

1mczdor,https://i.redd.it/p9b9u1dyhyff1.jpeg,Red John's Global Plan,"I've spent most of my life in the SCD(smart characters) community, many people know about this theory there, but I haven't seen anyone talk about it here. So I want to share a theory about Red John's global plan that has been going on for several years. This theory also explains how John knew about the suspect list.

Several years before Patrick compiled the list, Red John analyzes the psychology and appearance of 6 people who look like him in every sense and may be suitable for the candidacy of Red John. As a result, he manipulates everyone who will be on the list in the future so that they gradually give Jane certain tips.
1. Let's start with Brad Styles. Several faces hinted at him. In episode 7 of season 3, Stiles said that John is planning a surprise for Patrick, and after 4 episodes, an explosion occurs in Lisbon's car. Stiles also hints that he knows John, because he tells Patrick the phrase: ""I know a lot more than you think."" Stiles then hands Jane an envelope containing the location of Christina Fry. And the last reason is that I became acquainted with John and was impressed by his intelligence. Everything that is indicated here and in all other points was prepared in advance by John.
2. Now Reed Smith. Firstly, John said that he had a good friend in the FBI, and Smith, at one time, quit his job at the CBI and transferred to the FBI because of non-envy of Patrick. Patrick also noted that Smith has violent instincts that he suppresses.
3. It will go to Bertram. In fact, he has the least evidence. In the episode where John wants to kill Hightower and Patrick gives all the suspects different room numbers, the killer initially enters the apartment whose number was given to Bertram, but this turns out to be a mistake. But there was a strange moment when Bertram ridiculed the fact that Patrick was at the limit of his abilities, after Hightower did not appear at the meeting place.
4. Next up is Ray Haffner. Lisbon suggested that he might be John due to the fact that Heffner was a member of the Visualize sect when John committed the double murder of its members (episode 13, episode 5). He was also Patrick's former boss, and Jane disgraced him, for which Haffner hated him.
5. Now it's Brett Partridge. He clearly dislikes Jane and admires John, which is clearly seen in the episode ""Red Sky in the Morning"", where he says that he was delighted to see John's symbol in person. He confused the investigation with John's case several times. Unhealthy things also excite him. Finally, let's recall the finale, that is, episode 8 of season 6, where Patrick says that it was Partridge who helped John in the extraction of artificial body parts.
6. Let's move on to Bob Kirkland. He clearly has an unhealthy interest in John, and is also involved in the Lorelei Martins case. But he works for the Ministry of the Interior, which deals with terrorism, not murder. He shook Jane's hand just before Lorelei said that Patrick and Red John had already shaken hands. He also participated in her search in the episode ‚ÄúThere will be Blood‚Äù, while Bertram gives National Security complete freedom (This further sets Bertram up). There is such an interest in the fact that John allegedly killed Kirkland's brother. John anticipated this and used it in his plan to get Bob on Patrick's list, which happened.
7. Let's move on to Thomas McCallister. During their first meeting, in episode 2 of season 1, he told Jane a strange phrase: ""People look different when they're dead, don't they?"". Let's also recall his strange behavior in the same episode.

Let's look at how John helped Patrick create a psychological profile.
Sophia Miller was Patrick's psychologist after his wife's death. John went to her for a session so that Jane could get his psychological profile. At this time, he tells a few facts about himself. He notes that he has acrophobia, fear of heights, he says this, knowing that Reed Smith is afraid of heights, he also says that he does not have a family, he deliberately lies badly so that she thinks that he is a narcissist and is hiding something. John finds out in advance that she does not write anything down on paper, but writes on a dictaphone and some company is sad for her. After he kills her, John steals these recordings to pretend that there is something important there that he wants to hide. But he knows that Patrick knows about the company printing for Sofia, and that he will go there to get the records.

Consider how John helped Patrick create a physical profile.
1. Used Rosalind Hafner, a blind girl. with whom he had an affair.
She has compiled an appearance profile, namely: ""Height about 6 feet. Not muscular, but not soft either. Short straight hair and a gentle voice. He also had strong hands and smelled of pine trees."". But because she's blind, she couldn't reveal any serious information.
2. In the episode ‚ÄúRed Rover, Red Rover‚Äù Red John approached the young girl and asked her to pass a piece of paper to the next person who came, assuming that this person would be Patrick Jane. He expected the girl to tell Patrick that Red John was white. Therefore, Red John selected suspects based on their ethnicity.

I also suggest that you remember how John remembered the murder that he committed 25 years before making the list. It was completely on a farm that belonged to the Vizualize sect. Thanks to which he framed both Haffner and Brad Styles.

Let's take a separate look at Loralea Martins. Since she played perhaps the most important role.
It all started with the fact that when Patrick was faking a nervous breakdown, Lorelei, on John's orders, sat down with Jane in a bar. Later, when he was detained by the police, Lorelei posted bail in his place. Then Lorelei went to Patrick's house, she knew the address, as the policeman from Patrick's prison gave it to her thanks to John's influence. She says that they have formed a bond, they sleep together, and in the morning she makes scrambled eggs, which Jane loves, obviously this is part of John's plan. She then says that she is following John's orders and Patrick, if anything, knows where to find her. When he comes to meet her, she tells him to bring Lisbon's head. Then she sees on the news that Rigby has been killed and Lisbon is missing. Lorelei says John wants to meet Patrick. When he arrives at the place, there is a bicycle with a paper on which the address is written. Arriving at the place, he sees Lorelei. John understood that Patrick would work with friends from the CBI, but the FBI might be on their trail. In the car that Patrick arrived at, he talks to John and rejects his offer. To which John replies that he has a good friend in the FBI and orders Lorelei to cut off Patrick's finger. But the FBI is on time. They manage to capture John's allies, but the CBI chief turns out to be in the car, who was hit during the shooting at the car. Lorelei was sent to jail and she tells Patrick that John will get her out and Jane tells him to strengthen the guard. When Patrick comes to the prison to visit Lorelei, he sees another prisoner there. It turns out that the prisoner carrier, Walter Demann, was blackmailed by the FBI and he transported Lorelei to a federal prison.
Brad Styles then offers Patrick a favor to get her out of jail. When Patrick pulled Lorelei out, it strengthens their bond and her belief that John abandoned her, which is actually beneficial for him. Later, she will tell you about John's plan. The police will then question Lorelei's mother, who will be forced to tell about Lorelei's sister and how she died. This will encourage the investigators and Patrick Jane to take care of the sister, which is what Red John wanted and expected. After Patrick started talking about the murder of Lorelei's sister, which happened 10 years ago, John wrote ""Roy"" on the wall, this case was never made public. At first, Lorelei didn't trust him, as he had no proof, she even found the perfect moment to make Patrick Jane believe that she had made a mistake with the handshake, she said: ""You're both such manipulators, I'm surprised you didn't become friends when you met."" Lorelei reappears when she breaks into the house of a woman named Julia Howard, who runs a shelter for abused women, and tortures her for information about who killed her sister, because after Patrick's words she had doubts.
Later, Patrick brings her a photo from the murder scene with the inscription ""Roy"", which finally strengthens Lorelei's belief that John betrayed her. Then, by questioning and torturing people, she gathered information about who was the guy who knows who killed her sister, then she went to this guy and he told her that Red John killed her. She is going to kill John and prepare for it, but John foresaw it from the very beginning and was ready, because he planned all the actions. So he can catch her, after which he forces her to record a video with a list, and then kills her.

I would also like to note that many who knew John said that he looked very much like Patrick. Red John asked Lorelei to suggest that Patrick might wonder why they didn't become lifelong friends, strengthening that bond. 
In addition, Rebecca repeats this opinion in the second season, in episode 8.
And to further mislead Patrick, Red John made sure that the suspects he chose displayed behaviors and traits that reflected his own personality.

The tape with the suspects.
His strategy begins with a crime he commits in a hotel, he kills a young woman, Eileen Turner, and kidnaps her child, he also places a phone number next to his sign corresponding to the orphanage where Patrick spent some time as a child. When they came to the shelter, the manager said that Eileen Turner's ex-husband was aggressive and could be responsible for it. She gave them the address, and Patrick recognized the place immediately, as he had been there before. Red John, of course, foresaw all this. Patrick went to the specified address and saw that people he knew and spent time with in his youth lived there. He asked them where to find the victim's ex, and they said they didn't know. Patrick and Lisbon left, and Patrick decided that they would call the former victim and let him know what was going on. Patrick also came to the conclusion that he was innocent and would rush to the crime scene because he had done nothing. Then they managed to catch him when he was at the scene of the crime and they arrested him. When Patrick was at the station, when he saw his ex, he came to the conclusion that he seemed to be thinking about someone else who could have committed the murder. This intrigued Patrick, and he decided to look for information about Eileen's family. The investigation revealed Patrick's potential suspect, Sean, and it also made him remember Eileen and her family. The memory of Eileen that he recalled was Patrick Jane's happy memory from his youth: a 12-year-old girl laughing while he watched her. 
Patrick says, ""It's like John just got into my head and killed the happy memories."" Patrick then developed a strategy: he told the two main suspects, Sean and his ex, that the child was in a shelter. The one who comes will be innocent, while the one who doesn't come because he already had a child will be guilty. He did this with the help of the orphanage manager. Both suspects were detained because neither of them was guilty. At that moment, Van Pelt called Patrick Jane and informed him that the child had been found in the hospital. Patrick hung up the phone, but suddenly realized that he had not asked Van Pelt which hospital he was in, and tried to call her back, but his battery ran out, which caused the call to be immediately interrupted. He then asked the manager for her phone number to call Van Pelt, but in fact it was just a ploy to track down the location of the manager's last call. Patrick concluded that the manager entrusted the baby to someone and stole it, because, quote: ‚Äúdiapers and milk were taken from a hotel room, which suggests that John's partner was a thrifty, very organized, pedantic person who could take care of a child, probably middle-aged.- an elderly woman who wants a child.‚ÄùRed John knew that Patrick would make such a conclusion, and he followed Jane's train of thought, wrote the manager's phone number on the wall at the very beginning, and also reported the details of the child's disappearance and chose an accomplice who would fit the profile that Patrick would inevitably make. Red John made sure that Jane came to exactly the conclusion he was aiming for. He even helped Patrick with his strategy by indirectly showing him two suspects. So Red John instructed the manager to tell Patrick that it was his ex, and then the ex said that it was Sean, and after receiving this information, Patrick used the ex and Sean in his strategy. Thus, Red John anticipated Patrick's entire strategy.
They then conducted a search and found the child in the house. Then the manager returned to the house, where Patrick and Lisbon were waiting for him. She said that she had helped Red John and that if she was caught (which is exactly what Red John wanted from the very beginning), she should give them the CD with the list. She gave it to them, and then, while in a police car, swallowed a pill and committed suicide, as John wanted, in order to erase all traces of her involvement.

Consider Kira Tinsley.
Red John kills Chad Parkman, the coach, and the members of Visualise. Jane and Cho visit the gym where Parkman worked, and Kira Tinsley approaches Cho, mistaking him for a gym employee, and asks about prices. Kira Tinsley was hired by Red John to wiretap the CBI. Kira Tinsley enters the CBI office and asks for Cho. Van Pelt directs her to his desk, and she sets up a listening device under his desk. After that, Kira and Cho go out for coffee together. Jane sees through it and removes the bug from Cho's desk. He then confronts Kira. It turns out that Kira was a private investigator. However, Kira is lying, saying that she works for Visualise. Jane also planted a bug in her bag, tricking her by throwing a coin in her coffee, making her think that he dropped the bug when it was already in her bag. Eventually Jane finds out that Kira was hired not by Visualise, but by Red John. He asks Van Pelt to track her down immediately. At the same time, they listen to her with the help of a bug installed by Jane, and hear someone ringing her doorbell.
It turns out to be Red John. He kills her by stabbing and strangling her, but Kira sees a tattoo on his left arm. When Jane and Lisbon arrive, she is already on her last legs, but she manages to convey to Jane that the perpetrator had a tattoo on his left arm, and he drew three dots on her left arm. Red John planned it all. He hired Kira to bug the CBI, and he knew Jane would figure him out. He predicted that Jane would listen to her in return. He kills Kira when he is sure that Jane already knows that he hired her, and deliberately shows her the tattoo. It was a deliberate oversight. One of the proofs that the mistake was organized by John is:
We know that the fake body was manufactured by Partridge; this was stated by PJ in S6E8. Now the problem is that Partridge died in the 1st episode of season 6. Meanwhile, the meeting between the six takes place in the 6th episode of the 6th season, and the oversight in the 5th episode of the 6th season. So these two events happened two months after Partridge's death, which means that before Partridge's death, that is, two months before the meeting, Rj had already prepared a meeting with Patrick and how Patrick would discover the tattoo.

That evening, Lisbon receives a call telling her about the murder, if I'm not mistaken, but it was John. Arriving, he sees Partridge dying, and finally he says: ""Tiger! Tiger!"" This confirms that he was affiliated with the Blake association, but was just a pawn. It was important that Lisbon find Partridge dead and not just missing, as this was the only way to completely eliminate him from the list of suspects.

As for Kirkland, he kidnapped Patrick because he wanted to know about the list of suspects and who was on it. Kirkland was going to torture him.
Lisbon, knowing that Kirkland had kidnapped Jane, searched all the houses that Kirkland owned and found the one where he could take Patrick.
She went there, arrested Kirkland, and while Kirkland was being driven in a car to the prison, two of John's accomplices were present. They ordered Kirkland to flee, and as soon as Kirkland tried to flee, one of the accomplices shot him. They explained this to the other police officers by saying that he was trying to escape.

Finally meeting with the suspects.
Red John reasoned that when Patrick found out about the ""three dots"", he would automatically schedule a meeting with the remaining suspects.
This seems to be true, considering that a few days after Kira Tinsley was brutally injured, Jane called Thomas to inform him about the meeting. For his plan to work, John had to make sure that the other suspects on the list would also come to the meeting.
Therefore, he decided that the CBI officers would try to track down all five suspects
It wasn't very difficult for Smith. Patrick came to him and asked, and Smith calmly agreed. The same goes for McCallister; John agreed, adding: ""It's because of Red John, isn't it?"" when PJ asked him to come. As for Haffner, Lisbon asked him to come. He didn't want to at first, but Lisbon convinced him. Bertram also agreed when Patrick and Lisbon invited him.
It was much more complicated for Stiles: he had been missing for several weeks, and the FBI was unsuccessfully searching for him. Cho and Rigsby went to interview Stiles' friend, the one who replaced him in Visualize. They asked him where Stiles was, and his friend replied that he didn't know. However, later in the episode, we see Stiles in one place with a woman who tells him, ""Patrick Jane is looking for you."" We can assume that it was Stiles' friend who gave him this message. Also, when Lisbon visited Haffner, she asked him where Stiles was, and Haffner agreed to cooperate. He said he traveled around the country on a private jet to go unnoticed, which belongs to a man named Ryan Parks. 
Then Cho and Rigsby went to the man who oversees the landings of private planes, including Stiles' plane. They asked if he saw someone getting off a private jet (it was a specific plane; Cho and Rigsby managed to gather this information, but the show did not explain how). The man who was watching what was happening replied that he did not remember anyone getting out, but he saw the car that the man got into, and also remembered the make of the car.
Then the dealership said that they had indeed picked up a man similar in description to Stiles, who had gone to a certain place in San Francisco 
Van Pelt then went to the designated location, and Bret Stiles agreed to meet with her because he already knew it was just for Patrick Jane, thanks to the information his friend had given him earlier.
So she asked him to come to the meeting, but Stiles refused.
Then Patrick Jane went to Stiles himself. Patrick explained the situation to Bret Stiles, who seemed convinced, but the problem still remained: if Stiles left the place where he was, the FBI could arrest him, and there were a lot of cars around the house, which was a real problem for Patrick. To solve this problem, Patrick developed a tactic: three men left the house, two of whom were apparently hiding one, and got into a car. The FBI, deciding that the hidden man was Bret Stiles, followed the car. When they stopped it, they saw that it wasn't Stiles, and meanwhile Stiles escaped in a helicopter.
Red John foresaw these events.
After that, Patrick informed all the suspects about the meeting place, which was supposed to take place about 7 hours in advance. In those 7 hours, Rj had already prepared bombs in the house and placed the fake body that Partridge had made 3 months ago in his truck. Later, on the way to the meeting, Patrick stopped to ""admire the sunset."" Then he told Lisbon that she meant a lot to him, and they hugged. During the hug, Jane stole Lisbon's phone. Then he said that he had a surprise for her in his car, and, getting inside, started the engine and drove away. He wanted to get rid of her so he could be alone with the suspects, just like Rj didn't want Lisbon with him because the bombs only covered the positions of 6 people. He had foreseen that Patrick would get rid of her.
Then, during the meeting, Patrick named those who had tattoos, namely Bertram, McCallister and Smith. He asked them to move to another place, and at that moment a non-lethal bomb exploded, stunning everyone in the room. McCallister, who was further away and was prepared, was less affected by the explosion and recovered faster than others. Meanwhile, he moved the bodies of Bertram, Smith and Jane to a safer place and brought the fake body back to the house. He then detonated a second bomb, which proved fatal and killed Stiles and Haffner, while the other three survived. 
Here's everything Rj has arranged for this meeting, which will allow Patrick and his team to narrow down the list to Smith and Bertram.

Now the meeting with Red John.
After that, Lisbon walked up to the house, saw Smith and told him not to move, but Smith tried to run away and she had to shoot him. Smith still managed to escape with a wound, while Bertram remained unnoticed, since Lisbon, unlike Smith, did not see Bertram's tattoo. After that, Patrick stayed in the hospital, and then Bertram came to the hospital to try to kill Patrick. This order was given by John (from Bertram's point of view, he did not know that McCallister was Red John, so he simply followed the instructions without asking questions about his fake death). Lisbon notices Bertram and he leaves when Jane wakes up. Patrick says Bertram has 3 points too, meaning he framed him perfectly. Then we see Smith in the house, where he is being treated by a corrupt doctor. After that, Cordero from the association came and told the corrupt policeman who was guarding the house that the CBI was on its way and that they needed to leave. The policeman and Smith then left the house, but at some point, as they were leaving, the policeman told Smith that he would have to kill him. This was because the CBI was chasing them, and Smith was becoming a burden. Smith knelt down, and at that very moment Rigsby arrived and began to fight with the policeman.  That is, Smith is not Red John, because he was almost killed by an ordinary member of the organization. When the corrupt policeman who had just arrested Rigsby arrived at the CBD, PJ asked him a few questions, and he managed to get the right answers to all the questions by reading his mind. But John knew about Patrick's abilities and did not disclose to the policeman any important information about Red John that Jane did not yet know. Smith later called the CBI and said he wanted to give up because his injury was too serious and, in particular, because the members of the association were hunting him from all sides. Smith told me about Blake's Association and how he got into it. Patrick had only one suspect left, Bertma.

John ordered Bertram to contact Patrick and set up an appointment. He stopped at the grocery store, called Patrick, and before saying that he wanted to meet with him, said what Rj told him to say: ""This time I'm calling you in my normal voice."" Bertram was then about to tell PJ that they needed to meet, but a policeman saw Bertram in the store. The detective accompanying Bertram had to kill him, so they had to adjust and find another place to carry out the plan and summon Patrick. Bertram then found a way to call Jane and tell him more news, following Red John's instructions, which indicated that he himself was Red John. For example, he said something like: ""The game is over, it was an honorable draw"" and ""I could have killed you many times, but I didn't do it."" Patrick agreed to the meeting and offered to go to church, which Bertram accepted. As during the meeting with the five suspects, John prepared the place. This time he had only 30 minutes, so he took a woman with a knife, dressed her as a Christian and instructed her what to do. Bertram and PJ then met at a meeting. Bertram began by saying that he was not Red John and that they had made a mistake. Just when PJ was about to think that the detective accompanying Bertram might kill him, the detective eventually killed Bertram, and the real Red John, McCallister, appeared. His plan was that everyone thinks Bertram is Red John. He wanted to fake it like he and Patrick killed each other.",4,1753857406.0,TheMentalist,0,1.0,False

I am a college aged girl and I am really awful hormonal/period issues. There‚Äôs a lot that goes into it but moral of the story i‚Äôm on a 3-6 month wait list for a obgyn and i‚Äôm looking for tips on what to say/look at when i‚Äôm visiting + what i should have prepared and start tracking right now to have for the appt.Additionally after listing my problems any tips you have would be super appreciated!

Around 4 years ago, my period went from what i would assume is a pretty typical period to hell on earth. I honestly didn‚Äôt even know my period was the problem and the doctors basically nicely told me that they had no idea.
( my period is not consistent but after tracking the issue with a flair i had i was able to figure it out on my own) These ‚Äúflare ups‚Äù consist passing out, nerve pain so bad i cannot stand, pain when you even just touch me lightly in my arms or thighs, migraines so bad i can‚Äôt go to school or even look at a light, etc about a week before my period has  even started. More recently, my periods have been between 9-14 days sometimes coming twice in a month and other times not coming for months at a time. I get cramps all 14 days and most times before my period even starts , even after. The pain is also immense making it hard to do daily activities.Not to mention my last period I fell asleep in a chair at a target because i got tired out of no where. Ovarian cysts and endometriosis are heavy in both sides of my family but no one i‚Äôve talked to has experienced the nerve pain. (side note: i am also not currently sexual active if that helps anyone at all.) 

Enough woe is me. I know this is not normal. I‚Äôve been tracking my cycle with flo and treating pain the best i can but i feel like i am being tortured half of the month and would like it to stop lol. 

The obgyn is also quite scary of an idea for me and i wanna make sure my pain is heard clearly. 

side note: Birth control is an option for me and i know they will suggest it. Any tips for this would be appreciated. I can‚Äôt take a pill because i know for a fact i wont remember to take it.

Any ideas on what to do? Obgyn wise? Helpful healing tips? legit anything would be the best!

*Saint Ann‚Äôs School, Brooklyn, New York City*

*09:00, Saturday 26th of July.*

*Overcast.*

***

‚ÄúWait a minute. This is where you went?‚Äù 

There‚Äôs a large, multi-story structure revealing itself around the corner of a building, and Helena is leading Natasha right to it. It's beautiful, with a marble white facade, multiple windows, and complex decorations all placed before a dramatic, overcast sky. 

They weave past tourists on their mid-morning hunt for the best-rated coffee shops and inauthentic bodegas. Nat tightens her hold on the cross-body bag that contains her meager rations of ambrosia and her disguised sword in case of pickpockets, while Helena hums as she walks, allowing her duffle to flutter easily, half-open. It contains only her tape, ambrosia and nectar supplies, her gauntlet, and a water bottle. She is already wearing her armour and hand-wraps. No reason to worry of pick-pockets when you notice *everything.* Helena wishes a motherfucker would.

‚ÄúWell yeah, of course I went here. What school did you go to?‚Äù 

‚ÄúNo, no, I just mean like. I walked past here so many times thinking it looked like a prison tower. I never really read the sign.‚Äù If anything, it looks more like a historical piece than a place of learning.

Helena holds open the door for Nat, operating as though she owns the place, which is standard for the girl honestly. ‚ÄúI mean, it *is* a tower, so you‚Äôre half-right. About a thousand kids though, K through 12. How‚Äôd you miss ‚Äòem all, Rouge?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶‚Äù Nat looks up as they cross under the huge arch, distracted, before falling back in line next to her friend. ‚ÄúI never paid that much attention. I walked home with my little siblings a lot.‚Äù

Helena shrugs, not really feeling the need to press on the subject more than she already had. ‚ÄúMakes sense. Lucky, would‚Äôve killed to have had siblings growing up.‚Äù She lets the door shut behind them, walking briskly past the lobby as she has done a thousand times, and making for the large stairwell in the back of the room. ‚ÄúFollow me, the satyr is probably going to be where the people are, and most of the summer school classrooms and stuff are on the next two floors.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou went to a school with marble columns and a literal red carpet?‚Äù Nat looks slightly shocked, as if she‚Äôs not ready to let go of the realization that Helena, of all people, comes from a very different tax bracket than her. She hurries to catch up. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt really imagine you here.‚Äù

Helena continues up the steps, though is going slower than she normally would for the sake of Nat. It's a good time to discuss things. ‚ÄúYeah, I guess so. I‚Äôm surprised the satyr is here, honestly. We don‚Äôt have a lotta people.‚Äù Helena snickers at a sudden thought, and bumps her friend's arm lightly before conspiratorially saying, ‚ÄúWho knows, maybe the satyr came looking for me. I *was* here just a few months ago.‚Äù

Natasha grins. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd bet on that, sister. You‚Äôre a catch.‚Äù She hums in thought. ‚ÄúHow do you think we should draw him out to the halls? 

‚ÄúDepends. Most of the classrooms are gonna be unoccupied, but I know they reserve like four or five between these two floors for summer school stuff. The staff and meeting rooms are also on this next floor, so that could be more mortals to sort through.‚Äù Helena stops suddenly, crossing her arms as she thinks. ‚ÄúSome clubs use the rooms through the summer, so we could pretend to be one of those, gives us an excuse to open doors? Say we‚Äôre looking for an empty one if any of them have people in them. Think we smell strong enough for him to notice if we poke our heads into whatever room he‚Äôs in?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a child of Hades,‚Äù Nat says flatly by way of answer, nodding. Helena tries to hide the wrinkle of displeasure that rises in her at the reminder that Nat ‚Äòsmells‚Äô more than her. Helena is powerful, at least as powerful as a Herakles kid can be at her age, right? 

Nat chuckles, hoping to keep the mood upbeat as they near the battle she doesn‚Äôt truly want to be a part of. But someone had to come keep an eye on her reckless friend after the last debacle she‚Äôd heard about. 

‚ÄúWe could wave a sword around through the windows until someone notices.‚Äù She lets sparks spring to her fingertips. ‚ÄúOr flash some fire. That‚Äôll be our guy.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds good to me.‚Äù Helena continues walking, making the effort to play off her annoyance with a small giggle. ‚ÄúHah, you smell.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI smell good. I got this new shampoo, it‚Äôs cherry scented.‚Äù She runs a hand down one long braid as if to show off what can‚Äôt be seen.

Helena rolls her eyes at her friend‚Äôs indignance, but smiles slightly at the preening. How different they are. ‚ÄúGirl, that scented shit messes with your skin oils. Gotta build up a good natural smell, natural soaps.‚Äù 

Nat *hmphs*. ‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll smell like cherries, and you can smell like eucalyptus or whateve‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúBongiorno, Demigoddesses!‚Äù The satyr steps out from behind the corner they had just turned, the guise it had been wearing already falling apart as it drops any pretense of hiding. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Tony! Who‚Äôs ready to hear da good word of Lord Atlas, Titan a‚Äô Endurance?‚Äù

At the mention of Atlas, Natasha forces herself in front of Helena. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not listening to this,‚Äù she says decisively. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not going to work.‚Äù

The satyr continues as though she hadn‚Äôt spoken, determined to get his message out and not willing to let some little girl interrupt him. ‚ÄúI knew I smelled somethin‚Äô strong from dat classroom. Just the kids I was lookin‚Äô for, you know this place reeks of hero godlin‚Äô? One a you I‚Äôm guessin‚Äô?‚Äù

The glimpses the two girls get of the Mist-disguise would remind the both of them of the super-seniors that seem to infest every place of secondary education on the planet. Older than he should be, too much facial hair, lazy as hell looking.

Not to say he looks better as a satyr, mind you. The Aethiopian satyr seems covered in spotty and unkempt body hair, its bare chest shaved in some unintelligible pattern that is clearly meant to be *some* symbol. A faux-gold chain wraps itself around the muscular neck of the monster, the letter ‚ÄòA‚Äô hanging from it. The goat-man‚Äôs pockmarked face is curled up in a slimy smile, revealing his stained and pointed teeth. His matted hair curls around thick and twisted ram‚Äôs horns, much larger and more significant than those of a normal satyr. This is in line with the rest of the monster‚Äôs form, which seems generally more muscular than any goat-men either girl would have seen before.

Overall, from his greasy hair to his chipped and stained hooves, the satyr simply looks gross.

Helena steps around and in front of Nat, her previously giddy expression shifting to a more serious looking one, though no less excited. ‚ÄúThat would be me, goat-man. You want a piece?‚Äù

The carnivore rolls his eyes, pointing one disgusting finger at Nat. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt matter no way, it's her I got a whiff of just now. Dat‚Äôs death god stank, no lie. Strong one. You a Hekate kid, Girly? Melinoe? No way you‚Äôre a Hades, only like a couple of ‚Äòem alive.‚Äù

Nat swallows her fear at being pegged so quickly, hands jolting as if she may need the defense of Hellfire. *Because we should not exist.*

‚ÄúBecause you kill them,‚Äù she breathes out, hate in her throat. She‚Äôs suddenly glad Helena is in front. ‚ÄúYou kill us all.‚Äù And my father takes and takes, but I will not allow it. 

Helena stomps her foot in exasperation, cracking the tile. It draws some mortals to the classroom windows. 

*Don‚Äôt ignore me.*

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt talk to her Fuckstick, you don‚Äôt get to. I‚Äôm your main threat, I‚Äôm who you‚Äôre gonna be fightin‚Äô. You leave her alone.‚Äù Her voice betrays her annoyance, coming out a bit too much like a child throwing a tantrum. Nat throws her a side-eye, but her attention is further drawn to the teenage boy with a phone held out, cautiously slipping outside the door to film whatever it is he‚Äôs seeing through the Mist.

Finally, their antagonist turns his slitted pupils towards Helena, its smile turning to a scowl at the girl‚Äôs intrusion. 

‚ÄúYou. I been smellin‚Äô your lingerin‚Äô scent since I got here, don‚Äôt seem to be nuttin‚Äô impressive. Dionysos? We got one a dose back at Atlas HQ, real freak. Maybe Psyche? Nah, you don‚Äôt seem like a lover.‚Äù 

The monster snaps his fingers, the answer coming to him suddenly. ‚ÄúHerakles! I know dat stank and those broad shoulders.‚Äù

As opposed to Nat, Helena is overjoyed at being recognised by her divine heritage, as demonstrated by her broad smile. 

‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm the Big Man‚Äôs kid! What‚Äôs it to ya, livestock? Want a piece of me?‚Äù

More mortals begin to look out the doors, or through the large windows that separate the hallways and the classrooms. Mostly kids, but one or two teachers are now poking their heads out. Their little spat is starting to gather an audience.

The satyr does not look pleased as he answers the girl, and it is beginning to dawn on him that he is not going to be recruiting anyone today. ‚ÄúYeah, you‚Äôre a hero brat alright. Cocky. Annoying,‚Äù the monster scrapes one hoof across the tile, as though sizing up a charge through the girl. ‚ÄúNot too bright, neider.‚Äù

Helena brings her arms out to her side, still smiling broadly as she keeps her eyes locked with the satyr‚Äôs. ‚ÄúWell then, you‚Äôve got nothing to worry about. Come find out, *bitch*.‚Äù

With one last annoyed huff, the goat man drops his head, roars in challenge, and charges.

‚ÄúNat, mortals.‚Äù Helena is already moving.

She doesn‚Äôt have to be told. ‚ÄúCareful, Helena,‚Äù Nat warns, before slipping away to complete her task. 

It turns out it‚Äôs immediately necessary, as the mortals pile into the hall at the same time that Helena steps forward to meet the charge of the satyr.

With a ***CRACK***, Helena catches the ram horns in her hands, and laughs as the monster continues trying to charge forward, its hooves scraping uselessly on the tile of the hallway.

‚ÄúLet me go Toots, if ya know what's good for ya‚Äôs!‚Äù The satyr‚Äôs voice stinks of Italian mobster energy. It makes Helena smile.

With an uproarious laugh, Helena picks up on the horns slightly, before bringing them down hard and slamming the satyr‚Äôs face into the floor. 

The mortals watch, and so does Nat in horrified fascination, before she resumes her task. ‚Äú¬°Dale! Time to clear out,‚Äù she begins shooing the filming mortals back down the staircase and into the classrooms- anywhere, really. ‚Äú¬°Vamos, vamos!‚Äù But she‚Äôs impatient, and they don‚Äôt listen as fast as they could. Spurts of blackened, rotten flames flash through the air as she runs them off like a destructive herding dog. Though the Mist will work overtime to cover up the far greater danger represented by one Helena Roosevelt in her element, it cannot deny the simple danger of fire.

The monster groans for a second, seemingly dazed by the floor-cracking impact. Helena lets go of the horns, figuring she‚Äôll give her opponent a chance to recover before resuming the assault.

The satyr doesn‚Äôt need one though, and the moment Helena lets go of the horns, while she is still bent down, the horned-head of the monster rises from the floor at speed, slamming into Helena‚Äôs nose.

Familiar pain erupts from Helena‚Äôs face as she is sent stumbling back, holding her bleeding and mutilated nose with one hand. Tears sting her eyes instinctively as she yelps from the shock of the impact, barely catching the faint sound of Nat‚Äôs ‚ÄúHelena!‚Äù thrown over her shoulder in the midst of her own work. It has been a few months since Helena‚Äôs nose was last broken, so she shouldn‚Äôt be surprised. 

*Fun!*

‚ÄúYou got cocky, Girly. My head was made for impacts. Now, If you and your friend will just lay down for tyin‚Äô up so I can take you to Da Boss, dat‚Äôd be great.‚Äù

‚ÄúDude, you have no fuckin‚Äô idea the kind of shit you‚Äôre in.‚Äù Broken and bleeding nose, wide smile revealing bloody teeth, and an exuberant look in her eyes. Helena was made for this.

The carnivorous satyr pauses for a moment, its overly-hairy face twisted in confusion at the unexpected reaction. ‚ÄúI- ...What?‚Äù

Helena gives no more purchase to conversation. Her footstep cracks the floor as she surges towards the goat-man, hands raised in a combative stance. 

Her right fist slams into the satyr‚Äôs jaw with head-whipping force, knocking out one of the monster‚Äôs disgusting teeth, before slamming a left hook into the creature‚Äôs ribs, then ending the combination with an uppercut.


Basic, but effective. The goat man reels back, dazed for the second time by the strength of the girl. Nat has to flatten herself against the wall to avoid him. Helena remains rooted in place, keeping her guard up for the counter she knows is coming.

*Strong. Angry. Horns. Hooves. Teeth.*

She is right to stay ready, as Tony the satyr chooses this moment to charge once again, bellowing in rage and desperation as he hopes to crush her well and good this time.

Helena laughs wildly as she sidesteps the uncoordinated charge, keeping one foot to the side in order to hook the monster in the hoof.

With a surprised bleat, Tony is sent stumbling into the thick glass of the window-wall separating their hallway battleground from a classroom. As his head connects with a mighty ***CLUNK***, the glass threatens to shatter, only just holding firm.

Helena approaches her momentarily downed opponent, laughing loudly at the site of the satyr in full child‚Äôs pose.

*Too close.*

The hoof comes suddenly, the entire lower body of the monster moving faster than she can react.

The foot of the monster connects with a loud popping noise, the sound of both the impact, and Helena‚Äôs breastbone being fractured. The girl flies back, rolling head over heels and crying out in pain. Her Forest Bull armour is the only reason her whole abdomen doesn‚Äôt get caved in by the strength of the blow.

She finally comes to a stop having moved a few feet back from where she had just been standing, clutching her chest and sneering in pain. 

Just in time. The monster is standing now as well, chuckling at the sight of the temporarily downed girl just as she had laughed at him only a moment ago. ‚ÄúSome hero godlin‚Äô. I hope dat hurt, little gi‚Äì‚Äù

With a frenzied yell, Helena flies at the monster, having activated her ‚ÄúMove‚Äù power. The two go flying through the previously cracked window, shattering the glass.

They land in a flurry of human and Caprid limbs, bleats and yells abounding as they wrestle one another for dominance. Helena has her strength and skill, but the monster has his own experience and resources to pull on.

A desperate scream from a young girl, the kind Helena would not normally allow herself to utter, echoes through every hallway and staircase throughout the building. Absolute pain blooms from her unprotected shoulder as the carnivorous monster sinks its fangs deep into the muscle tissue there.

The girl flails wildly in desperation for a second, panic having caused her to forget her better senses for the briefest of moments. This moment ends though, as she slams her fists concurrently into the opposite sides of the satyr‚Äôs skull. Very hard.

Tony disconnects his teeth and throws his head back in a dazed yell, giving Helena enough leverage to shove him up and off of her. 

Tony rises to his feet first, looking down at Helen with none of the slimy charm he had earlier demonstrated. He sees a broken, embattled girl with more wounds than can be counted, lying in a pool of broken glass and blood, which streams from her nose and the bite wound on her shoulder with every pump of her heart.

Nat sees it too, her friend, broken on the ground. It steals her breath from her lungs, though she‚Äôs fine, she‚Äôs just corralling mortals like some second rate demigod-turned-crowd police.

She begins to claw at the zipper to her bag, searching for her sword. Helena needs her help‚Äîanyone else would be done, beaten.

‚ÄúDat was just da start, little girl. I‚Äôm gonna take you apart, morsel by morsel, and den I‚Äôm gonna eat dat little death-runt. Fuck Da Boss, I‚Äôm doin‚Äô diss for Tony!‚Äù

Helena is not anyone else. Already she is preparing herself for the third round, her body readying itself to slip into the altered state that allows her to ignore wounds and pain, and fight at her fullest. She needs only a second to prepare, and she will be back into it. 

But in that second, the satyr‚Äôs shadow on the ground ripples and solidifies, takes form, and out of it rises the daughter of Hades. Nat‚Äôs dark eyes are fixed in concern on Helena, as if the satyr‚Äôs danger was an afterthought when she chose her shadow traveling destination. She wants this to stop, wants to buy enough time that they can both get out of here. She would rather take her place as a human shield than leave the school alone. 

Helena‚Äôs heart rises in her throat as her friend materialises, and she mouths for Nat to leave without hesitation. She doesn‚Äôt want her here, doesn‚Äôt need her help, and she is just going to get hurt.

The satyr though, he is having none of it. He bellows in anger at the daughter of Hades, before charging at her with murderous intent. Helena screams out for her to move, desperately wishing her friend had just stayed back.

Just slightly too late, Nat remembers the combat skills she has long since left to decay at the wayside. Her sword is palmed comfortably in her palm, and she rises from her crouch and rounds on the beast with a viciously sharp slash. If she was in better practice, she might have met her actual target, might have cut its throat and ended it. Instead, her sword catches in its horn. 

The monster cries out in rage and pain, though its purpose is unchanged. Its open hand slams into Nat‚Äôs neck, lifting her off the ground and beginning to squeeze, its bloodshot eyes boring into the girl‚Äôs panicked ones.

‚ÄúYou think dat can stop me? Your friend is strong enough to squash you, and I put her on da floor! Maybe I was wrong, maybe you weren‚Äôt da more powerful one of you two broads. Still, eating a Hades brat is gonna give me some major clout! So ya know, tanks toots!‚Äù

She can‚Äôt breathe. She can‚Äôt get enough leverage to rip her sword out from where it‚Äôs stuck. Nat‚Äôs world has suddenly narrowed to silent whimpers and squeaks that might have been attempted breaths or just cries, to clawing and flailing with her off hand as she fails to muscle the sword into her control with the other. 

Finally, her desperation brings forth more Hellfire. She pounds on the satyr‚Äôs arm as the world paints itself black and gray. Her vision dims, momentarily flickers with bright, colorless sparks, and darkens once more. The flames from her fingertips may be weak from her lack of focus, but Hellfire is wild, and it‚Äôs made to burn flesh more than kindling. 

The satyr‚Äôs hold loosens, his face screwed up in pain as he desperately flails to put out the fire. Nat has just enough leeway to break free with one last wrench at the sword, causing the satyr to once again screech in pain.

It splinters the material of the horn, which pops free and is sailing through the air by the time Natasha hits the ground in a heap. The satyr pats his arm once more, putting out the last holdouts of hellfire, before looking down on the demigod with unbridled malice splayed-out on its bruised and burnt face. She tries to push herself away amidst miserably pained coughs.

‚Äú*Youuuuuuuu! I‚Äôm gonna tear you apart!*‚Äù The monster takes one shuttering step forward, anger positively rippling out of every movement.

***WHAM***

The daughter of Herakles‚Äô foot slams into the knee of the satyr, shattering the leg of the monster and sending him crumpling to the ground with a ragged scream.

WIthout missing a beat, Helena slams a fist into the unprotected face of her downed opponent, having lost all sense of whimsy. As much as she is still enjoying this, her smile has been all but wiped away. She is here to end this.

Tony tries in vain to batter Helena off of him, but her strength is absolute, and he is much too spent. She wrenches his arm down to his sides, planting one powerful knee in the center of the creature‚Äôs chest to hold him down.

Finally, after a few seconds of struggle, Helena has both arms pinned, and one hand still free to finish the job. The creature bites and snarls at Helena, his pain and anger having reduced him to little more than a beast to be put down. Anyone but Helena might find it sad.

***SLAM***

‚ÄúThreaten *my* friend?‚Äù

***SLAM***

‚ÄúCome to *my* school?‚Äù

***SLAM***

‚ÄúIgnore *me*?

***SLAM***

That final punch seals it, shattering the satyr‚Äôs unbelievably durable skull once and for all, and beginning the quick process of the monster dissolving into dust. Nat watches the carnage, dumbstruck.

For once, Helena does not look content after a fight. She stands up quickly, firing an angry look at Nat, before bending down, grabbing the horn, and marching out into the hallway. 

‚ÄúHelena.‚Äù Her voice is still wrecked, and she has to clear her throat roughly. ‚ÄúHel*ena*!‚Äù Nat calls after sharply, pushing herself to her own feet. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt just‚Äî walk away.‚Äù She hurries to catch up, frustration rising when Helena simply continues. 

Finally, Helena answers in a sharp, snappy tone, and doesn‚Äôt bother to look at the girl as she says, ‚ÄúWhat, Nat?‚Äù

Nat grabs her unwounded shoulder, startling when Helena rounds on her. ‚ÄúThat was reckless,‚Äù she seethes. ‚ÄúIt was- it was excessive.‚Äù 


Helena crosses her arms, examining her friend with thinly-veiled frustration. ‚ÄúI had it under control. The only reckless thing was you putting yourself in-between me and the Goat.‚Äù

‚ÄúOnly because you wouldn‚Äôt stop, or, or be even a *little* cautious with yourself!‚Äù

‚ÄúOh yeah, cause you were *soooo* cautious when you tried to step to a guy who could rip you in half without breaking a sweat. Give me a break, Nat.‚Äù Her voice is surprisingly neutral, as are her expressions. She‚Äôs keeping a tight lid.

Helena turns and resumes walking, beginning their descent down the stairs. Nat throws her hands up, forced to follow. ‚ÄúI was here for you! To help *you*. Will you at least- slow *down*?‚Äù She still doesn‚Äôt feel like she‚Äôs fully caught her breath since the satyr‚Äôs chokehold, and Helena looks, well, much worse.  

Helena stops once again, steadying her rising breathing as best as she can. Without turning around, she simply says, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt ask for you to come. I didn‚Äôt ask for you to butt-in on *my* fight. So, stop yelling at me, let's get out of here before the mortals call the cops about that property damage, and I‚Äôll let you look at my wounds or whatever all you want. Unlike you, I don‚Äôt *get* to blow up and get mad.‚Äù Then, she begins walking again, feeling like her point has been made.

Nat opens her mouth for some half-baked protest, but Helena is right about the cops. Only when they make it to the open air and around the corner does she bite out, brows knotting together as she pulls out the small bit of ambrosia from her pack, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not for you to say. I see you in the med cabin each and every time, and I do not want to see that. You get one body. One life.‚Äù 

With more anger than she intends, Helena begins to argue against Nat, though stifles her tone quickly. ‚ÄúHow does that‚Äì How does that square? Girl, I have my body *because* I do shit like this. I win, and I keep winning, and I keep fighting. What‚Äôs wrong with that?‚Äù She bites through the ambrosia Nat places in her hand quickly, taking no time to savour the nostalgia it brings with it through the taste of her Mom‚Äôs awful brownies.

Nat nibbles resentfully on a bit herself, but even just standing here in the shade of the alleyway is making her throat feel better. She stops to respond. 

‚ÄúBecause someday you‚Äôll lose! If someone like me isn‚Äôt here in time.‚Äù

Helena looks at her friend pointedly, her blue eyes drilling into Nat‚Äôs. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you ever say that again. Not about me. Ever.‚Äù

Natasha can‚Äôt help her skeptic disbelief, but this is a losing battle and she‚Äôs out of steam. ‚ÄúJust- shut up and let me do my work.‚Äù 

She lifts her hands, trying to ascertain the first point of business, probing at each separate injury‚Äînose, shoulder wound, sternum‚Äîgently, grimly. There‚Äôs half-hearted bickering between the two, but they‚Äôve done this many times before at camp. 

‚ÄúI only have the ambrosia,‚Äù she says finally. 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fine, we can use my tape and gauze to close the wounds while we get to my place. It's a few neighborhoods from here, but there‚Äôs medical supplies there. My mom is kind of used to this by now.‚Äù She smiles as she says this, thinking of home. 

‚ÄúMine is a few blocks that way,‚Äù Nat offers with a thumb pointed behind her. She almost feels bad for suggesting anything different at the sight of Helena‚Äôs smile.  

Helena shrugs and answers, ‚ÄúOkay, that works,‚Äù before standing and stretching out a bit. She‚Äôs still angry, but it could be cool to see her friend‚Äôs place. Even if she is mad at her.

A little thrum of excitement flits through Nat‚Äôs stomach, though the feeling comes with nerves as well. Helena‚Äôs place is nicer, surely, but since Nat realized where they were, she‚Äôs been thinking about her own home. ‚ÄúOkay. Cool. It‚Äôs been‚Ä¶ a while, but we always had first-aid stuff. And my siblings might be there,‚Äù she says, as if in peace offering. 

‚ÄúOkay then, let‚Äôs go.‚Äù

Standard Thursday night, right? Anyway, picture this: I'm lazily going through profiles when‚ÄîBAM!‚Äîup pops someone I totally recognize. And not just a 'hey, I've seen them at the coffee shop' kind of recognize. No, this was my coworker from down the hall who's in all those 'optional but rcommended' meetings.

Cue sheer paanic mix with a dose of comedy becasue I hadn't planned for this scenario. Do I swioe left politley and carry on? Swipe right as a joke? Sooiler: I panicked and swiped right. Next thing I know, we're a match and I‚Äôm internally screaming ‚Äòcause like, what now?

Long story short, instead of it being awkward af, we ended up chatting and discovered we both love the same podcasts and have almost identical taste in overpriced lucnh spots. Fast forward a few weeks, and we‚Äôre more friends than colleagues now, traing memes and occasionally venting about work over coffee breaks.

I gues it‚Äôs true when they say 'expeect the unexpected' with online dating. Who knew my work buddy and I would turn into lunch buddies thanks to a random swipe? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è If nothing else, I‚Äôve got a solid story to tell at work parties now! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",10,1753856603.0,OnlineDatingStory,0,1.0,False

I am trying to figure out what is preventing me from finding someone even for a short, casual fling because I genuinely don't know anymore. 

Background: I've dated both men and women I've met from the apps for around 8 years. I will go on several dates for a few months, get tired, take a few months break, and then get back into it. I'm very open to meeting just about anyone, but I rarely make it to a 3rd date. 

* I've tried taking things extremely slow and sussing someone out, being very cheerful, flirty, and open, talking to someone with the express mutual goal of sex, and everything in between.
* been to dates at coffee shops, activities, street fests, the movies, clubs. I flirt with people from other departments at work. I've even let my parents suggest guys to me through family connections (if you're brown, then I'm talking about biodatas). Every time I meet up with friends or go to a social event, everyone there seems to already be dating or married, so there's just no prospects. My close friends know no single people (not hyperbole). 
* Dating as an adult in the suburbs sucks bc it's a constant back and forth of schedules and work and prior commitments. I moved to a college town last year and I still can't seem to find anyone who can go on a date within 72 hours of us matching on an app. I've gone on a second date 3 weeks after the first bc I'm willing to accommodate a schedule if I feel I like the other person. 

There have been 2 times in the past year I've felt a real connection to someone and that they liked me back. The first was a woman who told me she went exclusive with someone else shortly after we hooked up. The second was a man who told me he felt I was too traditionally Indian and he wanted a life with someone who was very culturally liberally American. This was after a 6 hour date and him asking if I could stay out even later when I said I had to get home at midnight after we went dancing at a club. 

I'm exhausted and lonely. I'm tired of people looking at me with pity and telling me ""it'll happen soon"" and ""your someone is out there."" My younger sister is getting married next year, she's 5 years younger than me, and while I don't care what people think of me, I don't need them saying these things straight to my face. I genuinely don't understand how some people enter relationships so easily but I can't find someone to date even for a few months. ",1,1753856575.0,AskWomenOver30,4,0.57,False
