if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

A few people have warned me it’s going to be really cold that time of year. For anyone who’s been around that time — what do you usually wear for a day of hiking? I’d rather be over-prepared than under-prepared, but I’m hoping to avoid packing our big bulky winter jackets if they’re not totally necessary.

We’re also bringing our 4-year-old golden retriever, so if anyone has dog-friendly trail recs, I’d love to hear them!

I am looking for a good machine but I can’t decide between these 3 (Sage Impress/Express is still an option if you can convince me, but the least likely of the three).

I’m single and live on myself. I drink mostly espressos/lungos, and on a rare occassion I drink a cappucino/flat white. I have an Aerocinno 4 so a milk frothing option is not a must (unless the machines do it better). I am currently on Nespresso but I’m really fed up that taste, it just doesn’t hit the spot. I tried a classick Quick Mill 820 but that was too much hassle. When people come over I don’t want to spend too much time on making them coffee.

Quality of the coffee is most important. Convenience comes second. Is the Sage really worth it? I just need a very good espresso, not the perfect one. And do you guys recommend the Sage with the auto-tamper function?

Price is not an issue, I just don’t need a Jura Z10. Just a good machine that suits my needs. I live in The Netherlands.

The Nivona wasn’t really on my list, but there is a really good offer (800 euros). I think Nivona machines look nicer than the plasticcy Jura’s and I heard they are more convenient. But yeah, on the on the other hand, Jura is Jura.

Advice is really welcome, thanks in advance!!

*…Squeeeeeeeeeeeeeeak\~!*

Muffin Knight was rudely awakened by the tell-tale creak of a door announcing the fact that someone was trying to open it quietly, and the harsh glare of the living room’s light suddenly filtering through her drapes and making her scowl. 

“Read the *signs,* for *fuck’s sake!”* she shouted hoarsely, sending a pillow flying in the general direction of her door. She couldn’t tell if she’d hit or not, but the hissed curse followed immediately by a whispered ‘sorry’ and the equally-loud creak of her door closing again told her that the message had at least gotten through. 

With a grunt and a grumble, Muffin rolled over, glaring evilly at the clock at her bedside that had the audacity to report the time of 6:46 in the morning, and tried to close her eyes to get back to sleep just as the shower in the bathroom beside her bedroom sputtered to life. She groaned again, reaching behind her for her other pillow to cover her ears with, but was immediately reminded that she’d just launched it clear across her bedroom in a fit of sleep-roused rage.

*…fuck… I guess I’m fuckin’ up now…*

Whoever had roused her in search of the bathroom at least had the good sense to be quick and make tracks about it, as in the time it took for Muffin to slowly flop-roll her way off her bed, pull on just enough clothes to qualify as an outfit if you squinted, and clip in her ponytail extension for the day, they had already finished showering. Muffin just barely had time to overhear some muffled, hasty, and seemingly reluctant conversation coming from the living room before the front door opened and shut, and she finally worked up the will to emerge from her room. 

The living room, which her bedroom door opened directly into, was a mess. Pillows and loose clothes, some of which unfamiliar enough to apparently have belonged to the early-morning escapee and left behind in their rush, littered the carpeted floor underfoot. Her green eyes dragged lazily over the half-naked figure sprawled out across the messy couch island, up and across the coffee table with used but empty cocktail glasses sitting coasterless and heavily-condensating, and finally landing on a heavily-freckled face staring back at her with an amused expression from the open-fronted kitchen. 

“Morning, dude,” April Cloverleigh snorted, approaching to lick her thumb and push down a cowlick that was sticking up from Muffin’s bedhead, “Who needs alarm clocks, huh?”

Muffin took a moment to blink some of the sleepy blear out of her eyes, scanning over her roommate slowly, something starting to dully nag in her mind. It took her a lot longer to pin it down today, but in fairness, she wasn’t exactly operating at one hundred percent.

“Teal eyes today?” she asked, raising an eyebrow at April.

“I’m experimenting. Do you think they work?” the freckled girl nodded, leaning and fluttering her eyelashes to accentuate her now sky-coloured eyes. 

“...mmm… maybe not this with this hair colour,” Muffin shook her head slowly with a smile, reaching up to brush a tuft of unwashed hair out of her eyes. April just hummed in thought and blinked her eyes, visibly flirting with the idea of heterochromia for the day, before finally settling on her usual violet gaze. Letting out a little hum of resolved satisfaction, April smiled and held out her arms to the brunette in an offer of embrace.

Muffin just let out a long, suffering groan and buried her forehead lazily in the freckled girl’s shoulder, “...they never read the signs… why did we bother making the signs if they never read the signs…?”

“To be fair, it *is* dark in here when you’re trying to sneak out unnoticed,” April hummed, casting an amused glance at the oh-so-very-clear *‘Hookups:* ***This*** *one’s the shower bathroom’* sign taped on the door just beside Muffin’s bedroom. Muffin just sighed, smacked her lips at her morning breath, and cast a slightly-more-awake glance back out at the scene that was the living room. 

“Another runner, huh,” Muffin sighed, shaking her head at the gently-breathing form on the couch, shoulders slowly beginning to stir.

“Yup,” April nodded, striding over and stepping over a discarded set of boxers to adjust the blanketing over the sleeping girl’s shoulders, “Tried very hard to skedaddle before anybody was awake. I was halfway through breakfast, I caught his ass on the way out the door.”

Muffin blinked blearily, wiping the sleep from her eyes to finally focus. April was dressed up for the day, much in contrast to her own still-groggy half-attire. Not only that, her makeup was already pristine, and her long hair was fixed up to perfection already. 

“Never mind me, what are *you* doing up so early?” she asked, stepping into the kitchen and flipping the switch to boil the coffee machine, “You look halfway out the door yourself.”

“I’m meeting Wuxy,” April sighed, clearly a little sleep-deprived herself, folding her arms, “She woke me up three hours ago with a call, apparently she booked me a *very* time-sensitive gig. I know today was supposed to be a lie-in day for us, but…”

“Plenty of time to watch bad movies some other day,” Muffin shook her head and bumped the freckled girl’s shoulder with her own, earning her a smile and a peck on the cheek that finally started to wake her up a bit. As the coffee machine boiling started to audibly hiss, the figure on the couch finally stirred, and a frizzy, messy flop of auburn hair peeked groggily up over the back of the couch at the pair. 

“Rise and shine,” Muffin chuckled dryly as Roxy Rook’s bleary golden eyes glanced tiredly around the room, unphasedly taking in the sight of the mess she’d clearly left behind the night prior.

“...mmmgh… morning…” Roxy’s sleep-growly voice reverberated lowly, “...mmmph… where’s…?”

“He had to dash,” April responded breezily, before casting a surreptitiously derisive glance at Muffin, who returned it with a sardonic scoff and a roll of her eyes. Oblivious, Roxy just shrugged, stepping groggily off the couch and stretching with an obnoxious yawn, either unaware or uncaring of her sudden stark nudity. Muffin and April shared *another* dry glance at that, but said nothing as their friend plucked up a shirt from the ground with her foot. Roxy sniffed it once, grimaced slightly, then sniffed it again, shrugged, and pulled it on over her head inside-out. 

“Did you guys get a chance to meet him?” she asked at last, striding over to join the pair at the kitchen island, leaning on the counter leisurely, “I wanted to have a chance to introduce you, but we got sidetracked last night, and I guess something came up this morning… his name’s–”

“Not important enough to remember yet,” Muffin cut in abruptly, pouring herself a tall mug’s worth of coffee and throwing it back black, “...ugh… mmf, well, Rox, I mean, we’ve met a *lot* of guys in the past little while. Kinda gets hard to keep track, y’know?”

“We’d be *delighted* to meet your partner once they, erm…” April began, clearly flinching as she searched for gentler words, “...better establish themselves in your life?”

Roxy just blinked at that.

“...once they last a little more than three weeks,” Muffin smiled flatly, to which April just rolled her head back in defeat and grunted her affirmation.

Roxy smiled at that, but it didn’t reach her eyes, and her gaze flickered off to the side for just a moment as the corners of her mouth drooped. She was quick to realize, however, that both of the other girls had immediately noticed this, and even quicker to redirect into swiping the coffee jug out of Muffin’s hands and taking a swig straight from the spout.

“So!” She exclaimed, “Lazy day for you both today, yeah? Wanna hit the couch? Play something, watch something, order out? I think there were some coupon books that showed up in the mail a few weeks ago…”

“Actually…” April winced, running an arm under her bouncy duotone hair for emphasis, “Gonna have to rain check, dude. I gotta head out for the day.”

Roxy visibly deflated at that, “Aw, what? But I thought you didn’t have to go anywhere until Wednesday!”

“Last-minute call,” The ginger shrugged, “And besides, after all the beating-feet my agent does to get me stuff like this, I can’t say no.”

“What’s the gig, anyway?” Muffin inquired, reclaiming the coffee jug from Roxy to start preparing another mug for April, “This some early movie shoot that needs hot extras or something?”

“Nah, it’s a model shoot. New designer bikini line or something, hence why *this…”* April held up a small strawberry yogurt cup for emphasis, “...is the extent of my brekkie for the day. The price we pay for beauty, ladies.”

Roxy, whose lower lip had been puffed out and pouting, suddenly perked up, “Oh, that’s… cool! Are you gonna get to keep the pictures?”

April’s eyes sparkled, and she stifled a snort behind her hand, “Ha, I can probably get some raw copies to take home, but obviously they’re gonna be edited and filtered to hell in the magazine or adverts or whatever they get used in. Of course, if you wanna see me in something skimpy *that* bad, you could just come along and model *with* me, you know.”

Muffin’s eyebrows lilted in amusement as Roxy’s expression somehow morphed into an equal-parts mix of fluster and dread, as the auburnette quickly held her hands up in defence, “O-oh, no thanks! I think, uhm… I think there’s some, uh… stuff I need to… do?”

Roxy’s eyes flitted to Muffin, wide and cloying, to which she just cocked a brow and smirked.

“Yeah, she needs to find the bottom of her Shorts feed,” Muffin nodded along sardonically, “She’s been searching for it for over a year now, remember?”

Roxy’s shoulders deflated, her expression flattened, and she made a noise not altogether unlike a squeaky toy bitten by a dog. 

“Come on, dude, it might be fun!” April implored, grabbing the auburnette by the wrist and getting her smiling face a touch too close to hers, “It’ll be a chill shoot, trust me, I’ve worked with this company before. I have a lot of connections you could meet, and maybe you might even enjoy it!”

“A-ah… well, I… er…” Roxy stammered, recoiling from April’s insistent proximity with a dusting of terrified red on her cheeks, “I’d… I’d love, erm… but, uh… hey, hey! Look at this mess! All over the floor! I can’t just leave all this like this, that would be, uh… disrespectful! To you! So I can’t! E-er… right…?”

April’s formerly enthusiastic expression flattened out into a dull, withering stare, her grip on Roxy’s wrist unflinching even as the other girl seemed to wilt under her violet glare. Muffin, on the other hand, idly preparing the coffee in her hands to what she knew was April’s preference, suddenly perked up. 

“Wait, today’s Saturday, right?” she asked, spinning on her heel and drawing both of her roommates’ eyes to her, “Saturday the first?”

“Uh… yes?” April blinked, “But what– oh. Ohhhh, no. No, no, no, gods damn it, the fucking–”

“-Landlord is coming\~!” Roxy exclaimed in sudden delight, springing free of April’s death grip and just about twirling on her tippy toes, “The first Saturday of the month! The landlord comes by to check up every first Saturday of the month! And there’s *so much* cleaning to do, Muffin can’t *possibly* do this all by herself!”

Roxy continued to spew out excited nonsense as she fled from the room on lightened feet, beginning to pluck up her own discarded clothes from around the couch in the living room and quickly scarpering out of view. April sighed and shook her head, massaging the ridge of her nose and leaning back against the kitchen island, head low. 

“Oh the bright side,” Muffin noted with a soft smile, sidling up beside her partner and bumping their hips together affectionately, “I’ve never seen her this excited about cleaning.”

“...you could absolutely do the cleaning yourself, though,” April grunted, “And she knows this.”

“Yup. I sure could, and she sure does.”

April just sighed again, and Muffin took the lull as a chance to finally slide her coffee into her hands. The freckled girl glanced down at it, practically white from cream and oversweetened to shit, just how she liked it. Her disgruntled moue pulled into a soft smile, and she took an appreciative sip while returning Muffin’s hip bump with one of her own. 

“Besides, can you imagine her in *your* industry?” The brunette couldn’t resist the chance to crack, “There would be a fresh wheedly-voiced white guy lamenting their breakups every *month,* and *fuck* knows the Tangle doesn’t need any more of *that* shit.”

April’s second sip of her coffee spluttered into a laugh, “Oh, be nice to the wheedly-voiced men of the music industry. Some of those songs are about *me,* by the way, and I’m *pretty* sure you must have at *least* one.”

“Indeed,” Muffin nodded solemnly, “‘twas a dig at all of our expenses. I’m an artist.”

“Scattershot isn’t like you. Your attacks are normally so much more bespoke.”

“It’s seven in the fucking morning, and for *whatever* reason, I seem to be awake. I’m off my game, cut me some slack.”

April laughed again, and Muffin smiled softly at the sound, tilting her head to the side to allow the ginger to plant her cheek affectionately against her shoulder. The pair were silent for a short while, but their moment was cut off by the straining sound of their shower sputtering to life again in the next room. So much for cleaning, it seemed. 

“I am going to work that bitch to the bone,” Muffin said through a gritted, twitchy smirk.

“You better,” April nodded, finally pushing herself up off the island and plucking her purse from a nearby chair, “I gotta go. Make sure you bring up the west wall in my room when the landlord comes by, yeah? Thing’s been flickering in and out of space for days, and the raw vacuum of the void makes me break out.”

Muffin grimaced softly, “Right… you know he doesn’t really like me as much as you, right?”

“Doesn’t everyone?” April teased, wiggling her eyebrows, before leaning in to plant a goodbye peck on Muffin’s lips, “See you when I get back, shouldn’t be later than five-ish. We need anything I can pick up on the way home?”

“Not pressingly, but do get pizza,” the brunette smirked, “By the time you get home, I’ll make sure Rox has *earned* it.”

“What a very threatening way to spoil someone,” April rolled her eyes, practically gliding away and out the door, “Peace out, homes.”

Muffin just returned a nonchalant peace sign, watching as the freckled girl stepped out into the Terminus that lay just beyond their front step and out beyond into the Tangle. A small pang in her chest told her that her wanderlust must be acting up; thinking about it, it *had* been a little while since the last time she’d had an adventure of her own. 

With a sigh and a rub to her heavy eyelids, Muffin shook her head to clear it. She kicked off the island and felt her lips tug into a tight smirk, hearing the sound of the steamy shower still running through the wall. 

She probably still had something like forty-five minutes until the auburnette was finally done in there. And she couldn’t help but wonder what sorts of messes she could make in that time. 

\~

In the end, it was actually damn near seven in the evening before April’s high-soled boots finally once again set down on the apartment’s front step. She sighed, running a hand over her face and feeling her makeup beginning to slough off after the long day of posing under glaring fluorescents. It wasn’t a problem of her talent, she’d managed to satisfy every fresh direction and pose on the first or second try; rather the opposite, in fact, the designer on set had appreciated her *so* much that he’d managed to squeeze another entire catalogue’s worth of shooting into the 10-hour shift maximum her union allotted her. It was good money, and she was happy enough to do it in the moment, but now that she was finally home and the aches and complaints from her stiff joints were finally starting to catch up with her, she found herself cursing her own inability to say no. 

The door didn’t squeak when she opened it this time. Her eyebrow twitched at the realization, stepping through into the entranceway. 

“Holy,” April remarked aloud, face squinting up at the sudden scent of cleaning product emanating throughout the entire apartment, “It smells like somebody cleaned up a *crime scene* in here.”

“Hey!” Muffin’s voice from the living room drew her attention, and she turned to find the brunette curled up in the corner of the couch island, Scribe journal open in her cross-legged lap and pen in hand, scribbling idly. Roxy was there too, but instead sprawled out like a dead body, face-down and firmly planted in a well-defined sofa crease. The sight of the open pizza box on the couch beside them both brought with it the sudden, urgent reminder that April had only eaten a single yogurt cup all day, and she quickly tossed her purse aside and joined her friends, thankful for the chance to take her weight off her legs at last. 

“Shit, I *totally* forgot you told me to get some,” April sighed, leaning back and just about melting into the back of the couch as Muffin scooched over to lean up against her, “Sorry I’m late, crazy day…”

“It’s alright,” Muffin laughed, “We had some *very* fun one-on-one time, didn’t we, Roxy\~?”

The only reply from the apparently-conscious Roxy to that was a long, tormented groan, muffled into the plush cushioning beneath her where her face remained planted. Muffin responded by reaching over to plant a self-satisfied and unmistakably patronizing pat on her back, which prompted Roxy to at last flop over onto her back and stare dead-eyed up at the ceiling. 

“...She made me wash the walls… all of them…” she groaned dully, lips forming into a pout and staring pleadingly up at April.

“I didn’t ‘make you’ do *anything,*” Muffin cracked a smirk, “As I recall, you were *so* worried about this place being unkept when the landlord came by that you *very graciously* volunteered your time to getting it clean. *Riiiiiight?”*

Roxy just let out a doglike whine at that. It was always rather unclear to what extent she was just playing this sort of thing up to look cute intentionally, but that uncertainty didn’t stop April from laughing affectionately and stroking a few strands of messy hair out of Roxy’s face, a gesture that the auburnette took immediately as a cue to roll over and rest her head eagerly in April’s lap to be petted. 

“Thanks, dudes,” April smiled, retrieving a slice of pizza with her free hand and finally setting to silencing her growling stomach, “Mmmpfhh… *diff I mish anhyfingh elsh*?”

“Not really,” Muffin giggled at the ginger’s full-mouthed slurring, “Just cleaned up, landlord got the laws of reality patched up and working again… then you were late, so we just ordered the ‘za ourselves early… oh, and that guy from this morning cancelled he and Roxy’s next date, soooo…”

“...ah,” April sighed, glancing down at the auburnette in her lap, whose face had gone distant. She paused in her idle stroking to give an affirming squeeze to her shoulder, before turning back to Muffin. 

“Today was pretty nuts for me…” she began, reaching into her pocket with a soft smile, “...but there is *one* thing that I didn’t forget to bring home…”

Roxy’s eyes shot open all of a sudden as April extracted a small handful of photographs from her jeans. Her arm shot out, grasping and eager, but April was quicker, her arm suddenly stretching upwards towards the ceiling and taking the photos out of reach. 

“Aw, come on!” Roxy exclaimed, hand still outstretched towards the sky in a feeble attempt at snagging them out of April’s grasp, “Lemme see, lemme see! It’s the pics from your shoot, right? The bikinis one? Come on, I wanna see!”

“Well, that’s gross,” Muffin scowled up at the sight of April’s elongated arm, before shaking her head with a wry chuckle, “If it helps, I would say she’s earned it, today. I even managed to get her to scrub out the shower, I think she can have a few thirst traps as a treat, no?”

April’s eyes twinkled mischievously at that, “Are you sure you don’t just wanna see them too, Muff\~?”

Muffin met her gaze with a wink and a sly smile, “Who’s to say? Don’t you trust me?”

“Only about as far as I can throw you.”

“I bet you could throw me pretty far, actually.”

“Yeah, I bet you’d like me to, wouldn’t you?”

“I’ve already lost track of what this innuendo is supposed to mean.”

“I don’t think it was ever actually supposed to mean anything to begin with. Do you wanna see my tits in skimpy bikinis, or not?”

“It legitimately offends me that you feel the need to ask.”

“Would you two stop *flirting* already!?” Roxy groaned, suddenly reminding the other two of her presence and clearly not having stopped trying to reach the photos the entire time. The girls shared a smile and a wink, before April finally gave in, spreading the collection out in front of her and allowing the others to both sidle up beside her.

After about 20 minutes of picking through some favourites had been chosen and flirtily autographed and given away, April unable to resist the chance to tease as Muffin slowly and theatrically slid a particularly close-up bust shot into her pocket. Roxy seemed to have perked up as well, her eyes now shining with contentment, but she didn’t budge from her comfortable place on April’s lap. 

“You guys wanna watch something?” Muffin broke the cozy silence, leaning back against April’s shoulder with her scribe notebook in her lap, “We’d have to go into my room, but…”

“Mmph,” Roxy huffed nonverbally, but her reluctance to move was made clear by the way she wrapped her arms around April’s hips and nuzzled more insistently into her lap, making the ginger girl giggle.

“It’s fine, we can use my laptop,” April laughed, and gestured to Muffin to retrieve her bag. The brunette waved her hand idly, clearly not really wanting to stir either, and the chair that April had deposited her bag onto earlier slid across the carpet to get within arm’s reach. She plucked her laptop from the top zipper and turned it on, setting it a few feet in front of herself.

Roxy, in the end, won the habitual rock-paper-scissors battle to decide who got to choose the evening’s entertainment, which made it only more ironically entertaining when she started snoring only fifteen minutes into Nobody 2. The other two girls exchanged an affectionate, if exasperated, glance, and Muffin reached over to close out of the movie and shut the laptop down with her toes.

“You’re getting bored again, aren’t you?” April asked, politely. There was no accusation in her voice, just the kind curiosity of someone who knew another all too well.

Muffin seemed to take a moment to consider, staring off into space, before responding, “...less so bored than antsy. It’s been a while since I had myself a good adventure.”

“Seven months, now, is it?” the freckled girl asked, “Are you running low on stories?”

“No,” Muffin shook her head, “I’m pretty well-stocked, still… my last outing was in a world with a really fast relative time stream, I managed to live about twenty years there while only being gone here for a couple weeks.”

April cracked a wry smile, “You know it’s *such* bullshit that you still call yourself in your twenties, right? Experientially, what are you, now? In your triple digits yet?”

“Hey, my aging is tied to *your* time stream, remember,” Muffin shot back, “I only age as fast as you do, that was a *bitch* to set up.”

“Yeah, yeah…” 

A blanket of stillness fell over the world again, each of the girls still awake just feeling their eyelids grow heavy as they listened to the other two breathe. Muffin gently set her book aside and turned to her side, leaning her head on her partner’s shoulder and meeting her gaze again.

“However long you’re gone for, just be back on time, yeah?” April finally said, leaning up to press a kiss into Muffin’s hair, “You are *not* leaving me with this one to take care of all by myself.”

“Oh, you like taking care of her,” Muffin shot back.

“You have *both* stockholmed me into enjoying taking care of you. *Somebody* around here has to have their shit together.”

“Some more bold than me would call you whipped.”

“Say that again with that look in your eyes, and I’ll *show* you which one of us is *whipped,* babygirl.”

Muffin made a coy meowing noise in response to that, and just nuzzled herself further into April’s shoulder, her eyes slowly drifting shut. As April quickly came to realize that she was suddenly not only the only one awake, but also the apparent pillow for both of her friends and partners, she simply sighed and resigned herself to her fate. She leaned back, one arm around Muffin and the other slowly petting Roxy’s sleeping form on her lap, and she finally gave into the fatigue in her mind.

Muffin dreamed of adventure. Roxy dreamed of connection. And April dreamed of nothing more than them.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1ololb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/1ololb1/help_suggestions_for_books_that_encapsulate_sonder/,"Help- Suggestions for books that encapsulate ""Sonder""?","Hello all, I'd like to begin with a brief introduction, and I love you. 

My name is Sarge. I am a 20 year old poet and artist, and this summer I was one of only 11 kids accepted into the Youth Documentary Academy, or YDA, in my town. It's an 8k scholarship I was awarded, and with it, I got to make my first short film this year. Filmmaking is my dream.

My world premiere to hundreds of people comes up in a little over a week. But I want your help.

I am making a media pairing for my film. I've begun by making a website with different information and custom assets. It's styled like an old 90's page (which I never truly saw, but I figure might be a selling point.)
The pages on my website include music, pictures, films and videos, art, and texts.

For the texts page, I have a literature section. I would like to include book pairings with brief descriptions. 

So I would like to ask your recommendations. What books do you think reflect Sonder? What books make you feel human, or relate to humanity and individuality and everyone having their own life.
I prefer succinct, rich, and complete works. But I will accept anything- as this, too, is ny attempt at compiling a connection of many different people.

For those wondering, now, the big reveal:
Sonder is defined as:

Blind bought this one purely off the hype and because I was craving a gourmand scent for the season. Totally loving the vibe it gives, that fresh mint opening blends beautifully into a sweet vanilla and honey base. Feels rich, cozy, and uplifting at the same time. Great pickup if you want something warm yet a little refreshing for winter evenings.

Opera Noir:
Milady has always loved the scent profile of YSL Black Opium, but that price tag stings 😅. So she went for Opera Noir instead, and honestly, it’s a great alternative. The jasmine + vanilla + coffee combo smells addictive and comforting, especially in chilly weather. Perfect for date nights or cozy evenings in.

1olohq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1olohq0/transformation_that_changed_my_life/,Transformation that changed my life,"A year ago, I was around 78 kg with no real routine—barely moved, ate a lot of junk, and stayed up late scrolling. I decided to make a change and started with home workouts for the first three months—mostly push-ups, squats, planks, and 20–30 minutes of walking daily. After that, I joined a local gym and learned basic compound lifts like bench press, deadlift, and squats, training 4–5 days a week. I also started tracking calories through an app, kept myself in a slight deficit, and made sure to get at least 7 hours of sleep. By month six, I had dropped down to about 71 kg, and by the 9th month, I started a lean bulk phase to build strength and muscle, gradually increasing my calorie intake.

My diet changed drastically during this year. I switched from random snacking to three balanced meals and two small snacks a day. My typical day looked like this: oats or boiled eggs with fruit for breakfast, chicken or paneer with rice and veggies for lunch, black coffee and almonds as a snack, and chapati with dal or grilled paneer for dinner. I drank 3–4 liters of water daily, avoided sugary drinks, and only had cheat meals occasionally. By the end of the year, I stabilized at around 74 kg—leaner, stronger, and much more confident than when I began.

1olof5y,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1olof5y/the_call/,The Call,"Alexis pushed open the door to her threadbare apartment and let the city noises swallow themselves behind her. After her third straight twelve-hour shift, the fluorescent glare and scripted voices still crawled beneath her skin. Tonight she’d held out longer than usual; the first sip didn’t come until 10:00, fifteen minutes later than the night before, a small, stubborn victory she repeated to herself. She told herself she was waiting until she left the job, that she could control it; when she finally tipped the little bottle to her lips, the warmth slid down her throat and, for a moment, the chorus of voices faded. She knew it was wrong. She also knew, with a clarity that made her chest hurt, that the bottle was becoming the only thing that could quiet them.

In the office, the headsets reeked faintly of toner and stale coffee, the supervisors’ canned optimism clinging to her skin like a film she couldn’t wash away. Home was no sanctuary either: her apartment carried the sour tang of old liquor, congealed takeout, and dreams that had gone rancid. She shoveled in a few forkfuls of fried rice, hardly tasting it, before pouring herself a glass of Rubinoff and pink lemonade, half and half, the closest thing she had to medicine. The first swallow burned and numbed in equal measure as she eased onto her sagging bed, flicking on Love is Blind as background noise, thumb already moving across TikTok and Tinder in a daze.

It was almost enough to dull the memory, but not quite. At 8 p.m., the cries had come through her headset: the panicked shrieks of a passenger after their car was clipped, metal folding in on itself with a shriek like tearing bone. Her driver, her boyfriend, hadn’t been wearing a seatbelt. What followed wasn’t what she wanted to remember, though it came back anyway, again and again, lodged in her ears like a splinter. She tried to drown it with the television, with the endless scroll of strangers’ faces, with another mouthful of vodka-lemonade. But nothing worked. Nothing, except drinking until the screams finally blurred into silence.

Working in a 911 call center had never been Alexis’s dream, not by any stretch. It was meant to be temporary, a way to pay rent while giving her a foothold in something adjacent to her studies. At first, there was even a strange satisfaction in it: the chance to help, to steady voices on the other end of the line. She still caught herself smiling when she remembered the panicked young man who had eaten too much of a Wonka bar and was convinced his heart was about to give out. But those small moments became rarer as the weeks wore on, for every harmless scare came the other calls, the raw screams, the sudden silences, the kind of horror that crawled inside her head and refused to leave. Little by little, the job began to eat at her, leaving her with ghosts she could never quite hang up on. And so she drank. She told herself it was temporary. But temporary had a way of stretching, of calcifying.

She had seen what alcohol could do. A father whose moods swung like a wrecking ball, one moment overbearing and affectionate, the next menacing, violent. The bruises on her mother’s face, the muffled sobs she shared with her siblings in the dark, had seared themselves into her memory. She had sworn she would never fall prey to the same disease.

But years have a way of wearing down promises. She came to understand what she hadn’t wanted to admit: alcohol, adderall, cocaine, they weren’t the problem. They were the solution. Her father hadn’t been just cruel; he’d been drowning. Drowning in demons too heavy to carry sober. And as she grew older, as anxieties gnawed at her chest and old memories clawed their way to the surface, she found herself reaching for the same lifeline.

The thought of it brought tears to her eyes, not the clean kind, but the tangled kind: regret and shame, anger and fear, and something worse still, the hollow echo of understanding.

She was lost in the blur of her screen when the phone lit up with the first call:

**(617) 555-0199**  
 *(Decline — Accept)*

She blinked hard, once, twice, then again, as if grit blurred her vision. But the number stayed. A surge of anxiety pressed against her chest, spreading cold fingers through her ribs, that unmistakable weight of dread. She hadn’t drunk much tonight, and for more than a week she’d touched nothing but alcohol. There was no other explanation, no chemical fog to blame. It had to be a mistake. A glitch. Her mind playing a trick.

And yet the number glowed back at her, patient, insistent.

Memory crashed over her like a wave she couldn’t hold back. She jabbed Decline and threw back another desperate swallow, but the voice rose anyway, faint, frayed, and pleading: *Please help*.

The words cut through her fog like glass. She lurched upright, heart hammering. Logic tried to assert itself; she had to make sense of it. When the responders reached that house, everyone inside had already been dead. She’d learned that the next day. And the call logs showed nothing, no record, no trace of a call from that number ever coming through.

But she couldn’t forget the voice. Or the number. And now both were back, glowing in the dark like something alive.

Alexis set the phone down on her nightstand and stood too fast. The room tilted. She hadn’t realized how much she’d drunk until her head went numb and her balance went with it. She caught herself on the bedframe, waited for the spinning to slow. First, she drifted toward the TV, noise, distraction, then thought better of it and turned toward the dresser. From the top drawer, she pulled a half-empty bag of THC sleep gummies. She needed to knock herself out, fast.

They’d started as hangover relief. Over time, the hangovers had stopped, but the gummies stayed. Habit more than help now. She chewed the gummies like medicine, slow and mechanical, willing her pulse to steady.

The phone buzzed again, rattling against the wood like something trying to crawl free.

She froze and turned. The same number flashed on the screen:

**(617) 555-0199**  
 *(Decline — Accept)*

Without thinking, Alexis staggered to the nightstand. She answered. Her throat felt tight, strangled by dread.

“Hello?” she managed, her voice barely more than a breath.

A small voice came through the static, trembling and faint. “Please help. My head hurts and I can’t breathe. My mommy and daddy are in bed, but they won’t get up.”

The words hit her like a punch. Her breath caught; a sob clawed its way up before she could stop it. She knew this couldn’t be real, couldn’t be happening. She slammed the call closed, the screen went black, and she fell onto her bed. Then the sobs came, raw and animal, shaking her from the inside out. She clutched at her hair, shaking her head as if she could dislodge the memory itself.

“You stupid bitch,” she gasped between cries. “How could you let it get this bad?”

Her hands rose and fell in self-directed fury, slapping her face until her skin burned, until she tasted salt and copper and shame. But the voice, soft, broken, and pleading, still echoed in her head, a ghost she couldn’t silence.

Alexis sat there for a long time; she couldn’t say how long. Her mind, blurred by alcohol and grief, spiraled in on itself as the girl’s voice replayed over and over, thin and fragile inside her skull. She cried until the tears stopped coming, until her breath came out in dry, shuddering gasps.

At last, she pushed herself upright, unsteady on her feet. She silenced her phone and tossed it onto the bed like something toxic, something that might ring again. In the kitchen, she yanked open the fridge and grabbed a bottle of Pink Whitney, deciding it could finish what the Rubinoff and Minute Maid cocktail had started. The gummies would handle the rest, drag her down into oblivion, and, if she was lucky, keep the voices there with her. She took a swig straight from the bottle. Even an alcoholic flinches at a hit of hard liquor; she winced as the syrupy sweetness burned its way down.

Back in her room, she collapsed onto the bed. The TV was already on, some reality show, no longer *Love is Blind,* murmuring in the background, faces she didn’t recognize saying things she didn’t really hear. She fumbled for the remote, found it wedged in the sheets, and began flicking through channels, searching for something, anything, that might drown her out.

After staring at the TV, really just staring into the void, Alexis finally clicked out of Netflix and shut off her Roku. She waited for the usual jarring burst of static that always followed. It did not.

Through the haze of her drink and the blur in her eyes, she realized she was looking at the dim interior of a home. It looked lived-in, ordinary, even handsome in a way: framed photos along the wall, a couch with a throw blanket folded neatly across it. Alexis was transfixed. It wasn’t like any show or movie she’d ever seen, no music, no cuts, no dialogue. Just the slow, suffocating stillness of a home at night. 

Then she saw it.

Along the far wall, an old coil heater sat beneath a window, the plaster above it stained with a dark, sooty bloom, yellow at the edges, brown and black at the center. Her throat tightened. Even through the blur of alcohol, she could see the condensation clinging to the glass above it, the telltale film of moisture and carbon. She knew what that meant.

She thought she had no tears left, but the sobs came anyway, raw, heaving, uncontrollable. She fumbled with the remote, mashing buttons, trying to change the channel, return to Roku, shut it off, anything. Nothing responded. And then the image shifted. The camera, if it were a camera, moved. Slow, deliberate. It turned away from the wall, gliding toward the stairs, and began to climb. And then she heard it, soft, shuddering sobs, the unmistakable sound of a child crying.

Alexis screamed. It wasn’t a word at first, just a strangled, pleading noise that broke apart into fragments: “No, no, no, please, I’m so sorry.” Her skull felt like it was splitting open, pressure building behind her eyes until she thought her brain might burst. The room tilted, nausea rising sharp and sour in her throat. She tried to stand. She couldn’t. She tried to look away. She couldn’t.

On the screen, the view climbed the final steps, each creak of the floorboards humming through the speakers like a heartbeat. The sound of crying grew louder, small, and panicked, interlaced with the faint, rhythmic ringing of an unanswered phone. The image turned down the hall, closing in on a bedroom door that was cracked slightly open.

Alexis fought the paralysis, every nerve screaming. She willed her eyes to close, begged for the simple mercy of a blink, but they wouldn’t obey. Her vision blurred with tears as the scene pressed forward, the camera drifting through the door as though the wood weren’t there at all. Inside, two motionless shapes lay under a rumpled duvet, their stillness unbearable. At the foot of the bed sat a little girl, knees drawn to her chest, cheeks streaked with tears. She stared toward the ringing phone with the hollow patience of someone waiting for help that would never come.

The cocktail of THC and alcohol reached its dreadful peak, turning the world around Alexis into a fevered blur. On the screen, the little girl began to sway, her eyelids heavy, lulled toward sleep by the unseen poison filling her home. Carbon monoxide, silent, colorless, merciless. Alexis knew how the story ended. Everyone in that house had been found dead. She had checked the call logs herself; there had never been a record, not a trace of a call that night. And yet here it was, playing before her eyes as if time itself were demanding she watch.

Her head pounded so violently that it felt like her skull might split. Her stomach lurched. Guilt, nausea, and panic collided, dragging her down until she collapsed onto her back. Her vision spun, colors streaking across the room as she fought to focus, to breathe. Somewhere in the static of her failing thoughts, she heard the sound that shattered her.

A phone is picking up. A sluggish, slurred voice, her voice, muffled and thick with drink:

“...911, what’s your emergency?”

The words struck like a knife. Alexis convulsed, the queasy whirl inside her erupting into a gush of pink vomit, vodka, lemonade, half-digested rice. It splattered across her chest as she tried, too weakly, to roll over. Her limbs refused her. She gagged, choked, and coughed violently as tears streamed down her face.

Through the gurgle of her own drowning breath, she heard the faint, trembling reply:

“Please help. My head hurts and I can’t breathe. My mommy and daddy are in bed, but they won’t get up.”

1olodv4,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Dazzling-Citron-5777/comments/1olodv4/how_i_lowered_daily_stress_in_7_days_using_a/,How I Lowered Daily Stress in 7 Days Using a 3-Minute Breathing Anchor,"Stress doesn't disappear overnight. But it can drop measurably in a week if you use a small daily practice tied to something you already do.

Here's what worked for me: a 3-minute breathing anchor. No apps. No equipment. Just slow breathing tied to a daily cue (coffee, lunch, shutdown).

Why this works:

Slow nasal breathing activates the parasympathetic nervous system. That's the ""rest and digest"" mode. Longer exhales signal safety to the body. Heart rate drops. Shoulders relax. Jaw unclenches.

The key is doing it daily and tracking the shift.

The practice (3 minutes):

1. Rate your stress right now (1–10 scale).
2. Breathe in through your nose for 4 counts.
3. Hold for 2 counts.
4. Breathe out through your nose for 6 counts.
5. Repeat 3 times total.
6. Rate your stress again.

What to notice:

Did your shoulders drop? Did your jaw relax? Did the number shift (even by 1 point)?

That's the proof. Small changes accumulate daily.

Log your session to measure progress over time.

|Date|Task|Minutes|Mood (1-5)|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
||Breathing anchor||||

By Day 7, you'll have 7 entries. Compare Day 1 to Day 7. The shift shows up in the data.

Micro-exercise to start today:

Pick your daily cue: after coffee, after lunch, or when closing your laptop. Set a reminder. Do the breathing anchor once today. Log the before/after stress rating. Done.

Common mistakes:

\- Skipping the mood rating. The rating is the proof. Don't skip it.

\- Trying to ""perfect"" the breath. Aim for consistent, not flawless.

\- Doing it once and quitting. Consistency beats perfection (aim for 70%+ days).",1,1762005179.0,u_Dazzling-Citron-5777,0,1.0,False

I was called to the frailty ward to prescribe some pain relief and laxatives for a few patients.

As soon as I entered the ward, I saw that HCA in the long corridor walking towards me, making constant eye contact.

Then she started to tighten her scrub top around her waist while walking (not sure whether this is something habitual she always does or if she was trying to show off her curves!)

I wasn’t paying attention to that bit anyway, but I was literally distracted by those dazzling eyes and perfect eyeliner.

I was about to crash into the tea and cake trolley (commonly kept in the corridor of geriatric wards to make tea parties for confused patients wandering around the ward who can’t sleep overnight), which was in front of me, but I managed to avoid it at the last second.

She kept smiling (that smile licked my brain) and then turned left and went into the sluice.

Do you think she was sending me some non verbal cues?

I forgot to offer her Costa coffee to return the favour (the cup of tea she prepped).",1,1762004821.0,doctorsUK,4,0.6,False

1olo7hb,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1olo7hb/lack_of_appreciation/,Lack of appreciation.,"I(35F) and my husband(36M) have been married for 4.5 years, together for 8. We have a 16 month old son and I am 7 months pregnant with our second child, a daughter. 
I have really been struggling with what I feel is a lack of appreciation from my husband. It really came to a head in the last couple of days and I need some help figuring how to deal.

My husband and I are both in medicine, he is in the ER and has actually been off the last 7 days. I work in private practice ID, I was off Tuesday and now this weekend. Last weekend I was on call, ended up working about 10 hours each day, leaving him to be primary parent. He handled it well, and I acknowledged that he was a good Dad all weeknd(thought our son spent Sunday afternoon with his parents, so it was really even the whole weekend). 
Monday comes back around and I let him sleep in, I get our son up, fed, dressed, and to daycare in addition to feeding our pets and letting the dogs out, prior to getting myself to work. I work all day Monday, pick up our son, and my husband is asleep on the couch in pajamas still at 430. This is normal for him on days off. 
Tuesday was my first day off in a week, my husband asked me to give our housekeeper/babysitter the day off because he doesn’t like being at home when she is there(she comes Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday). I do the whole morning routine for the whole house again, get son to daycare, drop my car off for service, go to my OB appointment, then get my Covid shot. Again my husband got to relax all morning, did some of his own projects/worked on his car by choice. We eventually get to Costco in the afternoon, then I put everything away and go pick up our son. The Covid shot knocks me on my butt, I feed our son dinner, pack up his lunchbox for the next day, and go to bed before 10. 
Wednesday comes around and our son is sick. I tell my husband he isn’t going to daycare and have our housekeeper/babysitter watch him. I leave for work at 720. She stays until 115, then hands baby off to my husband. I get home a little after 5, and feel like total crap. Take a 20 minute nap on the couch, which I get yelled for because I am “always asleep” and never help. I feed our son, bath him, get him to bed, and get myself to bed by 1030 again. 
Thursday I get up and our son is coughing and fussy. I decide to keep him home, I feed him breakfast, change his diaper, and put him in bed with my husband. I wake husband up and tell him son is sick he’s staying home with you. I leave for work about 820. At 852 my husband calls me screaming why is the kid here with me why didn’t you take him to school? I explain he is sick and am met with no he’s not that sick. I tell my husband ok if you don’t think he’s that sick then take him to school. About an hour later I get a video of our son crying in his high chair not eating chicken nuggets with the caption “he’s coughing so much I don’t know what to give him”. I respond poor boy, maybe a yogurt pouch. My husband the responds that he’s being sarcastic our son is fine. I tell him I will come home asap and write my notes from home. I am feeling horrendous physically anyways, I figure I just have what our son has in addition to Covid shot fatigue and being 7 months pregnant. By the time I get home, our son has been dropped off at MIL’s. I take a one hour nap then write my notes. When I get up from said nap my husband is asleep on the other couch. Once done with my notes and billing, I finish up making our Halloween costumes for my husband and I, then go pick up our son. After feeding and bathing our son, I ask my husband to help with one of three things- clean up mess our son just made in the bathroom, read him his story and put him to bed, or please pack up his lunchbox for the morning. He says he will get around to the lunchbox, I said so I can depend on you to handle lunchbox? Again “I’ll get around to it”.
Friday comes around. I get up and do whole house routine again, this includes getting baby into his costume for school(he is much better but still coughing) and making sure to remember the little Halloween goody bags for his class that I prepared last week. My husband got the snacks ready however the juice cup was not closed correct and leaked all over the lunchbox, I had to then clean out the lunchbox and refill the juice. My husband again sleeps until whenever he wakes up while I am at work. Our Halloween plan is to go to his parents house because they live in a busy neighborhood for trick or treaters, we are bringing over pizza for dinner. Our housekeeper is over cleaning in the afternoon. I asked my husband to please change the baby into long sleeves and change his diaper while I touch up my makeup and get changed. 
This is when things turn into a fight, we wanted to leave at 5, but at 520 my husband is yelling at me that I didn’t let him order the pizza because I asked him to do so much. He also is asking me where I put our son’s trick or treating bag, however I did not prepare one because he is 16 months. So I take the bag that he came home from school with that had little goody bags from his classmates in it. I am met with the question “did we make and send in goodybags?”. I ask if “we” is the right term to use, my husband says yes. So I respond in a not nice tone that “no, we did not prepare goodybags, however I did and made sure to get the done in advance and they were very cute with stickers and orange and black bows, I told you to look at them in my office when I made them.” I break down and cry the majority of the drive over to his parents telling him that I know our son won’t thank me but a little appreciation from him would be nice.
Rest of the evening is fine. 
Saturday(today!) we have our family Christmas card photos, I booked a 6am blowout. I took this time because our son wouldn’t be awake until after I get home and would not have to ask my husband to watch him. On the way home from my blowout I pick up egg sandwiches and coffees. My husband gets up, asks if I got my hair done, then I say hey there’s eggs and coffee over there(pointing to kitchen). When he doesn’t go to the kitchen for a few minutes I go look, he’s sitting in his office. I say “darling, I said there’s eggs and coffee”. I am met with thanks then yelling about how I didn’t tell him and how I have conversations with myself. He goes as far as to look at our security camera taping to prove that he wasn’t in the room when I said it(all while eating the eggs). I break, I break down and cry, I cannot take the constant lack of appreciation. I tell him this and he’s like “I said thanks”. I just feel like every little thing I do is met with anger and is just taken for granted. I explain this to him and he locks me out of his office and tells me I’m attacking him. 
I am stretched so thin, I hate him, I feel I do so much for our family and am just met with anger. We have a marriage counselor who we see about once a month. We mainly use her for issues about extended family visits and not getting along with in-laws. 
Thanks for reading and for any advice to help navigate this situation and feelings.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I was 300 lbs in April 2024. Started Mounjaro for weight loss the same month. Today, I am 217 and still losing weight weekly. Goal is 185.

All of my health issues have normalized—high blood pressure is gone, liver enzymes are normal, cholesterol is normal—everything. Even my enlarged liver is normal size now. 

I just had my third fibroscan. My CAP score in March 2024 was 400–the maximum number, with a 7.2 kPa. March 2025, 250lbs, CAP was 319, kPa of 5.0. And last week CAP was 121, kPa 2.0. The lowest CAP score is 100…so my liver is basically like a new car at this point! My NP was so impressed and excited for me. I walked out of there kind of dazed because I didn’t expect it would be so well.

As for diet, I reduced my meals and portions, cut out beef, minimized snacking, cut out ALL fast food and the only thing that I use that is Low Fat or Fat Free is dressing, but full fat everything else like yogurt or cream for coffee. 
When I’m hungry between meals I try to go for nuts, cheese, or fruit FIRST…but not always. 

I don’t follow any specific diet, and I go for long walks 2-3 miles a few times a week. Prioritize sleep. And don’t consume sugary food.

They used to work together and were wanting to go to a concert together but couldn't because said coworker's girlfriend wouldn't let them.

Co-worker got broken up with 2 months ago and is newly single. The other day he messaged my girlfriend and they were catching up. Now my girlfriend wants to meet him out for drinks. She said he's ""5 foot 1 so I have nothing to worry about"" and that she's told him she has a boyfriend.

I don't think my girlfriend is trying to cheat. We've not been together very long and everything is great. I just don't get this. Even if she doesn't see it as a date, he surely will? If not, what happens if they get on and meet up a few times and this guy ends up falling for her? I don't get why she would want to let a situation like that unfold. Why not go for a coffee? Why alcoholic drinks late into the night?

----------

From my girlfriend's perspective:

She's just catching up with an old work friend. She's mentioned him to me before, it's not some random new guy. My girlfriend has basically 2 friends. She had a large friendship group when she was younger but they've all fell apart and she wishes she had more friends, hence wanting to reconnect with an old co-worker.

----------

I'm worried I'm just being a paranoid idiot and there's nothing wrong with it. But the circumstances of it all... An old friend who's recently single and her going on what might be a date in his perspective... It makes me want to scream lol.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.

1olo0ix,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1olo0ix/no_contact_the_mental_part/,"No contact, the mental part","It's generally advisable to go low / no contact if there's no reciprocity. That is, you don't approach them for whatever reason, and they aren't actively seeking you out either in a romantic fashion e.g. asking you to a date and all that jazz.

No contact is seems simple enough. Stop engaging with them, take a step back. Stop seeking them out online, checking their socials, unfollowing or blocking them. Getting rid of anything that reminds you of them: pictures, gifts, phone numbers, texts,... putting them in a box and burying it.

Done, right? No. Not done. You're brain is screeching, this hurts. So what do you do? You turn to the fantasy, as you always do. You keep thinking about them, wondering, hoping. This could go on for months, or even years. They are still on your mind, even though, for all intents and purposes, they aren't physically in your life anymore. And that's a problem.

Now comes the hard part. You have to emotionally detach too. A mental no contact, if you will. This is scary because the idea of letting go of hope and diving into nothingness is unfathomable. But that's exactly what you gotta do, and there really is something else at the others side. So, here's how this goes.

With the real person gone, you're emotionally clinging onto an LO. An object that is actually a mental construct, a concept, an idea, a version of the person, a fantasy, a delusion,... in your mind. Each time you wonder, consider, think, fantasize, daydream,... basically mentally touch that construct, you reinforce it. On a basic level, you reinforce specific neural pathways, that keep you ensnared in this habit, tied to this idea. [You need to cut it off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrFkXNgrPQY) so that that part withers and dies.

I know. Harsh. But emotionally killing off hope like that, well, that's a matter of survival. You literally keep the LO, this idea, at the center of your own personal narrative, your own story. You let it run the show, let it inform and influence major goals, wants and desires for yourself. And in the end, it impacts your life making you lose out on opportunities to find actual happiness and fulfillment. Worse case, you end up wasting time and accumulating regrets. Not what you want for yourself.

So, how do you do that? 

You need to refrain and stop from touching the LO, this mental construct. You basically enforce a boundary on yourself to stop thinking, wondering, fantasizing. And you do that by noticing your thoughts. If you notice you're spiraling, stop and do a [grounding exercise](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/grounding-techniques). You gently shift your attention to the present moment, and than to something you're doing or wanted to do. You redirect your thoughts and you distract yourself. Could be getting up to get a coffee, could be going outside for a walk,...

This is directly addressing the intrusive thoughts and feelings. I'm not gonna lie, when you start out, especially when the LO is occupying your mind every waking moment, you'll need to do this literally hundreds of times a day. It's exhausting, it's grueling, it's relentless. It seem like there's no end to this... but there is. Each time you break your ruminations, you weaken that mental construct.

Even so, if I say ""don't think about the pink elephant"", what are you going to do? Right. Cutting out and killing hope isn't enough. You need to replace that void. Doing that means looking inwards and finding ways to give yourself joy, purpose, satisfaction and fulfillment in how you live your life. It means putting yourself back as the central character of your story. You could pick up old or new hobbies, work in new routines, go outside and do new things to meet new people, could be working on goals you wanted to attain i.e. start a business or get a new job, or do a project,... could be anything, as long as it captivates you and it makes the day fly by.

Moreover, you also need to reflect on yourself and why you became limerent in the first place. Often, this creeps up in times when you feel low, dissatisfied, stuck, uncertain,... in life. That's when habits like negative thinking, fears, catastrophizing,... pop up. Including... fantasizing about attractive people you've met. That's what's meant with using them as a ""coping behavior"" to self-soothe yourself. Don't get me wrong, it's not always like that. You could genuinely feel attracted to someone you don't know, with everything in else in life being okay. Limerence isn't a disorder, after all, and it can hit secure and confident people as well.

So... what if you're in a committed relationship? The exact same thing applies. It's often said that you ""need to reflect or focus on your relationship"". And to an extent that's true... but I would argue that's absolutely not the main focus. This is about you and your own life, first. Once you get a grasp on where this is coming from, you can start reflecting about how you view your partner. Are they a tangible, real, equal friend or companion? Or are they more like a ""presence"" that you're merely tolerating or ""suffering"" in your life? And how does that relate to how you understand yourself? Why did you choose your partner, and does that still hold up?

Should you see other people, instead? Well... same thing applies. If you don't do the work, you risk throwing yourself, again, at the [exact same type of unavailable people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkl-fFtt-Dc), whether in real life or via dating apps. Or you end up being with someone while not being emotionally available, which is kind of sucky behavior. If anything, if you do put yourself out there, make sure you do it with intent and purpose, not because you want to chase the thrill of infatuation and limerence once again. 

Personally, I spent past Spring and Summer in the throes of an LE. I spent weeks battling my intrusive thoughts in this way. It sucks, it's a very lonely place to be in, and it seemed like there's no end to this. Today, I feel like I'm in recovery. I've reclaimed many parts of my life, and I realized that I got here because I lost track of those over the past few years. I'm also in therapy, and I've realized how much of this is driven by insecure attachment and core  beliefs of what love ""should"" look like compared to what it actually is.

Oof, I've written a lot more than just about ""no contact"". Hopes this helps people.",1,1762004190.0,limerence,1,1.0,False

Here’s the problem I noticed 👇
Most local businesses spend a lot of money bringing customers in the first time — through discounts, Swiggy/Zomato ads, or Instagram offers — but they have no way to bring those same customers back again.

Once the sale is done, that’s it. They’re forgotten.

So I built a simple SaaS called LinkLoyal 💡

Every business gets a QR code for their shop.

Customers scan it when they visit.

After 3 visits (or any number they set), they unlock a free item — like “Free Egg Puff” or “Free Coffee.”

LinkLoyal automatically reminds inactive customers via email or WhatsApp (like, “Hey! Haven’t seen you in 2 weeks — your free puff is waiting ”).


And guess what?
Even a small bakery saw 18% more repeat visits in the first week just by using this simple system.

No app install, no complex POS. Just QR and rewards.

I’m still testing it with a few local shops before launch — but I’m curious:

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

Hope we have a good time :)

1olnvkn,https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/1olnvkn/spoiler_first_impressions_evo_44_nyx/,[SPOILER] First impressions EVO 4.4 (Nyx),"TL:DR Levski is awesome and it will definitely be my new home location: it has the ease to navigate like Grim Hex without all the trash. The outdoors have a great vibe and there are now cargo elevators that can be used from the landing pads. 

The patch feels pretty stable for an EVO build so hopefully it will come soon to everyone.

You can currently set your home location at three different areas in Nyx. I picked Levski because I hadn't seen my old friend for a long time :-)

**The good**

1. Levski station looks impressive - they've done away with the cookie cutter Stanton/ Pyro design. It feels unique: the best way to describe it is Grim Hex but without trash and a better flow.
2. We start straight in our hangar and the hangar is a resembles a Stanton hangar more than a Pyro one: the lightning is much better than the Pyro hangars. No longer do I need a torch to navigate through the hangar.
3. The med panel in the med bay now shows the cause of death: I backspaced and it showed ""probable cause: impact or suicide"".
4. The med bay looks close to a Pyro one but then the cleaned-up version.
5. I love the ASOP terminal hall at Levski - very spacious and organic
6. Grand Barter (the main shopping area) feels good: organic, with a unique design. The shops look similar to some of those found at Area18.
7. Inventory terminals are placed everywhere - you won't waste time searching for one as you may do at other stations.
8. The Ripper SMG is for sale at Levski :-)
9. I love the cafe area - it's refreshing seeing a different design: curtains, small string lights, separate booths and paintings.
10. I love the rumble that goes through the station at times. It's a nice environmental effect.
11. The armor shop is massive - and I love that the NPCs are now wearing wider selection of cloths and armor. Sadly, no new armours for sale.
12. The food and beverage area is spacious and easy to navigate.
13. NPCs were doing NPC things: eating, walking, talking, sitting etc.
14. There are new stores: a souvenir shop where you can buy a Bennie shirt, a fruit store, a coffee shop.
15. There is a central elevator that works without having to use an elevator panel; you just go to it - the doors open and it moves you to the other part of the station.
16. There is a ship store at Levski and it's easy to reach - just take the elevator from your hangar. It's dwarfs New Deal and it sells vehicles, ships and a wide selection of weapons and components (the weapon/component terminal bugged out after the initial interaction). The ships in the show room are: Golem, Aurora, Mole, Fortune, Nomad, Nursa, ROC DS, DS, Gladius, Cutter, Arrow, Reliant Kore, Freelancer Max. The cargo trolley was also there but it couldn't be interacted with.
17. Nyx has a beautiful blue hue with a white star. With all the bits and pieces of asteroids around Levski it feels you're in a deep ocean.
18. (not sure if this was in before)When you scan another ship you can now see the mode it is in: Quantum or Combat
19. There's some great music in Nyx.
20. No missions were available in space but as you get closer to the stations there are already some; Wikelo, Investigation, Parcel Delivery, Mercenary, Bounty Hunting and Interstellar Cargo Hauling.
21. The distances in Nyx with the few missions I picked are much more reasonable than Pyro. Some are a bit further than Stanton though.
22. For the parcel delivery mission I had to fly into deep space to recover a package from a Freelancer that was destroyed.
23. The exterior of Levski is absolutely stunning - while hangars are there of course there are so many landing pads which brings back memories of Port Olisar; but then on steroids.
24. There are seven landing pads close together and one a little bit further away at Levski (the latter doesn't have an elevator right now). These landing pads do not have an elevator to the station but each does have an external cargo lift. This will make it much easier to load and unload stuff to / from a station. Large turrets are placed around these pads.

**The not so good**

1. Some signage around Levski is currently low res - like from years ago.
2. The elevator controls didn't work when I left my hangar to explore the station. A quick backspace helped me move to the med bay. After that all the elevators work.
3. The inventory consoles at the med bay didn't work; they do work at all the other areas at Levski.
4. Performance was rough: low FPS at times and a server error but that is to be expected - likely a lot of logging was active.
5. Some of the racks at the weapons shop are only half filled.
6. NPCs are sometimes launched from the ground into the ceiling.
7. There are some NPC interactions but currently they default back to ""hi"" when you select any of the conversation options.
8. As they mentioned during CitCon: there is only Nyx present and the two Jump Gate stations: one to Stanton and one to Pyro.
9. The top elevator in the XL hangar is not present - only the shadow until it's completely closed. There are currently grey 512X panels visible instead (again it's EVO). They interact with the surface of the elevator causing some texture flickering.
10. The QMs do not show any text.
11. It's not possible to QT to Levski other than joining a party with someone who is there already or if you have a mission target.
12. The jump gate stations are the same as we have in Stanton and Pyro.
13. I was not able to request a hangar at Levski - every time I requested it is said request completed but no hangar was offered.",54,1762003813.0,starcitizen,5,0.98,False

I had a really nice conversation with someone through hinge for a couple days before asking if they'd be interested in meeting up for a coffee date. 

She gave me her number and we talked a little over the weekend and she actually asked about meeting up on Monday.

An hour before the date I asked if she was hungry and switched it over to a dinner date at a restaurant that serves good burgers.

Of course she ended up being beautiful, smart and funny lol.

I was pretty excited and my more excitable talkative personality shined through lmao.  uhohh.  Hand gestures and all.

With that said I asked her good questions so she did plenty of talking herself. We both laughed, smiled, were engaged and interested in our conversation and our date lasted 2 hours. 

At one point she asked if her photos looked like her and I enthusiastically responded, ""you look great"" and she said thank you.

I did get a little bit of a vibe that she might have thought I was a goober (goofy not to be taken serious guy).  She never gave me clear signs she was interested but she also said that she has a lot of anxiety and she's a bundle of nerves (wears teeth guard at night lol).

After I paid for the bill we got up and I told her what a great time I had but actually was going to fist bump her lol, but she laughed and said no and put her arms out and we did a little hug similarly to how we did when we greeted one another..

She never texted me after at all to say she had a good time or to thank me for dinner....  To me that was my sign that she wasn't interested and I never reached out and now it's 5 days later.

It just sucks because I almost never meet someone I actually like very often and I would have really enjoyed continuing to get to know her.  I really liked her.

Any thoughts on this?  In retrospect, I should have texted her after the date saying I had a great time and I'd like to continue getting to know her if she was open to that.  

A part of me kind of wanted to explain that when I meet someone I really like it's hard for me not to be really enthusiastic but that I calm tf down after a couple dates.

I didn't act weird or anything. I was cool and funny and fun, but I just know some people are freaked out by enthusiastic/excitable behavior.  it wasn't over the top by any means but I know there's an intensity to my personality.",1,1762003548.0,dating_advice,7,1.0,False

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

From the outside, everything looks fine. Stable job, loving partner, a place to call home.
But lately, I’ve been feeling… heavy. Like I’m carrying something invisible all the time. The stress from work, the pressure to keep moving forward, the quiet fear that maybe I’m just running on autopilot.

There are days when I wake up already tired. My body’s moving, but my mind feels far away. Sometimes I catch myself spacing out, staring blankly at nothing, wondering what happened to that lighter version of me — the one who used to dream, laugh easily, and get excited over small things.
I love my life, truly. But there are moments where the noise in my head gets too loud — the anxiety, the burnout, the constant “what ifs.” It’s hard to breathe sometimes.

One night, I was lying in bed scrolling through my phone, too drained to think. I stumbled upon a clip from an old anime I used to love back in college — one of those shows I’d stay up watching, crying over the characters, laughing at their dumb jokes, feeling alive in every episode.
On a whim, I decided to rewatch it. Just for nostalgia. Just to pass the time.

But the moment that familiar opening song started playing, something in me softened. It was like being gently pulled back into a memory — a version of me that felt safe, hopeful, alive. The colors, the voices, the emotions… they wrapped around me like a warm blanket.

For the first time in a while, my chest didn’t feel so tight.
It was… peace.
It was comfort.
It was like I had found a tiny light in all the noise.

As I watched, I started remembering the small things that used to make me happy — the smell of coffee at night, the sound of rain while watching anime, laughing with friends over silly theories. I realized that somewhere along the way, I had buried those little joys under the weight of adulthood.

And sitting there, rewatching an old show, I felt like I was meeting my old self again. The me who wasn’t always tired. The me who found meaning in stories, hope in characters, and beauty in the smallest moments.

The world didn’t change after that, but something in me did. The stress is still there, but it doesn’t drown me as easily anymore. The anxiety still visits, but I know where to find a bit of calm when it does.

Now, whenever life feels too heavy, I go back to those old anime worlds. They remind me that I’m still allowed to slow down, to rest, to feel safe. They remind me that I don’t have to be strong all the time.

It’s strange, isn’t it? How a simple show from years ago can quietly heal parts of you that words can’t.

Maybe I don’t have everything figured out yet. Maybe I’m still learning how to breathe again, how to live gently.
But for now…
I have a bit of peace.
And maybe, just maybe — that’s enough.

It takes forever to percolate.

It starts smoking.

It smells like a mix of roasted coffee and melting rubber.

You ask yourself why it's taking so long.

After about a minute of brewing only smoke and dreams, you realize what you've done.

So you pull it off the stove and drop burned coffee grounds into your scrambled eggs.

You toss the mess of grounds and burned gasket melted onto the paper filter into the trash.

You look for the backup gasket that you *know* is in the cabinet. It's not there.

So you grab the 3 cup moka pot and proceed to make 2 batches - one for your wife and one for yourself.

Proceed to drink coffee a full 30 minutes after you started.

My heart rate went up to 152 bpm. I immediately went to the ER. They did an ECG and found tachycardia, then gave me meds. After that, they repeated the ECG, and my heart rate had gone down. They also did blood tests, but nothing abnormal showed up. However, I couldn’t get over the experience because the palpitations happened out of nowhere. If I had drunk coffee or an energy drink, I wouldn’t have been so worried, since I’d know what caused it. But having it happen while I was just sitting made me really scared, and I couldn’t stop thinking, “What if it happens again?” I had never experienced anything like that before. Sure, I had minor palpitations before, but nothing that intense, so I was terrified.

Later, I went to a cardiologist. They did another ECG, and my heart rate was a bit fast again (probably because I was nervous), around 93 bpm. The doctor reviewed all my previous ECGs, did an echo, and said everything looked normal. He told me it was most likely related to panic attacks and anxiety, and prescribed a beta blocker just to help me feel calmer. After that appointment, I felt a bit better for a while, but soon I started having occasional pain in my left chest, sometimes spreading to my left arm. The pain would go away quickly and it was probably caused by gas, since I’ve been having digestive problems lately. Still, my brain refused to accept that explanation. I started touching my chest all the time, constantly checking my pulse. Whenever I feel even the slightest pain in my heart, I think I’m going to die.

I’m terrified, im always thinking about my heart, researching heart problems and diseases, wondering if I might have one.

Átlagosnak neveztek, pedig különlegesnek érzem magam","A sub segítségét szeretném kérni, mert literálisan a legmélyebb kétségbeesésbe vagyok taszítva. Eddig biztos voltam benne, hogy különleges és egyedi redditor vagyok. Ha valaki megkérdőjelezte volna, csak annyit mondok neki fölényes mosollyal, hogy *""aprópénz az elmém ikszdé""*. De a múlt héten a tinder randim vágta a fejemhez, hogy nem vagyok annyira különleges, inkább átlagos, és ettől teljesen broken lettem.

Segítenétek eldönteni az alábbiak alapján, hogy különleges vagyok vagy inkább átlagos?

Nem vagyok unalmas alak, vannak hobbyjaim (Netflix n chill, i'm a coffee lover, craft beer enthusiasm). Társalgásban sem vagyok novice szinten, bármikor be tudok dobni a reddit subos beszélgetésbe egy meme-et vagy copypasztát. Az AI promptolásban is pro vagyok, a múltkor harminc felcsútot kaptam a bicikliző nutellamacskás videómra.

Bátran felvállalom az unpopular opinionöket is, mindig oda is írom, hogy ""tudom, ezért le fogtok pontozni..."", aztán bátran kifejtem, hogy a gyilkosságot súlyosabban kellene büntetni, és a környezetszennyezés rossz dolog.

Élőben egy kicsit nehezebben megy a talkolás, de csak azért, mert mély, nehezen megfogalmazható, egyedi gondolataim vannak, ezért előfordul, hogy húsz perces szünetek állnak be a beszélgetésekben. De hát nem a felszínes csevegés embere vagyok, ezt muszály leszögeznem.

Egyedül a fizetésem, ami talán picit átlagos. Nettó egymillió, havi húsz nap home office-szal, de nehezen jövök ki belőle. Bár a kiszámoló subon megnyugtattak, hogy az egymilla az tök alap fizu, nem csoda, hogy hóvégére elfogy a pénz.

A politikai nézeteim is világosak és egyediek. Utálom a Fideszt, amiért tizenöt év alatt ezermilliárdokat lopott, eljátszotta az ország becsületét, elszegényített milliós embertömegeket és tönkretette a következő három generáció lehetőségeit, de a Tiszát is pont ugyanannyira utálom, mert MP a múltkor beszólt a telexnek. Úgyhogy inkább leszavazok a kutyákra.

Társkeresésben is full unique vagyok. Redditen ha egy csaj panaszkodik, hogy nem talál párt, mindig odakommentelem, hogy ""RIP inbox"". Ilyenkor titokba reménykedem, hogy majd rámír a lány, hogy végre van valaki, aki nem írogat rá, hanem leoltja a többi, írogató pasit. Eddig ez nem történt meg, de nem adom fel a reményt.

Tinderen előfizettem a Gigachad nyali-lájk csomagra. Egyenlőre nincsenek sikereim, talán azért mert különleges vagyok, nincsenek egekben az elvárásaim. Én nem a 185 centi magas, szőke, 90-60-90-es modellekre megyek rá, totál beérném egy 180 centis, barna vagy természetes vörös, szép arcú, sportos, stem diplomás lánnyal is, aki elfogad olyannak, amilyen vagyok. (Korábban voltak, akik szóvá tették, hogy kicsit aputestem van, ezért most már előre leszögezem, hogy nekem fontos az elfogadás).",1,1762002415.0,hungary,15,0.53,False

1olnaiw,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1olnaiw/i_feel_like_im_at_my_limit_trenta_rant/,I feel like I'm at my limit ((Trenta Rant)),"368 partner here! I've been with the siren for the last 3.5 years and frankly I no longer want to be. Now this isn't the first time I've felt this way in my time working, hell I felt this way at least once a year every year I've worked here. A lot of various reasons: I felt like I couldn't keep up with everything, the stress of the BOGOs and offers and promos, and now Burrito Boy and his dumbfuck changes. 

I know there's a lot of people who've complained about the dress code policies already, but I still stand with the fact that it stripped any individuality from the baristas. Then there's all the Back to Starbucks changes, wanting to bring back the cafe experience. That's just a conservative as hell idea ((conservative as in the sense of not wanting to change or return to an older standard, not the political association)). The way society views starbucks, plus the systems they have in place ((Mobile Ordering, Drive Thru, Deliveries)) spits in the face of it. They claim that they want customer connection scores to rise, all the while All Day OTW times stay lower. But like we're dealing with the most inconsistent variable in this entire job; Customers! You can have the exact same team every single day and still get varying drive thru times because the customers make so much variation in how long interactions take, between issues with payment, adding stuff at the window, or having larger orders. Feeling pressured to greet *Every. Single. Customer.* is almost straight up cult behavior, and I call it out everytime I get the chance to, but we do it because otherwise we get corrective actions. Then there's the writing on cups, it's another thing that adds Drive Thru times but like it's completely asinine. I've seen a few people on here complain about not wanting writing on their cups ((especially cold drinks because the sharpies are liable to smear off)). But the sheer fact that if we happen to forget to write on one cup and it happens to be a higher up salary member, the fact that the *possibility* of losing our jobs is there makes me feel uncomfortable in the security of it.

And now with them changing the routing system, it's so fucking janked up that it's a lot more stressful than the old way we did it. They say that we need to be patient and accepting of changes, but when the changes lead to drive thru drinks getting lost under 10 cafe order, a mobile order's food constantly getting shoved deeper and deeper into the pile of ""higher-priority orders"". You can tell all these changes were made to try and work their conservative desire to make Starbucks a cafe spot again, but again there's the problem of all the other aspects that goes against that mission. If you want to push the cafe experience, fucking go all way or fucking don't. Especially if the last however many years the company, and society have been pushed towards the aspects of timely convenience and on the go nature.

And now they're introducing an AI assistant to the stores iPads, yet they claim to want ""help the environment"", perhaps if you want to do better for the environment maybe you should look into the QA of the cups and lids manufactured for the customers to ensure not just minimizing waste, but also human safety, both customers and partners alike have had drinks spill on them due to faulty manufacturing, and some of these drinks are 145-almost 200 degrees. The hot lids are clearly not meant to support the heat of the Vertica, they warp and bend under it so much I worry it's just gonna melt when a customers goes to take a drink.

Now onto the Hypocrisy!! Burrito Boy has claimed to want to ""simplify the menu"" so back in like May-June we lost a majority of buttons, namely a lot of Frappucino buttons. Customers could still of course order it, we didn't get rid of the ingredients, just the one and done button that had it under a distinct name a solid price. Now however we need to go and put everything in manually, which can also go into the waste aspect if you want since it uses more of the sticker reel to print the same drink. Also not even a month after wanting to simplify the menu they go and add the Firework Frappucino, and a week or two later the Strato Frappucinos. Then they make statements about how they're discontinuing certain bakery items ((brownies and vanilla bean scones mainly)) only to later crawl with their tails between their fucking legs and bring them back ((probably because they were able to find someone who could make it cheaper for them)).

Now comes the issue of why I haven't jumped ship. To be completely honest, me and my wife are barely surviving on my paychecks and the job market where we live right now is currently more dead than the dinosaur fossils in a museum. But also if you take away the corporate bullshit; the mandatory cup writing, the strict dress code, the time sensitive stress of it being a fast food industry- I enjoy my job. I love making people's days brighter. I love making coffee. I love feeling like I'm a part of my community. But all the corpo shit makes me just go in for the paycheck and nothing else. I only put the bare minimum effort into my work because I need the money and the insurance. There's no passion behind my drive to go above and beyond expectations because every ounce of love I've had with the job is getting squeezed out the more and more changes they bring. Realistically I would like to try and find something ((preferably remote and)) in data entry where I don't need to interact with other people constantly, but again the job market in our city is trash. So I'm stuck here in a dead end job, everyday that passes by I feel my restraint towards walking out and never setting food back fades more and more but then the grounded reality of bills, medication, insurance keep me there.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

In the digital age, running a small business is tougher than ever. Competition is fierce, customer attention spans are short, and traditional advertising methods like flyers, billboards, or radio ads no longer bring consistent results. Today, customers search online first — whether they’re looking for a café nearby or a **digital marketing agency** that can help their brand grow.

This is where **Search Engine Optimization (SEO)** becomes a game-changer. For small businesses in 2026, SEO isn’t just another marketing buzzword — it’s a *secret weapon* that can transform visibility, attract local customers, and build long-term credibility.

Let’s explore how SEO can drive massive growth for small businesses and why it should be your top marketing priority this year.



# Why Digital Marketing Matters for Small Businesses

Small businesses are the backbone of India’s economy — from local bakeries and fitness studios to startups and consultants. But in 2026, simply having a product or service isn’t enough. You need to be *discoverable*.

Here’s why digital marketing, especially SEO, is crucial for growth:

* **Customers live online:** Almost every customer uses Google before making a purchase decision.
* **Affordable reach:** Compared to TV or newspaper ads, online marketing is more cost-effective and measurable.
* **Local advantage:** Local SEO ensures your business shows up when people nearby search for your services.
* **Long-term results:** Once your site ranks on Google, you get free, organic traffic for months or even years.

In short, digital marketing helps small businesses compete with big brands — without needing a massive budget.



# Why SEO is the Secret Weapon for Business Growth in 2026

SEO has been around for years, but in 2026, it’s more important than ever. The way customers search and buy has evolved dramatically. Voice search, AI recommendations, and mobile-first browsing dominate the landscape — and SEO sits at the center of it all.

Here’s how SEO can change the game for your business:



# 1. SEO Builds Trust and Credibility

When your business appears on the first page of Google, customers automatically perceive it as trustworthy. Most users rarely go beyond the first page, so ranking higher gives you an edge.

For instance, if your salon, café, or fitness center appears when someone searches “best salon in Mohali,” it instantly boosts your credibility.



# 2. Local SEO Helps You Dominate Your Area

If you’re running a small business that serves a specific location, **Local SEO** is your best friend. It helps you appear in Google’s “near me” searches and map listings.

**Quick local SEO tips:**

* Create and optimize your **Google My Business** profile.
* Add consistent business details (address, phone number, website) across platforms.
* Collect positive customer reviews.
* Use location-based keywords like “SEO services in Mohali” or “digital marketing company in Chandigarh.”

With a well-optimized local presence, your business can attract steady foot traffic and calls — without running ads.



# 3. SEO Delivers Long-Term, Compounding Results

Unlike paid advertising, which stops the moment you stop spending, SEO keeps giving results long after your initial efforts.

When your website ranks for relevant keywords, it brings a continuous stream of visitors — day and night. That means your business can keep growing even while you’re focusing on other operations.

Think of SEO as a digital investment that keeps appreciating over time.



# 4. Content-Driven SEO Builds Brand Authority

Content marketing is the heart of modern SEO. By creating valuable blogs, guides, and videos, you not only educate your audience but also establish yourself as an expert in your field.

For example:

* A local café can post “5 Coffee Brewing Tips for Beginners.”
* A real estate firm can publish “How to Choose a Flat in Mohali.”
* A marketing startup can share “Top SEO Trends in 2026.”

Search engines reward businesses that create useful, original content — and your customers will too.

If you need expert help building your content and SEO strategy, you can always partner with professionals at [**Akash Digital Hub**](https://akashdigitalhub.com/), a trusted **digital marketing agency** helping small businesses grow with SEO and online advertising.



# 5. SEO Helps You Compete with Bigger Brands

SEO levels the playing field. You don’t need a massive budget to outrank big companies — just the right strategy.

By focusing on local keywords, optimizing your website, and publishing valuable content, you can attract customers who might otherwise go to large competitors.

That’s why many small businesses now consider SEO their most valuable growth tool in 2026.



# Key SEO Practices to Implement in 2026

If you’re ready to start leveraging SEO, here are some key steps every small business should take:

1. **Perform keyword research** — Find what your target audience is searching for.
2. **Optimize your website** — Use keywords naturally in titles, headings, and descriptions.
3. **Build backlinks** — Earn links from trusted websites to boost your domain authority.
4. **Create regular content** — Post blogs, guides, or videos every month.
5. **Track your progress** — Use Google Analytics to see what’s working and what’s not.

Small, consistent efforts in SEO will bring steady results over time.

So looking to buy an electric and considering these two.

Honestly I’d like to spend 200€ and the Fred falls in that budget but the DF54 comes much more highly rated …. will the Fred be good enough? 

Trade offs are higher retention on the Fred , and it’s loud , aesthetically it would match my machine so that’s actually a plus , the hopper space I don’t need but also don’t mind and I guess the grind consistency is a bit worse (however I don’t have a pro palette , even though I enjoy mostly drinking just an espresso shot without milk so the shot quality matters for me)

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

My thought was that, on October 31, it would **not** be overfunded in Nov (I could spend all the cash in that category on Halloween candy or something). But, if I didn't touch that cash going to Nov 1, now it should be overfunded as the Available amount is greater than the ""Refill up to"" goal.

He wasn’t even an ex officially as we never were boyfriend/girlfriend since our place and time just didn’t work out. We met just prior to me moving for a job (honestly was just looking for a one night stand) and had a few hangouts before I moved because we just were enjoying each other so much. During this time, we connected on many things and when I think back to him I truly miss our interactions. We texted every single day after I left and he even visited me in my new town for a week. We ultimately decided to stop our thing during this time since I moved to a new city and he was figuring out his next move as well. A few months later, I met my current fiancé who is the sweetest, most loving man. I really do enjoy my time with him so that’s why this is all so confusing to me. A few months after I met my now fiancé, I forget what it was about but somehow we started messaging each other again and later on he sent me a message saying how he missed seeing me and was wondering if we could FaceTime sometime. I was young and didn’t really know this at the time, but I now know I have a very avoidant attachment style and so my first panicked reaction was to heart react his message and not respond and avoid it all together. I think it was because I just met my current partner and I was/am in love with him so I didn’t want to FaceTime an ex while I was moved on to someone else. Looking back now 5 years later, I regret just liking his message and not responding, I feel like he deserved more than that like at least communicate that I’m seeing someone else so that wouldn’t be appropriate or something of that nature. I also feel upset because it was a wrong place and time situation so it just didn’t work out. I keep thinking if I didn’t have plans to move away that we would’ve worked out or at least the relationship could have ran its course (whether that means breaking up or staying together forever who knows). All of these thoughts have me feeling extremely guilty to my fiancé who doesn’t deserve this from me. I have tried for years to forget about this ex and move on but the thoughts just keep coming back. The urge to message him and just spark up a conversation feels absolutely debilitating. My mind wonders ok if I do message him, what the hell do I think will be the outcome of that? For reference, he has since moved to a different country and is dating someone else too. So my mind goes through the motions of me messaging him saying something stupid like “how have you been?” and who knows where the conversation will go from there. Then I would feel extremely guilty for having messaging him in the first place. It doesn’t change the fact that we live on opposite sides of the world and are in relationships with other people. It’s not like we can just get a cup of coffee and catch up like they do in the movies.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

1oln0um,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlasFeels/comments/1oln0um/letters_to_the_empty_room/,Letters to the Empty Room,"It’s another night and I am staring at this fucking laptop again. The glow sits on my face like a cold hand. The room is quiet in that heavy way that makes every small sound feel like a confession. My breath sounds uneven. My jaw is tight. I keep telling myself to write something honest and then I freeze because honesty feels like a kind of exposure I am not sure I can survive. Still, I am here, trying.

I keep thinking about failure like it is a place I live in. Not a moment. Not a single event. A neighborhood with the same streets I walk every day. I know all the cracks on the sidewalk. I know which corners smell like old rain. I know where I tripped last time and where I will probably trip again. People say failure teaches you. I guess it did. It taught me how to expect less of myself. It taught me how to brace for the next fall even before I stand up.

Money is a mess. Heart is a mess. Work is a mess. I show up, say the right words, move my hands in the right order, but it feels like acting. I used to think progress meant climbing. Now it feels like crawling across glass, slow and stupid, with no finish line. I am tired of the noise in my head that says try harder and the other voice that says try what, exactly. I hold both at once and drop both anyway.

Regrets stack up in quiet ways. Not always the big ones. A look I avoided. A message I never sent. A small kindness I owed and did not give. A truth I swallowed until it soured in my throat. The past sits in the corner like a box I refuse to open, but the lid never fully closes and the edges cut my hands when I try to push it down. I keep telling myself that I did the best I could with what I had, but some days that feels like a weak apology. I should have known better. I should have been kinder. I should have stayed when I left and left when I stayed.

Love hurts in stupid ways. I gave too much to people who gave me almost nothing and still I waited for a miracle. I kept rewriting their silence into softer stories. I said maybe they are busy, maybe they are scared, maybe I am asking for too much. Then I learned that silence is an answer unless someone is trying to change it. I was the only one trying. I was always the only one trying. It does something to your chest when you realize that. It makes you feel like a misprinted page that should have been thrown away. 

 I kept parts of myself quiet for so long that I started to forget I even had a voice. Attraction arrived like a storm I could not admit I wanted. I learned to nod and laugh and use the right words so nobody would ask me hard questions. Then the quiet became a habit and the habit became a kind of lie, and I got good at wearing it. I have loved people I was not ready to name and I have watched them walk away toward safer lives. I told myself I was protecting them or protecting myself. Maybe I was only practicing the art of absence.

I keep remembering one person. The way their laugh felt like a door opening. The way the air around them felt brighter, like the room finally had windows. I said nothing. I gave them careful friendship and swallowed everything else until my throat felt raw. I tried to move on. I dated people who looked good on paper and nodded at the right times. It never stuck. My heart kept drifting back to a house that was never mine. I do not blame them. I blame the part of me that confuses longing with proof that I am alive.

Hope used to show up in small flashes. A line in a book that felt true. A song that made the air lighter. A morning where the coffee tasted like a promise. I still get glimpses, but they fade before I can hold them. I reach out and they are already gone, like trying to catch smoke with a closed fist. I want to want the future. I want to care about it the way I used to. Most days I just watch hours pass and call it living because the other words feel too big.

The body carries so much of this. The tense shoulders, the shallow breathing, the stomach that tightens for no clear reason. I tell myself to ground. Feet on the floor. Hands on the desk. Name five things I can see. It helps, then it doesn’t, then it does again. I try to eat like a person who believes they will need energy later. I try to sleep like a person who expects morning to matter. Some nights the mind will not stop tugging at old knots and I lie there counting the ugly thoughts like beads on a broken string.

Friends ask how I am and I say fine. I say tired. They nod. I nod. We trade weather and headlines and pretend that covers it. I love them, I do, but I feel like a guest inside my own life while they seem to own theirs. They dream out loud. They make plans. I once made plans. Now I make lists and lose them. I tell myself this is a season and seasons change. Then the calendar flips and the air tastes the same.

I think about family. The expectations that sat on my shoulders like a coat I could not take off. Be strong. Be good. Be a model of something I did not choose. I learned to smile with my mouth and hide with my eyes. I learned to carry pride and shame in the same pocket. The pride was heavy, the shame heavier. I still love them. I still fear the look on certain faces if I ever told everything. Maybe I am not giving them enough credit. Maybe I am giving them too much. I do not know. That uncertainty has teeth.

I wish I had a clean lesson to write down. A line that says here is what all this pain means. The truth is I have no lesson. I have a stack of days that look alike and a heart that will not stop trying to make sense of them. I have moments where I feel human again, like when someone laughs at my joke or when the sky pulls off a perfect sunset and forgets to charge me for it. I hang on to those. I pin them to the corkboard of my mind like small bright flags so I can prove to myself that light exists, even when I cannot see it.

I want to forgive myself for not being the person I promised to become. I want to forgive the kid in me who flinched at touch and praise and chose distance because it felt safer. I want to forgive the adult who still does the same. Forgiveness feels like a door I keep pushing that opens only from the inside. I keep knocking. I keep waiting for footsteps. Some days I think I hear them. Most days it is just my own echo.

People tell me to practice gratitude. I try. A roof over my head. A body that still carries me. Music that understands me better than I understand myself. The friend who checks in with a meme that makes me snort water through my nose. The stranger who held the elevator and said take your time. These are real. I write them down so I cannot deny them later. Gratitude does not erase the grief, but it reminds me I am not made of only grief.

I do not want to vanish. I just want rest that is not heavy with shame. I want quiet that does not feel like punishment. I want to walk into a room and not count how I am failing in it. I want to love without hiding and be loved without shrinking. I want to trust my own hands with my own life. None of that sounds big when I say it out loud. It feels big when I reach for it.

So I write. I write as proof that I am still here. I write to pin down the storm so it cannot toss me around quite so much. I write because the page does not interrupt, does not look away, does not try to fix me with easy sentences. The page lets me be messy and still counts it as language. Maybe that is enough for tonight. Maybe holding the mess with both hands is the bravest thing I can do.

If I wake up tomorrow, I will try again. Not with fireworks. Not with grand plans. With water. With a shower. With a shirt that smells like sun. With a text that says I am thinking of you to someone who once made me feel less alone. With breakfast I can taste. With a walk where I let the sky do the talking. With one task finished even if it is small. I will try to be a person in the basic ways and see if the rest shows up.

For now I will sit here a few minutes more and breathe like my lungs still want me. I will let the glow of this screen soften. I will let the night be night without turning it into a verdict. I will close this entry and tell myself that words count, even when they tremble. I am not better. I am not fixed. I am here. And tonight, that is the truest sentence I have.",2,1762001454.0,AlasFeels,1,1.0,False

I started dating my girlfriend which I will call Jess at the beginning of the year and she put a boundary in place straight away which is “if you have a problem with Ben (her ex 37M from years ago) then we shouldn’t get together because he’s not going anywhere” I told her that Ben would always be abit of an insecurity for me as he’s your ex. 

I don’t know if I’m overreacting, overthinking or generally just an anxious person but I don’t know if this is normal and it’s starting to really get to me. 

Jess broke up with me a month ago. We had a plan to go check out this new spot in town and have a few drinks on the Friday, Thursday comes around I go over to hers and surprise her with coffee, we’re talking, and I mention the plan tomorrow and ask what she’s planning on wearing, straight away she turns round and says she can’t do Friday as she’s hanging out with Ben. I tell her that I thought we had this planned for weeks, she tells me that she forget and that we forget stuff all the time so let’s just do Saturday instead. I go in the kitchen, she comes in and asks what’s wrong I tell her I’m pissed off, that I thought we had a plan, she starts crying and tells me she can’t do this anymore and walks out of the kitchen. I leave tell her I love her and wish her good luck in the meeting. 

Now I’m spiralling, I’m angry, hurt, annoyed. We had each others locations so I could see where she was going. She went to Bens house, stayed there for a few hours and shortly after she left she sent me a text saying that she can see why I would be annoyed and that she’s sorry for making me annoyed and then says she’s too overwhelmed for this relationship, that she’s not doing the best and that she can’t give me what I need. Me surprised and ask is she’s breaking up with me. I replied telling her that I’m sorry that I couldn’t give her what she needs in this moment and wish her the best of luck ( I ain’t gonna fight for someone who wants to break up with me, a relationship is a choice and if she’s choosing to break up with me then I’m gonna let her ) She replies yeah when I said I can’t do this anymore I wasn’t joking and then she goes onto berate my character, tells me that the relationship was unhealthy, that she’s overlooked all the red flags and that she shot herself in the foot by even being in a relationship with me. 

That hurt so fucking much. Not only did she break up with me but she berated my character and acted as if the relationship was shit. 

Anyway 10 days later she messages me asking me to give her a date for me to come over to collect my things, we slowly start talking again and agree to meet up. We meet up and reconnect, she tells me she’s really sorry, that she was overwhelmed, her period started and she was angry that I just let her breakup with me. 

We briefly touched on the break up she tells me that she’s very sorry, that she’s completely in love with me and I’m the only person she wants. I tell her that she hurt me so much. 

It’s been four weeks and I don’t know how to bring up the breakup. I wanna talk about it, I want to get all my feelings out but I’m just scared to ruin the relationship again. 

My biggest issue is about Ben and the closeness they have. They talk everyday, they keep each other updated about everything is there lives, she covers him for rent and bills, cooks him dinner, does his washing I mean he still has a fucking key to her place. I feel like there relationship is very ambiguous, crossed massive boundaries and it doesn’t make me comfortable at all. I’ve tried to relax more, not overthink and overanalyse and I’ve done great…..until she went to his and broke up with me. 

I don’t think she’s physically cheating on me or anything like that. I know she loves me. My biggest issue is that I feel as if she’s more open to him about her personal stuff if that makes sense. Obviously they’ve known each other longer so their emotional connection is greater than ours and that is something I’m having a hard time to move past. 

I love this girl and can see a future with her but without Ben in her life or atleast not a big part of her life. I don’t know what to do. 

How normal is it for someone to keep an ex in their life and talk to them everyday? Am I just being insecure and catastrophizing everything? ",1,1762001204.0,AITA_Relationships,4,0.67,False

I’ve made yelping/OW noises when she tries to nibble on me, but I think she thinks I’m just playing with her. Any tips or better things I can give her?

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

1olmr3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1olmr3w/our_relationship_broke_down_twice/,Our relationship broke down twice.,"I'm 27 and she's 24. Our relationship broke down twice, each time after about a year. Last year, after our second breakup, we didn’t talk for a month, then I invited her for coffee and told her I wanted to win her back. Over time, it worked — she saw a change in me and we got back together after about a month.

Now the same thing happened again. We broke up, and it’s been about two weeks of no contact. She suggested staying friends, but I know that would just be a mental trap — she would get over me faster because I’d still be around, while I’d just suffer because I can’t have her fully.

The breakup was peaceful — I wanted to continue, but she said our values and mindset are different. I want a family, she’s focused on her career (she works two jobs). She felt I was pressuring her for more time together — in a month we saw each other only about five times, since it’s a long-distance relationship and we’re both in our final year of university.

She also said we should’ve tried living together earlier, but I was too focused on school (I had 14 courses). Now I’ve started working part-time as well, like her, but she said it’s too late.

After the breakup she sent me a few Reels and even texted asking how I felt. She said things like “maybe we deserve better partners” or “if you’re unhappy, break up with me,” but I think that was more a defense mechanism. She even said she had a mental breakdown the day after the breakup, but later said she’s a “rock.”

We recently exchanged our things — I told her I respect her decision but that I’d be open to a third chance if life gave us one. She said she wouldn’t want that, but I’m not sure she truly meant it.

Intimacy was also an issue — she’s asexual, but I always told her I cared more about emotional connection than sex. I think I’ve been a patient and understanding partner, and I still feel like I want to try again — but I don’t know what to do now.",2,1762000664.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

Now I am on track with a proper job that's really interesting, I am slowly losing weight and I have barely done any hobbies in the first month. I do not like that.

I am a single woman and I am gone 10-11 hours for the work day depending on traffic or how late the train is. When I get home I make myself to get SOME housework done and then I collapse on the couch and go to sleep so early, I am in bed 9-11 hours. No PC games during the week, no painting minis, being kind of happy when my roleplay session gets cancelled, cause that means I don't have to prep (I only GM one), no workouts or walks in the woods, barely any reading, just audiobooks while driving.

I want to bring back in some joy, but I feel too tired for it. 

Took me a whole month to make myself go to my beloved Sneak Preview in the new town. (It was great, but why did it take 5 weeks.) I am already meal prepping a little. (Can't eat the same thing ALL week.) I do not have the money for a cleaner, going out to eat a lot or doing expensive groupon things. Also I have no friends here yet.

Machine question: Has anyone had a Breville/sage product and could compare usage? Now, it could have been user error, but the steaming process was ear-piercing- hoping the GCP is quieter. Also, if you remove the grinding process out of the equation, how quick from powering on the machine to drinking a latte? 

Grinder question: If I buy single dose, I think I'm going to pre-weight my beans and store them in little coffee bean storage tubes. (Any downside on this?). Commonly recommended grinder DF54/64 seems loud. Is the Eureka Silenzio quieter? (I'd be interested in a mod to get a single dose hopper/bellow and maybe a grind setting dial). At that point I could look at zero though.

Reaching out to try to crack the code on my resent insomnia or poor sleeping.
Very often I’m getting about 5 1/2 hours of sleep. 
I don’t know what’s going on. 

Has been going on now for about a month. 
I wake up sometime around 2 or 3am, and have a hard time getting back to sleep. Or I’m just restless. I’ll attach some screenshots but I’m skeptical if my Apple Watch is correct that I’m Sleeping because it often feels like I’m just laying there in bed wishing I could fall asleep.

I don’t feel super tired I don’t think. I’m more anxious that I’m not getting the recommended seven or eight hours of sleep. 

When I tracked my sleep years ago I seemed to average six hours and 15 minutes. 
So now I’m wondering if I’m that 1% that doesn’t need much…

I drink about 6oz of coffee added to my MUD/WTR every day as of August. 
Just got off nicotine last n the past few days. 
Might have an alpha nootropic pouch or two in the morning (as of October) but no stimulants in the afternoon. 
May or may not have a beer at 5 or 6pm (but have definitely tried no alcohol for several consecutive days to try to sleep better). 
I wear blue blocking glasses morning and evening, try to get morning sunrise in my eyes.
Switching to fresh 100% cotton sheets today and have also tried a grounding anklet for sleep.  Super dark rm. I crack a window but it’s on the other side of the room.  

Anyway, I’d love some insight if you have any. 

Like I said I feel fine but I’m a little concerned for my long term health that 5hrs is not enough. 

Thanks!",1,1762000481.0,sleep,1,1.0,False
1olmoaj,https://i.redd.it/n8vkifz81nyf1.png,What to watch next?,"I started watching anime series in my 30s, so I'm still new to this. I've watched only 12 series and dropped a bunch for different reasons. All of the series I've finished I liked quite a bit, I guess it's a luxury that I'm still new and I haven't had to watch anything mid yet.

I have only 1 request - no 100+ episodes long ones. And I dislike specific artstyles that I don't know how to call but you'll know what I mean when you check what I've watched :D No kawaii school girls with big shiny eyes and everyone with different colored hair, and no anthropomorphic furry stuff. I loved Heavenly Delusion but I was quite shocked about the furry character. It's fine when it's a minor thing but I was like ""just why?""...

I'll say a few words about my top5 and least favorite 1, so you get a better idea than just a tierlist:

1. **Frieren** is my absolute favorite one and I doubt I'll watch anything on its level for me, but that's okay. I watched Frieren a year after I lost someone special - I was in a similar phase of grief as Frieren, reliving past memories, feeling some regrets over not spending more time together, etc. I liked that Frieren is about grief without being about grief - it's not sad and depressing, it's melancholic and atmospheric. I wasn't a huge fan of the Academy Arc (eps 18-28), but I was okay with it.
2. **Chainsaw Man** was just plain fun for me - I liked the action scenes from quality of animation standpoint (I know some criticize the 3D aspect, but to my beginner eyes it was great), but I liked the chill scenes in between even more. I liked the cinematic feel, the muted colors, the coffee brewing scene. I liked the characters and relationships quite a bit - at first I was disgusted by Denji, but eventually I realized that the characterization was very intentional and his growth was huge - I loved how he gets unspoken revelations when he achieves his shallow goals. I loved the his dynamic with Power and her character in general - it was cool to see how 2 not great characters got tamed by Aki and how he got used to some wildness himself. I loved the gritty beginning with Denji's life of selling organs.
3. **Attack on Titan** \- it doesn't need an explanation really - I liked the worldbuilding, the mystery in the worldbuilding, the epicness in the scope, the high stakes and character deaths. I didn't love Season 3 but the rest was pretty good - it's a show that has extremely high highs and some pretty bad lows for me (it wasn't as engaging at times, I almost dropped it in season 3-4 even though I enjoyed them, especially the 4th one which is probably my favorite but it challenged my attention span).
4. **Dandadan** was anime I knew I won't vibe with because I'm not into school settings and this kind of shonen energy. And I'm still not into the whole aliens and yokai part, but Imust admit I really liked the relationships and Momo as a character. Eventually the aliens/yokai worldbuilding grew on me but it's still not the main reason I'll keep watching this one.
5. **Edgerunners** was the first one I watched and it was easy for me to get into it as a fan of the CP77 game. I liked that it explored more about cyberpsychosis than the game. I like that it's more mature, gritty, bleak. The story itself was kinda whatever tbh - I loved the beginning with David's mom though.

As I promised - what about my least favorite? I feel like I'll make some people angry, but it's **JJK**. I still gave it 7/10 which is an amazing rating. I didn't really watch any bad series. But JJK was the one that grabbed me the least. The characters weren't relatable for me (too old I guess, haha) and the story while it had some good moments was kinda whatever to me. I loved the animation quality, especially in Season 2, but it was too much action for me. At one point the action never stopped for like 5+ episodes and I was so bored by it, but the animation was so sick that I kept watching. I don't mind action as a fan of CSM, but I should care about the characters/story at least. I loved the JJK 0 movie fwiw. Great story, great characters.

Anime I dropped - **Steins;Gate** (I was told I dropped it too early at ep 14, might try again but not in 2025), **Apothecary Diaries** (didn't care about the whole court drama and politics, and was disgusted by Jinshi the entire time, watched like 18-19 eps), **Kowloon** (watched 8 eps out of 13, just couldn't do it, it was super boring for me), **Hell's Paradise** (didn't like the older historical setting, didn't connect with the main character), **Dungeon Meshi** (soft dropped it after 3 eps, not bingeable enough, not a fan of episodic stories without overarching stories), **Cowboy Bebop** (shocking, I know - I absolutely love the music, the artstyle, animation, but I found the episodic nature quite boring). I guess I really need the engaging overarching story because I've dropped half of these due to a more episodic nature (Apothecary, Dungeon Meshi, Cowboy)

[MAL](https://myanimelist.net/animelist/Abkenn?order=6&order2=4&status=2) for more - I've watched many movies from Ghibli (Mononoke being my favorite), Makoto Shinkai, and others. I love movies, but I couldn't get into anime series until 2022. I'm trying to find more series that I'll vibe with.",2,1762000432.0,AnimeReccomendations,44,0.57,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1olmmke,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyAnimals/comments/1olmmke/a_single_tylenol_tablet_kills_cats_one_lily_petal/,A single Tylenol tablet kills cats. One lily petal causes kidney failure. Here are some of the most dangerous household items for cats.,"**TL;DR: Your home contains numerous items that can kill your cat. A single 325 mg Tylenol tablet, one lily petal, or 1 to 2 teaspoons of antifreeze can be fatal. This guide covers the most dangerous items in four categories: foods, plants, chemicals/medicines, and household materials.** 

I've compiled comprehensive toxicology information after researching feline poisoning data. This is based on the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center (which receives over 451,000 calls annually), Pet Poison Helpline, and current veterinary consensus from 2023 to 2025.

**Why cats are uniquely vulnerable:**

Cats lack glucuronyl transferase, a critical liver enzyme that metabolizes many compounds safe for humans and dogs. This deficiency makes cats extraordinarily sensitive to acetaminophen, permethrin, NSAIDs, phenolic compounds in essential oils and cleaners, and many other substances. Combined with:

* Small body size (average 3 to 5 kg vs 10 to 30 kg for dogs)
* Meticulous grooming behavior that causes ingestion of topical toxins
* Curious nature that drives investigation of novel items
* Indoor confinement increasing exposure to household products

Cats face significantly higher poisoning risk than other pets. Understanding these dangers enables life-saving prevention and rapid response.

# TOP 10 TOXIC FOODS

# 1. Onions, Garlic, Chives, Leeks (All Allium Species)

No safe threshold exists for any member of the Allium family. These vegetables contain organosulfoxides (n-propyl disulfide, allyl disulfide) that cause oxidative damage to feline red blood cells. Garlic is 3 to 5 times more potent than onions, making even a single clove dangerous. As little as 5 g/kg of raw onions (less than one teaspoon of cooked onions) triggers hemolytic anemia. Cats are the most susceptible domestic species to Allium toxicity.

The toxic mechanism involves sulfur compounds penetrating red blood cells and denaturing hemoglobin, forming Heinz bodies visible on blood smears. The body recognizes these damaged cells and destroys them prematurely, causing life threatening anemia.

Even small repeated exposures cause cumulative toxicity, meaning leftover seasoned foods pose ongoing risk. All forms are equally dangerous: raw, cooked, dried, or powdered. Commonly found in baby food, broths, seasonings, and many prepared human foods.

* Toxic Dose: 5 g/kg (less than 1 teaspoon for average cat)
* Severity: Severe to life threatening
* Timeline: Symptoms 1 to 5 days after exposure

# 2. Grapes and Raisins

Recent veterinary research identified tartaric acid as the likely toxic agent causing acute kidney injury in cats. Toxicity proves remarkably unpredictable: as few as 4 to 5 grapes can trigger acute kidney damage. For a typical 5 kg cat, approximately 12 grapes or 30 raisins could prove toxic, but no safe amount exists since even single grapes have caused kidney damage in documented cases.

* Toxic Dose: Any amount potentially dangerous
* Severity: Life threatening
* Timeline: Kidney failure develops 24 to 72 hours post-ingestion
* Key Danger: Unpredictable toxicity, no safe threshold established

# 3. Chocolate (Especially Baker's and Dark)

All chocolate contains methylxanthines (theobromine and caffeine) that inhibit cellular phosphodiesterases and competitively block adenosine receptors, causing CNS stimulation and cardiac muscle overstimulation. The danger varies dramatically by type:

* Baker's chocolate: 14+ mg/g theobromine (just 7 grams causes toxicity in 5 kg cat)
* Dark chocolate: 5 mg/g
* Milk chocolate: 1.5 to 2.1 mg/g
* White chocolate: negligible amounts

Toxic doses begin at 20 mg/kg for mild symptoms (restlessness, vomiting), progress to 40 to 50 mg/kg for cardiotoxicity (tachycardia, arrhythmias), and reach seizure threshold at 60+ mg/kg. For reference, a 5 kg cat develops severe toxicity from 40 grams dark chocolate or 132 grams milk chocolate.

* Toxic Dose: 20 mg/kg mild, 40 to 50 mg/kg severe, 60+ mg/kg seizures
* Severity: Moderate to life threatening depending on type and amount
* Timeline: Symptoms 2 to 4 hours; effects persist 48 to 72 hours

# 4. Alcohol (All Forms)

Ethanol crosses the blood-brain barrier readily and inhibits NMDA glutamate receptors while reducing cGMP production, causing profound CNS depression. The minimal toxic dose of 5 to 8 mL/kg means even a tablespoon can poison cats, with symptoms appearing within 30 to 60 minutes.

Clinical signs include vomiting, severe ataxia, lethargy progressing to stupor, respiratory depression, hypothermia, and potentially fatal respiratory failure. For a 4 kg cat, just 10 mL of pure ethanol (equivalent to one shot of 40% vodka) can prove fatal.

Sources extend beyond beverages to include hand sanitizer, mouthwash, fermenting bread dough (which also causes gastric bloat), and rotten fruit. Treatment requires IV fluids, warming measures for hypothermia, dextrose for hypoglycemia, and respiratory support including potential mechanical ventilation. Most cats recover with aggressive supportive care, but outcome depends on amount consumed.

* Toxic Dose: 5 to 8 mL/kg (one shot vodka potentially fatal)
* Severity: Life threatening
* Timeline: Symptoms 30 to 60 minutes; effects last 12 to 24 hours
* Critical: Do NOT induce vomiting in CNS-depressed patients

# 5. Raw Yeast Dough

Unbaked dough presents unique dual dangers. Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolizes carbohydrates in the warm, moist stomach, producing both carbon dioxide gas (causing potentially life threatening gastric distension) and ethanol (causing alcohol toxicosis).

Symptoms appear within 1 to 2 hours: distended painful abdomen, unproductive retching, breathing difficulty from diaphragmatic pressure, plus all alcohol toxicity signs including ataxia, CNS depression, and hypothermia. The combination of mechanical obstruction (potential gastric rupture or volvulus) with ethanol poisoning makes this severe to life threatening.

* Toxic Dose: Any amount dangerous
* Severity: Severe to life threatening
* Timeline: Symptoms 1 to 2 hours post-ingestion

# 6. Xylitol (Artificial Sweetener)

A critical update to veterinary toxicology: While xylitol causes profound hypoglycemia and liver failure in dogs at doses as low as 0.03 g/kg, 2018 research published in Journal of Veterinary Pharmacology and Therapeutics found cats given up to 1,000 mg/kg showed no hypoglycemia and even slight blood glucose increases (the opposite of dogs).

To date, no confirmed cases of feline xylitol toxicity have been reported to ASPCA APCC or Pet Poison Helpline. The mechanism differs: cats do not release excessive insulin in response to xylitol ingestion. However, veterinarians recommend continued caution due to small study sample size (6 cats) and possibility of idiosyncratic reactions.

This represents an evolving consensus where cats appear significantly less vulnerable than dogs to this artificial sweetener found in sugar-free gum, candy, peanut butter, baked goods, toothpaste, and medications.

* Toxic Dose: Unknown safe threshold; appears less toxic to cats than dogs
* Severity: Moderate to severe but fewer documented cases in cats
* Note: Veterinary consensus evolving based on 2018 research

# 7. Salt (Sodium Chloride)

Sodium chloride toxicity occurs at approximately 4 g/kg (roughly 20 grams for a 5 kg cat, or about 3 teaspoons of table salt). Sources include table salt, rock salt, salt dough ornaments, homemade play dough, ocean water, and heavily salted human foods. The danger intensifies without water access, as hypernatremia draws water from cells into bloodstream, causing cellular dehydration especially in brain tissue.

Symptoms appear 1 to 4 hours after large ingestions: excessive thirst and urination initially, then vomiting, lethargy, weakness, muscle tremors, seizures, coma, and death if untreated.

* Toxic Dose: 4 g/kg lethal (approximately 20 grams for 5 kg cat)
* Severity: Moderate to life threatening
* Timeline: Symptoms 1 to 4 hours; correction requires 48 to 72 hours
* Critical: Slow correction essential to prevent cerebral edema

# 8. Raw Fish (Certain Species)

Thiaminase enzyme in certain raw fish (carp, herring, smelt, catfish) destroys vitamin B1, while raw meat harbors pathogens including Salmonella, E. coli, Campylobacter, and parasites like Toxoplasma.

Thiamine deficiency develops chronically over weeks to months of raw fish feeding, causing progressive neurological dysfunction: anorexia, ataxia, seizures, dilated pupils, ventroflexion of the neck (classic sign where neck bends toward ground), progressing to coma if untreated. Clinical deficiency develops in just 23 to 40 days on raw fish diets.

* Toxic Dose: Chronic exposure (weeks to months of raw fish diet)
* Severity: Severe to life threatening if untreated
* Timeline: Deficiency develops 23 to 40 days; permanent neurological damage possible

# 9. Caffeine (Coffee, Tea, Energy Drinks)

Caffeine, a methylxanthine like theobromine in chocolate, causes toxicity beginning at 9 mg/kg (mild symptoms), 14 mg/kg (moderate to severe), and 20 to 27 mg/kg (dangerous reactions potentially deadly). For a 5 kg cat, 70 mg caffeine reaches moderate toxicity threshold (approximately equivalent to one strong cup of coffee or 1 to 2 cups of tea).

Energy drinks prove particularly hazardous, containing 80 to 300+ mg per serving plus additional stimulants like guarana that potentiate effects. Single coffee beans swallowed whole (1 to 10 mg each) generally prove non-dangerous, but crushed beans, ground coffee, caffeine pills, and energy drinks contain concentrated amounts.

* Toxic Dose: 9 mg/kg mild, 14 mg/kg moderate, 20 to 27 mg/kg dangerous
* Severity: Moderate to life threatening
* Timeline: Symptoms 30 to 60 minutes; effects 12 to 48 hours

# 10. Macadamia Nuts

Macadamia nuts contain an unknown toxic principle affecting the nervous system, well documented in dogs at 0.7 to 2.2 g/kg but less studied in cats. Symptoms appear within 3 to 12 hours including weakness (especially hind limbs), ataxia with ""drunken"" appearance, lethargy, vomiting, tremors, and hyperthermia.

The exceptionally high fat content across all nuts (macadamia, almond, walnut, pecan) causes pancreatitis with severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, dehydration, and fever. Moldy walnuts and pecans containing tremorgenic mycotoxins prove highly toxic, causing tremors, seizures, hyperthermia, rapid breathing, and potentially death.

* Toxic Dose: Unknown in cats (extrapolated from dog data: 0.7 to 2.2 g/kg)
* Severity: Moderate to severe; moldy nuts severe to life threatening
* Timeline: Symptoms 3 to 12 hours post-ingestion



# TOP 10 HOUSEHOLD PLANTS

# 1. True Lilies (Lilium and Hemerocallis Species)

Lilium and Hemerocallis species (including Easter, Tiger, Asiatic, Stargazer, and Day lilies) contain an unidentified water-soluble nephrotoxin that causes acute tubular necrosis exclusively in cats. Dogs and other animals remain unaffected, making this a species-specific toxicity mystery despite 20+ years of research.

All plant parts are lethal: leaves, petals, stamens, pollen, stems, bulbs, and even vase water. The threshold is terrifyingly low: 1 to 2 leaves or petals can be fatal; licking pollen off fur causes kidney failure.

* Toxic Parts: ALL parts including pollen and vase water
* Toxic Dose: 1 to 2 petals can be fatal
* Severity: LIFE THREATENING (50% mortality even with treatment)
* Timeline: Must treat within 6 to 18 hours for best outcomes
* IMPORTANT: ""Peace Lily"" (Spathiphyllum) is NOT a true lily and does NOT cause kidney failure

# 2. Sago Palm (Cycas revoluta)

Cycas revoluta and related cycads contain cycasin (a glycoside metabolized to methylazoxymethanol) that causes severe hepatotoxicity and hepatocellular necrosis. All parts are toxic, with seeds/nuts most dangerous due to highest concentration. The bright orange-red seeds attract curious cats, and ingestion of just 1 to 2 seeds can be fatal.

* Toxic Parts: ALL parts, seeds most concentrated
* Toxic Dose: 1 to 2 seeds potentially fatal
* Severity: LIFE THREATENING (50% survival with treatment)
* Timeline: Liver failure 2 to 3 days; death 3 to 7 days

# 3. Oleander (Nerium oleander)

Oleander contains cardiac glycosides including oleandrin that inhibit the sodium-potassium pump in cardiac cells. A single oleander leaf can prove deadly. All plant parts including flowers, stems, leaves, roots, and even water containing these plants pose extreme danger.

Symptoms include severe vomiting, diarrhea, profound drooling, dangerous cardiac arrhythmias (especially bradycardia), abnormal heart function, hypothermia, tremors, collapse, and death. Blood work reveals hyperkalemia. This life-threatening toxicity carries high mortality rates, with oleander capable of causing fatal cardiac arrest within hours.

* Toxic Parts: ALL parts (leaves, flowers, stems, roots, water)
* Toxic Dose: Single leaf potentially fatal
* Severity: LIFE THREATENING (high mortality)
* Timeline: Cardiac arrest possible within hours

# 4. Azaleas and Rhododendrons (Rhododendron species)

Rhododendron species (over 1,000 species in Ericaceae family) contain grayanotoxins that bind to sodium channels in cell membranes, preventing channel inactivation and maintaining excitable tissues in continuous depolarization. This disrupts normal cardiac rhythm, nerve function, and muscle function. All parts are toxic, especially leaves and flowers, with leaves remaining toxic when dried.

Toxic threshold is low: as few as 3 leaves may be lethal. Small amounts cause mild GI signs; larger ingestions produce moderate to severe effects including life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias.

Symptoms appear 20 minutes to 2 hours post-ingestion: burning mouth sensation, drooling, vomiting, diarrhea, progressing to weakness, depression, abdominal pain, and muscular weakness. Cardiac effects include bradycardia, abnormal rhythms, and hypotension. Severe cases develop breathing difficulty, tremors, seizures, blindness, coma, and death within 1 to 2 days.

* Toxic Parts: ALL parts, especially leaves and flowers
* Toxic Dose: 2 to 3 leaves potentially lethal
* Severity: Severe to life threatening
* Timeline: Symptoms 20 minutes to 2 hours; effects last 1 to 5 days

# 5. Autumn Crocus (Colchicum autumnale)

Autumn crocus contains colchicine disrupting cell division, causing oral irritation, bloody vomiting and diarrhea, gastrointestinal bleeding, shock, multi-organ damage, bone marrow suppression, respiratory failure, and seizures (potentially days after ingestion). All parts are toxic with highest concentration in bulbs and flowers.

* Toxic Parts: ALL parts (highest in bulbs and flowers)
* Toxic Dose: Small amounts dangerous
* Severity: LIFE THREATENING
* Timeline: Symptoms can be delayed days

# 6. Kalanchoe (Kalanchoe species)

Kalanchoe species contain bufadienolides (cardiac glycosides similar to digitalis that inhibit Na+/K+ ATPase pump), increasing intracellular calcium in cardiac muscle and disrupting normal rhythm. Common succulent with moderate to life-threatening toxicity.

Symptoms begin at 2 to 4 hours: vomiting, diarrhea, drooling, then cardiac effects including abnormal rhythms, and critically—life threatening hyperkalemia (elevated potassium) that can cause sudden cardiac arrest.

* Toxic Parts: ALL parts
* Toxic Dose: Small amounts cause toxicity
* Severity: Moderate to life threatening
* Timeline: Cardiac effects 2 to 4 hours

# 7. Dieffenbachia (Dumb Cane)

Dieffenbachia belongs to Araceae family and contains insoluble calcium oxalate crystals called raphides (needle-like bundles that mechanically penetrate and embed in oral mucosa). These crystals are coated with proteolytic enzymes that trigger histamine and bradykinin release, causing immediate tissue inflammation and severe pain.

The mechanism is physical rather than systemic: crystals cause local tissue damage without organ involvement or absorption, making these plants mild to moderate in severity and self-limiting. Symptoms appear within minutes to 4 hours: intense burning mouth pain, profuse drooling, pawing at face, oral ulceration, swelling of lips/tongue/throat.

* Toxic Parts: ALL parts
* Toxic Dose: Any amount causes pain
* Severity: Mild to moderate (rarely severe with airway swelling)
* Timeline: Immediate (minutes) to 4 hours

# 8. Pothos / Devil's Ivy (Epipremnum aureum)

Pothos, also called Devil's Ivy, is an extremely popular houseplant containing insoluble calcium oxalate crystals causing painful mouth injury. Generally self-limiting but very common exposure due to how popular this plant is. Among the most commonly kept houseplants.

Symptoms are immediate: intense oral pain, profuse drooling, pawing at mouth, oral ulceration. Most cases resolve within 24 hours without lasting effects.

* Toxic Parts: ALL parts
* Toxic Dose: Any amount causes irritation
* Severity: Mild to moderate (self-limiting)
* Timeline: Immediate oral pain

# 9. Amaryllis (Hippeastrum species)

Amaryllis (Hippeastrum species) contains phenanthridine alkaloids including lycorine and galanthamine, plus raphide oxalate crystals in bulbs. Popular holiday gift plant (Christmas, Easter). Bulbs are most toxic and commonly exposed during holiday gifting.

Symptoms begin immediately with bulb contact (oral pain, drooling, pawing), progressing to GI effects at 2 to 4 hours (vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain), depression, tremors, hypotension, and potentially cardiac arrhythmias or seizures in severe cases.

* Toxic Parts: ALL parts, bulbs most concentrated
* Toxic Dose: Bulb ingestion most dangerous
* Severity: Moderate to severe
* Timeline: Immediate mouth pain, GI 2 to 4 hours, cardiac possible

# 10. Tulips (Tulipa species)

Tulipa species contain tulipalin A and B (allergenic lactones), alkaloids, and glycosides that cause gastrointestinal irritation. All parts are toxic, but bulbs contain highest concentration and cause moderate to severe toxicity. Leaves and flowers produce mild effects, while large chunks of bulbs can cause both severe symptoms and intestinal obstruction.

Important distinction: Related to deadly true lilies but MUCH less toxic. While both are in Liliaceae family, tulips do not cause kidney failure. They remain common spring flowers and gift plants, requiring vigilance but less absolute prohibition than true lilies.

* Toxic Parts: ALL parts, bulbs highest concentration
* Toxic Dose: Bulbs cause severe symptoms
* Severity: Mild (flowers/leaves) to severe (bulbs)
* Timeline: GI symptoms 2 to 4 hours



# TOP 9 CHEMICALS AND MEDICINES

# 1. Acetaminophen / Tylenol (Paracetamol)

A single 325 mg Tylenol tablet can kill a cat. Feline deficiency in glucuronyl transferase (the enzyme essential for safe acetaminophen metabolism) makes cats extraordinarily vulnerable to this ubiquitous pain reliever found in over 200 products. The toxic dose of 10 to 50 mg/kg means even 10 mg/kg has caused death, and one extra-strength 500 mg tablet is highly lethal to an average cat.

The mechanism involves toxic metabolite N-acetyl-para-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI), which depletes glutathione stores and binds to hepatocyte membranes causing liver necrosis. Simultaneously, NAPQI causes severe oxidative damage to hemoglobin, converting it to methemoglobin that cannot carry oxygen, forming Heinz bodies and triggering hemolytic anemia.

* Toxic Dose: 10 to 50 mg/kg (death documented at 10 mg/kg)
* Severity: LIFE THREATENING
* Timeline: Symptoms 1 to 4 hours; liver failure 24 to 72 hours
* Found in: 200+ products
* Critical: Must treat BEFORE symptoms appear

# 2. Permethrin (Dog Flea/Tick Products)

Dog spot-on flea and tick products containing 44 to 65% permethrin (K9 Advantix, Zodiac, Sergeant's, Hartz) cause severe to life threatening toxicity in cats within minutes to hours of exposure. Synthetic pyrethroid insecticides delay closure of voltage-gated sodium channels in nerve cells, causing prolonged depolarization and repetitive nerve firing while inhibiting GABA receptors.

Cats are deficient in both glucuronidase transferase and ester hydrolysis needed for pyrethroid metabolism, causing toxic accumulation. Toxic dose: 100 mg/kg (1 mL of 45% permethrin in 4.5 kg cat) is life threatening; some cats react to single drops. Products labeled for cats contain less than 1% permethrin (generally safe); dog products are deadly to cats.

Symptoms appear within minutes to 3 hours: profuse drooling, agitation, hyperesthesia (extreme sensitivity to touch); muscle fasciculations and tremors at 1 to 12 hours (ear twitching progressing to whole body); generalized seizures, hyperthermia (up to 106°F), respiratory distress in severe cases. 

* Toxic Dose: Drops can be fatal; 100 mg/kg life threatening
* Severity: LIFE THREATENING (10 to 40% mortality despite treatment)
* Timeline: Minutes to 3 hours (seizures, tremors)
* Products: K9 Advantix, Zodiac, Sergeant's, Hartz DOG products
* Critical: Control seizures BEFORE bathing

# 3. Ethylene Glycol (Antifreeze)

Antifreeze (95 to 97% ethylene glycol) is almost universally fatal without immediate treatment. For cats, 1 to 2 teaspoons (5 to 10 mL) is lethal. The minimum dose of 1.4 mL/kg means cats are twice as sensitive as dogs. Windshield de-icers, brake fluid, hydraulic fluid, paints, and solvents also contain this sweet-tasting toxin that cats absorb rapidly, even through skin.

Metabolism by liver alcohol dehydrogenase produces toxic metabolites: glycolaldehyde, glycolic acid (causes metabolic acidosis), glyoxylic acid, oxalic acid. Oxalic acid binds serum calcium forming calcium oxalate crystals that deposit in renal tubules, causing mechanical obstruction and tubular necrosis plus CNS depression.

Clinical progression follows three stages:

* Toxic Dose: 1.4 mL/kg (cats twice as sensitive as dogs)
* Severity: LIFE THREATENING (nearly 100% fatal without early treatment)
* Timeline: 3 stages over 12 to 24 hours; kidney failure by 12 to 24 hours in cats
* Critical: MUST treat within 3 hours or antidote fails

# 4. NSAIDs (Ibuprofen, Naproxen, Aspirin)

Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve) inhibit cyclooxygenase enzymes, blocking prostaglandin synthesis. Since prostaglandins protect gastric mucosa, regulate renal blood flow, and support platelet function, their loss causes gastric ulceration and renal ischemia. Cats metabolize NSAIDs twice as slowly as dogs due to limited glucuronidation, making them twice as sensitive.

One 200 mg ibuprofen tablet causes toxicity in an average cat. Toxic doses: 50 mg/kg causes gastric ulcers; greater than 100 mg/kg causes kidney damage; greater than 400 mg/kg causes seizures, tremors, and coma. Naproxen is even more toxic than ibuprofen.

Symptoms appear 2 to 6 hours (vomiting, abdominal pain, anorexia, lethargy); gastric ulceration at 12 to 24 hours (bloody vomit, black tarry stools); acute kidney failure at 24 to 72 hours (increased thirst/urination or no urination, dehydration); liver damage and jaundice at 3 to 5 days.

* Toxic Dose: 50 mg/kg gastric ulcers; greater than 100 mg/kg kidney damage
* Severity: Severe to life threatening
* Timeline: GI symptoms 2 to 6 hours; kidney failure 24 to 72 hours
* Brands: Advil, Motrin, Aleve (extremely common)

# 5. Essential Oils (Tea Tree, Pennyroyal, Wintergreen, Pine, Citrus)

Tea tree oil, pennyroyal, wintergreen, pine, citrus oils contain terpenes, ketones, and phenolic compounds that cats cannot efficiently metabolize due to glucuronidation deficiency. A single drop of concentrated tea tree oil can cause toxicity.

Rapid dermal and oral absorption leads to hepatotoxicity from toxic metabolites and CNS depression. Symptoms appear minutes to 2 hours: drooling, oral pain; depression, hypothermia, ataxia, tremors at 2 to 8 hours; liver injury (elevated enzymes) at 8 to 24 hours. Dermal exposure causes skin redness and irritation.

Vulnerability stems from grooming causing ingestion of topically applied oils, deficient glucuronidation of phenolic compounds, prolonged elimination half-life, and increasing use of essential oil diffusers in homes.

* Toxic Dose: Drops to small amounts depending on oil
* Severity: Moderate to life threatening
* Timeline: Minutes to 2 hours (symptoms); liver injury 8 to 24 hours
* Key Danger: Absorbed through skin and inhaled from diffusers

# 6. Household Cleaners (Bleach, Toilet Bowl Cleaners, Drain Cleaners)

Toilet bowl cleaners (pH greater than 11), drain cleaners (sodium hydroxide, sulfuric acid), bleach/sodium hypochlorite (3 to 10% household; up to 70% pool treatments), Pine-Sol, Lysol (phenol-containing), and laundry detergent pods contain corrosive substances and phenols. Cats lack ability to glucuronidate phenols efficiently, and grooming behavior causes ingestion of products from fur.

Mechanism: Corrosive alkaline (pH greater than 11) or acidic (pH less than 3.5) products cause chemical burns; phenols are directly absorbed through skin causing hepatotoxicity; cationic detergents cause direct mucosal damage.

Concentrated products cause burns from small lick or contact; bleach at less than 10% is relatively safe but greater than 10% or pH greater than 11 causes corrosive injury; phenols are toxic even at dilute concentrations through dermal absorption.

Symptoms appear immediately to 3 hours: drooling, oral pain, vomiting, breathing difficulty. Corrosive products cause chemical burns to mouth, esophagus, stomach (oral ulcers, difficulty swallowing). Phenol exposure causes depression, hypothermia, dark urine, liver damage at 24 to 48 hours.

* Toxic Dose: Concentrated products: small lick dangerous; bleach greater than 10% corrosive
* Severity: Mild to severe depending on pH and concentration
* Timeline: Immediate burns; phenol liver damage 24 to 48 hours

# 7. Rodenticides (Multiple Types)

Anticoagulants (brodifacoum, bromadiolone, warfarin), cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3), and bromethalin represent three distinct rodenticide mechanisms.

Anticoagulants inhibit vitamin K epoxide reductase, preventing activation of clotting factors II, VII, IX, X, causing coagulopathy at 2 to 7 days post-ingestion: lethargy, pale gums, bleeding (nosebleeds, blood in urine, black stools, bloody vomit), breathing difficulty from thoracic bleeding. Second-generation anticoagulants like brodifacoum are extremely potent (single feeding can be toxic).

Cholecalciferol causes hypercalcemia leading to soft tissue mineralization and kidney damage at 12 to 36 hours: excessive thirst/urination, vomiting, anorexia, acute kidney failure.

Bromethalin uncouples oxidative phosphorylation causing cerebral edema at 2 to 7 days: hyperexcitability, tremors, seizures, posterior paresis, CNS depression.

Cats face secondary poisoning from eating poisoned rodents, direct bait ingestion, and exposure to baits often containing attractants.

* Toxic Dose: Single feeding with second-generation anticoagulants
* Severity: Severe to fatal (all types)
* Timeline: 2 to 7 days for symptoms depending on type
* Key Danger: Secondary poisoning from eating poisoned rodents

# 8. ADHD Stimulants (Adderall, Vyvanse, Ritalin, Concerta)

Adderall (amphetamine/dextroamphetamine), Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine), Concerta (methylphenidate), and Ritalin increase release and block reuptake of dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine, causing severe CNS and cardiovascular stimulation. Some cats are attracted to Adderall tablet coating.

One 10 to 30 mg tablet can cause severe toxicity in an average cat; toxic dose is 1 to 5 mg/kg for clinical signs, greater than 10 mg/kg for severe toxicity. Symptoms appear 30 minutes to 2 hours: hyperactivity, agitation, vocalization; rapid heart rate, high blood pressure, hyperthermia, dilated pupils at 1 to 4 hours. Severe cases develop tremors, seizures, potentially fatal arrhythmias, collapse. Extended-release formulations last 8 to 12 hours.

* Toxic Dose: 1 to 5 mg/kg clinical signs; greater than 10 mg/kg severe
* Severity: Severe to life threatening
* Timeline: 30 minutes to 2 hours; effects last 8 to 12 hours
* Key Danger: Common in households; attractive coating; no antidote

# 9. Antidepressants (Effexor, Cymbalta, Prozac, Zoloft)

Effexor (venlafaxine), Cymbalta (duloxetine), Prozac (fluoxetine), and Zoloft (sertraline) (SSRIs and SNRIs commonly prescribed for human depression) cause moderate to severe toxicity in cats. Notably, cats are attracted to Effexor due to appealing smell/flavor in tablet coating.

These drugs cause excessive serotonin and norepinephrine in synaptic cleft, resulting in serotonin syndrome: CNS and cardiovascular overstimulation. Even 1 to 2 tablets can cause serious toxicity; therapeutic doses in cats can trigger moderate to severe signs.

* Toxic Dose: 1 to 2 tablets can cause serious toxicity
* Severity: Moderate to severe
* Timeline: 1 to 4 hours; effects last 12 to 48 hours
* Key Danger: Effexor attraction; serotonin syndrome has specific antidote (cyproheptadine)

# TOP 9 HOUSEHOLD MATERIALS AND ITEMS

# 1. Linear Foreign Bodies (String, Yarn, Tinsel, Ribbon, Thread, Dental Floss)

String, yarn, tinsel, ribbon, thread, dental floss, Easter grass, and fabric strips represent the number 1 physical obstruction danger for cats due to unique anatomy: backward-facing papillae (barbs) on feline tongues prevent spitting out string once swallowing begins.

String commonly anchors under the tongue or at stomach pylorus while trailing through GI tract, causing intestines to ""pleat"" or bunch up like an accordion. The back-and-forth sawing motion cuts through intestinal walls, causing perforation, necrosis, peritonitis, and sepsis. Any amount is dangerous; even 6 to 12 inches can be life threatening.

* Toxic Dose: Any amount (even 6 to 12 inches life threatening)
* Severity: LIFE THREATENING
* Timeline: Hours to days
* Critical: NEVER pull on string protruding from either end

# 2. Batteries (Lithium Disc, Button, Alkaline)

Button/disc batteries, alkaline batteries (AA, AAA, D, C), lithium batteries, hearing aid batteries, and watch batteries deliver dual dangers: chemical burns from alkaline contents (potassium or sodium hydroxide) and heavy metal toxicity (zinc, lead, mercury, lithium, silver, cadmium).

Lithium disc batteries are most dangerous, causing tissue necrosis within 15 minutes if lodged in esophagus. Battery contents corrode tissues on contact; electrochemical burns occur when battery contacts moist tissue. Small size allows batteries to lodge in esophagus. ANY battery ingestion is emergency.

* Toxic Dose: ANY battery ingestion is emergency
* Severity: Severe to life threatening
* Timeline: 15 minutes (lithium burns) to hours
* Critical: Must remove lithium batteries within 15 minutes if lodged

# 3. Expanding Adhesives (Gorilla Glue, Construction Glues)

Gorilla Glue (Original), construction adhesives, wood glues containing diisocyanates (MDI), Loctite Probond, Elmer's Probond, high-strength expanding glues are NOT chemically toxic but cause physical obstruction. Diisocyanates expand dramatically when mixed with moisture/stomach acid, forming hard foam-like foreign body mass that can fill entire stomach capacity, potentially causing rupture.

Smaller stomach capacity means less required for complete obstruction. Even ""one pea-sized lick"" is problematic in cats; 1 to 2 licks may cause obstruction in medium-sized cats. Expansion occurs within 3 to 12 hours; obstruction evident within 12 to 24 hours. Dried glue is not dangerous (only wet glue expands).

* Toxic Dose: 1 to 2 licks may cause obstruction
* Severity: LIFE THREATENING (requires surgery)
* Timeline: Expansion 3 to 12 hours; obstruction 12 to 24 hours
* Critical: Can cause gastric rupture; only WET glue expands (dried glue safe)

# 4. Iron Oxygen Absorbers (Food Packaging)

Iron-containing oxygen absorbers found in food packaging (beef jerky, pet treats, dehydrated foods, packaged foods), labeled ""DO NOT EAT,"" contain elemental iron granules (up to 50% elemental iron) that are very corrosive to GI tract, cause severe metabolic acidosis, and deliver hepatic toxicity through direct tissue damage.

* Toxic Dose: Greater than 60 mg/kg causes severe toxicity
* Severity: Severe to life threatening
* Timeline: 3 stages over 5 days (Stage 2 ""apparent recovery"" is misleading)
* Important: Silica gel packets are NON-TOXIC (iron absorbers are magnetic)

# 5. Fabric Softener Sheets (Dryer Sheets)

Dryer sheets (used or unused) and liquid fabric softener contain cationic detergents, benzyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, camphor, and chloroform (in some products). Synthetic materials don't break down in GI tract causing obstruction risk; chemicals cause corrosive burns; residue left on fabrics transfers to cats.

MORE DANGEROUS TO CATS THAN DOGS due to grooming behavior—cats lick fur constantly, spreading chemicals over entire body. More sensitive to cationic detergents; attracted to static cling/""crinkly"" texture; warm laundry is appealing. Even used dryer sheets are dangerous. Contact with fur plus grooming equals ingestion.

* Toxic Dose: Contact exposure plus grooming equals toxicity
* Severity: Moderate to severe
* Timeline: Minutes to hours after contact
* Critical: Internet tip to use for pet hair removal is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS

# 6. Essential Oil Diffusers (All Types)

Nebulizing diffusers, ultrasonic diffusers, heat diffusers, reed diffusers, and liquid potpourri simmer pots release concentrated essential oils containing terpenes, ketones, and phenols that cats cannot metabolize. Cats lack glucuronyl transferase enzyme in liver necessary to metabolize these compounds, causing hepatotoxicity, chemical burns, and respiratory irritation.

Most toxic essential oils: tea tree (melaleuca), pennyroyal, wintergreen, pine, peppermint, citrus, cinnamon, sweet birch, ylang ylang. ""A few licks"" of liquid potpourri cause severe burns; small amounts on skin are toxic; inhalation of concentrated vapors is dangerous.

* Toxic Dose: Inhalation exposure accumulates; direct contact highly toxic
* Severity: Moderate to severe
* Timeline: Minutes (liquid potpourri burns) to hours (essential oil toxicity)
* Key Danger: Continuous exposure in enclosed spaces; liquid potpourri especially dangerous

# 7. Laundry Detergent Pods

Concentrated cationic detergents in small, appealing packages. Cause direct mucosal damage and systemic toxicity. More dangerous than liquid detergent due to concentration and attractive appearance.

* Toxic Dose: Single pod dangerous
* Severity: Moderate to severe
* Timeline: Immediate to 3 hours
* Key Danger: Attractive appearance; highly concentrated

# 8. Glow Sticks / Glow Jewelry

Glow sticks, glow necklaces, glow bracelets, and light sticks contain dibutyl phthalate (an extremely bitter tasting chemical that is NOT highly toxic systemically but causes severe oral irritation and minor corrosive effects).

Cats are attracted to playing with dangling glow jewelry and bite into them during play. Extremely bitter taste causes dramatic reaction; bitterness makes cats groom excessively, spreading it. Generally low toxicity; symptoms related to bitter taste and mild irritation; most exposures can be managed at home.

* Toxic Dose: Generally low toxicity despite dramatic symptoms
* Severity: MILD (dramatic but not life threatening)
* Timeline: Immediate upon biting
* Key Point: Profuse drooling/foaming looks scary but usually resolves; most can be managed at home

# 9. Mothballs (Naphthalene or Paradichlorobenzene)

Both types toxic. Naphthalene causes hemolytic anemia. Paradichlorobenzene causes liver/kidney damage. Strong odor usually deters cats but curious cats investigate. Found in stored clothing and closets.

* Toxic Dose: 1 to 2 mothballs can cause toxicity
* Severity: Moderate to severe
* Timeline: Hours to days
* Key Difference: Naphthalene more toxic than paradichlorobenzene

# Call Emergency Vet Immediately For:

* Any lily exposure
* Antifreeze ingestion
* Battery ingestion
* Linear foreign body suspected
* Acetaminophen/Tylenol
* Liquid potpourri exposure
* Expanding glue ingestion
* Permethrin exposure with tremors/seizures
* Difficulty breathing
* Seizures
* Collapse

# What NOT to Do at Home

* Do NOT induce vomiting with hydrogen peroxide (damages cat esophagus)
* Do NOT induce vomiting with salt (causes toxicity)
* Do NOT give milk as antidote (ineffective)
* Do NOT pull on string protruding from rectum (causes internal damage)
* Do NOT induce vomiting with corrosive substances (liquid potpourri, cleaners)
* Do NOT give water/food after expanding glue ingestion (causes expansion)

# Why Cats Are Uniquely Vulnerable

1. Enzyme deficiency: Lack glucuronyl transferase for metabolizing acetaminophen, permethrin, NSAIDs, phenols, essential oils
2. Small body size: 3 to 5 kg average means lower absolute toxic doses
3. Grooming behavior: Constantly licking fur causes ingestion of topical toxins
4. Curious nature: Investigate novel items, play with string/ribbon
5. Indoor confinement: Increased exposure to household products
6. Obligate carnivore metabolism: Different enzyme systems than omnivores



# PREVENTION CHECKLIST

# Foods

* Store all human food securely
* Never feed table scraps with onions, garlic, grapes
* Check all ingredient labels
* Secure trash cans with locking lids
* No chocolate accessible
* Store alcohol and hand sanitizer out of reach

# Plants

* ELIMINATE ALL LILIES from home/yard
* Remove or elevate all toxic plants
* Check all floral arrangements before accepting
* Provide cat grass as safe alternative
* Warn gift givers about plant dangers

# Chemicals/Medicines

* Store ALL medications in locked cabinets
* Never leave pills on counters
* Use only cat-specific flea/tick products
* NEVER use dog flea products on or near cats
* Eliminate essential oil diffusers or use only in inaccessible rooms
* Lock cleaning products in cabinets
* Wipe up spills immediately

# Household Materials

* Secure all string, yarn, ribbon, tinsel, thread
* Store craft/sewing supplies in closed containers
* Check for dropped batteries immediately
* Store glues in secure locations
* Keep laundry products locked up
* No pennies accessible (especially post-1982)
* Dispose of food packaging with oxygen absorbers properly
* Remove dryer sheets from laundry immediately

# Emergency Preparedness

* Post emergency vet number on refrigerator
* Program poison control numbers in phone
* Know location of nearest 24-hour emergency clinic
* Keep pet carrier accessible
* Have Dawn dish soap available (for emergency bathing)
* Know your cat's weight (for toxicity calculations)

# FINAL CRITICAL REMINDERS

Cats are NOT small dogs. Their metabolism differs fundamentally. ""Safe"" for dogs or humans may be lethal for cats.

Time is critical. Most poisonings require intervention within 1 to 4 hours for best outcomes. Don't ""wait and see.""

No safe home remedies exist. Never induce vomiting or give ""antidotes"" without veterinary guidance.

Prevention is paramount. Most poisonings are preventable through environmental management.

When in doubt, call. It's better to call about a non-emergency than delay with a true emergency.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1olmlni,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1olmlni/my_boyfriend_is_being_too_friendly_with_other/,My boyfriend is being too friendly with other women,"I (26 F) sometimes worry that my boyfriend (27M) of more than a year is being too friendly with other women.

My boyfriend has a lot of female friends even before we started dating and im really totally fine with it. I dont really know some of them and how they became friends so i cant gauge the relationship.

Early on the relationship, he went out to have a coffee with a female friend to catch up. I was okay with it but i was weirded out because after their meeting, i felt like he was overcompensating by being too sweet.

Also, we once had a fight over a photobooth picture of him and a girl displayed in his room because when i first asked him who the girl was, he said she was a friend from manila. I found out from his cousin that he actually courted her before but he got turned down by the girl. He even sent her flowers on her graduation and mind you, we’re from visayas. We talked about it and he took down the picture. However, when he went to manila for a conference, he told me that he will be having coffee with this girl, alone. To which i told him that I would be uncomfy. He cancelled their meet up but the trust i have with him diminished.

Another one, his nephew’s female teacher was his mom’s student and thats how he knew her. I found out last night that they would randomly send videos or pics of his nephew/her student doing things a kid would do.  Just last night during a social event, he was videocalling the teacher showing his nephew and having a little catch up. We talked about it and i told him that he should have boundaries now that he is in a relationship.

TL;DR my boyfriend is being too friendly with other women and im not comfortable with it. Now, im overthinking things and its taking a toll on my mental health. Whats the best thing to do?

The Ashen witch in Ashes Ruins !

Elaina has arrived in a city ruins full of ashes (How fitting of her epitaph, even full in ashes, she’s still beautiful) ok, enough simping haha.

Mirarose was supposed to have a red hair in the light novel, but in the anime she has a wavy black hair (don’t know why they changed her hair, should’ve keep it red to be honest)

First time in the anime we see Elaina drinking tea ! (Elaina likes coffee, personally I prefer tea myself haha)

Elaina sleeping (cutest scene in the episode !) 

Mirarose made some breads for breakfast (reminds me of Yakitate Japan ! Does anyone know this anime ? It’s a 22 years old anime about making bread basically) so satisfying watching Elaina’s beautiful hands tearing the bread (Alright, that’s enough simping lmao) seems like she learned how to baked from her deceased lover.

Elaina using her magic to control some (dead) kids’s toys (so cute !) we see Elaina using a lot magic this Episode, I like it ! (She can basically do almost anything really haha)

Mirarose vs Dragon ! (Actually, it’s not a dragon, it looks like some mix between centipede and dragon, so, let’s call it Centigon haha) but it has actual name by the way lol.

Mirarose magic color has red aura to it (well, she’s supposed to have red hair) Elaina magic is white/grey because her hair is grey, but Saya magic isn’t black colored, so maybe that’s not how it works lmao. 

Mirarose-san is super strong, she definitely wants to murder that Centigon (Jabaliye by the way) witches are so scary when they’re angry ! (Elaina is the same haha)

Mirarose backstory is quite messed up and it seems like she kinda went crazy after she gained her memories back (Well, another sad story….)

This episode is darker than Ep 3, but in my opinion, the tones doesn’t feel as sad as Ep 3 for some reason to me. (Maybe because Ep 3 had 2 story ?)

I am very attracted to him but in my head i was thinking yeah but does he love Jesus? I kid you not, right after that he started playing worship music in his garage and i was like whoa wait that’s crazy. 

So a couple of more run ins later, he asked me what i was doing for Halloween and he said he didn’t want to go and party because it felt spiritually dark so he was going to go to a family friendly thing and then we just started talking about the Bible, community, discipleship and the Holy Spirit, like this man started bringing all of this up on his own. We have very similar views about church. 

So i took a shot and said hey i should give u my number, maybe we can grab coffee sometime. I usually never do that but it just felt natural. 

He went on to talk about his fave little coffee shop. 

I’m definitely an overthinker and wondering what he could be thinking in this moment. He did say he was gonna text me but i feel like it’s in his court. My guy friends do think he’s interested in me based on the way he’s interacted. But I’ve never experienced this before with a neighbor so it adds another layer of complication ",8,1762000131.0,ChristianDating,3,1.0,False

For the longest time, I thought the day it became official would be some sort of finish line,  a moment of pure relief. And in some ways, it was. The constant fighting, the silent tension, the emotional exhaustion… it finally stopped. There’s peace now, but it’s a strange kind of peace.

Some days I wake up feeling lighter than I have in years. I can make choices without second-guessing or worrying about someone else’s reaction. I can eat what I want, decorate how I want, even play music as loud as I want,  and there’s something really liberating about that.

But then, there are other days where the quiet hits harder than expected. I’ll walk into the kitchen and instinctively grab two coffee mugs before realizing it’s just me. Or I’ll watch a movie and think, She would’ve hated this scene,” and then remember she’s not here anymore  not in my space, not in my story. It’s those small, ordinary moments that sting the most.

I’ve been trying to rebuild, slowly. I started working out again, spending more time with friends, and saying yes to things I used to avoid. It’s helping, but there’s still this strange emptiness I can’t quite name. Like I got my freedom back, but lost the version of myself that existed when I was part of a we.

I know healing isn’t linear, and I’m not rushing it. But I’m curious, for those who’ve been divorced longer, when did things start to feel normal again? Was there a specific moment when you realized you’d moved on emotionally, or did it just happen quietly over time?",21,1762000121.0,Divorce,5,1.0,False

1olmioc,https://youtu.be/UognuIXsjO0,4 Very Scary TRUE Rental Car GPS Horror Stories,"# ""Lost Signal"":

I remember the day I decided to take my son on that trip. We’d been talking about it for weeks — just the two of us, a little adventure through the national parks. Tommy was six, at that perfect age where the world still felt full of magic and mystery. He was thrilled at the idea of camping, seeing wild places, and sleeping under the stars.

I picked up the rental car at a lot near the Las Vegas airport — a dusty white Jeep, the kind that looked built for desert roads and forgotten trails. The clerk handed me the keys with a practiced smile. “She’s got a built-in GPS,” he said. “Just type where you’re going, and it’ll get you there. Easy as that.”

I remember thinking how simple it sounded.

Tommy bounced in the back seat as we drove away, his little backpack beside him. “Mom, can we see the big sand dunes first?” he asked, eyes bright with excitement.

“Sure thing, kiddo,” I said, catching his grin in the rearview mirror. “Death Valley’s not too far. We’ll start there.”

I entered *Death Valley National Park* into the GPS. A calm, feminine voice replied instantly, “Proceed to the highlighted route. Estimated time: two hours.” The reassurance in her tone made me feel oddly safe, like we weren’t alone out there.

We stopped at a gas station for snacks — bottles of water, a few bags of chips, and a box of Pop-Tarts. Tommy crunched chips in the backseat and talked about dinosaurs he was sure had once roamed the desert. I smiled and listened, feeling the quiet joy of having him all to myself, away from everything else.

As we neared the park, the GPS directed us to turn off the main highway. “In one mile, turn right onto Harry Wade Road,” it said. The sign was old, sun-bleached, almost unreadable, but it matched the screen.

“Here we go,” I said, steering us off the pavement.

The road began wide and dusty, the Jeep’s tires crunching over gravel. A lizard darted across our path, and Tommy squealed with laughter. “Look, Mom! It’s running from us!”

We laughed together. For a while, it was perfect.

But as the miles passed, the road narrowed, the terrain grew rougher. The Jeep jolted over rocks, and dust clouds rose behind us. The GPS chimed softly: “Recalculating… Continue straight for fifteen miles.”

I frowned, glancing at the display. The line still looked solid, pointing ahead into the endless tan horizon.

“Is this the right way, Mom?” Tommy asked, his voice smaller now.

“I think so,” I said, trying to sound sure. “The GPS knows where we’re going.”

We drove on. The world outside turned empty — no more tire tracks, no fences, no power lines. Just dry earth, scattered sagebrush, and distant ridges wavering in the heat. The AC struggled against the rising temperature, and the light shimmered like molten glass. I handed Tommy a water bottle. “Drink, sweetheart. It’s getting hot.”

After another hour, the road turned to rubble. “Turn left in half a mile,” the GPS instructed. But when we reached the mark, there was no left turn — just a faint track dissolving into desert scrub.

“Mom, that’s not a road,” Tommy said quietly.

“It’s probably an old trail,” I said, though doubt prickled in my chest. “We’ll be fine.”

I turned the wheel anyway. The Jeep lurched, bumping and sliding over loose sand. “Recalculating,” the GPS said again, its voice as calm as ever. “Proceed straight.”

Straight into nowhere.

The heat pressed harder. Sweat rolled down my back. The world shimmered white and gold, and the hum of the engine seemed to echo against nothing. The GPS map still showed a line heading to the park entrance — but the land around us felt ancient and untouched, a place long abandoned.

“Mom, I’m thirsty,” Tommy said.

I passed him another bottle, noticing the temperature gauge on the dash — 111°F. My phone had no signal. The Jeep’s tank was half-empty. Still, I told myself to trust the machine.

Then, suddenly, the sand deepened. The tires spun. I pressed the gas. The wheels dug in. “Hold on,” I said, trying again — nothing. We were stuck.

Tommy’s eyes went wide. “What’s wrong?”

“We just need to push a little,” I said, forcing calm.

We climbed out, the heat hitting like a wall. The air shimmered, dry and metallic. I knelt and tried digging the sand away from the tires with my hands, but it was like scooping fire. Tommy helped for a while, his little hands red with grit, but we couldn’t move it.

“Let’s get back in the car,” I said finally. “Someone will come by.”

But no one did. Hours passed. The road was silent, the desert endless.

The sun sank low, and the light turned orange, then violet. Tommy leaned against me, restless and thirsty. We shared another bottle, taking small sips.

“Tell me a story, Mom,” he said softly.

I forced a smile. “Once upon a time, there was a brave boy and his mom who went on a great adventure…” I made it up as I went, each word trembling under the weight of my fear.

The GPS screen still glowed faintly in the dark, the word *Recalculating* frozen in place like a cruel joke.

Night fell cold. We huddled together in the seats. Tommy slept fitfully, his small body shivering under my jacket. “I’m scared,” he whispered once.

“It’s okay, sweetheart. We’ll be fine in the morning.”

But I didn’t sleep. I stared out into the dark, the vast silence pressing in, wondering how far we were from anyone, from help, from life.

The next day was worse. The sun came back with vengeance. We finished our last water before noon. Tommy’s lips cracked, his voice fading. I spelled *SOS* across the Jeep’s windshield with white medical tape — the only thing I had left to make us visible.

“Mom, my head hurts,” he murmured.

I tried to sound brave. “We’ll walk a little, see if we can find water.”

We didn’t make it far. The heat was unbearable, the sand like coals under our shoes. After a mile, Tommy stumbled and begged to rest. We turned back, defeated.

Inside the Jeep, the air was suffocating. We shared the last Pop-Tart, dry and tasteless. Tommy chewed slowly, then whispered, “I can’t swallow.”

Tears blurred my vision. “Just hold on, baby. Help’s coming.”

But even as I said it, I no longer believed it.

By the third day, his skin was hot to the touch. His eyes glassy. “Mom,” he whispered, “I see Grandpa. He’s talking to me.”

My heart broke. “Grandpa’s not here, sweetheart. Stay with me, please.”

He smiled faintly. “He says it’s okay.”

That night, I held him close as he drifted in and out of consciousness. His breathing slowed, then stopped.

“Tommy?” I whispered. “No… no, no, no.”

I screamed into the empty desert, but there was only silence.

I don’t remember much after that. Just the heat, the stillness, the voice of the GPS repeating, “Recalculating,” over and over, like some cruel mantra.

On the fifth day, a sound broke the silence — an engine, faint but real. I stumbled out of the Jeep, waving my arms. “Help! Please!”

A park ranger’s truck appeared through the dust. A woman jumped out, running toward me. “Oh my God — are you okay?”

“My son,” I rasped. “My son’s dead.”

She caught me as I fell, her voice trembling as she called for help. Water touched my lips, cool and impossible. Then everything faded.

When I woke in the hospital, they said it was a miracle I survived.

That GPS — that calm, polite voice that was supposed to guide us — had led us off the map, into a place where roads no longer existed. I used to think of it as a tool, a convenience. Now, I hear it in my dreams, whispering directions into the void.

*Recalculating.*  
Always recalculating.  
And always wrong.





# ""Silent Pursuit"":

I had just flown into Atlanta for a business conference, exhausted and irritated after a three-hour delay and a turbulent flight. All I wanted was a quiet drive to the hotel and a hot shower. The rental counter at Hartsfield-Jackson was crowded with the usual mix of tourists and business travelers, everyone juggling luggage and impatience.

When my turn came, the agent—a woman named Lisa with tired eyes and a polite, rehearsed smile—scanned my reservation. “Compact SUV, right? You’re all set.” She slid the keys across the counter. “It’s parked in section D-14. Built-in GPS navigation—just type in your destination.”

“Thanks,” I said, forcing a smile.

Outside, the humid evening air hit me like a wall. The parking lot shimmered under orange sodium lights, rows of vehicles stretching endlessly. My SUV was a slate-gray crossover—clean, with that faint new car scent that always feels both comforting and artificial. I tossed my luggage in the back, adjusted the seat and mirrors, and punched in the hotel address. The GPS voice chirped back: *“Route calculated. Estimated arrival: thirty-one minutes.”*

Everything felt routine as I merged onto the highway. Atlanta’s skyline glowed faintly ahead, a mosaic of lights beneath a restless sky. I turned on a podcast, trying to shake the travel fatigue.

Then, fifteen minutes in, the GPS screen blinked. The map froze for a second, then flickered back to life. *“Recalculating route,”* the voice said, suddenly directing me toward an exit earlier than planned.

“Alright,” I muttered, assuming construction ahead. I followed the new directions, the city thinning behind me as the road narrowed into dim, tree-lined streets.

That’s when I noticed the police cruiser.

At first, it was just a pair of headlights in the rearview mirror, distant but steady. Then, mile by mile, it crept closer until it was trailing only a few car lengths behind. No lights, no sirens—just there. Watching.

I checked my speed. Perfectly legal. Signals? Used them. Maybe just a coincidence. Still, something in my gut twisted uneasily.

My phone buzzed in the cupholder. It was David, my colleague from the conference.  
“Hey, you land okay?” he asked.  
“Yeah, finally. GPS took me off the main route for some reason. There’s a cop behind me now—been following for a while.”  
“Probably just patrolling,” he said lightly. “You’re fine. See you at the hotel.”

I hung up. But the cruiser didn’t back off.

Moments later, red and blue lights erupted behind me, cutting through the dark. Siren. I felt my heart leap into my throat. I pulled over to the shoulder of the empty road, hands on the wheel, breath quick and uneven.

The officer’s voice thundered through a loudspeaker: *“Step out of the vehicle, ma’am! Hands where I can see them!”*

“What’s going on?” I called, voice shaking as I cracked the door open.

“Out! Now!”

Two more cruisers arrived, tires screeching. Within seconds, three officers surrounded the SUV, weapons drawn. One barked, “Face down! On the ground!”

I froze, terror coursing through me. “Please—I didn’t do anything! It’s a rental!”

Cold gravel bit into my palms as I dropped. My cheek pressed against the pavement, heart pounding in my ears. One officer yanked my arms behind me, snapping metal cuffs around my wrists.

“This vehicle is reported stolen,” he said flatly. “You’re under arrest.”

“Stolen? No—no, I just rented it from the airport! My contract’s in the glove box!”

They didn’t respond. Another officer rifled through my car while the first recited my rights in a detached monotone. I couldn’t stop trembling.

Minutes crawled by before one officer finally radioed dispatch, reading my information aloud. “Jessica Harper. Avis rental from ATL.”

The wait felt endless. I could hear my own breathing over the distant hum of the highway. Then, a crackle from the radio: *“Confirmed. False report. Rental company error. Release her.”*

The officer sighed, lowering his weapon. “You’re clear, ma’am. You can stand.”

They uncuffed me. My wrists throbbed, red and raw. “A system glitch,” one officer muttered. “Happens more often than you’d think. Their tracking flagged it as stolen.”

“Tracking?” I asked, voice hoarse.

“Yeah. The GPS. Rental companies monitor every car in real-time. If something’s off—like a late payment—it auto-reports as stolen.”

He didn’t look at me as he walked back to his cruiser.

I sat behind the wheel afterward, hands trembling so hard I could barely hold them steady. I drove straight to the hotel, but the feeling of being watched lingered.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw the red and blue lights, the guns, the gravel beneath my face. The next morning, I called the rental company.

After a long hold, a man named Greg came on. “Ms. Harper, I see there was an incident last night. We’re terribly sorry—a software error flagged your vehicle incorrectly.”

“A software error?” I snapped. “I had three guns pointed at me!”

“We understand your frustration,” he said smoothly. “It was an unfortunate mix-up. We’ll credit your rental and offer compensation.”

But something about his tone was rehearsed. Too casual.

From my hotel room, I started searching online. What I found made my stomach drop—hundreds of reports, some nearly identical to mine. People arrested at gunpoint. Parents handcuffed in front of their kids. A man jailed for weeks after Hertz falsely reported his rental stolen.

It wasn’t a glitch. It was a pattern.

That evening, driving to dinner with David, the GPS spoke again—calm, mechanical: *“Traffic ahead. Recalculating route.”*

I ignored it this time. But soon after, I noticed a white sedan in the mirror. It matched every turn, two cars behind.

“Do you see that car?” I asked David quietly.  
He glanced back. “The white one? Yeah, it’s been following for a while.”

I pressed the accelerator slightly. It did too. My pulse quickened.

“Call 911,” I said.

Before the operator could answer, the sedan pulled up beside us. The driver—a man in a dark suit—rolled down his window and flashed a badge-like ID. “Pull over! Rental recovery!” he shouted.

“What?” I yelled.

“Your vehicle’s flagged—stop now!”

Instead, I veered toward a busy intersection, laying on the horn. The man hesitated, then backed off, disappearing down a side street.

At the police station later, the officer on duty confirmed it. “No active flag on your rental now,” he said, frowning. “But yeah—we’ve seen this. Those companies hire private agents to recover cars. They use GPS tracking to locate vehicles—sometimes before confirming anything’s wrong.”

“Like repo men?” I asked.

“Exactly. Some of them get… overzealous.”

When my lawyer friend helped me dig deeper, we discovered that my SUV had been previously rented by someone who’d defaulted on payment. The system had automatically linked my contract to that same vehicle ID, triggering the alerts. When I called Greg again to confront him, he insisted, “It wasn’t intentional. The system notifies recovery teams automatically.”

I hung up, sick to my stomach.

I switched rentals the next morning, but even behind a new wheel, I couldn’t shake the feeling of being tracked. Every detour suggestion, every flicker on the GPS screen made me flinch.

Weeks later, back home, I still couldn’t shake it. Every police car in my mirror made my heart skip. Every GPS prompt felt invasive.

It’s strange how technology built to make life easier can turn on you so fast.

Now, I always ask—*Does your car have tracking?*—before signing anything. And whenever possible, I drive my own.

Because once you’ve had a gun in your face for something you didn’t do, that trust—between you and a machine, between you and a voice guiding you down the road—never really comes back.





# ""RE-ROUTED"":

I left my husband, Robert, after the fight that left bruises on my arms—ugly, purple reminders of the man he’d become. He worked in law enforcement, which somehow made it worse. He was always calm, always in control, always “knowing what’s best.” But that control had turned dark, suffocating. That night, when his temper finally snapped, something inside me broke for good.

I didn’t wait for him to come home. I threw a few things into a duffel bag, grabbed my laptop, and booked a rental car under my name. Then I drove to the airport lot before dawn, heart pounding the entire way.

The rental agent, a young woman named Karen, was cheerful in the way people are when they don’t realize your world is falling apart. “This one’s brand-new,” she said, sliding a key fob across the counter. “Full package—GPS, app connectivity, remote start, lane assist, all that good stuff.”

I forced a smile. “Perfect.”

The SUV was sleek and black, the kind that practically whispered *run*. I drove until the city lights faded into the night, heading toward my cousin Elena’s house three states away. The hum of the tires was the only sound I trusted.

Hours later, as dawn spilled pale light across the highway, my phone buzzed. A text from Robert.

**Robert:** *Drive safe, honey. That SUV handles well on highways.*

I nearly dropped the phone. How could he possibly know what I was driving? I hadn’t told him anything—not the car, not my route. My hands trembled on the wheel.

At the next diner, I pulled into the parking lot, my stomach twisting. Maybe he’d guessed? But no—he knew *exactly* what kind of vehicle I had. I opened the rental app I’d downloaded earlier, the one that let me check fuel efficiency and mileage. A thought hit me like ice water. We’d shared accounts for years—banking, email, even the occasional password “for convenience.” He must’ve found a way in.

I called the rental company. “Hi, this is Anna,” I began, but my voice shook. “I think someone else might have access to my car’s app. Can you revoke it?”

The rep on the other end sounded polite, detached. “Can I have your reservation number, ma’am?”

I read it off, gripping the phone like a lifeline. There was a pause.

“Ma’am, it looks like this reservation was made under a *Robert Whitaker*. You’re listed as the authorized driver. We can’t change account permissions without his consent.”

My pulse roared in my ears. “That’s impossible—I booked it myself. I used *my* card.”

“I’m seeing his credit card on file,” the rep said gently. “Maybe there was a mix-up?”

There wasn’t. There never was, not with Robert. He’d planned this. He’d *known* I would run.

“Please,” I said quietly, panic rising in my throat. “He’s dangerous. You have to disable the app.”

“I’m so sorry, but without his authorization—”

I hung up.

Back on the highway, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I wasn’t alone. Then the dashboard screen flickered. A soft *ding*, and a message appeared:

**Remote access engaged.**

The air conditioning roared to life, freezing air blasting from the vents. I turned it off—seconds later, it came back on. My phone lit up again. *Incoming call: Robert.*

I shouldn’t have answered, but I did.

“Why are you running?” His voice was calm. Controlled. “I can see you’re on Route 10. Pull over. Let’s talk.”

I hung up. Another text followed.

**Robert:** *I know where you’re stopping next.*

The GPS chimed suddenly. “Rerouting to new destination.” The map zoomed in on an empty stretch of road through a wooded area—nowhere near Elena’s.

I tried to ignore it, but every few minutes, it rerouted again, stubbornly pushing me toward isolation.

When I stopped at a gas station hours later, the world felt like it had shrunk to that car and his voice echoing in my head. I got out, scanning the lot. A lone pickup sat idling near the corner. As I pumped gas, I heard the *click* of my SUV’s locks disengaging.

I froze.

I jumped back inside and slammed the doors shut, locking them manually. My heart thudded in my chest as I tore back onto the road. The headlights from the pickup followed moments later, steady, matching my speed.

I called Elena. My voice came out ragged. “He’s tracking me through the car, Elena. The app—he’s controlling it.”

“Anna, listen to me,” she said, steady but urgent. “Drive to the nearest police station. Don’t stop anywhere else. Go now.”

“I will.”

But as I accelerated, the engine lagged. The display read: **Performance Mode Adjusted.** My car was fighting me.

Robert’s name lit up again. Against my better judgment, I answered.

“You can’t hide,” he said softly. “The app tells me everything—your speed, your route, your fuel level. Come home, Anna. Before this gets worse.”

“How did you do this?” I whispered.

He laughed, low and familiar. “You really don’t remember? I helped you set up the rental account last week. You were going to see your cousin, remember? I told you to let me ‘handle it.’”

My stomach turned. I remembered now—his hands on my laptop, his voice saying, *You always mess up forms, let me do it.*

The headlights behind me grew closer. Then I saw it—the town limits sign, and beyond it, a squat brick building with a glowing blue sign: **POLICE**.

I veered into the parking lot, tires screeching. The pickup slowed as it passed under a streetlight. I caught a glimpse of his face—expressionless, eyes locked on mine. Then it was gone.

Inside, I stumbled to the counter. “My husband—he’s tracking my car. He’s controlling it remotely. Please, you have to help me.”

Officer Grant listened quietly as I told him everything. He had the SUV examined. There was no physical tracker, but the access logs from the app told the story—multiple remote sessions from Robert’s IP address.

“This kind of thing’s becoming common,” Grant said grimly. “These new cars, they’re convenient—but they’re dangerous in the wrong hands.”

They called Robert. He denied everything, claimed he was worried for my safety. But the digital footprints didn’t lie. Days later, he was arrested for electronic stalking and unlawful surveillance.

I returned the SUV and bought an old, dusty sedan with no Wi-Fi, no screens, no apps—just a key that turned in an ignition.

Still, some nights, when I glance in the rearview mirror, I swear I can feel him behind me—somewhere in the glow of distant headlights, still trying to find me in the static.





# ""System Override"":

I flew into Denver for what was supposed to be a quick two-day work meeting—just long enough to justify the flight, not long enough to feel settled. My car was back home in Chicago, so I’d reserved a midsize sedan from a small rental company near the airport, one of those independent places tucked between the big-name lots.

The office looked plain: fluorescent lights, laminated posters about “insurance options,” a faint smell of burnt coffee. Behind the counter, a man with thinning hair and a faded name tag that read **TOM** slid a clipboard toward me.

“This one’s ready to go,” he said, his tone brisk, like he’d repeated the line all day. “GPS is built in. Just punch in your destination.”

“Unlimited miles?” I asked.

“For your plan, yeah,” he said, glancing at my license before meeting my eyes again. “Drive safe out there.”

I nodded, signed where he pointed, and he handed over a single key on a plain black fob. No friendly chat, no small talk.

The car—a dull gray Toyota—sat in a corner of the lot, still beading with wash water. Inside, it smelled faintly of new plastic and disinfectant wipes. I tossed my bag in the back seat, adjusted the mirrors, and entered the hotel address into the GPS. The robotic voice announced a route—about an hour south toward Colorado Springs. Easy. Straightforward.

I merged onto I-25 just as dusk began to melt over the mountains. The engine purred steady beneath me, the traffic thinned, and the radio hummed low. Twenty minutes later, the GPS chimed.

**“Roadwork ahead. Rerouting to alternate path.”**

The display blinked, redrawing the map and guiding me off the main highway. I hesitated, but it was already suggesting the next turn—onto a smaller two-lane road cutting through open fields. I figured it knew better.

I called my coworker Lisa on speaker. “Hey, just left the airport,” I said.

“Good,” she replied. “Meeting’s at eight tomorrow. Try to get some rest.”

The call crackled and dropped as the cell signal weakened. I drove on, the sky deepening into blue-gray twilight. The road narrowed, the pavement roughened, and trees began closing in like dark walls on either side. Potholes made the car jolt, and I had to slow to keep from bottoming out.

Still, the GPS insisted I was on track.

That’s when I noticed the black truck in the rearview mirror. It had been behind me since the detour—hanging back, matching my speed. I slowed a little to let it pass, but it slowed too.

“Come on…” I muttered, gripping the steering wheel tighter.

The GPS beeped again. **“Turn left in two hundred feet.”**

The turn wasn’t a real road—just a gravel track cutting into the trees. I hesitated. The voice repeated itself, sharper this time: **“Turn left.”**

“Recalculating would add twenty minutes,” the screen warned when I didn’t move.

Against my better judgment, I turned. Gravel crunched under the tires, and a cloud of dust rose behind me.

I redialed Lisa. “Hey, you there?”

“Signal’s bad,” she said through static.

“The GPS took me some weird back way. There’s this truck behind me—it’s been following.”

“What? Pull over, see if it passes.”

“I—” I didn’t want to. But the track narrowed, forcing me to slow anyway. The truck drew closer until its headlights glared in the rearview mirror, bleaching the inside of the car white.

Then, without warning, the GPS chimed again. **“Destination in five miles.”**

Five miles? Out here? There was nothing ahead but forest and shadows.

The engine sputtered. The car jerked once, then died. I twisted the key—nothing. The dashboard lights flickered, then went black.

I sat there, heart hammering.

Behind me, the truck rolled to a stop. The low rumble of its engine filled the silence.

I locked the doors.

The driver’s door opened. A man stepped out—tall, wearing a dark jacket. He walked slowly toward my window, stopping just short of the glass.

“Need a hand?” he called, voice calm, almost friendly.

I cracked the window an inch. “I’m fine. I’ve called for roadside.”

He smiled faintly, but his eyes didn’t. “Out here? You won’t get a signal. Saw you turn off the highway. That GPS in those rentals—glitches all the time.”

Something about the way he said **rentals** made my stomach twist. “How do you know it’s a rental?” I asked.

He leaned closer, resting his hand on the roof. “I work for the company. Tom sent me to check on you. Said you might get lost.”

My pulse jumped. “Tom?”

“Yeah,” he said. “He tracks the cars. For safety.”

“Tracks them?”

He nodded. “GPS logs, internal beacons—standard stuff. We’ve had thefts. You veered off-route.”

It sounded rehearsed. Too smooth.

“Open up,” he said. “I’ll jump the battery. You’ll be back on the road in no time.”

I shook my head. “I’ll wait for roadside assistance.”

His smile thinned. “Lady, it’s getting dark. You don’t want to sit here alone.”

There was something in his tone—a warning, not concern. He reached for the handle, rattling it when it didn’t open.

“Come on,” he said softly. “Don’t make this hard.”

Panic hit like ice water. I grabbed my bag, searching for anything sharp—a pen, keys, anything.

He stepped back and pulled something from his jacket pocket. A small black remote. He pressed it.

**Click.**

The locks popped open.

My breath caught. “How—”

He yanked the door. “Out. Now.”

I swung my bag, hitting his shoulder, and bolted out the other side of the car, sprinting into the trees. Branches tore at my jacket and skin, but I didn’t stop.

“Hey!” he shouted behind me. “You can’t run forever!”

I ducked behind a thick pine trunk, crouching low. My chest burned. The sound of his footsteps crunched closer through the brush, then paused.

“I know you’re here,” he called, voice steady. “Tracker shows the car—and I can find you too.”

Tracker. Not just GPS. Something else—hidden. A separate device, maybe. I’d read stories about stalkers using them, but never imagined something like that could happen to me.

He moved again, footsteps receding. “Fine,” he said finally, voice distant. “Stay out here. See how you like it.”

The truck engine roared to life. Tires spun on gravel. Then silence.

I waited—five minutes, ten, maybe more—before creeping back toward the road. My hands shook as I gripped the car door. The keys were still inside. I turned them in the ignition. The engine sputtered, then caught weakly.

The GPS screen was blank now, like it had been reset.

I backed up, turned around, and drove until I saw the faint glow of the highway in the distance. My phone finally regained signal, bars flickering into life.

“911, what’s your emergency?”

I told the operator everything—the detour, the truck, the man who said he worked for the rental company and could unlock the doors remotely.

The dispatcher took my details and told me to get somewhere public. I didn’t stop until I reached a gas station with bright lights and cameras.

I dropped the car off that night, keys through the after-hours slot.

Two weeks later, a detective called. “We checked the vehicle,” he said. “There was a second GPS unit hidden under the dashboard—not factory standard. The rental company’s owner denies installing it. Tom’s… missing.”

“Missing?”

“Quit the next day. We’re investigating.”

I haven’t rented a car since. I drive my own everywhere, even cross-country if I have to.

But sometimes, when I’m alone on a quiet road and the GPS chimes unexpectedly, I feel that same cold pulse in my chest—the one that whispers maybe it wasn’t just Tom. Maybe someone else still knows where I am.",1,1761999952.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

1olme8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/1olme8l/im_so_tired_of_the_battle_between_my_medical/,I'm so tired of the battle between my medical conditions.,"(TW, lots talk of food, disordered habits, mention of calories. Rant + first post, I am sorry if I do something wrong.) 

I'm fucking exhausted. I wish I didn't need food to live. 

I was anorexic in my early teens, then became bulimic after ""recovery"" and now I'm at the weird gray area that is osfed. I switch between habits and disordered thought patterns constantly because of my health problems. 

I have contamination OCD and autism, which leads to a lot of problems/pickiness with food: texture issues, can't stand most meat except seafood, having specific safe foods (stuff that is always consistent in texture/taste), and getting stuck in cycles of only wanting to eat one specific food/meal, despite knowing its not always healthy or reasonable. This isn't completely horrible but like, I don't need to eat ramen for weeks on end until I get tired of it and never eat it again, you know? 

I have a list of safe foods that agrees with my autism and OCD, and a list of safe foods that DON'T trigger my ed. Some foods trigger anorexic habits, some trigger bulimic habits. 

I've been able to mostly balance and control my disordered habits since my last stint in recovery 7 yrs ago. Occasionally I'll have a couple weeks of going through a cycle of restriction and/or b/p but eventually I'll get back to normal. My weight does fluctuate but I've given up on getting better than I am. 

The current issue? 

My new health conditions are making it so much harder to balance now.

In the last few yrs, I was told I'm lactose intolerant, have Interstitial Cystitis and GERD, which means I can't eat anything caffinated, acidic, fatty or very processed. This eliminates a lot of my safe foods (diet soda, coffee, most fruits, juices, soy products, protein drinks/bars, most dairy products, most SEASONINGS, etc). 

I also became allergic to shellfish in the last year, which eliminates another set of safe foods. 

I also have POTS so staying physically active and hydrated is a challenge. I'm supposed to consume a lot of salt, a lot of water and eat small, frequent meals. This is a struggle because I do shift work in the medical field. 

At this point, my diet mostly consists of eggs, oats, non-acidic fruits, lactose + fat free dairy products, minimally processed carb sources, and potatoes.

And while the food itself is bland and boring, it's fine because I'm the kind of person who can meal prep and eat the same meals over and over again without struggle. 

The struggle is really just the mental and social affect. 

It's all very ""clean"" foods that I ate a lot when I was deep in my anorexia so when I eat those things, it takes me back to that time. It's also insanely triggering because mentally I immediately know the calories of everything I eat.

And it does get exhausting that I can't easily grab a snack whenever I want, or I can't eat the party foods in the breakroom. I struggle to eat meals with my bf too, either I eat my own food or I suffer in pain. 

I'm always thinking and worrying about food and it feels like a slippery slope into relapsing hard into a restrictive eating disorder. 

Recently at work, my lunch that I had meal prepped unexpectedly went bad and I couldn't leave to get new food, and nothing in the vending machine was safe for me to eat. So I just didn’t eat. And then around a day later, I realized that I hadn't eaten anything since then because I had completely lost the desire to. 

It's getting exhausting having to balance everything and I don't have anyone in my daily life that could relate or that I could even talk to.

1olmdk9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Medtronic780g/comments/1olmdk9/please_tell_me_this_is_part_of_the_process/,Please tell me this is part of the process,"Good morning. I would reach out to my rep and endo but it is early morning on the weekend and I probably need to calm down before I say something I regret.  I just got my training on the 780g with simplera sensor on Thursday morning and was told 'let it learn you' and not to mess with it too much.  Thursday evening, I was waking up through the night and would check the pump and if it was reading 150 or so, I would give myself a bolus correction.  I did this at least 3 times in the night. The last thing I wanted to do was wake up high as I had finally 'trained' my Omnipod 5 to keep me in range through the night.  

Yesterday morning, I made the mistake of bolousing too early before my meal.  I've been coming off a 5 day hospital stay b/c I was unable to eat without pain and got dehydrated. No official testing but guessing I may have developed gastroparesis.  So I had not been eating much, but on Thursday I felt I had turned the corner and could eat more. Well that was a mistake b/c Friday morning I boloused for what I thought would be 30 carbs. I tried to eat and got super nauseous and then BS crashed to 40.  It definitely freaked me out b/c I typically can treat a low, but was so sick I could barely sip juice without fear of vomiting.  So, yes, lesson learned.  

However, once my trainer and my endo saw what happened, my carb ratio was increased, along with insulin on board time (2 hrs to 3 hrs), and correction factor (40 to 50).  She said, 'I know you're not happy about this, but we need to keep you safe.' Of course, recovering from starvation (not official DKA-I had very high ketones but my BS was perfect) and a weight loss of 13lbs in 3 weeks, has messed with my timing/ratios, but I was still able to keep tight control in the hospital. They were great with that btw- I just had to sign something and they let me do my thing. Their 'sliding scale' insulin dosing is insane!

So I made a promise to them not to touch anything on the pump anymore- no corrections, and do 1/2 dose of carbs when starting a meal, and then dose the rest if I am able to finish it and see my numbers rising.

Last night, I had about a 1/2 cup of sorbet at 10:30 and dosed for 10 carbs. I went to bed at around midnight and my BS was 135. I number I don't like, but didn't want to get in trouble for trying to give a correction dose and assumed this pump would keep me in range (they moved my target range from 100 to 120).  Well I woke up this morning feeling like crap and here my BS was hovering around 200 all night. I got out of bed at 6:00 just so that I could get some coffee and give myself some insulin so it would include the additional insulin correction.  

There is no way I can go another night at 200 waiting for my pump to ""figure me out."" My trainer keeps insisting that the more I mess with it the longer it will take to do what it designed to do- keep me in a steady range with a target of 100.  This is why I left Omnipod.  I was willing to deal with this ridiculous bulky medical equipment with a tube so I would need less micromanaging for a lower target BS and that it would help if I under or overestimated my carb count when eating.  Will this ever happen?!

I do like my trainer- she has been doing this for many many years and is passionate about what she does. But she is NOT a type 1 diabetic and I don't know how any type 1 would find it acceptable to ride out at 200 for 8 hrs..... 

Oh boy- whelp, I gave myself 5 units for my coffee and it added the correction this morning and now I am double down 147 arrows.  So now what- eat carbs, but then the pump will think a dose for 5 carbs is equal to 25 carbs?! Ugh- I don't remember feeling this frustrated with Omnipod- but maybe I forget......

Thank you if you've read this far. I'm hoping someone can encourage me to be patient or give me some advice while I'm waiting to contact my trainer at a decent hour on a Saturday morning.

1olmanf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1olmanf/i_think_i_just_lost_all_hope_for_my_marriage/,I think I just lost all hope for my marriage,"My husband (34m) and I (41f) have been together for 7 years, married for 5. The problems started a few years ago, but until yesterday I still had hope things might change. Now I don't think so anymore.

The main issue is always the same: I want to spend more time together. In reality, we spend maybe 30 minutes a day — drinking coffee, having dinner. Of course, we do have nice evenings together every now and then, but they’re very rare, and most of the time our “time together” just means watching movies — which, for me, doesn’t really feel like quality time in the long run. I miss deep, engaging conversations. The feeling that you just love to be with the other. Cuddling, Sex, listening to music together, all this stuff...

 Occasionally we’ll spend a whole Saturday together if there are errands to run and we have a date (it's not that this doesn't happen at all but for me it's too rare. Maybe once every two month). I don’t expect us to be together every day, my ideal would be to have at least one evening a week and maybe Saturdays together. We tried things like a “Saturday date day,” but it only lasts two weeks before everything goes back to normal. I once suggested spending an hour together every evening after dinner — he said he didn’t have time for that.

When he was freelancing and had little work, he played video games all day (often from 2 PM to 3 AM). Now he’s got a full-time job and works constantly — sometimes until midnight. Partly because he has to, mostly because he wants to. It feels like he just doesn’t want to spend time with me. When I bring it up, he says things like “I just have a lot going on these next two weeks,” but those “two weeks” never end.

A few nights ago, I asked him to finally be honest about how much time he actually wants to spend with me. He said he couldn’t answer that because it depends on the day. I told him I want to FEEL that he wants to be with me — he got irritated, walked away, and that was it. Later he suggested we walk the dog together the next morning. I took that as a small olive branch. But then he didn’t get up the next morning (also a thing that happend more than once) After I came back from walking the dog there was no apology, no mention of it.  I didn't bring it up either because I didn't want to fight anymore. I am tired of it.

Whenever I talk about things that hurt me, he gets defensive — no matter how gently I bring it up. He never validates my feelings. His version of empathy is, “I’m sorry you feel that way,” or “You’re misinterpreting it.” He genuinely doesn’t understand emotional validation (we talked about this a lot) and believes it means “agreeing with me even if I’m wrong.”

When he’s defensive, he raises his voice, speaks fast, and gets visibly upset — which is very triggering for me. He says being loud and reactive is his “authentic expression” and that he doesn’t want to change that. Sometimes he tries, but it never lasts.

At this point I feel like I only have two options: either leave, or accept that he’ll never change and stop bringing up anything that bothers me. Sometimes I think I’m overreacting — especially when I see how kind and empathetic he is with other people. Then I forget how different he is with me (now, in the beginning it wasn't like this)

There are smaller things too. I’ve told him for years I’d love it if he brought me flowers sometimes. He never does — says he “doesn’t have time” because he’d have to go during his lunch break.

To be fair, he’s great with practical stuff and can be supportive when the issue doesn’t involve him directly. We share many interests. But something in me snapped yesterday. 

I’m terrified of being alone. Part of me fears I’m overreacting and will regret leaving — but I can’t keep doing this.

Thanks to anyone who read this. I just needed to get it out.


---

TL;DR:
my husband avoids spending time with me, gets defensive when I express feelings, never apologizes, and refuses to change. Even basic routines like a weekly date or one hour together a day don’t last. I think I’ve finally hit my breaking point but I’m scared.

- I use small amounts of organic, cold pressed oil and never deep fry food,
- Rarely eat bread, and when I do I try to eat homemade sourdough bread. But I like pasta :(
- We use organic grains, milk and eggs. We try to buy higher quality and organic produce whenever we can. We also buy meat from very specific butcher shops that have better quality meat
- I switched from yoghurt to kefir and use milk only for sauces and doughs
- I use a lot of vegetables and whole foods - the only processed foods I use in the kitchen are mostly pasta, sour cream and cheese.
- I snack only when I'm in pms.

I like intermittent fasting, I usualy eat between 1 and 9pm. Before that just water and black coffee (two espressos daily).

I tried simeticone supplements, but they don't work for me anymore. A month ago I've discovered a suplement with probiotics, prebiotics, bromelain and enzymes which helped a lot, but since it's currently out of stock I will try with just digestive enzymes.

I don't want to depend on the pills so if theres anything I could try to fix my gut health, please, please help me",3,1761999216.0,GutHealth,0,1.0,False

1olm968,https://www.reddit.com/r/DispatchAdHoc/comments/1olm968/tips_for_perfect_ch_3_and_4_shifts/,Tips for Perfect Ch 3 and 4 shifts.,"I’ve noticed some people struggle with the first shifts of ch3 and 4 so I wanted to share some tips that helped me on my repeat runs on my alt saves. I have managed to get perfect ch 3 and 4 runs on multiple saves now and it’s honestly not that difficult with prior knowledge and knowing the synergy mechanic. I won’t go too into assignments since everyone builds differently making everyone’s optimal assignments different. You can look up which events are autocompleted by which hero though no cheating on the first run :). In fact, leave now if you haven’t experienced your first run blind yet and suffer as I have.

For building, generally choose 2 main stats and a sub stat for each hero to level. Each hero already starts with decent spreads and it’s safe to follow them. Currently it’s not a good idea hyper specialize into a single stat, but this may change in the future chapters.

My suggestions:
Sonar: int/cha (com)
Flambe: mob/com (vig) (the supernova talent makes this redundant so honestly build him however)
Inv: int/mob (com/cha)
Punch: com/vig (cha)
Cardi C: cha/int (com)
Mal: works well as a jack of all with sonar vig/mob/com(cha)
Gol: works well as a jack of all with upgraded talents vig/mob/com (cha)
Coupe: don’t matter just cut her (jk int/com/mob)
Water boy: int/mob (vig) He is a blank canvas you can use to cover for who you cut.
Autistic Depressed Superman: The guy is rank 12, 2 ranks above the max rank 10 for everyone else. You ain’t changing his build and he doesn’t level, just try and get him a therapist.

Ultimately take these recommendations with a grain of salt and play how you want. Personally I like building them according to their powers so I hate having to spec golem into mobility despite needing a vigor/mobility hero.

Ideally in ch 3 you would want to get a perfect run on the first shift to farm xp to maximize your chances on the second shift. Good sabotage rng can help pick up Punch Up’s and Malevola’s powers if you don’t already have them. You can reset who is randomly assigned by closing and reopening the sabotage menu to get around not being able to reassign heroes to try and get the best 2 heroes for the first job. After the first mission which comes down to rng for one hero, you can mitigate further missions by ONLY assigning synergy pairs to avoid sabotages and ensuring 2 heroes on the harder assignments. Synergy pairs are sonar/mal, inv/gol, flambé/Cardi C, and punch up/coupe. These pairings will not sabotage each other pre mission and provide a boost to success rates. You should be sending them out in these pairs in this chapter anyway to start farming the synergy success bonuses and building them to cover each other. This shift heavily punishes players who don’t take into account the team’s interpersonal relationships and just focuses on ideal mission stat fulfillment, almost guaranteeing only hero makes it instead of two.

You will get some random sabotages on returns and Coupe will always be wounded by Mal but they are easily managed as they happen post mission. You may want to consider to intentionally fail sonar, to send him out again with malevola, or punch up to give him an injury here if they are sabotaged. (I am 70% sure Sonar will always be sabotaged.) Sonar does have a mission where he is paired with coupe and sabotages her, he has a good chance of success in him base form and unharmed. Keep that in mind when deciding to purposely fail or send him out before this mission.

For ch4 shift one, the best way to increase your chance  at a perfect run is to carefully manage mission completion timings.  New missions pop up after missions are completed, not at specific times. You can manipulate mission spawns. This means you can WAIT to handle yellow check marks when your heroes can return and rest. This comes in clutch for ch4 when you are stretched thin. For example the moving and assembling furniture follow up missions only spawn once you click confirm on the yellow checkmark of the previous mission, allowing you to fully rest whomever you are sending. You don’t have to rush to complete every mission as that is ultimately detrimental by having the next set of missions spawn when the rest timers are still active. The trickiest management is with the missions requiring intervention. In the first trio of missions you can send flambé solo to rescue the driver, and resolve it first since he has a special option, allowing him to rest early so he can recover before the next mission at the game store expires where you send him again without having to use the coffee. The game store mission pops up after you complete either the cult investigation, stadium brawl, or rescue. You can experience vastly different results based on the order and timing you handle dispatches in this shift.

For power ups, I recommend Golem for ch 3 and Invis for ch 4. I managed to get Invis to rank 10 by ch 4 using her double xp power and golem’s upgrades are great when you can only spare 1 hero. Getting flambé supernova early is also good as you can invest in other stats than mobility and combat, making him arguably the strongest hero stat wise.

Hope everyone can make use of these tips as they replay chapters for alternate runs, and if anyone has any run optimization tips to share too please share. We are gonna have to replay these chapters so many times to experience all the paths and I want to make them as painless as possible.
