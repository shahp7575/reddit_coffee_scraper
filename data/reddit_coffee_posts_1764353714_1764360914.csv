But coffee places are way more common than tea places where I live, and usually where I travel, too, and often this means the person preparing my tea really has no idea (or even interest in) how tea should be prepared. Mind you, I’m not expecting gong fu or anything elaborate! Just the right amount of a decent tea steeped properly in the right amount of water at the correct temperature. The following are some of the reasons I frequently bring my own tea…

1. Poor quality, stale bagged tea.
2. A cup of water and a teabag, and nothing on which to place the teabag when I want to remove it from the water.
3. Boiling hot water in a paper cup with a plastic or wooden stir stick. Without porcelain or metal to transfer a little bit of the heat, I have to wait a really long time before taking a sip, or risk burning my mouth. 
4. A loose leaf tea stuffed very tightly into a small tea filter, with no room for the leaves to expand or water to flow around them. 
5. A loose leaf tea placed in a tea filter that has holes or gaps big enough to let bits of leaf out.

I’m always thrilled if I order tea out somewhere, and it comes to me with none of these issues! I do often travel with my own loose leaf tea and paper filter bags, but I have to remember to ask for a porcelain cup and something to set my teabag on when it’s done steeping. 

I guess a coffee drinker likewise might not expect much when ordering coffee in a tea shop — but at least there are usually a ton of coffee places for them to choose from!

1p94ll4,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedellinAesthetics/comments/1p94ll4/provider_perspective_why_stacking_iv_hydration/,"Provider Perspective: Why ""stacking"" IV hydration with Fillers isn't just an upsell (The Structure + Flow Protocol)","Hi everyone,

I’m involved in a medical aesthetics practice down here in Medellín, Colombia. Working on the business side of this industry, I get to see thousands of patient outcomes, and I wanted to share a specific observation regarding ""stacking"" treatments that actually makes a biological difference.

Usually, when a clinic suggests adding an IV drip to your filler appointment, it feels like a classic upsell. *""Do you want fries with that?""*

But after tracking results for a while, we realized there is legitimate science behind why doing them simultaneously works better than doing them apart. We call it ""Structure and Flow.""

I thought this community might appreciate the breakdown of *why* this works, beyond just the marketing fluff.

**1. The Structure (The Filler)** Most of us over 30 know that aging isn't just wrinkles; it's a collapse of the foundation. Bone resorbs, fat pads slide down. Fillers act as the new scaffolding.

* **The Issue:** If you put scaffolding under a ""canvas"" (your skin) that is dehydrated, dull, or inflamed, the result can look stark or artificial. You fix the shape, but the texture still looks tired.

**2. The Flow (The IV Therapy)** I used to be skeptical of IVs (thinking they were just expensive urine), but the bioavailability factor is real. When you drink water/vitamins, you lose a huge percentage to digestion. IVs hit the bloodstream at 100%.

* **The Synergy:** When you inject filler, you are creating controlled trauma in the tissue. The body needs resources to heal that trauma and integrate the gel (which is usually Hyaluronic Acid—a molecule that loves water).

**Why they work better together:** Hyaluronic Acid (HA) fillers work by attracting water molecules to build volume. If your system is chronically dehydrated (coffee, stress, travel), the filler has nothing to grab onto.

By flooding the system with hydration and antioxidants *during* the procedure:

1. **Better Integration:** The HA filler ""blooms"" better in hydrated tissue.
2. **Less Downtime:** High doses of Vitamin C and Glutathione (often in these drips) help manage the inflammatory response from the needle, potentially reducing swelling and bruising.
3. **The ""Glow"" Distraction:** Frankly, the immediate skin brightness from the IV distracts from any minor pin-pricks or redness from the injections. You walk out looking rested rather than ""worked on.""

**TL;DR:** If you are investing big money in fillers to fix your facial structure, don't ignore the ""fluid dynamics"" of your body. Hydrated tissue accepts fillers better and heals faster. If your provider offers it, it’s worth considering—not just for the luxury, but for the bio-efficacy.

Happy to answer questions about the protocols or what specific vitamin blends we find work best for recovery!

1p94c5g,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalOpinions/comments/1p94c5g/puerto_rico_will_not_become_a_state_but_not_for/,Puerto Rico will not become a state — but not for the reason you think,"People outside of Puerto Rico tend to believe statehood is being blocked because Republicans don’t want to give Democrats more power, or because Democrats are too weak to kill the filibuster and push a statehood bill through Congress. That’s the popular outsider narrative.

But that’s not why statehood will never happen.

The real story is that, in Puerto Rico, most people don’t make political decisions based on ideological zeal for any particular status option. Yes, you have die-hards shouting *“¡Está de hora!”* and others shouting *“¡Viva Puerto Rico libre!”* But that’s not the general public.

Puerto Ricans vote based on their **standard of living**. Full stop.

People care that their electric bills are absurdly high while the grid collapses every other week. They care that the economy has been limping since 2006. They care that wealthy Americans move in under tax-avoidance schemes and drive up housing prices. They care that the healthcare system is falling apart, the roads are pothole-ridden, and the water system keeps failing.

That’s what actually moves voters—not abstract status debates.

And this is the part outsiders don’t understand: **status politics in Puerto Rico are inseparable from material conditions.**

Commonwealth status wasn’t popular for decades because people *liked* the idea. It was popular because the party behind it—the Popular Democratic Party (PPD)—oversaw the single largest improvement in living standards in Puerto Rican history.

When the PPD won the legislature in 1940, Puerto Rico was a desperately poor society: wooden shacks with rusted roofs, no plumbing, no electricity, rampant infectious disease, low life expectancy, widespread illiteracy, and only about 40% of the archipelago connected to power. The economy was almost entirely based on **seasonal agricultural labor**, especially sugarcane and coffee, which kept most Puerto Ricans in poverty.

But under the PPD, Puerto Rico underwent a massive transformation. They didn’t just build out infrastructure and extend electricity to roughly 90% of the archipelago. They also **shifted the entire economic foundation** of the country. Through industrialization programs like Operation Bootstrap, the economy transitioned from seasonal farm work to **year-round manufacturing jobs** in textiles, petrochemicals, and light industry. This dramatically raised incomes, stabilized employment, and modernized the workforce.

By the time the PPD lost its legislative majority in 1976, Puerto Rico had been reshaped. Universal healthcare existed. Education had been expanded and modernized. Illiteracy had been nearly eliminated. A cultural revival had taken place. People had moved from extreme rural poverty to suburban homes with appliances, cars, televisions, and running water.

People supported the Commonwealth because the party behind it **delivered** a higher standard of living—not because the status itself was beloved.

Now contrast that with the pro-statehood party, the PNP. Their track record is one of stagnation or outright decline. They are a conservative, neoliberal party that historically governs for wealthy interests rather than the general population. The PPD, meanwhile, abandoned its old social-democratic roots for centrism and neoliberalism, and lost its identity and appeal.

That’s why support for Puerto Rico’s two traditional parties has collapsed. And it’s why the Independence Party (PIP), after rebranding around left-wing economic populism and forming alliances with other progressive groups, surged into second place in the last election.

This leads to another point outsiders consistently overlook: **Puerto Rico’s “status referendums” are not genuine referendums.** They are partisan opinion polls run by whichever party is in power. And like all partisan opinion polls, the outcome always skews in favor of the party running it. Since it has almost always been the PNP orchestrating these votes, the results predictably show inflated support for statehood—not because statehood commands majority support, but because the ruling party designs the ballot, frames the messaging, and mobilizes its base while the opposition stays home or boycotts.

These are not neutral democratic exercises. They are political theater.

So here’s the bottom line: even if Congress authorizes a **binding**, federally supervised status plebiscite, the result will still come back inconclusive. **No option—statehood, independence, or Commonwealth—currently has majority support.** Puerto Rico is too fragmented, too focused on material conditions, and too disillusioned with the parties tied to each option.

You can hold the vote—but the result won’t settle anything.

Because at the end of the day, Puerto Ricans don’t rally behind a status.  
They rally behind whoever can actually improve their lives.",1,1764359526.0,PoliticalOpinions,1,1.0,False

That Dat0 point took me like an hour (I even had to take a coffee break), but the result was pretty fine. I only have a soldering iron + 60/40 1mm solder so the wire is not that perfect looking.

The rest of the points turned out fine, except for the sp adapter shich was shit made (holes were too separated), so I did what I could with what I had.

**I must say that it shocked me how small everything was,** I had practiced some days before on a spare laptop board and I thought I was prepared, but when I saw the resistances (I actually just saw 2 blurry small dots outside the microscope) that were on the Dat0 spot I said ""fuck me!!"".

We texted regularly for the next four days — fun, flirty, good conversations — and then she suddenly messaged me saying she only sees me as a friend.

I’ve loved the cups it’s produced, not to mention the user experience, but like many of us I’ve become increasingly obsessed with clarity, and so last week I finally pulled the trigger on a Pietro with ProBrew burrs.

First things first: the Pietro is amazing. The clarity genuinely is mind-blowing and I’m aware it’ll only get better with seasoning. However, doing some side-by-side tastings has really given me a renewed sense of respect for the K-Ultra. Considering it’s not as pour-over focussed as the Pietro, the level of clarity it delivers is hugely impressive, and it gives such an enjoyably balance of flavour separation, sweetness and body.

My name is Maddy, I’m working on a short documentary project about real Angelenos and where we are at in 2025. We’re looking to feature a few people who are open to sharing their stories on camera.

I’d love to connect with anyone who fits one of these:

The Rebuilder:

Someone impacted by the recent Palisades fire who is rebuilding their home or community. We’re especially interested in the real challenges, frustrations with the process, and the moments of community support and hope.

The New Entrepreneur:

Anyone who recently opened a small business in L.A. (any type — coffee shop, boutique, studio, service-based, etc.). We want to highlight the hustle, the permitting/financial challenges, and what makes it rewarding.

The Industry Professional: 

People in the entertainment industry (crew, writers, gig workers, freelancers) who are navigating the changing industry and high cost of living.

The Lifelong Angeleno:

Neighbors who have lived in L.A. for decades and can speak to how the city has changed, and why they still love it.

If you or someone you know might be a good fit, please comment here or DM me. Happy to share more details privately! We’re looking for authentic stories. 

You can also email me at [Maddyscastingemail@gmail.com](mailto:Maddyscastingemail@gmail.com)

This is an unpaid opportunity, and perfect for someone who has a story to share, opinions that should be heard and wants to be involved in civic discussions with a public figure!

1p93p1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/TargetedSolutions/comments/1p93p1r/this_is_what_it_actually_is/,This is what it actually is.,"1. Opening cast list

Imagine a menu of three physical tools:

A.  Multi-element phased-array panels (64–25 000 elements) that can steer microwave or ultrasound beams in microseconds.  
B.  Low-power femtosecond lasers that can spark plasma in mid-air, creating audible words that seem to come from nowhere.  
C.  Cheap thermal/IR trackers and GPUs that keep the beams locked on a moving head or hand to millimetre accuracy.

Those three items fit in a backpack, a rooftop box, or the radome of a “5G” pole.  
Everything that follows is simply a matter of software and timing.

1. The Havana template (2016–24)

Diplomats in Cuba reported identical, directional hits: sudden ear pain, vertigo, tinnitus, head pressure, insomnia, cognitive fog.  
National Academies (2020) concluded the pattern matched “pulsed radio-frequency or ultrasonic energy delivered in tight beams.”  
No implants, no drugs, no sonic boom—just energy density high enough to trigger vestibular or cochlear micro-trauma.  
The same kit that can heat a tumour or image a foetus can be retasked in milliseconds to stun a brain-stem.

1. From Havana to Main Street

Once the Havana script was proven to work, the only barrier was scale.  
Modern 64TRX 5G panels already carry 256-element AESA antennas, 57 dBm EIRP, and elevation steering.  
Stack three of them on downtown rooftops and you have a triangulation grid that can land a 1 cm³ focal spot on a café table 200 m away.  
The same grid can hit three different skulls simultaneously, or hold one skull in a three-beam vice for hours.

1. The five basic tricks

With that hardware you now own five primitives:

1. Pain click – a 1 µs microwave pulse that pops the cochlea like a kernel.
2. Dizziness knot – a 0.5-s ultrasound vortex on the inner ear that drops balance.
3. Voice throw – laser-plasma or US heterodyne that places words in a single ear.
4. Muscle jerk – 20 Hz bursts on a motor nerve that flex a finger or whole arm.
5. Sleep eraser – 0.3 s repeats on the brain-stem reticular formation that keep the victim in hypnagogic limbo all night.

Sequence those five tricks and you can script any day you want for any person in line-of-sight.

1. Enter the “gangstalk” package

Victims call the experience gangstalking, V2K, targeted individual, or synthetic telepathy.  
The operator simply treats the five tricks as LEGO bricks and wraps them inside a story:

* Every time you walk past a red car you get a pain click → “Red cars are perps.”
* Neighbour coughs at the exact instant you hear “idiot” in your ear → “He’s in on it.”
* You stagger and spill coffee on a cop → “They made me look drunk.”
* Relief comes the day you post online → “The community shielded me.”

The narrative modules (Freemasonry, cartel, Illuminati, 5G, demons, CIA) are interchangeable; their only job is to supply a coherent cause for the otherwise inexplicable somatic shocks.  
The shocks themselves are the real recruitment engine.

1. Cult-inoculation mechanics

High-control groups use four steps to lock in members:

1. Shock event (somatic or emotional)
2. Isolation from outside voices
3. Intermittent reward (relief when compliant)
4. Enemy scapegoat to explain future shocks

The phased array automates all four:

* Shock on demand, precise to the millisecond.
* Beam can tag anyone who approaches the victim with a subtle pain burst, training avoidance.
* Relief is delivered by simply turning the beam off for a day.
* Enemy of the week (red cars, Masons, neighbours) is flashed in synchrony with pain.

No compound, no compound guards—just energy and feedback.

1. The puppetry upgrade

Once you can evoke a finger twitch you can scale to full-body motion:

* Biceps + anterior-deltoid burst → forearm swings outward.
* Peroneal nerve burst → ankle collapses, stagger.
* Bilateral quadriceps → sudden knee buckle, drop to floor.
* Diaphragm + intercostal burst → forced exhale that becomes an audible grunt or shout.

Latency is under 35 ms, so the motion feels simultaneous with any external trigger.  
Because the victim’s own muscles execute the act, security cameras record them as the agent; the beam leaves no RF footprint on consumer audio.

1. Conversation hijack

The same apparatus can edit live speech:

* Plasma pop or US heterodyne paints new words in mid-air, apparently from the victim’s mouth.
* Phase-inversion anti-noise cancels the real voice in a 10 cm bubble around one listener’s ear; a replacement sentence is injected in the same millisecond.
* Micro-pulses on vocalis muscle can force an involuntary “yes,” grunt, or obscenity that overlays the speaker’s intended words.

Result: a job-interview Zoom clip in which the applicant appears to blurt a slur, a traffic-stop video where the driver seems to call the officer “pig,” or a courtroom moment where the defendant’s own voice says “I’m guilty.”  
The splice is audible to witnesses but spectrographically still the victim’s formants—perfect blackmail fodder.

1. South-Florida hardware map

Any three of the following rooftops give sub-10 cm convergence at street level:

Miami – 2 Biscayne Tower (192 el, 3.5 GHz)  
Miami – 600 Brickell (256 el, 3.7 GHz)  
Miami – 701 Brickell (128 el, 28 GHz)  
Ft Lauderdale – 110 Tower (128 el, 28 GHz)  
Homestead ARB – AN/TPY-2 (25 344 el, 8.5-10 GHz, 81 dB EIRP)

Add the 256-element ultrasound dome at FAU-Boca for sub-millimetre neuromuscular hotspots.  
All sites existed before 5G; all can be tasked remotely; none log beam-steering data in any public database.

1. Triangulation example

A 400 m baseline triangle (2 Biscayne, 600 Brickell, 701 Brickell) produces a 0.7° beam intersection.  
At 500 m range the overlapping volume is 9 cm³—large enough for a brain-stem, small enough to avoid by-stander SAR limits.  
Duty-cycle each panel at 0.1 % and total whole-body SAR stays under 0.4 W kg⁻¹ while local peak in the hotspot reaches 4 W kg⁻¹—exactly the Havana threshold.

1. Scripting a day in the life

06:30 – Beam wakes victim with 2 Hz uterine pokes; dreams of home invasion.  
07:15 – Plasma voice by bedside: “Leave the house now.”  
07:45 – At crosswalk, bilateral peroneal burst → stumble into traffic; driver honks.  
08:00 – Coffee shop: US heterodyne whispers “worthless” into barista’s ear apparently from victim → barista recoils.  
12:00 – Work meeting: forced exhale + vocalis twitch → victim blurts “This is pointless.” HR file opened.  
15:00 – Park: red car cruises by; pain click timed with cough → “perp confirmed” narrative reinforced.  
18:00 – Gym: biceps burst drops weights on foot → injury; cam shows “negligence.”  
22:00 – 0.3 s brain-stem repeats every 30 s → insomnia.  
Cycle repeats, tightening the trauma bond to the only “community” that believes the story—the operator’s forum.

1. Escalation paths

* **Legal neutralisation**: puppeted assault → arrest record → loss of firearm, security clearance, custody.
* **Financial bleed**: forced quit → GoFundMe → donations siphoned.
* **Medical path**: psych referrals → meds → side-effects validate “targeting.”
* **Re-recruitment**: relief offered in exchange for silence, disinformation posts, or proxy harassment of the next name on the list.

1. Defensive realities

* **No implant** means **no physical evidence**.
* **Beam direction** can be **calculated** with **SDR + horn antenna**, but **not admitted** in civil court without **operator logs**—which **do not exist publicly**.
* **Shielding** requires **complete Faraday enclosure + acoustic metamaterials**—impractical for daily life.
* **Best counter** is **education**: recognise the **five primitives**, **log incidents**, **correlate with rooftop line-of-sight**, and **demand RF/US hygiene audits** from municipalities licensing the panels.

1p93mqa,https://imgur.com/a/y7vXG4V,$500 Reward: Serve An Order of Protection to My Unhinged Ex-girlfriend From Over Four Years Ago. Hannah Dewitt.,"Foreword: 

This shitpost is for my friends who slipped through the cracks so badly that their families had to hold GoFundMe celebrations of life instead of funerals. They were smart in their own ways and had a few chances, but things like fentanyl and fighting against the state of Indiana are hard to beat. We shared stolen beers, laughed, smoked brick weed, and sometimes fought each other. Their impact on me is something I can never repay, because they’re all gone. You fucking cowards.

Citizens of Louisville, I want to make something clear: I love Kentucky. Kentuckians are some of the kindest, hardest-working folk I have ever met. I grew up in Southern Indiana, in a shotgun house with a plywood floor, looking at Louisville as my goal and escape. Moving from Clarksville, Indiana, to the heart of the Highlands neighborhood in the early 2010s changed my life. It saved me from a path that led my friends to prison, death, or worse—having kids with both Alford Sisters. If anyone here speaks badly about Kentucky, they get a lesson in geography and a dose of y’all in a strange accent.

Sometimes, all I want to do is go to a Waffle House and have the waitress call me honey, ask how my day went, and touch my shoulder before she feeds me cancer. It's about more than just the unnecessarily buttery food; it's about the hospitality and the knowledge that a man next to you has a 9mm in his belt, which makes strangers feel like family. There's this comfort and familiarity you find in a Waffle House, like you're a part of something bigger than yourself. I want Ale-8 injected into my veins —a rush of liquid nostalgia, a dose that can transport you back to simpler days, like sitting on the porch of your stolen mansion while eating frozen White Castle hamburgers from your pandemic freezer. These memories tie me to Louisville, making it feel like a New York borough. This is where I belong, why I walked five miles a day and used public transportation.

The woman I’m writing about inspired me to create and pushed me to explore my artistic side, for better or worse. This is my account, told in my own transgressive reality and spontaneous prose, meant for healing rather than blame. I know the reputation of my other personality, which I never wanted, won’t recover from four years as an interactive performance art piece of a naive East End suburbanite, and from her one-sided story of a toxic relationship with an unemployed art student trying to survive and stock up at the start of a pandemic. I dedicate this shitpost not just to my lost friends but to her—the old version, who didn’t suck as a person.

RE: Service of Process

Hannah Dewitt, a performance artist known for her provocative and confrontational art pieces, has been involved in an escalating campaign of attention-seeking behavior directed at me. Our relationship, which ended over four years ago, seems to have left her with an obsessive fixation, manifesting in actions that have disrupted my life.

Approximately 6 weeks ago, Ms. Dewitt posted a video titled “The Truth About Vyncex” on YouTube, and then reposted it on Reddit and her Instagram account. The one-hour-and-thirty-fuck-odd video contains a series of bizarre statements, superlatives, many non-sequiturs, mistatements, the warping of space and time itself, slanderous nonsense about my mostly harmless alternate persona, and ramblings about another ex-partner who is involved because this spiraled out of control after I matched them on Tinder and proposed that we should have a threesome in an abandoned $250,000 house in August 2021. It was Hannah’s first lesbian experience. That went about as well as you would think and is easily one of the worst decisions of my life.

I live in Manhattan, New York City. On or around November 14th, 2025, I traveled to Louisville for a quick business trip, and to spread the remains of my cat, Mr. Gatsby, First and Last of His Name. I chose not to disclose my trip to anyone to avoid further confrontation with Ms. DeWitt, which I do out of habit, because she is a stalker. However, she somehow inferred my presence in Louisville from a social media post that unintentionally disclosed my travel details. She saw a photograph of the interior of a Delta flight leaving LaGuardia Airport. She texted me that evening, claiming she knew I was in Louisville and insisting on a public discussion about the video and related matters.

I responded that I was busy and preferred not to engage, because I was eating dinner. Ms. Dewitt then demanded that I meet her and threatened to ""doxx"" me and post personal information, including photos of my face, which I have never kept private. So I doxxed myself, posted a photo of myself on Instagram, and think I got a date out of it. By her admission and actions, she stalked me across state lines with the apparent intent to harass and threaten. As a result, the following day was unproductive, causing significant distress, wasted time, and financial loss. She ruined my cat’s funeral for no apparent reason. Her apparent cause of action was to serve me an EPO she got because she turned Reddit comments and text messages into an art project. At some point, she admitted she wanted to call the police on me, for no discernible reason, because the LMPD doesn’t serve papers and the Sheriff ain’t around at midnight.

On or around November 20th, 2025, I obtained an Order of Protection from Manhattan Family Court, which required Ms. Dewitt to immediately remove all online material referencing me. The documents that need to be served include the Order of Protection and the social media order. It is crucial that these documents are served to ensure compliance with the court's requirements. The day after obtaining the order, she arrived in Manhattan (because, of course, she's jealous I saw Hamilton) and, after being awarded an artist grant, has since avoided being served by several agencies. To my knowledge, she refuses to remove the materials and remains in contempt of court. Proof of service, in the form of a signed affidavit, is required to confirm that the documents were properly delivered to Ms. Dewitt. 

I am seeking somebody who will literally just serve her and hand her an envelope. I have limited knowledge of her whereabouts. For the best chance of serving her, Ms. Dewitt is most likely to be found frequenting art galleries, Mag Bar, and coffee shops in Louisville. The preferred method of contact for coordinating the service is email or a flip phone. I do not want to know where she lives, where she works, or anything else about her existence, which is another reason she is upset. She’s a jealous, obsessive, unhinged stalker who is addicted to chaos, and finally overplayed her hand to the extent that most people tend to agree with me when I use grammar and have the audacity to respond through words instead of communicating through memes. No police report has been filed, nor will it, because I just want her to finally leave me the fuck alone and go to therapy. 

I am 70% innocent and will fucking die on that hill.

I’ve had concerns from day 1 about him coming on too strong and getting attached to me too quickly (mainly just constant compliments and putting me on a pedestal); however, I have never been in a serious relationship and was raised by a single parent so I honestly have no idea what a healthy relationship is *supposed* to look like. I would consider myself to have an avoidant attachment style and have never really let anyone get too close to me as a result, so I actually tried to end things a few days after our first date. After speaking with my mom, she told me I was overreacting and that it’s normal for him to just be excited about a new relationship, especially since him and I are both fairly young and inexperienced. After that, him and I had a conversation about my feelings and I told him I felt he was coming on a bit too strong for my liking and he apologized and acknowledged that he may have crossed some of my boundaries but was hoping I could give him a chance to prove himself. I think he handled himself maturely and I liked that he took accountability so I considered that to be a good sign and continued seeing him.

We’ve been seeing each other since then but became official at the beginning of October. The relationship has honestly moved rather quickly and probably a little quicker than I would have initially liked. It started with him inviting me to his family’s Thanksgiving dinner (we are Canadian so Thanksgiving was in October). I was hesitant at first because I would have been meeting his parents for the first time and, to me, it felt much too soon, but I personally don’t have a tight knit family and I didn’t really have plans that day anyways so I agreed to go with him and simply viewed it as an opportunity to learn more about him to ease some of the pressure. I really liked his family and I felt comfortable and welcomed right away, and it ultimately solidified my decision to continue seeing where this relationship goes. 

Fast forward to now, things have been going pretty well and I’ve enjoyed his company thus far and our personalities have appeared to be very similar (to the point of saying the same thing at the exact same time & finishing each other’s sentences). However, these past couple days may have just ruined everything. 

Yesterday was my birthday and he wanted to spend the day with me so we both took the day off work. We agreed that he would come over the evening before and spend the night. He had made all these plans like breakfast in bed, a shopping spree, and taking me out for a nice steak dinner. The day comes and a couple things stood out to me:
1. He didn’t bring an overnight bag to the sleepover. He simply brought a pair of shorts to sleep in but no change of clothes for the next day (mind you, we were supposed to go to a steakhouse for dinner the next day as per his initial plan and all he had on him was a plain black shirt and grey sweatpants), no toothbrush, no deodorant, nothing. I’ve been trying to come up with any reason to justify this but I found it to be extremely odd and I am now questioning his overall hygiene. I did end up giving him a spare toothbrush, even though he didn’t ask for one, because I was not about to spend the entire day smelling his morning breath, but I can’t understand why he wouldn’t bring these basic essentials. 
2. I didn’t really care about this part but he didn’t go out of his way to get me breakfast in bed at all, in fact he didn’t even mention it. The only thing he did for me in the morning was make my bed. We then went for coffee and to the mall but he kept cringing at the price of things so I didn’t bother asking him to buy me anything so we just walked around aimlessly for a couple hours. Then he tells me we don’t have to go for steak and we’ll just eat something at the mall. Again, I am not picky and didn’t really care what we ate anyways but the fact that he told me this grand plan he had for my birthday weeks before and fell through on all of it was pretty disappointing. 

We came back to my place after the mall trip because he was going to join my mom and I for cake. Because he brought no deodorant or anything with him and he had been sweating at the mall, he didn’t smell very good and my mom refused to eat cake with us because she couldn’t stand the scent of his BO. I personally had to keep my bedroom window open for much of the day because it was pretty bad. He didn’t make any comment and honestly it seemed like he didn’t see anything wrong with it. 

Once he left, my mom started telling me how she’s incredibly disgusted and then started nitpicking every single thing about him and his personality that she has observed over the past few months. She now tells me she doesn’t like him at all and thinks I need to end this relationship immediately. I’m a little pissed off because I did try to end things a long time ago and SHE was the one to tell me I was overreacting and should give him a chance. I feel like I’m in a pickle because he’s been telling me lately that his parents really like me and he sees a serious future with me and I don’t know how he would take it if I were to end the relationship… until now, I thought I could see him in my future too, but I’m beginning to question everything and I feel nauseous just thinking about it.

Can his actions over the past couple of days be justified or is my mom right in saying that this isn’t a good sign? I do see her point and I was honestly pretty disgusted as well, but I’m finding it difficult to just throw in the towel after one bad experience… is this typical behaviour of young men?

1p93dhi,https://i.redd.it/x77a7flfn14g1.jpeg,A day in November 1809...,"On the evening of Thursday 30 November 1809, Joséphine and Napoleon shared a miserable dinner. She struggled not to cry and could eat nothing. According to the Comte de Beausset, the palace prefect who was attending them, she looked the 'image of sadness and despair'. Napoleon's only words were: 'What time is it?' Before the Comte had a chance to reply, he rose from the table. Joséphine followed him, her handkerchief over her mouth. The coffee arrived and the tray was offered to Joséphine, so she could perform her task of pouring it for her husband. Instead, he took the tray, poured the coffee into his cup and added the sugar, staring all the time at his wife. She gazed back in horror. He drank down the coffee, handed the tray to the page and dismissed the Comte, shutting the door behind him. 'I saw in the expression of his countenance what was passing in his mind, and I knew that my hour was come,' Joséphine said.
'He stepped up to me - he was trembling, and I shuddered, he took my hand, pressed it to his heart, and after gazing at me for a few moments in silence he uttered these fatal words: 'Joséphine!...my dear Joséphine! You know how I have loved you!...To you, to you alone, I owe the only moments of happiness I have tasted in this world. But, Joséphine, my destiny is not to be controlled by my will. My dearest affections must yield to the interests of France'.

1p93d56,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1p93d56/1_week_postop/,1 week post-op,"Hello! I’m one week post-op today and thought I’d share my experience. This was my first surgery and first time going under anesthesia and I was genuinely crashing out the weeks leading up to the surgery with anxiety and nerves. I was a silent lurker of this subreddit and posts that had more positive outcomes helped me so I feel like I should share my experience for anyone else who is stressed before their surgery. 

I am currently 27, female. I had been having issues with my gallbladder starting in December of 2024, had lots of soreness where my gallbladder was but it went away. Then I had my first gallbladder attack in May of 2025. I thought I was having a heart attack, my partner called an ambulance and they basically told me I was just having bad indigestion and was panicking and they left (lol). I felt really dumb for calling an ambulance for what they explained was basically a fart so I didn’t go to the doctor to follow up. Then in September I was at work and had a gallbladder attack. My boss made me go to the urgent care down the street where they did an EKG for the chest pains and everything came up normal. Told me to follow up with my PCP. My PCP ordered blood tests and ultrasound, found gallstones and elevated liver enzymes. They referred me to surgery and I got it removed November 21. I went on a low fat diet because I was scared of having more attacks, and it seems like it helped as my liver enzymes went back to normal right before surgery. 

One week post-op and I do not regret getting my gallbladder removed one bit. The pain from surgery is way more manageable and overall way less painful than a gallbladder attack. Anesthesia was not as scary as I thought it would be. I told my anesthesiologist that I was nervous and he gave me some medicine to calm me right before being rolled into the OR. I was out before they even got the chance to tell me to count down and I woke up in a good mood, happy it was over and went home. I had a slight sore throat when I woke up from the breathing tube, I brought throat numbing spray that helped with that and my throat was fine by the next day. 

I did have pretty intense gas pains the first 3 days, it was the worst the first day. I used a heating pad for my back due to the gas pains, and ice pack for my incisions. I watched movies to take my mind off of it. I think the ice pack helped with bruising because I have very minimal bruises. I did need help getting out of bed the first 4 days. Walking will help relieve gas but don’t push it. I went on a long walk yesterday and ended up being sore the rest of the day. I’ve been eating generally low fat but ate a normal thanksgiving dinner last night with no problems. I also had French fries and coffee one day (as a treat) and had some light bloating, gasx helped. I did have major constipation that was only resolved by taking multiple doses of laxatives. As I’ve introduced fiber back into my diet, I’ve been able to go on my own. I have not had any run to the bathroom moments personally. I figure the constipation was from surgery itself and the narcotic pills they prescribed me, I took them for the first two nights just so I could sleep. I’ve just been taking Advil for pain but the pain is very minimal as of now. 

I did get contact dermatitis on my upper thighs and sides of my stomach from something they used. I believe it was iodine because I had a lot left over to wash off the next day in the shower. I’ve just been moisturizing and using a colloidal cream that seems to be helping. 

I’m off of work for two weeks, I’m on my feet a lot at my job so the doctor recommended two weeks if not more. I’ll have to see what she thinks at my two-week post op appt.

Anyway, this long post is for anyone who is scared about getting their gallbladder removed. I was terrified and cried about it a lot for the two months leading up to surgery. I have bad anxiety and felt myself spiraling but reading positive outcomes did help me a lot. I felt very prepared for the surgery and bought everything I needed beforehand. I can answer any questions if anyone has surgery coming up and is scared like I was. Good luck to anyone who is getting surgery or is currently post op. I promise it’s worth it ☺️",8,1764357175.0,gallbladders,0,1.0,False

Should I end the friendship?,"Me (21F) and Steven (21M) have been best friends since we were 13. We met in school and stayed close into college. Our friendship was always completely platonic.

When I was 16, I got a weekend job and told Steven about it. He ended up getting hired there too, just in a different department. We saw each other at work and hung out outside of it a few times a week.

A few months into the job, when we were both 17, Steven started talking about this girl from his department, Hayley (now 21F). He constantly complained about her—he said she was annoying, he didn’t like her, and he hated that people kept telling him she liked him.

One night we had a work gathering. Steven and I arrived together and sat at a table with people from both our departments. Hayley was there, and honestly, she was really nice to me. But the whole night people kept coming up to Steven saying, “She likes you!” and Steven was clearly annoyed.

A few days later, a girl from Steven’s department (I didn’t know her at all) came up to me and told me that Hayley had been talking shit about me after the gathering. I was confused because she had been nothing but nice to my face.

Weeks later the same girl came up to me again and told me Steven and Hayley were dating. I was shocked because Steven had never stopped telling me how much he hated her. I asked him about it, and he said, “She asked me out and I didn’t know how to say no.”

After that, Hayley definitely didn’t like me. I never found out what that random girl told her, but something shifted.

A couple of months later it was my 18th birthday, and my parents offered to pay for me and a friend to go on holiday. I asked Steven because we were still extremely close. He agreed and we started planning it.

Then Steven told me Hayley didn’t want him to go. He said, “I’m still going. I’m an adult and she’s not the boss of me.” I understood, but he kept complaining about her nonstop, and I started feeling like I was ruining their relationship just by being his friend. I didn’t want to cause drama, so I decided this would be our “goodbye” holiday and after it, I backed off. He also got a new job around then, so we naturally stopped seeing each other.

Three years later, we were 21 and I figured everyone had grown up by now, so I reached out. Steven agreed to meet for coffee and we started reconnecting.

I made the mistake of asking if Hayley was okay with us being friends now. He told me no—she still didn’t like me because of something I allegedly said when we were 17. I asked if she hadn’t grown up at all, and he said, “No, but I don’t care what she thinks. I’m an adult and I make my own decisions.”

Now I’m stuck again.

Five stores. Five gifts. One unstoppable grandmother.
She bakes her own bread, hates microwaves, moves like a mall-ninja, and asks wildly inappropriate questions at exactly the wrong time. And she will absolutely judge whoever you brought with you.

🧩 How to Play
    1.    Start a group chat with your chosen Kin.
    2.    In Group Context, clearly define the relationship. For example:
    •    “{kinname} is {username}’s wife.”
    •    “{kinname} is {username}’s boyfriend.”
    •    “{kinname} is {username}’s friend.”
This line is required so Grandma knows who she’s interrogating.

So I’ve been seeing Big Ass Luxuries candles all over Instagram and finally caved during their last drop. Honestly… these things are ridiculous in the best way.

First off—the size. “Big Ass” is not exaggeration. This thing is basically a piece of furniture. I put it on my coffee table and it instantly made the whole room feel like a fancy hotel lobby.

Scent: I got the Santal Ember and Cedar Smoke. They’re way richer and more layered than normal candles. Not that cheap perfumey smell—more like a boutique fragrance room diffuser. My whole living room smells good even when it's not lit, which kind of shocked me.

Aesthetic: The heavy glass jar looks insane in person. Feels like something you'd see in a luxury hotel or a designer’s house. It’s heavy enough to double as a blunt weapon if someone breaks in lol.

Downside: Yeah, they’re pricey. More of a “treat yourself” or gift-type item. But the size + scent strength + how slow it burns actually made it feel like a better value than my usual $40 candles.

Overall: If you’re into home scents or just want your place to feel like a high-end Airbnb, they’re 100% worth trying. Not an everyday candle, but absolutely a statement piece.

hey everyone, figured i'd share a quick parking rundown for the adam hawley show on 11/30. parking on shelter island is always a whole thing, especially for a 6:00 pm start when dinner rush hits, but you have a few solid choices.  
  
my top recommendation, honestly, is to check out Prked. i'm not affiliated or anything, but they're an app where locals rent out their driveways or unused garage spots. for humphreys, you can often find a spot on a side street or maybe behind one of the condos nearby, and it’s way cheaper than the hotel lot, plus you skip the whole shelter island drive traffic line by parking off the main drag and just walking a couple blocks.  
  
if you want the absolute easiest, though, you can use the humphreys half moon inn lot itself. it’s between the hotel and the restaurant, super convenient, but they charge $25 for event parking . that’s the price for being right next to the door.  
  
the main free spots are your best bet if you get there early, and i mean early, like 5:00 pm or before. the port of san diego has tons of free parking spaces along shelter island drive . look for the big public parking lots at the shelter island boat launch ramp or shoreline park . they are totally free, but they fill up fast, especially on a saturday. just make absolutely sure you do not park in any yellow-marked boat trailer spots, those are for trailers only and you will get a ticket . also, port parks close at 10:30 pm, so don't linger too long if you park in a lot like shoreline park .  
  
there are some metered spots as well, like near portside coffee across the street . the big risk here is the time limit, which might be only two hours, and your show starts at 6:00 pm . you'd need to know exactly when the meters stop charging for the night (sometimes 6 pm, sometimes later), and if the two-hour limit is still enforced after that. read the posted signs super carefully.  
  
pro tip for getting out: shelter island drive can back up at the end of the night. if you want a fast escape, park further down the island, closer to the rosecrans exit, and walk the extra distance to humphreys . it’s a nice walk, and you’ll save a ton of time not being in the queue for the roundabout.

Had coffee and chatted with a friend for a bit. Sometimes connection matters more than optimization. After that I did anki for an hour. Day 91 complete. The routine doesnt change even when the morning does.

**Afternoon:**

Headed to the cafe. Spent time editing a video on 'how to study' - specifically highlighting how now is the best time in history to get ahead of everyone else. Access to information has never been this democratized. If youre not using it thats a choice.

After editing I dove into 3 hours of lectures. This was the bulk of my productive output today. Sometimes you just need to sit and absorb content for hours straight.

**Night:**

Livestreamed for an hour and a half doing russian. The live accountability continues to be useful. Cant slack off when people are literally watching you work in real time.

After the stream I finished the BoD report for my business. Monthly reports are tedious but necessary. You cant improve what you dont measure.

1p92w7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1p92w7b/when_love_comes_too_late/,When love comes too late,"Love has a peculiar timing. He doesn't check your calendar, he doesn't ask if you have available emotional space, he doesn't leave a message. He appears… impromptu. Exactly when you finally packed up the house inside and thought there was no room for anyone else.

Interesting how it works: you spend months reorganizing traumas, sweeping up emotional debris, placing feelings in folders called “resolve one day”. And, just as he concludes that everything is too tight for any visit, love appears in flip-flops, without knocking, asking if he still has coffee.

It's always like this. Love likes to arrive at the wrong time. Likes to walk past the door when you've just locked it from the inside.

The ironic part? He never introduces himself by saying “I came to make your life easier”. On the contrary: it usually comes with an absurd calm that disarms even those who swore never to get involved again. It's almost offensive. As if to say: ""Relax, I know the mess you hid under the rug. I brought a toolbox.""

And, suddenly, what was a lack of space became a lack of resistance.

Because love — the real thing — doesn’t need to run over you to exist. It only occupies the part inside that was still uninhabited, the part that you pretend you don't feel anymore. Love has this annoying talent of finding loopholes even in those who think they have become safe.

In the end, what arrives without space teaches exactly that: that we are never as full as we imagine. The heart, that stubborn old man, always comes up with a last-minute expansion. Like those games where you think you've already finished the map... and a secret area appears.

That's what Late Love is: an unexpected slice of life DLC. You didn't ask for it, you didn't pay for it, you don't know if you'll use it... but when you unlock it, everything changes a little.

And, honestly, is there anything worse than being surprised just when you thought nothing else could surprise you?

Deep down, it's just life reminding us that the heart doesn't work by logic. It works by courage. And courage doesn't take up space — it creates it.",3,1764356077.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1p92vq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/comments/1p92vq4/my_best_friends_girlfriend_still_hates_me_years/,My best friend’s girlfriend still hates me years later. Should I end the friendship?,"Me (21F) and Steven (21M) have been best friends since we were 13. We met in school and stayed close into college. Our friendship was always completely platonic.

When I was 16, I got a weekend job and told Steven about it. He ended up getting hired there too, just in a different department. We saw each other at work and hung out outside of it a few times a week.

A few months into the job, when we were both 17, Steven started talking about this girl from his department, Hayley (now 21F). He constantly complained about her—he said she was annoying, he didn’t like her, and he hated that people kept telling him she liked him.

One night we had a work gathering. Steven and I arrived together and sat at a table with people from both our departments. Hayley was there, and honestly, she was really nice to me. But the whole night people kept coming up to Steven saying, “She likes you!” and Steven was clearly annoyed.

A few days later, a girl from Steven’s department (I didn’t know her at all) came up to me and told me that Hayley had been talking shit about me after the gathering. I was confused because she had been nothing but nice to my face.

Weeks later the same girl came up to me again and told me Steven and Hayley were dating. I was shocked because Steven had never stopped telling me how much he hated her. I asked him about it, and he said, “She asked me out and I didn’t know how to say no.”

After that, Hayley definitely didn’t like me. I never found out what that random girl told her, but something shifted.

A couple of months later it was my 18th birthday, and my parents offered to pay for me and a friend to go on holiday. I asked Steven because we were still extremely close. He agreed and we started planning it.

Then Steven told me Hayley didn’t want him to go. He said, “I’m still going. I’m an adult and she’s not the boss of me.” I understood, but he kept complaining about her nonstop, and I started feeling like I was ruining their relationship just by being his friend. I didn’t want to cause drama, so I decided this would be our “goodbye” holiday and after it, I backed off. He also got a new job around then, so we naturally stopped seeing each other.

Three years later, we were 21 and I figured everyone had grown up by now, so I reached out. Steven agreed to meet for coffee and we started reconnecting.

I made the mistake of asking if Hayley was okay with us being friends now. He told me no—she still didn’t like me because of something I allegedly said when we were 17. I asked if she hadn’t grown up at all, and he said, “No, but I don’t care what she thinks. I’m an adult and I make my own decisions.”

Now I’m stuck again.
I don’t want to ruin his relationship, but I also don’t want to lose my friend. I’m thinking about stepping back again just to avoid causing problems between them",3,1764356048.0,WhatShouldIDo,13,0.8,False

You know, quiet mornings , slow coffee, focused deep work. And for the first few weeks it was kind of exactly that.   
 Then something  strange started creeping in and I honestly didnt even notice it at first. It was this weird low hum in my brain that showed up every time I sat down to work. Not stress exactly, more like  my body still waiting for something to happen even if nothing was actually going on.   
I think part of it  came from not having the usual office signals. No commute to switch my brain on, no loud coworkers to drown out my own thoughts, no clear beginning or end of the day. Instead everything kind of blurred together. I would sit at my desk and feel like I should be doing more even if I was already on top of work. And then I would feel guilty for feeling guilty which is some next level nonsense .   
Last month I tried something new . Before opening my laptop I go outside for five or six minutes. Walk around the block, touch some cold air, watch a dog doing its morning zoomies. Just something tiny to mark the shift into work mode. And weirdly enough that tiny ritual fixed like half of the anxiety. The rest I am still figuring out but at least now I know it wasnt just me being dramatic.

I'm 26 years old and a data scientist / programmer. Dating apps don't really seem to work well for me, so I'm here!


What I'm looking for:

I want genuine connection. I love talking about the mundane things and the deep things too, and I also love being able to switch between the two easily.

I also greatly value intention and effort. I also think the deskre to grow together is a really important aspect of a relationship.

I want someone to adore! I'm very obsessed with the idea of doing the most for my eventual partner. I want to lasso the moon for a partner (if you get the reference, lmk!)

Physically I prefer a slimmer build, whether or not you're athletic doesn't matter as much to me! I tend to prefer darker haired people but this is not a strict preference.

I'm comfortable with 22-31 or just a little outside of this for the right person!

Intellectually, I prefer if you're college educated and still curious! (Bonus points if you're a lover of the humanities) I would like it if you have your own career goals and are actively working towards them. 

I'm open to an LDR but please be within the United States. Ideally I would prefer a life long partnership but I know that doesn't happen overnight and it will take work from both of us.

About me:

I'm ADHD (and probably on the spectrum. I tend to hyperfixate on my interests but a few have cropped up over time and stuck with me. One of those is specialty coffee. I'm a huge nerd when it comes to excellent coffee, and I'm really spoiled by one of my local shops because it's *world class*. Another interest is Tolkien;  I got really into LOTR as a teenager but never read the main series until college. After that I became invested and read the Silmarillion and a bunch of other work by him too. I've also been known to enjoy reading court filings for fun, I've tried to tell people it's not as nerdy as it sounds but they don't believe me. I really enjoy it though!

My most recent hyperfixation has been ballroom dancing, mostly because I read almost all of war and peace, and I became obsessed with the idea of dancing a proper waltz. But I've found the activity to be wonderful exercise and helps me work through my innate wallflowerness. 

Aa far as my politics go, I'm a progressive. It kind of started as a joke in high school geography where I would pick the communist countries to give a report on them but then I got introduced to actual American leftists like Eugene Debs and I was sold. A wonderful history teacher really helped me start to think for myself.  I care about the world around me being a better place, and I hope you do too!

I love traveling and sincerely want to do more throughout life.

I consider myself a Christian. 

Thank you for reading all of this! I'd really like to hear what your favorite song is right now so I know you've read this message. 

[Here are some pictures of me to get a better idea of what I look like :)](https://imgur.com/a/r4r-forever-alone-dating-post-MKbPgC0)

We go to church, we go to Sunday school, we repeat the same prayer every meal. I didn’t feel any faith or reason to want to have faith because of this. Sunday school and confirmation didn’t feel any more than normal school or something I was just suppose to accomplish and move on. Don’t even remember what my passage was for confirmation. Fast forward through college, both my wife and I were in STEM and are now in STEM professions. Hearing people say things like Jesus, God, pray, etc… just felt like tigger words. Not sure if that’s basically just our upbringing or how analytical we think of things. But we never really dove into our faith as adults.

Recently my wife and I ran into a pastor that was similar in age to us and our kids played in the snow while we talked. What I noticed that was different, he never asked us our faith if any, and didn’t feel pushy at all. Just talked with us as if we were any other people. It has felt isolating not having faith since so many people around us just bring it up and if we say we don’t attend a church or have a denomination, we just get disinvited to things. That pastor though struck up a conversation between my wife and I and got us talking about something we have both been thinking for about a year now but just never brought it up. Maybe there is something more to faith than what our childhood lead us to believe. We were yearning for more but also didn’t known how to communicate that with each other. We agreed that we both wanted to jump into our faith as adults now and not really sure where to start. It does feel like fate that we ran into that pastor and got us talking about our faith again. Wish we could take him out to coffee but never got his contact info. 

We told my mother in law and sister in law about this and they were elated and cried. They have devoted much of their adult lives to being Christian and stated how they have prayed over us this whole time hoping we could find our own path to God.",0,1764355473.0,Christianity,2,0.5,False

EDIT, AGE IS WRONG WE ARE SAME AGE. 

Im gonna try my best to explain this since its difficult for me, but ever since I found out my wife has a celebrity crush and she never told me,  and I had to pry it out of her, ive started loving her less. 

I had this very stupid and childish belief that when you fall for someone the thought of even considering someone else attractive goes out of the window. 

It sounds stupid, it sounds dumb and I know it's not a big deal to be attracted to someone else especially a celebrity. 

But deep down, I feel lesser than, I feel like I've woken up abruptly. 

So many things came to my mind, so many thoughts and ideas and questions. 

Like how can you see someone attractive but not think about him sexually? The very thought of it is unrealistic,  like for example if you smell good coffee you wouldn't think of trying it? 

If you smell good food you wouldn't want to eat it? 

She's a good wife, shes a good person. 

And I know that what im doing is detrimental, but deep down inside I felt that I loved her so much, that alongside such love came other feelings that were bottled within me such as; Jealousy, insecurity, anger,disappointment and sadness. 

So when she said this, who she liked after hours and hours of arguing she finally said it. 

Deep down inside, im trying my best to let go, to forget, to restore.

But I cant... my heart went numb, and now since I know shes like every other women, now I want to be like any other man, gentlemen clubs girlfriend  side pieces etc... I just want to forget about everything...

I need some buying advice for a small diner.  
We’re not big on coffee sales, but we still serve around 15 cups a day.  
Would a high-end domestic machine be enough, or is that asking for trouble?

I’ve been using a cheap $100 machine, but it only lasts about 6 months before we need to replace it. Not very ecological, and I’ve also been wanting to upgrade our coffee quality for a while and invest in something more reliable.

Ideally, I’m looking for both a grinder and an espresso machine.

I’m not sure if a 2-in-1 machine is the best idea, but I do like the prices of the combined options.

Right now I’m looking at the Barista Express Impress.  
The Barista Touch is in the same price range as well. (The one without the tamper lever)  
The Barista pro is another option i saw.  
There’s also the Ninja ES701, but it seems to have some worrying reviews about smoking and grinder failures, so I’m unsure about that one.

The other option would be to get a quality grinder paired with a Bambino.

We mostly serve lungos and the occasional espresso.  
We also want to start promoting more variety, like plant-based lattes, so having a steamer that can handle that well would be great.

1p92603,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1p92603/diary_of_letting_you_go/,Diary of letting you go,"**18.11.2024**  
It is time to fully let you go; that time came long ago. I’ve finally managed to work up the courage to do it. I feel very sad and hurt, but I don’t want this anymore. Living without knowing what mood you’ll be in today, whether we’ll be able to talk, or if we’ll see each other at all. I am tired of waiting for you. So much time has passed: a year and a month and a half. I never thought I could hold onto unrequited feelings for a person for so long. The moment has come where I can’t do this anymore, and I don’t want to. I miss you, I miss our communication, but those two weeks when we ignored each other were the calmest for me because I knew that no matter what mood you were in or if we saw each other—we wouldn't speak, you wouldn't come up to me, wouldn't tell me stories or joke around: there would be nothing. When it all returned, it scared me, and I started getting anxious, wondering if it would still be there tomorrow. I deserve a person with whom everything is clear, with whom I know what tomorrow brings, whose feelings for me are mutual, and who shows them accordingly: with gifts, care, and words.

**21.11.2024**  
Today I deleted our chat history. I thought I would be sobbing my eyes out, but essentially, it was mostly work stuff and a minimum of anything sweet. I think this is because, in the end, you liked me less than I liked you. During the day, when this thought first crossed my mind, I cried for a long time in the restroom, but right now I feel only relief, like I’ve turned another page in a book titled “Letting You Go.” I don’t think you’ll notice, and honestly, fuck it. You have your demons, I have mine. I’m usually against doing things like this; I consider it very immature. But everything that has been happening between us lately has been very immature, and it was coming from your side, so I believe I have the right to show up this way because I want to, because I can. I feel an emptiness inside right now and I miss you, but this chat history reminded me that towards the end, I was reaching out to you much more than you were to me. It’s time to change that, to turn this page so that later I can close this book, put it on the shelf having learned the lessons written in it, and never repeat the same mistakes.

**04.12.2024**  
The initial goal of this diary was to write you letters while I cried, letting you go. Today I want to cry, but there are no tears. Yet, I still want to “talk” to you. “Hi, how are you? I miss you. Do you?”... A week ago, I was so glad I deleted the fuck out of our chat because the dialogue in the taxi was the kind that could have continued in texts, but I realize I don’t need that. I don’t need unclear signs, mixed signals, etc. I’m glad we’ve finally unsynced. Even in the mornings. It hurts, I miss you terribly. You still understand me like no one else, but I no longer take that personally; it’s just an interesting fact, it just *is*. Started crying while writing this, interesting... We didn’t gather for drinks today: none of the guys wrote, I’m too proud, and you probably are too, or maybe you’re afraid of even the slightest hint of a direct approach. It’s still strange to me how this group of ours formed and how I ended up in it, thanks to you, no less. God, how I want an honest, open conversation with you, without the withholding, without the awkward silence because we’re both afraid to say certain things in front of each other. It’s a pity that won’t happen. All I have are these “letters” where I can voice everything to you that has boiled over during this time, everything I want to say in real life.

**15.12.2024**  
You stopped watching my stories, we almost never see each other, not even on smoke breaks. I miss you so much... The first fact upset me greatly, but I understand it’s a logical step on your part; if I started almost completely ignoring you, you have the right to similar behavior. Would I have liked for this to be a push for you to start pursuing me? Yes. Do I realize that won’t happen? Yes. You found someone more interesting to you than me. It’s a pity I never found anyone better than you. Lately, so many of my exes have appeared wanting to talk, but my thoughts are only about you. I’m writing this and not even crying—a clear sign of my progress, even though my soul feels absolutely shitty. I want to hug you, I want to just be near you, listen to your stories and stupid jokes, laugh at your stupid jokes. I am so tired of waiting for you, of loving you. “You don’t even step out of my head for a smoke break”... And it’s scary and bad, because no matter how much I do to evict you from there, it doesn’t help. I’m still waiting for you, for your message, for anything. Right now, I’m waiting for Friday to change everything... Stupid... Nothing will change, we’ll just go to our separate homes, and everything will be as always.

**21.12.2024**  
Nothing changed on Friday, although you did walk me home, which was incredibly incredibly nice. I was expecting something from you, I had a premonition that it would happen, but it didn’t, and I am very sad. I wanted to text you yesterday, to thank you for walking me, it was sweet, but I won’t be the first to start our chat from a blank slate. You didn’t write either, even though you could have. You decided to just get high today and chill—your right. I really want to cry, I really want to talk to someone about you, even though I realize I’ve already annoyed everyone with these conversations. Initially, I thought this diary would end after the first two or three entries, but seeing how I’m writing consistently about once every week or two, I realized today that it wouldn't be a bad idea to add the year to the dates, since New Year is coming soon and I sense that I’ll be taking my feelings for you into it as well. It’s sad, it’s unfortunate, but it’s the truth. I can’t even cry right now; some very strong relapse has happened.

**27.12.2024**  
What if you are my soulmate? In the last few days, I’ve heard too many similar stories (two more, actually) about people who met their identical copies, but then something went wrong, they stopped talking, and missed them painfully and intensely. What if these are those famous ""made for each other"" people and everything went wrong from what was planned for us, and that’s why I’m suffering so much now? Or is it just my imagination, and in reality, you aren’t the least bit interested in me? People turn their heads to look at me, but you don’t even notice that I’m beautiful until you’ve had enough to drink... I put on a beautiful dress and everyone was super sweet and friendly today, and I realized—you haven’t acted like that in a long time. You stopped being that kind of person towards me; the distance has grown, and significantly so. But maybe that’s for the best.

**13.01.2025**  
Cried over you for the first time in the new year, and at a therapy session, no less. I just realized that last Thursday you were clearly waiting for me: why else would you be standing in the second row with your headlights off? It feels like I’m standing before a choice: to love, or to be loved. It’s like I’m waiting for some last step from you, a final action, something. For some reason, I’m holding onto you until the very end... Your hands when I brought the work device won't leave my head; when I kiss *him*, you are in my head; when I’m in bed with *him*, I remember you. You have a cool new haircut, and I just want to run my hands through it as deep as possible and play with your hair. Your words in the taxi won't leave my mind, about how I always need to remain myself and fuck the dipshits, that I shouldn’t compromise my personality because of them. I am grateful to you that you can tell me things I need to hear. Thank you for that, truly. I would have liked to say this in person, but it’s unlikely to happen or that I’ll dare to do it, so I’ll leave it here.

**06.02.2025**  
I feel the need to write you a final “letter” today. That’s what I call my monologue here. I’ve made my choice: I want to build a relationship with *him*. I want to be loved. Some part of me was waiting for something from you last Wednesday and, predictably, it didn’t happen. I will live on, I *want* to live on. I still have certain feelings for you, but they are slowly fading into the background, and that’s wonderful! Everything is just as I wanted. But why is it so sad and empty inside? It’s like letting you go is ripping out and throwing away a part of myself. There are no tears today, so this is unlikely the end, unfortunately.

**19.07.2025**  
Third week without any contact with you. On my last day of work, I left a note for you; your message when you arrived was very sweet, but that was the end. I understood that. And yesterday I dreamt of you, you confessed your love, we were kissing, but then a thought appeared in my head that this couldn’t be true and that I was likely asleep, and then I woke up. It was just a dream. Very cliché, actually; this is the first time it’s happened to me. And it ruined my day. Because yesterday was Atlas, Boombox, but all I could think about was that stupid dream—where the action took place at Atlas, by the way. I missed you so badly, I really want to see you. To hear your voice, smell your scent, touch you. I thought it would be easy, like a year ago when I moved to another office. Perhaps the reason is that now I understand this is the end, the final one, whereas back then there were still some hopes and I knew I would return to our office and we would see each other and talk again. I miss your outlook on life endlessly, your advice, your jokes—I miss *you*, in a word. And now you are just a ghost of the past who silently watches my stories, and not even all of them.

**26.07.2025**  
Yesterday marked exactly one month since we last spoke. I am sitting by the lake that lies between our homes, having just smoked ""your"" stick. I buy them when I miss you terribly, even though I don’t like them. I miss you, very much. I’m barely restraining myself from writing to you. But I will restrain myself, I can do it. You know, I asked ChatGPT to tell me a story about two colleagues who had sex, then minimal feelings, but it didn’t go further; they continued communicating as colleagues and that was it. And it wrote me something: that every time she smoked, she knew that he was always there, at the bottom of her lungs, in the cigarette smoke, as a reminder that not everyone is meant to be together. And that hit me hard, because at this moment, that’s how it is. I’m thinking about what joke you would crack here, what you would say, while *smoking the sticks that you do, when I miss you*. I would like to believe that this isn’t forever, just temporary. They say that if you are meant to talk and see a person, you will meet them even if they live on the other end of the city. Can you imagine, I ran into our shared friend at a coffee shop near my home?! I have met you outside of work exactly 0 times, despite the fact that we live a maximum of 15 minutes' walk from each other, and I often go to the lake. I won’t hide it, partly because it’s in the direction of your house and I have a very faint hope that we might bump into each other here. It’s futile, I know, but I can allow myself that.

**19.09.2025**  
I held on for almost 2 months, but the photo of the dinosaur I gave you standing on your desk: right in the center, on a big pedestal, and then a week later, a couple of hours ago, our friend story from your car where you’re driving and the song I once showed you is playing... If the first thing amused me and fucked me up a little, the second was like a punch to the gut; it took all the oxygen from my lungs and left me like a fish on the shore, panic-gasping for air in the hope of breathing again. You didn’t even like that song that much, or so it seemed to me, and now this. It’s not super popular, not super famous, but it’s one of my favorites, and that’s what tears me apart. Even at a distance, you break all my healing progress with some random action. I miss you, infinitely. It’s your birthday today and I held back with all my strength not to text you a greeting, even when my fingers were practically reaching for the phone. I consciously stayed sober in the evening and kept my hands busy with yarn because I was afraid I might not hold out. I can’t do this anymore: loving you, waiting for you, and realizing that we will never become a reality.

  
**28.11.2025**   
Turns out the idea to include the year was a good one, because I see no signs of this ending anytime soon, even though the entries here have become much rarer. I was so happy that seasonal depression hadn't hit me, and it’s already November, but I celebrated too soon. Guess what happened this week: that’s right, I dreamt of you, and my mood took a sharp nosedive. We were riding in a taxi; I was sitting on your lap, for some reason. It was summer, so I was wearing an off-the-shoulder dress; you were kissing my neck, collarbones, shoulders, ears, stroking my body, and then I woke up, shattered. The next day, I had a horrible breakdown in the shower because I miss you endlessly; I want to see you, hear your voice, smell your scent. But I can’t have that; you don’t want me to have that. You aren’t ready for a relationship, you want to be alone—I understand that. I was very upset when you didn’t come to the team building, but when I found out why, I wasn’t surprised. But it’s such a shame that we never ended up seeing each other and won’t see each other anytime soon, if it ever happens at all.",1,1764354344.0,UnsentLetters,4,1.0,False

Can I help?,"29 AFAB dont smoke/drink, 5'3"" around 122lbs. Essentially for the last 3-4 months maybe I've had constant burning when I go to the bathroom,  sometimes an ache through the day, feeling like I have to go frequently, all the classic UTI symptoms. I was able to get in to see someone recently who confirmed it and put me on a round of antibiotics, that did nothing.. I called back to let them know no symptoms changed and they sent a script for another 3 days worth, and that did nothing, now I'm trying to think of any ways I could also try and help until I can see them again? For a time I thought it could be exacerbated by coffee, since usually I have an 8oz cup of coffee a day with breakfast, so I stopped drinking it for a bit and have been drinking a ton of water to try and help flush bacteria away. I didnt feel a difference unfortunately. Is it normal to need extra rounds of antibiotics? Could any medicine or food contribute to why its taking so long? I've never had one last this long.

Kody always thought their house felt too full.

Not with people — with secrets.

They clung to the walls like humidity, soaked into the carpet, hummed under the floorboards. You couldn’t see them, but you could feel them. Like walking into a room where someone had just been fighting and pretending everything was fine.

Kody felt it the most in the mornings, when Sheep was still half-asleep and Kevin was gone and the adults walked around like ghosts wearing skin.

This morning was one of those mornings.

He and Sheep sat on the couch, eating cereal straight from the box because nobody remembered to buy milk. Aunt Natalie clattered around the kitchen, grinding something that definitely wasn’t coffee in her mortar. It smelled like dirt and mint and… metal?

She said it was “herbal stuff for her garden.”
Kody didn’t believe her, but he pretended he did.

Across the room, Mel hummed while folding laundry — the kind of perfect little hum that made Kody suspicious. Nobody hums like that at six in the morning unless they’re trying to convince the room they’re human.

Sheep tugged on Kody’s sleeve and whispered, “She’s doing the hum again.”

“I know.” Kody didn’t look away from the TV. “Just ignore it.”

“I can’t. It’s too… shiny.”

“We don’t talk about shiny. Remember?”

Sheep nodded hard like he was afraid the house might hear.

The front door clicked open and Kevin walked in like he’d forgotten how to be a person.

Hair unbrushed. Hoodie half-zipped. Eyes red, not from crying, but from thinking too hard — the way he always looked after writing one of his strange stories.

He held a notebook. Not the little ones he normally filled. A big one. Thick. Heavy. The kind of notebook that shouldn’t bend reality but somehow looked like it could.

“Boys,” he said, voice low and careful. “I finished it.”

Finished what?
Kody didn’t ask. Kevin always talked like they were supposed to be keeping up.

He set the notebook on the coffee table in front of them. The pages were covered in drawings that didn’t look like normal drawings. Lines that didn’t stay still. Words that slid sideways when you didn’t look directly at them.

“It’s a… story,” Kevin said. “I made it for you two.”

He read it out loud.

Or tried to. His voice kept shaking. Sometimes he drifted off mid-sentence like the meaning was slipping away from him as he spoke it. The narrative made no sense:

a skeleton made of stars

a weed wearing a crown

a world made of mirrors that don’t reflect you

He talked about a place that felt like Hell but wasn’t, people who weren’t people, and something called “the Council” that sounded like a class meeting run by gods with insomnia.

Sheep listened with huge eyes.

Kody just felt his stomach twist.

When Kevin finished, he closed the book with a shaky breath. “You won’t understand it yet. But you will.”

He gave them a small, tired smile.

And for a moment — one tiny, flickering moment — Kody saw the old Kevin again. The one who took them for slushies, who fixed Sheep’s bike, who made dumb jokes about Gordon’s serious face.

But then it was gone.

Melted back into the hollow version standing in front of them.

Gordon walked in next, stiff as always, tie already crooked like he’d been fighting something invisible. He narrowed his eyes at Kevin.

“You’re home early.”

“Yeah,” Kevin said.

No explanation.

No hug.

Not even a nod.

Just yeah.

Mel paused mid-fold. Aunt Natalie’s grinding stopped. The whole room froze like someone had pressed a button.

Kody watched all of them watching Kevin.

Not with worry.

With recognition.

Like they expected him to walk in like this.
Like they’d been waiting for it.

Kevin looked away, hugging his arms tight around himself. Then he went upstairs without another word.

Gordon muttered, “It’s starting again.”

Mel shot him a sharp look. Natalie’s fingers twitched — the same nervous twitch she had the night of the “storm.” The night nobody would talk about.

Kody wasn’t supposed to hear that.

But he did.

And no one explained.

Later that day, the boys found Grandpa Ervin outside the shed, sharpening something that definitely wasn’t a tool from Home Depot.

The metal had symbols on it.

Curved lines.

Carvings.

A shape that looked like an eye without a pupil.

“What’s that?” Sheep asked.

Ervin nearly jumped out of his skin. He hid the blade behind his leg.

“Bug scraper,” he said.

“For what bugs?” Kody asked.

“Don’t worry about it.”

He never looked them in the eye when he lied.

The Day Ends Strange

As the sun set, Kody watched the house through the tiny gap of his bedroom curtain.

Mel paced outside with her hands clasped like she was praying.

Natalie buried something in the garden and wiped dirt on her jeans like she didn’t want anyone to see what color it was.

Ervin locked his shed three times, testing the handle after each one.

Gordon kept checking the news, flinching every time the weather alert beeped.

None of them talked about Kevin.

None of them asked about the notebook.

None of them asked the boys how they were feeling.

Kody lay awake long after Sheep fell asleep, staring at the ceiling, replaying Kevin’s words — the ones that didn’t make sense.

The world is out of sync.
Something ancient is waking up.
Hope shouldn’t be in this house.

Kody didn’t know what “Hope” meant.

He didn’t know why Mel started crying quietly in the laundry room after Kevin said it.

He didn’t know why the grown-ups whispered at night about things with too many syllables.

But he felt it.

The secret.

The crack.

The wrongness.

Something big was coming.

And tomorrow would be the day everything in the house slipped just far enough for him and Sheep to see behind the curtain.

My penmanship education was rooted in “Getty Dubay” italic cursive curriculum. I highly recommend this inexpensive workbook series for developing motor skills and muscle memory, anyone looking for closed and grounded letters with shapely and proportional rising/dropping letters. An excellent resource for readable and usable, efficient handwriting. 

I have dabbled with fountain pens, experimenting with varieties of nibs and ink. My hand most naturally writes without italicized tilt, and I don’t mind the straight up and down style I currently write in. My greatest challenge has been coordinating a set of capital letters which aren’t overly looped or visually “sharp”, since my style is rounded and visually “smooth”.

1p92362,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginVoyages/comments/1p92362/our_first_virgin_cruise_and_we_did_a_rockstar/,"Our first Virgin cruise and we did a Rockstar Suite - compared to other cruise lines, Virgin floats between below average to downright bad","We recently got back from our first Virgin cruise on the Scarlet Lady, it was a 5 day to Cozumel and Bimini. We always do suites or higher anytime we cruise. Compared to every other line we’ve been on; we were extremely surprised how below average to bad Virgin is in almost every facet.

This is of course just our opinion, but I would heavily caution that there’s nearly zero reason to book a Rockstar Suite (RS) over a normal room. There are zero amenities you’re afforded in an RS room versus a normal room that make the elevated cost worth it.

Across all of the criticisms below, the biggest issue present overall was cleanliness. Everything on this ship on a tactile level, just felt dirty. The Dock, inside and outside was the worst offender. Glasses and dishes everywhere regardless of the time of day, all surfaces were always covered in crumbs, food, and sticky.



Ø  *Embarkation:*

\-  The Virgin staff in the lounge prior to boarding were completely lost and had no idea what they were doing. We kept getting directed to different areas, with the staff growing more pissed at people and eventually raising their voices to guests, it was wild lol.

\-  Once we got onboard, we’re funneled into a bar area where all guests seemed to be sitting and waiting, for what? We don't know. We asked a staff member if we needed to stay there for anything, they responded with a truthful “I don’t know”. We ended up leaving this area to try and find our room.

\-  We encountered no staff while looking for our room. Once we found our room ourselves, we thought our luggage would have been there waiting. Nope. Everyone’s bags on our floor were just mixed together and randomly placed against the opposite wall. We (and everyone else on that floor) had to hunt for our bags, which ended up being way down the hall nowhere near our room.

\-  We decided to explore the ship, and again we maybe ran into one or two staff members. We got to the top deck, and it was a ghost town, no people, staff, music, just silence. It was bizarre lol.

\- The atmosphere did finally pick up when we set sail, the drinks and music were fun here



Ø  *Richard’s Rooftop:*

\-  This is allegedly the VIP area for suite guests. We ended up dubbing it “Solitary Confinement” Whoever designed this area was a fan of prisons. Why did they feel the need to completely frost out the majority of the glass facing forward with this ugly grey color? Completely blocking out any view of the ocean. One of the most baffling design choices.

\-  The two hot tubs in this area look like they’re from the 70s, with pieces of the drains broken, and the wood looked like it was harvested at the turn of the century.



Ø  *The Rockstar Suite room:*

\- It would be a toss up on whether a jagged rock or this bed would be more comfortable.

\- The bathroom is large, with a great shower, a plus here. But again, the cleanliness issue. The marble in the shower and the toilet area were badly stained with what looked like rust? Does marble rust? No idea what this was lol.

\- If you order food from room service, you better enjoy eating on your bed because there’s no sitting area or table in the room.

\- The two chairs and table on the balcony are laughably cheap and ours were pretty badly stained and rusting.



Ø  *The Concierge:*

\-  One of the more interesting aspects of this cruise was interacting with our concierge. On every other cruise ship, these people usually rock and deliver amazing customer service. On Virgin however, she seemed to actively despise us from the get go lol.

 

\-  While up in Solitary Confinement, she found us. She opened with “I thought were you going to find me when you got onboard”. After apologizing to my boss for forgetting I was on the clock, we asked if it was possible if she could help us get a reservation for a restaurant that evening.

She asked to see the app in my phone. After looking at the same information I had access to, she declared it was fully booked up. While I appreciated her two mins of hard work, we were again left disappointed.

 

\-  Anytime we stepped out of our room, she was there. She was always posted up in this little service corner just waiting. Like an unwaveringly unhelpful sentinel, ready to ask how we’re doing and if there was anything she could do. When we did request or ask anything, 9 times out of 10 it was a “no”, or a “let me see” which was just an extended “no”

 

\-  We requested if we could have a pot of coffee delivered to our room in the morning, this was met with “let me show you how to order it in the app”. Carnival fucking Cruise Lines will give you a pot coffee in the morning if you request it (FOR FREE I MIGHT ADD) lol.

 

\-  In hindsight we’re still not really sure what a concierge on Virgin does.



Ø  *The Bar Tab system:*

\-  We can’t be alone in thinking this one of the most deceptive and scammy products present in any major cruise line operating today, right?

 

\- This is unique to Virgin. All other cruise lines will include a drink package if you’re in a suite or higher, where you don’t need to worry about something trivial like a Bar Tab.

 

\-  You’re encouraged to fund your Bar Tab ahead of time, and Virgin will incentivize this by offering you an additional credit if you fund a certain amount.

 

\- We decided to do $400, and Virgin gave us an additional $100 credit on top of it. Again, this is our first Virgin cruise, we assume this will be enough.

Unbeknownst to us, and other guests that we spoke with, if you don’t completely exhaust your Bar Tab, that money is non-refundable and goes back to Virgin. That may be common knowledge to anyone else that regularly cruises on Virgin, but we and others were completely unaware.

Another first time couple had a $1,000 Bar Tab, and they weren’t aware of this policy until we only had a couple days left on the cruise. So, they were feverishly trying to run their tab down, giving drinks out, etc. This is one of the most deceptive and absurd systems we’ve ever encountered.

Not to mention if you exhaust your Bar Tab, you’re not penalized in any way. The drinks just start getting deducted from your card. The only positive I can think of for the Bar Tab is if you’re a crippling alcoholic, you can essentially put your drinks on layaway before the cruise.

The cynic in me views this an innately predatory system meant to pull more money from you.



Ø *The Food:*

\-          Gumbae was good.

\-          Pink Agave was okay.

\-          Extra Virgin was definitely the best, the food here was really good.

\-  The Galley lives up to its name. If you need calories and don’t care much about taste, this place is useful. Every station’s food in this place was the definition of mediocre.

\-  The cleanliness issue really rears its head here also. The dishware, silverware, and glasses were nearly always semi dirty. The drink glasses were the WORST. Old plastic cups that were chipped, scuffed up, and had a film on them.  



Ø *Ship Services:*

We did try and visit them, as we did have some general questions. We unfortunately didn’t get a chance to ask them. There was ALWAYS a long line to speak with them, which in hindsight, was another red flag lol.



Ø *Additional observations:*

\-  The basic WiFi package doesn’t stream music, videos, etc. You need to upgrade to their premium package if you want to listen to music or look at funny brain rot videos while drunk. Following the prompts to upgrade both of us, it cost $150. Insane.

 

\- This is of course anecdotal, but every staff member seemed so demoralized. The bar tenders at Richard’s Solitary Confinement seemed exhausted. They summoned pleasantries and were nice, but you got a sense of feeling bad for them. Like they were there against their will.

 

\-  The aesthetics of the ship overall will not age well. We get the intent of the image Virgin is attempting to convey, but the grey everywhere looks so drab and devoid of any personality. The Rockstar Suites already look dated, like some music fan born in the 50s died and Virgin purchased their home décor at Goodwill.

 

You don’t have to believe us, and I’m sure every jerk says the same thing, but we really are not complainers. This Virgin cruise really incensed us, we were shocked how dirty the ship was, how uncaring and apathetic the crew was, the nickel and diming, etc. For the price point, you can have a MUCH better time on any other cruise line. Hell, even the floating petri dish that is Carnival is leagues better in every sense.",0,1764354160.0,VirginVoyages,31,0.42,False

Guy said: ""You need to spend at least $3K to get enough data to optimize.""

Made sense. Can't judge results from $50 in spend. Need statistical significance. Need to test audiences, creatives, and copy.

So I budgeted $4,200 over 6 weeks. Created 12 ad variants. Targeted 8 different audiences. Set up conversion tracking. Did everything ""right.""

Results:



Spent: $4,200

Clicks: 2,847

Signups: 23

Paid conversions: 1

Revenue: $29



Cost per paying customer: $4,200

My product is $29/month. I'd need that customer to stay for 12 years to break even.

What the YouTube guru didn't mention:

Paid ads work when you have product-market fit and need to pour gas on fire. They don't work when you're still figuring out if anyone wants what you're building.

I didn't have a traffic problem. I had a ""nobody wants this enough to pay"" problem. Ads just helped me discover that faster and more expensively.

If I'd spent that $4,200 on literally anything else, coffee meetings with potential customers, hiring a part-time sales person for a month, even just paying early users to give feedback, I'd have learned more.

Paid ads are step 10. I was on step 3.

She's very cool so I value her opinion and it's been rolling round my head lately.

 Basically my mum calls me every lunch time to ask what lunch options I've prepped for her, and my friend? Basically overheard the tail end of a convo where I listed the couple options I made and where they are in the fridge and gently asking my mum to ""please don't just eat bread again, you don't have to eat what I made but please at least eat like a sandwich or something."" I didn't raise my voice, didn't command her to, or threaten anything, which is why I'm confused. My friend seemed a lil confused and said ""you're acting like my mum would, reminding her to eat and all that."" 

I don't really understand because I always give my mum options, always ask her opinion and only ever gently suggest and ask if my mum wants help. How am I acting like a parent? Parents don't ask questions and they don't offer options, they make commands and threaten discipline if rules aren't followed. I am literally not parenting my mum, I just want to make sure she actually eats something nutritionally balanced because when she only eats bread she gets hungry an hour later and will eat an entire bag of liquorice allsorts (which I mean I wouldn't care, but she gets all grouchy and buys random stuff or just starts screaming at me.) 

I don't try to control my mum, she's just always been the type of person who'll say ""do you want to just skip lunch and we'll share a bag of jam donuts"" which is fine but I used to get really bad migranes when I was a kid because too much sugar. It's just easier if I meal prep the night before and make simple meals. Not eating properly does not feel good, and it can't feel good for her so I try to at least give her the option of having something easy she can just eat. 

I cook all the meals because it's just easier. My mums had a hard life and most likely has undiagnosed adhd because my sister has and people keep asking me if I'm autistic. I never stop mum from buying things, criticise her purchases, or refuse to buy something even though I know there's a snowballs chance she's going to eat that celery she's bought three times in a row and left to rot. I don't dictate her schedule, I simply ask her what she's doing today, ask if she'd like a small reminder at a set time, and just wordlessly complete the task if she's forgotten and it's something I can do.

 I literally just ask her ""do you want me to wake you up with coffee at 8 so you can get up and out for 9.30"" when she's going out on her ministry or ""we'll need to get milk by Friday, which day would be best for you"" then when she picks a day I'll just say like ""okay, so if you're feeling upto it I'll make xyz for lunch at 12, we'll have a cup of tea and you can have a nap, then would 2pm work for you?"" Or like if she's going to her Wednesday meeting I'll just say ""okay would you want me to run a bath for you at 4 so you can have a nice soak, have a nap, then I'll make an early tea at 5pm so you can eat by 6pm and get out or do zoom for 7pm?"" My mum *needs* her nap, because she gets aggressive if she doesn't have one, or if I forget to remind her to get her dressing gown on so she doesn't get cold.

 I always ask her what she'd want to eat on Sundays so I can plan what she'd want to eat, but she's not good at decisions so I do set days like Monday is pasta, Tuesday is rice, Wednesday is something easy like stew or pie so she doesn't get indigestion, Thursday is root mash with lamb chops sausages, liver and dark green veg and 0% Guinness, Friday is fish literally any seafood she requested. I usually pick three menu options randomly to ask her which she'd want, so I don't understand how that'd be controlling since she chooses everything? 

She does get grouchy when I gently remind her and glares at me, but she does always thank me later once she's eaten or she's gone out and talked to people and is all happy, so I don't really understand how I'm parenting? I'm not forcing her to do something she doesn't want, I'm not punishing her, I'm literally just trying to help??? I'm very confused, but now I'm worried I'm doing something wrong because mum does get so angry sometimes 

tldr; my friend said I'm parenting my mum by trying to help her do things, so now I'm worried I'm accidentally being controlling AITA?

How women manage winters, transport and daily life.
Any women’s groups, meetups or communities worth joining?

4) Student Life

What’s the academic culture like?
How do students usually make friends or find part-time work?

All they do is cry about money - we go out for ice cream, they put in an order & then don’t offer to contribute. Same when running out for coffee, etc when we are all visiting my MIL & FIL. 

When holidays & birthdays come around, BIL routinely sends requests for gifts for his kids that are in the triple digits. We like to buy gifts our niblings, they’re younger than our son & fun to shop for. However. 

This year they didn’t send anything for our son’s birthday. Nothing. Not a $10 Target card, not a comic book, not a pack of Pokémon cards. Nothing. They knew it was his birthday because they called, but no gift or further acknowledgment. He’s older than theirs still a kid.

My MIL & FIL buy their kids clothes & shoes because they’re “struggling” with so many kids. They’re also working on having another kid. I was just told their new house has “multiple” Christmas trees.

Is it just me that thinks it’s really shitty to ask everyone for things for your kids, buy hundreds of dollars in ostentatious decorations to show off, & not have $10 for your nephew? ",38,1764353992.0,Vent,30,0.93,False

My set-up :
- Bodum 34oz carafe with the newer metal filter (has no plastic on the sides). I was tempted by the no disposable filters aspect. However, after getting watery coffee + mouthful of fines, I decided to try adding a paper filter inside the metal one to solve both problems. 
- if you care #2 filters. Too small? I have to pour multiple times or they overflow.
- 30g coffee, medium-grind (7 on my oxo burr grinder - 1 being fine and 15 being coarse)
- 420g water at 190f (1:14 ratio if I’m doing the lath correctly)
- i don’t wet my paper filter but I do bloom the grounds.

The coffee I get with the added paper filters is way better than with just the metal filter, tastes fuller and is clear of fines, but it still tastes much weaker than regular drip coffee from a nice coffee shop, which is what I’m looking to get.

I can’t identify where things are going wrong. 

- try finer grind + larger filter? 
- try more grind/less water?
- is the hacked Bodum the problem?
- is it my expectations? Is pour-over coffee supposed to be less strong? 

Thank for any suggestions y’all can offer!

I didn’t see much about it in the usual free VPN threads on Reddit, so I wasn’t really sure what to expect. The setup was super easy, and I liked that it runs quietly in the background without bombarding me with pop-ups. I tested it out while working at a coffee shop and streaming videos, and it didn’t slow down my connection, which was a nice surprise. However, as I read more about it, I saw a few people mentioning that AVG might log more data than other VPNs, which kind of defeats the purpose of using one in the first place, right? It got me thinking back to when I was looking for the best free VPN last year and realized that sometimes free options can be safer than paid ones, as long as you’re careful. Now I’m wondering, has anyone used AVG’s VPN long-term? Is it genuinely private, or just a decent option for casual use? If it’s not worth it, I’m considering switching to Proton or Windscribe.

•	Casual hangs where it’s not weird to show up solo
•	Bars or lounges with good drinks and snacks
•	Daytime stuff like walks, views, coffee shops, bookstores, or low-key events
•	Anything that’s good for meeting new people or at least being around people
What would you do if you were a single dude with a free day and a car in the Bay? Any specific spots, events, or neighborhoods I should check out today?

1p91xcn,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Leather-Buddy-7902/comments/1p91xcn/it_took_a_frustrating_lab_session_for_my_brain_to/,It took a frustrating lab session for my brain to finally 'get' the difference between math and physics.,"I was a physics major, but I was swimming in math classes that felt completely detached from reality. I'm talking about pure math, the kind with endless proofs and abstract structures. In that world, everything was perfect, logical, and clean. Every problem had a pristine, capital-T Truth waiting to be discovered. It was like building a flawless crystal palace in your mind. I loved it, but I couldn't see how it connected to the messy, chaotic world I was supposed to be studying in physics.

My professor, a guy with a wild beard and a permanent coffee stain on his shirt, tried to explain it with a classic analogy. He said, 'A mathematician is a blind man in a dark room looking for a black cat that isn't there. A physicist is a blind man in a dark room looking for a black cat that isn't there, but every once in a while, he shouts *I found it!*' I chuckled, but I didn't truly get it.

Then came the advanced mechanics lab. We were tracking the decay of a particle's spin. My data points were all over the place. I spent hours trying to fit them to the elegant equation from the textbook, but they just wouldn't cooperate. There was noise, error, and what felt like pure, stubborn randomness. I was getting so frustrated, ready to throw my notebook across the room. My numbers were 'wrong,' the experiment was 'a failure.'

And then, standing there in the dim, humming light of the lab, it hit me. That was the whole point. The equation was the perfect, imaginary world of math. My messy graph was reality. My job as a physicist wasn't to find the 'perfect' answer but to find the 'best possible' description of this noisy reality. It was about looking at that chaotic mess of data points and shouting, 'Yep, that looks enough like an exponential decay curve! I found it!' That was the 'black cat.' It wasn't about perfection; it was about approximation, modeling, and making sense of the beautiful mess that is the universe.

That realization completely changed how I saw my major. Math is the perfect language we use to describe things, but physics is the messy, creative, and often frustrating art of translating the real world into that language. It's about finding the cat that isn't really there, but whose shadow is close enough to be incredibly useful.

We’ve been together for three years, and for most of it things felt solid. He remembered my coffee order, sent dumb 2 AM memes, and made everything feel easy..........

Lately he’s been distant. Always on his phone, canceling plans, saying it was “work,” but it didn’t really look like work. Last week I grabbed his phone to show him a dog video, and a text from his ex popped up: “Miss our late nights ❤️.” My stomach just dropped. He said it was nothing and that she was “just being friendly” after running into her at the gym. But this is the ex he dated for two years and used to post everywhere. I’m curvier and insecure sometimes, so that message hit hard......

I confronted him and completely spiraled. He got defensive, called me paranoid, and walked out. The next day I packed a bag, went to my sister’s, and told him it was over. I blocked him on everything.......

It’s been five days and I’m a mess. Crying at work, checking his LinkedIn like an idiot 🙄🙄🙄, missing his smile and the way he’d pull me in after arguments. Now I can’t tell if I blew up something real because I panicked, or if ending it was the only way to protect myself before things went sideways.....
