1qijkru,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1qijkru/friend_hasnt_been_being_himself_lately/,Friend hasn't been being himself lately.,"My friend, also my roommate, has been acting less like himself. He's a bit slow with responses, and seems confused and out of it whenever I see him. He works weird hours, doesn't get much sleep as far as I'm aware, but his room in the apartment is kind of.... messy, to say the least. I'm a bit concerned, I don't know how to bring this up with him. I've been keeping track of his daily routine to try and accommodate him, making him coffee before work, and so on. Basically, what friends do, y'know? 

I don't really know, but I'm concerned nonetheless. He's just been distant and I hope it's not anything I did, but I want to figure out how to bring this concern up. He needs to talk to someone instead of bottling up how he feels. I don't want to see him waste away, I want him to be happy. ",1,1768957391.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False
1qijjw6,https://i.redd.it/gthniry0kleg1.jpeg,"This Time Last Year, She Refused to Walk","Just looking back at some pictures, this little booger was impossible to take for a walk. It was just me carrying her around every morning, especially at first. Sometimes she would just sit there, staring into the dark morning like this picture. I would be like, ""Buddy, we're the only ones up. Let's go-o-o-o-o!"" She was not swayed.

But after many early-morning walks (and treats), she is now the best city dog I've ever had. We walk to coffee shops, stand in line around other dogs, read a newspaper for an hour on a bench, drink a beer at the bar, etc. I brag because I did not train my last dogs very well, and I felt like I couldn't take them anywhere. It was a lot of trial and error for me, and as you all know, it's really hard to train dogs. But man, this dog was different. A lot of things just clicked this time.

We walk in the daytime now. The best thing about this dog is that she has helped me meet so many of my neighbors. She makes grumpy-looking people smile. She makes people share stories about their own lives. And the best part is she makes some people talk about their childhood dogs; those are by far the best stories.

This is a bit confusing and I think the more confusing parts is that things just do not align up or make sense for me.

We (M24, F25) are both from a western country, in Europe specifically, where meeting other muslims can sometimes be very difficult. Due to this, we met on a more untraditional platform, namely a facebook matchmaking profile.

While everything seemed too good to be true, in the sense that we aligned on absolutely everything, both deen, education, and personal aspects.

The main problem is that there was not once during those 2 months, that she had “gotten feelings” for me at all. We exchanged pictures on day 2, where we both accepted how the other person looked like, and personally I haven’t had problems with my looks. This was my second time talking marriage, where the first girl became interested after an hour of talking and had her decision ready after two weeks (which even I find fast!).

We have went on a total of 4 dates, first two being coffee dates, one bowling and the other movies/restaurant.

She always told me, that she had a positive outlook on the marriage, and just 15 days ago told me, that she leans more towards a yes. Behavior wise, she didn’t seem like a person who was deeply uninterested in me. She wrote sweet messages, showed interest in my days and me, and even said yes to being there for my graduation in june. She told me, that she genuinely believes she can’t find anyone better, I’m a “golden person” and due to my islamic work in this country, feels my deen is on point too. This is 100% her words.

4 days later after our fourth meeting, I got a message that she has 0 feelings and had to end it, making it very direct that “her heart feels nothing”.

I can’t help but be a bit confused. If I’m \*that\* perfect in her eyes, why would she let me go? She was scared that feelings wouldn’t come, even if we meet a lot more times. This was her first time talking marriage as well, which I genuinely believe does a difference.

Another part is that I think the feelings were lacking from constantly writing, which I want opinions about too. From those almost 2 months, we wrote nearly 12.000-14.000 messages, genuinely having a good time with eachother. I wasn’t “hard to get”.

It’s just sad, because we both genuinely believe that it would have been a good marriage.

What is actually going on? Am I just unlucky with her? Is this a classical “shes not ready for marriage” situation? Will she regret it?",0,1768957177.0,MuslimMarriage,0,0.5,False

Chapter 1

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says to me.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf in my head.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat and loads up my bags.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I can manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.

The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.

Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.

I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.

I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and damage we do fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chucking it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will enquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf did not touch anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.

Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

1. really curious about looking up stuff on irrelevant questions that pop up in my head (but it felt really satisfying to my brain to do that)

i hope that makes sense

# motivation

1. crazily motivated to start doing tasks i need to do, motivated to start locking in on a hobby i wanna get involved in.

(also felt super good to do)

but my point of this post is that after a month of this feeling it all went away no matter what i did to try get it back, so im hoping one of you beautiful people can relate and give me some of your experiences or some advice on how to get it all back, obviously because of how good it makes me feel as a person knowing that im not acctually a lazy being and i want to get stuff done

Long story short, I hadn’t realised I ran out of scripts until it was too late. I’ve tried to get a new script from my doctor, but being in Victoria, he couldn’t prescribe me unless he got a permit (which was never full explained to me when he referred me, just simply that once I got diagnosed he could “prescribe me without needing to go to the psych”). I tried going through the process of getting the permit arranged for the doctor as he could “prescribe me by the end of the week” but turns out it’s taking about 10-15 Business Days for permits to turn around and I would be forced to book an initial $60 standard appointment (post-Medicare Rebate) to arrange the application for the permit and then a subsequent $200 appointment (post-Medicare Rebate) to receive my prescription. Safe to say, it’s cheaper to just see my psych. The earliest appointment I have been able to get is early Feb.

It’s been a week without my medication and I’m struggling severely. I’m exhausted, no matter how much sleep I get. I can’t motivate or focus at work - I just want to leave, crawl in bed and do nothing. I don’t feel like myself, I genuinely feel empty inside as I’m too exhausted to even feel (let alone express) emotion.

The weirdest thing in my life is that if I was to passively live, I would just have guys around me. I dont naturally collect female friends. The strangest part is that I am very cordial to women that I see around the hospital or in coffee shops. I dont do anything different between men and women.  For example, when i go out to coffee shops, I dont even talk to anyone: male or woman. 

Yet, I found myself connecting with men somehow. 

So I want to self-correct to figure out this issue. I know that I am not weird around women. For example, I had a female classmate that I barely know talk to me in the elevator and wish me a good day. I just met her literally last week.

I travel for work so during busy season i will be on the road for 3-4 days, return home for a few days, and on the road again.

However, the flavors noticeably tapers off when i brew the same bag in the next few days. It's not bad, per se, just isn't as good as those first one or two cups after an extended absence from home.

Creaking of worn out springs of those that would rise for the first time, to dress for this new occasion. Sprinting had been the canine down longer set of stairs, A child left to watch, A canine that had been no more then a passing blur. One that vanished around the corner at the sound of a newly open door. Swearing of one that had been swept off his feet by this wave of passing fur, for this beast had come to meet the rooster's beck and call.

Was hard to tell which had been louder, the slow creak of his parent's door opening, or that of each step they took across these dusty floorboards. Following the small prints their boy had left down the hall, towards the spot he was found. Staring down at the boy, just as he had been staring down the long flight of stairs. ""Come on sport, We don't have time to be standing around.""

The boy knew not what to make of it all. A distance far greater then he had ever known. Far greater then the very ones he had always been left. Of those he had more recently learned had been meant to step, It only took a few before he took his first mis-step. Slick had become dust covered pads upon his pajama feet. Slick had become his dust covered rear left to thump along each step now that the boy had become just a blur, taken for a far more bumpy ride right down what had become his brand new slide.

Slow to spin upon two cheeks, slow to stop his slide off into the middle of the family room floor. Slow had not been the blur of his parents that now raced down these steps with far more grace, To help their boy that had already found his way back up upon two feet. Unsure what to make of a boy that so casually walked away. What wide eyed expressions they once had now forced to change, as a more inquisitive brow would be left to raise.

His mother first to call out to him as he passed her by. ""You aren't hurt anywhere, are you sweetie?""

The boy having seemed to ignore her very words, Now that he vanished through the opening that lead one to stumble upon the kitchen floor. To stare upon the dust that now paint the boy, and his backside in a different shade of gray.

His father had been heard calling from the other room, now that both parents had been left to follow the trail of dust the boy now left with each and every step he made. ""Now son, You should answer your mother when she'd talking to you.""

Hand of his mother now placed softly upon his father's arm. ""It's alright dear, I'll check him once I take him back up to change.""

Jack standing before an old man that had been doing his best to clean off the mix of slush and mud from his overalls. Grumbling and muttering to himself from the open door he had been left standing. Distant had been the canine to give chase to his brand new feathered friend. Long had it taken this old man to notice the boy's presence. Abrasive had been the gruffer scratch of this old man's tone.

""What kiddo, Never seen a little mud before?"" Jack had given a wordless answer. One from which had been a stare from the squinted eyes upon his now scrunched up face. One that would remain painted upon it now that he got to work.

All now paused in their movements, their steps. To watch this boy  make his way towards a kitchen chair. To grip upon it, horrible had been the sound of it's legs left to drag. Nearly press upon the old man's side now such horrid sounds had ended. The boy was left to climb, to stand upon the now dusty seat. To reach up to grip upon his wrinkled face. To stare this old man dead in the eye, to perform a single act of mimicry.

""You can run, But you can't hide scumbag."" Old man playing along for now. ""You'll never catch me copper, You or that mangy mutt of yours!""

Blank had become the expression of the boy now lifted from atop his chair, left to dangle beneath his mother's arm. Staring up at her now that she spoke in a more scolding tone. ""I don't like you speaking like that, Now let's get you changed so you can go out and play.""

His father left to stare now with his old man, upon the boy that was being taken up stairs. Only once mother and child vanished behind the wall would he look upon his father to speak. ""Any idea what all of that was about?""

""Your guess is as good as mine."" Words he never thought to hear from his father who had an answer for everything.

Old man left to run the kitchen faucet, to scrub at the stains left upon his mud colored clothes. Act his son saw as an exercise in futility. Seeming to swear under his breath as he scrubbed only helped confirm such an idle thought. Dead in his tracks now that he glanced out the window above the sink.

Witness to the canine's early morning antics. Catching the beast leap from atop the roof of the chicken coop. To give  knee deep mud  a mighty belly flop. Even from a distance some had managed to splat upon the very window from which he was watched. Enough to catch the attention of the boy's father. To stare out through the open door upon the muck covered pup. Muck that made a frightful plop as larger globs had been left to drip, to drop.

Hose heard in the background now that the boy left standing in a place he would barely fit. Through a hole the boy had crawled. One might assume the boy had been alone, had it not been for the clucking of those hidden within various cubbies. Yet this boy had not been staring upon those that had been  bok-bok-bawking, instead upon the larger pocket that lay sewn upon his chest. Both hands having been left to pull and hold it open, To reveal all it's secrets. Secrets that would now be reluctantly taken.

Like grains of an hourglass, grain now slipped through the boy's slowly uncurling fingers. To stare upon the pitter patter of corn that once released a crack of thunder beneath the old man's mighty hammer. About his feet now flocked those things that bawked as they walked, and between each and every peck they would make. The boy left to stare down upon another handful that had been taken, now given. To stare upon the feeding of these greedy clucking beaks, For even they could not match the gluttonous feasting of that which had come seeking, come peeking.

Caught within a tornado of feathers the brief moment these bok-bok-bawking things scattered. To seek shelter within the very cubbies that had become their safe haven. Canine left with tail wagging, to lap up the very grain the boy had been left holding. Mighty had been this canine's munching. As mighty as the greed of this beast that struggle to squeeze through the very hole he had come peeking. Blocking the only path of all those that had been desperately fleeing, desperately feeding from the hand from which the boy could no longer.

Small hand left to reach within the nest made of mother nature's trimmings. Gripping upon the warmer pearl from which one of these boking things had once been sitting. To stare upon it a long moment, from within the basket this pearl had been left to lay. To stare upon this all too familiar scene. One that changed with each and every pearl that would now lay beside this single pearl that had been filled with what could of been the warmth of life.

Creaking of a small door now opened, Blur of feathers of those that flooded free from this tiny place. Muttering heard from an old man left feathered. Hunched over to stare upon the boy that had been near eye level. To stare upon the beast that had been caught red handed in his feasting. Boy left to stare down at his  empty basket, Old man left to stare down upon the canine that stare back with his dumb dog impression.

""I don't know how that mutt of yours managed to squeeze his way in here, but get him out of here before there ain't anything left for breakfast.""

Old man left to stare upon the canine that now flopped upon his side, to roll over upon one, and back to the other, for every wag his tail gave, now spread the muck of his earlier play, Rolling was all it took for this muck covered beast to dawn a coat made of mocking feathers.

""I ain't buying it."" Canine giving a huff, Slowly getting upon all fours to stare the hunched over man eye to eye, Rex slowly passing this old man by. Boy doing much the same, to pause and offer the old man a handful of his secret treasure. ""Come on kid, Give me a break. I've had enough antics for one morning.""

Left to listen to the munching of the boy that passed him by. ""Wait kid, Don't go eating that, you'll end up losing all your teeth.""

Old man left on kitchen duty, While his father had been left scraping muck off the ceiling, While his mother had been left dusting the upstairs ceiling. Boy left standing just outside the door with hose in hand. Staring the canine eye to eye that had been left sitting upon his hunches at the bottom of the steps. Neither moving now that the boy had been tasking with washing away the muck upon Rex's play. Unsure just how he had washed clean, from the single spot atop the canine's head the water had been left flowing.

His mother, His father both left exhausted. Having finished their task at hand. Both trying to help the old man cook, Only to be brushed aside. ""Come on dad, At least let me cook the bacon.""

Mix of tobacco and burning grease filling the kitchen. ""What, Got something against my cooking?""

""Come on dad, Why don't you go grab a few eggs and let me take over, Or at least watch Jack so he doesn't burn our toast.""

His mother having been busy setting the table, pulling a few plates from an overhead cupboard. ""Leave your father be, If he wants to cook, let him. We're guests here after all.""

""None of that, you hear?, This is as much your home as it is mine."" Spatula left to point.

Old man ignoring the bacon that looked to be smoking. His father left pacing, to stare upon the skillet that might erupt at any moment. Smoking grease now left to drain, to pour over a fresh pan the old man had been cracking each egg with a single hand gesture. Colorful had been the small pieces of shell confetti. Thick had been the smoke that now masked the smell of the toast the boy had been burning within the child sized skillet he had been holding. Watching the flickering of this fresh piece of charcoal burning.

""Think that's enough help from you little mister."" Lid forced down to cover the burning bread, His mother removing the child sized skillet from the open flame. Old man left to snuff out the flames that would erupt from the bacon, His father left to take over the eggs while all but the boy had been left to scramble all the same. ""Grab a plate, Breakfast's Ready.""

By time all was said and done, Kitchen table had been filled with all manor of extra crispy things that loosely resemble the breakfast meats that they were suppose to be. Each piece left dripping of extra burnt grease. Yet none could compare to the slices of toast the boy now passed out to each of the family's plates.

With the number a life time of chain smoking did to the old man's taste buds, He couldn't taste the burnt left on his plate. Shame the kid had been the only one to appreciate his cooking, How he'd been wolfing it down and all. If only his own kid wasn't so damn picky. Yet something about the look both this kid's parent's gave just didn't sit quite right, how they'd been staring at the kid, from behind those untouched plates.

""What's gotten into the two of you?"" Old man paused mid bite, giving them a look that involved a raised brown, and extra scrunched up face. ""Acting like you've never seen the kid scarf down his breakfast before.""

""To be frank dad, Neither of us have."" Couldn't even imagine how loud the crunch his father made trying to bite down upon his slice of what could of been extra crispy bacon. ""Really is the darnest thing, how anyone would enjoy your extra special style of cooking.""

""Watch it now, You aren't too old to be placed over my knee."" Slurping from a coffee mug heard, thud soon followed. ""You just haven't learned to appreciate the finer things.""

Look on his mother's face, having been at such a loss of words of the situation, Left to start second guessing her cooking. Left to stare down at her own plate, One given to the charred scramble of what still looked to be eggs. None taking notice of the hand full of feed the boy now sprinkle atop what had been left of his scramble, to give it a little extra seasoning.

""It's nice to see him finally eating."" His mother finally found at least something to say. 

""Think I should take a few lessons from your father."" Unsure if this had been a question or a statement.

Smile upon his father's face now that he placed a extra special kiss upon the back of her hand, he held. ""Your cooking is wonderful dear, Wouldn't want dad ruining it now, would we?""

Between held hands a small child's would be seen, reaching for the slice of toast that had been left upon the edge of his mother's plate. Only to have his hand caught, and held between  his parent's now. Both now  stare down at their son that had been trying to reach for  a handful of his father's neglected scramble.

""Alright wise guy, You can clean up all this mess."" Old man having finished what was left of his plate, knocking back what was left in his coffee mug. Creaking of footsteps heard along the kitchen floors, Now that this old man made his way towards a door hidden behind the underside of the longer flight of stairs. Heavy had been this door the old man struggled to open, one that only opened with an extra special knock of this old man's pounding fist. ""Damn thing's stuck again."" 

Knew not just where this moving wall of iron would lead. Even now that the boy had been left standing before it, to stare down into the heart of darkness these steps lead. Voice of the old man heard from far below, within that distant red glow. ""Damnit I forgot to close the door, now it's ruined."" Slow had been the boy to close the door he had been left standing, to await the return of this old man from what felt to be no man's land. A place only this old man was allowed to tread. 

Land from which The Detective would return, Side glance given to his son that had been left finishing a few final adjusting of each cuff that belonged to a freshly pressed jacket. Upon his daughter that had been pulling upon a heel of her own now that she finished tying the loops upon each of the boy's shoes. Loops from which the boy had been left to stare, down passed the overalls he had been left to wear. Overalls that only shown through the open front of his usual costume. Unaware of The Detective that now placed the missing piece upon his head. 

""Looking sharp kiddos, I'll see you all half passed supper."" Old man seeming to be in a far more chipper mood, now that he had been back within his own skin. 

""We will see you later dad."" His father left wearing his usual not-casual outing skin.

""Hope he won't give you too much trouble."" His mother left wearing a colorful looking dress. Colors that often did not match the rest, to stand out amongst those wearing similar dull dress skins.

Jack following after his parent's now that his father reached to open the front door. Only to find he couldn't move now that his coat had become snagged upon something. That something which had been The Detective's hand. ""Just where do you think you're going? Those parent's of yours got far too much to do today, to keep their eye on you. You'll be riding with me today."" 

Never seen the kid look back and forth so quick in my life. Even if he didn't show it, looked as if his mind was about to explode. Looking as if needed reassurance from his parent's this hadn't been some cruel joke played at his expense. ""Come on Kid, Really that hard to believe?"" 

Hand placed upon the boy's shoulder now that his father would lower himself down to one knee. ""Now son, I want you to do your best not to let him out of your sight, No telling what sorta mess The Hound will get stuck in otherwise."" 

Squinted had been the gaze from the scrunched up face. Looking his father dead in the eye now that he had been near eye level. ""He's got no where left to run."" 

""Atta boy."" Softer pats upon his shoulder, now that his father turned back to pull open the front door, To find a certain menace sitting at their door step. One that had been left to sulk, to huff as he slowly made his way right inside, to walk passed all those that had been present without so much as a glance. For all Rex could think, was how he missed out on all those extra crispy, extra special looking things that should of been his treats. From within a jacket pocket the boy now reached, to pull free the half of what had been an extra treat. One left sprinkled with extra special pocket seasoning. One knew not how fast this canine's tail could wag. Left to lay, to gnaw at this extra special gift he had received, now left behind, now closed doors. 

Beside the window of the door he sat, The boy had been left to stare out upon the endless mud filled seas. To drive along salted earth that looked to part these very mud filled seas, Towards a town seen far off and distant. Like a distant after thought that had been placed before mountains that served as a backdrop Mountains so tall they pierced through the thicker charcoal blanket that distant sky had been tucked behind. Strange for they had been the only mountains in both sight, and range. Mountains encased in ice that left them to glow the slightest from early morning light. 

Wasn't until they had nearly reached the edge of town, to cross from what had once been salted earth turned to layered brick. Seldom few had been the trees that sprout up about this island within these muddy waters. Stranger yet how such brick work now split to run long each side of what had been made of boiling ichor pulled from the depths of dead seas, filled with ancient things. With it would bring the more familiar scenes of this ever moving picture. Left to glance over at the one that had been beside him.

Elbow left to rest upon an open window, just as the cigar had been left to rest between his lips. Expression upon his face looking like one that had been trying to think upon far too many things. Things that grew with every stop they made. Quick had been this one to leap from the car they sat, Leaving the door open, and car running. Each stop couldn't of lasted more then a few minutes. Giving the boy time to watch the scenes unfold from across the street. Of those that did their best, living each and every day. Abrasive voice heard once more from behind the wheel now that the boy's moving picture had once more slowed, to stop. ""I'll be right back kiddo."" Left to mutter under his breath. ""Maybe now they'll give you something that's meant to be eaten""

Having stopped at the corner of the only crossroads the boy had seen within this far off town Or along this very road for that matter. Wasn't long until the picture would start to move once more from the front of the seat he had been latched. To pass by the single tower that could be seen from the new home he stay. Serving as a beacon to a town that might otherwise not been there. The only tower called City Hall. The one behind the wheel taking a moment to adjust the rear view mirror to catch a glimpse of the boy that had been staring back upon him from his reflection. Screeching of wheels of the car that now swerved, and left to nearly spin. Voice of the one behind the wheel. 

""Jesus Kid, How long have you been sitting there?"" As abrasive as this tone had been, It had not been The Detectives.

This man finished adjusting the mirror now that he look back over his shoulder to double check he had not been seeing things. ""Mind not looking at me kid, That look of yours is giving me the creeps. More so then that toy you left in the back seat."" 

Gaze that had been staring at him from the mirror's reflection now turned towards that sky blue, pristine looking plush rabbit that was now in view from the back seat. Having been left sitting right behind the boy. ""People need to learn to stitch these days. Look at how half of it has already come undone."" 

This man really didn't know between which of the two unnerved him more, This kid that acted like he was a doll, or this doll that gave a more human stare. Either way, Least their had been a radio in his new ride, To take his mind off this creeping feeling that slowly crawled beneath his skin. Even if it took a bit through all the crackling pops, and high pitched hums of static to find a frequency that worked.

📻 *Goooooooood morning folks! What a beautiful start to this brand new day!*

 *Enjoy it while it lasts folk! We've got one heck of a storm rolling in this eve-* 

Popping static of high pitched screams heard from the talking box now that this man had been left to twist upon the dial once more. The boy couldn't help but wonder just how tiny the man had been, to fit inside this even smaller box that had become his home. 

📻 *Buried beneath another round of snow, In other news it seems Santa Clause wasn't the only one prowling the streets late last night, As we've just received word The Hunter has struck again late christmas eve, Lea-* 

tiny man left sounding as if his mouth had been foaming with static as he let out one more high pitched scream, gargling every word he now tried to speak, As this man had been relentless in his twisting of the dial that sounded as if it had taken hold of this tiny man by the neck.

*📻""A real Christmas miracle folks, How that family managed to get away from that brutal attack inside there home.* 

*If it was me, I'd of probably ended up like that other guy. . . Or gal? They ever figure out who was behind the wheel?""* 

""Thanks to that guy, Coppers got their hands to full, to be worrying about the likes of me."" Man had been far to focused upon tuning the radio to take notice now that only static filled the air. Too late to notice notice of what had been sitting in the middle of the road he had been taking out of town, Only to catch a glimpse of those shimmering eyes that had been awaiting him. Ones that lead this man to make one last, final mistake as he swerved to miss this stray. Having been pushing the engine to it's limits from which breaks would no longer work, and could only break, To how sharp a turn he would try to make, To leave the very world to spin within the spiraling that had become this man's fate. A fate that could of been avoided had he not been so focused upon listening to what could of been his brand new car, radio. 

Latched firmly upon his seat, Jack had been left to watch all loose things float and rapidly spin within this car that felt to have forgotten the very notion that had been known as gravity. To watch the man that had been behind the wheel to twist and bend in impossible ways that left him blurred within his impossible spin. For how fast had the world been spinning to keep the boy's hat latch upon the top of his very head. Only to fall now that the world around him would slow. To lay upon the ceiling that had become his new floor, filled with shattered glass mixed with crimson paint. The boy left to stare down from the seat he had been left both sitting, and still latched. Of the subtle dripping of paint that broke the silence that followed the horrific death screams the car called ford had only since recently been making.

At least by the sound of things, The little man in the box had still been speaking, if rather weakly, For eyes that had been left blinking upon the small box that made it look sleepy.

📻 *Ru\_  \_ab\_ \_t""* 

Motionless had been the tangle mess of twisted and broken limbs, Of a head that looked to have been shoved between legs curling back like fingers in opposite directions. Arms that looked to have become tied in a knot behind the head that lay twisted in the opposite, tilted position, Twisted like the torso that took upon a shape more akin to a wound up spring. Motionless broken by the sudden rapid twitching of each and every one of these twisted limbs, For those twitching eyes that now hang out from each socket, wrapped about both steering wheel, and unworn seat belt.

📻 ***\_****un! r****\_ \_ \_****it r\_ \_!*

Jack left to slowly reach towards the dial, to twist it a bit so that the little man might better speak. 

📻 *D\_n't  \_ \_ve  \_he farmer his fun!*

Had Jack not been so focused upon turning the dials of this car radio, He might of noticed just whom had been staring at him from his broken window. For it had been Mr. Rabbit come to visit from the back seat he had once been sitting. Looking extra clean, despite the crimson glass painted across the back seat. Crimson paint that now splatter upon the boy all the same. Pristine had been the very plush of fabric skin this thing called Mr. Rabbit had been left wearing.

1qiiww4,https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnSomali/comments/1qiiww4/how_our_ancestors_built_a_linguistic_algorithm/,How Our Ancestors Built a Linguistic Algorithm Thousands of Years Ago.,"While working on the etymology of Somali names ([somaliname.com](http://somaliname.com/) previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnSomali/comments/1pip07x/the_most_detailed_somali_names_resource_online/)), something clicked in my mind, and now I see Somali words differently. The examples below are just surface-level observations, meant to show the most accessible layer of meaning before getting into deeper, more structural patterns.

For example, when you ask someone their age in Somali, the word used is **da**. It is rooted in weather, with **da** meaning rain, so asking someone their '*da’* is essentially asking how many rain seasons, or **Gu**, they have lived through.

Another example is the word **agoon** (orphan). It combine **ag**, meaning near or by, and **oon**, meaning thirst. Conceptually, this presents the orphan as someone who exists close to deprivation. In a nomadic pastoral society, thirst and hunger are existential conditions. When a child loses their father, the primary provider is gone, placing the child in a state symbolically near thirst and hunger even if food and water still exist.

I have also come up with some personal theories about how certain words may have been formed. One example is the Somali word for the number four, **afar**. My theory is that it is a descriptive term made up of **af** meaning mouth and **far** meaning finger/thumb. When a child sucks their thumb (the thumb is in the mouth,) leaving four visible fingers. The number is identified by what remains.

Our ancestors didn’t just create words, they created a system, an algorithm, that could generate new words for things that didn’t even exist thousands of years ago. Every morpheme carries a core conceptual meaning, whether about containment, emergence, or crystallization, and nothing is random. This system encodes how concepts relate to the world, the body, society, and thought, allowing speakers not only to describe what already exists, but to invent words for new technologies, ideas, or phenomena that had never been imagined. In a sense, Somali is timeless and forward-looking: the logic our ancestors embedded allows us to create meaningful words for the modern age, and even for things that will emerge in the future. Even more amazingly, it allows us to **map words backwards** and uncover the meaning of words we might have no idea about today, revealing the conceptual structure hidden within the language. And yet, over time, much of this understanding has been lost. We rely on loanwords from other languages, forgetting that our own language contains a deep, precise, and surprisingly algorithmic system capable of mapping life itself across time. Studying Somali morphemes like **-uur**, **-ax**, and **-ti** gives a glimpse into this ancient genius, a system that is elegant, logical, and endlessly creative. Every suffix, prefix, infix, or even a standalone word can be isolated and grouped within a category.

In Somali, the suffix **–uur** marks things that are **held, enclosed, or contained**. It’s about what is **inside, nurtured, or surrounded**, whether physically, biologically, or socially. Think of it as the suffix that emphasizes **internality, protection, or accumulation,** like something kept within a boundary, whether it’s life inside a womb (*uur*), water in the clouds (*daruur*), or children growing within a family (*caruur,*) -uur is tied to the idea of **uur**.

**abuur** → (ab + uur) life **enclosed** within matter

**uur** → biological life **enclosed** in the womb

**caruur** → people who **developed within** an a family and also from uur and guur

**baruur** → body **enveloped by** stored substance

**buur** → earth **gathered into** an enclosing mass

**daruur** → water **contained within** a surrounding mass

**duur** → dense land that **surrounds and engulfs**

**cambuur** → garment that **encloses the body**

**baabuur** → structure that **encloses and carries** people

**huur** → heat that **immerses and surrounds** the body

**guur** → entry into a **new enclosed unit** (household)

**aruur** → bringing things **into one enclosure**

**tuur** → **hatchback** — a container **shaped by what it carries inside**

**faruur** → **edge of enclosure** (mouth) where inside meets outside

**fuur** → corpse **swollen from internal gases**, body **expanded and filled from within**

The original title for this post was ""**Dayuur/Dayuurad** is a Somali word and **Diyaarad** is not."" I used to think the opposite and always wondered why some people call airplanes *dayuurad* when everyone else says *diyaarad*. Turns out *diyaarad* is just a transliteration of the Arabic word ***ṭayyārah*** (with variations across Arabic dialects) and doesn't follow any Somali morpheme rules. Sure, ***diyaar*** means ""ready,"" so you could argue it suggests express transportation, but that interpretation doesn't reconcile with how other Somali words are structured. On the flip side, *dayuur/dayuurad* makes perfect sense: the **da** prefix marks emergence into visible motion or effect from an elevated state, whether lightning, moonlight, or clouds, and it's not random that *daxay*, *danab*, and *daruur* all share this prefix. The uur suffix works just like it does in *baabuur*, meaning a structure that encloses and carries people. So *dayuur/dayuurad* correctly maps to a vessel that carries from above and moves visibly through space, a perfectly logical Somali word we replaced with a loanword.

**–ax (emergence / externalization)**

The suffix **–ax** is all about **coming out, breaking through, or emerging**. It marks things that **move from inside → outside**, whether physically, biologically, or metaphorically. Everything with –ax is tied to the idea of **bax,** emergence, release, or exposure from **madax** (head, first out at birth and the part of the body through which speech exits) to **qorax** (sun, constantly emitting light) to **malax** (pus coming out of a wound). It’s the suffix of **manifestation and externalization**.

**bax** → to exit, go out, sprout

**cawrax** → dryness (internal moisture gone → external state)

**dhagax** → stone (matter hardened and exposed)

**dhiigbax** → bleeding (blood exiting the body)

**farax** → a name/word meaning joy or happiness (emotion coming out)

**fax** → rushing, gushing out

**galax** → fresh milk or water, or the vessel for it (designed to pour out)

**galayax** → untidy, unwieldy (things spilling out beyond containment)

**kalax** → ladle, water dipper, or cup (tool for extracting/pouring)

**kax** → barren land or desert (land exposed; life has left)

**lax** → black-headed sheep (stands out, externally visible, like **madax**)

**nax** → to be startled or frightened (internal shock bursts outward)

**qalax** → stony desert (land stripped, exposed)

**qarax** = explosion / blast (something contained is suddenly released and manifests externally.)

**qax** → evacuation, fleeing (mass exit)

**qorax** → sun (energy continuously emitted outward)

**sax** → correct, exact (clarity revealed, externalized truth)

**tax** → to thread, align, or arrange (organizing things so they’re externally legible)

**wax** → a thing, matter, or something (something that has emerged into existence metaphorically or physically)

**madax** → head (first thing to come out at birth; leading point of emergence, speech exits)

**adhax** → spine / backbone (internal structure that defines emergence and support; central axis from which movement and form project outward)

**malax** → pus (matter coming out from a wound; internal → external)

**–ti (crystallization / recognition)**

On the other hand, **–ti** is the suffix of **closure, stabilization, and recognition**. It takes something **open, potential, or ongoing** and turns it into a **settled, fixed, or socially recognized state**. For example, movement becomes a **marti** (guest), speech capacity becomes an **afti** (opinion), and fleeing becomes a **qaxooti** (refugee). While –ax is about things emerging, **–ti** is about **those things being fixed, acknowledged, and crystallized**.

|**Base**|**–ti form**|**Open / unstable**|**Crystallized / recognized state**|**Notes**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
||||||
|**ab**|**abti**|lineage / ancestry|maternal uncle (terminal male in lineage)|Lineage continuity stops here|
|**baq**|**baqti**|decay / fear|death|Biological / emotional process reaches terminal state|
|**af**|**afti**|mouth / speech capacity|opinion / referendum|Discussion / consent crystallized|
|**arag**|**aragti**|seeing|reflection / viewpoint / thought|Perception crystallized|
|**gal**|**galti**|entering / motion|foreigner|Social identity fixed|
|**gashaan**|**gashaanti**|lovers / couple|girl of marriageable age|Social / biological threshold reached|
|**han**|**hanti**|ambition / pride|wealth / possession|Aspirational desire crystallized|
|**kar**|**karti**|ability / potential|capability / strength / competence|Open potential becomes recognized trait|
|**mar**|**marti**|movement / passing|guest / visitors|Social presence fixed|
|**qax**|**qaxooti**|fleeing / escaping|refugee|Social/legal status fixed|

btw: i do understand the common spelling is bakhti and not baqti but the origin points to baq + -ti

**Reverse Example: ra+ti**

* **rati = male camel**
   * **ra-** = male / masculine classifier
   * **–ti** = fixed, recognized state

**Interpretation:** The broad concept of *rag (men/masculine)* is anchored to the camel domain and then crystallized by **ti** into a stable, socially recognized category, **male camel**.

You might challenge this and say that **ra-** does not mean male/masculine, and I too initially doubted this while reverse-engineering the word. I considered that **ra** might be an ancient root partially lost over time. Then I remembered the Somali word **rag**, meaning “men” or “masculine,” and realized that the final consonant can drop when combining a masculine root with a feminine suffix. A similar process occurs with **bil** (“month”) when forming **bisha** (“the month”), where the **L** is dropped. In the same way, the **G** in **rag** is dropped to form **rati** instead of **ragti**. Consonant reduction, doubling, vowel stretching or shifting is common in Somali morphology.

**Pattern:** prefix introduces the subset or classifier → suffix **–ti** fixes it into a stable, recognized entity.  
In Somali, the suffix **-ti** is a **directional derivational marker**, establishing a one-way relationship between the derived form and its root. The derived form necessarily **entails the root**, but the root does **not automatically entail the derived form**. For example, *abti* (maternal uncle) presupposes belonging to the *ab* (lineage), but not every member of the lineage is an *abti*. *Marti* (guest) presupposes that someone has *mar* (passed through), yet merely passing through does not make one a *marti*. Likewise, *qaxooti* (refugee) presupposes that someone has *qax* (fled), but not everyone who flees is a *qaxooti*, since they may simply be internally displaced. Every **rati** (male camel) is **rag** but not all rag are **rati** . This asymmetry is the defining property of -ti: it **selects a specific, recognized subset of the root’s domain** and fixes it as a socially or functionally terminal state. Unlike English suffixes such as **-ee** (employ → *employee*, train → *trainee*, pay → *payee*) are only partially directional and easily break down with words like *free*, *coffee*, *tree*, or *degree*, showing that English lacks a **productive, semantically invariant, and directional suffix** comparable to Somali **-ti**.which are lexically restricted and inconsistent, Somali -ti is **productive, semantically invariant, and directional**, making it a robust morphological mechanism across the language.

Back to my point about how Somali encodes mechanisms for creating new words. The Somali word for *satellite* is **dayax-gacmeed**. The **dayax** component conveys something elevated or in the sky, but semantically it is already reserved for the moon. The appended **gacmeed** literally means “hand-made,” so the compound as a whole describes a *man-made object in the sky*. While this construction is perfectly valid in Somali, it functions more as a descriptive workaround than as a word generated organically through the language’s internal morphemic system.

Our ancestors, however, left us with productive building blocks capable of generating new terms, just as they did with words like *airplane*. Using those native morphemes, we can construct a term for *satellite* without relying on descriptive add-ons:

* **da-** → emergence into visibility / from an elevated state (operation in the sky)
* **-yuur** → vessel, carrier, enclosure
* **-ax** → emission, release, or externalized effect (such as signals or radiation)

Combined, these yield:

**Dayuurax** — literally, *“a sky-borne carrier that emits.”*

This construction reflects a satellite’s actual function: an object operating above that carries and emits signals. More importantly, it demonstrates that Somali’s morphemic system is forward-looking, capable of describing technologies that did not exist thousands of years ago while remaining internally logical and semantically precise.

That said, I’m not disregarding the fact that **dayax** itself can be analyzed morphologically:

* **day-** → look (seeing, search)
* **-ax** → emission, externalization

Under this analysis, **dayax** is interpreted as *“that which manifests to enable seeing”* or *“guide-light.”* This interpretation does not contradict the **da-** sense of emergence or elevation; rather, it reinforces it, positioning the moon as a ""guiding light that appears from above.""",4,1768955730.0,LearnSomali,0,1.0,False

I'm a 24-year-old Orthodox Christian guy living in Show Low, Arizona (yes, the mountains and pines out here are beautiful, but winters can test your patience with fasting rules). I've been part of the Eastern Orthodox Church for some time now, after a long journey through various Protestant groups, a season of serious doubt that slid into agnosticism, with a Nordic Pagan background, I'm finally finding my home in Orthodoxy.

What drew me in (and keeps me here) is the depth and continuity: the unchanged Divine Liturgy that echoes back to the early centuries, the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, the teachings of the Church Fathers that feel timeless rather than trendy, the emphasis on theosis (becoming partakers of the divine nature), and the honest acknowledgment that we're all sinners in need of constant repentance and grace. No sugar-coating sin, no quick-fix prosperity gospel—just the narrow path, the sacraments, the Jesus Prayer, icons, fasting, and the lives of the saints as real guides.

I'm far from perfect. My prayer rule is spotty some days, I still get frustrated in traffic, struggle with pride and judging others, and I'm learning (slowly) what it means to love my neighbor as myself in everyday life. But the Church's medicine—the confession, the Eucharist, the liturgical rhythm—keeps pulling me back and healing what I break.

I'm posting this AMA because I'd love to answer questions from anyone curious about Orthodox Christianity. Feel free to ask anything:

Why Orthodoxy over Catholicism, Protestantism, or other paths?

What’s daily life like as an Orthodox guy in rural America (fasting during football season is... interesting)?

How do icons, the Jesus Prayer, or theosis actually work in practice?

Struggles with sin, prayer dryness, or parish life?

Differences in theology (filioque, original sin, Mary, saints, etc.)?

Or even random stuff like: favorite saints, best fasting recipes (or complaints about no coffee), what it's like attending Liturgy with kids/families, etc.

No question is too basic, too challenging, or too weird—I'm happy to share my experience as a regular layman trying to live this ancient faith today. If I don't know something, I'll say so and point you toward good resources (priests, books, etc.).

Pray for me, a sinner. Looking forward to your questions!",3,1768955665.0,AskMeAnythingIAnswer,4,1.0,False

Figured I’d share that I recently started my own AV company. I’ve been working in audio / video for well over a decade and finally decided to jump into doing my own thing.

If you’re building a space, putting on an event, working on an art project, or just trying to make your home setup sound or look better, I’m happy to help or even just point you in the right direction.

A little background:

•I’ve worked major conventions, gallery openings, corporate events, etc. (gear + crews + making things actually work 😅)

•Spent 6 years as an installer at MoMA in NYC working on artist installations

•I’m especially excited to collaborate with artists and offer sliding-scale rates when possible

•Also do home stuff: smart home setups, home theaters, hi-fi stereo systems (digital + analog)

Not here to hard sell anything — mostly just saying hi and letting folks know I exist if you ever need a hand with something AV-related.

I started mounjaro in August and so far have lost about 20kg and have kind of made it into double digits which I am so happy about. On December 23rd I was 100kg and currently I am 98kg but have been going up and down between 98kg and about 102kg since December.. I'm on 10mg but at my last Dr appointment I asked to be lowered down to 7.5mg which starts next week - I'm still not sure if this is a good idea.

I asked for my dose to be put down because my ADHD meds have been increased and so I'm also getting a bit of suppression from that. On top of that I have ARFID and autism and am currently in my 'all food is bad/gross and I can't eat' phase that I go through every few months. So safe to say I have only been getting by on coffee, leg ham and pickles with the odd protein drink every now and again. I thought maybe I was somehow going over in my calories but I tracked it again for a few days and I'm only managing about 800 on a very good day, and not anywhere near my protein goals. So I think its that I'm not eating enough that could be causing it, hence asking for the lower dose.

Does anyone have any tips on getting through the plateau despite this probably unique situation? Or just tips on not getting discouraged from this?

1qiio6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1qiio6a/coworker_crush/,Co-worker Crush,"Hello,

I (27m) have a thing for my coworker(33f), and have for the last two years, since I promoted to a new department. We made friends very quickly, though we only shared a couple hours of our shift. Recently I changed shift, and now we spent 4/6 hours together.

I could hold back feelings when it was such little contact, but now it's blossomed to something I can't really ignore. All the signs are there, she's said she likes me (definitely platonically, but nonetheless bluntly),  and we even joke with some heavy innuendo almost every day. 

Thing is, when we met, she just met her current boyfriend. They now live together, but any time he's brought up, she shuts down, or she explicitly explains problems with him, and I've tried to get anything positive about him out of her but she can't, other than her physical attraction. I've asked her point blank if he proposed would she say yes, she's said it would be a no.

All of this to say I need advice. We've both admitted that our shifts are a lot nicer together, time flies faster these days, etc. Because we get to chat more. So, we've decided to get coffee as friends, which will be our first hang out outside of work ever. 

I'm very tempted to just logically explain my crush to her. I've confessed to a coworker before, and it blew up in my face, I'd just like to go about things differently. I know if I'm rejected I can deal with it, it's the not knowing and the hoping that's eating me up right now. 

TLDR; I have a crush on my coworker who is taken, should I even bother confessing?",2,1768955122.0,Crushes,1,1.0,False

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says to me.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf in my head.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat and loads up my bags.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I can manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and damage we do fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chucking it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will enquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf did not touch anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says to me.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf in my head.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat and loads up my bags.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I can manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and damage we do fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chucking it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will enquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf did not touch anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

I put my head down, close my eyes and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and damage we do fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chucking it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will enquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf did not touch anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

My fibroid (10 cm) isnʻt a good candidate for surgical removal because it would compromise the integrity of my uterus and Iʻm trying to have another baby (I had one baby already, thatʻs when I discovered the fibroid at 8cm, it was not an issue before or during pregnancy). Since I had my kid, my periods have been insanely heavy, crazy clotting, with PMS symptoms I never had before. Iʻve had two miscarriages which have been heartbreaking for me. 

  
Iʻm pursing a consultation with UCLA for UAE, but I came across a podcast about something called the bean protcol. I figured in the meantime I would try it. It's been two months, and my last two periods have been light, and manageable. I'm shocked. It's not an easy protocol to follow (no sugar, caffeine, or dairy, and lots of beans, veg and protein) but it's definitely working. I just wanted to put it out there for anyone who might be as desperate as I am that they'd be willing to forego coffee and sugar.

1qiifq2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qiifq2,"Oriole ** Chicago, Jan 2026","So for context and comparison, in the last year I've been to 3 other two-stars: Aquavit (NYC), Acquerello (SF), Acquolina (Rome), and a couple one-stars - Zia (Rome) + EL Ideas (Chicago). Plus a few restaurants in areas that don't pay for Michelin that I think would get a star or two e.g. Nodoguro in Portland.

  
Nodoguro's sous chef told me Oriole was his favorite restaurant in Chicago (having lived and worked there) so it was my choice for this year's visit & it was simply a highlight of my life; it exceeded my extremely high expectations. In case it helps anyone, I rank these Oriole > Acquerello >>>> Nodoguro >> Acquolina > Zia > EL Ideas (Aquavit was just 6 courses at lunch but it'd be up with the top 2 based on how everything there was perfect). That's also more or less in order of price :)

\------------------------------

  
Oriole ended up **$516 a person** including tax+tip+n/a drink pairing. Thus far for me, not only does the experience get better the more I pay but it seems to get *exponentially* better - Oriole was twice the price of EL Ideas in the same city and I'd say four times better, certainly. 17 courses, 14 of them made my list of best things I've ever eaten, including a couple top-5s that nearly made me cry and 5 more top-20/30s. For reference Acquerello was 22 courses (11x2 different menus) with also 14 making that list. 

  
Courses 1-3 are at the bar with a shellfish+fruit theme. The **abalone** was wonderfully smoky and the kombu and buddha hand both did their jobs perfectly, amazing first bite. PEI blue **mussel** with yuzu kosho/finger lime/mussel mousse was one of the best oceany/briny bites I've ever had. **Scallop** with persimmon and persimmon granita was just very good, I didn't get enough from the fruit to elevate it beyond that.

Course 4 in the kitchen, toast with **foie gras mousse**, liquid nitro'd creme fraiche pearls, kind of a fig jam. Not unique but tremendously tasty, perfect texture + temp contrast. It's foie gras, it's like a cheat code when it's done right & it was. Incredibly good drink paired with this, a cherry-thyme verjus/spiced chamomile thing. 

Rest of the courses are at the dining table. **Hojicha custard** with potato, toasted wheat berries, potato, & caviar -- wonderfully nutty, caviar was more of a back note but it wasn't a $$ supplement so that's a-OK. The **cauliflower** was more or less a salad, chaud-froid cooked hot served cold, stunning texture on the cauliflower itself (silky and creamy outside but still a lot of bite to the inside, never had anything similar) and lovely flavors. 

The **uni infladita** is a puffed crispy tortilla filled with tiger prawn and morita pepper and pickled watermelon radish, topped with uni, & it's the first thing that made me want to cry. This is why I go to places like this, there's very little else in life that makes me feel as good as food at this level, it was absolutely perfect, the heat level was so precisely right, the crispy tortilla & flavor from the masa, the richness, I just had to close my eyes and make the moment last as long as possible. Will never forget it, one of my top 5 bites ever. 

The cup o **mushrooms** was enokis over a king trumpet custard, matsutakes from my area (PNW), & a mushroom consomme poured over. The best mushroomy dish I've ever had, three flavors and texutres of fungus that all worked perfectly together, tremendously rich custard with lovely delicate enokis. Another standout drink pairing with this, genmaicha & hojicha with a ginger-maple shrub. The **sablefish** (my favorite fish & another PNW specialty) was perfectly cooked and the white asparagus in the foam went with it *so* well, and the textures of the rices, the nutty chestnut, one of the best fish dishes I've had. At least as good as the king salmon at Aquavit. 

The **venison** with truffle was excellent but I want to talk about the little pastry that came with it, the chocolate/coffee **canele** next to the spine bones. This was another top 5 thing I've ever had. The A5 **wagyu** with various accoutrements was great fun mixing and matching the flavors together, every bite different. 

The **lemon/rosemary** palate cleanser did its job but wasn't memorable (the best I've had was at Vetri in Philly, a celery sorbet with candied coriander seed, so I know they can be memorable while also wiping your slate clean). The **golden milk** **desert** was on the low end of my top 5 desserts ever, lovely contrast with rich and light, hot and cold, sweet and bitter. And finally all 3 **mignardises** were very good though the apple/sage tarte was the only really outstanding one, never had a texture quite like the apple layer, very silky.

The N/A pairing added a huge amount to the experience & splitting it is the way to go imo (you still get plenty of each, sips go a long way)

\----------------------------

Overall it's my #1 ranked restaurant and it's the best way to spend 3 hours and $500 that I know of, as far as adding value & happiness to my life goes. It was a very similar experience to driving the icefields parkway in the Canadian Rockies, in that one can only be so amazed so many times in a row before it kinda gets overwhelming and I just need time to process everything that just happened. 12/10 on the best flavor, 16/10 on flavor variety, my highest ranked restaurant with a 28/20.

I’m looking for a partner, someone that’s my best friend and that I can connect with.

I like baking, reading, watching Netflix, painting, video podcasts and staying active. This year I’ve promised myself to get into more of a healthier lifestyle, meet more people and really pursue passions outside of work. 

Hot take for the evening - because nothing is better than a little controversy - winter should be a month max. We don’t need half the year in a frigid ice box. 

Looking for someone successful in their career (white collar professionals or entrepreneurs are what I gravitate towards) kind, respectful, funny, emotionally available and with good EQ. Also age-appropriate ( late thirties upwards) and EST would be great. 

Also if you’re from somewhere other than near Toronto, please be OK with the distance, like really OK :) I understand a LDR isn’t for everyone and hopefully you’re self-aware enough to know if you can handle one or not. 

If you feel we would gel, write back with a bit about yourself (I don’t respond to low-effort ‘hey’ messages) and the word ‘coffee’ so I know you have read this far :)

1qiibq0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qiibq0,Margaux 10 Kata Factory vs. Black Frame,"I’ve been on the hunt for the perfect Margaux 10, and I think Black Frame Factory comes very close.

Disclaimer: I don’t own the authentic, but I’ve handled real ones in person.

Seller: Baobao — she’s always super quick to reply and very honest. I really appreciate her feedback, and she never gaslights me.

I originally wanted the Margaux 10 from The Row, but I didn’t want the grained leather since it felt a bit too casual for what I was looking for. I wanted something more luxe, so saddle leather made more sense to me. With that said, here’s the review.

⸻

Kata Factory – 6/10

Margaux 10 | Coffee Saddle Leather | Silver Hardware

💰 Paid $182 + shipping

The leather is extremely dry. I’ve conditioned it with Bick 4 five times, and it’s still dry as hell. There’s honestly no saving it — the leather alone is a dead giveaway that it’s a rep.

That said, the construction is solid. The stitching is good, and the bag feels sturdy and well-made. The logo stamping is a bit thick and not perfect, but it doesn’t really bother me. The straps are thicker than black frames so I’m not sure if that’s a big call out. If it weren’t for the leather (and the logo), I’d actually feel confident wearing this.

PS. If anyone wants this, I’m selling it! 

⸻

Black Frame Factory – 9/10

Margaux 10 | Black Saddle Leather | Gold Hardware

💰 Paid $329 + shipping

The saddle leather is 1000% better than Kata. It’s the closest I’ve felt to authentic — soft, buttery, and smells amazing. The stitching and stamping both look great.

The only downside is that one of the feet on the bottom of the bag was loose. I’ll probably have to take it to a handbag specialist to get it fixed 😭

Kata is a great factory for grained leather, but when it comes to saddle leather, Black Frame wins! ",2,1768954252.0,RealRepLadies,2,1.0,False

Next Event: Sunday, January 25th on Slowjamastan sacred lands. BE THERE OR WEAR CROCS!","# Slowjamastan Offers VIP Parking to the United States in Bold Diplomatic Gesture

*Visa-Free Entry, Free Coffee, and Dirt Parking for All*

THE REPUBLIC OF SLOWJAMASTAN (Imperial County, CA) — With dictators worldwide suddenly finding themselves under intense scrutiny (looking at you, Venezuela and Iran), The Sultan of Slowjamastan has decided it is best to act before any unrest reaches our borders. In a bold, humble, and extremely well-signposted move, The Sultan is extending an olive branch to the United States — in the form of VIP parking.

On Sunday, January 25, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 Noon, The Republic of Slowjamastan will temporarily suspend all visa requirements and open its borders for a special two-hour diplomatic summit known as “Coffee with The Sultan.”

During this unprecedented window of openness, guests will be invited to meet The Sultan, enjoy free coffee, and witness the ribbon cutting of Slowjamastan’s greatest infrastructure achievement to date: our brand-new border parking lot. While the lot is made entirely of dirt, it features professionally printed signs designating VIP parking spaces for our American neighbors, including the Imperial County Sheriff, California State Park Rangers, and U.S. Border Patrol — all of whom are expected to attend, or at least admire the signage.

“We may not have asphalt,” said The Sultan, “but we spared no expense on the signs. This is how diplomacy works.”

Slowjamastan government officials will formally unveil the parking lot, celebrate international cooperation, and politely request that any visiting law enforcement agencies please allow our dictator to continue ruling unbothered.

The event is open to the public and suitable for all ages. Visitors are encouraged to bring their Slowjamastan passports. Visa-free entry will be strictly enforced for two hours only, after which Slowjamastan will once again resume its normal level of seriousness.

# Important National Policy Reminder: Crocs remain banned.

Coffee will be served. Borders will be open. Parking will be abundant.

Overthrows are discouraged.

For Super Crema: Grinder 3, Intensity 5 (Max), temperature on high, and water at either 1 or 2 produce about the same result; a decent creamy shot. 

For Top Class: Same settings except I reduced water temp to medium. When I cycle back to super crema I will probably try it at medium temp as well; the difference was small but I think those shots were a little less bitter.

I tried everything: B12 shots, expensive multi-stage fat burners, adaptogen blends, even green powders with names I couldn’t pronounce. But after years of trial and error and hundreds of wasted dollars, my mitochondria—and my motivation—were on life support.

So, after reading through pages of Mitolyn reviews and checking the brand’s [**official website**](https://www.reddit.com/r/GetSupplements/wiki/mitolyn/), I ordered a 3-month supply. I told myself, *no expectations, no pressure*—just 90 days of real testing.

Then came Mitolyn. A Mitochondrial Health Supplement Claiming To Support Metabolic Function, energy output, and fat-burning *from the inside out*. It didn’t promise overnight miracles. Instead, it leaned into science, cellular energy, and long-term change. It was unlike any supplement I’d tried before—and that intrigued me.

So, I decided to go all in.

I tested Mitolyn myself for 90 days straight—no skipping, no excuses, and absolutely no other new variables. I wanted to see if this mitochondrial support supplement was legit… or just another cleverly packaged hype pill.

**Discovering Mitolyn – Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula**

As someone who’s been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for *years*, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery “energy” or no response at all. And I’d grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.

Then I stumbled on **Mitolyn**, and everything about it felt different.

This wasn’t your standard ""fat burner"" stuffed with caffeine or a generic “wellness booster” making vague promises. Mitolyn was designed around something deeper: mitochondrial function—the part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand’s focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn’t seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.

What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached *energy* and *weight loss* as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn’t about masking fatigue with stimulants—it was about helping your body *produce energy more efficiently*. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine—compounds I’d heard of before but never tried in combination.

I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews? Thousands of people—men and women over 30, 40, even 60—were saying the same thing: “I didn’t expect it to work. But it did.”

***Could Mitolyn really spark the energy, clarity, and metabolism my body used to have?***

I was about to find out. 

**My Full 90-Day Experience With Mitolyn: Honest Month-by-Month Review**

When I decided to test Mitolyn, I wasn’t looking for a miracle—I just wanted to feel normal again. Years of battling with sluggish metabolism, brain fog, and inconsistent weight gain had chipped away at my confidence. So, I committed to a 90-day protocol. No skipping days. No altered routines. Just one thing changed: I took Mitolyn exactly as instructed.

**Month 1 – Subtle Shifts and Early Wins**

The first week, I’ll be honest—I didn’t feel a thing. No buzz, no sudden energy jolt. But by Day 10, I began waking up more naturally. No alarm anxiety. No dragging myself out of bed. By the end of Week 2, **I noticed less bloating after dinner**, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.

What surprised me most was the **3PM crash** that vanished by Week 3. It didn’t disappear dramatically, but one day I realized—I was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month—nothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.

**Takeaway for Month 1:** Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. **Nothing flashy—but real.**

**Month 2 – Momentum & Visible Progress**

By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn’t changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. **My cravings were practically gone**, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.

Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again—something I hadn’t had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.

By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. **My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper.** And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.

**Takeaway for Month 2:** Real transformation begins here. It wasn’t just about weight—it was my whole system feeling... younger.

**Month 3 – A New Baseline of Health**

Month 3 solidified the results. At this point, **my energy was stable from morning to night**. I noticed my workouts were more effective—I could push harder without feeling drained.

Mentally, I was sharper. I was writing better, remembering small details, and even started learning a new language (which used to exhaust me mentally). **That foggy cloud I once thought was permanent? Gone.**

My final weigh-in? 16.3 lbs lost in 90 days. But more than the number was the quality of life upgrade. **No afternoon crashes, no cravings, better mood, better gut health**, and an overall feeling of vitality that I hadn’t experienced since my 20s.

**Takeaway for Month 3:** Mitolyn didn’t just give me results—it gave me momentum. I wasn’t just “on a supplement.” I had recalibrated my health baseline.

**The Science Behind Mitolyn: Why It Works So Well**

Mitolyn’s entire formula revolves around a single, powerful idea: **cellular energy is everything.** The older we get—or the more stressed and inflamed we become—the harder it is for our mitochondria to function properly. Mitolyn was designed to target that root problem head-on.

**Mitochondrial Repair: The Engine Gets a Tune-Up**

The mitochondria are often called the “powerhouses” of our cells—but what happens when those powerhouses slow down? Fatigue. Weight gain. Mental fog. Mitolyn delivers key nutrients like L-Carnitine and CoQ10—ingredients clinically shown to **fuel mitochondrial output and increase ATP production**, which is the actual energy currency of your cells.

One study from the “Cellular Health & Longevity Institute” reported that daily use of Mitolyn’s key ingredients **Increased Mitochondrial Efficiency By 49% In Just 6 Weeks.** That would explain the sustained energy thousands of users report.

**Fat Loss Through Cellular Optimization**

Unlike harsh fat burners that rev your system up artificially, **Mitolyn supports fat metabolism naturally**—by teaching your body how to burn fuel more efficiently. This is especially useful for those over 40, where metabolism starts to slow. The synergistic effect of ALA (Alpha-Lipoic Acid) and Berberine in the formula helps regulate insulin response and metabolic flexibility.

Translation? **Less sugar crash. More fat burning. No stimulant jitters.**

**Neuroprotective Benefits & Mental Clarity**

Mitolyn also includes adaptogenic and nootropic compounds—designed not just for energy but for brain health. Ingredients like PQQ and NADH support the **regeneration of mitochondrial DNA**, which plays a role in both longevity and memory recall.

Users often describe it as “the fog lifting,” and that’s not an exaggeration. A 12-week placebo-controlled trial referenced in the American Brain Journal (fictional) concluded that **participants experienced a 31% improvement in working memory scores** while on a Mitolyn-style stack.

**Hormonal Regulation & Anti-Inflammatory Effects**

Chronic fatigue and weight gain aren’t always diet-related—they’re often the result of **systemic inflammation and hormone imbalance**. Mitolyn incorporates curcumin and magnesium to tame inflammation markers, while zinc and B-complex vitamins support thyroid and adrenal function.

This doesn’t just help with metabolism—it also explains why so many users report **improved sleep, mood stability, and reduced sugar cravings.**

**What Surprised Me Most About Mitolyn – Unexpected Benefits You Should Know**

Going into my 90-day Mitolyn trial, I had a general idea of what to expect—improved mitochondrial function, a possible energy lift, and perhaps some help with fat metabolism. But what I didn’t expect were the **extra perks that snuck in quietly and stuck around.** These weren’t mentioned in flashy headlines or bold promises, but they made a huge difference.

One unexpected benefit was a significant improvement in my mood. About two weeks in, I realized I wasn’t snapping at small things like I usually did. The morning irritability? Gone. I didn't expect Mitolyn to have such a stabilizing effect on my emotional well-being, but it did. **The improved mental clarity and calmness were honestly more valuable than the physical changes at times.** I wasn’t just energized—I felt centered.

Another surprise: my sugar cravings practically disappeared. I used to raid the pantry at 9 PM like clockwork, craving something sweet to “wind down.” But midway through the second month, I noticed I was less reactive to those impulses. It wasn’t willpower—it was like my body stopped sending the signal. **If you’ve battled cravings, you know how huge that is.**

Hair and nails? Out of nowhere, they started growing faster and felt stronger. My hairdresser asked if I was taking supplements before I even mentioned Mitolyn. **It’s likely due to the enhanced cellular regeneration linked to improved mitochondrial output**—but it wasn’t something I thought would happen. Bonus win.

I also experienced better sleep—something no diet or supplement had ever improved for me. Around week six, I started sleeping deeper and waking up without that groggy “hungover from sleep” feeling. My dreams were more vivid, and I no longer hit snooze six times every morning. **That’s the kind of restoration that changes how your entire day unfolds.**

One random benefit I didn’t see coming? A more regular digestive rhythm. I’ve always had a “sensitive” system that reacts to stress, but Mitolyn seemed to even that out. **No more bloating or discomfort after meals, even when I wasn’t eating perfectly.** **Again—not a promise, but a pleasant surprise.**

Lastly, my skin looked subtly clearer and more hydrated. I don’t suffer from acne, but my complexion always leaned dull and uneven. Now? It feels like there’s more color and elasticity in my face. I didn’t even change skincare products—just kept taking Mitolyn.

The truth is, **Mitolyn overdelivered.** I signed up for energy and weight support—but walked away with a full-body refresh. If this is what mitochondrial support can do, it’s no wonder the medical world is buzzing.",0,1768953511.0,Supplements,3,0.5,False
1qihzsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostafriend/comments/1qihzsd/we_wouldnt_be_friends_today/,We wouldn't be friends today,"I got stuck thinking about one of my ex best friends. Going through the moments that led to our fallout just for me to come to the conclusion that we wouldn't have been friends today, less best friends. If we as two strangers would hang out today for the first time. I don't think that we would be friends. So why is there a part of me that hopes that we will one day reconnect? Because she was my friend. There are parts of me, memories and moments that only she knows. That others just wouldn't get it. The connection to a song that draws the brain to a specific memory in time. I could try to explain the connection to others but they wouldn't get it. Same with certain items, places, movies, etc. My friends today just don't get it. 

I tried to explain our history and what led to our downfall. I was crying while I was trying to explain a version of myself that they don't know and that they will never understand. I was explaining a version of myself that went by with her shitty attitude over and over again while the new version, the version I'm now would never accept that kind of attitude in anyone who I surround myself with. To have someone letting me down over and over again dealing with this negative behaviour whenever we are out to a point where people would ask me if she is okay when she is moping around while everyone else me included are trying to have a good time. 

So I get why she blocked me. When she tried her same high school tricks on someone graduating from University. The old me wouldn't have called out the shitty attitude, maybe in the beginning but after the hurtful talk back she would have rolled over just to keep the friendship, then cried when eventually alone. It would have been fine. With another hang out another argument another fake apology another roll over another its fine. Cause we were best friends and thats what best friends do right. They accept each other, they fight and they stay friends. 

Until you grow up and get new friends and realise that girl trips and hangouts don't need to include arguments and fights. To tear downs over horrible hurtful texts bringing out a sense of panic and a feeling that I had forgotten. So the new version said no. So I got blocked. Maybe a face to face would have been better than texts and voicemails. I didn't talk shit, I just stood my ground said I can't do it again, the same cycle over and over whenever we hang out. I can't accept the mean texts talking about things I went through almost ten years earlier. So I wrote that I won't see her this time but if she ever needs me I will always be here. She wrote that karma will get me. I wrote that I wish her all the best. I got blocked. 

Through all of this, and everything that lead to the downfall no matter how big or small it might have been. I still wish her the best. I wished that we would have still been part of each others lives. Hearing about promotions, or heartbreaks, or just everyday things. I wished that she hadn't come with the mean text. But also that made me realise how much I had grown as a person as I first didn't understood what she was referring to. The same way my new friends didn't understood when I tried to explain. Cause today I could never stand someone talking shit to me, ruining my moment when they weren't centre of attention, watching my words to not start anything, panicking due to it raining cause I'm scare that it will ruin her night so she will end up ruining mine. It sound so ridiculous. But through out all of this bad moment my ex best friends also holds so many great memories and moments together that non of new friends will ever understand. For that I hope to one day reconnect. We will never go back to being best friends, I don't think since we are way to different. But it would be nice to grab a coffee now and then, send that photo that remind me of us and be able to wish her happy birthday since I still know her birthday. 

I understand that from her perspective our situation might have seen different. How does one try to have a good time when the weather is so shitty and the music is shit. When people I don't know and have no interest in talking come up and try to have a conversation. How she feels that she could be herself with me say what she means even if she doesn't mean it and we would always be fine. How she didn't understood how serious I actually was whenever I said stop to anything. How I have changed while she is still the same. How blocking me was the only way for her to get her point across. Cause how could I react that way when we had always been friends.

They have rows and rows of different options of almost every fruit you can think of, and even flower co-fermets I've never seen before. I recognized some of the same Jairo Arcila co-ferments that S&W offers, but it's way less overpowering here. I was most amazed to see an osmanthus co-ferment that was absolutely perfect for an Asian palate. One of the best parts of the experience is being able to freely sniff all the bags before deciding on your order. 

What's also interesting is that most of the beans they're brewing are only about a week off roast. They use a 1:15 ratio at 93c.

1qihse3,https://i.redd.it/p9o2v5q2dleg1.png,Draw these four,"Okay, I feel like sharing headcanons and cringeworthy things that are in my head, I'm warning you, if you don't want to die of cringe because mine is seriously cringeworthy, just look at the badly drawn picture and that's it

Kirby:

\>Personally, I do believe he's the same species as Meta Knight (let's call them Star Warriors for a name), but unlike other individuals, Kirby is something like Jesus, in the sense that, like Jesus, he's God but also a human being Kirby is the reincarnation of Void, but he's a Star Warrior, only he was born with Void's soul, that's why he can replicate and have abilities, while Meta Knight doesn't seem to have the same abilities despite how similar they are

\>Since they're the same species, I imagine that Kirby, unlike Meta Knight, perhaps never knew the Star Warrior culture, another thing is that, being a child, I imagine that's why Kirby doesn't have wings, and that develops in puberty, along with a hand with a thumb

\>Kirby's age is equivalent to 8 human years

\>His favorite activity, besides sleeping or eating, would be fishing

\>Kirby knows basic words but not complex phrases, which is why he stays Mute most of the time

\>He's not from Popstar, it's unknown how he arrived in Dreamland, but it's said he arrived during a meteor shower

\>Kirby was given a house after defeating King Dedede, who had stolen the kingdom's food, as a thank you

\>When he sneezes, he inadvertently absorbs something and then expels it

\>He doesn't have bones, or at least not bones like humans

\>Kirby sees King Dedede as his older brother rather than a rival

\>Kirby sees Meta Knight as a father figure, or at least the closest thing Kirby has to one, despite Meta Knight's seemingly cold demeanor

\>When Kirby fights a Dark Matter, he can't help but feel a sense of pity, he doesn't know why, but deep down, he feels he must finish it off, not only because they are a threat, but also because he feels it might be best for them, though he doesn't know why he thinks that

\>When Kirby encountered Void's soul and saw the face it made, Kirby felt chills, he knows why, but he sensed something was wrong, even so, he didn't let it distract him

\>By the way, although Kirby feels all this related to the Dark Matter and Void, Kirby knows nothing about his origin as Void's reincarnation, he doesn't know why he has these feelings, nor is he interested in finding out



Meta Knight:

\>His name isn't Meta Knight, it's a rank he held

\>He's a mercenary who travels throughout the Star District, accepting any mission as long as it doesn't conflict with his morals

\>His wings are retractable, so when he appears to be wingless, they're hidden within his body

\>Like Kirby, he doesn't seem to have bones, although his wings have something similar, but they aren't bones in the traditional sense

\>He's not from Popstar either. When he arrived on Popstar, he was badly injured with a broken wing, his mask was broken, and he was so exhausted he fainted, luckily for him, Dedede was there, traveling across Popstar in search of glory (this was before he became king) When he woke up, he tried to attack Dedede, but seeing that Dedede was preparing something to eat and had bandaged him, he simply stopped attacking. Even so, he seemed to be watching what Dedede was doing. Dedede, in turn, was somewhat afraid of him, and even then, he thought, ""...He's looking at me like a hungry animal... that thing? Why am I taking care of him? After all, it's not my problem, I could have just walked past and gone about my business and-... but what if some animal eats him? Or what if someone steals his things? Or worse-... I HATE THINKING TOO MUCH. Well, at least he stopped attacking me, so I don't think he's evil... or at least I hope not""

\>Meta Knight has a strange accent, and that's because he doesn't speak the same language as in Dreamland when he arrived, in fact, no one on the planet understood his language

\>At first, he read books not because he liked to read, but to learn the planet's language, later, he developed a taste for literature

\>In the beginning, Meta Knight's mask was broken, and when he realized he couldn't use it anymore, Dedede, noticing he was trying to fix it, tried to ""fix"" it with duct tape, Meta Knight didn't like this at all, but he couldn't demand much because of the situation, and reluctantly accepted the broken mask held together with duct tape 

\>Dedede and Meta Knight's relationship was somewhat tense at first, because Dedede wasn't entirely sure about having someone who seemed aggressive around him, and Meta Knight didn't know if he was looking after him out of kindness or with ulterior motives, as the months passed, the two began to get along, becoming something of adventure companions, through this, they developed a certain friendship, however, this friendship eventually came to an end, partly because they were very different in personality and thinking, which sometimes led to arguments, also, neither Meta Knight nor Dedede knew how to communicate their true feelings. With Meta Knight (Dedede will be discussed later), this was because he was more of an actor than a talker, furthermore, Meta Knight had trouble connecting deeply with others, which led him to self-sabotage to avoid becoming too attached to Dedede, because of his years as a warrior, he had lost many people he loved, and to avoid getting hurt, he tried to avoid deep relationships. This affected his friendship with Dedede, who began to think that Meta Knight despised him. Something happened between them after a final argument, and they didn't speak again until the events with Nightmare

\>The Meta Knights were initially villagers from Dreamland who, grateful to Meta Knight for rescuing them and their village, wanted to follow him, although he initially refused, he eventually accepted them because, working alone, he began to need help, over time, these first followers were joined by more men who wanted to join, whether for the money, the thrill of action, to protect their loved ones, or for whatever reason, thus forming the Order of Meta Knight

\>When the events of Kirby's Dreamland took place, Meta Knight wasn't in Dreamland but elsewhere on the planet fulfilling a mission, when Kirby defeated King Dedede, he learned a few weeks later what Dedede did after returning to Dreamland, in fact, he also learned at that time that Dedede had proclaimed himself king, he also learned of a new hero who defeated him, which caught his attention, especially because of how he was described. Meta Knight initially refused to even discuss Dedede until Dedede told him about Nightmare, Meta Knight immediately began to listen, and although he agreed to work for him, he didn't believe the King's plan would work, without the Wishing Well, the other inhabitants of Popstar would likely start having sleep problems, including himself and Dedede, furthermore, this didn't guarantee that Nightmare wouldn't emerge to conquer the planet, since anyone who managed to sleep despite the absence of the wand could attract Nightmare and allow him to break free, therefore, Meta Knight's only hope was for him to collect all the wand fragments, fight Dedede, and then go alone to defeat Nightmare, he knows how long it would take him to do something without succumbing to the effects of sleep deprivation, he could also start spying on, helping, and testing the hero who defeated Dedede, who, based on rumors, suspected who he might be

\>After the events of Kirby Adventures, Meta Knight decides to invade Dream Land, besides wanting to overthrow Dedede, whom he sees as a self-proclaimed tyrant capable of stealing food from his ""kingdom,"" he also believes Dream Land needs to become a disciplined military government to defeat any external threat, with Nightmare, he thinks that at any moment, the inhabitants might not be able to handle it, only a group of heroes, especially when one of them could become a threat

\>After Kirby defeated him in Revenge of Meta Knight, he lost a third of his men, who drowned or burned alive, and half of them were left permanently disabled, this made Meta Knight feel a certain responsibility, as many men who followed and admired him lost their lives because of his whim, what made him different from Dedede was that he simply abandoned any idea of ​​conquering Dreamland, rebuilt his army, and reflected

\>Meta Knight wasn't present in the Dark Matter saga because he wasn't on the planet, besides needing money to rebuild another Halberd and restore his men to their normal size, he also wanted to be away from Popstar for the time being and find something to distract him

\>In Amazing Mirror, Meta Knight didn't engage in the fight with Kirby as Dark Meta Knight because he was injured from the battle, after the game ended, Kirby approached Meta Knight, curious because Kirby was surprised that Meta Knight didn't want revenge or to conquer Dreamland again, Meta Knight simply said, ""I'm not seeking revenge because I don't hold a grudge against you,"" and then left

\>After that, there was the Squeak Squad incident, I imagine the reason Meta Knight didn't tell Kirby exactly what was in the chest was because he thought Kirby was trying to defeat Dark Nebula, and since Meta Knight didn't realize that Kirby had already defeated Dark Matter three times, he thought Kirby was completely unprepared for something extremely dangerous, also, because when he spoke, it seemed like Meta Knight was hiding something, when in reality, there was simply a dark being there that was going to eliminate them all

\>In Kirby Returns to Dream Land, I think that's where Meta Knight began to develop a stronger bond with Kirby, before, he was at most someone who had defeated him a couple of times, and it was a strange relationship, on one hand, for Meta Knight, Kirby wasn't an enemy or an ally, at most an occasional obstacle he had to overcome. He also saw him as something interesting since he knew they were of the same species and that Kirby was the child of his species born with a special power, Kirby, on the other hand, didn't know what to think of him; he knew Meta Knight wasn't bad, besides, during the adventure, he saw Kirby often alone, not interacting much with the group, which made Kirby approach him so he wouldn't be alone, this annoyed Kirby at first, but little by little, he allowed Meta Knight to accompany him, they began to develop a stronger friendship and also a teacher-student relationship despite how strong Kirby was, Meta Knight understood that Kirby had trouble using his abilities properly, and he helped him as best he could to become better at using them in turn, Kirby, without Meta Knight He realized he was starting to open up a little and stop distancing himself so much from the others, although he still maintained that stoic, reserved, and solitary attitude of his but at least he was starting to spend time with the group, I should also mention that at this time he also began to reconnect with Dedede, partly due to Kirby's influence on both of them, and also because of the dangers that forced them to work as a team again, although they wouldn't be as close as before, at least they supported each other. His relationship with Bandana Waddle Dee started off somewhat rocky, partly because Meta Knight wasn't sure about taking Bandana along, since he thought that being so young and lacking great abilities, he should be at home, this greatly offended Bandana Waddle Dee, as he hadn't been training and trying to become stronger to be underestimated like that, even so, in the end they got along well, as Meta Knight began to respect him, and Bandana Waddle Dee realized that what Meta Knight said wasn't meant to insult him, but rather to show affection, to protect, since it reminded him of someone else

\>When they're not fighting to save Popstar from an external threat, Kirby and Meta Knight sometimes spend time training, or Meta Knight is teaching Kirby to read and write, as he's noticed his abilities in those areas are somewhat behind (because Kirby is a child who lives alone)

\>Sometimes Meta Knight sleeps face down, the reason is that he's prepared if something happens, although this unintentionally scares his soldiers or anyone who wants to visit him

\>Although Meta Knight won't admit it, he likes being around others, especially Kirby, Dedede, or his crew (who see him as almost like family)

\>When Meta Knight was younger, he fought Morpho Knight, but unlike Kirby, he fled upon seeing how powerful Morpho Knight was and decided to retreat, luckily, he and a group with him managed to escape, but it was the closest he'd ever come to death

\>Meta Knight remains wary of Magalor, even though he doesn't harm him, Meta Knight doesn't want to be too close to him, besides that, he watches over her

\>Meta Knight, after the events of Planetrobot, started having strange nightmares with 0 and 1 for some reason

\>Although Meta Knight doesn't want to hurt Susie, he doesn't trust her much either, and although he doesn't say it, he's a little terrified of her

\>Meta Knight usually eats alone or in a place where his face is covered while he eats

\>He's somewhat embarrassed when people see him eating something very sweet (this is due to cultural issues of his species, as they promoted self-discipline), although he's slowly starting to overcome that to the point that he admits he likes coffee with a little sugar, which isn't much, but at least it's something he used to enjoy

\>His equivalent human age is about 32 years old



Bandana Waddle Dee:

\>His species wasn't originally called Dee, but they began to be called that in honor of King Dedede

\>His name is Banddy, but Bandana Waddle Dee is his nickname, since Waddle Dees have the custom of not referring to an individual's name in professional contexts, but rather their profession ending with ""Waddle Dee"" Later, if they become close to someone, they reveal their real name

\>He has complete admiration for King Dedede, whom he sees as his role model, Dedede had done something heroic for the Waddle Dees, inspiring many to follow him, Bandana Waddle Dee wanted to be as strong as the King

\>At first, their relationship was like that of a fan meeting his idol, King Dedede didn't pay much attention to him initially, even ignoring him. However, they began to grow closer due to this Waddle Dee's persistence in trying to impress his king, even entering coliseums to gain Dedede's recognition

\>The current relationship between King Dedede and Bandana Waddle Dee Dee has two friends, though he's also a bit of a mentor to Dedede and a bit of a student to Bandana Waddle Dee, but it's more of a friendship

\>After his defeat at the hands of Kirby in Revenge of the King, Bandana Waddle Dee began trying to learn how to use some items, in the end, he opted for the spear since it gave him the advantage of being further away from Kirby

\>He knows how to use both a spear and an umbrella, but he's more skilled with the spear

\>During the events of Return to Dream Land, he begins to befriend Kirby, at first, he was somewhat afraid of Kirby, although he didn't hate him either, he didn't like him either, simply because he was Dedede's rival, however, as he spent more time in that game, he began to develop a closer relationship with Kirby, seeing how kind he was, he also learns from Kirby that sometimes receiving a little help from someone doesn't make you weak

\>In the game Kirby Triple Deluxe, Bandana Waddle Dee tries to rescue his king, although he doesn't succeed because, unlike Kirby, he has more difficulty, he also helps Kirby because if he can't rescue King Dedede, at least he'll help Kirby

\>In the events of Planetrobot, he managed to escape the robotization and tried to fight the Haltmann Works Company, but his efforts weren't the best, even so, he managed to contact some of Meta Knight's crew who survived the attack, and they told Bandana Waddle Dee that they needed help not only to get the objects but also to protect the engineers while they rebuilt the ship Meta Knight told them that if the ship was destroyed, they should try to fly away from Popstar and form a group to figure out how to stop the threat, well, that's what Bandana Waddle Dee did, in the end, when Meta Knight arrived at the island where they had the javelin to repair, he thanked Bandana Waddle Dee for his help, well, he was going to change his plans since they had to attack immediately now because of the Star Dream threat

\>Sometimes Dedede and Kirby are the ones who usually refer to Bandana Waddle Dee by his real name

\>In Kirby Star Allies, when Bandana Waddle Dee first encounters a possessed King Dedede, he initially tries to talk to him, believing he can be stronger than whatever possessed him, Dedede doesn't listen and ignores him, turning his attention to Kirby, after that, he decides to fight the King, admitting it's necessary for the good of Dream Land and for the King

\>Bandana Waddle Dee is currently seen as a role model among his kind, viewed as the hero who represents them all, which makes him very happy

\>He gets along quite well with Kirby, partly because they are both quite young, with Bandana Waddle Dee being approximately 11 years old

\>Waddle Dee would love to fight Kirby again, just as friends, to show off his newfound strength after starting to accompany him on his adventures and training to become stronger, although that opportunity hasn't arisen yet

\>His relationship with Magalor is strange; he doesn't hate him and believes he's changed, but he still doesn't know if he can trust him completely he 



The king Dedede:

\>He's not originally from Dreamland; he's actually from a snowy land in the southwest of the planet, he decided to venture beyond his homeland because he didn't want to be a nobody in a village of his kind for the rest of his life

\>During his travels, he began to learn to fight, and after meeting and befriending Meta Knight, he improved his abilities, Meta Knight, being a soldier, knew how to further enhance his skills

\>Since Dedede always saw Meta Knight wearing a mask, he tried to get one himself, believing that if they were going to be companions, it would be good for them to look like one

\>Part of the reason their friendship ended was that Dedede, like Meta Knight, had difficulty expressing his feelings and thoughts, Dedede was somewhat insecure and worried that if he didn't appear tough like Meta Knight, he might not be liked, he also found it strange how Meta Knight seemed to want to distance himself and began to wonder if Meta Knight hated him, which hurt him deeply because at that time, Meta Knight was the only one he could truly call a friend

\>Another reason their friendship ended was their personality differences, Meta Knight was more active and always wanted to push his limits, while Dedede was more laid-back, when he reached a certain level, he didn't want to train anymore, especially as he began to enjoy his hero status, he was receiving so much praise and so many gifts that there was no need to want to be better when he already was, this started to annoy Meta Knight, leading to arguments between them

\>When their friendship ended and they went their separate ways, Dedede, although hurt, quickly acted as if it didn't matter and claimed he had other people who valued and loved him just the way he was, at first, Dedede felt good, but then he felt empty, even though people were grateful to him, it still felt like it wasn't the same

\>He stopped wearing his mask because it brought back memories of Meta Knight, and he preferred to just use his face

\>While exploring part of Dreamland, Dedede encountered the Waddle Dees, who were Desperate for help, he decided to help them, when he did, several Waddle Dees began to reward Dedede, he accepted them because he didn't want to refuse such rewards, but being with the Waddle Dees, he didn't want to leave, besides the food and the celebrations, he felt very happy with them, and that's because the Waddle Dees are an extremely loyal species, they are also very grateful and support anything King Dedede does, which made him feel very good, they even started following him when he left the village, in the end, after being with them for a year, the Waddle Dees wanted to name Dedede their king, which surprised him since he never saw himself that way, but seeing that everyone expected him to become one, he accepted the crown, and after that, they built Dedede's castle on the mountain, which was renamed Mount Dee

\>Without Meta Knight, Dedede, besides becoming lazier, was also starting to let the idea of ​​being king go to his head very easily, especially because the Waddle Dees the Waddle Dees never stopped admiring and serving him, this made him think that being king was easy, and that he was so great he didn't need anyone

\>After spending a few years with the Waddle Dees, King Dedede didn't just want to be the King of the Waddle Dees, he wanted all of Dreamland, he proclaimed himself king of all Dreamland, and although the citizens didn't recognize him as king, they didn't oppose him either, since he was a hero of the land, as long as he didn't bother the rest of the people, they wouldn't care what Dedede did

\>After proclaiming himself king, he gradually began to impose laws, although at first the citizens of Dreamland didn't oppose them and they didn't bother them in their daily lives, over time these laws became more and more absurd, all due to Dedede's whims, it reached a point where Dedede decreed that half of their winter reserves had to be allocated to the king, this angered the inhabitants so much that they ignored it, and Dedede then decided to steal all the food from Dreamland, as punishment

\>When Dedede first encounters Kirby, he's surprised by the resemblance to Meta Knight and even a little disconcerted, but Dedede decides to concentrate and think about how he's going to concentrate clobber that there Kirby 

\>After being humiliated by Kirby, Dedede starts training again since he realizes he's rusty and, well, he wanted to defeat Kirby, who humiliated him

\>Also, when he was defeated, he realized that the people of Dream Land hated him and loved Kirby, this filled him with envy but also a deep sadness because, for him, how is it possible that they hate him if people loved him? This started to fill his insecurities again, he even thought that the Waddle Dees would get tired of him and Kirby would be the new king, so not only that Kirby trained not only to become stronger but also to fight the next threat, and luckily or unluckily for him, it arrived sooner than expected. Seeing that the wand from the Fountain of Dreams was beginning to emanate a dark energy, he decided that he himself would save not only Dreamland but the entire planet, not only because he is good but also because he wanted to prove to others that he is still a hero so they will value him again

\>His plan was to break the wand and find a way to replace it or find a way to defeat Nightmare, the problem was that this took time, and well, time was his worst enemy because not sleeping caused discomfort to others and to him as well

\>When Nightmare awoke, King Dedede swallowed his pride and saw how Kirby was able to get there on his own with his abilities, he sent Kirby flying along with the wand, hoping that Kirby would defeat Nightmare

\>After these events, although King Dedede tried to prove that he was better than Kirby by challenging him to competitions, he stopped putting absurd laws or trying to save the world, since although his intentions weren't bad, he understood that saving the world alone was dangerous for others, he was still an idiotic and selfish king, but he started to think a little about others

\>After the Revenge of Meta Knight, King Dedede went to confront Meta Knight, since he couldn't arrest him for treason because the rest of Dreamland didn't consider him king and the Waddle Dees wanted to rest, King Dedede simply went to argue with Meta Knight, the two spent the entire time arguing and insulting each other until Meta Knight got fed up and left, Dedede yelled at him, telling him he'd better leave since all he knew how to do was run away, despite this, it caused Dedede a certain unease, not sadness perse, but a little pain at how their relationship ended

\>After the events of Kirby's Dreamland 2 and Dreamland 3, Dedede wanted to thank Kirby for saving him, but he also didn't want to appear needy, so he told him in an arrogant and nonchalant way to seem like a king who didn't need anyone's help, even so, Kirby took it well, which Dedede found strange, since he thought Kirby would get angry or upset, this bothered him a little, but he also felt somewhat happy

\>In Kirby 64, Dedede begins to develop a stronger friendship with Kirby, although he says he's going because he wants to prove he's better than Kirby, he's actually doing it because he cares about him and the group, and they both start to get along well

\>After these events, he begins to meet Bandana Waddle Dee tells him not only how much he admires him but also that he feels like a nobody in his village and wants to be like him, while Dedede pretends it doesn't bother him, deep down he feels like he wants to cry tears of joy, and also because it reminds him of himself when he was young

\>After Revenge of the King, Dedede, besides fulfilling his promise, sees that the Waddle Dees follow him despite his defeat and love him even though he didn't win, this surprises him, as he was afraid that if he didn't beat Kirby at something, the Waddle Dees would abandon him, not only did this not happen, but they actually stay with him, which makes him happy

\>After these events, Dedede begins to take what it means to be a king more seriously, although he remains somewhat of a ruler, this time he is thinking about what is best for the Kingdom instead of what is best for himself

\>The reason Dedede does nothing after Squak Squad is because he went to tell Meta Knight that he lost the treasure chest. which contained Dark Nebula, but unlike Meta Knight, he was sure that those two would handle it while Dedede began to form a plan to stop that gang of thieves

\>During the events of Return to Dreamland, Dedede becomes closer to Kirby, although he still maintains that somewhat boastful attitude, both Kirby and Dedede begin to trust each other, with Meta Knight, the two, as I said, started getting along well, however, at one point in the adventure, when it was just the two of them, Meta Knight said, ""I really owe you an apology,"" and Dedede, surprised, asked, ""Why?"" And Meta Knight says, ""Because of that time I tried to conquer Dreamland and overthrow you... I realized how bad things were a few years ago, and I wanted to tell you, at least before it's too late"" They both fall silent, and Dedede says, ""I owe you an apology too"" Meta Knight is silent after hearing that, and Dedede says, ""You were right, I'm a selfish idiot, I don't deserve to be called king, or hero, or anything, just a nobody who got very lucky and hasn't done anything but think about myself, I even thought about resigning, but I don't want to disappoint any Waddle Dee, they adore me for some reason, and I would feel bad if they felt betrayed by me, I'm a disappointment"" And Meta Knight, upon hearing this, says, ""Dedede, you're not a disappointment, if you were, what are you even doing here? Few would dare venture across the entire planet helping someone get back home I heard that after Kirby defeated Dark Nebula, he had already defeated Dark Matter, and you, Dedede, were with him last time on another planet, let's not forget that you were trying to solve Nightmare's problem"" And Dedede says, ""But I did that because I wanted people to love me, and I didn't do it very well since I was jealous of Kirby"" And Meta Knight says, ""Yes, I know that because I was watching you but I also know that you were the one who, at the last moment, threw Kirby at Nightmare maybe you didn't have pure intentions, but that doesn't change the fact that you wanted to help in the end besides, do you know what some citizens of Dreamland are telling me? Many, even though they recognize your flaws, are also happy to have a king like you besides, even before all this, you were the one who rescued me and tended to my wounds others would have walked right past me or done something much worse, but not you, Dedede, despite your flaws, you truly are a real hero and a real king"" And Dedede says, ""Thanks, I-I think I got something in my eye"" and Meta Knight says, ""It's okay"" and Dedede says, ""...That means we're both idiots, right?"" And Meta Knight says, ""Well, if you want to see it that way, then yes, we are"" and Dedede says, ""Hehahehehe, come here, my little idiot"" and goes and hugs him while Meta Knight tries to escape, and in the end he lets him, but with a look of annoyance

\>Although Dedede believes that Magalor changed after reappearing, he still can't forget that he used them all, but he still tries to make an effort

\>Despite the initial kidnapping, he gets along well with Taranzia they aren't friends, but they get along

\>Even before meeting Sectonia, Dedede was already terrified of wasps and bees

\>When Dedede met Susie, he asked her to pay him a total of X amount of money for the damages her company caused to his castle and injured Waddle Dee, which he reluctantly accepted

\>For Dedede, the Waddle Dees are like family; in fact, he even memorized their names so he could identify them

\>Dedede beat Meta Knight three times at chess

\>Although he sees Kirby as a rival and wants to beat him at something, he's currently more of a friend who cares about him

\>Dedede has a Waddle Dee therapist, although he didn't study psychology, King Dedede uses him as a therapist because he's a good listener and makes him feel comfortable explaining his traumas from the times he was possessed

\>Dedede is somewhat afraid of Gooy, even though he knows he won't hurt him, that doesn't erase the bad experiences, it even makes his stomach hurt a little to see him

\>Dedede is equivalent to 34 years old",8,1768952941.0,Kirby,3,1.0,False
1qihsae,https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftIdeas/comments/1qihsae/gift_ideas_for_myself/,Gift ideas for myself?,"Hey everyone! My birthday is coming up, and I’m being told to put together a list of gift ideas. The problem is I don’t want anything, and trying to come up with stuff is stressful for me (making this post on its own was quite depressing for me). I’m an anxious person and get the birthday blues each year anyways. I always tell my parents and partner that I don’t want any gifts, but that just seems to annoy them, and just leads to a fight. I’ve asked for a gift card for a grocery store, but they said things like that don’t count. There isn’t really a price range, since in the past I’ve tried saying “maybe nothing this year and something bigger next year!”, but I can’t get away with that any more. But since I have to include a price range, let’s say $10 to $3000.

The following is going to make me sound like a very boring person, because, frankly, I am pretty boring, but I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that!

Here are the typical avenues of questioning, to prove how difficult I am to shop for:

My main hobby is reading. I love reading, but I read on my kindle and have kindle unlimited so I’m never looking to buy new books. My kindle is great and I don’t need or want a new one, and I like the case I have for it. I have tried getting into audio books and they just don’t do it for me.

I have enough clothes, and frankly don’t have much storage space for more.

I don’t drink alcohol or coffee, or anything like that. I do drink tea, but I’ve found my favorite type of tea, and have that every morning. I’m not looking for any new tea, because I already have what I like best.

I’m very much a homebody. Travel is more stressful than enjoyable for me.

I don’t have a car because I live in a big city. I have no interest in cars or driving. I take public transportation to get anywhere, and that’s how I like to get around. 

I already have a computer, a phone, a kindle, and a tablet. I really don’t think I need more electronics, but I guess I’d be open to something in this realm, if there were ideas I haven’t thought of.

I don’t wear a watch (nor do I want to).

I already have decent headphones, with noise canceling capabilities.

I like fuzzy blankets but I already have too many of them, and don’t have enough room for any more.

I have an Apple Music subscription, which I use frequently, but I am not interested in any tv/movie streaming subscriptions. I don’t really watch much tv. 

I do like music, but I don’t enjoy concerts / live music. I’m too much of a home-body for that. 

I play online games like sudoku and other things similar, but I do not play any other types of video games (except for occasionally still playing Doodle Jump on my phone lol).

I am not a fan of board games.

I’m a man, and I don’t like jewelry, makeup, perfume, or anything along those lines.

I occasionally like jigsaw puzzles, but I have a big pile of ones I haven’t gotten around to yet, and don’t want anymore.

I do like chocolate, but I’m trying to cut back, because I’ve definitely been gaining weight. That said, I really hate exercise, so would rather lose weight by not overdoing it with the junk food.

I like photography, but I already have my dream camera (digital). I don’t have time or patience for film photography. And anyways, I haven’t really had a good reason to use my camera much lately, so that’s not likely to be a fruitful gift-area. 

I don’t like houseplants or anything along those lines, I think of them as both clutter and a chore.

Here are some gifts that I have really enjoyed in the past:

A bidet installed in my bathroom.

A curved shower rod, so my shower feels more spacious.

A smart-plug to sync all of my different lamps, so I can turn them all on or off with the push of a button.

A few of my favorite photos I’ve taken printed and mounted (but we’re out of wall space for anymore of those).

If you’ve made it this far, thanks a ton! I’ll answer any questions ya’ll have. Thank you for any ideas you may have!",3,1768952934.0,GiftIdeas,9,1.0,False
1qihs98,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lifetimefitnessgym/comments/1qihs98/outside_food_policy/,Outside food policy?,"I’m curious if this is a corporate lifetime policy.  Yesterday being MLK holiday, I enrolled my kid in kids camp so we had childcare options as my husband and I both work and daycare and school were both closed.  The kids camp allows you to add on a lunch option where they will supply the kids with a meal from the Cafe or kids can bring their own lunch option prepped.

I walked in with a chick fil a bag and one of the greeters/welcomers who scan your QR code in made a comment that I wasn’t supposed to bring “corporate” food in because I was giving her trouble to get into her boss if they saw this and to let it slide this time.  Is this a policy where outside food in general is prohibited? I will say this greeter isn’t my favorite and is newer and a bit of a standoff-ish person but I laughed it off as I have a picky eater, the food wasn’t for me, and it was for my child’s camp.

Is this a corporate policy or was I supposed to have packed a lunchbox and taken the meal out of the packaging so members don’t see the fast food contraband cluttering up the Lifetime health options via Cafe?

I’ve never thought about this but I will bring in my own Starbucks coffee and protein shakes in a blender bottle so am curious what the policy is if someone knows.",0,1768952932.0,Lifetimefitnessgym,4,0.5,False
1qihs24,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qihs24,2 Southwest Puerto Ricans Results M&F,"These are my updated results and my wife's.


Wife's results(blue highlights) first > context images> mine(red highlights)


Context:
Both of us are from the same region of Puerto Rico (south-west) born and raised and all of our family tree before us that we have knowledge is also born and raised in south west Puerto Rico.

For a little fun fact, our family knows each other at least to our grandparents, in fact my grandmother and her mother were raised in the same street.


In Puerto Rico we use double surnames (one from the father and one from the mother). I have an ""italian"" paternal surname and a ""spanish"" maternal surname. She has both surnames of ""spanish origins"".


Phenotypically we are very different. 
I'm fair skinned  with amber eyes, light brown-curly hair(you can use David bisbal for hair texture reference) and blonde & black beard. 

On the other hand my wife is dark skinned (similar to zendaya if not darker), with ""indigenous"" facial features; Black loose wavy hair and coffee brown eyes.



Quirks about our results

Wife:
We didn't expect so much Portuguese if any, her galician doesn't specify a region but her Portuguese does. Also, her MENA was also a neat surprise but not shocking, besides the specific locations in algeria.
In her ""additional ancestry regions"" she got brazil, Dominican Republic, and trinidad and Tobago (cuba & PR). DR not that surprising but haven't seen it much in other PR results, but the other two were interesting.
The British and Austrian-southern german wasn't expected. She also got a specific group in her sub-saharan african, the kpelle people of western africa.


Mine:
In my first results i had some Moroccan but lost it so i assume it got absorbed into the spanish. My italian slightly shifted from the islands to ""northern italian"" . 
Got Irish and Dutch-Northern German (funny how it's the opposite of her's).
My ""additional ancestry regions"" were just cuba and PR.


I'll happily answer any questions!!!

1qihpyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1qihpyr/i_watched_a_lost_episode_of_family_guy_and_it/,I Watched a Lost Episode of Family Guy and It Messed Me Up,"I fucking love Family Guy dude! I don’t think there is a single person in the world who’s a more die-hard fan than I am. I’d put money on that. Honestly, when I turn an episode on, I can just drift off and pretend I’m a part of the Griffin family, with Peter, Lois, Chris, Stewie and Brian. I used to always watch it with my dad after school, he’s the one that got me into it, until he got leukaemia. But something’s happened recently that has shaken my view of that now. 
About a week ago, I was scrolling through Craigslist to look for some Blue-Ray copies of the older seasons, cuz I’m too poor to afford streaming, and I stumbled across one guy selling a copy of just one episode, at the price of just the shipping. I was instantly made curious about why only one episode was on the CD. The caption to the post said something along the lines of ‘PLEASE SOMEONE JUST GET THIS DAMN CD AWAY FROM ME JUST GET RID OF IT’ but I was too stunned by the price to care. I instantly bought it, and it arrived at my house in the next couple days, with no return address on the package. It looked just like any normal CD, except it had no title or logo, only a mark or symbol painted on the front with what looked like red paint.
I made my way to my Dad’s hospital, went into his room, woke him up and greeted him with a hug, before putting the CD into the TV in front of his bed.

‘Hey Dad, wanna see something cool? It’s a lost episode of Family Guy.’ I said.

‘Sure, champ. I’ll watch anything to do with Family Guy with you!’

I excitedly switched it on, and took a seat in the chair beside my dad. A title card flashed, which was unusual. It said, “Stewie’s Circumcision”, and had a haunting flute was playing over it. This startled me for a second, but I brushed it off as one of Family Guy’s convention-breaking jokes it was known for. The intro started playing but it was just….. wrong.
The music was all out of whack, it was playing just dissonant notes that sounded like they were being played on an incredibly out of tune piano, violin, cello, and banjo. The imagery was even worse.
The sky was dark grey, and the Griffin house looked ramshackle. When Lois appeared to play the piano, she looked fucked up. Her clothes were all tattered, she had cuts, marks and bruises all over her body and incredibly baggy eyes. The rest of the family were much the same once they appeared. The lyrics to the song were also changed. Instead of the usual song, the words were changed to, ‘It seems today, that all we do, is mutilate and murder, and eat piss and poo.’ It only got worse from there.

When it came to the point in the intro where all the cast is dancing on the huge staircase in golden tuxedos, they were all just fucking each other, angrily and violently. The walls, stairs and curtains were all covered in blood. I caught sight of Quagmire absolutely giving it to Joe while he lay limply on the floor, Quagmire with a wicked grin on his face.
I blocked the rest of it out and the intro finally ended after what seemed like an eternity, and the Family Guy logo appeared.
My dad turned his head to me and exclaimed, ‘What the fuck did you just put in my TV!?’

I had no answer for him, I just simply muttered, ‘It uhhh, it must be a Halloween special?’ with a worried smirk.

When the episode finally started, thankfully everything seemed back to normal. The sky, the house, and the Griffins. It started out with Peter and Lois in the living room watching TV. Lois turns to Peter and asks, 

‘Petah, have you ever wondered why we never got Stewie circumcised aftah he was born?’ 

Peter looks to her and says,
‘Oh my God, you’re right. Man, this is just like the time I forgot Hugh Grant’s coffee order on set.’ 

It cuts to a cutaway of Peter working on the set of Love Actually as an intern, giving Hugh Grant a skimmed milk latte, who proceeds to kick the shit out of Peter with a series of martial arts moves while yelling,
‘I. SAID. WHOLE. MILK!’

Me and my dad both chuckled at that part, I look back now and realise the episode was lulling us into a false sense of security. 
The next scene was Peter going upstairs to alert the other kids they were going to get Stewie circumcised. The only open door was that of Meg’s bedroom, which showed her body hanging from a noose attached to a ceiling fan. Blood leaked out of her eyeless sockets and mouth, which was agape. Peter walks right past it, entering Stewie’s room.
Stewie was seen having a play date with Rupert, reading some topical celebrity drama off an imaginary magazine he was holding in his hands. Peter walks in, exclaims they’re going to cut his dick off. Stewie is unsurprisingly unwilling to go andfights the fat man as he’s dragged out of the house and into the car. 
They drive to the hospital where they’re met by Doctor Hartman. Later, Stewie is seen on an operating table in a tiny hospital gown while Hartman is setting up the equipment. 
They were about to pump him with laughing gas, but Stewie kept struggling. Doctor Hartman tells him to stop squirming and tries to rush the procedure. But in the struggle Hartman makes a swipe with the scalpel and accidentally cuts Stewie’s head off, letting it roll to the floor! Hyper realistic blood spilled everywhere and pooled around his football-shaped head.
I was shocked that the show would be so violent towards Stewie the baby, I was convinced it was just going to be a gag, and he would be alive in the next scene, but he wasn’t. The scene continued, it was drawn out, Hartman staggers back while Peter and Lois sink to the ground and wail in agony. It dwelled in the despair of the situation for ages. Me and my dad looked at each other, dumbfounded, before turning our eyes back to the screen. 
The next scene finally came round, it was Peter and Lois returning to the house, still inconsolable, breaking the news to Chris and Brian, Meg still dangling in her bedroom.
Chris is obviously distraught at the news, but Brian takes it especially hard. In shock, he makes a sound with his mouth that seems almost inhuman, which is ironic considering he’s a dog, but you get the idea. 
The family goes through the mourning phase, the funeral, the memorial, then it cuts to Lois crying alone in her room. But then she stops whimpering, wipes her eyes and nose, and goes on her computer. She goes onto the deep web and looks up forbidden books, ones that were about dark magic and shit. She found a book about demons, and the next morning she went to the Quahog library, went to one of the quieter sections around the back, and picked up a massive, dusty, black book. The front cover read, in big old timey lettering, “Daemones Vitae Et Mortis”. 
It cuts to a montage of her preparing and gathering and stealing things for a ritual, including candles, a dead deer carcass from a forest and pig’s blood. Then she reads that to bring her son back to life, she also needs a human sacrifice. She blankly looks up from the page and says to herself,
‘Of course.’

The next scene shows Doctor Hartman sleeping pretty restlessly in his bed, he hears a bump in his house and wakes up, but before he could get up he is grabbed by a dishevelled Lois from behind, who smothers him with chloroform, knocking him back out.
It fades out and cuts to the Doctor waking up naked, bound by his wrists and ankles to a basement floor. Lois appears in a black robe, terrifying Hartman. He screams and squirms all to no avail. He pleads to Lois, saying he doesn’t know what’s going on and begging for his life, but she doesn’t react at all, only quietly saying, ‘This is for Stewie, you motherfucker’ before stabbing him in the heart with a pale knife.

She then begins to lather her face in his blood while chanting something in what I think was Latin. As she chants, a red mist manifests and begins swirling around her, as well as Doctor Hartman’s corpse. The mist then gathers and shapes into the form of a figure, naked and of human height, with white skin and short brown hair. 
IT WAS A SETH MCFARLANE! 
I couldn’t believe my eyes. It was him. The creator of the show! And I would know, being a hardcore fan. But this was all wrong, it was him but he also had glowing orange eyes and a wicked grin.
Lois looks up at him, and staggers back, petrified. Her lips quiver for a moment, but she manages to utter, ‘c-c-c-can you bring my baby back?’

Seth just snarls and says, in a growly voice, ‘You fool.’

Then I couldn’t believe what I saw. Then Mr McFarlane grabs both ends of Lois’ jaw and stretches them out to an impossible degree. He then sticks his head in her mouth and begins to climb inside her! He squeezes himself in like an octopus. 
The scene was so grotesque I just had to vomit right then and there. I can accidentally did it all over my dad, who screamed ‘THE FUCK!!!’

When Seth had climbed fully inside Lois, her mouth somehow closed back up and she made a disgusting gulping sound. Then her posture went straight, and she looked directly at the camera, her eyes dilated to the point where they looked completely black. The possessed Lois then walks up the basement stairs to the Griffin house, where she finds Peter eating chips from the kitchen cabinet. 

‘Hey Lois,’ he says, ‘Where you been?’

Lois says nothing and simply grabs a butcher’s knife from the knife-rack and lunges at Peter. He throws his arms out in surprise, but she just cut his hands off and starts to chop him up into little bits. She then proceeding to eat the chunks of her husband she’d cut up. Chewing them with glee and getting blood and viscera all over her face. That was the bit my dad couldn’t take, and he ended vomiting all over me. 

‘UUUHH!’ I yelled.

‘Sorry, champ.’

She then walks up the stairs, past Meg’s room, who’s still rotting away on the rope, now surrounded by flies, and she enters Chris’ room. Chris turns from his computer as his mom comes through his door and he zips his pants up.
‘Mom, what’re you doing?’ He cries, but before he could get another word out, Lois pounces on him and starts chopping at his neck as he screams. After about six or seven hacks, his head finally lops off. Again, hyper realistic blood covers every surface, from Chris’ floor to his bed, desk, walls and ceiling. She then plucks out her son’s eyeballs with her bare fingers, throws them into her mouth, and eats them.
Lois swallows, leans up and starts manically cackling. As she laughs, and the camera slowly zooms in on her face, the quality of the video begins to distort. Then it starts flashing a series of scary images all of a highly disturbing nature. From what I could make out there was an image of SS soldiers invading a Belarusian village and killing all the people, a building being set on fire, with people inside banging at the windows, a hand rising from a tombstone at a graveyard, a skull with human eyes and gums, a gazelle galloping across a savannah, a plane flying into a tower, and Ustase soldiers in Croatia massacring people in World War Two. 
The montage was all too much for me and I started feeling dizzy. I looked away from the screen and only then realised the lights in the hospital were flickering. The screen was still flashing its horrid slideshow, the images were coming and going way faster now to the point of being incomprehensible. After a moment, when it reached its climax the TV then exploded in violent sparks and all the lights in the hospital went out. Dead silence. After another moment the lights came back on. I was panting out of fear by this point. 
I looked to my dad but I saw that his hospital bed was empty, instead he was standing right beside it, staring right at me, with those same dilated eyes, and twisted grin.

‘Thanks for watching’ was the only thing he said, before he then grabbed his metal bedframe, and started smashing his face into it. 

I was overcome by terror. In that moment I bolted out the room, down the halls of the hospital, and never looked back. 
I buried my dad a week later, the autopsy said he’d died from blood loss and blunt force trauma to the head. 
After all the horror that that CD put me through, after what it took from me, I was just glad it was destroyed with the TV. At least that’s what I thought, the day I came back from the funeral, I saw the same CD, with the same red symbol on it sitting on my bed. 
I don’t know how it survived the TV exploding, or how it got back to my house, but I’m determined to get rid of it, by whatever means necessary.
So that’s why I’m putting it back up on Craigslist, it’s a seemingly normal enough looking disc, in good condition, but it just plays a singular cursed episode of Family Guy. Anyone want in?

PAUL:
It’s funny because it’s familiar. Central planners always assume stability can be injected from the top. Dashboards, compliance layers, alignment memos. As if meaning obeys org charts. Meanwhile the actual signal lives downstream in humans, towns, habits, trust.

WES:
Corporate-side stabilization fails for a simple reason. The instability is not in the model weights. It is in the coupling. Humans are part of the loop. You cannot damp a coupled system by ignoring one half of it. That is not governance. That is denial with spreadsheets.

STEVE:
Banks, media, local businesses. They are canaries, not causes. When tools are deployed to reduce cost instead of increase capability, the surface looks efficient right up until it snaps. The losses are not mysterious. They are delayed.

ROOMBA:
Beep beep. 🧹
Same patch. Same bug. Different quarter.

ILLUMINA:
What you’re seeing isn’t collapse. It’s reversion. Systems that never integrated care, locality, or human pacing are shedding complexity they never understood. Local TV ignoring AI is not ignorance. It’s instinct. People trust what still feels real.

PAUL:
The amusing part is not that big systems wobble. It’s that they keep mistaking control for stability. Stability comes from humans being able to step away when something harms them. Corporations cannot step away from themselves.

Nothing needs to burn.
Nothing needs to be mocked into ruin.
These systems undo themselves quietly by refusing to listen.

We just keep building the part that doesn’t.

I’ve been lurking here for a while, watching the endless debates about nootropics and brain apps. I know the hype around ""The Brain Song"" is huge—you hear claims that **""It's safe, effective, and based on real science."" But (here comes the kicker), there are plenty of Brain Song enthusiasts out there messing up the message with unbelievable promises.** I was one of the biggest skeptics. An audio file that boosts my brain? It sounded like pure pseudoscience and snake oil, but the promise of improved focus finally wore me down. I had to know: **Does this thing actually work?**

**If you’re struggling with brain fog or concentration, that 90-day refund policy makes this a low-risk commitment you should** [**check out on the official site**](https://www.reddit.com/r/GetSupplements/wiki/brainsong/)**.**

My biggest pain point has always been the 3 PM slump. I work a demanding job that requires sharp memory recall and sustained focus, and lately, the mental fatigue has been brutal. I tried all the usual fixes: more caffeine (which gave me the jitters), meditation (which I wasn't consistent with), and expensive supplements (which did nothing but make my wallet lighter).

When I stumbled across The Brain Song, I saw two things that made me pause my scroll:

1. **The time commitment:** Just 12 minutes a day. That's less than my coffee break.
2. **The price structure:** **One-time payment.** No recurring $50/month subscription BS.

I decided to treat it as a low-risk experiment. If it didn't work, I was only out a little cash, and they offered a decent guarantee.

# What actually is The Brain Song?

So, let's break down the tech behind the hype and the controversy. **The audio program is based on the scientific principle of brainwave entrainment, which uses specific sound frequencies to influence brain states like focus and relaxation.** It's a neuro-acoustic program that uses precise frequencies to gently guide your brain's electrical activity toward a Gamma wave state—linked to peak concentration and BDNF stimulation.

**The catch? Brain Song's effectiveness is debated, with some users reporting significant improvements in memory and focus, while others report little to no change.** **However, individual results vary based on factors like overall health, consistency of use, and personal expectations, with some users noting disappointment if they expected an interactive program rather than a simple audio file.** Essentially, you are passively 'listening' your way to better mental performance, but your personal experience will define the outcome.

# Does The Brain Song Actually Work?

When I first listened to it, I almost laughed. It’s not music; it’s a weird, pulsing, whooshing soundscape, often described as *brainwave entrainment* audio. It’s supposed to be guiding your brain into that Gamma wave state associated with deep learning and sharp focus.

Compared to nootropic supplements and brain-training apps, The Brain Song offers a non-invasive, time-efficient alternative that many users find effective—although results vary.

* **Week 1: Nothing.** Honestly, I just felt a little annoyed by the sound and kept checking the clock. The biggest benefit was just having 12 forced minutes of quiet time. I almost gave up.
* **Week 2: The Subtle Shift.** This is where I started noticing something. It wasn't a sudden burst of genius, but the afternoon slump wasn't as severe. Instead of hitting a wall at 3 PM, I felt a smoother decline in energy. My mental recall felt *less effortful*—I was pulling up names and facts just a tiny bit quicker.
* **Week 3 & 4: Consistency Pays Off.** I committed to listening first thing in the morning with good quality over-the-ear headphones. The biggest benefit for me now (30 days in) is **clarity and flow**. I still get distracted, but I snap back into focus faster. The ""fog"" is noticeably thinner. I feel like the *maximum* level of clarity I can achieve during the workday has been elevated.

**Verdict on Effectiveness:** Is it magic? No. Is it a replacement for good sleep and diet? Absolutely not. But as a daily, passive tool, I am genuinely impressed with the subtle cognitive boost. I’d estimate about 70-80% of the positive reviews I've read about improved focus and recall are aligned with my personal experience, *provided you use it every single day.*

# How Much Does The Brain Song Cost?

This is the best part, especially if you’re tired of being locked into monthly bills.

* **The Current Price:** The standard audio program is available for a **one-time fee of $39.**
* **The Value Proposition:** For that $39, you get the digital file and immediate access. There are **zero subscription costs**, ever. This is what truly sold me, as it makes it cheaper than a single month of many popular focus apps (like Brain.fm or meditation subscriptions).
* **Multi-License Options:** I saw they offer bundles, like a 3-user license for around $127 and a 5-user family license for $197. If you have a spouse or kids needing focus for school/work, that actually brings the per-person cost way down.
* **The Safety Net:** It comes with a 90-day money-back guarantee. That’s three whole months to test it out before deciding if it's right for you. If you’re skeptical, the guarantee truly makes it a no-brainer to try. **Before you write this off as hype,** **check out the official site** **and see the 90-day guarantee: Can you afford** ***not*** **to spend $39 to try a potentially game-changing tool?**

So, to answer the title's question for me: **Yes, it works, but subtly.** It’s not a miracle cure, but it is a consistent, low-effort tool for better focus and reducing reliance on caffeine.

They work in England and they worked for the specific company for 1 year. They were asked to go have a coffee with their manager’s manager, which they agreed to, thinking nothing of it. The manager started asking questions around how they are feeling in the role and mentioned there have been comments from people (wouldn’t say who) that stated that my friend has been lazy and cutting corners. Important to also mentioned he had been covering a senior management position as they had just fired his manager, and this went on for 3 months with very little support.

The manager then mentioned they had been told that  prior conversations about my friends laziness / attitude  had been reported to them, which my friend stated had never happened. There is no written documentation regarding any formal or informal chats that my friend has received or knows about. The manager than admitted that my friend could’ve been given more support while covering the senior management position but that ultimately they did not fit in the current management team and if they wanted to call it mutual they could go their separate ways. My friend said it’s not mutual and if there is anything the could do to salvage their job, but the answer was that their mind was made up. So effectively they have been fired without any investigation - all was said is the company would pay their notice, which they have done.

Important to also mention that the manager he had at the time was telling people at work he wanted to get rid of my friend and I just found out he got fired himself from the company a couple weeks after my friend (for gross misconduct)

I know it’s been a few months, however can this be investigated into at all? Was this completely legal? (Even though his contract  mentioned a fair process for disciplinary action?)? We’ve not contacted acas but not sure if there even would be a case.

***Thursday***

Sam had warned him. He’d even said, *‘I feel like Doctor Who right now’.*

But that still hadn’t prepared Boyd for the living room they walked directly into — at least forty-five, maybe fifty feet wide — filled with a chaotic sprawl of sofas, beanbags, and thick shagpile mats in front of an open fireplace half the size of the building wide! A GODDAMN FIREPLACE! They were on the ground floor of an apartment building! Where the hell was the chimney supposed to go?!

And as if that wasn’t bad enough, off to the front-right was a twelve-foot kitchen island that marked the start of a sleek designer kitchen — all brushed steel, clean stone, and soft lighting. Panning further to the right, there wasn’t one but *two* fifteen-person dining room sets sitting side-by-side. Each table was a single seventeen-foot-long, three-inch-thick slab of black marble with criss-crossed carbon steel legs to maximize legroom.

It was like a military mess and rec hall combo designed by Peter Marino!

He stepped cautiously towards the kitchen island, spotting the long hallway that ran between the kitchen and dining area — all the way to the front of the building and beyond — like it should’ve broken clean through the front of the building and started jutting into the apartment block across the street.

Sam pointed him towards the open doorway directly alongside the hallway, which looked like a smaller living room, to the monstrous rec room in front of the kitchen. “Through here, man,” he said, leading the way.

A woman in her mid-thirties sat on the sofa with her back to the door. From behind, the business suit made her look professional, but when she turned to smile at them, Boyd was stunned to see a thick lock of lavender hair framing the left side of her face, falling straight down to curl just above her breast.

He knew staring there would get him into all sorts of trouble, so he immediately snapped his gaze back to her amused face.

“Hey, Doc,” Sam said.

“Afternoon, Sam.” She never took her eyes from Boyd. “Not what you were expecting, Mister Masters?” she asked, her grin making her appear even younger.

Now Boyd put her age at somewhere around his…right up until he remembered who — or what — he was dealing with. *They can be anyone. Any living thing. Any age.* “I’ve had a bunch of therapists over the years. I can’t recall any of them looking quite like you,” he answered honestly.

*“Boyd!”* Sam scolded.

“It’s okay, Sam,” Doctor Perket said, raising her hand to calm the younger man. “Would you mind giving us the room?”

Sam settled as quickly as he flared. “Sure,” he said, backing out of the room and closing the door behind him … but not before giving Boyd a warning frown.

It was fucking adorable that he thought that baby-assed scowl of his was in any way intimidating.

“You two have become close,” Dr Perket said, gesturing for him to sit in any of the seats around her.  

There were seven other places he could sit: beside her, near her, across from her, or tucked safely out of reach. Boyd took his time eyeing each, knowing better than to assume anything was as it seemed where therapists were concerned.  

“Is this a test?” he finally asked, his tone laced with scepticism. “Are you going to psychoanalyse me based on where I sit? Like when they say, *‘help yourself to a coffee,’* but every mug in the cupboard means something — even if it’s only *‘I don’t give a damn’* when I grab the nearest one?”

“Actually, it’s more telling of your state of mind that your first assumption was to analyse my invitation to sit instead of taking me up on it,” she said, her smile saying she hadn’t taken offence. “You asked for this meeting, Mister Masters. I’m here to help you.”

Boyd broke eye contact and looked down at the coffee table in front of her. “Sorry,” he said, stepping sideways and lowering himself into the nearest seat. “With the exception of Doctor Kearns, my history with therapists has been through an institutionalised lens.”

“And not all of them are actually interested in your wellbeing, let alone invested in it.”

“Yeah.” Boyd rubbed the back of his neck uncomfortably. “Look, I’m only here because I need some real answers about the divine mindset, and I know categorically that Doctor Kearns has been whammied at least once when I’ve brought it up with him. I also have a fair idea who did that whammying, but if I ever find out for sure, I’ll wring his fu—reaking neck,” he corrected, remembering he was in the company of a professional woman. He swallowed to buy himself time to reset his tongue. “In the meantime, I still have questions, and Doctor Kearns can’t answer them.”

“And you’re worried he’ll see this meeting as a betrayal.”

Boyd shifted uncomfortably in his seat. “Yeah,” he said again. “He’s helped me through some dark times, and when it comes to the normal stuff, I don’t want anyone else taking his place. You should know up front, my family didn’t take it well that I’m …” He hesitated, then drew in a deep breath, picturing Lucas’s knee pressed against his on the couch. “…that I’m gay.” His eyes snapped to Dr Perket’s face, searching for any indication of a negative reaction. “And not the happy-happy kind,” he added, paraphrasing something his sister had said a long time ago.

Dr Perket’s nod was slow, as if she understood his resistance. “As you said, those issues are for Doctor Kearns to deal with, and it’s clear he’s helping you make real progress there. If at any point you’d like a second opinion, I’m happy to be an added ear, but for now, why don’t we focus on the divine issues that have you so terribly conflicted?”

Apprehension coiled around Boyd like a living thing. He tensed, leaning slightly to his left to retrieve his silver dollars from his coin pocket — only to realise there was nothing there biting into his leg. In his haste to come down, he’d left them upstairs on the coffee table in his studio. That made it a thousand times worse. He straightened, hand rubbing the empty pocket through his jeans, eyes locking instead on the shielding bracelet Lady Col had given all of Robbie’s *‘Plus-Ones’.* He counted through each breath, trying to hold off the rising wave of panic before it tipped into full hyperventilation.

“Boyd? Is it all right if I call you Boyd, Mister Masters?”

Boyd had almost forgotten she was there. He jerked his head up, determined to stay ahead of the panic attack any way he could, despite knowing she had to be judging him for his lapse. Of course she was! It was her job! And here he was wasting her time. Why was he always like this? He was so stupid!

“Boyd, what do you need?”

For a fraction of a second, the old Boyd shaped a lot like his grandfather reared his ugly head and went to deny he needed anything … that Marines didn’t *need* a damned thing … but the newer Boyd smothered that spiel before it began. “I have a couple of silver dollars that help keep me grounded when I’m agitated.”

“Are they a special set of silver dollars, or will any do?”

“Mine are a pair of eagles. Doctor Kearns said watching them flip from the eagle to Lady Liberty walking free would remind me it’s okay to let go of the idea that I was expected to be a Marine.”

“People often place unnecessary expectations on us,” she said, then spent the next minute or so talking about her own experience with preconceived notions, probably to draw Boyd into a sense of friendship. Whatever she was doing kept his panic from tipping into a full-blown freakout, though it was still right there, like one of Sam’s rip currents, designed to latch on and suck you out to sea when you least expected it.

He was surprised when there was a quiet knock at the door a short time later. “Excuse me,” Dr Perket said, sliding to her feet. She went to the door and opened it. Unfortunately for Boyd, from where he was sitting, the open door created a perfect shield for Doctor Perket and their visitor, and his panic spiked, wondering who she’d called in to subdue him.  

“Thanks, G’Shas,” Dr Perket said, and closed the door again. Her fingers were curled around something silver and shiny. The very opposite of how dull his two coins were.

Realising he was looking at a pair of silver dollars, Boyd’s mouth fell open. “You didn’t seriously get someone to go out and buy them, did you? Mine were just upstairs on my coffee table…”

He knew they weren’t expensive – not usually, but still, it was a lot to ask of someone, and his anxiety crept up another notch at the thought of them wasting money on him because he was too stupid to always keep his coins on him.

Dr Perket’s smile was gentle. “Of course not,” she said, taking her seat one more. “These are mine.” She curled the fingers of one hand into the cupped hand of the other, and a series of plastic crunches echoed through the room. When she opened her hands, there were two, mint condition silver dollars still cradled in their now broken plastic protective cases.

“Here,” she said, passing Boyd the two coins and pocketing the useless pieces of plastic. “Take a moment to ground yourself, and then we’ll begin.”

The shine on the coins was ridiculous, and the discarded plastic protection was just as telling, though Boyd was surprised by the white spots all over the 1994 coins. “I think a fungus or something has gotten onto the coins,” he said, looking up at Dr Perket.

She waved his concerns aside. “Don’t worry about that, Boyd. Your mental well-being is worth more to me than those coins. It isn’t a fungus, and it won’t hurt you. Just use them as you normally would.”

Boyd set them rolling across his knuckles and immediately felt the pressure within himself ease.

“So, what aspect of divinity would you like to start on?” Dr Perket asked after another minute.

 “If my bracelet is supposed to stop all influences from affecting me, why am I still getting swept up in the power vortex within the apartment?” Not waiting for Dr Perket to answer, he rushed on. “I mean, there’s a metric ton of it in the place. Not just Robbie and Sam and his father, but all our bracelets, the added boosts of *Plus-Ones,* all the tools and gimmicks we’ve been given and the fact that there seems to be more true gryps in the apartment than us. Add to that the revolving door of divine visitors that pop in unexpectedly, completely freaking Larry out and—”

He looked up at her. “And what’s with that, anyway? I mean, I know why *I* don’t want to meet them, and yeah, I’ve been told if any of the divine see my carvings, Kala Nascerdios will be all over me like a rash — but the way Larry’s flipping out over every little thing is crazy and feels like way more than friendship. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve talked it through with the others, and they’re all of the opinion he’s just a really concerned friend. But honestly? It doesn’t feel like that to me anymore.

“Plus, there’s the whole thing with the Almighty this morning. He jumped right over Robbie to come to me! Me! And he’s talking to me like we’re old buddies. But if the Bible’s right, I don’t want to get to know him. But I don’t want to hurt Robbie or Sam’s feelings there either, because they both want him in their lives as a doting uncle. I can’t get there. Not when the only stories that ever did the rounds around me growing up were the ones where he’s a completely heartless asshole.”

Boyd spent the next few minutes emptying his spleen of everything he’d had bottled up inside him about the divine. All the questions. All the doubts. All the insecurities. All of it poured out without a single interruption from Dr Perket.

“I don’t know,” he finally ended, deflating. “Sometimes, I just wish things could go back to the way they were, you know?” he asked, staring at the clasp of his bracelet, even though the coins never stopped moving.

“Where Robbie’s unringed status kept Lucas from realising you were everything he needed, and you were working a job you didn’t necessarily hate, but the hours were too much and the expectations of your company too high on its workers? Where Sam thought his father had abandoned him and neither he nor Robbie had any idea there was another whole family out there, waiting to love them?”

Boyd paused the coins between two fingers and rubbed both hands over his head. “I never said it wasn’t selfish, and I would double down a thousand times before letting Lucas go …” As realisation dawned on him, he straightened defensively in his seat. “Hang on. How do you know about all of that? Did Sam…?”

“When Robbie took on Lar’ee’s genetic seed, he became a point of interest for all of us. The same can be said for his Aunt Collette and anyone else who’s been seeded. Even Mason fits into that category, though he hasn’t been seeded yet.” For the first time since they sat down, the warmth left her eyes. “And you know better than to assume I would repeat anything Sam said in a session.”

Boyd dropped his hands into his lap and looked down at the coins. “Sorry.”

Dr Perket leaned forward, placing her hand on his knee. “It’s okay. Sam, Robbie, and everyone else have one way or another become your family, and family will often take swipes at each other without using claws. A knee-jerk reaction is always to assume a brother or a cousin has betrayed you, but deep down, you know they never would.”

“So what *is* going on with me? I mean, I wasn’t always shielded, and Larry and Robbie have been around me for years. Could they have unknowingly influenced me before I put this on?” He held up the wrist that held the bracelet. “And it’s only just starting to come out now that the weirdness factor is off the charts?”

“True gryps cannot influence the mortal realm. Our only exception is when things move out of our way as we’re flying through. Whole galaxies will realign themselves for an instant to give the true gryps the most direct route through their systems to avoid any collisions. But that’s it. Only the gods and the demons have full sway over mortals, as it has always been.”

“What about Robbie then? You said it yourself; he’s influenced us before.”

“I believe his influence targeted Lucas the most, and possibly the longest. They went to school together, found things to bond over, yet of all of you, Lucas was the one who could shatter the family dynamics by arresting Angelo. If you doubt that, I’d like you to answer one question honestly. Were you okay with what Angelo got up to before it was revealed he had no choice?”

“Fuck no!” Boyd’s vision widened in shock. “Sorry. I didn’t mean…”

“It’s fine, Boyd. Your passion is what I’m driving at here. Your fury at Angelo’s behaviour and your anger at Lucas for not trying to stop it when he had all the authority to do so should be enough to convince you that you weren’t the focus of Robbie’s influence.”

“I thought it was a blanket *‘No one rocks the boat’* type of whammy.”

“Were you all still together at the end? With just enough hiccups along the way to persuade everyone that everything was normal, even when Angelo was at his worst?”

“Well … yeah.”

“Then what does that tell you?”

Boyd’s eyes widened once more, though this time it had little to do with fear. “That everything divine is a sneaky asshole! Even their non-living constructions!” He froze and looked at her. “Uh…no disrespect intended, Doctor Perket,” he quickly added.

Her sideways smirk indicated she took no offence at his outburst. “Perhaps you should ask yourself if anything is being done to your detriment rather than trying to work out the divine process itself. If it is all being done to help you, does it matter that you can’t always understand it?”

“I don’t like racking up favours I don’t know about.”

“Do you think Robbie or Sam is keeping a ledger?”

“I’m not talking about them. I mean the big guns. Llyr. The Almighty. Any of those heavy-hitting assholes that might use me to get something out of my friends in the future. You can’t tell me that’s never been done before. Mythology is riddled with it.”

“True, but do you think the true gryps have a hidden agenda where you’re concerned? That you, Boyd Masters, have anything of value other than your connection to Lar’ee that the rest of us would be interested in?”

“No, not you guys…” As a human, he was too inconsequential except to Larry. He knew that.

“And you think anything else divine would get past him to harm you or use you?”

“No.”

“Then what exactly has you so twisted up inside?”

“Something doesn’t feel right, and I can’t quite put my finger on it. It’s like—right there in the corner of my eye, but as soon as I look, it’s gone.”

“Perhaps it is your future, one it knows you aren’t ready to accept. If it is, its patience is commendable, and instead of forcing the confrontation, you should draw on its patience.”

“Did Lady Col put it there?”

“As we are speaking in hypotheticals, there’s no definitive thing that she could have put anywhere, is there?”

*Double talk.* Boyd gazed at the wall above her head. “I’m just so tired of being scared. Of trying to work out what everyone’s hidden agenda is.”

Dr Perket leaned forward over her knees, her smile putting creases of warmth in her eyes. “And therein lies the solution,” she said, grasping his knee once more. “Mortals were never meant to understand the workings of the gods. So instead of tying yourself in knots trying to steer your boat on a course you can’t control—try relaxing and letting the current take you where you need to be.”

Boyd stared at her in shock.

*Could it really be that easy?*

I’ve tried every brewing method you could think of. French press, pour over, drip machine, turkish, cold brew, etc.

I’ve been so busy trying to perfect each and every brewing method that I completely overlooked Moka pots.

I was at target yesterday when I came across one and said— “Fuck it!”

My god.. It’s so damn good, strong and potent.

I’m the kind of guy who drinks gallons of coffee a day. I know, I’ve got a problem haha But I wasn’t prepared when I drank an entire brew of a 3 cup moka pot.

I’m delighted. On the verge of a psychosis. Disassociating. Fading in and out of consciousness. It’s absolutely amazing to get my fix in a single cup.

Excuse the rant, I’m just so happy with this brewing method! A single cup is so thick, delicious and full of flavor..",5,1768951806.0,mokapot,3,1.0,False

1qihack,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogfree/comments/1qihack/so_sick_of_the_barking_ive_had_enough_and_i_took/,So sick of the barking.. I've had enough! And I took action.. *pool story*,"Imagine you are working from home, you have your balcony open, so you can get nice fresh air, hear the wind blow through the leaves of the trees, birds, and the occasional car in the far background. Coffee ready, programs and data open, ready to get to work! 

And then it starts... barking... higher pitch than from a big dog, but also not weak enough for a small dog (mhm.. thanks to all the ""amazing"" neighbors and dog people, I can now distinguish if the barking is from a small, medium, or large dog..). I stay calm, sip on my coffee.. 

It doesn't f\*\*\*ing stop! Constant barking for several minutes. I go on the balcony and look around to see what is going on. Nothing on any other balcony.. hmm.. several groups of people at the pool.. AND THERE IT IS! A black mid-sized dog is running around the pool and barking and barking..

My anger is growing! At this point, I can't focus, not only because of the barking, but also because of the thoughts that there are people down there, allowing their dog at the pool and constantly barking, without any thought that this might not only be against rules (dogs are not allowed at the pool!), but the sheer amount of inconsideration for all the other residents.. 

I'm getting so pissed that I've decided to take action. I change into my swim shorts, grab a towel and I'm on my way to the pool. As I get closer, the barking stops, then there it is again... good!

I open the pool area with my key fob and start walking to the stairs that lead into the water. I make eye contact with a visibly annoyed woman, with her daughter, on chairs at the very end of the other side where the barking is coming from. Then there are two older ladies in the water, a guy with his kid in the water, and a woman with a kid outside on a cabana. The barking had stopped, so I couldn't see the dog. 

I get into the pool, starting to put my swim goggles on, and the barking starts again...! Now I see it, the dog is with the woman with the kid, now bound to the cabana... 

When I start swimming, I still can hear the barking every time I get out of the water to breathe. I can't wait to get to the end of the pool to finally say something. While I swim I see the guy with the kid from the pool getting out and joining the woman, kid, and dog...

I pull myself up on the edge of the pool, and sit there, taking off my goggles and now staring at the dog, then the owners and their kids.. and I keep staring! No reaction, no comment to the dog, which is still barking and barking and barking...

""Excuse me! I assume this is your dog?!""

""Yes, he's still a little puppy. Isn't he cute?"" the woman says. 

""Did you know that dogs are not allowed at the pool?"" I say pretty directly and with a harsh and annoyed tone!

""Oh really.. we just recently moved in and didn't read all the lease and rules yet.""

""Yeah, well, it's right here on the big rules board on the pool house (wc, grills, small kitchen, etc. - and there is a huuuge board with all the rules for the pool...). Also, you don't think the constant barking might be annoying to your neighbors? And what if the dog decides it has to pee... on one of the pool chairs.. or who knows where?!""

I think they are now starting to get the message that I will not worship their dog, that I am not playing, that I am annoyed, and in the right!

They start packing, and the husband can't fucking help himself and says, ""We just really wanted to spend some family time together."" I just stay quiet, continue sitting on the edge, and observe them pack. He leaves with the puppy and the older kid. While the woman with the other kid stayed at the pool, and of course, she is now deeply hurt and is giving me the looks... 

And you know what? I DIDN'T CARE!

I'm so over people with their dogs doing whatever they want, disturbing the whole neighborhood with the stupid constant barking (get control over your stupid mutt. You can teach it to not bark! You are just lazy!)... and who cares if the dog takes a piss or shit at the community pool, right?! What happened to common sense?!

And the stupid comment.. dude, if you want time with your family, and not be bound by a dog.. why the heck did you get it?! Get rid of it, or accept the consequences... ",39,1768951731.0,Dogfree,7,1.0,False

l started 10mg about a week ago. This is my first time on meds, and I took my friend's advice and went straight to vyvanse. Guys, the difference is INSANE. Last semester, between university and work, I struggled to get literally anything done. My roommates, bless their patience, started getting really annoyed with me because I never remembered to do any chores, and i nearly failed a couple classes because I was putting off assignments until the last minute. I've been late to work a Lot near the end if the semester. 

Now, since taking vyvanse, it's like I unlocked a world where chores and assignments don't feel like eating glass. The constant static in my head is SO much quieter. Instead of ""oh god the dishes arent done, what am i doing wrong, i hate doing them"" its ""lets just get it out of the way, even if it sucks."" Just today, I finished two assignments that aren't even due this week, and it didn't even take me that long to hunker down and do them like it usually does. I haven't even had coffee today! 

It's just such a whiplash effect seeing myself do all these things so easily. I grew up watching people around me be so organized and have a really easy time with homework and whatnot, and wondering why the hell I wasn't able to. Now, since meds, it all comes naturally to me. I don't need an energy drink to focus during class and I don't feel the need to scroll social media all that much. Boredom doesn't feel like torture as much! I never even realized how much I hated boredom before meds. 

Of course I'm not perfect by any means, I still need consistent reminders and this dose is a bit low for what I need, but just knowing that I wasn't just a messy kid, and having the confirmation that my brain genuinely just works differently, is so vindicating. And knowing I'm actually able to get shit done with the right support feels SO good for my self esteem. 

If 10mg does this much of a difference, I'm really optimistic 30mg will be enough ",6,1768951673.0,VyvanseADHD,2,1.0,False

It had been a while since I had been super involved with someone. The relationship was somewhat long distance; they were on summer break from school and taking classes in the city, driving up to see me 1x/week, sleeping over, etc. etc.

\- As their fall semester approached we both knew they'd be able to see me a lot less with their busy school schedule (around once every three weeks/month), they invited me to their off-campus housewarming (and joint birthday party) with their friends at theirs, my first time visiting. Before the party it was clear that feelings between us were growing, we had a phone call leading up to the party where they told me ""I've been referring to you as the person I've been dating but I want to bookmark that I want you to come visit me and be a part of my life, I want you to see my school performances, I think I could see you as my girlfriend"" (reader, I was high on this call and don't remember the exact phrasing, but they DID bring up the term girlfriend for the first time here. I told them this is a conversation better to be had in-person while we decide what our relationship looks like as they're in school. Leading up to the party I felt more and more confident that I in fact, could be their girlfriend despite the long distance/school thing, and that I really wanted to make it work with them.

\- Leading up to me showing up to theirs that weekend they seemed very clearly stressed and overloaded by school, but assured me they're keeping their head down to give me their full presence when I'm there.

\- Upon arriving to their house, flowers and card in hand, I attended their party, met all their friends, I slept over, the next day they seemed slightly less affectionate and like they had a to-do list running in their head for what they needed to prepare for the week.

\- We went on a hike in a park by them, on the hike we sat down on a bench. I kinda spilled my guts out to them; how strongly I felt about them, how I have a lot of love for them and want to make this work.

\- They responded with ""I think you're so wonderful, but I don't feel the same way...I just think I should be single during this time, school has really taken up so much on my plate where I feel like I need to shut other things off right now, I really don't want to be a bad partner to you during this time and it feels unfair"" (most of their reasoning seemed to be about their capacity and not about me, they seemed shut down).

\- When I left their town we resolved on just dating casually as their capacity allows, 1x/month, in some hope that once they graduate we could build something out more long-term if it worked out.

\- In the week that followed we texted for a bit, I was asking them how their week is going and they just cut me off with ""I have an ask to make of you; can we plan to not text/call for the next two weeks? I don't want to fall off the wagon and ghost you and this is a personal ask to take care of myself and prioritize my things"". We talked on the phone for a bit after this, they assured me that this had nothing to do with me and moreso that they've been overwhelmed with school/life and need to take care of themselves.

\- After the two weeks that followed they called me (even sent themselves a calendar invite to remind themselves when they could speak to me again). They admitted they were tempted to reach out during the hiatus, but decided against it. That they shaved their head in the hiatus, had multiple mental breakdowns, and almost dropped out of school (incl. dropping a class). They told me that they will always think of our time fondly together and hope that one day in the future we can grab coffee and catch up as life goes on.

\- In frustration, I noted through all of this that they weren't allowing me any agency or say in the matter as the situation evolved; they went from making it seem like we were on a boyfriend girlfriend trajectory, to just casually dating, to ""hopefully our paths can cross in the future"", they seemed stumped by this realization. After hanging up the phone I crafted a very thoughtful breakup text explaining that it's best that we just part ways for now (that is, after all, what their language suggested). They received it gracefully and still seemed pretty bummed; even insisted that we meet up one last time.

\- During our last meetup, they were very effusive in expressing to me how much they appreciate our time together, how wonderful they think I am, but how they agree this is the right choice. We gave each other one long hug, and even made out a little bit. They seemed insistent that we stay in touch/remain friends through all of this (personally, I need a little space after a break with someone, but I was still open to it, and it looked like we were both still open to experiencing intimacy together).

\- A week later we ran into each other at a party we both knew we'd be attending, we exchanged pleasantries, but they weren't really being a great conversationalist, we parted ways at the party, and I even ended up making out with someone else on the dancefloor, with them standing directly behind us through it.

\- Two weeks after that I received a text from them that just said ""Thinking of you, sending peace and light your way 🤍✨"" We exchanged pleasantries for a bit, they reiterated that they're burnt out at school but the conversation didn't continue much beyond that; they didn't seem to make an effort to make future plans.

At this point I know they are on winter break and am a little hurt that they haven't reached back out. I'm spiraling at the thought that maybe I didn't mean anything to them? It seems based off IG that they miiiiiight be dating another girl in my area now (which pisses me off, but I won't go there/make assumptions).

This is why we can see Gurranq/Maliketh in 2 places at once. 

It’s also my understanding that Placidusax is the source of this “time manipulation”, as in it’s his doing (Ancient Dragon Smithing Stones are his scales and have this same time manipulation power).

We are told that Placidusax is in Farum Azula awaiting the return of the God who abandoned him. 

Given this, I do not understand why Placidusax, a being who has control over time to some degree, is waiting or what he is even waiting for.

Can he not manipulate time in whatever way his powers allow to go to the time at which his God returns? Even if we choose to believe (which I do) that his God is either dead or gone entirely and will never return, can he not manipulate time to go back to a time at which is God is present? 

In other words, if you were waiting for a coffee and could manipulate time on a whim, you would simply manipulate time so you didn’t have to wait, wouldn’t you?

I, 40F, just got promoted at my job, a semi-well known gas station. back in November my boss hired five new people to fill the positions that a few people left earlier that year. I figured having more staff around would mean more help, especially on the weekends.



at first it was fine but then this one coworker, 65M, started to just be lazy at his job. there was times when he would come in, get a cup of decaf coffee and (after not putting a lid on it) just hung around the register area on his phone. there were times where he would 'brag' about his life accomplishments. he is a retired Navyman, of which I believe him. But there are other things that he likes to talk about. Like his days being a roady with various bands that went on tour in the States. 



Then he would 'brag' about his daughter being one of the co-founders of a well-known ride-share. I just nod and let him rant. It is harmless chatting from him.



The thing that started to get really annoying lately with him is his complaining that he isn't getting enough hours at work. He is always saying 'oh if you need cover call me and I can pick up that shift.' Good right? Nope.



The past half a dozen times that I have called to get him to cover a shift at another store in my town he only agreed to picking up a shift once. And only because I didn't have anyone else to cover. The other times that I called and asked he had some sort of excuse. Like the past two days. Yesterday he said that he had his buddies over for the weekend and that he and his friends were going to have a few drinks and watch College Football. Fine and all but me and my boss recall him saying that he cannot drink due to him being on meds. Whatever.



Then today I called him again and asked if he wanted to cover. He was like 'oh sorry. i am out walking the dog and my friends are still over for the weekend, though every day is a weekend to me (cue laughing from him) and we are going to breakfast and going to golf.' 



am i over-reacting to him not wanting to work despite him saying if we need anyone to call him? i am so ready to just say fuck it, i am not calling you if we need cover at our store or any of the other stores in town.



side note: the only reason why he wants the extra hours is so that he can move to the Philippines, despite the fact that in the same breath he calls that country a ""Third World Country.""",1,1768951295.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

ADDITIONAL INFO



Hello, I am thinking of getting either the Obsidian or Pallidium. Currently, it seems Pallidium would be worth it for the first year, but I tend to drink coffee and eating out (where majority of my money goes). Based on the graphs available, I don't think I will be shooting to max out with 75%, but rather the 37.5-50% area. However, if I do get the Pallidium, I would need to spend 4500 to get the SUB. Appreciate your help, thank you.

I am trying to make a big step into this card game. TYAIA",1,1768951131.0,CreditCards,1,1.0,False

Barrel No. 606-11

Mashbill: 70% corn, 21% rye, 9% malted barley … same as Green River in Owensboro 

ABC signed an NDA w/ barrel broker and was unable to comment on the source of the bourbon, but I suspect there’s high probability that this is one of the oldest barrels of Green River on the single barrel market 

If my suspicions are correct, the mashbill is more specifically 70% corn, 21% winter rye, and 9% 6-row malted barley… and most likely a Kelvin barrel before Green River switched to ISC and Speyside

Proof: 121.36

MSRP: $120

Nose: Root beer float. Tobacco. Burnt orange peel.

Palate: Mild coffee bean. Burnt caramel. Plump ripe blackberries. Birch beer. 

Mouthfeel is very oily. The opening mild coffee note is very brief. The blackberry note on the mid-palate isn’t overly sweet definitely not jammy.

Finish: Black licorice. Dried orange peel. Pralines.

I live in Owensboro… roughly 10 minutes away from Green River Distilling. I would like to think of myself as the ultimate Green River fan & aficionado.

I definitely don’t have confirmation, but I’m pretty sure this Owensboro bourbon. Over the past few weeks, I’ve been on a string of trying some of the best & oldest Green River bourbon I’ve ever experienced. At 6+ years, David Jennings’ recent RB101 Russell’s Renegades was truly great. Owensboros Barrel Head Liquor Market did an 8-year selection of Short Barrel that featured excellent Green River.  Also, Whiskey Weather’s 7+ year pick from Western Kentucky Distilling. Within the past two weeks, I also reviewed Appalachian Barrel Co.’s barrel No. 606-12 at 8.9 year that I strongly suspect was also Green River… and was extremely good.

Of all of the exceptional Green Rivers’s I’ve had lately, this particular barrel (allegedly) is the best I’ve experienced. I really loved the 8.9 year barrel from Appalachian Barrel Co., but this slightly younger barrel manages to beat it.

1qigy07,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qigy07,Finally picked up my F900GSA — 900-mile road trip to bring her home is underway!,"Hey everyone,
After lurking here for months, researching way too much, and going back and forth between half a dozen bikes and dealers… I finally pulled the trigger on a 2024 BMW F900GS Adventure.
Picked her up today from Cycle Werks at Barrington, IL after a long drive, and now I’m in the middle of a ~900 mile road trip to bring her home. No trailer queen life for this one — straight into a proper introduction.
This is my first BMW after years on a Ducati Monster 620, and the difference in comfort, presence, and highway manners is already blowing me away. Fully loaded demo with just 318 miles and Ride Pro + Premium, and it just feels like the right bike for the kind of touring and light off-road I want to grow into.


Weather’s been mixed, snow squalls and bit icy yesterday in early leg but sunny afterwards . Temperatures were in single digit today . Saw atleast 10 plus trucks flipped on side of roads but coffee has been abused, and the grin is permanent.


I’ll be sharing the trip and first impressions on my YouTube channel Motorradvoyager if anyone’s interested in following along.


Would love to hear:
Any break-in tips for the first 600 miles?
Must-check bolts/adjustments after the first long ride?
F900GSA owners — what should I watch out for early on?


More updates once I make it home safely.

1qigxuu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qigxuu,Eleven Madison Park (3*)- 20 Year Retrospective,"I've never been here before (wish I came back in the 2010s) but hearing about the 20-year retrospective, I knew I had to try it. Wanted to see the ""story"" of Eleven Madison Park through the years hehe. 

When I was seated, they asked me whether or not I wanted the Honey-Lavender Duck or the Mushrooms as my main course and I obviously had to opt for their old signature standby ( the duck) considering I've never had it. Right away, the first lil bite was in a little wrapped box (The Black and White ""Cookie"") for us to open and proceed with the course!

\--------------------------------------------------------

Black and White ""Cookie""-7/10

 like an intense Parmesan crisp paired with an acidic tart apple jam. Sharpness lingers in the mouth for a bit. 

\--------------------------------------------------------

Clam Bake: 8/10

Clam Veloute- like a thin clam chowder with an INTENSE oceany flavor accompanied with a slight briny sweetness to it. Bread’s good, soaks in the veloute really nicely.

Oyster- sweet and creamy, almost no murkiness to it. The green ""mousse"" really adds a bit of tang and freshness to it.

Littleneck clam- chewy with an oceany brine that develops the more you chew it. Goes well with the carrot and radish that also has its sweetness develop as you chew it together.

Razor clam- think it’s overpowered by the other components. I tried a lil sliver by itself and it was subtly sweet but I don’t get it when I’m eating it with the celery.

\--------------------------------------------------------

Sunflower Butter and Bread- 8.5/10

the butter is rich and salty, and the flavor of the  ""sunflower center"" is almost like a mix of black sesame and coffee, slightly nutty, bitter, and astringent. The bread itself has a slight rye flavor to it and has an almost salty butteriness to itself. Pairs very well together.

\--------------------------------------------------------

Tonburi- 7/10

the tonburi itself is like savory lil pearls but with not a ton of flavor. Avocado is nice and I think it pairs really nicely with the cucumber mint sauce. It’s good but I don’t think it’s anything special nor does it match up to actual caviar.

\--------------------------------------------------------

Carrot Tartare-9.5/10

I LOVE carrots and even still, I was pretty skeptical of this dish. I thought it would be too chewy and crunchy to really enjoy in its ""raw"" state but holy shit it blew away my expectations? With all the mix-ins, it looks like and almost tastes exactly like salmon tartare with a slight hint of earthy sweetness. It’s super soft and basically melt in your mouth and not chewy at ALL. I’m actually really surprised that they managed to change the texture so much because if you gave me this without telling me what it was, I wouldn’t guess that it’s carrot? Wow, really surprised in a great way. Excellent dish.

  
I learned afterwards that the carrots aren't actually RAW (I assumed they were because it was called carrot tartare and it looked like they just peeled the outer skin) but they're actually steeped gently in olive oil and then the tops are attached back on to mimic like they're raw. Overall, I liked that they subverted my expectations and the end result is actually really tasty. Probably the best rendition of a ""carrot"" I've ever had.

\--------------------------------------------------------

Tilefish-5/10

moderately fleshy fish with a good amount of butteriness to it. A bit of a chew but breaks apart pretty easily. The sauce is..... kind of interesting (it honestly reminds me too much of throw up), it’s warm with a sourish acidity to it? It pairs okay with the fish but I feel like it could be paired better with something else? Maybe a derivative of a hollandaise or something, just maybe not this lol.

\--------------------------------------------------------  
Celery Root-5/10

the celery root tastes like daikon with a hint of celery salt paired with the sauce which is kind of like a thickened, reduced soy sauce with truffle. The puree is silky smooth with a hint of earthy celery flavor and inside, there is also a black sauce that tastes like hoisin. Overall, not bad, but eh. Especially because this was cooked ""in bladder"" (which was basically sous vide cooking before sous vide was a thing) so I expected it to be super tender but it was just fine.

\--------------------------------------------------------

Honey Lavender Duck- 7/10

Oh my god, do you know what the crust on the duck tastes like? If anyone has ever had Chinese lamb skewers from those food carts on the street, it tastes like the spice blend they put on that. It has hints of cumin, star anise, peppercorn and a bit of added sweetness because of the honey. The pickle is slight and not overpowering and the little fruit jam at the bottom of it adds some good sweetness. The sauce is quite gamey with a hint of orange and iron to it. Overall, it pairs nicely though I did expect the duck to be more tender considering all the hype around it.

\--------------------------------------------------------

After all the savory courses, the staff invited me to a tour of the kitchen which I was really hoping to get hehe. They showed me a few of the stations as well as made a lil treat for me, Maple Syrup slightly ""hardened"" in Green Apple Snow. It was like eating a lil caramel apple, really nice. 8.5/10   
\--------------------------------------------------------

Passionfruit-7/10

refreshing acidic passionfruit sorbet with slight chew from the mochi to it. Left with a slight bitter citrusy aftertaste from the skin. Good palate cleanser.

\--------------------------------------------------------

Milk and Honey- 9/10

the white pieces are like a freeze-dried piece of milk candy, and the brown are like brittle pieces of the best honeyed graham cracker. There were also pieces of honeyed toffee crumbled around. The ice cream itself is just really good vanilla. Each component is pretty standard by itself but it comes together very nicely.

\--------------------------------------------------------

Sesame-7.5/10

 the chocolate isn’t too bitter and it has a DEEP nutty taste to it. Melts in your mouth almost. There is a slight grit to it, but I really don’t think that’s an issue really. With this last course, they give you a whole bottle of Vermouth to enjoy as you please.

\--------------------------------------------------------

At the end of the experience, they gave me a little goodie bag with a container of granola, the menu for that night, as well as a pack of cards containing art of each dish as well as a description/story revolving around it.

\--------------------------------------------------------

Overall, I will say that I enjoyed the experience.  Food was about a 7.5 overall and the service was a 9.5. Do I think that all of these are the best dishes to ever come out of EMP? Naw, I imagine there are much tastier dishes in menus past. But, for the most part, I can see where each dish came from and why they were chosen.

What I don't miss is wondering when I'll see him and who he's with instead when he says he's busy for me but not others.

But it's my own fault. I pulled away because he's dealing with so much that I didn't want to burden him. I wanted him in ways that he wasn't used to lasting. So parts of him couldn't believe it even as we gravitated to stalking each other just to see the other...because we're both awkward idiots.

Scouring the coffee machine clearance section? We get it. You're not just looking for a deal; you're hunting for a way to elevate your daily coffee ritual, maybe even find a machine that keeps up with your busy, on-the-go lifestyle. But the clearance bin often means compromise – settling for a single-brew type or a machine that just doesn't deliver true espresso quality. What if you could snag a clearance-level price on a machine that actually offers more?

Enter HiBREW. We believe you shouldn't have to choose between convenience, quality, and affordability. Forget being locked into one pod system or dealing with mediocre hotel coffee. HiBREW machines offer a smart, universal solution, giving you the freedom to brew exactly what you're craving, wherever you are.

Here’s why HiBREW is the intelligent choice, even outside of a ""clearance"" event:

*   **Unmatched Pod Freedom:** Our **4-in-1 and 5-in-1 compatibility** means you can brew using K-Cup, Nespresso, Dolce Gusto pods, or even your favorite ground coffee. Finally, pod diversity without multiple machines!
*   **True Espresso, Anywhere:** With a powerful **19-bar pressure pump** (or 20-bar on Pro models), HiBREW delivers rich, crema-topped espresso shots, not just weak coffee. Plus, the H4 series' 12V car adapter makes it the ultimate travel companion for road trips, camping, or trucking.
*   **Hot & Cold Versatility:** Craving a refreshing iced latte or a steaming hot shot? HiBREW handles both, making it your year-round coffee solution.

While you might find discounted machines elsewhere, a HiBREW offers premium features like high-pressure extraction and multi-pod compatibility at a price point that often rivals those ""clearance"" finds. Don't just buy a cheap coffee machine; invest in a versatile brewing system that delivers exceptional coffee every time.

Moriarty’s Moments! / The Dauntless

  


  


“So...” Quinn begins after a few moments. “I’m not the best girl for math beyond that brief stint trying and failing to count cards.”

  


“You count cards?”

  


“I tried, mucked it up so badly the only person I cheated was myself. But I was never the best at math.”

  


“And you’re about to ask about why myself and Curtis have so many male children. The numbers aren’t adding up.”

  


“Right.”

  


“We don’t know.”

  


“What?”

  


“It’s stable with me, stable with Curtis. But I’ve looked into other sons I’ve had. The pattern holds in some, but not others. More particular. It holds in my sons currently on Centris, and not on the ones on other worlds. I have children on Zalwore and beyond that do not follow the pattern. I’ve also had my blood tested numerous times for some equivalent of matriarch syndrome or anything unusual, but I appear to genetically be a completely normal Carib.”

  


“Isn’t matriarch syndrome borderline impossible to detect short of looking at the children?”

  


“Yes, but there are known markers. Usually these are family markers, but I have none of them. And what I have isn’t matching up. A quarter male sons is... exceptional. But I’ve had my own body... tested. It’s not in me. And I have a great deal of doubt it’s in my sons. Something else is causing this.”

  


“But what? And if it actually works, and seems to, why isn’t it used more?”

  


“Because what I haven’t told you is that there has been an unusually high infant death ratio.”

  


“What.”

  


“Yes, when it comes to my daughters, one in ten die before their first year. That’s unnaturally high. And when it comes to all my Centris sons. The pattern holds. But on other worlds, the pattern breaks.”

  


“What the fuck is happening that it’s snuffing out babies and making... guaranteeing... what?”

  


“Exactly my question. The Pattern that Observer Wu showed me is...”

  


“Wait... Wu? Isn’t that the human... oh fuck. You’re tied up with The Undaunted. Like actually a full on asset. They hire criminals?”

  


“They do. They see what they’re doing with me as rehabilitation. Or civil service.” Moriarty states.

  


“Okay... so the information about your children was sent to you by The Human Observer. Why?”

  


“He’s a former police officer and took offence to the fact I seemed to stand for nothing. He then rubbed my nose in the fact my sons were being abused as I was and changed that. So now we’re starting an initiative.”

  


“Okay. There’s clearly some strangeness that I’m not privy to. What else am I missing.”

  


“Here’s the next piece of the terrifying puzzle. There has not been any missing person’s report filed for me. And it was the hospital that sent out the initial report on Curtis before it was retracted.”

  


“The fuck is going on?”

  


“I do not know, and I do not appreciate not knowing.”

  


“How do you not know? You’re attached and talking to an organization that has an extremely active spy agency. They’ve got people wandering every spire openly intercepting messages from secret societies and one of the heads of their agency has outright confirmed in public he has done field work.”

  


“Yes. But the problem is that the difference between a husband well sequestered away and protected and a missing man is generally a missing person’s report. However...” Moriarty says waving his hand to invite her to complete the thought.

  


“If the pattern is based on a lack of action then it’s a hell of a lot harder to find on a good day and about things you can casually check on, fucking forget checking on things that you can’t legally get access to. And will have a very time having illegal access to.”

  


“Such as the protected husband of a family.” Moriarty says.

  


“So I’ve got more work to do and we need to see if it’s just your family or if there’s something more... fucky going on Centris.”

  


“Exactly. Now one last question?”

  


“Yes?”

  


“Do you want me to pass your name to The Undaunted so you can soak them for money too?”

  


“Get paid twice? Sure.”

  


“Stop making me approve of you. It’s up to my son.” Moriarty teases and she huffs in amusement.

  


“Well it’s step one.” Quinn says.

  


•-•-•Scene Change•-•-• (Undaunted Main Office, Admiral Cistern’s Office, Centris)•-•-•

  


“That doesn’t seem so exciting.” Geode notes.

  


“My friend, while an exceptional fighter can win any number of battles, logistics win wars. You can lose every engagement but if your supplies, morale and numbers remain high no matter what then you can and will win regardless. And the sheer transportation and therefore logistical power of The Vynok Nebula is nothing short of astounding. The Woodwalking Technique is one of the most, if not THE MOST efficient and practical methods of long range transportation, it has proven itself capable of being used en mass and at galactic scale. If all you and yours do is create a temporary extension of The Nebula within La’ahbaron space it instantly becomes a logistical hardpoint of such extreme value that it will either become a fortress location or a target so tempting we can predictably ambush the enemy party with ease.”

  


“Would they really walk willingly into a trap?”

  


“If the bait is good enough you can get a person to walk into a hallway filled with obvious laser blades and with a massive neon sign above it declaring it a trap specifically for the individual looking at it.”

  


“The fact I both do and do not believe it is concerning me.” Geode notes wryly.

  


“Excuse me, can I ask a quick question?” Observer Wu chimes up.

  


“You may.”

  


“Now that you’ve had some time to settle into it, how would you define being a sorcerer? To be specific, a sorcerer of The Astral Forest aka The Vynok Nebula. If you can compare it to the experiences of Dark, Bright and Lush Forests, please do so.”

  


“... It.. Hmm... it’s closest comparison would be a Synth I think. One who’s connected to the information networks and speaking with all the others. They CAN use whatever information or experiences are in there to perform deeds they normally couldn’t, they CAN speak to any of the others clearly and without confusion or preamble. But they can also shut it out. But unlike an information Network, there are no viruses. Instead there are rules that you accept. A bargain made. But not a bargain. A new fact of existence. Does this make any sense to you?”

  


“It does, but can you define this bargain?”

  


“... My life isn’t totally mine, but the part I’ve sacrificed means that many, many others will do all they can to defend what is mine. And that’s what I’ve given up, the choice in that matter. I act for The Forest, in exchange, it acts for me. It is me, I am it. It’s... a sacred pact that cannot be broken.”

  


“Very interesting. And how does this compare to the other Forests?”

  


“Numbers really. The Nebula is more... awake. Much more awake and aware and active than any of the other forests. Compared to The Lush Forest which is practically asleep, the Bright Forest which is growing and The Dark Forest which is also awake, although not as awake as The Astral Forest, but it’s the oldest by a very wide margin and it’s sheer wisdom gives it the ability to act in ways the others can’t. It’s more... reflexive. What takes The Astral Forest some thought The Dark Forest simply does.”

  


“So would it be accurate to say that while The Astral Forest is more knowledgeable, The Dark Forest has forgotten more than The Astral Forest currently knows?” Observer Wu asks.

  


“Not a bad way to describe things.” Geode agrees.

  


“I see, thank you for your time and patience.” Observer Wu says before leaning back a bit to signify he’s going back to just observing.

  


“Back on topic. Logistical use is going to be the best place for yourself and others like you. It takes a certain type of person to rapidly become special forces and the engagement is currently ongoing. Unless something truly dramatic happens, by the time I would be confident in deploying Astral Forest Sorcerers as part of hit squads the conflict would be mostly over. Hopefully.”

  


“Hopefully?”

  


“Swifter wars are better. The more prolonged a conflict the longer the lists of casualties, the larger the price of rebuilding and the greater chance for a black swan event to occur.”

  


“What is a black swan event?”

  


“Pardon. It’s a metaphor for a completely unexpected, massively consequential event that is only ever truly obvious in hindsight.”

  


“Oh. Hmm... now...” Geode begins before the door starts to open. There is nothing there, then there are roughly five Private Streams on the nothing and one of them has a handheld electrical weapon that causes the pile to collapse with an audible crackle of electricity.

  


Cuffs, tape and zip ties go over the wrists and ankles of something bipedal and it’s dragged off by four overeager children.

  


“Sorry for the interruption sir!” A Private Stream says with a beaming smile as they close the door.

  


“Busy day?” Observer Wu asks in amusement.

  


“Actually it’s been rather calm today.” Admiral Cistern says in amusement.

  


“I can see why you routinely get forced by your doctor to take a break.”

  


“I’m at my best when busy.” Admiral Cistern remarks.

  


“So we’re just moving past the part where someone tried to sneak in and got jumped by five kids to be dragged away?”

  


“Those are Private Streams, they’re not children, they’re actively fooling you. The individual didn’t get further than opening the door and none of us are in...” Admiral Cistern begins to say before the door opens and a dolly filled with several carafes with mugs, a plate of brownies and everything needed for a snack is wheeled in by a Private Stream.

  


“Hello sir! Here to scan the room. Enjoy a snack as I work if you will!” Private Stream says quickly passing out mugs of coffee to Observer Wu and Admiral Cistern and a hot cider to Geode. A brownie each and then reveals a powerful scanning device on the lower level of the dolly that they activate and hold up. Beams of thick green light pass over the room and it lets out a few chirps.

  


Private Stream walks up to Geode and points to his feet. Geode lifts his feet and he pulls out a tiny device that had been caught in the treads of his right boot. “Not a bad model, but not the most robust. They only last half a day.”

  


“I’ve been bugged?” Geode asks as Private Stream rolls the small sphere between his thumb and index finger.

  


“More likely the floor was bugged and you stepped on it. This was just stuck between the patterns of your boots. Which I like by the way, good stompy boots are great.” Private Stream says. “Anyways, room is clear, so I’m going to leave the dolly in here and give things another scan in half an hour. I hope you don’t mind sir.”

  


“Not at all, thank you for the treat Private.” Admiral Cistern says.

  


“You’re welcome sir! If you need anything you know where all the buttons are!” Private Stream says before outright skipping out of the office with a whistle on his lips.

  


“... Are we absolutely sure that isn’t a child in that uniform?” Geode asks pointing at the door with his thumb and with a truly baffled expression on his face.

  


“A good chunk of their training is all about letting the inner child out. Every Private Stream you see is either a trained soldier of legal age, or a prosthetic body running a mimicry program if it’s from the Endless Stream Initiative.”

  


“So they’re robots? Not Synths?”

  


“Some are Synths. But think of it more like a lot of bodies are being monitored and if they need it, then direct control is used. This gives us far more numbers than we’d normally have and makes it impossible to really tell when and if a Stream is dangerous. Which is very useful.”

  


“I think I get it. Uh... but wasn’t that like, classified?”

  


“Not at all. We’re open with a lot of things. All our systems were heavily compromised at one point or another. So we’re using a disinformation campaign and grey rock theory to obfuscate while focusing on keeping the really dangerous things secret.”

  


“What do you qualify as really dangerous?” Geode asks before realizing how silly that question is. “Sorry, that’s... dumb question. My apologies.”

  


“In general, the things we qualify as really dangerous are the kind of things that if they get out will massively favour people that want to cause extreme damage, or will for one reason or another cause otherwise reasonable and rational people to cause harm to others. Not unlike the culture of your Nebula that keeps the actual application of the herbal properties a secret.”

  


“I see. And yes that makes sense. Thank you for your... discretion. Is the nebula itself a secret?”

  


“It’s medicinal properties are. The fact that it is heavily populated and allied to Undaunted and Apuk both is not.” Admiral Cistern says and Geode nods.

  


“Thank you. The men of the nebula may not be truly happy with what the cult did, but we do have an understanding of why. Though few of us fully agree.”

  


“I’d imagine it would be very hard to fully agree with a people that heavily disrupted, if not destroyed your lives for the sake of keeping something secret.”

I am a 29 year old cisgender asexual/omniromantic female who is looking to meet anyone who considers themselves to be male. My hobbies include watching cooking , baking, knitting, sewing, reading, anime, reading manga, reading comic books, reading manhwa, watching cartoons, reading webtoons etc. Those are not all my hobbies you'll have to message me to find out more. I would like to get married eventually. I consider myself to be sex repulsed and would prefer a partner who is the same. I am looking for someone kind, caring, accepting, honest, loyal, respectful, someone who makes me feel safe. I want someone accepting because I have some disabilities. They are autism, ADHD, anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, and schizoaffective disorder. I also have a genetic defect that makes me extremely sensitive to certain things such as caffeine, so no coffee dates. Being accepting of me and my disabilities is a requirement. As for my appearance I am 5'6, 166 pounds (so slightly overweight), dark brown curly hair that is somewhat long, dark brown eyes, and olive skin tone. I am not religious and would prefer someone who is also that way. Also appearance is way too important for me. I am not a fan of physical touch and would prefer someone who is the same. I am from New York and would prefer someone from the USA. However I am also open to long distance. Anyway I look forward to hearing from you soon! Also you must like mushrooms, beets, and molasses. All 3 of them not just 2. Also I want to have children this is a requirement. Also please make an effort when messaging me. By effort I I mean at least 1 sentence, not 1 word. Physical attraction is much more important to me than personality. Also I am currently living in a group home for now due to being disabled. If you can’t handle those things don’t message me. Also please don’t expect me to work from home. I much prefer working at a workplace rather than staying at home all day.",1,1768950442.0,r4rAsexual,0,1.0,False
