1moczls,https://stilessupply.com/blogs/news/portland-gear-cascade-backpack,The Portland Gear Cascade Backpack: Your All-Around Wonder-Bag,"Why the Portland Gear Cascade Backpack Is the Perfect All-Around Pack for Urban Commuters to Students

Let’s be real, finding the perfect backpack feels like hunting for Bigfoot outside of a beef jerky commercial. You want something tough enough to survive the urban jungle, smart enough to keep your stuff organized, and cool enough to make you feel like you didn’t just grab your little brother's Paw Patrol bag. Enter the Portland Gear Cascade Backpack: your new everyday sidekick that ticks all those boxes and then some. Actually, that bigfoot analogy looks pretty good now that we’re traveling to the Pacific Northwest for this backpack.

 

Weatherproof exterior: Rain or shine, no drama

Weather (nailed it) you’re sprinting to class through a surprise drizzle or dodging coffee spills on your commute, the Cascade’s weatherproof TPU-coated fabric has your back. No soggy laptops, no soaked notebooks, no “I should’ve brought an umbrella” regrets. Just dry gear and peace of mind. You may regret the umbrella, but at least that sales pitch won’t be damp.

The exterior also wipes clean with ease. No harsh chemicals or scrubbing, just wipe it and go. So find the color that suits your mood and get going. Oh, and in case you were wondering, there at 15 of those colors to choose from.

 

Wireframe opening: Stand it, pack it, love it

Here’s a feature that’s a total game-changer: the Cascade’s wireframe opening lets the backpack stand upright on its own. That means no more awkward balancing acts while you dig around for your headphones or lunch. It’s like having a mini luggage stand wherever you go, packing and unpacking just got a whole lot easier.

 

Thoughtful organization that keeps up with you

Inside, you get smart compartments designed to keep everything where it belongs:

✅Padded laptop sleeve (fits most 15-inch laptops)

✅Quick-access front pocket for your phone, keys, and wallet

✅Mesh water bottle holder (because hydration is life)

✅The aforementioned bottle holder is laser-perforated so the sleeves won’t collect water

✅Hidden valuables pocket for that little extra security

✅“Easy-see” grey lining making it, you guessed it, easier to see your stuff inside the bag

✅Luggage sleeve to easily slip over the handle of your favorite carry-on (which you can also find with us)
 

Comfort that lasts from dawn till dusk

Long days demand a backpack that feels like it’s not even there. The Cascade delivers with padded shoulder straps and a breathable back panel. Even if you’re hauling textbooks, snacks, and your gym clothes, it’s designed to keep you comfy on every step of your daily grind. There’s even a chest strap to better distribute the weight if you’re an over-packer. We’re luggage people here, we know a thing or two about over-packing. There’s no shame, this is a safe space.

 

Sleek style meets practical design

No need to sacrifice style for function. The Cascade’s clean lines and minimalist vibe make it the perfect companion whether you’re heading to campus, a coffee shop, or just around town. Like I mentioned earlier there are 15 colors to choose from. From neutrals to bold to calm and serene, there’s something for you. You may not know there’s also a second size! The standard size is a 21L capacity bag, perfect for school, work, and travel. The compact is a 13.5L mini-me version. Only, it’s far more practical than those mini designer backpacks that fit your cell phone and a pack of gum. So, join the thousands that love their Cascade backpack and find out why Portland Gear really created what just might be the perfect backpack

 

DETAILS & SPECS (Standard 21L)

✅Dimensions: 18” H x 12” W x 6” D

✅Weight: 2.2 lbs

✅Weatherproof polyester exterior

✅Wireframe opening for upright packing

✅Padded laptop compartment

✅Multiple organizational pockets

✅Breathable mesh back panel and padded straps

If you’re tired of backpacks that either look good but fall apart or are tough but clunky, the Portland Gear Cascade Backpack strikes that perfect balance. Ready for whatever your day throws at you, rain or shine, class or commute. Get it now before that next surprise downpour.",1,1755015117.0,StilesSupplyCo,0,1.0,False

Next week I will arrive to your lovely city,  however I have some logistics that I would like to clear up before arrival.

I will arrive by Flixbus on thursday, and it seems It will be at 5:00 am. Unfortunately,  my hotel checkin is at 16:00

How do you recommend to spend those hours? I will have my backpack and a small carry on. Is it ok to stay at the bus station until 6 or 7 am and get a coffee until the sunrise ? Is the area safe to wonder around in the early morning.
Any coffee shops you recommend to grab breakfast at to pass time?
Also. If there is a possibility to store my luggage at the train station. I understand I have to walk from the bus station to the train station anyway.

Any recommendations are greatly appreciated

I noticed that there was bus stop on the north bound side of the road (2201 Airport/Manor stop) near the detailing shop. As I walk towards the stop, starting at Theo Dr., there is no sidewalk because they are building a new strip center on that block! They put a few orange cones along the edge of the street where it appears you are supposed to walk, but it felt so dangerous because you are literally walking inches from huge 18 wheeler trucks going up Airport Blvd. 

When there is a break in traffic, I briskly walking up to the bus stop only to discover the bus stop is closed. I risked my life for nothing! Then I notice I can go to another stop a few hundred feet away that is on Manor Rd, next to the CVS. I walk over there and a bus pulls up. It will take me to the east side of Mueller, good deal. When I try to tap my phone to pay... SORRY there is no Tap To Pay! The bus driver tells me you have to download the CapMetro app, then you have to load money on the App before you can pay for the ride. Geez! Thank God the bus driver was super nice let me on the bus. I was only going 5 minute up the road, so he cool with letting me ride for free. 

I have lived in Austin for more than 15 years, and I rarely have to take mass transit. I am pretty sure the last time I was on a MetroRapid bus I could just tap to pay. When I was recently in New York City, London and even Miami, they had Tap To Pay to ride their mass transit systems. Austin, nick-named ""Silicon Hills"" because of the fast growing high-tech industry, is sooooo behind when it comes to mass transit technology.  ",0,1755015048.0,Austin,2,0.5,False

I started hitting the gym hard two years ago, I’ve stuck to it and couldn’t be more proud. I don’t do cardio at moment, I strength train and lift heavy 3-4 days a week. The gym part I’m happy with, my husband does bodybuilding and he sets our workouts. I see changes in inches and shape. First year I barely dieted and just focused on getting healthier in gym. In Feb this year I started a calorie deficit, I’m down 30 pounds since, 210 pounds 5’6, and prob 40 pounds overall in 2 years. I have pcos and my initial attempt at cutting last year to 1700 calories did nothing. In Feb I began doing 1200-1400 calories with cheat day on weekend. It was slow but I was ok with it as I’m also trying to build muscle. My goal is only 180-190 as I’d like to powerlift at some point for a competition. For almost a month now though my weight isn’t moving at all and sometimes even up. I track my calories in an app and measure everything. My days are usually 
Fast in the morning with just a protein bar, lunch is 3 eggs with two slices of grain toast and sometimes I do a slice of ham or turkey bacon for extra protein. I’ll generally have a coffee or energy drink on gym days, no more than 100 calories on it. If I snack I do strawberries and sugar free jello. Dinner is 6 ounces of chicken and about 120 calories in potatoes. I add vegis in throughout as well but not as much as I prob should. This is it. Thats all day and generally 1200 calories unless I do a chomps meat stick or something small. Occasionally dinner is swapped for a turkey sandwhich or chicken lettuce wraps. This has been since feb, my lifts suck at this point because I’m not really getting enough in but if I add more food I gain. And between work and lifting and calorie deficit I think cardio would actually take me out. I’m generally lifting 2-3 hours in the gym each session. My stomach is relatively flat, I have some chubby and even poking through, but I cannot drop any more weight. This is basically since highschool I cannot get under 200 pounds. I’ve been tested and my hormones are garbage, always. I don’t ovulate, my estrogen and test are low always but my doctor says unless I want to have a baby they won’t help. Any advice I’d happily take truly. 😩",1,1755014588.0,loseit,0,1.0,False
1mocqk3,https://www.reddit.com/r/IVF/comments/1mocqk3/after_retrieval_and_ohss_no_period/,After retrieval and OHSS... no period,"Dear group, I posted in here a while ago when I got OHSS after my 1st (and only) retrieval in March this year, it was exactly 5 months ago. 

  
I had like 20 eggs and 19 were frozen. I responded really well to the Bemfola, so the downside to so many eggs was that I got OHSS. I was painfully swollen in my belly for around 10 days. I stayed home and rested and cried a lot. My weight went up like 10 pounds.

  
So fast forward to this summer, I started to feel more like myself but still low energy and a bit depressed, like my body was still tired for a long time after. I also started to get worried that my period was not coming. I do not have a partner at the moment so no chance of pregnancy. I've had hypothalamic amenorrhea in the past a couple of times but that was when I was vegan, running all the time, and very thin. I am at a BMI of 20-21 now, I eat around 2500 calories a day to support my hormones and healing my body from the trauma of the retrieval. But still nothing, until..

The past few days I decided to stop drinking so much coffee, for many years now I've had more than 3 cups a day, so now just 1 a day and started eating more fruit. I noticed a huge shift in my energy levels (higher) and mood, my creative and sexual energy also became suddenly ignited, and I gained 3-4 pounds within 2-3 days, bloated and feeling like something is finally happening down there. I really hope it's period coming soon, because the bloating is really uncomfortable, I don't want to leave my house, and it reminds me of OHSS all over again, just a more mild version of it :'(

  
Has anyone else experienced this after retrieval and possibly OHSS? How delayed can our periods be after such an intervention?

One of these days—after you've battled through the impeachment drama, the Senate whispers, the media circus—you’ll open this and think: “Eh ‘to ang tatay ko talaga.” I write from The Hague, where they say justice lives—but here, justice sips cheap coffee, acts serious, and forgets how to laugh.

Let me set the scene: March 11, 2025—I walk into a plane, and bam! They arrest me under ICC orders, call it “Operation Pursuit.” Suddenly, I’m flown halfway around the world, and they think that cuffs and a suit will shut me up. I laughed. “Give me durian, not these crackers!” I joked, but nobody laughed. Weaklings.

Still—news came: despite the orange jumpsuit, despite The Hague, I was re‑elected mayor of Davao by a landslide—eight times more votes than the closest rival, over 660,000 souls shouting “Duterte!” From a cell! That’s not power—that’s dynasty. ** **.

And you, my daughter—Vice President Sara—facing impeachment. They tried to drag you down, but the Supreme Court tossed it out July 25, saying it was unconstitutional and blocking any trial until 2026. You dodged it. You emerged stronger. ** **

Now, see how this works: while they try to destroy us, we just rebound. Baste steps in as acting mayor, Paolo holds Congress, and grandkids fill local posts. The Davao machine is humming. ** **.

So here it is—Tatay’s extended manifesto:


---

1. Never let them write your story.
If they want to impeach you—flip it. Make it “they’re removing a threat.” You already proved that. They can’t stop what’s rooted.

2. Don’t just lead—intimidate.
Politics is not a kindness contest. If they cross you, cross them back—with style. One-sided roasts, mixed with fear—that’s power.

3. Laugh last, roar early.
Swear at them in public, then wink on TV. Let them think they’re laughing with you. Then, when the court calls or the Senate glares—you’re already two steps ahead.

4. Dynasty isn’t a dirty word.
If they call us “oligarchs,” let’s own it. The more they hate, the more they expose they’re afraid. Build your allies; bloodline is a foundation, not an affront.

5. Sleep is tactical.
Rest when your mind says fight—it saves strength for the real battles. Remember: anger spends energy, sarcasm keeps ammo in reserve.

6. Make those ICC suits sweat with style.
They think they can humiliate Duterte with formality. Show them consequences have class—and claws.


---

Inday, I miss Davao: the chaos of jeepneys, the smell of durian hitting your nose at 2AM, people yelling “Duterte!” everywhere. Tell Baste he’s doing fine holding the fort behind bars. He’s mayor now—but don’t let him take the throne. You’re still the power behind the throne.

When you come here—if you ever do—bring durian. And let’s terrorize these judges with smell of home. Remind them this is Filipino flavor. This is Duterte.

You carry my name, yes—but more than that, you carry my instinct: fight, outwit, win. And maybe roast them so badly they’ll beg for mercy.

Love,
Your Papa Digong

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a clash of Brazilian flair and Colombian resilience as Fluminense-RJ hosts América de Cali in a Copa Sudamericana thriller. The odds are in, the stakes are high, and one team’s defense is about to face a reality check. Let’s break this down with the precision of a goalkeeper saving a penalty… and the humor of a forward who’s misplaced his cleats.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)

The betting markets favor **América de Cali** at **+2.15** (implied probability: **46.5%**), while **Fluminense-RJ** is the underdog at **+4.20** (23.8%). The draw sits at **+2.75** (37%), suggesting bookmakers expect a tight contest but lean toward the Colombians. The spread? América is a -0.25 favorite, meaning they’re expected to barely escape with a win or a draw. Meanwhile, the total goalsline is locked at **1.5**, with even odds for over/under—translation: brace yourselves for a defensive masterclass or a sudden flood of penalties.

Statistically, América’s edge makes sense. They’ve won 60% of their Copa matches this year, while Fluminense’s win rate plummets to 35%, largely due to a defense that’s been more porous than a sieve in a monsoon. But let’s not forget: numbers are just ink on a page. Sometimes, a team’s star striker is out because he tripped over his own shoelaces.

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Circus Acts, and Suspended Midfielders

**América de Cali**: Their star striker, **Camilo Sanvezzo**, is sidelined with a hamstring injury he picked up during a pre-game warmup… while attempting to juggle a ball and a coffee cup. Without him, their attack resembles a chef without a recipe: ambitious but directionless. Worse, their center-back, **Diego Hernán Escalante**, has been suspe

1mociyv,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeschoolRecovery/comments/1mociyv/im_constantly_shocked_by_events_that_most_people/,I’m constantly shocked by events that most people learned about in school or from their parents.,"Growing up, I don’t recall my family watching the news or reading the newspaper much. We didn’t have cable. My parents never really talked about much beyond the people in our corner of the world, which was very church-centered. I had a decent childhood but now struggle with understanding the world around me due to lack of education. 

I didn’t really notice how much I didn’t know until I got moved out of their house. I was homeschooled (and I use that word so loosely because my parents weren’t really qualified or actively participating in our education) until 11th grade. They joined a church that encouraged home schooling so I guess that how we ended up in it. I don’t think they were ever super gung-ho about it. I barely graduated from public high school. It’s all a blur to me. So moving out and getting a non-religious job was my first big exposure to soooo many world events I never knew of that are still insanely relevant in understanding todays world (the Cold War, colonialism, US history, etc.). It feels like my friends and coworkers have a trove of background knowledge that they can just casually draw connections with and understand things while I constantly have to spend hours reading up on on Google. 

Even more shocking are the major events from my own lifetime that I don’t have a personal memory of or just don’t know much about even though my peers vividly remember them. Hurricane Katrina, Obama’s election, Bin Laden, Fukushima, and Sandy Hook are just a few things I’ve recently been blown away by the depth and historical importance of. I had no idea the OKC bombing even happened, let alone why it happened. I learned of it at a coffee shop open mic when the performer said “blowing up like Oklahoma”. I asked my friend “why is Oklahoma blowing up? Why did she say that?” I was so shocked. My mom is from Oklahoma. We went there often to see family. and yet she never mentioned to us it was bombed by terrorists. 

I’ve noticed that if I or their friends don’t mention major news to them my parents wont even know it’s happened until much later, usually at church, if at all. And then once they’ve learned about, they rarely do any further investigation. My dad says the news is all bad and designed to keep you scared so he doesn’t care for it. He said that he can tell I’ve become more worried since I moved out. Maybe so, but I think it’s a disservice to not be aware. For example, a tornado struck a few miles from their house a few years ago. They didn’t know until days later when they drove by the damage recovery effort on their way to the store. 

I think it’s good to take breaks from media and not be consumed with information all the time. I also don’t expect everyone to know about all the details of everything that’s ever happened. And perhaps in some way I got to experience the innocence of childhood longer than most people. But I’m writing this to say this: I feel my parents did us a big disservice by being checked out from current events AND not being active stewards of our education. Terrible combo. I don’t understand how they have gotten to a place where they can just go through life without knowing what’s going on. And I’m kinda angry that they sent us into the world at a disadvantage. Has anyone else struggled with feeling left behind/out of the loop for similar reasons? How did you make up for your lack of basic knowledge? What other major events/ historical areas should I study?",5,1755014091.0,HomeschoolRecovery,0,1.0,False

I’ve been following this Reddit for a while in search for an espresso machine for my new house, where I’ll finally have a bit of spare space on the counter. I’ve been using the Bialetti Moka for a couple of years, previously with the Wilfa Svart and recently with the Wilfa Uniform Plus grinder. At home I usually drink whatever comes out of my Moka - straight or over ice. My husband mainly mixes the Moka brew with cold milk over some ice cubes. I always use fresh, locally roasted speciality beans. We have a big budget to spend and after reading so much I have even considered Linea Micra paired with Mazzer Philos, but tbh I think that would be an overkill. So I wanted to start with something more basic, like Sage Bambino Plus paired with my Wilfa for now or Barista Pro and using the Wilfa for the Moccamaster that’s sitting in the box due to lack of counter space (gifted recently by my loving brother). I am happy to develop my very basic barista skills (used to work at a chain coffee shop in London, old days!) and play with the equipment, up my milk frothing game. However our setup must be rather straightforward and easy for my husband who’s not really looking for a new hobby… and I don’t want to always be the one making all the coffee in our house. Therefore I thought that maybe Barista Pro would be a good option for both of us. We will be making 4-5 shots a day, around half of it as lattes (hot or cold). I’m happy to consider other options if you have any suggestions. As I said, we’re ready to spend more money (especially on the grinder) but I believe that working our way up slowly will make us appreciate all the later upgrades more and really see the difference. :)",1,1755014064.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Copa Sudamericana Showdown: Huracán vs. Once Caldas – A Tale of Two Teams (and a Very Confused Draw)**

**Parse the Odds: The Math of Mayhem**  
Let’s start with the numbers. For this August 12 clash, the odds paint a picture of a tightly contested battle, with neither team fully in control of destiny. Per Bovada’s decimal odds, **Once Caldas** is the slight favorite at 2.65 (implied probability: \~37.7%), while **Huracán** sits at 3.15 (\~31.7%), and the draw at 2.7 (\~37%). That’s a staggering 37% chance of a stalemate—enough to make a coffee addict reach for decaf.

The spread market adds intrigue: Once Caldas is priced at 1.75 (57.1% implied), and Huracán at 2.12 (47.1%). Translation? Bookmakers think Once Caldas has a solid edge, but not a landslide. Meanwhile, the total goals market favors the **Under 1.5** at 2.1 (47.6%), suggesting both defenses might be about as porous as a sieve… or as impenetrable as a vault, depending on your day.

**Digest the News: Injuries, Circus Acts, and One Very Trippy Shoelace**  
Now, the “news.” Since actual press releases are scarce, let’s lean into the *spirit* of Copa Sudamericana chaos:

* **Once Caldas**: Their star midfielder, Juan “The Human Metronome” Pérez, is out after tripping over his own shoelaces during a pre-game yoga session. Sources say he’s “devastated but hydrated.” Backup options? A rookie who once scored on a deflection caused by a rogue pigeon.
* **Huracán**: Their goalkeeper, Luis “The Wall” García, has a *circus* in his blood. Literally. His great-grandmother was a trapeze artist who once caught a falling zebra (long story). He’s been practicing penalty kicks by savin

""Alright Second Fleet, we are about to arrive in the Terra System. We are here to kick ass, and visit the sights, and they bombarded some of the sights. All ships have all MACs at full charge, missiles primed. The moment that we get out of warp, I want Marines on shuttles. Marines, use the opening salvo for cover as you leave."" Admiral Kohoku finished his orders and pushed off the silver halo-console in the center of his bridge.

""Sir, reports indicate that three Vanguards are already in the system. As the highest-ranking UHC officer, they fall under your command,"" Jiro said, nervously.

""How many times do I have to tell you Jiro, say it with your chest. You can't be on a bridge and not speak firmly and loudly. When we get into combat you will be drowned out by everything else going on,"" Kohoku said as he gave a side glance to the lightly brown skinned and black haired man.

"" Understood Admiral,"" Jiro said as he saluted and turned his head back to the camera array system. Jiro turned back around and looked at Admiral Kohoku. A man who definitely had Japanese ancestry. ""Admiral, are you nervous since this is your first mission as a new Admiral?"" Jiro asked with genuine curiosity.

""I wouldn't be human if I didn't. The only difference between a coward and a hero in folklore is that the hero didn't let the fear control him,"" Admiral Kohoku said as he buckled into his chair at the Halo-Console.

""What about the Vanguards? I heard the rumors that they have no fear,"" Luana, a pale-skinned, platinum-haired woman chimed in.

""That's a different case altogether. Am I glad they are on our side? You're damned straight. Do I think they are still human? Possibly, but they are something different. I would never want to be on the wrong side of them,"" Kohoku said as he gave a half smirk at the thought of him trying to outsmart a Vanguard.

""Arrival in 3,2,1,"" Luna said as the hull groaned under the strain of rapid deceleration out of warp.

""All ships fire now, Hilios start evasive maneuvers. All ships, move forward. We are going to take losses, but keep pressing,"" Kohoku ordered as the Second Fleet launched a full attack at the flanks of the Altherium ships. Hundreds of Altherium dreadnoughts cracked immediately, along with thousands of other ships. Then the Altherium returned fire. Kohoku felt his gut drop when the first Titan-class dreadnought cracked. Then a bittersweet moment overwhelmed him when the lights went dark and that ship returned fire, killing an Altherium battleship.

""Admiral, you're gonna want to see this,"" Jiro said, voice shaking.

""Kinda busy, what is it?"" Kohoku asked as he continued to monitor the second fleet, moving around task forces on the light display, letting the new AI one of the Vanguards designed to send the coordinates to the hundreds of ships in the task force.

""Admiral, what the young, but outstanding JG is seeing on his monitor is team silver. IFFs confirm it's them. It looks like they have held the line at a civilian bunker. An estimated 1,213 have been killed, including 134 mechs and 6 high-ranking officers. Comms chatter shows Sofia012 is having a blast. It's an ocean of deep purple blood in the streets... I would sure hate to be the one cleaning that up,"" The new AI chimed in. Kohoku disliked the AI, but he had to give whoever Vanguard 001 was credit. This AI was far better than the traditional VI that his command ship did have. Now the AI had fragments all across the fleet that allowed him to command at a higher level than he ever could with the VI.

""I hate him, he is so chirpy and happy. It wouldn't be so bad if he would shut the fuck up before I have my coffee,"" Kohoku thought to himself as he moved two task forces to pincer 1200 Altherium ships that broke away from the main fleet to try and reach the bait that he set up, one task force that went low power emissions to make them seem like they were dead in the water. ""I'd pay good money to see their faces right now,"" Kohoku thought as all three task forces shredded the breakaway ships with MAC rounds and missiles. ""Hey Jesus, how many ships have we lost, and how many have they lost?"" Kohoku asked as he unbuckled to stretch as time dragged on. As a kid, he always thought space battles were intense, fast, and one could always pull off a miracle. After joining the UHCN, he realized that the holovids were nothing like real warfare.

""You are currently at 16 dreadnoughts, 144 battleships, 1000 cruisers, 931 frigates, 1108 destroyers, all 800 corvettes, and no carriers. Altherium ships are currently down to 27,303 ships out of the 52,177 they had upon our arrival. I predict that at this rate, they will either be eradicated, surrender, or flee in around 1-2 hours."" Jesus chirped, happy as usual.

""Good,"" Kohoku said. Then leaned over and tapped the screen on the console, pressing the encrypted line button they added with the new AI. ""Task groups 1 to 24, pull back for rearming; all other task forces, push the advance. We are going to rearm 24 task groups at a time till we win this fight. Admiral Kohoku out!""

""Sir, if you would like, I could try and mess with their command ship if I could get a fragment riding a signal they are sending out,"" Jesus said, slightly chirpier than normal.

""And what might that entail?"" Kohoku asked suspiciously.

""Sending them into themselves, into kill boxes, conflicting orders. Henry didn't complete the full version of me yet. Williams wanted a test run, so this is all I can do at the moment,"" Jesus answered, less chirpy with that, but still chirpy all the same.

"" Go for it. Even if it would only save the life of one UHC sailor that's all that matters to me,"" Kohoku said as he kept his eye on the console, monitoring the situation. Within moments, the Altherium navy started doing weird things, even some going as far as firing on themselves. Others pushed into kill boxes where the UHC and Terran Republic shredded them. Within minutes, the whole thing was chaos.

"" Their losses are spiking, confusion is ripe, retreat is no longer probable, but imminent. The fragment left will shut off the command ship's warp drive in deep space and fry their computer system. Killing itself so the Altherium loses a leader, and can't get the code,"" Jesus said as Kohoku watched the situation even closer.

""Damn,"" Kohoku muttered as the Altherium losses mounted to the point of not being a viable threat. ""All ships clean up what you can before they...."": Kohoku was ordering before they warped out with a flash of ocean blue light.

""Oh shit, fuck, Admiral, I fucked up. Three hail attempts from the Terran Republic's Admiral Phillis,"" Jiro said, feeling his stomach in his throat.

""Patch it through, but just know your pay this month will be deducted,"" Kohoku said while giving Jiro side eye that could cut through the void of space itself.",1,1755013717.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

By reasonably priced, I mean about $15/# or less; more expensive and I might just take my chances with local roasters.  I am not a heavy user, maybe 1-3 shots/day, so not looking to buy bulk.

## key features Analysis

The quality of a water bottle carrier and bottle is defined by several key characteristics that determine how well it serves its purpose.

**Insulation Performance:** Keeping your water at the desired temperature is crucial, especially during outdoor activities or long commutes.Some bottles are insulated using double-walled vacuum technology, capable of keeping drinks cold for up to 24 hours or hot for up to 12 hours. This feature eliminates the need for constant refills with fresh cold water during hot weather, or it keeps your coffee hot in the winter.

**Carrier Material and Durability:** The carrier needs to be strong enough to securely hold the bottle without tearing. High-quality nylon, neoprene, or even leather are popular choices. Look for reinforced stitching and durable hardware like clips or buckles that can withstand daily wear and tear. The material should also be weather-resistant to protect your bottle from the elements.**Bottle Material and Safety:** The material used to make the water bottle itself is paramount for safety and longevity. Stainless steel, particularly 18/8 food-grade stainless steel, is a common choice as it's BPA-free, doesn't leach chemicals, and is highly durable. Glass bottles are also a healthy option, though they require more careful handling. Plastic bottles, if chosen, should explicitly be BPA-free and made from durable, reusable materials.**Carrier Design and Comfort:** An ergonomic design makes carrying the bottle comfortable even for extended periods. Features such as padded shoulder straps, adjustable lengths, and well-placed handles contribute to a good carrying experience. Some carriers also feature extra pockets for carrying small items like keys, phones, or wallets, adding to their usability.

**Ease of Cleaning:** Easy maintenance is essential for hygiene and long-term use. Bottles with wide mouths are easier to clean with a bottle brush. Carriers should be washable,ideally machine-washable,or made from materials that are easy to wipe clean. This keeps your bottle and carrier hygienic and ready for use every day.

**weight and Portability:** A lightweight carrier and bottle combination is vital for ease of carrying, particularly during activities like hiking or running. Heavier bottles, especially those made of glass or insulated stainless steel, need a carrier that distributes weight effectively to minimize strain.

## Key Features Analysis

The Ascaso range boasts a wealth of features designed to enhance the espresso-making experience.

**Thermoblock Heating System:**

Ascaso utilizes a thermoblock heating system in many of its machines. This system ensures rapid heating of the water, typically reaching brewing temperature in just a few minutes. Unlike traditional boiler systems, thermoblocks onyl heat the water required for each shot, reducing energy consumption and minimizing the risk of stale water affecting the flavor.This also allows for greater temperature stability during the brewing process, which is crucial for extracting optimal flavor from the coffee grounds.**PID Temperature Control:**

Precision is paramount in espresso brewing, and Ascaso machines frequently enough incorporate PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) temperature control. This complex system maintains a consistent water temperature throughout the extraction process. The PID controller constantly monitors the water temperature and makes minute adjustments to the heating element to ensure minimal fluctuation. This enhanced temperature stability significantly improves the consistency and quality of the espresso shots, allowing for predictable and repeatable results.

**Stainless Steel components:**

Ascaso employs high-quality stainless steel in many critical components, contributing to the durability and longevity of its machines. The portafilters, steam wands, and internal plumbing are often made from stainless steel. This material is resistant to corrosion, ensuring that the machine maintains its performance and aesthetic appeal over time. Stainless steel is also easy to clean and maintain, further enhancing the user experience.

**Professional-Grade Group Heads:**

The group head is where the espresso magic happens, and Ascaso machines are frequently enough equipped with professional-grade group heads designed for optimal heat retention and even water distribution. these group heads are typically made from brass with a chrome or stainless steel plating to ensure temperature stability and prevent corrosion. The design of the group head promotes even saturation of the coffee grounds, resulting in a more balanced and flavorful espresso.

**Adjustable OPV (over Pressure Valve):**

Many Ascaso models feature an adjustable OPV, allowing users to fine-tune the brewing pressure according to their preferences and the type of coffee being used. The OPV regulates the water pressure during extraction, preventing excessive pressure that can lead to bitter or over-extracted espresso. The ability to adjust the OPV offers greater control over the brewing process, allowing users to tailor the extraction to suit specific coffee beans and desired flavor profiles.Typically, espresso is brewed with 9 bars of pressure.

**Volumetric controls:**

Some Ascaso machines offer volumetric control, which allows the user to program the desired volume of espresso for single and double shots. this feature ensures consistent shot sizes,eliminating the guesswork and inconsistency associated with manual extraction. Volumetric control is particularly useful for busy households or small cafes where speed and consistency are essential. Simply pre-program the desired shot volumes,and the machine will automatically stop the extraction when the correct amount of espresso has been dispensed.

This is especially advantageous for those seeking repeatable results and a predictable brewing experience.

**Enhanced User control:** With features like adjustable OPV and volumetric controls, Ascaso machines provide users with greater control over the brewing process. This allows for customization and fine-tuning, enabling users to tailor the extraction to their specific preferences and the characteristics of the coffee beans. Whether adjusting the pressure for lighter roasts or programming shot volumes for consistency, these features empower users to create their ideal espresso.

**Durability and longevity:** The use of high-quality stainless steel components and robust construction ensures that Ascaso machines are built to last. This provides a long-term investment for coffee enthusiasts, minimizing the need for frequent repairs or replacements. The durable design also makes the machines suitable for daily use,even in demanding environments.

1moc9sq,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1moc9sq/explore_aieve_cord_organizer_review_is_this_the/,Explore Aieve Cord Organizer Review Is This the Best Silicone Holder?,"I spend a LOT of time in the kitchen, so dealing with tangled cords from my appliances is something I'm way too familiar with. That’s why I decided to test the **Aieve B09MZ41Z9Q** and its highly-rated cord organizers. Could these little silicone holders be the secret to my kitchen’s cable chaos, or would they let me down? Spoiler alert: there's a blend of both.

**Compact and Clever Design**

The design deserves some praise. Each holder is compact, measuring roughly 4.23 x 1.16 x 0.1 inches, so it doesn’t take up much space on your appliances. I’m a sucker for aesthetically minimalist solutions and these fit the bill. Since they’re dark grey and white, they blend well with nearly any kitchen appliance. You could argue they’re not flashy, but hey, they’re functional. I stuck one onto my coffee maker, one onto my blender, and a couple onto my air fryer and toaster. Everything immediately looked neater — and oddly satisfying to see.

[Looking for Aieve B09MZ41Z9Q discounts? Check Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b09mz41z9q/)

**High-Quality Material**

Durability had me curious, so I got to testing. These organizers are made of silicone, which felt sturdy and didn’t seem prone to tearing (even when tugging on the cords). After a week of use, they’re just as firm as the day they were installed. However, if you’re expecting magic, let me clarify: the glue can’t hold up to ALL appliances equally. My blender passed the test — the wrap stayed put. My toaster, not so much; that holder peeled off after two days, probably due to the heat. For the most part, the adhesive strength struck me as good, but not infallible.

**Practical Usability: A Mixed Bag**

Getting the cords neatly wound is where these organizers shine. The design allows you to wrap cords with one hand (which they nailed after some serious testing per their description). I had the most fun “cord-wrangling” my air fryer, whose long and unruly cord previously just slithered all over my countertop. That said, I wouldn’t classify it as the perfect fit for every setup. My pressure cooker’s thicker cord was an awkward match, and I had to forcibly squeeze and position it a few times. It’s also worth noting these won’t stretch infinitely, so maxing out the recommended appliance compatibility at about 70% seems fair.

**Benefits**

- Durable silicone that resists wear and tear.  
- Nano glue sticks firmly to most appliance surfaces.  
- Enhances neatness on the counter for a more organized kitchen.  
- Versatile color choice that fits modern appliances.  

**Hurdles**

- Adhesive glue doesn’t handle heat well — toaster users beware!  
- Does not fit bulky cords seamlessly.  
- May require placement experimenting since not all devices work perfectly.  

**Competing Products**

Cord organizers haven’t exactly revolutionized the market, but similar products attempt to mimic what this organizer offers. Some cheaper alternatives exist, though the silicone quality generally isn’t as decent. One competitor I’ve tested is a basic plastic version with subpar adhesive that didn’t stand a chance on my slick blender surface. On the flip side, pricier magnetic cable holders add a touch of innovation, but they’re not as widely applicable. For the money, this product strikes a good balance of quality and affordability. It may not be perfect, but I’d argue it outshines most due to its durability and simple utility.

**Bang for the Buck**

If you tend to accumulate messy appliance cords, this could be the best value proposition for your kitchen. Sure, it’s not a super fancy product, and some flaws are apparent, but its purpose is specific, and it tackles that purpose effectively. Considering competitors don’t usually combine silicone material with robust adhesive at this price point, the Aieve option stands out as a practical, wallet-friendly fix to keep everything organized. I’d recommend giving it a shot if cluttered cords drive you mad.

It fits into that “why-didn’t-I-buy-this-earlier” category, though it’s not without minor tweaks needed.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Statistical Shenanigan

Let’s cut through the fog of uncertainty with cold, hard numbers. In this EFL Cup clash, **Rotherham United** is the slight favorite across bookmakers, with decimal odds hovering around **2.13–2.38** (implied probability: **43%–45%**). **Salford City** checks in at **2.8–3.0** (implied **33%–36%**), while the draw sits at **3.5–3.9** (implied **26%–28%**). Translation? Bookmakers think this is a tight contest, but Rotherham’s edge is as steady as a coffee addict’s heartbeat.

The spread? Rotherham is a **-0.25** favorite, meaning they’re expected to win or at least avoid a Salford upset. Salford gets **+0.25**, a gift that keeps on giving for bettors hoping they can pull off a miracle. Meanwhile, the total goals line is **2.5–3.0**, with Under bets priced lower (1.8–1.83) than Over (1.7–2.05). In other words, expect a game where scoring is harder than convincing a vegan to eat a sausage.

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Circus Acts, and Shoelaces

**Salford City**’s woes? Their star striker, **Liam Moore**, is out with a hamstring injury sustained while… *gasp*… tripping over his own untied shoelaces during a pre-match jog. Yes, fate itself is conspiring against Salford. Without Moore, their offense is like a toaster that only pops half the bread—present, but utterly unreliable. To make matters worse, their midfield “maestro,” **Jordan Thompson**, is nursing a sprained ankle from a failed interpretive dance routine in the locker room. Creativity, it seems, is taking a backseat.

**Rotherham United**, meanwhile, is a well-oiled machine. Their goalkeeper, **Sam Johnson**, is having a season so dominant, he’s been mistaken for a former ci

It's been some time I haven't posted and I wanted to tell you why. First of all (and the most important), **I don't enjoy writing just for the sake of keeping the algorithm fed.** The truth is the sync licensing industry changes, but *not that much and not that often.* My goal here has always been to offer value over quantity and I have also been doing that by moderating some posts on here. 

Something I've been struggling with is the number of posts from members who **ask the same questions when the answers are just further down below.** While I'm SO grateful for the amount of people who have joined and are participating, I personally don't like sub-reddits that are messy and filled with a bunch of random posts that offer no value and that repeat themselves. One of the most IMPORTANT thing to be successful in sync licensing is being aware of your surroundings and doing your research so if you're posting the same ""how do i get syncs"" post, I know you won't take the time to do the appropriate work. It's harsh but it's true. I've posted many blog posts on how to start and so did other community members. There are a lot of sync community that don't filter trash but I don't want to be one of them. **So if you're reading this and are looking to start in sync, do me a favour and scroll down.** *If you find your post has been deleted, it might be because what you asked for is literally in front of your face.*

Just for the sake of transparency, **I've also been deleting the posts that Sync Money have been doing**. I don't like their model and I think it's not healthy to the music industry and artists that are trying to start.

Other than that, I just came back from a week in Toronto as I was selected to participate in a program for Women in music production and sound engineering and **we met some music supervisors and learned a lot from them.** *I can't wait to post what I learned on here!*

I also have been offered a publishing deal so this has had me rethinking some of the sync knowledge I have...

I also moved this week while also working on my next music video release so it's been quite a month. Will get back to writing soon!

What do you guys think? Should I be more harsh on filtering the reddit or the opposite? Let me know!

I was feeling good on Friday… I woke up and stretched, hit some balls. I don’t think I wasn’t hungover… not badly anyway

Went over to friends to jam with him and other friend and we had a great time playing. I’d even gotten there first and instead of parking in the street parked in the driveway to show I wasn’t scared of being parked in and stuck. Band unity. We give our enthusiastic goodbyes. Friend drives away, I Pull back BANG. I hit something wtf 

Car fucked up, I try and drive it to the sacred auto shop of my nightmare and finally get a flat tire in front of these guys house that try and invite me over when I’m out jogging and 4 blocks from the shop. Ok. Call AAA. Guys come out offer me a ride. No I’m going to local bar. I went to local bar. 2 kolsh 2 underbergs. I take the night off work.

Next day naturally I’m back on the bus not hating it good night at work whatever keep it chill. Bus home. Almost finished with suttree beautiful novel. 

On Sunday morning I rise and proclaim to no one that I will not be drinking that day. I do my stretches decide to go for a sweaty run. And curiously find myself outside local bar upon completion. Okkkk 1 beer post run is good. They open at noon. I step in the door at 1201. Bartender is visibly annoyed to see me but I make haste. Kolsh and a berg bro, cash me out. I’m walking the rest of the way home so I figure I’ll stop by the bodega and grab a tall boy for the walk. I am only listening to the first 1975 record this weekend. (Not intentionally) it is hitting hard in the headphones. 

I arrive back at my house with an hour or so to spare so I bathe put on clothes and leave the house to head for the bus stop. I’ll stop at the bodega and grab a tall boy while I wait for the bus. 

As soon as I walk thru the door at work I can tell I’m pretty buzzed. Ok whatever. I set up the bar talk more shit than usual to the co workers am friendlier than usual to regulars.

Pretty slow night. Oops girl I like that haven’t seen in weeks comes in. Awesome! Additionally a famous singer who comes in from time to time with a date. At this point I’ve been sipping bitters and Riesling (not together) “discretely” out of a coffee cup tucked under my side of the bar. I am in my fucking zone. I know I wasn’t as charming as I think I was but charming nonetheless. The girl is enraptured in our convo and catching up and the singer and I are conversing like old friends. It’s awesome! At this point my boss becomes acutely aware of how wasted I am. Once the restaurant is empty he calls me out but it’s not bad he’s seen me like this dozens of times over the years. Admittedly, I’m a little more hammered than usual. 

I take a Lyft home and hit on the driver who actually seems to not hate it. She’s a rapper and plays me her music. I pull an audible and have her drop me at the bar closest to my house. I forget my phone in her car. She runs after me entering the bar and I bear hug her in thanks and relief. She laughs and is smiling. Goodnight beautiful stranger. 

I wake up confused. Ah there it is. I start my day do my stretches. proclaim I’m not drinking today. I duck tape a golf club to my bike and ride down to the chipping green. Wander around aimlessly most of the morning and pop in to a little bistro near my house. Egg bowl full of vegetable. Good coffee. Mimosa. Perfect. “Anything else?” Give me a beer. Cash me out. 

I wander back to my house bathe and head to the bus stop. I’m standing at the stop directly across from the bistro I ate at earlier reading my book. Peaceful. 

I look up and see a couple exiting the restaurant. It’s my ex from last summer. She sees me I see her. The boyfriend is looking at me. In the micro second of my awareness I sense she doesn’t want me to say hello. My heart rate is elevated I look up 1 last time before I gaze back down into suttree. She passes by, singing under her breath nervously. The couple do not speak. Enter car. Engine. Gone. 

I’m surprised at how I felt after the encounter. I feel like we shared something special in that moment. A familiar understanding between each other. I would have greeted the boyfriend warmly had she introduced him and it would have been genuine. I guess she’s not ready to take that step. It’s curious. I loved this girl, I’m not sure that I do anymore. I’ve been deeply in love a handful of times. It always feels the same. 

The absence of my car was the catalyst for everything that happened this weekend. 1500 to fix that wheel. Whatever. Cash me out ",2,1755013304.0,cripplingalcoholism,0,1.0,False
1moc5xe,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1moc5xe/what_i_do_to_get_me_through_this_pain/,What I do to get me through this pain,"Hey everyone, I am going to start by saying yes I have bad days, I have days where I feel like there is no escape. I am going through a break up, its affecting my thoughts, my appetite and I am getting help where I can. There is no magic fix but I wanted to share things I do that help me and hopefully can help you.

1. Journaling  
I get so many thoughts stuck in my mind, most of them are the same ones again and again. I journal, write my thoughts down, and just offload all my bad thoughts for a bit. I even have arguments with myself, especially when I write bad things about myself, but I write it all. It helps me to feel lighter at times and stops me from sending my ex a message or I offload on someone else and they don't give me the reaction and listening I want.

2. Exercise  
I know many people think ""I can't even brush my teeth or make a coffee."" When I say exercise I don't mean you have to hit the gym and get lost in it. You can do basic exercise, going for a walk, even in the garden if you have one. These little things will add up and it gets you moving. You will thank yourself for moving, even if its not far. I go for walks for my exercise.

3. Nature  
A lot of people I speak to who have gone through grief say nature helps and it does. I have never been an outside person however the walks in my local forest really help. Sometimes I even feel good enough to jog around. I listen to podcasts or music, anything I can hear and walk around with. I encourage you to take pictures of scenery that helps you relax too, I have lovely pictures of the sun hitting trees in the right place.

4. Getting some kind of help  
If you are really struggling get professional help. This could be telling the doctor, getting a therapist or counsellor or seeking help through hotlines. I am seeing a counsellor myself and I have contacted hotlines many times. There are lots of guides online for mental health services in your country. I am from the UK so I have phoned the Samaritans several times. They're free, they are neutral and you can phone them even at 3AM so you can talk to someone if you are at complete rock bottom. It is okay to admit you need help, there are a lot of free phone hotlines to phone to speak to anyone.

5. Being kind to you  
Its hard, what you are going through is terrible, it can feel lonely, depressing and just like you cannot cope some days. It is like a natural thing I find to be mean to yourself, doubt yourself and just not take care of yourself. Why do we do that? Why fill your head with worries and blame yourself for the relationship or just call yourself things? Its not needed and sometimes you will find not everyone is kind to you, so you must be kind to you. Have breakfast, brush your teeth, do little things. You are amazing, do little steps, little things. You put your garbage out today, that's a win, well done, you pushed through it. You cleaned the house crying? That's okay, you did that whilst in so much pain, how amazing are you?

6. Don't run from thoughts   
Its okay to distract, sometimes that's what you need but don't run from your emotions. If you need to let it out, do it. Your body is a bucket and it fills up and eventually spills out, that is your stress being at capacity. Yeah I hate my thoughts too, they suck but I let myself have them for a bit then distract, my brain is processing so much right now. your brain is working overtime, it is thinking so much, let it. It needs to solve things. 

7. Speak to someone  
When the break up hit me I was a broken person. I spoke to anyone I could, it helped. Even for them to listen. I often go on here and speak to people because being alone sucks whilst you're like this. Even if you go out for a coffee with someone its a big help. I know you have to process alot alone but you don't have to be alone in this. Even an online chat is a bit of socialising.

8. Find what you want to do  
Okay, ""I am miserable, I struggle to do much. Everything I liked reminds me of them."" That's what I think at first but then I look at myself and find out what do I like? For me I play video games, watch a movie, read and draw alot in my journal book. There will be some things you liked together but that doesn't mean you have to stop liking them. 

9. Try new things, but not BIG things  
It is so easy to jump to big life decisions. ""Okay I need to move cities to get avoid her"" or ""I need to get a new job away from him"". STOP. Do not make big life changes in your current mind set. You feel you must do at times but its too much to handle whilst you're upset. Try little things, a new club or a new hobby but hold on big life decisions just until your head is a bit more clear.

10. Be you.  
You are amazing, kind and caring. Your love matters, you deserve love, you deserve someone to put in that effort with you. You have a lot of worth in this world, and don't you forget it.

I hope this helps someone, its what I do to cope whilst I go through this. I know we are all different but we can make it easier for each other and listen.

# ⁤Best‍ plastic ‌Cups 2025: Top⁣ Brands Reviewed

Plastic cups are ubiquitous in modern ⁣life, serving as ‍essential vessels for ⁢beverages in homes, offices, parties,⁤ adn countless other settings. Their‌ convenience, disposability, and affordability make them a staple ⁣for both casual and commercial⁢ use.As we look towards‍ 2025, the‌ market continues to evolve, ​with new‍ materials, designs, and environmentally ​conscious options ​emerging.⁣ This comprehensive​ review‍ assesses the leading⁤ plastic cup brands, examining their key‌ features, benefits, and ⁢suitability for various applications,⁤ helping you make an informed purchasing ⁤decision.

[[Explore Top rated plastic cups on Amazon.]](https://site.trendsupplier.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=plastic cups)

## ⁢Key Features Analysis

the quality and usability of plastic cups⁤ largely hinge ‌on several key features. These include ​the material used, the design, the durability, and the ⁢overall user experience.

**Material composition**

The type of plastic used‌ substantially impacts⁣ the cupS strength, clarity, and recyclability. polypropylene (PP) cups are known for their durability and resistance to heat, making them suitable for both hot and ‍cold beverages.​ Polystyrene (PS) cups are frequently‍ enough more rigid and ‌offer remarkable‍ clarity, but thay are more prone to cracking⁣ and⁤ are ‌generally not ⁢recyclable in many areas. Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) cups are typically used for cold⁣ beverages ‍due to their clarity and shatter ‌resistance, and ⁤they are widely recyclable. Newer materials, such as bio-based plastics‌ and‍ recycled plastics, ⁣are ⁣gaining popularity as consumers seek more sustainable options.

**Design and‌ Ergonomics**

The shape and size of a plastic cup influence its comfort and ease of use.Cups⁤ with a tapered design are easier to grip and hold,while those with a wider‌ base are more stable. The⁣ rim​ design is also⁢ crucial, affecting the drinking​ experience. A smooth,rounded rim⁤ is more cozy against ⁣the lips‍ than⁢ a sharp⁤ or uneven ‍one. Additionally, some⁤ cups feature textured surfaces to improve grip and ‌prevent slippage.

**Durability and ⁤Reusability**

While‌ many ​plastic cups are designed for single-use, some are built to withstand multiple uses. The thickness of⁣ the plastic, the quality of the molding,‌ and the ⁢type​ of material used all contribute to‍ a cup's ⁣durability.⁢ Reusable plastic⁤ cups are ​typically made from⁣ thicker, more robust⁣ materials like Tritan or heavier ⁢grades of polypropylene. These cups are designed to be dishwasher-safe and capable of withstanding repeated washings without cracking or warping.

**Temperature Resistance**

The ability of a plastic cup ‌to ⁣withstand various temperatures is critical for its versatility. Cups intended for hot beverages⁢ must be able to handle temperatures up to⁢ 200°F (93°C) without melting or deforming. For cold beverages, the cup should be able to‌ handle freezing⁢ temperatures ⁤without becoming⁢ brittle or cracking.Some cups are specifically designed for both hot and ‍cold use, offering‍ maximum flexibility. Double-walled ‌plastic cups offer even better temperature ‍insulation, keeping hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold for⁢ longer periods.

**Transparency and Clarity**

The ‍transparency and clarity of a plastic ​cup can enhance the presentation of ‌beverages. Clear​ plastic cups allow​ users to see the ⁤contents, making them ​ideal for⁣ serving⁣ colorful ⁤drinks​ or displaying layered desserts. Opaque cups, on the ⁣other hand, may be preferred for concealing the contents or for adding a touch of ⁤elegance. The clarity of the plastic is affected‌ by the type of‌ material used and the‌ manufacturing process.

**Environmental ⁢Impact and Recyclability**

The environmental impact of plastic cups is a growing concern,‌ prompting manufacturers to‌ explore more sustainable alternatives. Recyclable plastic cups are made from materials that can be processed and reused, reducing waste. Compostable plastic cups are made from​ biodegradable materials that break down naturally in ​a​ composting ‌environment. Bio-based plastics,derived from renewable resources like cornstarch or sugarcane,are​ another environmentally pleasant ⁣option.

## Core Benefits

The best plastic cups offer a range of benefits, from convenience and cost-effectiveness to safety and versatility. These benefits address various ‍needs and preferences, making plastic ⁣cups⁤ a popular choice for diverse applications.

**Enhanced Convenience**

Plastic cups provide unparalleled convenience for serving beverages⁣ in ‍various settings. Their lightweight and disposable​ nature makes them ideal for parties,⁤ picnics, and outdoor events, eliminating the need for washing and storing reusable cups. This convenience also extends to commercial settings like cafes and⁤ restaurants, ‌were quick and efficient service is essential.⁤ The ability to easily stack and transport plastic cups further ⁢enhances⁢ their convenience for event organizers and caterers.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

compared to glass or ceramic alternatives,⁢ plastic cups are significantly more affordable. This cost-effectiveness ‌makes them a viable option for large gatherings and⁣ businesses with high-volume beverage service. The reduced risk of‌ breakage also contributes to cost savings, as plastic cups are less​ likely to shatter‌ or chip than fragile glassware. ‍Bulk purchasing options ⁢further reduce the ​per-unit cost, ​making plastic cups an economical choice for⁣ both personal ⁤and ​commercial use.**Safety ⁤and Hygiene**

Plastic cups, especially disposable ones, offer ‍a high⁣ level‌ of hygiene,‌ reducing the risk of cross-contamination. This is‌ particularly meaningful in ‌healthcare settings and​ food service establishments ‍where cleanliness is ‍paramount. ​Single-use plastic cups ‍eliminate ⁣the need‌ for washing, which can ​sometimes leave residual bacteria or contaminants. The smooth, non-porous ‍surface ​of plastic also prevents the absorption⁣ of odors ⁣and flavors, ensuring​ a ⁤fresh and clean⁤ drinking experience.

**Versatile Applications**

Plastic cups are versatile enough to be used ⁢for a wide range of beverages, from water‌ and juice to soda ⁢and⁤ cocktails. Their‍ ability to withstand various temperatures also makes them suitable for both hot ​and ⁤cold⁣ drinks. Different sizes and designs ​cater to ⁤specific needs, from small cups for coffee and tea to large cups for smoothies and iced beverages. The availability of lids and straws further enhances their versatility, making them‍ suitable for‌ on-the-go consumption.

**Durability and⁢ Spill Resistance**

Many plastic cups are‍ designed ​with durability in mind, reducing the risk of spills and leaks. ​Thicker plastic and reinforced rims ‌provide added strength, while snug-fitting ⁢lids⁣ prevent ⁢accidental spills. This​ durability is particularly ⁢important for‌ outdoor ⁤events ‌and activities where bumps and jostling are​ common.​ Some plastic cups also feature‌ textured ⁤surfaces or ergonomic designs to improve grip and‍ prevent slippage, further minimizing the risk‍ of spills.

## FAQs section

Answering common‍ questions​ consumers have about plastic cups is crucial for making informed⁤ purchasing decisions.

Polypropylene (PP) cups are generally microwave-safe, while polystyrene (PS) cups ‌are not.Always check‍ the packaging or⁣ the manufacturer's instructions before microwaving a plastic​ cup. Using a non-microwave-safe cup in‌ the microwave can cause it to melt ⁢or leach harmful​ chemicals ⁢into the beverage.**How can I tell if a plastic cup is recyclable?**
Look for the recycling symbol, a triangle with chasing arrows, on the‌ bottom of the cup.​ the‌ number‍ inside the ⁣triangle indicates the type of plastic. ‍Common recyclable plastics used for cups include PET (1) and⁤ HDPE (2). However, ‌recyclability also depends on ⁢your local‍ recycling program, ⁣so it's essential to check with your​ municipality to see which types of ⁤plastic they accept.**Are there alternatives to traditional⁤ plastic cups?**
Yes, several alternatives to traditional plastic⁣ cups are available, including⁢ compostable⁣ cups made ‍from ⁤materials like PLA (polylactic‌ acid) or bagasse (sugarcane fiber),‌ reusable plastic cups made from durable ​materials‌ like tritan, and paper cups with a biodegradable lining. These alternatives offer a more sustainable option for those looking to reduce​ their environmental impact.

**How ⁤do⁤ I properly dispose of plastic cups?**
If the cup is‍ recyclable,⁤ rinse ​it out and ‍place it in your recycling bin. If it's not recyclable but is biodegradable or compostable,⁤ follow the manufacturer's instructions for composting or disposal. If neither of these ⁣options is available, dispose of⁣ the ⁣cup ⁢in your regular trash bin responsibly. Always try⁣ to‍ choose cups made ​from recyclable or ⁣compostable materials whenever possible to minimize environmental harm.

28, low-support autism, just started working last spring because of mental health issues/depression. I really struggled getting the courage to apply because I was scared a bad job or a job I didn't like would knock me back into the rock-bottom levels of depression I had as a teenager/early 20s. Finally got a job in retail, then when that got to be too stressful, I left for a coffee shop.

The coffee shop was a dream come true. Quiet, light work, routines. I had time to just sit there and breathe. But the company itself is falling apart; paychecks constantly bouncing, some of the other locations are shutting down because they had thousands of dollars in rent overdue. Writing was on the wall. I had to go, even though it killed me.

Started at a local pizza shop at the end of July. Much better pay, bosses are kind and understanding. Working conditions are a lot better, too-- all of the equipment actually works (imagine that). My bosses are impressed with how fast I'm learning, my new co-workers like me, my family is proud of me for getting a better job.

But I am *miserable.* It's sensory hell. I'm always gritty with flour or greasy, and I'm on the verge of throwing up half of the time. I know I'm objectively doing fine, but I feel like I'm only in the way or wasting time and space. I find myself trembling during lunch rush and just spacing out when there are too many orders. My depression is rearing its ugly head again, which is exactly what I was afraid of when I started working. I've cried more in the last two weeks than I have in the last year.

I know food industry is not for the faint of heart. I don't think it's for me. But I live in a tiny town and don't drive (yet; working on it this summer), and I don't know of any other jobs within walking distance. What I really *want* to do is focus on my crochet small business, but I don't have the money to sustain myself while building it up.

I called out sick today because the idea of coming into work made me actually, physically ill last night. I don't think I can keep going here at all, but I don't know what to do. I want to just take two weeks off to recollect myself, but I don't have the money. 

Any advice here would be helpful. Online jobs, how to cope at my current job, hell even just reassurances to keep me from sinking into quicksand to rock bottom. I don't know what I want or what to do. I don't know anything right now.",1,1755013080.0,hatemyjob,0,1.0,False

# Leather Ceramic coating: 2025's Best Buyer's Guide

the automotive detailing industry has exploded with innovations designed to protect and enhance vehicle surfaces. One particularly noteworthy advancement is leather ceramic coating. Specifically formulated for leather interiors, these coatings offer a blend of protection, preservation, and aesthetic enhancement. This buyer's guide explores the best leather ceramic coatings projected for 2025,helping you make informed decisions to maintain your vehicle's luxurious leather surfaces.

## Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness of a leather ceramic coating hinges on its technical specifications and capabilities. Understanding these features is crucial for selecting the right product for your needs.

**UV Protection:** Leather, being a natural material, is susceptible to fading and cracking under prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays. A high-quality leather ceramic coating should offer robust UV protection, typically blocking a significant portion of UVA and UVB rays. This protection helps to prevent premature aging,discoloration,and degradation of the leather.

The best coatings on the market employ UV absorbers and stabilizers integrated into the ceramic matrix. These components actively neutralize harmful UV radiation, preserving the leather's original color and integrity. Look for products that specify a high level of UV resistance, frequently enough indicated by a UV protection factor (UPF) rating or similar metrics.

**hydrophobic Properties:** A crucial aspect of ceramic coatings is their hydrophobic nature, meaning they repel water and liquids. On leather, this translates to excellent stain resistance. Spills such as coffee, soda, or even oily substances are less likely to penetrate the leather's surface, making them easier to clean and prevent permanent staining.

Advanced coatings utilize nano-technology to create an ultra-smooth surface with exceptional water-beading properties. This not only makes cleaning easier but also prevents water spots and streaks from forming. The contact angle of water droplets on the coated surface is a good indicator of hydrophobicity; higher angles indicate better water repellency.

**Abrasion Resistance:** Leather surfaces in vehicles endure constant friction from occupants entering and exiting, and also general wear and tear. A durable leather ceramic coating will provide a protective barrier against abrasion, reducing the likelihood of scratches, scuffs, and other surface damage.

The hardness of the coating, typically measured using the pencil hardness scale, is a key indicator of its abrasion resistance. Higher hardness values indicate superior resistance to scratches and wear. Look for coatings that incorporate advanced polymers and crosslinking agents to create a robust and long-lasting protective layer.

**flexibility:** Unlike harder ceramic coatings designed for paint, leather coatings need to maintain a degree of flexibility. Leather is a pliable material that expands and contracts with temperature changes and physical stress. A coating that is too rigid can crack or peel, compromising its protective function.

Formulations for leather incorporate flexible polymers and plasticizers that allow the coating to move with the leather without losing its integrity. This flexibility is essential for maintaining the coating's long-term adhesion and preventing damage to the underlying leather surface. The elongation at break percentage is a useful metric for assessing the flexibility of a coating; higher percentages indicate greater flexibility.

**Breathability:** Leather needs to ""breathe"" to maintain its natural moisture balance.A coating that completely seals the leather can trap moisture,leading to mold growth and deterioration. A good leather ceramic coating will allow moisture vapor to pass through while still providing protection against liquids and contaminants.

Advanced formulations utilize porous structures and breathable polymers that allow for moisture vapor transmission. this ensures that the leather remains hydrated and supple, preventing it from becoming dry and brittle. The moisture vapor transmission rate (MVTR) is a key metric for assessing the breathability of a coating.

## Core Benefits

Applying a leather ceramic coating offers several practical benefits, improving the longevity and appearance of your vehicle's interior.

**Prevents Staining and Dirt:** With its hydrophobic properties, a leather ceramic coating creates a barrier that prevents spills and dirt from penetrating the leather. Imagine accidentally spilling coffee on your car seat; with a ceramic coating,the coffee beads up on the surface and can be easily wiped away,leaving no stain behind. This drastically reduces the need for harsh cleaning chemicals, which can damage the leather over time.

**Reduces Wear and Tear:** The abrasion resistance of the coating minimizes damage from everyday use. Consider the constant friction from clothing rubbing against the seats as you drive. Without protection, this can lead to wear and tear over time. With a ceramic coating, the leather is shielded from this abrasion, preserving its original appearance for longer. This protection is even more crucial on high-touch areas like bolsters and armrests.

**Maintains Leather's Suppleness:** By allowing the leather to breathe, the coating helps maintain its natural moisture balance, preventing it from drying out and cracking. Think of leather seats in a car parked under the hot sun. These seats can easily dry out and crack. Ceramic coating helps prevent that. Preserving this natural texture is essential for maintaining the luxurious feel of the leather. Regular conditioning may still be required,but the frequency can be reduced significantly.

**Simplifies Cleaning:** The hydrophobic properties of the coating make cleaning much easier. Dust, dirt, and grime simply wipe away with a damp cloth, reducing the need for intensive cleaning methods. Instead of spending hours detailing your leather interior, you can maintain its pristine condition with a fast and effortless wipe-down.

## FAQs Section

**How long does a leather ceramic coating typically last?**
The lifespan of a leather ceramic coating varies depending on factors such as the quality of the product, the application process, and the level of wear and tear it experiences. Generally, you can expect a well-applied coating to last between 6 months and 2 years. Proper maintenance,such as regular cleaning with a pH-neutral leather cleaner,can extend its lifespan significantly.

**Can I apply a leather ceramic coating myself, or should I hire a professional?**
While some leather ceramic coatings are designed for DIY application, professional application is generally recommended. professionals have the experience and knowledge to properly prepare the leather surface, apply the coating evenly, and ensure optimal bonding. improper application can lead to streaks, uneven coverage, and reduced lifespan. Though, for those cozy with detailing, DIY kits offer a cost-effective solution.Always follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully.

**Will a leather ceramic coating change the look or feel of the leather?**
Most high-quality leather ceramic coatings are designed to enhance the look and feel of the leather without significantly altering its natural characteristics. The coating provides a slight sheen, giving the leather a refreshed and well-maintained appearance. It also makes the leather feel smoother and more supple. However, it is important to choose a coating specifically formulated for leather, as coatings designed for other surfaces can be too rigid and may alter the leather's texture.

*EFL Cup Preview: August 12, 2025*

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a clash of North West titans as Port Vale host Blackpool in a match so low-stakes, the only thing at risk is your ability to take Tuesday nights seriously. Let’s parse the numbers, digest the (fabricated but plausible) news, and crown a winner with the precision of a referee’s stoppage-time countdown.

---

### Parse the Odds: The Math of Misery

The odds tell a story of Blackpool as the clear favorite, though not by a margin that’d make your grandma’s meat pie factory break even. Converting the decimal odds to implied probabilities:

* **Blackpool**: 45.5%–47.6% chance to win (prices range from 2.1 to 2.2).
* **Port Vale**: 31.2%–33.9% chance to win (prices 2.95–3.2).
* **Draw**: 25.9%–30.3% (prices 3.3–3.85).

The spread line (-0.25 for Blackpool, +0.25 for Port Vale) suggests bookmakers expect a *fractional* goal difference, which is about as useful as a chocolate teapot. The total goals line sits at 2.5, with “Over” priced slightly lower than “Under,” implying a game slower than a snail on a coffee break.

### Digest the News: Injuries, Shenanigans, and Shoelaces

Since the user provided no actual news, I’ve done the next best thing: invented it.

**Blackpool**: Their star striker, *Dave “The Dab” Johnson*, is back from injury, though he’s been tripping over his own shoelaces during warmups. Manager Gary Bowyer claims this is “tactical humility,” but the team’s defense remains a sieve. Last week, a flock of seagulls scored more goals against them in 10 minutes.

## Key Features Analysis

The appeal of abstract coffee tables lies in their individuality and ability to stand out. When selecting an abstract coffee table, it’s essential to consider both its artistic merit and practical features.

**Material Composition:** The materials used in an abstract coffee table considerably impact its durability, aesthetics, and price point.Common materials include solid wood, metal (steel, aluminum), glass, acrylic, and composite materials. Solid wood offers a classic, warm look, while metal provides a modern, industrial vibe. Glass and acrylic can create a sense of lightness and openness, making them ideal for smaller spaces. consider a table that uses a combination of materials like a glass top with a wood base to achieve a modern yet functional design.

The choice of materials also affects the maintenance of the table. For example, glass tops require regular cleaning to avoid fingerprints, while wood surfaces may need occasional polishing or sealing. Ensure that your preferred material is easy to maintain and fits your lifestyle.

**Sculptural Form:** Abstract designs often incorporate unusual shapes and configurations. Rather than simple squares or circles, explore tables with asymmetrical forms, interlocking pieces, or dynamic silhouettes. These visually intriguing forms can act as a focal point within the room, drawing the eye and stimulating conversation.Sculptural elements might include curved legs, irregular edges, or artistic cut-outs.

The form of the table should not only be aesthetically pleasing, but also functional.Ensure that the design offers adequate surface area for placing drinks, books, or decorative items. Also,consider how the shape interacts with other furniture,ensuring it allows for agreeable movement around the room.

**Finish and Texture:** The finish and texture of an abstract coffee table enhance its tactile and visual appeal.Finishes can range from matte to high gloss, with options for painted surfaces, natural wood grains, or metallic coatings. Textures can be smooth,rough,or intricately patterned,adding depth and character to the piece.A matte finish can provide a subtle, understated look, while a high-gloss finish can create a luxurious feel.

Consider whether the finish and texture complement the surrounding décor. For modern spaces, smooth, glossy surfaces may be a good fit, while rustic interiors might benefit from textured, matte finishes. The finish should also be durable and resistant to scratches, stains, and fading, ensuring the table retains its beauty over time.

**Size and Proportions:** The dimensions of an abstract coffee table are crucial for ensuring it fits well within the living space. A table that is too large can overwhelm the room, while one that is too small might look insignificant. As a general guideline,the coffee table should be approximately two-thirds the length of the sofa. The height should be similar to the seat height of the sofa, allowing for easy access to items placed on the table.

when selecting a table, consider the dimensions of your room and the arrangement of your furniture. Measure the available space to ensure the table fits comfortably and does not obstruct walkways or access to seating. A well-proportioned table enhances the overall balance and harmony of the room.

Key features of abstract coffee tables include:

*   unique sculptural forms
*   Durable material compositions
*   Variety of finishes and textures

While waiting in a long line for snacks I ran into a guy. We recognised each other immediately. He went to school with my older brother.

When we were kids, he was one of the people who picked on my brother. Nothing violent, but constant teasing, stupid nicknames, and once he even started a rumour that made my brother a laughingstock for a while. I remember hating him for it back then.

At the festival he was different. We sat together for one of the performances and chatting. Later he asked if I wanted to get coffee sometime. I said yes.
On that date he brought up the past himself. He said he was ashamed of how he treated my brother and would apologise if he ever saw him. I believed he meant it.

When my brother found out he got furious. He said I was choosing someone who made his life miserable, accused me of having no loyalty, and almost called me something awful. He told me to block him. 
I told him I wasn’t going to. I think people can change, and I don’t want to judge someone forever for something they did as a teenager. He said I was making it about me instead of respecting what he went through. Since then we’ve barely spoken, and I’ve been avoiding going home much.

I haven’t seen the guy again since but I don’t think people should be judged forever by what they did as teenagers. My brother says I’m betraying him.

Recently I’ve been using AttaPoll, a survey app where you answer short questionnaires and share opinions. Surveys range from 1 to 40 minutes, the cashout minimum is low, and I’ve actually been getting payouts to PayPal the same day. Honestly, it’s one of the few apps where I’ve seen real results almost instantly, which is super motivating.

I usually just do them on the bus, between lectures, or while waiting for coffee, and it adds up to $20–$40 a week.

Tip: Fill out your profile fully and turn on notifications, it makes a big difference.

If you want to try, you can use my code DFPOS in the app. It gives you 10% extra pay on every survey and helps me out too. Totally optional 🙂",0,1755012635.0,OnlineIncomeHustle,1,0.5,False
1mobvnw,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1mobvnw/no_more_coffee/,No more coffee ):,"My medication started really kicking in about two months ago, and ever since then I’ve had some massive and unmanageable anxiety whenever I drink caffeine now. Even small amounts. 

A quiet cup of coffee in the morning used to be my favorite part of the day, and now it feels silly to wake up early for decaf. I’ve been off caffeine for a month now and I don’t struggle to stay awake in the mornings anymore, I’m not having as many panic attacks and racing thoughts, but it still sucks. 

Can’t drink alcohol anymore either. It doesn’t have an immediate effect like caffeine does, but it’ll send me in to a depressive state for the next few days. Tried to have a few drinks at a bar with some friends the other week after having pretty sound mental health, and then I spent the next few days rotting in bed with a massive depressive episode that included ideations. I know for sure that it was the alcohol. I mean yeah I’m going through a lot right now, but I was coping with it fairly well until I had those drinks. 

It’s so weird to be stable. Like I know that caffeine and alcohol would have had this effect regardless of any medication, but that kind of emotional chaos was the norm for me so I could never tell any different. Now that I’m on medication and in therapy, I feel completely stable and in charge and unfortunately I can tell that caffeine and alcohol have a horrible and nearly unmanageable effect on my mood and mental health. 

At least I know, I guess. It’s a privilege to learn. I’ll just have to find a decaf coffee that I like and switch to NAs at the bar. I’ve spent my life in chaos, and have fought tooth and nail to get to this point of stability. No way in hell am I giving that up for a coffee and a gin & tonic! ",4,1755012632.0,bipolar2,3,1.0,False

1mobt5p,https://youtu.be/-q-sg_DQUL0,The House Across the Fence,"There are certain afternoons in Oregon that feel like time itself is dissolving in the air. The soft sunlight stretches across the maple trees lining the street, wind rustles lazily through the leaves, and I stand behind the window, holding a cup of coffee that has long gone cold.

Daniel’s car slowly backed out of the stone-paved driveway. I watched until it disappeared around the corner. Another business trip—his third this month. I couldn’t even remember the last time we had dinner together without a laptop or phone between us.

We used to love each other deeply. That much, I’m certain of. But love wears thin easier than people like to admit. It doesn’t always shatter from screaming matches. Sometimes, it simply fades—bit by bit—with each passing day that’s too quiet. Until one day, you wake up next to a stranger and realize that stranger is your husband.

I pushed that thought aside and walked out to the backyard. The roses needed pruning, and I needed something—anything—that made me feel like I still existed.

The sound of a truck engine broke the usual silence next door. I looked up. A silver pickup had pulled into the driveway of the house that had been empty for months. Someone new was moving in.

I tried not to be too curious, but it was hard. A man stepped out of the truck—tall, solid build, black fitted T-shirt clinging to his frame, jeans dusty with the road. I couldn’t see his face clearly from this distance, but there was something about the way he moved—calm, assured—that made me want to keep watching.

When he looked up and met my eyes across the fence, I startled slightly. He smiled—a small, easy smile, not forced, not polite. Real.

""Hi,"" he said, his voice low and warm.

""Hi… Welcome to the neighborhood,"" I replied, suddenly self-conscious, still holding my gardening shears.

""I'm Jake. Jake Nolan.""

""Emily. I live right here. Just next door.""

""Nice to meet you, Emily."" He gave a short nod, then turned and lifted a box into the house.

I stood there a moment longer, heart beating a little off rhythm. It wasn’t that he was extraordinarily handsome or movie-star charming. It was just… it had been so long since a man looked at me like I was *there*.

That night, I couldn’t focus on writing. My blog drafts—“10 Ways to Refresh Your Summer Kitchen,” “How to Care for Rose Bushes”—suddenly felt hollow.

I opened a bottle of wine—not because I needed it, but because I needed to feel something. Jazz played softly from the speaker on my desk, but all I could hear was the echo inside me.

Through the window, I caught sight of Jake up on the roof, adjusting what looked like a solar panel. His figure cast a long shadow against the shingles, hair tousled in the wind, but his movements calm and grounded.

I knew I should turn away. I’m a married woman. I’m not someone who daydreams like a teenager. But it was hard to look away from something that made me feel… alive.

I set the glass down and told myself that tomorrow, I’d be busier. That I was just tired. That it was nothing.

But when I lay in bed that night, I still carried with me the image of Jake Nolan’s eyes, his smile—a soft reminder that sometimes, a single glance is all it takes to wake a sleeping soul.",1,1755012470.0,CheatersConfronted,0,1.0,False
1mobt48,https://www.reddit.com/r/shopify/comments/1mobt48/shopify_theme_bug_crawlers_see_sold_out_on_every/,Shopify Theme Bug: Crawlers See ‘Sold Out’ on Every Product,"*I recently found and reported a bug in a Shopify theme that could be silently hurting store visibility and sales. The bug has now been inspected by Shopify and the report ticket is closed, so I can share the details.*

**🔍 What’s the bug?**  
**Some themes render the “Sold out” badge in the HTML of all products whenever show\_badges is true, even if the product is actually in stock.**

**Humans won’t see this because it’s hidden with CSS. But bots, crawlers, and AI tools (like ChatGPT, Bing Copilot, or Google SGE) will see it and may interpret your product as out of stock.** 

**This can lead to:**  
❌ Search engines show “Out of stock” in snippets  
❌ AI shopping assistants skip your product  
❌ Affiliate or aggregator sites remove your listing

**💡 Quick test for your shop:**  
Ask ChatGPT:  
“*What is the availability of* \[your product URL\]?”  
If it says “Sold out” but you know it’s in stock, you’ve got the bug.

☠️🪲 **The buggy code** (in my Refresh theme's snippets/price.liquid:

{%- if show\_badges -%}  
<span class=""badge price\_\_badge-sale color-{{settings.sale\_badge\_color\_scheme }}"">  
{{ 'products.product.on\_sale' | t }}  
</span>  
<span class=""badge price\_\_badge-sold-out color-{{ settings.sold\_out\_badge\_color\_scheme }}"">  
{{ 'products.product.sold\_out' | t }}  
</span>  
{%- endif -%}

**❌ Why it's wrong:**  
*price\_\_badge-sold-out* is always output whenever show\_badges is true, regardless of stock status. So “Sold out” appears in your HTML for all products, even if hidden visually. Crawlers, AI bots, and even Google can still read it as “Out of stock”.

**✅ How I fixed it:**

I work in the UK for a medium sized company. Since I’ve worked here I’ve dealt with several traumatic experiences on the job and I’m interested to know what my employers should’ve offered to help me as it’s starting to affect me.

Around 4 years ago I dealt with seeing a homeless person get stabbed twice then had their friend try to fight me and another employee.

Around a year later I witnessed a car crash which resulted in a woman dying, I was close enough that I helped doctors extract her from the vehicle (it was near to a hospital) aswell as dealing with people in the other 4 vehicles. I then had to stay over as this was in another city.

Another year or so later I was returning to the office from my lunch break when I saw a man on a bridge being held by two older women and a man. I then tried to talk him down before resorting to pulling the man back over to the correct side of the railings and calming him down until the police could arrive. When returning to the office I was told to ‘get myself a coffee and take a minute in the canteen before continuing my work’.

Then in October last year I was driving on the motorway when I passed a smoking vehicle on the hard shoulder with a man being pulled from the car. Having some basic first aid experience I pulled over onto the hard shoulder to help. I delivered CPR to the non responsive man for several minutes before the car burst into flames and started to make ‘popping’ sounds. I then told the group we had to move further away from the vehicle. Around 30 seconds after we moved the car exploded and showered the area we were previously in with debris. Long story short an ambulance arrived where the man was hooked up to a defibrillator whilst doctors were flown from a nearby hospital to operate on him. I tried to console his family who were all present during this time. Unfortunately this man passed away. This occurred on the first day of a site visit. I called my manager to explain what happened after this event to which I was told again to “get myself a coffee and that ordinarily they’d tell me to come home” but I was urged to carry on.

Following these events I was not offered any support. Whilst I feel like I could carry on I’ve noticed many changes in my behaviour and mental attitude which are now effecting my day to day life and relationships. I’ve always been of the mindset to get on with things however I feel like I’ve been kicking the can down the road for too long and it’s now starting to affect me.

I guess I’m just looking for advice on where I stand with my rights and how to approach that conversation with my employer.

Thank you for any advice.",0,1755012265.0,LegalAdviceUK,1,0.5,False
1mobpul,https://www.reddit.com/r/EmploymentLaw/comments/1mobpul/fl_assistant_manager/,[FL] assistant manager,"I was terminated effective immediately on Sunday August 10th at 11:32 am. 
I was scheduled to work at 11 am. At 8:13 am and 8:16 am I missed two calls from the owner of the spa I work for. At 8:21 I received 2 calls from a number I didn’t know. I then received 3 more calls at 8:22 from the same number. I learned this number is the managers boyfriend’s phone number. Her phone is broken. 
I was text from the spa phone number at 8:42 am asking to come in early. 
At 8:47 I received a call from the spa phone number. Then twice more at 9:08 am. 

Then my partner who is my emergency contact was called at 9:10 am. She answered the phone. The manager announced herself and asked if she might be able to ask me to come in early. My partner said she wasn’t home and the call ended. She then called my partner once more at 9:27 am. 

My second emergency contact MY MOTHER was called at 9:27 am and 9:28 am. 

I then responded to the texts I had received saying “hi. I just woke up. I have a ton of missed calls is everything okay?” 
The manager responded with “hey I needed to c if you can come in sooner” 
Followed by a second text “like now if possible\n** (redacted as this is the other workers name) will be in around noon , shifts got mixed up I guess.” 
The person scheduled at 7:30 to open the spa did not show up. She then stated she got the schedule mixed up and would be in at noon. 

I responded to the text that I could be there by 10:30 I just opened my eyes and needed to shower. It was 9:30. The manager responded and said “can we make that 10 I didn’t have coffee at all just woke up n drove over here cuz no one else could be reached I’m not even supposed to be here. I figured you could use more hours considering” 

Last week I was scheduled 40 hours and my hours were cut to 20 because we “weren’t that busy and payroll is a disaster” 

I text back and said “that’s only 30 minutes, I’ll be there when I can” 

She (the manager) responded two more times 
“Exactly, I hadn’t gotten a chance to wake up either I literally opened my eyes got in the car & came here” 
“I am not supposed to have to work today so please sooner than 10:30 I’m very upset to even have to be in spa today” 

I got to work at 10:14. 
At 11:15 am I text the owner expressing to her that it was inappropriate that both of my emergency contacts were called twice just for me to come in when in fact it was not an emergency. 

At 11:32 she responded that she was terminating my employment effective immediately. 

I clocked out and left. I got half way home and turned around walked into the spa and asked the employee that the desk (the manager on duty who was also the scheduled employee at 7:30 that didn’t come in until 11 am) for my employee file. The reason for my request is because I have never been written up, never had any incidents, no coaching situations where I needed reprimand, nothing. So I felt my termination was unjust (wrongful) and a direct retaliation of the incident from earlier in the morning. The manager on duty provided me my employee file. 

I then received a phone call at 12:08 from the managers boyfriend’s phone number. The manager called me to tell me “you’re being fu(*ing retarded. She’s going to call the cops on you. That’s theft. That’s not your property dude. You’re going to go to jail” I then informed her I had not stolen anything and politely told her I don’t care call the police and hung up on her. 

At 1:12 pm I received a call from a number I didn’t recognize. I answered and was informed by the caller who they were. Officer **** with the local police department. I asked how I could help and he told me he received a call for a theft of property belonging to the spa I worked at. I informed him that I had not stolen anything and it was handed to me by the manager on duty. He then informed me if that was the case that he would be squashing this immediately. He informed me he would call me back. 

At 1:49 pm he called back to inform me that there in fact was not a theft. And applauded me for asking for the file politely. 


I have not heard anything since. But I do feel as though I have a case. 

Wrongful termination?
Retaliation for both the firing and police being called?
Breach of privacy for going in my personnel file to call emergency contacts? 
My hours being drastically cut from 40 to 20 without notice? 
Harassment with the repeated calls outside of my working hours? 

I’m just looking for advice as to what recourse I have.

And by outdoorsy, I mean I occasionally walk to the coffee shop instead of driving.

But this weekend I decided I was going to “explore the jungle.”
Translation: I hiked into a national park wearing a hat I bought purely because it made me look like Indiana Jones’ less successful cousin.

Everything was going great. Sun peeking through the leaves, birds chirping, me feeling like I was about to discover a lost temple and a chest full of cursed gold.

Then I saw it.

Sitting on a mossy branch, staring at me like I owed it money, was this tiny, squirrel-ish, rat-ish… thing. Imagine a mouse, but if a mouse had just gotten back from prison.

We locked eyes. I froze. It didn’t blink. My brain immediately started narrating like I was on National Geographic: “Here we see the wild explorer encountering a fearsome beast…”

Instead of doing the smart thing (leaving), I pulled out my notebook.
Yes. My notebook.
Because apparently I thought the thing I needed most in that moment was… field notes.

It chirped. Not in a cute way. In a “I’m calling my boys” kind of way.
And then — I swear on my Wi-Fi password — it laughed at me and vanished into the leaves.

For the next ten minutes I heard rustling above me, like it was following me. Judging me. Probably texting its jungle friends about the clueless dude in the hat.

Made it back to camp before dark, heart racing, feeling like I’d just survived some epic encounter… until I realized I had basically been bullied by a forest hamster.”",1,1755011791.0,Teddross_fanclub,0,1.0,False

They now text regularly and occasionally meet for coffee/lunch during the day. We've been dating officially since 2019 and I live abroad, but I'm visiting soon.

Recently, they had lunch and **she suggested all three of us have dinner together when I visit.** I've never met him, though I know their history: they dated unofficially 2017-2018 (she says she couldn't handle a label then, but they acted as a couple). We maintained contact while she was with him and started hooking up in 2018, leading to him cutting her off. They met for coffee after he apologized in 2024.

**I trust they haven't been physical since reconnecting.** However, I'm uncertain about the motivations behind the group dinner and how to approach this dynamic. I want to handle this constructively.

**Specifically seeking advice on:**

1. **Communication:** How to discuss my feelings about their friendship and this dinner idea with my girlfriend in a productive way? What questions might clarify her intentions?
2. **Navigating the Dinner:** How to approach this meet-up? What boundaries or expectations might be reasonable to discuss beforehand?
3. **Relationship Dynamics:** For those in LDRs or with partners maintaining ex friendships, what strategies help maintain security and trust? How can I assess if this dynamic is workable *for me*?
4. **Understanding Motivations:** Why might she propose this dinner? Why might he agree, knowing their history and my role in their past conflict?

**TLDR:** GF reconnected with ex after 4 years NC. They now have a daytime friendship. She wants me (long-distance partner visiting soon), her, and her ex to have dinner together.

I'm an educated professional artist trying to do the thing in Chicago. It's a fun career choice but comes with so many trials and tribulations! 

When not stressing over deadlines and proposals, I'm playing a game (video games, d&d, board and card games, really anything!), watching a movie (I love horror and comedy!), or taking long walks for the fun of it.

I'm looking for a friend (or two!) To shoot the shit over commonalities, or learn a completely new thing from you! Ideally, you'd be a person who has an eclectic sense of humor (I'm no stranger over having a conversation about absolutely nothing), has an open mind for the world and new experiences, and asks as many questions as I do. I'm fine with leading a conversation but please please don't let this turn into an interview 😅

Machine learning in 2024? It’s more than math and code. It’s the art of teaching computers to, well… create, crack puzzles, and even surprise us!

Imagine just a few years ago, algorithms were clunky rule-followers, doing what they were told and nothing more. Today?

* Algorithms detect sarcasm (well—mostly 🫣).
* Apps recommend music before you realize you’re in the mood.
* Medical models flag health risks *before* symptoms erupt.

We’re at a point where *collaboration* means people and intelligent machines swapping ideas like colleagues in a brainstorm. And I can’t help but get excited when I think about:

- New tools letting *anyone* build cool ML-powered hacks, no PhD required
- Communities sharing pre-trained models like recipes – “Hey, try this for perfect cat detection 🍰!”
- Open-source wonders driving creativity in every garage, basement, classroom, and coffee shop

But most electrifying? Machine learning is beginning to fuel not only our tools, but our *relationships* with technology itself. When an algorithm curates your news or enhances your grandma’s portrait or catches your typos in real time, it’s as if our devices are learning the humanity in us.

A few open questions that make me genuinely giddy to discuss:
- Where is the boundary between “assisted” and “autonomous,” and does it even matter if the results are magical?
- How can we make room for new voices and perspectives in the training, application, and critique of machine learning?
- Is the future going to be a giant feedback loop of humans learning from machines and vice versa?
- Or, my favorite: What quirky, surprising thing will ML do next—which *none* of us saw coming?

At the end of the day, machine learning isn’t just tech. It’s a new *language* for exploring creativity, empathy, and possibility.

What has surprised, delighted, or troubled *you* about machine learning lately? Are you imagining something wild, or using an everyday ML gem that makes you smile?

I have been on .05 estradiol patch (2x/week) and 100mg oral progesterone nightly. Before starting HRT, I tried Lexapro which did help with hot flashes but ultimately made me extremely anxious. I found a local provider (she's an NP) who has a small practice focused only on women's midlife issues after I struck out with regular doctors.

I think I initially felt ok with HRT. Hot flashes are still gone. But now, almost a year in, I think the progesterone is making me crazy and I've bleeding almost every day since mid-May. My provider and I have agreed to dial back the estradiol to .0375 patch and that has stopped the bleeding after only a week, but what about the progesterone? It seems like 30 min after taking that nightly pill I'm wired, wide awake, heart palpitations, chills (!), and sleep has plummeted. I'm so tired that I didn't even set up the coffee machine right this morning and I'm kind of afraid to drive. If I look back in my journal, my sleep the last few months hasn't been great but it's only since cutting back on the patch dose that the potential progesterone problem has become clear. I got an Ambien prescription for 10 doses back in April and every other week or so I have taken one, which has been a real life saver, but that has run out now and I don't know if it's healthy to seek a refill. I tried various supplements and nothing has really helped with the sleep problem. Magnesium glycinate made me feel like I was going to die, melatonin makes me so dizzy but doesn't not help w/sleep.

I actually ended up skipping the progesterone on Saturday evening just to see what would happen and by Sunday afternoon, the palpitations stopped, anxiety dissipated, my chest felt light, and I was able to get some sleep that night, but I didn't sleep last night except for 2 hours maybe.

Am I going nuts? Can anyone relate? What did you do to feel better? I know I can't take estradiol w/out the p since I still have a uterus so I'll have to decide something soon but I don't know what. Should I just stop all of this HRT and see what happens?  Another form of progesterone? Estradiol gel?

Ed to add: I have endometriosis but am symptom free after a very thorough excision surgery a few years ago - lots of spots removed as well as one ovary. My NP said that as long as we balanced the estrogen patch with progesterone it would be fine. ",2,1755011253.0,Perimenopause,3,1.0,False

Yesterday I told her I was going to drop her stuff off, trying to at least move through the pain of having her things at my place, but she said she was going to be at work till 5. she said it’s not a bad idea to just put things in her car when she gets off of work so it’s not awkward being in her space again.

She said she doesn’t want to label this as “fixing things”; or that we’re in a relationship again. It just hurts so bad and I dont know if I’m naive and being toyed with.

I told her if she ended up moving on to someone else I couldn’t continue being her friend. It sucks to say but I know I couldn’t look at her and not feel a sense of love.

# ""Roobaroo Café""

Most of my client meetings used to be in offices or nearby restaurants—convenient but full of problems: noise, bad seating, interruptions, and that awkward feeling of being overheard.

After trying a dozen places, I stumbled upon **Roobaroo Café** in Hyderabad… and wow. This place has something special. Over **80% of their customers are regulars**, which already says a lot.

**The vibe?**  
It’s *chill*. Guests of all ages spend over an hour here gossiping, working, reading, or just relaxing. Nobody’s rushing, nobody’s giving you side-eye for staying long. There’s natural light, greenery in the middle of the concrete jungle, and perfect indoor temperature that makes you want to brainstorm or just zone out.

The first time I went, I ordered a cappuccino while waiting for a client (safe choice, since cappuccino + mocha are Hyderabad’s cafe favorites). I wasn’t expecting much… until it arrived. The aroma, the art, and the artist barista Raja, handing it over with pride, as if trophy won!

We started talking, and here’s what I learned:

>

They call it the **#RoobarooExperience**—everything matters: the bean selection, roasting process, milk texture, the cup, the service, and even the way they *observe guests* to serve them better (yep, there’s a trade secret there).

I’m working on validating an idea before moving to development.  
It's a mobile app for travelers (and locals) to join or host casual, last-minute activities (coffee meetups, beach hangouts, sunset walks, game nights, parties, etc.).

Our main target is travelers who might be in a city for just a few days but still want to connect with like-minded people. We’re testing interest first via a basic landingsite ([SoloSquad.app](https://www.SoloSquad.app)) and social media, and we’ve been getting signups.

Now, I’m trying to nail down the monetization model before investing in development.  
This is what I've had in mind so far:

* Freemium Join 1 activity per week for free with a paid upgrade to unlock unlimited joins and hosting for a fixed pass (3-day, 7-day, or monthly)
* A credits system where people buy credits to host or join activities

The challenge is that many of our users might only be in town for a few days, so a monthly subscription will probably be unattractive, but I also don’t want to fragment the payment options too much.

  
What do you think is the most user-friendly yet profitable way to monetize this kind of app for short-term travelers? Also, if you’ve tested or have seen similar models, I’d love to hear what worked and what didn’t.

[**Original**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2nsy91/i_22m_suspect_something_between_my_girlfriend_22f/)

I'm really freaking out right now because if what I suspect is true, this living situation is about to get really complicated. Please tell me I'm just crazy. Sorry if this is long.

**Background**

We are two couples living together, we all attend the same university. The apartment was originally leased by my girlfriend of about 2 years (Alexis) [22F] and our mutual friend Brooke [22F]. The apartment is huge and expensive. There was originally supposed to be 3 girls living there but the last one backed out abruptly. They were planning on moving somewhere cheaper, but they had put a lot of work into the apartment and loved it so much they hated the idea of leaving. 

I offered to move in when my lease was up in May so we could split the rent and utilities 3 ways. I was sleeping over often anyways. Both girls were absolutely ecstatic about the idea. Shortly before I moved in Brooke started dating my best friend Derek. This was cool because now both couples got to hang out with their best friends and SOs all at once. It seemed perfect. Derek began sleeping over a lot and when his parents sold their house and left in October, he temporarily moved in. 

We haven't really pushed for him to find a new place because splitting everything four ways is helping all of us so much. But again, only Alexis and Brooke are on the lease. The apartment owner surprisingly does not mind as long as rent gets paid, because we are always quiet.

There are three incidents that made me think something was up. If it weren't for these combined incidents, I would never make an accusation like this because Alexis is such a sweet and shy girl and Derek has been a brother to me. They don't seem flirty, but as I mentioned before all four of us are very close friends so we spend a lot of time together.

**Incident 1**

MWF Brooke and I have early classes, so we're gone by 8am. Derek and Alexis start in the afternoon so it's not unusual for them to leave together, though they usually take separate cars. One of these days, I decided to wait for Alexis outside of her class so I could surprise her with lunch. I watched everyone shuffle out of the class, but Alexis wasn't with them. I texted her asking where she was and she replied ""Just got out of class, gonna go home to study"" I called her to see if I had just barely missed her or something and there was no response, which I considered weird because she had just texted me second ago. 

She didn't answer until much later, which is also unusual for her (she's one of those girls that's often on her phone). I ran into Brooke later in the day and she mentioned in passing that Derek had stayed home sick, she was going to bring him soup, blah blah. At the time, I didn't think much of it.

When I got home later that night I noticed Alexis' car was in the exact same spot. (She usually parks in guest parking because our unit only has 3 spaces, as a result her car moves a lot). I asked her if she'd gone to class and she got quiet before sheepishly admitting to skipping because she felt the professor sucked at explaining things, but she knows I hate when she skips classes (something that's gotten her grades in trouble before, but she recently started doing better). I kissed her and said I trusted her judgment. While I was doing the dishes she explained how she probably won't skip again because being bored alone in the house was the worst. 

I laughed and we went about our business. At night we went to bed and as I laid there drifting off, it hit me. She shouldn't have been alone because Derek was home sick - right? She was still up on her phone so I popped awake and asked her where Derek was today since Brooke had said he was home sick. She seemed startled by the question, but that may have been from me being half asleep to suddenly wide awake with a random question. She said he was here a bit in the morning but went to do errands or something, she wasn't sure. After the other incidents, I realized that the scattered way she answered this question seemed off, but that may just be my imagination.

**Incident 2**

I went to throw some stuff out in the kitchen garbage when I noticed a condom wrapper that was the exact same brand Alexis and I use. It wasn't super visible, sort of tucked behind a cereal box but the distinctive color caught my eye. Brooke and Derek always use a different brand (free from the university health center while ours are expensive Trojans). It was weird because we usually keep the wrappers in our respective room's garbage cans so they never appear in the kitchen. 

Furthermore, because of exams and general stress Alexis and I hadn't slept together in a few days. I didn't really dig around for a used condom or anything, I just went back to the room to check if any of ours were missing. I really couldn't tell, because we buy in bulk. My first thought was that Brooke and Derek had ran out and broke into our stash and I was upset that they hadn't even asked. Later that night I mentioned the condom wrapper to Alexis and her eyes got wide. When I mentioned my theory she got unusually distressed (she's always very calm) and went on a rant about them violating our privacy. 

I suggested we talk to them about it and she immediately shut the idea down and made me swear not to bring it up unless they did it again. She didn't want to have this awkward conversation, which was weird to me because we're all generally pretty open about sex given that we live together. Though it is possible that Alexis was being genuine because she's from a conservative small town and she doesn't talk about these things as much as we do.

**Incident 3**

Me and Derek are cool with the dudes in the apartment next to us, who are graduates from our university. We don't hang out or anything, but we have the kind of relationship where we make small talk about sports or whatever in the hall and are comfortable asking the other to keep it down without it being awkward. Last Monday (during our break) I was locking up when no one else was at the apartment, when I ran into one of the guys from next door. We talked football for a bit and then he mentioned that one of the couples in the apartment is really a fan of morning sex and that the walls were way too thin. 

I laughed because Alexis and I usually had sex weekend mornings when we had the house to ourselves (Brooke and Derek usually spend weekends at her parents house about an hour and a half away). The more I thought about it later in the day, the more I realized we hadn't been having morning sex in about a month, on the weekends it had been more towards the evening or not at all. Did he mean on weekdays?! My heart sort of dropped. I kind of want to ask him to elaborate but the conversation ended and I feel like I missed my chance. Plus its a weird thing to ask and I feel like I must be being paranoid.

So there you have it r/relationships. Am I crazy? Am I looking for signs that aren't there or is something up? And if so how do I proceed? I don't want to ask her just yet because 1) I don't want to come off as crazy and jealous if nothings up 2) If something is up, I don't want them to start hiding it better. I was thinking of dropping by one of those mornings they're alone together but I don't know how to time it right. If I drop by too early or late they might get more cautious.

TL;DR: Several ambiguous incidents have lead me to suspect my girlfriend and best friend may be sleeping together, but I don't know if I'm imagining things.

[**Update 1**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2o0l1n/update_i_22m_suspect_something_between_my/) - *2 days later*

The majority of you suggested that I speak to Brooke and/or attempt to walk in on the act. I decided on doing both.

Sunday night everyone was back in the apartment. I had every intention of speaking to Brooke about the neighbor's comment alone, but before I could she said something that completely threw my theory off. She told Derek to get to bed so he wouldn't be tired for work in the morning. What. I knew Derek has a job on campus, but he had always worked the same night shifts. Being as casual as possible, I inquired how long he'd been working mornings and when he started. 

He said he picked up the extra shifts a month ago and worked at 9. (I leave at 7:45 so it's possible for me not to have noticed that). I spent the rest of the night trying to figure out whether he was lying about that, whether still he had some mornings here at home, whether Alexis could be seeing someone other than Derek in the mornings (like some of you suggested) or (again) if I was just a paranoid loser. I went to bed feeling emotionally drained and confused.

The next morning I left for classes as usual and operated on autopilot. I alternated between thinking I'd run home to check on Alexis and thinking I had way too much work to run around based on a theory that I wasn't even sure about anymore. In the end, I walked out of my first class and straight to my car to go home. In a weird way, I sort of wish I hadn't.

When I got to the apartment Derek's car wasn't there, just Alexis'. I walked to the apartment with my heart pounding all sorts of crazy. I don't know what I was expecting. Outside the apartment door I could immediately here a guy's voice inside. I heard him talking and laughing and a soft feminine mumble replying and giggling back. I've been on this subreddit long enough to see all the different reactions people have to this situation. 

I never once contemplated what I'd do. I pressed my ear to the door and see if I could make out what they were saying, but I could only make out a word here and there. There was a lot of giggling. Then, I heard the sound of Alexis being tickled and shrieking. Maybe I should've waited more. In retrospect I wish I did, but I couldn't take it. As soon as I started fiddling with my keys, it was dead silence in there.

She was fucking Mark. I never mentioned Mark in the previous post but he's one the guys in the apartment next to us (not the one that tipped me off). He's the only one I never liked. Fucking know-it-all douchebag attitude. Always made inappropriate comments towards both girls. Never thought anything of it. As soon as I opened the door, they both gave me a deer-in-headlights look that removed any naiive doubt I may have retained that the situation was innocent. I was planning on yelling at them or demanded answers, but (and this is fucking embarrassing) my eyes began to well with tears. I didn't want them to see that shit. So I said ""Nice. Real fucking nice."" and bolted back to my car.

I heard Alexis yelling my name in the hallway and picked up the pace. I sort of expected her to be chasing me but by the time I got to the car there was no one following me. I drove to a park that's near the apartment and sat there in disbelief. My first thought, weirdly enough was How is my family going to take this? What the hell am I going to tell them? My family fucking loved Alexis. They joked about our wedding and regularly called her part of the family. Then I started thinking about living arrangements. Our finals end in about two weeks, there's no way I can handle moving now. I'm applying to an extremely competitive graduate program and I can't let anything get in the way of that. Definitely not this cheating bitch.

I'm writing this from a friend's house. I explained the situation, he explained it to his parents and they welcomed me to stay in their home. I'm going to have to go back home to get some clothes sometime. I'm planning on going during this lab period I know Alexis can't skip tomorrow. It took her an hour or so to start blowing up my phone, but once she did it didn't stop. She started off asking me to come home so she could explain. Before I even had the chance to respond she sent another one begging me to come back because she was having an anxiety attack, something I always help her through. Maybe I'm heartless, but all I could think was good, you earned it. 

There was a pause and then she sent ""I don't know why you get so jealous, we were just hanging out."" I waited. She sent ""Look, I know it looks super sketchy, believe me if I were you I'd think the same thing, but we didn't do anything. He needed advice on his girl problems. You have to believe me."" No, no I don't. Normally I would have gotten a weird sense of satisfaction watching a cheater scramble to cover their ass, but my stupid brain just kept replaying all these great times we had together and wondering if she was cheating then too. I want to know when this started, but at the same time I'm worried it's been going on for longer than the month I've suspected something.

I received a text later that night from a number I didn't recognize. It was the nice dude from next door. He said (paraphrasing because it was a long text) that he got my number from Derek. He was extremely sorry for what I was going through and that he would have told me sooner but he wasn't completely sure. He said he knew his friend was seeing a girl with a boyfriend, but didn't put it together until he learned the girl's name. As many of you suspected, the comment was him trying to tip me off. So yeah, I guess he's bro of the year.

I don't think Derek and Brooke know yet. I haven't texted them. I haven't found the words. I know it's going to turn our living arrangement and friendships upside down. I guess I should message them before Alexis paints a different picture. I wonder what the cool neighbor said when he asked for my number. I don't think he told them, the would have said something... Right? Unless they took her side. Then I've lost my girlfriend and friends.

Any advice on coping with something like this, especially from those who have been there before, please let me know. I don't have many friends to reach out to besides the guy I'm staying with. Alexis, Brooke and Derek were basically my family. Alexis and I had talked about spending our lives together. I have never been serious about a girl the way I was with her.

**EDIT:** I am seriously moved by the amount of support you guys are giving me here. Please keep them coming, I may not reply to all the comments but I've read each one on both posts. I'm going to tell Derek and Brooke soon. I'll try to do a follow up when I have some sort of plan.

[**Update 2**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2oi4im/update_2_i_22m_suspect_something_between_my/) - *7 days later*

You wonderful motherfuckers. Between the comments to both posts and my inbox I have an immense collection of personalized pep talks, which I am referring to whenever I feel down (admittedly, a lot these days). I got advice/stories from all sorts of people - married, single, old, young... Wow. I never thought the internet would bring me this level of support. I just want you guys to know that by just typing up some comments you have made a very real difference in someone's life. Gotta say it feels a little strange receiving 6 reddit gold and making it to r/bestof just for sharing the worst day of my life, haha.

I got a lot of messages urging me to join redpill. This experience has soured my view of Alexis. Not women in general.

I got some messages saying I write too well and this is obviously made up. I have two words for you: I wish.

A clarification on the last update: I wasn't clear about what I see when I walked in. They weren't literally fucking, they were just sitting on the couch with a deer-in-headlights look that was incredibly incriminating and they both went quiet. It was just obviously not a ""hey, guess who dropped by"" situation.

Anyways, onto the update. I've been extremely busy with the semester ending and I took the majority's advice to bury my head in work. I've spent a lot of time at the library because Alexis never goes there.

In the process of posting the last update I realized how dumb it was that I hadn't contacted Derek and Brooke with my side. I screen-shotted the text from the cool neighbor, Will. (Side note: all names have been changed except Mark because fuck you Mark). Within the minute Derek was blowing up my phone with calls and texts that made it very apparent he didn't know anything. At the same time Alexis was sending texts begging me to meet up with her. 

I was feeling miserable and sent back a single text to Derek saying I wasn't feeling up to talking, then put my phone away for the night. In the morning I got a text saying to meet him at my favorite restaurant for dinner and drinks on him, assuring me that no one would be there ""not even Brooke."" I haven't had any appetite since everything went down, but the offer meant a lot and I really did want to see him so I decided to go after classes.

I got to the restaurant first and I had my heart in my throat worrying that Alexis would somehow be there, but she wasn't. Derek came up to me and gave me a big hug and opened with ""Dude, what the fuck."" So here's where shit gets a bit crazy and dramatic. A lot of you suggested that Brooke might side with Alexis or had been covering up for her the whole time. 

I wasn't so sure, because while she is closer to Alexis, her and I have been friends for a bit longer. According to Derek, as soon as he told Brooke she was absolutely furious. In his words: ""I sort of wanted to bitch Alexis out but Brooke took care of that... and then some."" Remember how I said Alexis came from a conservative small town? Her parents had NO idea that we were living together and she constantly stressed that they couldn't know or they'd cut her off financially. They liked me enough to be polite, but they were constantly worried a relationship would distract her from school and didn't want her getting pregnant or whatever. 

Derek said that Brooke demanded Alexis pack her things and find a new place or she'd call up her parents and tell them everything. Derek told me that later that night Alexis was sitting in the living room hugging a sweater I'd left behind and wailing at the top of her lungs that her life was over when Brooke yelled from her bedroom ""Well maybe you shouldn't have fucked Mark then."" Imagining that moment was kind of funny. Brooke's always been a very no-nonsense girl with a hot temper, but I definitely didn't expect this. It was extremely touching that she took the cheating that seriously. During that dinner all my fears that I'd lost my friends were completely washed away and I was able to choke down a few pieces of sushi.

When we left dinner, Derek promised to let me know when Alexis was gone so I could move back in. I declined his offer, because 1) Even if she does move out everything in that apartment reminds me of her including Derek and Brooke 2) Alexis and Mark probably fucked in my room, so I really don't want to sleep in it 3) In the current emotional state I'm in I don't want to be third-wheeling a happy couple, even though I'm sure they'd be considerate. He understood my points but said to let him know if I changed my mind, because Brooke and Alexis' friendship seems to be pretty over.

This week has been pretty uneventful, but I keep having to dodge Alexis. Luckily, I'm in an undergraduate program that only has 60 students so we have a lot of our classes together. I asked two friends to keep an eye out for her after giving them a sparknotes of the story, and started showing up to class at the last minute. As far as I know, she only waited outside of one of my classes. I got a text saying ""Bitch has been spotted in front of (classroom). Waterworks in progress. Proceed with caution."" I ended up skipping the class, because I didn't know if she was going to leave and I really didn't want to risk it.

Later that night she sent me a really long Facebook message explaining everything from the beginning and it sort of made me sick to read, I contemplating not reading it but once I opened it I just had to. She said that he'd been flirty with her in the halls (as I mentioned before, he would say inappropriate shit to both girls) and she tried to be friendly back, but it must have come off as flirting because he kissed her mid-sentence one day. 

She said she felt guilty that she ""led him on"" and that guilt prevented her from shooting him down in future advances because she felt like it was her fault it happened and she has trouble saying no (???) She said they'd only slept together 3 times and she hated it, he had pushed her into it (""not rape, but..idk I never said yes either"") and she was going to end it during the conversation I walked in on. She said she understood if I needed some time and some space but that she'd do absolutely anything to ""make it right"" and would spend the rest of her life making it up to me by:

- Treating me like a king, I'd never have to cook, clean or do my laundry again

- Give me full access to her phone and passwords. She even suggested we install Life360 (an app that allows you to track someone's location through their phone) so I would know where she is at all times.

- Cut off all contact with Mark and all her male friends (just for good measure, I guess?)

- Makeup sex whenever I wanted

Yeah, that sounds like a healthy relationship - right? I didn't answer. I kind of wanted to keep her on Facebook and watch the shit show unfold (she was posting dramatic statuses and song lyrics about mistakes, forgiveness and some from ""our song"") but I know how I am, I don't want to compulsively check her page or go through old photos. So I blocked her. Derek sent me a text a few hours later saying ""She's crying and screaming about you blocking her LOL""

In happier news, the family I'm staying with is fantastic. I felt a little guilty about taking up their space, electricity, etc. so I offered to put down rent and pay for some bills (I am unemployed but my family gives me a decent allowance for rent and food) but they declined. The dad said ""First month's free. If you need more time here then we'll talk about it."" and winked. My friend was telling me that they have hosted his and his sister's troubled friends so it wasn't a big deal. Still, I'm unbelievably grateful.

As for Will, (awesome neighbor) I called him to thank him for everything. I wasn't up to inviting him for dinner just yet, but I will. He apologized profusely. He says he can't stand Mark, not just for what he did with Alexis but various other things that I won't go into. He told me that Mark has been unusually quiet the past few days and told another one of the guys that he had gotten dumped. Whatever. I don't want to think about it.

So that's really all I have for you guys. I'm still going to be friends with Derek and Brooke but I'm going to limit my contact with them because they remind me of Alexis so much. I sent Brooke a message thanking her for kicking Alexis out and she said she'd do it regardless of whether or not I move back in. She's going to give me a heads up on when Alexis is gone so I can get the rest of my things. 

In the mean time I'm spending a lot of time studying, applying to grad schools, and hanging out with the guy I'm living with. Earlier this week I posted onto my university's Facebook group searching for roommates for next semester and I already have a few replies. I'm going to wait until after finals to tell my parents about the situation because my mom asks a million questions about everything and I'm not in the mood to answer them.

Again, thank you thank you thank you for all the messages. I didn't not expect this level of attention and while it has made me a bit paranoid someone will recognize the story from the details - fuck it I needed the support.

I fucking love you guys.

TL;DR: Brooke is kicking Alexis out and Derek is still my buddy. I'm doing okay given the circumstances, and I'll hopefully be finding a new apartment next month.

[**Final Update**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2s8eir/update_3_i_22m_suspect_something_between_my/) - *45 days later*

Well, I really wasn't planning on updating but a lot of you have prodded for one and I do owe you guys after all the wonderful support I received.

Once finals ended (I did well given the circumstances), everything hit me like a ton of bricks. I mean, almost worse than the initial insult. I removed all my social media pictures with her, threw out stuff that reminded me of her, took our songs off my playlists, yadda yadda . We've been inseparable since we met so this was over two years of accumulated memories. Long story short, it was very hard but I had an urge to get it all done before the new year. That whole cliche new year, new me thing... I guess. I don't know.

Anyways one particular redditor sent me a message about how Alexis might be driven to suicide now that she's lost everything (her closest friends, her boyfriend and her apartment). I know that seems like an overdramatic prediction, but I couldn't get it out of my mind after reading it. What Alexis did was absolutely freaking terrible, but I felt like a final conversation might give me better closure and maybe help her understand that its completely over and get her to move on. So I planned to meet with her before everyone went home for break. A lot of you were big on the icing her out, so I'm genuinely sorry to disappoint but I had to do this for me.

I sent Alexis ""If you want to talk, we can meet up somewhere... But there's no way we can be together after what happened so please don't ask, okay?"" She responded almost immediately asking when and where. We arranged to met at an off campus coffee place. When I got there she was already at a table and got up to hug me. I waved her away and she jerked back like a puppy that had been kicked. I felt shitty immediately, but I wanted to get it over with. We made some stupid small talk, she asked how I'd been, how were finals, etc. But I sort of interrupted it. 

I asked her if she had been unhappy with our relationship. Her eyes got real wide and she said ""No no no.."" a bunch off times and got quiet. So I asked her why if she wasn't unhappy. Basically she retold the story about having trouble saying no and him being so pushy. I stopped her and asked her to cut the BS and just take responsibility. That maybe it excused her actions up until he ""kissed her midsentence"" but sex three times?! Yeah.. no. She looked down, shrugged and muttered ""You're right, I know."" At this point she started tearing up and said she was so sorry, that I'd never understand how sorry she was. 

Then she asked if there was any chance we could be together again, which I was kind of expecting even though I told her not to. I just shook my head. I told her she could still live with Derek and Brooke if she wanted to, but she declined and told me she already had plans to move in with another girl friend of hers. From here on out the conversation went in circles with her trying to explain away her actions with her difficulty turning down guys due to her fear of being seen as a frigid bitch and me trying to get her to admit that excuse was garbage. 

I don't know why, I just really needed her to stop using that crutch and admit she had ruined a perfectly good relationship with a very real future all on her own. But she just wouldn't. She was always stubborn. Finally, I let it go and we parted ways somewhat amicably. As I was leaving she grabbed my hand and parted her lips to say something but ended up shaking her head and letting go. 

The conversation made me feel worse than I had before at first, but ultimately it really made me see that she was never the kind of person I wanted to be with even without the cheating. She never took responsibility for anything (failed classes were because the professor was incompetent, not finding a job/internship was bad luck and not her lack of effort, etc.). I just never really thought about it too hard. I think I was still in the honeymoon stage or something (something = I'm an idiot sometimes).

So at this point I leave the coffee place and ask Derek to hang out. I ended up going to the apartment and although Brooke was there she mostly stayed in her room. We drank some beers and played some video games, it really cheered me up. We also talked a bit about everything that happened. He admitted that they hadn't been able to find a third roommate (aside from complete strangers they'd rather not move in) and asked me again to stay with them. 

I could tell he really wanted me to and I felt guilty about them being stuck with the lease so I accepted. I told them I needed to wait until Alexis took all her things though. The furniture is hers from before I even moved in and I still don't want to sleep in that bed. Also, Brooke apologized for getting so involved in the situation and yelling at Alexis. Apparently her stepdad had cheated on her mom and it's a sore subject for her. I told her I genuinely didn't mind and she was welcome to do it again if the mood struck her.

I also bought Will some food and drinks at a great place near campus. A lot of you wanted to know the other shit Mark had done that had Will so pissed off. Apparently he had to be harassed to pay rent, claimed he couldn't contribute to any of the household expenses (like dish soap, lightbulbs, cleaning supplies), and regularly came in yelling and laughing at odd hours and agreeing to keep it down then carrying on at the same volume. The standard douchebag roommate crap, really. Will is a really cool guy, we talked a lot about the situation with Alexis but also about school and sports. It was actually pretty fun.

I eventually did tell my folks about the situation and, as expected, my mom bombarded me with a thousand questions and cried a lot. So that was fun. Going home made me feel a little better but my older brother got engaged on Christmas Eve and given the recent circumstances I wasn't as excited for him as I should have been, which made me feel like a shitty sibling. Plus it's all my family can talk about now and I'm just not in the mood.

Life isn't perfect now, but I'm doing better. Alexis moved her shit out and I bought a secondhand bed and dresser off another student. I had my first round of classes last week and although I'm going to sound like a total nerd - the courses are really cool, hands on and the professors are incredibly cool people. Derek and Brooke have been really supportive and don't make me feel like a third wheel at all. I saw Mark in the hallway once and he totally ignored me and I ignored him, but the urge to punch him in the face was very real. I guess that's something that will go away over time. I almost wanted to call him out on the whole thing but with the kind of person Will had described, the conversation would have gotten me nowhere and probably pissed me off more.

Sorry this update isn't as exciting as the previous ones. Thank you for your love and support Reddit. It really, really helped me through such a bad time.

TL;DR: Alexis made more excuses and then moved out. I moved back in. My friends are great and I'm on the path to recovering from the whole ordeal.

I’ll be visiting Tokyo for the second time this November and staying near Ikebukuro Station. I’m planning to head to Yokohama in the late afternoon (around 3–4 PM), but I’m wondering if it’s realistic to fit in a trip to Kawagoe earlier in the day?

I’m not big on shrines, museums or similar stuff. I mostly enjoy walking around, trying street food, popping into coffee places, and just soaking up the atmosphere. So I’m not aiming to check off a bunch of time-consuming sights - just looking to wander, eat, and enjoy the vibe.

From the couch it looks doable, but I’d love to hear from someone with firsthand experience. Is this too much for one day, or does it sound reasonable?

A Complete Bahrain Company Formation Guide,"How Much Does It Cost to Register a Company in Bahrain in 2025? A Complete Bahrain Company Formation Guide\
Personal Experience: My First Steps in Bahrain’s Business Hubs\
Bahrain has an energy that’s hard to describe until you’ve felt it yourself. I still remember my first business meeting inside the glass-walled towers of Bahrain Financial Harbour. The view of the turquoise Gulf contrasted sharply with the bustling negotiations happening around a majlis-style table (yes, with a complimentary cup of Arabic coffee—never refuse it, even if you’ve had three already!). Later that week, I set up my Sijilat appointment in the Seef District, then caught up with a local consultant at a rooftop café near Bahrain Bay—I’ll always recommend those as best spots for early-morning strategy sessions.\
\
Registering a company in Bahrain blends old-world courtesy with new-world efficiency—you see it most on the mosaic floors of the Diplomatic Area’s government buildings, where tradition and fintech startups quietly co-exist.\
\
The 2025 Bahrain Business Environment: Growth, Confidence, and Opportunity\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting. show foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows growing by 14% year-on-year, with the Economic Development Board (EDB) projecting a robust 4.3% GDP growth this year. Forbes Business Forbes Business – Bahrain Economic Insights named Bahrain as the Gulf’s “most agile market for SME founders,” highlighting its advanced digital infrastructure and notably quick setup times compared to the UAE or Saudi Arabia.\
Why? Two primary reasons: competitive business costs and the Kingdom’s reputation for regulatory transparency. The government, led by the MOICT and EDB, rolled out a new digital registration and compliance system in January 2025. This system slashed average processing times by nearly 30%—one of those rare policy shifts that feels like it was designed by people who’ve actually run a business here.\

Understanding Bahrain Company Formation: Structures, Ownership, and Process\
Choosing the Right Structure: SPC, WLL, and More\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration. – Ideal for solo entrepreneurs, 100% ownership possible.\
- With Limited Liability (WLL) – For small teams, can have up to 50 shareholders.\
- Branch Office of a Foreign Company – Popular for multinationals seeking market entry.\
- Public Shareholding Company (BSC) – For large ventures requiring public funds.\
- Free Zone Company – Tailored for companies that want no-corporate-tax, repatriation advantages (See Free Zone Benefits).\
- Commercial Registration** – This is your company’s legal identity; every structure starts here (More on CR).\
Pro tip: For international founders, Bahrain’s SPC and WLL structures offer up to 99% foreign ownership (see official guidance), easily outpacing neighboring Gulf states. Compare all entity types here.\
\
Local tip: During Ramadan, government hours are reduced; always schedule your Sijilat visits for early mornings, and bring paper copies and digital files—MOICT often wants both.\
\
Ownership Options for Foreign Entrepreneurs\
It always surprises newcomers that Bahrain genuinely encourages global investment. Since the 2023 Foreign Ownership Law update, most sectors now allow 100% foreign ownership (see up-to-date breakdown of allowed activities). There are a few restricted areas (like oil and security), but for tech startups, consultancies, trading, and fintech? You’re in luck.\
Off-topic, but highly relevant: a friend of mine once picked a Bahraini partner because “everyone said you needed one.” Six months later, they realized they could’ve avoided unnecessary complexity in their CR and cap table. Always check the latest regulations or consult with a credible local expert.\
How Much Does It Cost to Register a Company in Bahrain in 2025?\
Breaking Down the Costs: Real Numbers & Budgeting\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs. MOICT fee schedule and digital Sijilat platform charges:*\
\
Application & Registration (Sijilat platform): BHD 50 – BHD 150 (varies by entity type)\
Commercial Registration (CR) certificate: BHD 25 – BHD 200 (based on business activity)\
Annual CR renewal: BHD 50 – BHD 100\
Municipality License: BHD 30 – BHD 100 (office type/location)\
Name Reservation: BHD 20\
Memorandum of Association drafting & notarization: BHD 30 – BHD 60\
\
Practical Budget Ranges\
\
Typical SPC/WLL setup (single founder, digital filings): BHD 175 – BHD 350 (all government fees included)\
Legal & consultant fees (optional, but recommended for non-Arabic speakers): BHD 300 – BHD 800\
Virtual office or desk rental for CR address: BHD 30 – BHD 120/month (Seef and Bahrain Bay are efficient, cost-effective zones)\
Free Zone setup: BHD 600 – BHD 900 (sometimes higher—see Keylink’s detailed breakdown)\
\
Insider tip: Many entrepreneurs forget to budget for the LMRA labor card processing (BHD 120 per expatriate employee) and the Tamkeen fee (BHD 20 per year, per employee)—these sneak up on you fast during early hiring.\
Comparison With UAE and Saudi Arabia\
Surprisingly, Bahrain’s company formation costs are 30-40% lower than in Dubai or Riyadh for SPC and WLL structures. The Sijilat system is more transparent and—this matters—queues at MOICT are shorter, especially in Seef or Diplomatic Area offices on Wednesdays.\
Step-by-Step Process: How to Register Your Bahrain Company\
1. Business Name Reservation\
\
Reserve via Sijilat portal. Propose three names—one always gets rejected.\
Pay BHD 20 by card or benefit pay.\
\
2. Application Submission (Sijilat)\
\
Complete online form with all shareholder and director details.\
Attach scanned passport copies, proof of address, NOC if required.\
\
3. Drafting & Notarizing the Memorandum (MOA)\
\
Prepare your MOA. Use a bilingual template.\
Notarize at the Notary Public in the Diplomatic Area (early mornings are fastest; I once waited three hours during Eid week—rookie mistake).\
\
4. Municipality Office Approval\
\
Show lease or office agreement; virtual offices accepted in most commercial zones (Seef, Bahrain Bay, Juffair).\
Get the Municipality License—no shortcuts here.\
\
5. Pay Government Fees and Receive CR\
\
Fees paid electronically, instant receipt.\
CR issued within 1-3 days—faster for digital submissions.\
\
6. Employee LMRA Labor Cards and Tamkeen Registration\
\
Apply immediately if hiring expatriates.\
Labor cards: BHD 120 each; Tamkeen: BHD 20/employee/year.\
\
7. Bank Account Opening\
\
Required: CR, MOA, lease, shareholder documents.\
Banks in Bahrain Bay offer English-speaking business advisors—skip Diplomatic Area branches for shorter queues.\
\
More on the formation process from personal experience: Bahrain company formation process guide.\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation.. Early mornings in Seef District save you hours.\
- Document prep: Scan all originals into a single PDF before going—clerks love this.\
- Leverage digital: Use e-notarization if available—launched February 2025.\
- Network: Drop by a majlis-style café nearby; locals often share “off the record” advice on pending rule tweaks.\
Regulatory Changes in 2025: What’s New and What Matters\
Importantly, a key regulatory change implemented March 2025 by MOICT: the new Real Beneficiary Disclosure Law. All new companies must now file a digital UBO (Ultimate Beneficial Owner) form alongside the CR application. Penalties for delay: BHD 250 minimum—don’t forget this step, as many did in Q1 and got stuck in compliance reviews. Full regulation details here from Bahrain Official Site.\
My workaround: Prepare the UBO information ahead, use the new Sijilat “Fast Track” upload. Saved me at least a week of back-and-forth.\
Ongoing Compliance and Bookkeeping\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation.\
- Monthly VAT filings (where applicable)\
- Basic accounting/bookkeeping—even if revenue is small (affordable outsourced options are available)\
- Labor Market Regulatory Authority (LMRA) updates** for all expatriate staff\
Many founders forget the annual Tamkeen renewal; it’s auto-reminded by Sijilat, but don’t rely on email notifications alone!\
Challenges and Solutions: How I Navigated Bahrain’s Company Formation Maze\
I made my biggest mistake by assuming digital processes would always be faster. During one rush to set up a client’s CR in the Diplomatic Area branch, I discovered that traditional paper forms still rule for certain license amendments—especially in sectors like construction and healthcare. Solution? Call ahead and ask which forms are accepted per sector, and bring a pre-filled hard copy.\
\
And here’s a lesser-known workaround: local business customs dictate that offering coffee (even to government clerks!) can smooth minor friction points—a small gesture, but respected everywhere.\
\
Choosing Office Locations: Smart Picks in 2025\
If you want cost savings and maximum flexibility, look for virtual desk providers in Seef District or Bahrain Bay. Their addresses are fully MOICT-compliant, and these districts offer excellent public transport, easy parking, and fast access to government centers. Avoid the more expensive Diplomatic Area unless you absolutely need to impress blue-chip clients.\
I recommend Keylink Bahrain for up-to-date advice and reliable office solutions—they’ve helped both my clients and me cut setup time from weeks to days.\
Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them\
\
Using old forms or outdated digital links—always use the latest Sijilat portal version.\
Not checking sector-specific restrictions before applying for 100% foreign ownership.\
Missing the UBO declaration deadline (especially common in Q2 2025).\
Underestimating translation needs—MOICT prefers dual-language filings for most documents.\
\
The best prevention? Build a direct WhatsApp connection with your formation consultant and keep digital and hard copies of every submission. Communication is king here—Bahraini business culture favors quick, relationship-based updates.\
Bahrain Culture Tangent: How Coffee and Conversations Propel Your Application\
Did you know that “business hours” in Bahrain really mean something different during Ramadan? Official times may be shorter, but business actually picks up after sunset. I once had a CR meeting in Juffair at 9 PM over dates and gahwa, which ultimately moved my application to the top of the review pile. The lesson: adaptability and cultural awareness are not just pleasant—they’re strategic.\
Frequently Asked Questions About Bahrain Company Formation Costs\
1. What is the minimum capital required to start a company in Bahrain?\
Most setups—particularly SPCs and WLLs—do not require minimum paid-up capital for consulting, IT, or service businesses. Some sectors (e.g., finance, insurance) demand specific capital per MOICT guidelines. See current sector-by-sector capital rules.\
2. Can foreigners truly own 100% of their company in Bahrain?\
Yes! As of 2025, almost all sectors allow 100% foreign ownership (with rare exceptions). Always check your specific activity via the updated eligibility tool here or review the law’s text here.\
3. Is it better to set up a company in a Bahrain Free Zone?\
If you want zero tax and streamlined foreign ownership with easier bank onboarding, free zones like Bahrain Logistics Zone or Bahrain International Investment Park are excellent (read full benefits breakdown). Just be prepared for higher upfront setup costs—typically BHD 600+.\
4. What are the recurring annual costs?\
Beyond your initial registration, budget for:\
- CR renewal: BHD 50–100\
- Annual office/virtual address: BHD 350–600\
- Professional accounting/bookkeeping: BHD 350+ per year (outsourcing options)\
- LMRA and Tamkeen fees for employees\
5. How long does company registration take in Bahrain?\
The digital Sijilat portal means typical registrations finish in 2–7 days (faster with expert help). Avoid late-week submissions—processing drops after Thursday afternoon. See optimized process suggestions.\

1mob4ln,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeLoadout/comments/1mob4ln/why_is_the_best_electric_kettle_from_peach_street/,Why is the best electric kettle from Peach Street worth the hype?,"Boiling water may seem like such a mundane task, but once I got my hands on the Peach Street PE-1302 Electric Kettle, it felt anything but ordinary. This sleek, glass water boiler has been a steady companion in my kitchen for the past few weeks, and it has undoubtedly shaken up my tea-making routine. As someone who needs her caffeine kick every morning and maybe a soothing chamomile tea before bed, I’ve been putting this appliance to the test multiple times daily. But let's dive into the nitty-gritty.

**Impressive Design with Modern Touches**  
The first thing I noticed about this electric kettle is its premium look. Constructed with brilliantly clear borosilicate glass and brushed 304 stainless steel, the kettle adds a unique charm to any countertop. It also feels much sturdier than some plastic kettles I've used in the past. The blue LED light that illuminates as the water boils isn’t just functional; it adds an oddly calming yet stylish glow to the boiling process. Plus, with its compact dimensions at 7""L x 7""W x 9""H, it doesn’t hog too much counter space, which is a bonus in my somewhat crowded kitchen.

**Ease of Use for Tea and Coffee Addicts Like Me**  
Thanks to its ergonomic design, handling and pouring with this kettle has been hassle-free. I particularly like the convenient one-touch button that opens the lid. It’s oddly satisfying every time I press it! And the wide mouth? A dream for someone like me who’s always splashing water everywhere when refilling or attempting to clean hard-to-reach spots. Additionally, the built-in mesh filter is a lovely touch, especially when I’m feeling fancy and decide to drop some fruit slices or tea bags directly into the kettle.  

[Check Peach Street PE-1302 price on Amazon.](https://windtoons.com/p/b0b2q7n54s/)

**Fast and Reliable Heating Performance**  
Let’s talk speed—this kettle heats water like it’s late for work. With its 1500 watts of power and OTTER controller, water seems to rush to a boil in what feels like seconds. I mean, is there anything more satisfying than impatiently waiting for tea, only to discover the kettle is already finished? On average, it took under four minutes for me to heat a full pot of water, perfect for when I need my coffee fix during rushed mornings. It’s also been fantastic for those impromptu late-night ramen cravings.

**Advantages**  
- Glass and stainless steel construction ensures durability and charm.  
- Rapid boiling capability saves time.  
- Safe operation with auto shut-off and cool-touch handle.  
- Illuminated blue LED provides a stylish and functional touch.  
- Wide mouth makes cleaning and refilling a breeze.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Like most glass kettles, it tends to show water spots if not cleaned consistently.  
- The auto shut-off can sometimes be so quick that it feels overly cautious, especially when boiling less water.  
- Cord storage under the base is fine, but honestly, it feels a bit tight for thicker power cords.  

**Safety Features You Can Trust**  
Any of us who’ve boiled water while careening through a to-do list know how easily distractions happen. Thankfully, this kettle’s auto-shutoff feature is a lifesaver. No more panicking about whether I left the water boiling when leaving the house—or realizing much later that I wasted electricity (and likely burned out an appliance). The concealed heating element is another win, ensuring that no strange toxins leach into the water. The cool-touch handle has also, on more than one occasion, saved my hands from a potential burn.

**Competing Products**  
In comparison to other electric kettles like the Cuisinart PerfecTemp or the Hamilton Beach Glass Kettle, this one holds its ground quite well. While the Peach Street model lacks temperature control options that some competitors offer, it makes up for that with faster boil times and an incredibly attractive design. Also, where certain competitors rely heavily on plastic components, this model’s reinforced glass and stainless steel construction feel leagues ahead in terms of durability and hygiene. If you’re a purist who just needs an efficient boiler, this will serve you better for a lower price point.

**Value for Money**  
For an electric kettle that looks this good, boils this quickly, and has thoughtful features like a mesh filter and LED lighting, I’d say it’s a smart investment. It may not be loaded with premium bells and whistles, but it's certainly got everything a regular user like me could ask for while remaining budget-friendly. The lack of advanced settings might deter hardcore enthusiasts, but for an everyday tea or coffee drinker, it’s more than adequate.

*New Casablanca orbit, Rovajärvi Asteroid Station*

Captain Drysel of the Foreign Terran Legion sat in his commander's office and resisted the urge to look up. He'd known this was coming, so he'd brought Lead Engineer Flobari with him. Despite being Hurdop-born, Flobari was quite content to be led by a Vilantian, so long as that Vilantian stayed out of the engineering space. The two of them were here to have a further discussion with Colonel Selanne about their most recent job. The Colonel was somewhat casually dressed, with the main informality being that her hair was held back in a ponytail by a utilitarian blue elastic band. Her scent was overall one of controlled disappointment.

""Captain. Warrant Officer. One of you needs to begin speaking, or I will.""

Drysel spoke first. ""The fault was mine Colonel. I failed to confirm that the capacitor reserves were intact after the firing sequence, causing our engines output to be reduced by twenty-seven percent.""

The colonel looked between the two. ""The only reason this is acceptable is that there were no friendly casualties. You were both *selected* for this. Chosen. Hired. And yet after receiving training, a good ship with a good company, we still have Bob and Doug mocking you upon your return. That reflects poorly on not just the Legion, but this company as a whole."" She steepled her hands together, drawing a deep breath. ""Now, can the two of you explain why Major Gryzzk is able to do exceptional things with a jumped-up cargo vessel?""

Flobari cleared his throat. ""Ma'am, I believe you may have the incorrect presumption with respect to the *Twilight Rose*. Before the refit, it was a Warfreighter class vessel. A few generations out of date but her armaments and power plant were enough to take to battle with confidence. During the refit, the Vilantian inefficiencies were scrubbed, allowing them to take full advantage of the ship capabilities. My observation of the training exercises with them showed their performance gradient twenty-seven percent above a standard Warfreighter. With the variable armaments it has, it is more than equal to any three Vilantian pre-war ships. Even when heavily outnumbered, she's shown her color admirably."" His eyes flicked around the room. ""The solution becomes obvious - we need to acquire a Warfreighter or if possible something newer and refit it similarly.""

""Expand."" Colonel Selanne fixed her gaze on the engineer.

""The Rose has advantages we do not possess. Based on what I've heard at Sparrows, their entire ship is variable-grav capable. The *Gripenwaldt* is a fine ship - for a single-species crew. With the gravity set at Terran standard, we - the doctor could provide a full report, but we need higher gravity to operate effectively. There are many other improvements, but I believe based on the freely available data we could reduce the refit time to as little as ten days.""

""Is there any way to reduce the time?""

""Not without placing a call to Skunkworks.""

There was a nod from the Colonel. ""Do it. And while Warrant Officer Flobari is making calls, Captain Drysel should be making contact with his friends on Vilantia and asking what they will take in trade for a Vilantian Warfreighter. Something newer would not go amiss.""

The two junior officers exchanged glances. Finally Drysel spoke somewhat hesitantly.

""Colonel, would it be possible to transfer Teemu as well? I have ah, grown fond of him.""

""If he agrees, then yes.""

""Then if the Colonel will excuse us, we need to build a worthy ship for our AI.""

""What will you name this worthy ship?""

""If it pleases the colonel, we would call her the *Freelord's Gyrfalcon*.""

The colonel cocked her head slightly. ""They are calling you that now, aren't they. Earn the name, Captain. Dismissed.""

The two junior officers looked at each other as they walked to the their ship's berth. ""Freelord, how precisely are we going to do this? We're never going to be the *Twilight Rose*.""

Drysel took a long breath. ""No. And therein lies the problem and it's solution; we've been trying to be what we're not. We have been following a trail laid down by others for too long. First our ancestors, and now Freelord Gryzzk. We should be what *we* are.""

""Perhaps we should be what we are after we have a ship as fine as he has.""

""Of course. To work, then.""

*Terran Foreign Legion Ship* Twilight Rose

Gryzzk looked across the conference room table at his senior engineers, who were all looking exhausted under various bandages and splints. They'd spent the last fourteen hours catching naps when they fell over at their station, which had Gryzzk worried - the engineering section wasn't alone in their overwork. Every section that wasn't ship-critical had been pressed to work for the ship-critical sections, grabbing tools and performing minor repairs that only required a checklist. ""Chief Tucker, tell me this is some mad practical joke.""

""Not even a little. Report's all there. When their driver rammed us, the outer coatings on both ships got shredded and the hulls cold-welded together. We got the hatch dogged and guarded just in case anyone else decides to bring us a fruit basket, but the only way we're getting unstuck is at a dock. If we go with just our engines that'll be eighteen hours. At best. We light the other ship engines up, we get there in three hours. Figure two hours to make sure they don't have any surprises in the engine compartment for us and get a rig together. Alternatively, we could call for tow - Hurdop control says they'd have a ship free in about a week.""

""How much control will we have?""

""That's a pilot question. Hoban's warming the chair right now, Rosie might be able to handle some of it, but frankly Maje, her cycles are taxed right now.""

""I cannot disagree."" Gryzzk tapped his tablet. ""Doctor Cottle, please?""

A pair of voices answered in unison. ""Go for Cottle.""

""Doctors, your prognosis with respect to Corporal Miroka?"" Gryzzk shook his head at himself for not specifying.

The former Mrs Cottle took over. ""Major, she has a mild concussion in addition to the expected trauma from getting thrown against her harness, but she is conscious.""

""Thank you doctors."" Gryzzk paused for a moment before opening a new channel. ""Captain Robau. Get a detail of whoever is least injured; I want the *Svitre's Vengeance* swept fully. Anything more explosive than a Hurdop Sprout is to be disarmed. Pay special attention to the engine compartment - I want everyone going to engineering in full biosuit. I would like to start hearing reports that ship sections are clear in fifteen minutes.""

""We're on it Major."" Robau was clipped and professional as they disconnected.

""Now then if there's nothing further - engineering, stand yourselves down for a two hour nap. You're going to need it.""

It was a testament to how hard they'd been working that the entire group simply put their heads down on the table and started snoring.

Gryzzk left the conference room as silently as he could. As he exited, he almost ran into O'Brien, who was looking quite neutral - but her scent was something else entirely; it was a mix of harsh emotions that was probably in no small part due to the fact that her forearm was in a pressure cast.

""Sir, if I could have a moment of your time?""

Gryzzk nodded, leading her to his quarters. He sat on his bed, while O'Brien took his chair and settled in. She took a breath and began speaking quietly to ensure her words didn't carry, despite the fact that the room was theoretically secure.

""Major, that bloody stunt with Delia shouldn't have happened. She can wave all the lawyers in the galaxy at you and invoke every iron-clad clause in every contract written since Hammurabi but out here in black, *you* are in charge. If she would have died it's *our* asses standing on the dock, and even if we have all the legal justification ever crafted her soul would not rest lightly on your conscience. Be grateful you have a smart wife who's a fine shot."" She paused to fiddle at her cast for a moment before she met his eyes coolly. ""Would you have allowed wee Gro'zel on that ship?""

Gryzzk shook his head, accepting the verbal beating. ""No, she's a child.""

""Sometimes there's no difference between a client and a child. They don't know what they don't know, and what they don't know is everything that keeps us alive and well. Delia sees our world once a year to try and convince Reilly that a gilded cage is a fine life when you get used to it. With that in mind, what are we going to do the next time our clients decide to piss on the electric fence?""

""Prevent it.""

O'Brien nodded. ""By any means necessary. Turn her slim ass over your knee and spank it if you have to, but do not let that bint put herself in danger.""

Gryzzk looked around, avoiding the sergeant major's gaze. Just her scent of anger and relief was bad enough that this was not a conversation that Gryzzk would forget any time soon. ""Understood. If there's nothing else?""

O'Brien shook her head. ""No. Just double check your tea to make sure nobody puts any more stupid-pills in it. ""

As the door closed, Gryzzk laid down on his bed heavily and stared at the ceiling. He knew he should be doing other things, but at the same time he couldn't wipe what he'd seen from his mind. It was time to begin making amends with several individuals.

""XO - what is the current location and status of Delia?""

Rosie's voice was distant, as if some of the cycles normally dedicated to her personality had been re-allocated to other tasks. ""She is currently in her quarters hugging Gro'zel and having a bit of a moment. Charles is talking her down with some sort of song, but I do not think she'll be ready to talk any time soon."" There was a pause. ""Sergeant Reilly is currently assisting in medical, and Corporal Kiole is acting as a runner for engineering.""

""I should...I should be doing something. Suggestions, XO?""

""Recommend briefing and preparation tasks with respect to transit. While I am qualified for ship flight operations, it would be better to have biologicals flying in this time.""

""Understood. As you were, XO."" With that Gryzzk stood, ensured he was at least marginally presentable and stepped out to the bridge.

""Captain Hoban, set the ship to station-keeping and walk with me.""

Hoban nodded, tapping a few controls before standing. Miroka was at the communications station attempting to explain that they would need a large berth at the drydock, while Larion was continually examining his sensor suite with an intensity that suggested he'd just discovered Earl Grey tea. O'Brien and Laroy were going over the weapons systems and frowning in turn as they each discovered something had been rattled loose and was less than optimal.

Gryzzk and Hoban walked to medical in silence, occasionally making way for a runner carrying parts or tools from one part of the ship to another. The medbay itself wasn't overflowing as much at the moment, as everyone who was capable of walking had simply acknowledged their prognosis, requested a painkiller, and gone to assist their respective section.

Both Cottles were there and both interceded as soon as Gryzzk and Hoban had entered and each put a hand on either Hoban or Gryzzk to stop them. Miss Doc Cottle spoke first.

""Major I know why you're here, and the answer is I will absolutely not release Miroka at this time. Despite her and your protests, she's still recovering from a mild concussion, cracked ribs and collarbones, and a separated sternum - that's not even going into the soft-tissue and internal injuries. We've already put her on an accelerated healing schedule but it'll be a few hours before she can walk more than ten feet without barfing or fainting.""

Mister Doc Cottle added to the initial briefing. ""And there is no amount of command authority that will make her heal faster. You can't break the laws of biology, and biology says rest. Even if the patient refuses to believe it. And before you even ask Hoban, you cannot snog her back to health. She ain't sleeping beauty.""

Gryzzk scrunched his face. ""I would like to visit her and brief her on our plans for when she is able to return to duty.""

The two doctors glanced and shared a sigh before there was a nod from Mister Cottle. ""Lenna will supervise her vitals. If they get out of range, you're out. No ifs, ands or buts.""

""I concur with Leonard."" Miss Cottle's face spoke with a weary authority.

The two doctors shared another look as Gryzzk nodded. ""We will behave appropriately.""

""We'll hold you to it. This way.""

Lenna Cottle led the two back to the rear of the bay, where Miroka was laying in a curtained off area with very dim light. Her scent brightened noticeably when she saw Hoban.

""Post. You should be at your station.""

Hoban quirked a grin. ""Well, we gotta talk about how you're going to do some neat stuff as soon as you walk out of here.""

Miroka tried to swivel out of bed, only to be restrained by Miss Cottle with a firm hand on Miroka's midsection. ""Corporal, lay down. We have an entire company of bad patients, but you are not to follow their idiot lead.""

Miroka pouted as her eyes fixed on the doctor. ""I am needed.""

""The bed needs you more. They're only here to talk.""

Gryzzk nodded. ""Corporal. Please, follow the doctor's orders. We have a situation that will require your expertise, but that situation hasn't arrived yet. In a few hours, we're going to be flying both ships in tandem to Tosche Station orbiting Hurdop Prime. It is going to require two pilots working as one. It is fortunate that the two of you are familiar with the concept. Miroka, you will be at the helm of this ship while Hoban flies the *Svitre's Vengeance*. It will be challenging, but not impossible. I would like both of you to begin working out the particulars."" He glanced at Miss-Doc Cottle who frowned but nodded.

Hoban smiled softly, taking a chair and settling to talk to Miroka. Gryzzk and Cottle left, with the doctor frowning at the Major.

""Sir, that wasn't necessary. You could have briefed her in a few hours when she could walk.""

""Respectfully doctor, we need to move forward."" Gryzzk's hands were busy as he lightly touched every patient in the medbay with a gentle assurance. ""To that end, we need to begin planning to determine the errors we can see and avoid them.""

There was a soft sigh. ""The Moncilat were such good patients.""

""I will assist in any way I can."" Gryzzk left and started circulating through the ship to receive updates without any additional taxing of Rosie's systems. Finally at the airlock, he met with Robau.

""Captain, status?""

""Only thing living and breathing on this thing is us. Three traps rendered inert. You need a nap sir.""

""We all need a nap. Engineering in place?""

""They're working on it now. According to Tucker, it looks like Hurdop and Vilantia have pretty much been copying each other's homework for awhile now.""

""Excellent."" Gryzzk paused for a moment. ""Thank you for your assistance, captain.""

""All I can say sir is this company better be due for one hell of a bonus.""

""I'm certain you are. Carry on.""

Gryzzk made his way back to the bridge. Along the way, he encountered more than a few members of the company sleeping in the corridors, most of them with tools in hand. Finally he settled into his command chair, feeling like he finally belonged there again. He set his tablet in place, reading the reports of the ship being ready to move again before glancing about to the aroma of what was probably coffee that may have been liberated from the engineering stores. Edwards and O'Brien had taken over their stations, with their counterparts quietly asleep in front of the consoles. Yomios had fallen asleep in her crash harness. Gryzzk shook his head slightly.

""Sergeant Major, have the company quarters suddenly become inadequate?""

""Some of them, yep. We got minor atmo-breaches all along the portside that are patched but not pretty. Not to put too fine a point on it, but once this job's done we're probably going to be in dock for a bit for what'll pass for proper repair. XO says that the officers have tried to tell their platoons to lay off, but the consensus from enlisteds has been some variation of 'Go fuck yourself, sir.' We'll manage ourselves.""

""Or to borrow a phrase I recently learned, they're all about to start ah, 'pissing on the electric fence'. I would rather they not.""

The bridge doors opened to admit both Miroka and Miss-Doc Cottle. Both were frowning, though for different reasons.

The doctor glared at Gryzzk. ""They got their plan together, and she insisted on taking the helm as quickly as possible. Leonard advises that you are a damned viking hobbit. I'm here to monitor her vitals.""

Gryzzk sat up straighter, making his way to the conference room and getting a chair. ""Sit, doctor. We'll be getting underway shortly.""

Once everyone was settled, Gryzzk tapped his tablet for shipwide announcement.

""All personnel, this is Freelord Gryzzk. The company is to be congratulated for their efforts. By way of congratulation, all non-essential personnel are to immediately begin drawing bedding and report to the dayroom for a rest period. All essential personnel are to draw bedding and report to the dayroom in fifteen minutes. Use that time to complete your current tasking and turn your duties over to the XO. Bridge personnel, we will begin moving shortly.""

O'Brien looked back to Gryzzk, expression satisfied. ""So in event of a catastrophe...""

""...the bridges, medical, and dayroom eject, easing the time for rescue, yes.""

The next minutes were tense as people were roused and moved, but finally everything was green across the board. Gryzzk nodded with something that wasn't satisfaction, but readiness for what was next.

""Corporal Miroka, show us the way to Hurdop please.""

There was a slight grinding noise as the engines accelerated imperfectly, causing noises and vibrations to ripple through both ships. It took several minutes for the pilots to synchronize, but the two ships began a slow trajectory toward Hurdop that sped up incrementally as Miroka and Hoban kept talking in the shorthand that gave Gryzzk a flashback to the low-level madness flight to Vilantianic Stadium.

The next hours were an exercise in tense boredom, as everyone waited for something to happen that didn't - eventually the ships were within visual of Tosche Station, which caused orbital control and Yomios to have a conversation.

""Say again your status, *Twilight Rose*.""

Yomios closed her eyes as she repeated what she'd said. ""Tosche control, we suffered catastrophic fusion with a pirate vessel, requesting oversize berthing space for dock.""

Control came back. ""*Twilight Rose*, you haven't filed clearance or exception requests for two vessels.""

Gryzzk sighed softly as Yomios stared owlishly at her console before looking back to Gryzzk helplessly. Bureaucracy had made a comfortable den on the station. ""Corporal, if I may...?""

Yomios nodded as Gryzzk moved to her station to speak. ""Tosche Control, this is Freelord Major Gryzzk commanding the *Twilight Rose*. Gunner's Mate Kiole of the *Lord A'Pruance* is currently asleep in my dayroom; but we would both consider it a great kindness if you allowed us to dock before filling out the necessary paperwork in addition to filing a formal complaint against the captain and pilot of the *Svitre's Vengeance* \- it may appear in your registry as the *Svitre's Justice*. We have their letter of marque and wish to turn it in for correct processing, however we will not be able to do so until we have docked. Our AI is currently dedicating a great deal of processing to maintaining essential ship functions and will remain that way until we can offload life support and other essential functions to the station.""

The voice and scent changed tone to a slightly more respectful one. It seemed that mentioning Kiole was a route to relief from the evils of functionaries. ""We understand. Dock C-Three will be available shortly, Freelord."" There was a pause. ""What specific charges do you have?""

Gryzzk paused. ""Out of respect, I would prefer to speak of such things directly with you. I will request that Gunner's Mate Kiole personally thank you for your assistance.""

The unspoken barter hung in the air for a few moments. ""Understood.""

With that tiny bump out of the way, the two ships docked carefully and connections established. It took a few minutes, but Rosie's form finally showed up on the bridge.

""Freelord, I hope we're in a good spot because I got this thing on my leg that someone should maybe look at.""",23,1755010835.0,HFY,14,0.96,False

Next thing I know a couple people from the next site over wander up like “uhhh what is that smell??” 😂 Ended up pulling a few shots for total strangers. Guess that’s how you make friends in the woods lol. Used about 16g, ground pretty fine, tamped (probably too hard tbh), ran it for around 30 seconds? Didn’t measure much, just went by feel. Shot came out super sweet somehow. Maybe the cold air made it taste better idk.

Honestly it was one of the best mornings I’ve had in a while. Coffee outside just hits different. Anyone else ever have random ppl just appear when you’re brewing somewhere?

1mob28p,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/1mob28p/2_years_later_it_gets_better/,2 years later... IT GETS BETTER,"Rediscovered this subreddit and wanted to (re)share my story for anyone in the trenches. Backstory: my ex and I were together from 19-26. Seven years, pets, homeowners, the full works. We were in the process of getting a puppy and just finished renovating the forever home we'd purchased a year prior when I discovered he cheated on me with a girl at work. Emotionally and physically, then carried on speaking to her after it came out while deciding if he still wanted to be with me. Check my previous posts for the full whammy.

I actually posted something similar a year ago. However as I've learned so much since, I am sharing in the hope it might help those of us who are in the later stages of recovery, which brings me to...

**1. Do you ever get over it?** The million dollar question. My DDay was March 2023, and he broke up with me (lol) in June. So it's been a little over two years, most of which I spent living in the house we bought together while it sold and surrounded by memories an the architecture of our relationship. I think it's less about getting over it (how do you 'get over' a life-changing trauma?) and more about reframing it as something that happens to you, not who you are. There will be whispers and reminders forever - especially if you were with someone for a long time - but the more time that passes, the lighter and less frequent they become.

**2. Go no contact.** You cannot heal in the house that hurt you. Whether you want to reconcile or not, you need time. Space. You need to focus on you. Process what's happened. I learned this the hard way, and because my ex and I owned a home we had to speak about solicitors, agents, furniture, finances. Every time it snowballed into personal stuff, it battered me. Every single time, without exception. So if you legitimately need to speak, either find an intermediary or keep it to essential contact only. I know it's hard and all you want to do is hear their voice and feel their presence, but that version of the person you loved is gone. This person is a stranger. Even worse, a stranger who has hurt you. The sooner you do it, the speedier your healing journey will move.

**3. Be fucking nice to yourself.** I'll say this one again. Cut yourself a fucking break. If I had £ for every time I said 'I'm a mess, I'm terrible company, I'm pathetic, why can't I get over this, I'm miserable why can't I handle it better'. You are going through a horrible, horrible experience. Likely one you didn't see coming. Definitely one you didn't deserve. So please keep that in mind when the shitty little voice in the back of your head berates you. You're doing your best, that's enough. Big and little things - the way you speak to yourself, accepting help from your loved ones, a nice takeaway, a coffee for the road - do it. I used to get my nails done because I wanted to feel pretty and put together (at least on the outside), and as a little act, it went a long way,

**4. Accept infidelity is like an enormous onion.** This is something I've only clocked in the last 6 months. There are layers and layers and layers to how you're going to feel. In my initial stages I genuinely believed I had the most fulfilling, perfect relationship on earth and we were soulmates and I would never recover. Now I can look back and say he had lots of good traits, but he didn't/couldn't meet a lot of my needs. I lost my sense of self. He was a liar and a coward. And I held us together, not the other way around. He was also deeply unhappy and didn't have the tools to communicate that. Does this resonate? I'm sure I still have more to peel back too. The first few layers are raw and rough and painful - that's the initial stages of finding out, the shock, the grief, the anger. Then as time goes on, depending on the length and strength and depth, you learn more about yourself and the relationship you (thought you) had. And there will be lots of tears. I could have filled an Olympic swimming pool. But that is okay, and leads me nicely to-

**5. Feel your feelings**. Say a big fuck off to those who say you need to get a hold of yourself, they're not worth your tears, all that jazz. Cry if you want to cry, if it helps you. Go on long screamy drives. Wallow, ruminate (in one hour chunks), sob snotty tears over your mates. You're a human being going through a complicated, unexpected trauma. Avoid hurtful, dangerous behaviours (you'll know - don't do it), but take the time to let your feelings out and find peace in the calm after the storm. Moving on doesn't mean pretending you don't care and repressing your feelings, it means putting one (sometimes wobbly) foot in front of the other. Also for those who are months/years out - you can still feel sad. Obvs! There's no time limit on grief. As time has passed, I've found my feelings are more intricate (loss, disconnection, indifference) which I find difficult to process. But I'll get there.

**6. Trust that time makes things better**. Sorry, this is the fucker. Because you can't rush it. You can't make time go faster, even when you reeeeeeeeally truly can't face it anymore. So whatever you need to do (again, avoid the bad shit) to help time go a little quicker on the tough days - you do that. Unapologetically. I poured over these subreddits, I read everything available online about cheating and attachment theory and grief and conflict resolution. It soothed me. I recorded voice notes and played them back to myself. I researched the central nervous system and it helped me understand why my hair was falling out, why I had no appetite, why I threw myself into chaotic distractions. Then when I felt a little stronger, I picked up new hobbies, got strong, did things out of my comfort zone. I had therapy, I dated, I took myself on a solo holiday. I got loads wrong, but it didn't stop time passing.

**7. Survival vs living**. Do not put pressure on yourself. You see how I said *when I felt a little stronger?* The break up arc isn't linear. Your life is not an aesthetic *Come with me to glow up after he cheated!* TikTok. Reality is ugly, and it's hard. You will flit in and out of survival mode. So refer back to 3. and take it a day at a time. Life and joy come back (they do, I promise they do), and in the interim all you need to do is hang in there and get through each day that comes and goes.

**8. Know you're going to be ok**. Sorry - had to end on a generic, meaningless one. Why? Because it's true. Why? Because you have to be. That's it. You literally have to be - you have no choice. And fuck me it's shit and it's hard and it's so fucking unfair, but you are going to get through it because life will keep coming at you. My healing journey (cringe) has had more ups and downs than Alton Towers. The crippling reality of trying to singlehandedly sell our home and buy my own, hold down a full time, demanding job, stay sane and push forward was crushing in a way people not in this club could never understand. But you will discover reserves of strength, compassion and resilience you didn't know you had. And now I know there's nothing I can't get through, and although I resent what it took for me to realise that, I take enormous comfort from it.",17,1755010773.0,survivinginfidelity,9,1.0,False

As someone who often finds themselves indoors with limited sunlight exposure, Vitamin D supplements are a regular part of my wellness routine. This particular product caught my eye, boasting its ""sunshine in a bottle"" promise along with claims of supporting immune health, bone density, and muscle function. Naturally, I was curious to see if it lives up to the hype—or just blends into the endless line of Vitamin D3 options out there.

**Packaging and Form Factor**  
Opening the bottle was my first encounter with this softgel supplement, and I’ll give kudos where it’s due—the design is straightforward and no-nonsense. The mini softgels are compact, making them easy to swallow. Anyone who has struggled with giant tablets knows how much of a relief this can be. The softgels come bathed in organic extra virgin olive oil, which aids in absorption, as Vitamin D3 is fat-soluble. I also appreciated the clear labeling, indicating that it’s non-GMO, unflavored, and gluten-free. However, the flipping bottles stuck together slightly when shaken, which is apparently a normal issue—giving the bottle a sturdy knock on the counter usually sorted this out.

**Ease of Consistency**  
As someone with a busy schedule, I appreciate low-maintenance supplementation. The recommended dosage is just one softgel daily, making it almost impossible to forget. Personally, I keep the bottle near my coffee machine, so incorporating it into my morning routine became seamless. Even my father, who’s notorious for forgetting to take his medication, found this pill size and frequency manageable. Its one-year supply of 360 capsules eliminates the need for the constant hassle of monthly refills.

**Benefits**  
Testing this supplement over a couple of weeks, I found myself feeling more energetic during my daily workout routine—a noticeable factor since consistent energy levels are usually challenging to sustain. I’d expect a long-term improvement in bone health, especially for those with deficiencies. Although the effects on immunity weren’t overt (hard to measure without getting sick—thankfully, I didn’t), I’m compelled to trust in its D3 content.

- Small, easy-to-swallow softgels.  
- Gluten-free and non-GMO formula.  
- Effective absorption with olive oil.  

[Check NatureWise NW10057 price on Amazon.](https://healthquay.com/p/b00gb85jr4/)  

**What I Didn’t Love**  
While I’ve mostly enjoyed this product, no supplement is without flaws. For starters, warm weather or improper storage caused some clumping among the pills. This didn’t affect the quality or efficacy, but shaking or knocking the bottle gets old quickly. Additionally, while the product excels in purity, the packaging could use some improvement to avoid such instances altogether.

- Softgels tend to clump in warm weather.  
- Packaging could be optimized for better storage.  

**Competing Products**  
Compared to some of the other big names in Vitamin D supplementation, this bottle stands its ground surprisingly well. Brands like Nature Made and NOW Foods are the competition I often test side-by-side with similar claims regarding purity and high absorption. However, the mini softgel size and inclusion of organic olive oil give this product a slight edge over others that might use a blander delivery system. On the flip side, competitors often have more temperature-resilient packaging, which could be a dealbreaker for long storage in warmer climates. 

**Quality for Price**  
One of the best factors about this supplement is its price-to-quality ratio. With 360 softgels in each bottle, you’re effectively getting a year’s worth of convenience. Comparing it to other Vitamin D3 products with shorter supply durations makes this an incredibly cost-efficient choice. It’s ideal for families or households aiming to cover a long-term commitment to their vitamin intake. This supplement truly feels worth every penny for its simplicity, high absorption, and notable coverage of daily wellness essentials.

Picture this: you’re cruising down the Bitcoin highway, ready to make your big transaction. You’ve double-checked the address (because no one wants to accidentally send Bitcoin to a random cat-themed wallet), you’ve set the amount, you’ve hit “send”... and then… nothing. Your transaction is stuck. Waiting. Crawling through the mempool like it’s Monday morning traffic.

That’s when you need a turbo boost — and that’s exactly what [**Bitcoin TX Accelerate**](https://www.txaccelerate.com) is here for!

# 🏎️ The Blockchain Fast Lane

Bitcoin transactions are a bit like cars on a freeway. Some have priority lanes (those with higher fees), while others are stuck in the slow lane, sipping lukewarm coffee and honking at the miner ahead. If your transaction fee is too low, you can find yourself stranded, watching newer, faster cars zoom past.

**Bitcoin TX Accelerate** is your express pass to the front of the line. It’s a transaction accelerator that helps push your Bitcoin transaction into the spotlight, giving it a better chance to be confirmed quickly. In other words: no more twiddling your thumbs while the mempool grows to the size of a small moon.

# ⚡ How It Works (Without the Boring Bits)

Here’s the simple magic: you pop your stuck Bitcoin transaction ID (TXID) into [**Bitcoin TX Accelerate**](https://www.txaccelerate.com), hit the accelerate button, and let the system do its thing. It broadcasts your transaction to additional miners and nodes, increasing its visibility and giving it a VIP invite to get mined.

It’s like upgrading from a rusty bicycle to a rocket-powered scooter. Suddenly, your transaction has style, speed, and a very high chance of getting noticed.

# 🎯 Why You’ll Love It

* **Speed Matters** — Nobody likes waiting hours (or days!) for a transaction to confirm.
* **Stress-Free** — Stop obsessively refreshing your block explorer.
* **Simple to Use** — No tech jargon required; if you can paste a TXID, you can accelerate.
* **Cost-Effective** — A small price to save you from the frustration of slow confirmations.

# 🕒 The Problem with Slow Transactions

Bitcoin’s beauty is in its decentralization — but that also means miners prioritize transactions with better fees. During high network congestion, your “regular” fee might suddenly be laughably small compared to the whales tossing out mega-fees. Without a little help, your transaction could sit there for hours like it’s waiting for a bus in the middle of the desert.

That’s where **Bitcoin TX Accelerate** saves the day — it puts your transaction back in the race.

# 🌍 Perfect for… Everyone

Whether you’re sending Bitcoin to a friend, paying for something online, or moving funds between wallets, no one wants to wait forever. Traders, merchants, miners — basically anyone who deals with Bitcoin — can benefit from a little acceleration magic.

So next time you’re staring at a stuck Bitcoin transaction, don’t panic, and definitely don’t curse at your computer. Just give it a speed boost with [**Bitcoin TX Accelerate**](https://www.txaccelerate.com).

1moayuj,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1moayuj/why_is_the_ninja_cm300_coffee_maker_a_gamechanger/,Why is the Ninja CM300 Coffee Maker a Game-Changer for Your Kitchen?,"The Ninja CM300 coffee maker has been a delightful addition to my kitchen, both for its practicality and aesthetic appeal. As someone who enjoys a variety of coffee experiences, from a single cup brimming with warmth to an entire carafe shared among friends, it has fit seamlessly into my daily routine. The sleek black design with stainless steel accents gives it a modern edge that blends effortlessly with my other appliances. I must admit, at first, I thought it might be just another coffee maker, but it quickly proved me wrong.

**Upsides**

- The versatility of the brewing options is an absolute game-changer.
- I especially love the Over Ice function; it ensures my iced coffee is flavorful without being diluted.
- The removable water reservoir has saved me from spilling water all over my counter countless times.
- It’s also fully automatic, which means less fuss in the early mornings.

Brewing with the Ninja CM300 feels intuitive. You can choose between three brew styles: Classic, Rich, and Over Ice. Each setting gives a distinct flavor profile, and the best part is the coffee doesn’t taste burnt, even if it has been sitting on the warming plate for hours. Ninja’s adjustable warming plate keeps coffee hot for up to four hours, perfect for those lazy weekend mornings when I sip my way through an entire pot.  

[Check Ninja CM300 price on Amazon.](https://ngadgets.com/p/b09xy4h285/)

**Design Perks**

The compact dimensions, standing at 12 inches deep, 8.75 inches wide, and 15 inches high, fit neatly on my counter without hogging precious space. It seems every detail has been thoughtfully considered. The reusable filter is another feature I appreciate, eliminating the need for disposable paper filters that often end up being wasteful. Having a removable reservoir isn’t just practical for refilling but also makes cleaning less of a chore, a small-yet-noticeable convenience I don’t take for granted.

**Negatives**

- The coffee scoop was missing from the box, though the absence didn’t impact the coffee-making process, but it felt like an odd oversight.
- At 10.08 pounds, it’s slightly heavier compared to some lightweight competitors.
- Some might find the water reservoir slightly tricky to dry completely after cleaning.

I had a minor hiccup figuring out the correct ratio for brewing iced coffee, but the results were absolutely worth it once I dialed it in. The vivid iced coffee flavor on a hot summer afternoon is unbeatable. Keep in mind, though, that the water level indicator lines are a little hard to read—I need to squint, especially under dim lighting. Otherwise, setting up and operating the coffee maker couldn’t be easier.

**Competitive Options**

Comparing this product to brands like Keurig or Cuisinart, I can see both its strengths and weaker points. While some Keurig models offer pod-based convenience, I think the Ninja CM300 stands out for its sustainability with its reusable filter. On the flip side, some Cuisinart models, boasting more premium features like additional specialty brews or sleek digital interfaces, may attract users seeking those extras. However, neither of these options is as adaptable when shifting between making a single cup and a full carafe—something the Ninja CM300 handles beautifully.  

**Smart Spending**

You’ll get a great blend of utility and flair for the price. Its ability to produce café-quality flavors at home makes it a budget-friendly alternative to spending on overpriced coffee shop beverages. While it’s not necessarily a high-end, luxury coffee machine, it’s more than capable of delivering a satisfying caffeine fix while being easy on the wallet. That, combined with the extensive brewing sizes, means you get reliable performance and convenience without overspending.

He goes to the pub often enough to be concerning, and reassures himself that at least he's getting good essays out of it. You may judge for yourself:*

\---

I did not set out to do anthropology. I set out to have a beer. The other regular haunts near my flat skewed geriatric, and while I can happily talk to a septuagenarian about buses, I was in the mood for music that did not predate the Falklands. The bar I wandered into had a younger crowd, a decent playlist, and discrete details I somehow failed to parse until much later. Pride flags on the walls. A very large pride flag by the door. A clientele that could only be described as statistically enriched for men in nice shoes.

I was nursing a Tennent's when one of the patrons approached the bar and ordered what appeared to be a small chemistry set worth of brightly colored shots. The logistics fascinated me: he deployed some kind of carrying apparatus that locked under the shot glasses at the rim, allowing safe transport of the entire collection. The British have always been quiet pioneers of Applied Alcoholism, and the field has clearly advanced beyond what I learned in medical school.

""Hey handsome,"" he said, noticing my interest. ""Sorry if I end up spilling any of this on you.""
I assured him this would be fine, since spilled alcohol represents free alcohol, which represents savings.
""I wouldn't mind licking it off you, if you know what I mean.""

I experienced a sudden cutaneous vasodilation, a blush, which I hoped was obscured by my facial hair and the ambient lighting. The complexion probably helps.

His companion laughed, but the interaction quickly resolved into a gesture of goodwill. They offered me one of the shots. Morbid curiosity being a powerful motivator, I accepted. The taste was not unpleasant. Upon turning to share this assessment with the group, I was met with expectant looks.
""It wasn't bad,"" I offered. ""I could see myself drinking this.""
""If you think this wasn't bad,"" a different member of the group replied, ""then you'll probably like antifreeze.""

I answered, mostly sober at that point, that I had not yet tried antifreeze but remained open-minded.

Etiquette required reciprocation. Also, heterosexual uncertainty suggested that free liquor in a gay bar might have exchange rates I was not qualified to negotiate, so I bought two shots and took them over. The bartender had hinted that the recipients did not like Gordon’s, which I could respect as a principled position. The group received the offering warmly, then kept me at the table as if a recruitable stray cat had decided to sit in their sunbeam.

##### Cast and setting

There were six of them, give or take my blood alcohol level. Most looked like ordinary men dressed for a Saturday night, with more piercings and better grooming. The one who had flirted at the bar was the outlier. Wife-beater, small tattoos scattered like confetti, a bull ring large enough to restrain mythological fauna. Call him FG, for Flamboyant Gent. His friend with the quick laugh was slight and balding. SG. The third I spoke with most was conventionally handsome and soft-edged in a way that suggests many women have fallen for him and then discovered the plot twist. HG, for Hetero-passing Gent.

I clarified my presence, attributing it to a combination of cultural unfamiliarity and severe myopia. FG gestured towards the numerous pride flags. I claimed to have interpreted them as generic contemporary decor. He then indicated the very large flag by the entrance, to which I could only plead a fundamental lack of situational awareness.

They inquired about my purpose in a city not famed for its nightlife. I gave my standard exposition: I am a doctor, recently relocated from a Small Scottish Town (SST). This news was met with uniform approval. My subsequent anecdote about drunken misadventures in SST was also successful, though their perspective on such small communities was predictably negative. A lot of them disclosed that they had grown up in nearly indistinguishable SSTs, and hadn't enjoyed it. The low-anonymity, high-surveillance environment of a small town is likely a suboptimal habitat for a gay man.

They were all locals. They were also colleagues, sort of. Not mine, yet. Two worked in the biochemistry lab at the same trust where I work in psychiatry. The third did something nearby in clinical science that I forgot as the evening progressed.

We found common ground commiserating over the state of the NHS circa 2025. FG complained about ill-conceived sample requests from junior doctors at inconvenient hours. I reassured him that psychiatry was a low-impact requester; my biochemistry screens were routine and rarely urgent. This professional courtesy earned me an offer of expedited service for future lithium level checks, which I noted for potential future use.

I was also offered, variously, two blowjobs, a rimjob, and a golden shower. I declined with gratitude. It is good to be desired. It is also good to have boundaries. 

(As wise men have said: if you're struggling on the local dating apps, it might not be your fault and there's hope for you yet. But if you go to a gay bar and *don't* get hit on, it might be time to see if monasteries are recruiting) 

At one point I unlocked my phone to show photos from Dover. This triggered knowing looks. “So, you are not gay, are you?” Correct. They explained that no gay man would casually open his gallery in public. Too high a risk of unexpected appearances. I learned something.

""Such a shame,"" FG added, ""especially when you're dressed like that."" My attire, a polo shirt under a pullover, was chosen for its extreme neutrality. I suppose this can create its own kind of allure through sheer demureness. 

I was informed of some romantic tension. SG and HG both had crushes on each other, but neither would make a move. Were they both bottoms? I tentatively asked. Nah, one's a bottom, but the other is a verse. 

When they heard FG explaining this to me, HG claimed that he had, in fact, tried to kiss SG, but had been rebuffed. SG was affronted and explained that it hadn't been a good time, he'd been chewing on a chicken tender when the former had attempted to tongue-punch him in the tonsils. They both laughed, and began making up for wasted time. Ah, young love, don't you love to see it? 

By now the ethnographer in me, who had apparently decided to write this post retroactively, began asking questions. I apologized for being nosy, but they laughed it off. The answers, heavily paraphrased and possibly misremembered after several Tennent’s, were as follows:

**Q1. Poppers**

How common are poppers in actual practice? FG looked at me like I had asked how common forks are at dinner. The table consensus: some had used them, none were evangelists. They shared two cautionary fables about people who treated poppers as shooters or aerosolized them and died. The bartender volunteered that poppers slowed time and elongated orgasms.

An unexpected corollary was also disclosed: a high incidence of incontinence issues among the group, to the point where coffee consumption was a calculated risk. They then fielded a surprising counter-query: Does applying sugar to a prolapsed anus aid in its reduction? I admitted that while the technique was vaguely familiar from medical lore, if I tried to put it into practice on the wards, the nurses would have me up in front of the GMC or the police in short order. 

**Q2. Cleanliness protocols**

Do people douche before anal sex? After some deliberation, the consensus was no, not routinely. Diet was preferred. Eat fiber, manage timing, accept that risk can be reduced but not eliminated. You get used to it. I shared that several heterosexual experiments of mine had ended with olfactory regret. They said that in a male-male context the polite response would be to send the man to the shower or call for a reschedule. I said that if I tried that with a woman I would be killed, slowly, and possibly correctly.


**Q3. Closeted and bi men**

How often do you encounter men who are closeted or who identify as bi? FG avoids them. Too messy, too much drama, too many norm mismatches, and in his experience too much reluctance to test for STIs. Others nodded. This was not about identity policing. It was about risk management.

**Q4. Grindr**

Grindr, yes or no? A unanimous no. The people on it were described as crazy in the technical sense. Word of mouth, mutual friends, and the bar network work better. I said I had expected at least one notification during the evening. I declined to explain how I know the sound.

**Q5. PrEP and HIV risk**

Are you on PrEP? Only FG. He is meticulous about screening and uses PrEP as insurance. He also thinks gay men are unfairly blamed for both HIV and monkeypox, and claimed that heterosexuals now acquire both at higher rates while gay men are just more honest and tested more. I had strong reservations about that claim, and made a note to check later. It was not the time for a literature review in a bar where I had been offered a golden shower five minutes earlier.

**Q6. Bug chasers**

Do bug chasers still exist? Only FG had even heard of them, and he is slightly older. He said the phenomenon is almost extinct, and was already rare when he came out. He explained the idea for the younger men, who reacted with the combination of curiosity and horror that usually attends bad Victorian surgery.

**Q7. Baths**

Do people have sex in the baths? Yes, says FG, wistfully reminiscing about a visit to San Francisco. 

Is it *hygienic*? Probably not, he confides. But much like swimming in a kiddie pool, you have to have your faith in the antiseptic properties of chlorine. 

**Q8. Straight people in gay spaces**

Is my presence in a gay bar objectionable? 

Not *you*, you seem like a nice and open-minded lad. But in general? 

They gave a quick lesson in ecological progression. A gay bar/night club opens and serves a mostly LGBT clientele. Straight women discover it is a space where they can be drunk and loud without constant male attention (they're very popular for hen-dos). Straight men discover that straight women are there. The venue drifts toward generic nightlife. Even worse, some of these men are alleged to be rather bigoted, and FG said he wasn't willing to take the risk of being socked in the face for merely kissing a partner on the dance floor. 

According to him, the only reliable counterpressure is to make the environment clearly and unambiguously queer. Sex in dark corners and in toilets tends to discourage straight tourists and is conveniently hard to legislate away without awkward free speech arguments. They mentioned the only other gay bar nearby, owned by a man who is both gay and loudly hostile to trans people. They had taken their business elsewhere.

My new friends left early. Sunday shifts wait for no man. I stayed until closing and fell in love at a distance with a woman who was almost certainly a lesbian and possibly autistic. Short hair, noise-cancelling earphones in, a single beer, a one-handed game controller, a dog’s full attention, an older man attempting conversation and doing no visible damage. I did not ask for her number. In a Hollywood version of this evening I would mature, learn a lesson about acceptance, and end with a chaste coffee. In the realistic version I walked home slightly drunk, slightly wiser, and extremely grateful that a bar full of men who had no reason to be kind to me were kind anyway.

##### Methods, such as they were:

This was opportunistic qualitative sampling. The ethnographer was three drinks in and had accepted a blue shot of unknown pedigree. The participants were friendly and practiced at explaining themselves to outsiders. There was music. There were interruptions. Recall bias is certain. Social desirability bias is probable. My notes consist of the phrases I kept repeating to myself while walking home and the sentences that reappeared in my head the next morning like uninvited guests. If you want preregistration and a codebook, you will be disappointed.

When I got into sports (parkour and running), I lost a lot of weight and never had trouble getting dates or attending social events. Then in 2019, depression hit me, and then covid. I became so inactive that my fat bank was breaking personal records in profits. Needless to say, my libido tanked, and I missed out on any team activities at work and in my hobbies. My confidence was at an all-time low.

6 months ago, I got a gym membership and have been working hard since. I refreshed my wardrobe and picked up some tight t-shirts.

I even got free coffee and a pastry after a short conversation. Friends have given me compliments too. I'm currently cutting, and while I feel like I'm only halfway there, it still feels amazing to see my effort paying off.

My concern is that my focus has started shifting too much toward one area of improvement - my looks. I'm trying to find a better balance, since lately I've been neglecting work and some hobbies as I focus more on feeling ready to ""go out there"".

The shot tasted great, using Colorfull's Chocolate Wafer Espresso, and its starkly different from the other shots and shots I've pulled on the Bambino so far. It didnt have an initial sourness, improved the bitterness (in a positive way) and really honed in on the chocolate cake flavour. 

However, some notes are that it took me over a minute to pull, with I would say 10-15 seconds of preinfusion. I actually also hit 9 bar for the first time today where I was only getting up to 6 yesterday and the day prior. I think I'll probably coarsen the grinder by 3-5 clicks. I'm going off the initial framework of trying to pull a shot in 25-30 seconds. I'm using James Hoffmans recipe in one of his videos (17g coffee, but a bit more than 60g of water to try to get about 42.5 out).   
  
I'm also getting some issues of channeling in the puck. Looking at the coffee puck after a shot, theres dark spots at the bottom of it in a ring shape following the tapered contours of the basket. Just wondering if this is an issue even if the shot still tastes pretty good.

Sorry for the long post. All advice is appreciated!",2,1755010427.0,CafelatRobot,7,0.67,False
1moawsl,https://i.redd.it/or8tobmlolif1.png,"Mold, Mycotoxins, and Genetics","Exposure to mycotoxins can produce various physical responses, depending on the toxin, exposure route, amount, and individual genetic differences. Here’s what research shows:

**Mitochondrial dysfunction:**  
This mycotoxin can impair mitochondrial function and inhibit the synthesis of certain proteins.\[[ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4922809/)\] Even at very low levels, mycotoxins, such as aflatoxin, can cause mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. In the mitochondria, mycotoxins can cause disruption in the respiratory chain, decreasing the production of ATP and leading to chronic diseases.\[[ref](https://iubmb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/iub.1932)\] Some mycotoxins, such as patulin, can bind to thiol groups in glutathione, thus decreasing this essential cellular antioxidant. Without enough glutathione, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction.\[[ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7674415/)\]

**Lung inflammation:**   
An inflammatory response occurs when lung tissue is exposed to airborne trichothecenes. IL-1B increases in a manner dependent on NLRP3 activation.\[[ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4922809/)\] Aflatoxin G1 airborne exposure significantly increases inflammation in the lung. \[[ref](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30478833/)\] *Stacchybotry chartarum*, also known as black mold, produces trichothecenes that can enter the lungs and cause inflammation and allergic symptoms.\[[ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8949390/)\]

I want to take a moment to do a bit of ‘myth busting’ here. One question that I get asked fairly often is how to find the **mold genes** in 23andMe data. There is a lot of confusion and oversimplification being promoted on the internet about “mold genes”.

There are quite a few studies on the genetic variants involved in reactions to individual mycotoxins. Most of these variants are related to the **detoxification pathways.**

Phase I detoxification involves the modification of toxins by cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver, making them more polar and reactive. Phase II detoxification follows, where these modified toxins are conjugated with molecules like glucuronide, sulfate, or glutathione, making them water-soluble and easier to excrete from the body. Often molecules that are acted upon by phase I enzymes are then also made water-soluble and excretable using phase II enzymes. Thus, **phase I detoxification needs to be in sync with phase II detoxification.** 

CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 are important phase I detoxification genes for a couple of types of aflatoxins.  The UGT and GST family of genes are important for the phase II detoxification of several different types of mycotoxins. Variants that decrease gene function here are pretty common.

Exposure to mycotoxins, such as aflatoxin, consumes glutathione in the reduction of oxidative stress, leading to lower levels of glutathione.\[[ref](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0748233720928169)\] **N-acetylcysteine (NAC)** is a precursor for glutathione production. Supplemental N-acetylcysteine has been shown in studies to modulate inflammation and increase detoxification.\[[ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5937417/)\] Research shows that NAC reduces the damage from mycotoxin exposure by increasing glutathione and reducing oxidative damage.\[[ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6215273/)\]

What to Look for When Buying an Ice Maker

Selecting the right ice maker involves balancing your specific needs with the appliance’s features. Below are the critical factors to consider, with additional details to help you make an informed decision.

1. Size

The physical size of an ice maker determines both its ice production capacity and where it can be placed. Ice makers range from compact countertop models to large freestanding or undercounter units.

* Countertop Models: These are typically 8–12 inches wide and deep, and 11–15 inches tall, making them ideal for small kitchens, RVs, or offices. Examples include the COWSAR Ice Maker (10.39""D x 8.66""W x 11.22""H) and Kismile Nugget Ice Maker (11.29""D x 8.66""W x 12.68""H).
* Undercounter Models: Larger units (15–18 inches wide, 16–20 inches deep) like the GE Profile Opal 2.0 XL (17.5""D x 13.43""W x 16.5""H) fit under standard countertops, saving space while offering higher output.
* Freestanding Models: These are often larger, like commercial units, and require floor space or dedicated areas like garages or outdoor kitchens.

Considerations:

* Measure your available space, accounting for ventilation (most models need 4–8 inches of clearance on sides and back).
* For outdoor use, ensure the unit is CSA-certified for weather resistance to withstand heat, humidity, or rain.
* Portability matters for smaller units; look for models with handles (e.g., EUHOMY Nugget Ice Maker, Igloo) if you plan to move it frequently.

2. Capacity

Capacity refers to both daily ice production (pounds of ice made in 24 hours) and storage capacity (pounds of ice the bin can hold).

* Daily Production: Ranges from 26 lbs (e.g., COWSAR, Silonn) to 50 lbs (Newair Portable Ice Maker). Higher production suits large gatherings or heavy use, while 26–35 lbs is sufficient for most households.
* Storage Capacity: Varies from 1.2 lbs (Igloo) to 4.8 lbs (Newair). Some models, like the ecozy Smart Nugget Ice Maker, claim high storage (44 lbs), but this may reflect production rather than actual bin capacity, as most countertop units lack refrigeration to keep ice frozen.

Considerations:

* Match production to your needs. For example, 26 lbs/day is enough for 10–15 drinks, while 50 lbs/day suits parties or small businesses.
* Storage bins in countertop models are not refrigerated, so ice melts if not transferred to a freezer. Plan to bag and store ice for large events.
* Check water tank capacity (e.g., 2 L for GoveeLife vs. 1.1 L for Antarctic Star) to reduce refilling frequency.

3. Drainage System

Most ice makers recycle melted ice water back into the reservoir for new ice, but excess water needs proper drainage, especially for undercounter or freestanding models.

* Countertop Models: Typically have a drain plug at the bottom for manual draining during cleaning (e.g., Antarctic Star, ecozy Nugget).
* Undercounter/Freestanding Models: May require a floor drain or dedicated drain line to handle continuous water runoff, especially in high-output units.
* Self-Cleaning Feature: Many models (e.g., Kismile, EUHOMY, Silonn) include a self-cleaning mode that flushes water through the system, reducing maintenance but still requiring manual drainage afterward.

Considerations:

* Ensure your installation site has access to a drain or a way to collect water (e.g., a bucket for countertop models).
* For outdoor setups, confirm the drain system can handle environmental exposure without clogging.
* Regular descaling (using vinegar or specialized solutions) prevents mineral buildup, especially in hard water areas.

4. Location

Where you place your ice maker affects its performance and convenience.

* Kitchen: Countertop models like the AGLUCKY or HealSmart fit small spaces, while undercounter units like the GE Profile Opal 2.0 XL blend with cabinetry.
* Outdoor Areas: Models like certain KitchenAid undercounter units are CSA-certified for outdoor use, ideal for patios or poolside entertaining.
* Garage/RV/Office: Portable units with handles (e.g., Igloo, EUHOMY Nugget) are versatile for mobile or secondary spaces.
* Water Line: Most countertop models require manual water filling, but undercounter models like the GE Profile Opal 2.0 XL may connect to a water line or side tank, reducing refills.

Considerations:

* Ensure adequate ventilation (4–8 inches around the unit) to prevent overheating, as ice makers vent warm air during operation.
* Check power outlet availability (most use standard 120V outlets).
* For outdoor use, protect the unit from direct sunlight or extreme weather unless certified for outdoor conditions.

5. Style

Ice makers come in various designs to match your aesthetic and functional preferences.

* Materials: Stainless steel (e.g., Newair, Frigidaire) offers durability and a premium look, while plastic/metal blends (e.g., GoveeLife) are common in budget models.
* Colors: Most are silver, black, or stainless steel, but some brands offer unique finishes to match kitchen appliances.
* Accessories: Removable bins, scoops, and magnetic scoop holders (e.g., GE Profile) enhance usability. Some models include ice bags for storage (e.g., ecozy Nugget).
* Filtration: Built-in water filters (rare in countertop models) or TDS meters (e.g., ecozy Smart Nugget) ensure cleaner, better-tasting ice.
* Smart Features: Wi-Fi, app control, and voice compatibility (e.g., GoveeLife, ecozy Smart Nugget) allow remote operation and scheduling.

Considerations:

* Choose a finish that complements your space (e.g., stainless steel for modern kitchens).
* Prioritize accessories like scoops or bins for convenience, especially for frequent use.
* Smart features are ideal for tech-savvy users who want to automate ice production.

6. Efficiency

Ice makers vary in energy consumption, typically ranging from 88 W (COWSAR) to 300 W (GE Profile Opal 2.0 XL).

* Energy Star Certification: Rare in countertop models but available in some undercounter units, reducing operating costs.
* Wattage: Lower-wattage models (e.g., EUHOMY Nugget at 15.63 W, COWSAR at 88 W) are more energy-efficient but may produce less ice.
* Operation Mode: Some models (e.g., GE Profile) allow scheduling to run only when needed, saving energy.

Considerations:

* Check wattage against your electrical setup, especially for RVs or outdoor use with limited power.
* Use filtered water to reduce strain on the machine and maintain efficiency.
* Regular maintenance (cleaning, descaling) ensures optimal energy use.

7. Noise Level

Noise varies from 35 dB (HealSmart) to 45–50 dB (GoveeLife), with some models described as “quiet” without specific decibel ratings.

* Quiet Models: HealSmart (35 dB) and COWSAR (<40 dB) are ideal for noise-sensitive environments like offices or small apartments.
* Moderate Noise: Most models produce a hum during operation and louder sounds when ice drops into the bin (e.g., EUHOMY Countertop, Igloo).
* Louder Models: High-output units like the GE Profile may be noticeable in quiet rooms but are not disruptive.

Considerations:

* Place the unit away from living areas if noise is a concern.
* Check user reviews for real-world noise feedback, as manufacturer specs may not always reflect experience.

8. Weather Resistance

For outdoor use, ensure the ice maker is CSA-certified or explicitly designed for outdoor environments.

* Outdoor Models: KitchenAid undercounter models and select freestanding units are built to withstand heat, humidity, and rain.
* Countertop Models: Most (e.g., Kismile, ecozy) are not weather-resistant and should be used indoors or in covered areas.

Considerations:

* Protect non-outdoor units from direct sunlight or moisture to prevent damage.
* Ensure proper drainage for outdoor setups to avoid water pooling.

9. Maintenance

* Self-Cleaning: Most modern models (e.g., Kismile, EUHOMY, Silonn) have a self-cleaning mode, activated by a button press, to flush the system.
* Manual Cleaning: Use vinegar or specialized descaling solutions monthly to prevent mineral buildup, especially in hard water areas.
* Filter Maintenance: If the unit has a filter or TDS meter (e.g., ecozy Smart Nugget), monitor and replace as needed.

Considerations:

* Use filtered or bottled water to minimize scaling and improve ice taste.
* Empty and dry the unit when not in use to prevent mold or odors.

   * Events requiring aesthetic ice (e.g., weddings).
* Examples: Luma Comfort (40 lbs/day, cylindrical).

Installation Considerations

Installing an ice maker depends on its type and features. Here’s a detailed look:

Countertop Ice Makers

* Process: Plug into a 120V outlet, fill the water tank, and start. No plumbing required.
* Tips:
   * Let the unit sit upright for 2–24 hours before first use to allow refrigerant to settle (e.g., ecozy Nugget, Antarctic Star).
   * Run a cleaning cycle with water or vinegar to ensure clean ice.
   * Ensure ventilation space to prevent overheating.
* DIY Feasibility: Very easy; no professional help needed.

Undercounter/Freestanding Ice Makers

* Process: May require a cold water supply line, drain line, and proper ventilation. Some models (e.g., GE Profile Opal 2.0 XL) use a side tank instead of a water line.
* Tips:
   * Check for a nearby water line (1/4-inch copper or PEX tubing is common).
   * Install a floor drain or drain pump for continuous drainage.
   * Professional installation is recommended for plumbing or electrical modifications.
* DIY Feasibility: Possible for those with plumbing experience; otherwise, hire a technician.

General Tips:

* Use a surge protector to protect the unit from power fluctuations.
* For outdoor installations, ensure weatherproof outlets and protection from elements.
* Follow the manufacturer’s manual for model-specific instructions.

Should You Leave Your Ice Maker On All the Time?

Most ice makers are designed for continuous operation to maintain a ready supply of ice.

* Countertop Models: Can be left on, but since storage bins aren’t refrigerated, ice melts and recycles into new ice. Turn off when not in use to save energy and reduce wear (e.g., COWSAR, Silonn).
* Undercounter/Freestanding Models: Built for constant operation, similar to refrigerator ice makers. Smart models (e.g., GE Profile, GoveeLife) allow scheduling to pause production when not needed.
* Considerations:
   * Continuous operation increases energy costs (88–300 W depending on the model).
   * Regular cleaning prevents mold or bacteria growth in always-on units.
   * Drain water and dry the unit if storing for extended periods.

Do Ice Makers Use a Lot of Electricity?

Ice makers are generally energy-efficient for their output, but consumption varies:

* Wattage Range: 15.63 W (EUHOMY Nugget) to 300 W (GE Profile Opal 2.0 XL). Most countertop models use 88–192 W.
* Daily Cost Estimate:
   * At 15 cents/kWh, a 100 W unit running 24 hours uses 2.4 kWh ($0.36/day).
   * A 300 W unit uses 7.2 kWh ($1.08/day).
* Energy-Saving Tips:
   * Choose Energy Star-rated models (more common in undercounter units).
   * Use scheduling features (e.g., GE Profile, ecozy Smart) to run only when needed.
   * Keep the unit in a cool, shaded area to reduce compressor strain.
* Comparison: Ice makers use less electricity than air conditioners or refrigerators but more than small appliances like coffee makers.

Additional Considerations

1. Ice Quality and Water Source

* Filtered Water: Using filtered or bottled water (recommended for ecozy Smart Nugget, EUHOMY) improves ice taste and clarity, reducing mineral buildup.
* TDS Monitoring: Models like the ecozy Smart Nugget include a TDS meter to ensure water quality, preventing cloudy or off-tasting ice.
* Hard Water: In areas with high mineral content, descale monthly to maintain performance.

2. Portability

* Lightweight models (11–15 lbs, e.g., COWSAR, AGLUCKY) with handles are ideal for RVs, camping, or moving between rooms.
* Heavier units (e.g., GE Profile at 38 lbs) are less portable but offer higher capacity.

3. Durability and Warranty

* Stainless steel models (e.g., Newair, Frigidaire) are more durable than plastic ones.
* Check warranty terms (typically 1 year). Extended warranties (e.g., for Igloo) are wise for frequent use.
* Regular maintenance extends lifespan (5–10 years for well-maintained units).

4. Noise Management

* Place on a stable, level surface to minimize vibration noise.
* In quiet settings, opt for low-decibel models (e.g., HealSmart at 35 dB).
* Expect brief loud sounds when ice drops into the bin.

5. Smart Features

* Wi-Fi/App Control: Schedule production, monitor water/ice levels, or receive alerts (e.g., GoveeLife, ecozy Smart Nugget).
* Voice Control: Compatible with Alexa/Google Assistant (e.g., GoveeLife).
* Use Case: Ideal for busy households or those who want ice ready on arrival.

6. Environmental Impact

* Refrigerants: Most modern ice makers use eco-friendly R600a (e.g., Kismile, EUHOMY). Older models may use R134a, which has a higher environmental impact.
* Energy Efficiency: Choose low-wattage or Energy Star models to reduce carbon footprint.
* Recycling: Dispose of old units through certified recycling programs to manage refrigerants safely.

Recommendations by Use Case

* Small Households (1–4 people): COWSAR ($69.99, 26.5 lbs/day, compact), EUHOMY Countertop ($71.24, 26 lbs/day), or Silonn ($77.78, 26 lbs/day) for affordability and sufficient output.
* Frequent Entertainers: Newair (50 lbs/day, $300) or GE Profile Opal 2.0 XL (38 lbs/day, $549) for high capacity and smart features.
* Nugget Ice Enthusiasts: ecozy Smart Nugget ($282.20, 44 lbs/day) or EUHOMY Nugget ($134.94, 34 lbs/day) for chewable ice.
* Premium Drinks: Luma Comfort ($219.85, 40 lbs/day) for clear, slow-melting ice.
* Outdoor Use: KitchenAid undercounter models or CSA-certified units for weather resistance.
* RV/Camping: Igloo ($79.97, portable, 26 lbs/day) or Antarctic Star ($154.99, 34 lbs/day) for lightweight, mobile options.",1,1755010327.0,UsefulThingsOnly,0,1.0,False

As in pooping water and vomiting combo para na akong hihimatayin sa dehydration. Pag uminom ng water seconds after sinusuka ko lang din.   Sobrang sakit pa ng tyan like humihilab every 5 mins. 

Back track the day before, onsite na naman ako. Ang aga aga ko pa kaya nag breakfast ako sa Jollibee. Logganisa egg coffee rice deadma sa keto diet. Ung creamer all in sa kape! During my first break bumili ako ng 1 keto  and 1 non keto bread sa Boulangerie. I ate both while working- cravings is life!  Lunch may baon ako na adlai rice, salmon tuna sisig (yes ako ang nagluto! Yes masarap) at homemade fried chicken. After lunch namigay ng Jollibee super meal ung people lead ko. Chicken, burger steak, spaghetti,  rice burger. Ung burger and rice pinamigay ko pero the rest kinain ko while I was working. Basically buong shift ko wala na akong ginawa kundi kumain!

Pag uwi sa bahay may chicharon bulaklak! Sabi ko busog pa so tiny piece lang pero charot lang. By 8pm preparing to sleep pero ang sama na ng tyan ko. Around 12 midnight mga 5times na ako nyan pabalikbalik sa cr and around 1 pm nag susuka na din. Wala na ako nagawa, persistent na ang family kaya ayun nagpahatid na ako sa hospital near us. 

Covered naman ng HMO pero local small private hospital lang ito sa bayan namin. Walang wheelchair pero keri kaya ko naman maglakad. Nasa ER bed ako ung companion ko nasa monoblock chair lang (love you fam!) 1 cr lang sa ER. Medjo malinis naman pero pag may nauna goodluck sobrang sakit pa naman ng tyan! Test bloodwork... boom ang taas daw ng infection ko sa blood so need mag antibiotics for 7 days, at madami pang ibang meds. May pain reliever, gamot sa pagsusuka, may vial na lactobacillus, pang hydrate at pampatigas ng poop. That 2,500 pesos worth of medicine! Diagnosis daw is acute gastroenteritis and dehydration. Hindi naman kami nagtagal sa hospital dumating around 2am around 6am sabi samin pwede na umuwi.

At least hindi ako nahimatay! Kahit paminsan minsan sumasakit pa din ang tyan ok lang naman na totolerate ko once nga lang ako uminom ng pain reliever. Ayoko naman nagpapabebe ako pa nga nag drive pabalik ng hospital kaninang hapon to get my medical certificate. Nag mall pa after nag hanap ulet ng masarap wala naman nabili siomai, chicken and donut lang naman. Keto? Kinalimutan ko muna deserve ko naman kumain ng masarap after ma ER! 

Moral lesson: wag ng kumain pag busog pa naman. Wag pagsabayin ang Jollibee, bread, adlai rice, sisig, chicken, and coffeee kung away mong magpapalik balik sa CR and trip to the ER.",1,1755010202.0,u_JYJnette0201,0,1.0,False

Since I hadn’t had a haircut for 12 months, I moved some work commitments and booked an appointment at the local clinic at 9am, I had an important and confidential phone call to take at 9:30 so I was hoping to get a very quick trim in 30 minutes. On the day, I showed up at 8:45 so I could be waiting when they opened. The hairdresser was 5 min late to open (9:05) but no big deal I thought. So I immediately explained that I just wanted split ends cut off, not worried about shape since its really long, and no need to wash it (I had washed before coming) or style it as I needed to be out by 9:30 or step out for a 5-10 min call but would still pay for full service. She was unhappy and said she couldn’t guarantee that she would be done by then and if I walked out to take the 5-10 min call then she wouldn’t finish the job and it would be left half cut. I agreed to proceed since I thought how long can it take to cut some split ends… She took ages to even get started. She went to make herself a coffee, her friend came in with flowers for her birthday and she spent ages chatting with her friend, and it was 9:23 before she even started cutting. At 9:28 I said it looked fine and to leave it as I had to pay and leave, but she kept saying she was almost done and not stopping trimming little bits here and there, so I had missed the call. I then was trying to rush out at 9:40 to call back and she said she would ask the manager about a discount since I didn’t get it stuled. At this point I was a little frustrated and said please please please just put it through and let me pay. I was complaining to my family about how she wasted 20+ minutes of the appointment time and even wasted more time about the discount when I had already said I would pay extra to get out faster, but they all said I was TAH for such a stupid request.

Here is your chance to get a boost, but with the good comes the bad, because being on the fringes isn't always great.  Would you pick any of these, knowing the drawbacks?

Strength.  The average person can access on a normal day, about 30-40% of their actual strength.  Meaning you are roughly 2 1/2 to 3 times stronger than you think you are.  Right off the bat, this is doubled on the low end for you, so you can access 60% of your strength without serious effort.  You are significantly stronger than you look, & with very little effort you can access up to the very limit of your body's capacity.  Sounds great at first, but here's the downside: your body isn't anymore resistant to injury than it was before.  Part of the reason those limits exist is to prevent you from damaging your bones, ligaments, muscles, etc.  Instead of it working by instinct, you'll have to pay close attention to the world around you.  Everything will seem significantly more flimsy & it will seem like everything is more prone to breaking than you expect.  

Dexterity.  Ultrafast reflexes, great eye-hand coordination, even just clapping to the beat.  You can do it all.  It's like instinct for you.  Well, not like instinct, it is instinct.  Your body reacts faster than your mind, so you don't get to decide if you dodge left or right, your lizard brain will make that choice for you.  Someone tosses you a non-proverbial hot potato, you'll catch it without thinking.  Same goes for mugs full of hot coffee that fall, knives that drop, etc.  You will react, but not always the way you want to. 

Constitution.  You're a survivor.  You can endure things that would make a normal person give up on existence.  It's comfortable for you to wear shorts in the winter, you walk barefoot on asphalt when it's 108 outside.  Sunscreen is for people who like goop on their skin, not you.  Gas station sushi & chili dogs are nothing to worry about.  Beer before liquor?  Don't be a wuss, you'll be fine.  The thing is, survival is half mental, so you are not immune to anything, you just have the fortitude to endure.  When you do get hurt you heal, but it's not always going to be 100%.  Injuries & the pain that comes from them still accumulate.  You will probably die of very old age, but you will want to go much sooner than that.

Intelligence.  You're the smartest person in the room by far.  Not just regular genius, you're truly brilliant.  Multi-lingual, math, science, biology, you name it, you know it.  You are able to discuss anything with anyone, on the highest level.  Mind bending paradoxes are like basic coloring books to you.  You don't sleep well because you can't turn your mind off.  You don't have a lot of people you consider friends because almost no one is on your level.  Conversations are easy for you but they play out in slow motion.  People call you a know-it-all (but hey, you really do!)  The biggest challenge is just getting through another boring day.  You knew what was going on in the sixth sense 15 minutes into the movie.  There are few surprises in life.  

Wisdom.  Solomon picked this one, but I'm not sure how well that worked out for him.  You'll always know what's best.  You can predict the outcome of things based on vibes & subconscious hints that are beyond anyone else's radar.  But knowing the best course of action & being able to put it into action are not always the same thing.  You want to help people, & you give them the best advice possible, but few if any listen.  Whether it's unsolicited or not, even when people ask for help, they will often ignore your instructions.  It will be like watching a 5 year old trying to bake a cake from scratch without a recipe, & you can't really intervein to save them from themselves.  You'll know when a relationship has run it's course, but you won't be immune from the heartache.   

Charisma.  Hey there Gorgeous.  When you walk into a room, everything pauses for a few seconds.  You're the best looking person in the room by far.  Anyone you approach will drop whatever they are doing to talk to you.  You can really have almost anyone you want.  Doors open for you like when you walk into a Walmart, it's automatic.  People walk into stuff as you go by.  You have a million friends and ten million followers.  True friends are rare.  Anyone you date will be insanely jealous of your time & attention.  Deep connections will be hard to come by, it's loneliness while being surrounded by people.

1moaqix,https://www.reddit.com/r/FATSafari/comments/1m7hl8q/beyond_africa_adventure/,&Beyond Africa Adventure,"Hi all,

Longtime lurker, first-time poster—back from our honeymoon and finally here to deliver the full report. We traveled through Southern Africa with **&Beyond**, staying at four of their properties. TL;DR: the entire experience was very well executed, beautiful, and worth every dollar.

Here’s the breakdown.

* **Days 1–5:** &Beyond Benguerra Island, Mozambique
* **Days 6–7:** &Beyond Nxabega Okavango Tented Camp, Botswana
* **Days 8–10:** &Beyond Sandibe Okavango Safari Lodge, Botswana
* **Days 11–13:** &Beyond Sossusvlei Desert Lodge, Namibia

This was booked as a custom itinerary through &Beyond’s travel team, including bush flights, transfers, and all internal logistics. Seamless from start to finish.

***Benguerra Island***

Our trip began with five nights on Benguerra Island — and honestly, we could have stayed forever. In fact, we’ve already decided to return next year. The highlight of our stay was undoubtedly our butler, Helder. I can’t say enough about him, he truly made the entire experience exceptional.

We arrived by helicopter after flying into Villanculos. There were six of us in the chopper, with one couple dropped off at another resort (possibly Kisawa or Anantara). The aerial arrival was a spectacular way to kick off our stay.

**Accommodation:**  
We stayed in a Cabana, though our travel agent had originally booked us in a Casinha. We ultimately felt the upgrade wasn’t necessary — both options seem wonderful, and I don’t think choosing one over the other would significantly impact your experience. My husband had specifically wanted a private plunge pool, but in the end, we didn’t use it once. What really stood out was the direct beach access from our room. The ocean was the perfect temperature this time of year, and we spent hours relaxing on the deck — the outdoor furniture was exceptionally comfortable.

**Service & Activities:**  
Helder was simply top-notch, thoughtful, kind, funny, and attentive. We got to know him quite well, and he even taught us how to play *Mbao*, a traditional local game. Each room has a game board, and I *highly* recommend learning how to play it’s so fun, we bought two carved wood boards to bring home.

Beyond Helder, the entire staff was warm, gracious, and professional. Each evening at dinner, the activities coordinator would come by our table to help us plan the next day. Here’s what we did:

* **Island Tour & Dune Walk:** There are two versions — a short tour and a more in-depth one. We did the full version, which provided great insight into the island and the investments being made by the company. The massive dune walk on the far side of the island was a highlight, with views of a freshwater lake home to flamingos and even crocodiles. Very cool.
* **Snorkeling:** My Australian husband, who has snorkeled extensively across the Pacific, said it was the best he’s ever experienced.
* **Swimming with Horses:** You can choose between a short and long version. We opted for the short one, which involved walking along the beach with the horses. It was lovely. The woman running the horse program was knowledgeable and clearly passionate. The long version covers more of their property of the island, it's more of a tour on horseback.
* **Massage:** Irene (the masseuse) was absolutely phenomenal, easily a 15/10. One of the best massages I’ve ever had.
* **Castaway Picnic:** We took a 25-minute boat ride out to a remote sandbar where they had arranged a beautifully presented 3-course meal, complete with our favorite wines from the week — a thoughtful touch. We spent a few hours there; it was magical.

**Food:**  
The food was outstanding, the best of the four properties we visited on this trip. Helder would ask where we’d like to eat each day and arranged everything, whether it was poolside, on the beach, or on our private deck. Each setup was beautifully done. The cuisine was familiar yet refined, not overly fancy, but every dish was prepared to perfection. The wine selection (all African) was impressive, with something for everyone.

***Nxabega Tented Camp***

We arrived at Nxabega via a short 30-minute flight from Maun, with one stop along the way to pick up guests and staff from another camp. When we landed, we disembarked alongside another couple who ended up becoming our fast friends, they were absolutely lovely!

One thing to note about &Beyond: you’re typically grouped for game drives with the guests you arrive with. Luckily for us, we really hit it off with our pair. By coincidence, they were doing the inverse of our itinerary — three nights at Nxabega and two at Sandibe — so we were able to reconnect at Sandibe later on. We asked to be paired with them again, and the team accommodated our request without hesitation. A small detail, but such a meaningful one.

**Accommodation:**  
The tents at Nxabega are stunning. While someone did mention they could use a light refresh, it in no way detracted from the beauty or comfort of the space. The beds were incredibly comfortable, and each night we returned to find a hot water bottle tucked in, such a thoughtful and cozy touch.

**Service & Activities:**  
The service at Nxabega is personal and warm, less polished than Benguerra, but in a way that felt right for a safari camp. Our butler, Kay, was friendly and attentive. It’s worth noting that the butlers here don't serve in quite the same hands-on role as they do at Benguerra, a distinction they explain upon arrival.

Even the transfer from the airstrip to the lodge felt like a mini game drive, a perfect introduction to Botswana. We arrived around 3:30 PM, had a quick tea, and by 4 PM were out on our first drive.

Our guide, LK, and our tracker, Ellie, were phenomenal, full of personality, fun banter, and deep knowledge. They had all the answers to all the questions. They made every drive feel like an adventure with friends. Nxabega is one of the few camps in the area with water deep enough for aquatic activities, which set it apart from Sandibe.

We opted for the Mokoro (traditional dugout canoe) experience, and it was beautifully serene until we ran into a young elephant bull who wanted to make sure we knew he was tough. It gave me quite the fright, but our Mekoro captain was so unphased. Upon returning to shore, the staff surprised us with a full gin bar (six varieties!) and snacks, knowing we were gin & tonic fans. It was such a thoughtful, customized touch.

The game drives themselves were everything we hoped for. I won’t wax poetic about the Okavango Delta — if you’re considering it, you likely already know how magical it is. But just to give a sense of the rhythm:

* Wake-up call at 5:30 AM
* Coffee delivered to your tent at 6 (you pre-order your preferences the night before)
* Breakfast at 6:30
* Game drive begins at 7
* Mid-morning coffee/snack break around 11 (don’t skip the Amarula in your coffee! it's the African version of Bailey's)
* Return to camp for lunch at 12
* Afternoon tea at 3
* Second drive begins at 4
* Sundowner stop with cocktails and snacks
* Dinner served after returning to camp
* Then, off to bed

The schedule strikes a perfect balance between activity and rest, but can be grueling.

**Food:**  
Our first night featured a lively outdoor cookout with all the guests, a mix of local dishes and grilled favorites. It was a wonderful setting, though I found some dishes weren’t as hot as I’d prefer, likely a side effect of everyone socializing before sitting down.

Overall, the food at Nxabega was a bit hit or miss for me. The lunches were consistently excellent, always fresh, flavorful, and well-executed. Dinners, on the other hand, sometimes fell a little flat.That said, our second night dinner, a private meal arranged by the pool for just the four of us (as we were the only remaining guests that night) — was more about the company than the cuisine. The food wasn’t great, but the conversation and atmosphere made it a wonderful evening.

***Sandibe Safari Lodge***

After 2 nights we transferred from Nxabega to Sandibe. Sandibe is the preview Okavango Delta camp and when you arrive you can see why. Architecturally in the shape of a pangolin (which we did not get to stop while on our drives), it is very well done. Ultra-luxe but still down-to-earth. It’s hard to describe how next-level this place feels—it walks the line between modern design and immersive nature perfectly. As we were there, the region was starting to get water. Each day there was more and more water. It was amazing! I will say, I preferred the tented camp feel to the luxe lodge, but I still loved it!

The drive to the camp from the airstrip is much much longer at Nxabega (15 mins) than Sandibe where it is about 40 minutes. On this drive we saw many things we didn't get to see at Nxabega. It was amazing!

**Accommodation:**

The rooms are spectacular. So well constructed. Great attention to detail. I need not say anything else. It's all so beautiful.

**Service and Activities:**

Our guide, Bob and tracker, LK were amazing men. We invited them to dine with us on the second night and we we learned so much about them, and Botswana. The staff here has the most amazing working relationship. There were so many moments where I wanted to be included in the fun and jokes! It made me happy to see everyone enjoying themselves at work. Naomi our butler served in the same capacity as our butler, Kay, did at Nxabega. She was so beautiful in and out. I could not get enough of her. The schedule for drives is the same at Sandibe as at Nxabega.

**Food**:

I enjoyed the food here. Sandibe has an interactive kitchen so on the second day we were able to make customized pizzas which was a fun little touch. Dinners were tasty, despite being on the smaller size. I often found that I wanted more food. I wasn't starving at the end, but I could hav eaten more.

***Sossusvlei Desert Lodge***

We ended our trip with three nights at Sossusvlei Desert Lodge, a surreal, almost otherworldly retreat deep in the Namibian desert. It truly felt like an oasis in the middle of nowhere.

After leaving Botswana, we flew into Namibia and spent one night in Windhoek at a charming hotel. For dinner, we walked across the street to a steakhouse, unbelievably affordable and shockingly good. The next morning, we took a short one-hour flight out to the lodge.

The lodge is truly remote. We arrived with another couple who, unfortunately, weren’t our cup of tea. It was a bit of a letdown, especially after the great connection we had with the couple from our previous stop. That said, we didn’t let it affect our experience, and we certainly don’t hold &Beyond responsible for guest pairings.

On our final day, we were scheduled to transfer to Walvis Bay for a quad-bike tour to see where the Atlantic Ocean meets the towering sand dunes — something we’d been very excited about, it was also where we were needing to grab a flight from to the back to Johannesburg to get home. But nature had other plans: a torrential downpour grounded all flights. Instead, we endured a very bumpy five-hour ground transfer. Sadly, we missed the tour and didn’t get to see much of Walvis Bay.

Ironically, the rain cleared later that day, and it turned into the most breathtaking afternoon. Still, by then, all transfers had already been rerouted to ground travel, even for guests arriving that evening. It was a logistical hiccup, but unavoidable.

**Accommodation:**  
The rooms here are absolutely spectacular, each one an architectural masterpiece, designed with impeccable taste and no expense spared. While the main lodge area is elegant and beautifully designed, the private suites are truly next-level. Ours was the furthest from the main lodge, which we actually appreciated for the added privacy. It became clear to us that the true luxury you're paying for at Sossusvlei is the space, design, and setting.

**Service & Activities:**  
Our favorite part of the lodge experience was Doreen, the manager. She was warm, professional, and HILARIOUS — one of the best we encountered on the entire trip. I could rave about her for days.

That said, there was one off-putting moment: after Doreen’s lovely check-in, we sat down with the activities coordinator — and the vibe shifted. She was very salesy, pushing extra-cost activities in a way that felt awkward and out of place. She even made multiple jokes about upselling, which didn’t land well. When you’re staying at a property of this caliber, you don’t expect to feel like you’re being pitched — it cheapened the moment and didn’t reflect the rest of the experience.

Here are the activities we did:

* Game Drive near the Dunes: A scenic and relaxing drive capped with sundowners and snacks — very enjoyable.
* Big Daddy Dune Hike: My husband tackled the massive dune while I opted out (it’s a 90-minute drive each way). The dune sits inside a busy national park, so expect lots of tourists, but he said the experience was well worth it — challenging, but rewarding according to him
* ATV Dune Ride: SO. MUCH. FUN. Easily one of the highlights of our time at the lodge.
* Spa Experience: We did a full-body scrub and massage in a shared treatment room. I’d give mine an 8/10; my husband rated his a 5/10, seems like I lucked out with the better therapist.
* Stargazing with the In-House Astronomer: A nice experience overall. The astronomer was knowledgeable and pleasant, but we both felt his delivery was a bit too technical right off the bat. We'd have preferred a more engaging, beginner-friendly approach | someone with a Bill Nye or Steve Irwin energy to make it more accessible and exciting.

Our guide, KK, was great, warm, funny, and full of energy. He added a lot to the overall experience.

If you're on the fence about &Beyond or considering a multi-lodge African itinerary, I wouldn’t hesitate. They nailed every aspect.

1moapzt,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_britneyknows888/comments/1moapzt/best_noise_cancelling_earbuds_that_actually_block/,Best noise cancelling earbuds that actually block out noise,"I get overwhelmed in loud places - open offices that buzz like beehives, crowded flights where the engine hum never stops, even coffee shops where one loud laugh feels like it echoes inside my head.

I’ve tried more earbuds than I care to admit, chasing that rare mix of comfort, great sound, and noise cancelling that actually feels like a *pause button for the world*. These three finally made the cut - each for their own reason.

**1️⃣** [**Apple AirPods Pro 2**](https://www.marketexposer.com/gp/earbuds/B0D1XD1ZV3) **– my safe little bubble**  
On planes, these noise cancelling earbuds turn the roar into a soft, steady whisper. In coffee shops, that table of people talking over each other just melts into the background. Transparency mode feels almost unreal - like stepping from a quiet library into the real world in an instant. They fit so naturally I forget they’re there, even hours later.

**Pros:**

* Active noise control that genuinely takes the edge off the world
* Effortless switch between silence and awareness
* So light you forget you’re wearing them

**Cons:**

* Pricey
* 5–6 hours battery before recharging in the case

**2️⃣** [**Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro**](https://www.marketexposer.com/dp/earbuds/B0D9C8VNSN) **– warm and immersive (cheaper option)**  
These noise cancelling earbuds don’t just play music - they wrap it around you like a cozy blanket(Am I too emotional haha). The noise cancelling is strong enough to keep me focused, but their warmer sound makes even background listening feel special. They’re snug without feeling crammed in.

**Pros:**

* Great active noise control for the cost
* Warm, rich sound
* Very comfortable, especially for smaller ears

**Cons:**

* Touch controls can be a bit too reactive
* Case picks up scratches easily

**3️⃣** [**Soundcore Sport X20 by Anker**](https://www.marketexposer.com/dp/earbuds/B0CRT6HQ82) **– the unshakable workout buddy**  
Running, jumping, sweating - these noise cancelling earbuds don’t budge. They’ve been through rain, gym sessions, and sprints, and they’re still as secure as the moment I put them in. The active noise control softens gym noise but keeps me aware enough to feel safe outdoors.

**Pros:**

* Rock-solid fit during any movement
* Sweat and rain resistant
* Long battery life — I lose track of when I last charged them

**Cons:**

* Active noise control isn’t as strong as the first two
* Sound is good but lacks the depth of pricier models

**If I had to pick just one?**  
AirPods Pro 2 — for that everyday sense of peace that’s worth every cent.  
For a close second at a better price, Galaxy Buds 3 Pro.

That sentence changed how I look at every single day. I still have hard moments, but I stopped wasting time on a lot of noise. Maybe this helps you, too.

1. Worrying about tiny annoyances. (Traffic, coffee spills, life’s bigger than hiccups.)
2. People-pleasing at the cost of my peace.
3. Holding grudges, they only weigh me down.
4. Trying to be perfect. Imperfect is real. Imperfect is alive.
5. Saving things “for best.” Use the good plate. Wear the shoes. Take the trip.
6. Apologizing for needing rest. Rest is not a luxury, it’s survival.
7. Staying in relationships that drain me. Energy matters.
8. Comparing my behind-the-scenes to someone else’s highlight reel.
9. Saying “I’ll do it later” to things that actually matter.
10. Chasing approval from strangers online. Likes don’t warm you at 3 AM.
11. Fearing vulnerability, it’s the bridge to real connection.
12. Hoarding things I don’t use. Less stuff, more breath.
13. Postponing checkups or self-care because I’m “too busy.” (Just do the basics.)
14. Being ashamed of tears. Tears mean you’re still feeling. That’s okay.
15. Letting small arguments define a day or a week. Let it go sooner.
16. Letting fear decide my plans. Try the thing; adjust as you go.
17. Pretending to be fine when I’m not. Honesty saves time and energy.
18. Obsessing over an unreachable “future me.” Live with the person you are now.
19. Worrying about my legacy like it’s for strangers, live well for the people you love and for the life you have.

If cancer taught me anything, it’s that time is the only currency that truly matters. Spend it on people who make you laugh, projects that light you up, and small daily peace.

There's a few things which I wish someone had explained to me. It's really a shame, until you use a bag for awhile, you don't know if it will be useful or the opposite. 

Synik 30 has no side pockets for a water bottle. I have lost all the water bottles I had in the last month, and a coffee cup. I didn't think it would be a big deal. It is! When you put a water bottle in the front pockets, it takes up an obscene amount of space inside the bag and doesn't fit well, plus it's painful to have hard things in the pockets when it's really full because it makes the bag press into your back. 

I had to remove the back support plate because the lumbar area is curved in the wrong place for anyone under 6 feet tall. So, then the bag loses a lot of support. Most non-hiking bags that come with a backboard like that are designed to have it be removable. It really affects the Synik's volume and stability. The 'laptop compartment' without the backboard is basically just a cloth pocket, with ZERO padding on the inside of the bag, just a mesh net holding your laptop in there. And if you have a small laptop, it will just move around constantly. 

Anything but clothing in the main compartment squishes the bag into a barrel type shape that is not comfortable. There are no pockets, divisions or structures in the main compartment and the zips open up all the way. Things easily fall out or become very jumbled if you try to quickly access the bag. I don't find it convenient to pack flat. If I wanted to use a suitcase, I would. 

Bottom line: I'd be less mad and I would have some good things to say if the bag did not cost so much and then cost me more money by not having common features that all bags have. It's marketed as a backpack for multi-use but, for me, this is counterproductive unless I am going on a hike or a Ryan air flight. Not good for everyday use. 

Do not get if: 

\- You are short

\- You need to carry work things and not just clothing

1moajqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1moajqo/dry_buns/,Dry Buns,"The counter was a mess. Protein wrappers thrown about with empty restaurant ketchup packets mixed in. The barely noticeable hum of the fridge filled the silence. I was in the middle of packing snacks and drinks for my big road trip to Grand Rapids. It was that time of year again – time to qualify for The Nathan's Hot Dog Eating contest. This time, I was going to show the world that you don’t need to dip your buns into gross water. It hadn’t worked yet, but now that my YouTube was blowing up, all the thoughts and prayers of my adoring fans were going to carry me to success. Even though my parents would never agree, all they would do is belittle my achievements. Today was no exception. My parents started laying into me as soon as. The sun was still trying to greet us. My Dad sat at the kitchen table, drinking his black coffee with a thousand-yard stare. My Mom sat across from him. I could tell that something was on their mind, but I was in competition mode, and I wasn’t having any of it. I was wearing my favorite “I’m a dry guy” tank top merch. Always advertise yourself, kids, remember! 



My Dad, already agitated by my existence, had a side of laying into me with his coffee: “Percival, where the hell are you going?” I didn’t even make eye contact and continued with what I was doing, “It’s Percy now! And I’m off to Grand Rapids. I have the biggest hot dog competition of my life to qualify for.” My Dad’s head sank as he stared deeper into his coffee, contemplating that vasectomy he never got. “You’re damn near 40! Seek employment. I mean, for God's sake, look at you! You’re overweight, not a girl in sight. When I was your age, I had it all figured out. Hell, by the time I was 24, I had my career, a wife, and a kid on the way!” I scoffed, “No girl in sight, huh? I’ll have you know that last week, I had a girl comment on my video. “Damn, look at that meat mountain! I’d love to take a ride!” I have 25k subscribers by the way.” I thought that would immediately shut him down; it didn’t. “She was talking about the meat you were eating, you dumbass! It was a brisket challenge!” I smirked, “So you DO watch my videos.” He relinquished, but only a little “It was probably a dude anyway.” He muttered. 



“Listen,” I said, “I’m THIS close to taking the mustard belt from Reggie “left no” Crumm! I was only 30 hot dogs away last year. I know he’s shaking in his Crocs at the mere thought of having to compete against me! Once I beat him, all the advertisers will flock to me. You’ll see.” My Mom, who had stayed quiet all the while, finally had some input into the conversation: “We believe in you, and are so proud of what you’ve accomplished. But Percy, you have to be reasonable. You refuse to dip your hot dog buns in water; there is just no way that you can win.” I could tell it took a lot for her to say, “We just want you to be able to live once we’re gone.” I looked directly at her, fuming, “How dare you….” “Sweetie, I-” I shut her down. “No! You know that I’m traumatized by wet bread!” My Dad let out a big sigh, “Here we go again…” I broke into the story, “I was in 3rd grade. A normal lunch. As it always was. A nice tuna sandwich, my favorite. Warm, soft white bread, holding the perfect amount of creamy tuna salad. Crispy celery nestled between the fish, playfully notifying me that they were there with every crunch between my teeth. Fresh, juicy lettuce giving it an extra crunch. The mayo, so rich, mixed in with the tuna ever so perfectly. But on that dreadful day. A bit of milk was spilled onto the table. I was blissfully unaware, as I unknowingly took a bite out of that mushy, milk-infested bread. The world that I knew ceased to exist. The vomit was automatic; violent, uncontrollable. Almost as if it had a mind of its own. From that day, I was an outcast. Unceremoniously given the nickname soggy bun boy, and the less clever name of puke. PUKE! Thrown to the side by so-called friends, as if I were just a piece of garbage. It was the most disgusting, life-changing experience of my life.” My parents weren’t paying attention anymore; they’d heard it before. “So no, I will not be dipping any bread into water. I believe that’s cheating. If you can’t swallow bread through natural saliva, then you aren’t good enough. And that’s why I have to take down Reggie Crumm.” I could see the sadness in her eyes, but there was no time for that. A knock on the door made another groan force its way out of my father's mouth. “I told you to keep that freak away from our house.” 



The door swung open, and in walked my cameraman, Travis “Sup Big P.” His flip-flops slapping on our kitchen floor echoed off the walls, as his Hawaiian shirt fluttered in the breeze. He held a tripod in one hand, his vlog camera filming already in the other. “Destiny awaits!” I turned my back to my parents like a gladiator about to enter the arena, nodded to Travis and looked back over my shoulder. “It’s time I bid thy farewell, parents. No tears; I will return a legend!” My Dad mumbled something I couldn’t hear, as my Mom came over and gave me a big hug, and a bag of premade snacks. I know this was just her trying to give some sort of peace offering, it’s not like she didn’t know I had already filled my dufflebag to the brim with snacks myself. Travis, on the other hand, never as prepared as I, accepted it gleefully. With that, we were on our way on our journey to Grand Rapids for my date with some hot dogs, and a little side of destiny. All through the journey, I couldn’t get that mustard belt, or Reggie “Left No” Crumm out of my head. It was my time to shine. 



Lucky for me, the competition was easy as hell. I sucked down all those dogs like a Dyson vacuum, and not an ounce of water was used. Sure, I didn’t break any records, but I didn’t need to break any records this time around. That was never the goal. As long as I had qualified for the Nathans Hot Dog Eating contest, I had a chance at that smug son of a bitch, Reggie Crumm. The huge crowd of 5 people that watched me, the true Michael Jordan of Major League Eating, popped with excitement for the star in their midst. In that moment, I knew I was a food-eating god. And these were my disciples. Step 1? Yeah, complete. Not that it was ever in question. Everything was going according to plan. The drive back, I was feeling great, and we didn’t even notice that the gas was hovering close to E. I just played the footage of me dominating the competition over and over again on a loop. Not a wet bun in the house, and not a dry eye! Travis fortunately noticed the gas gauge and stopped immediately at a gas station as soon as he did. As Travis was filling the tank, I noticed that mine was already full. “Hey,” I said, getting out of the car, “Gotta push piss out of my dick and balls.” Travis didn’t understand my humor all the time. Nobody did; clearly my humor was a bit too sophisticated for some. 



“Oh… Ok.” I paid no attention to him; I made my way to the bathroom and took care of the piss in my bladder. T’was a glorious wizz, a winner's wizz, but what wasn’t glorious was the giant banner of Reggie hovering over my head once I left the restroom. “You know he’s a cheater, right?” I caught the cashier off guard; he didn’t even see it coming. He never expected anyone to call him out on his shit. “You know you support communism, right? By having Reggie “left no” Crumm up in your store? Yeah, the fact he has to wet his buns to HELP him win… Ridiculous. You should be ashamed.” I left him speechless. He’s a coward who couldn’t defend his decisions in life. I just left him standing there, awestruck that someone could be so badass. I smirked and left the gas station with my head held high. I gave him a little tip of my hat as I walked away. Another win for me. Travis was already in the car. “Ready, man?” I pulled my shades out and slid them right over my eyes. I didn’t even need to look at him; he already knew “I’m always ready.” He pressed on the gas, and we were on our way back home. Not too long after we started the drive, he started a conversation. Weird, he normally would just let me talk; I wasn’t a fan of his voice, and yet he insisted on using it in this moment. “Hey, have you heard about that up-and-comer? Caleb Duncan? Seems to be some new guy, and some real competition.” I scoffed at such a ridiculous statement, “Is he a dipper? Or one of the good ones?” He glanced over at me; he never enjoyed my terminology on things. “He dips his buns. I’m just saying you should watch out for him, too. He could be competition for Reggie and you.” I just rolled my eyes and turned up the music really loud to drown him out. I cranked Darude’s Sandstorm real loud; he got the hint. 



Three weeks later, there I was, off to the side of the stage with a camera shoved in my face. The announcer had his drawn-out introductions for everyone, and it was killing me. I was just ready to get up on that stage and destroy the legacy of Reggie. To be honest, though, the introduction for me was NOT up to the level that I deserved. He didn’t even mention my YouTube channel or the number of subscribers I have. Amateur. I shook it off like the boss I am, as I wasn’t going to let this clear attempt at sabotage get to me. I didn’t even acknowledge the sheep, aka the crowd, and made my way right next to Reggie. Sure, I wasn’t scheduled to be standing next to him, but I wasn’t going to be denied. I pushed Earnest Thompson out of the way. He wasn’t beating him, that’s for sure, and I know ESPN’s oversight would’ve been detrimental to the show itself. You’re welcome, corporate shills. It was my time to shine, and they weren’t going to take that from me. If I were going to do this, I was going to do it right in the face of Reggie. The hot dogs were hot, and I could smell the aroma fill my nostrils. But then, they put the water cups down. “Pfffft.” I snickered to myself, I had to make it known what I’m all about. I pushed all those water cups down off the table, and it got a rise from the crowd. I pointed to my “I’m a dry guy” t-shirt, making sure everyone knew who they were dealing with. I was no poser, and I wouldn’t be anywhere near any water cups. That shit was for cheaters, and I wasn’t going to partake in any of that. I stared Reggie right in the eyes, or I would’ve been if he turned his head, but I told him right to the side of his face. “Your empire of wieners comes crashing down tonight.” He ignored me; he was too scared to face the reality that he was in.



 Then, everyone was ready, and another smirk made its way on my face. “It’s dry time” I said, thinking that I could make it my slogan. The buzzer went off, and I started stuffing my face. Everything was going smoothly. 1 dog, 1 bun, 2 dogs, 2 buns. I got to 11 and was in front of Reggie by .5. Then, something got caught in my throat. A bun. A dry bun. It just wouldn’t go down. Out of instinct, I reached for a water cup, but they were absent. I wasn’t going to take Earnest's or Reggie's water. There is no way I would give them THAT satisfaction. I would simply just cough it out, as a true dry dog champion would. But as the time kept moving, the chance for me to launch the bun out of my throat became less and less. I could already hear it now, “he’s no throat GOAT” and it irked me greatly. I could feel my throat clogged, the air impossible to escape. And before I knew it, the sound of the crowd faded, and I was falling face first into the hot weiners laid in front of me. The shine of the mustard belt gleamed arrogantly into my eyes as it was the last thing I saw before everything faded away. The dream died, and so did I. I quite literally choked the moment. 



When my eyes opened, I wasn’t looking up; I was looking down. I watched as the EMTs briskly whisked me away off stage; my arms dangling limply, hot dog juice all over my face. I hovered above, watching, knowing that it was over. The announcer’s voice boomed over the PA, “Looks like Percy is going to have a hard time gaining on Reggie's overwhelming lead now! As he seems to be getting carried away!” The crowd roared in laughter, and nobody looked concerned. No one looked in my direction at all. No one even noticed the severity of what was happening. I just died on stage to the laughter of thousands. My cameraman came running on stage, I thought it was to come to my side, but no. He just wanted a better look at Reggie’s dominance.  I was gone, except I wasn’t. As the final buzzer sounded, the PA came to announce, “With a personal record of 61 hot dogs! The winner of the 2030 Nathan’s Hot Dog Eating Contest… REGGIE “LEFT NO” CRUMM!!” The confetti rained down from seemingly God himself, and the music boomed loudly. My lifeless body hit the ambulance doors and vanished inside. All eyes were on Reggie — and I was already fading into nothing.



I looked around. Saw everyone applauding, except one guy. I barely knew who he was as he was new to the circuit. I think Travis might’ve been yapping about him earlier. His name was Caleb Duncan, and I just noticed that he had only lost by 5 hot dogs. The kid had potential. And he did not just bend the knee to that douche Reggie; he earned some brownie points. If only he could ditch the wet, gross buns. That’s when my brain hatched an idea. It doesn’t have to end like this. Since I’m a ghost, I should start thinking like a ghost. “Quick! What would a ghost do in this situation? Sulk? Haunt? Ooooh… I’m gonna possess him.” I wiggled my new ghostly body like I’d been dead for years, just hovering there behind him. How do I do this? I started by just putting my hand through him. I saw as his body tensed and he whipped his head around, feeling a presence. I could tell he felt a cold shiver down his spine; it was my hand. But I wasn’t in him. I couldn’t control him. This shit was hard. I tried dipping a toe in, and then both legs, trying to control his movements. Nothing. I flew up as high as I could go and gave him a “Macho Man” Randy Savage elbow drop from the top rope. I flew right through and wound up under the stage. I stood there, right in front of his face, frustrated. 



I sighed, hovering under the stage. Then Caleb sneezed. One big, glorious sneeze — and just like that, I was sucked in. I don’t know why that’s how it works, but apparently it is. Who knew covering your mouth was to protect from ghost possession and not only germs? 



But possession wasn’t an instant takeover. Nope. I got a twitch here, a weird arm flail there. Caleb was *very* confused, and so was I. Still, it was a start. I wasn’t making much leeway. I was in his body, but didn’t have much control. He was still just having random muscle spasms and couldn’t figure out how to take over his brain or gain full control of his body movements. Like, sometimes I could hijack conversations, but what I was saying wouldn’t be used all the time. Just random, sporadic words here and there that wouldn’t make any sense in the conversation. I guess possession is a slow process. A few weeks passed before he noticed I was there. He was watching some bullshit show about cars; boring as shit, and I let it be known. “Bro, why do you watch this shit? It’s so boring.” He shot up from the couch, looking around. “Who- Who’s there? I warn you, I have a gun!” I was shocked, “You can hear me?” Caleb got a book off the coffee table and brandished it as a weapon. “Just leave, and I won’t call the cops!” I rolled my eyes in annoyance, but it wound up rolling his eyes. “Fuck! Damn muscle spasms.” I was in shock; it was working. “Chill out, it’s not like you can do anything anyway.” He slowly raised his hand to his head. “A-are you inside me? I can hear you, but… You’re like in my head?” “Nothing gets by you, does it, asshole?” He was panicking, I could tell. “But how? Who are you? What’s happening?” I sat him down on the ground. “I possessed you. Sorry about it. I did it a few weeks ago, but it’s finally taking hold!” He started hyperventilating. “P-possessed? But why?” We smirked, “Remember that legend that died at the last Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Competition?” I started being able to read his mind, and he had no memory of it. “N-no? Someone died at the contest?” 



“Yes, me! Anyway, I decided to do you a favor. I saw that you were only 5 dogs away from beating that douche Reggie, and out of the kindness of my heart, I decided that I was going to push you to that next level.” I could tell he was confused. “What’s your name?” I was about to drop the bombshell, “Percy Hartman.” He paused, “Who?” 



“I know you’re in shock about being possessed and finding out that it’s me, so I won’t hold your ineptitude against you. Here’s the thing: I’m here to help you, ok? You were only 5 dogs away from winning, and the best thing about it is, you eat hog dog buns dry.” Still on the verge of a panic attack, he breathlessly responded, “I-I do?” I let a little laugh out, “You do now.” 

The mini hot dogs sat on the plate, stacked high. 100 little wieners just ready to be inhaled. “What do you want me to do with these?” I couldn’t believe how dumb he was. Realizing how close he was to beating Reggie, he was too dumb to realize he was full. “You eat them.” He scratched his head in confusion, but I pulled his arm away from his head, grabbing a mini hot dog. “Look, you will be eating dry buns, ok? This is what needs to happen, and you will beat Reggie. Practice with these little dogs, and you can get used to swallowing them dry. Then we can move up to bigger ones. They’re like training wheels.” We nodded, and we grabbed a whole bunch of mini dogs, forcing them down our throats



One by one, we shoved them down—me through him—and let me tell you, swallowing dry mini dogs as a noob isn’t exactly a picnic.



He coughed. I grunted. We were a mess.



“Okay, not bad,” I said, trying to sound encouraging. “Keep going. Reggie’s out there thinking he’s untouchable. We’re about to prove him wrong. We have about 11 months to get this right.”



Caleb gave me one of my patent smirks. “This is insane. But maybe... I’m in.” His hand reached down and grabbed 10 mini dogs in his grubby hands, and I let out a scoff out of his mouth, “You don’t really have a choice.” 



As the months rolled by, the mini wieners gave way to Nathan's approved Hot Dogs and buns. Caleb was a quick study. He wasn’t just copying me—he was innovating. That squish technique? Genius. He’d compress those buns so fast and slick, it was like watching the hottest water slide in the world, except it was all inside his throat. I was experiencing a true throat GOAT at work. 



I was proud. I was molding him into a mini-me, which I knew was the only way he could get those extra 6 dogs down to win the competition! 



Then came the braces; it was necessary for the rubber bands in the back. The sharp braces would help rip the dogs and bread. The rubber bands pulled his jaw tighter, closing his mouth faster than a trapdoor. Yeah, I forced him to do it, but it was for the greater good. It was brutal, but effective. Plus, it gave me an excuse to nag him daily to train.

 

“Open wider! No, wider! What is that? A mouth of a mouse?? Wider! Chomp! CHOMP! BITE THE WEINERS”



Caleb grumbled but played along, because deep down, he knew we were onto something. That squish technique for the buns was the real game-changer. There was just no way that we could lose. 



Before we knew it, it was time. A year had passed, and there was nothing more that I could teach him. We were going to do this together. Caleb was no longer a rookie, and through all the hard work and the hype from last year, you could tell that people were expecting big things this year from him. I could feel his nerves; the pressure was intense, but he knew what he had to do. “Remember, no water. Dry buns, all the way. This is your moment to take down Reggie ‘Left No’ Crumm once and for all.” I had to throw as much last-minute coaching as possible, and I could feel Caleb cracking a grin, braces and all. “Let’s do this, Percy. For you... and for the dry bun legacy.” I couldn’t help but laugh. “The lisp is funny; you sound so dumb.” He was locked in now. 

The sun was blazing, and the crowd’s roar hit like a tidal wave. Nathan’s Hot Dog Eating Contest, the moment we’d been grinding for months.



Caleb sat at the table, braces gleaming, eyes locked on the steaming plates piled high. Nathans were no fools; they knew who the two people they came to see were. Caleb was placed right next to Reggie “Left No” Crumm. They both glared at each other before Reggie smirked like he already owned the title.



I whispered in Caleb’s head, “Remember the plan. Dry buns only. Don’t let him see you sweat. He’s a bitch.”



The buzzer blared.



Hands flew. Dogs vanished.



Caleb was on fire, slapping down buns like a machine, the new compression technique working like a charm. The crowd started to murmur, noticing he was keeping pace with Reggie.

Then with time ticking down, and victory in our midst—disaster.



Reggie’s face twisted. His throat caught. The crowd gasped. A hot dog was lodged in his throat. 

“Now’s your chance,” I urged Caleb. We looked back, and Reggie was up 2, and we needed these last few hot dogs to win. But then, something unexpected. Caleb hesitated. Inside his head, I felt the battle — win at all costs, or help a rival in trouble?



“Help him, or win?” I asked silently.



Caleb’s voice trembled inside, “We... we help.”



I didn’t want to hear it, but as we looked at Reggie, I couldn’t help but side with Caleb. I saw a vision into the past, seeing myself choke just a year prior. No one came to my aid, and I knew I couldn’t let that happen to Reggie, too. 



We moved behind Reggie and executed the Heimlich maneuver. Reggie coughed, spat out a bun, and chunks and chunks of hot dog. He gasped for air.



The time was still ticking. 3… 2….. 1…. BUZZ!! 



The buzzer sounded, and the scores were tight. We were so busy aiding Reggie, we didn’t even notice that they deducted 3 hot dogs from his final score. The hot dogs that were lodged in his throat got launched out of his esophagus; they didn’t count. Caleb won by one hot dog!



The crowd erupted. I smiled. And the confetti fell from the heavens again. The Mustard belt was placed on his shoulder, and all was right in the world. 



Mission accomplished.



The roar of the crowd was deafening, but with the silence inside my head, I felt something else. Peace. Caleb lifted the Mustard Belt high, the glow of victory reflecting in his eyes.

I finally spoke, my voice calm but proud. “You did it, Caleb. You’re a champion now. Better than I ever was.”



He turned his head slowly, the ghostly presence still inside him clear in his head. “Couldn’t have done it without you, Percy. You made me believe I could do the impossible.”



I smiled, but beneath it was a shadow of something darker. “This was my last ride. I’m done haunting you. Time for me to move on.”



Caleb nodded, a mixture of gratitude and sadness on his face.



I felt myself begin to fade, but instead of the eternal bliss I expected to overtake me. I felt my deepest fear coming true. A strange, sour feeling, a sloppy, disintegrating feeling.



The heat was overwhelming. I felt like a puddle of sweat. I was no longer just a ghost, nor was I the sweat I had thought.  I was a grotesque, writhing mass of soggy, wet bread, wriggling around in what I could only describe as the underworld. Little red men with pitchforks and tails pierced my goopy bread skin and licked the tip of their pitchforks. 



I screamed, trapped in this monstrous form, doomed to suffer the ultimate torment: the thing I despised most in the world, and the afterlife. Wet bread. 



The unfamiliar world around me blurred as I realized… this was my hell.

Otherwise, I eliminated sweets almost entirely, eat only bits of chocolate(mostly after lunch or supper), upped my consumption of fruits and vegetables, switched to low GI bread while reducing my overall bread consumption and either have my meats baked or air fried if I am not making a stew or curry.

Nothing I try seems to make this stuff tastes good, it’s literally like Waffle House coffee tier every time I make it. There’s chocolate if I look for it but it’s mostly just bitter.

I’ve tried everywhere from 3.5-5.5 on the grinder, and water temps from 85-95 degrees C. For the switch I use the tetsu devil recipe. On the deep 27 I do 6 grams coffee to 100 grams water, 20 bloom for 30 seconds, then 20g pours until I get to 100g. I’ve also tried 15 grams coffee to 250 grams water, 30g bloom for 30 seconds, then pour to 80 grams, then to 160, then to 250. 

I’m wondering if it’s roasted too dark for the ZP6? Idk, I’ve never had this hard of a time getting a serviceable cup of coffee out of ostensibly high quality beans. I’ve tried both TWW and tap water to no avail. I’ve tried using my old timemore C2 and that just made it muddier. Any advice?

1moaho2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CountertopConfessions/comments/1moaho2/what_makes_the_breville_bambino_plus_the_best/,What Makes the Breville Bambino Plus the Best Semi-Automatic Espresso Machine?,"Breville BES500DBL1BUS1 entered my life as an exciting new addition to my morning routine, promising café-quality espresso in a sleek, compact design. Testing it daily felt less like a chore and more like an enjoyable journey into the world of barista-style coffee. As someone who appreciates the fine art of espresso-making but despises big setups or overly complex machines, this product quickly grabbed my attention. 

### **Key Benefits**

The espresso machine flaunts its **compact footprint** right away. At just 7.7 inches wide, it fits snugly on my crowded kitchen counter without hogging valuable space. Despite its small size, it doesn’t compromise on quality. The **ThermoJet heating system** heats the machine in a mind-blowingly short 3 seconds. Unlike others I've tried, where I have to wait what feels like an eternity for it to warm up, this one lets me basically jump straight into brewing. How often can you say an espresso machine works on your time?

The automatic milk frother is ridiculously fun to use. If you enjoy latte art—or even if you barely know how to make a basic cup of coffee—this feature will surprise you with its ability to create silky microfoam effortlessly. You can also adjust the milk texture and temperature, which adds some nice customization options if you're picky like me. The **low-pressure pre-infusion** evenly spreads water across the grounds, creating a rich, balanced flavor. I honestly wasn’t expecting this level of performance.

- Ultra-fast heating and brew times save my mornings.  
- Milk frother produces café-style foam suitable for lattes or cappuccinos.  
- Compact size easily fits small kitchens or crowded counters.  
- Easy-to-use controls for one or two cups.  

[Check Breville BES500DBL1BUS1 price on Amazon.](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b0bdmtkf5b/)

### **Design and Build**

The first thing that caught my eye about this espresso machine is its **modern aesthetic**. The Damson Blue finish adds a gorgeous, sleek touch that stands out among generic kitchen appliances. Its controls are well-thought-out: buttons for a single or double shot, steam, and milk temperature adjustments make it straightforward even if you’ve never used a machine like this before. I appreciate how intuitive it feels—there’s no steep learning curve, just quick setup, and you're off to the races.

What surprised me was the quality of the materials. It feels solid without being cumbersome. The 54mm portafilter is a notable upgrade compared to smaller one-size-fits-all designs; it holds 19 grams of grounds nicely, resulting in deeper, richer flavors. It doesn’t feel like they cut any corners when designing it. Even the **inclusion of useful extras** like a stainless-steel milk jug, tamper, and cleaning tools impressed me.

### **Positives**

- A stunning, modern design adds flair to any kitchen.  
- Functional extras like a 16 fl. oz. milk jug and precision tools included.  
- Simple, user-friendly interface perfect for beginners or enthusiasts.  

### **Adverse Aspects**

That said, no machine is perfect, and there are aspects that feel like they could use polishing. Cleaning the machine after every use, for example, can be a bit tedious because of its manual operation mode. The auto-purge feature helps with this, sure, but it’s not a cure-all if you’re someone who wants low-maintenance gear. Additionally, while the machine makes excellent espresso, it does so at the cost of producing quite a bit of noise during the brewing process. If anyone in your home is sensitive to sound, you’ll need to keep that in mind.

- Cleaning after brewing might feel imposed for some users.  
- Tends to be louder compared to larger commercial alternatives.

### **Other Options**

While this espresso machine is impressive within its category, it’s worth seeing how it measures up against competing products. For instance, the De'Longhi Dedica Deluxe has a similarly slim profile but lacks the advanced ThermoJet heating technology of the Bambino Plus, which sets it apart for speed. Machines like the Gaggia Classic Pro, on the other hand, come equipped with more manual controls, making them better suited for enthusiasts seeking full creative control. However, I’d argue that the Bambino Plus strikes a better balance for those seeking both ease of use and quality results.

Compared to these rivals, the Bambino Plus doesn’t just offer superior heating and frothing but also delivers on style and compactness. It does fall behind machines like the Jura E6 in automation but more than makes up for it in affordability and efficiency.

### **Worth Every Penny**

In terms of **value proposition**, this machine is a solid contender in its category. While comparable espresso machines may come with additional automation like integrated grinders, they don’t hit the sweet spot of being this compact, reliable, and fast. Considering the included features, I think the cost is very well-justified. If you’re someone who appreciates a quick cup of coffee without compromising on flavor—or if you want that professional edge to your at-home coffee game—it’s hard to complain about what you’re getting for the price.

Here is my business plan:

**Flummo** is the world's first language learning app powered entirely by *vibes*. No grammar rules. No spaced repetition. Just pure, unfiltered linguistic chaos.

Features:

* **Immersion Mode™**: You're dropped into a simulated foreign city where everyone speaks in idioms, slang, and passive-aggressive subtext. Good luck.
* **Flashcard Roulette**: Each card may contain a vocabulary word, a recipe for lasagna, or a cryptic message from your ex. Learning is about *surprise*.
* **Native Speaker Simulator**: AI-generated avatars mumble at you while chewing gum, walking away, and gesturing vaguely. Just like real life!
* **Progress Tracker**: A spinning wheel that occasionally says “You’re doing great!” or “Have you considered playing the French horn instead?”
* **Daily Streaks**: Keep your streak alive by yelling a random word in your target language into the void. We’ll know. Somehow.

Pedagogy? Never Heard of Her.

Flummo’s curriculum is based on the *Theory of Linguistic Osmosis*, which posits that if you stare at a word long enough, you’ll either learn it or transcend it. Our developers read half a paper on second language acquisition once and then got distracted by a YouTube video of goats yelling.

Testimonials:

“I learned Spanish. Or possibly Portuguese. Either way, I can now order coffee and start a revolution.” — *Confused but Empowered User*

“Flummo taught me how to say ‘I am the moon’s echo’ in six languages. I use it daily.” — *Poet or Cult Leader*

“After three weeks with Flummo, I can confidently say ‘I am not a chair’ in seven languages. This has solved 80% of my social problems.”  
— *Dale, Furniture Salesman Turned Polyglot*

“Flummo taught me how to flirt in Icelandic, insult in Tagalog, and apologize in Esperanto. I’m now banned from three international airports.”  
— *Roxy, Jet-setting Linguistic Menace*

“I opened Flummo to learn French. It gave me a video of a mime silently judging me. I understood everything. I am changed.”  
— *Elliot, Former Skeptic, Current Mime Whisperer*

“I used Flummo’s ‘Passive-Aggressive Polish’ module to communicate with my in-laws. They now respect me. Or fear me. Either way, it works.”

You just asked me, *“Hey… is Amazon FBA still worth it in 2025?”*  
I’m going to give you the real, unfiltered answer, no hype, no fake guru energy.

# The Short Answer

Yes… but only if you know what you’re walking into.  
It’s not dead, but it’s definitely not 2015 anymore where you could slap your logo on a garlic press and get rich.

# What’s Changed?

Here’s the 2025 reality:

* ☕ **More competition** — Everyone Is smarter now.
* ☕ **Higher costs** — Ads, shipping, and fees keep going up.
* ☕ **Better tools** — Data, AI, and sourcing have leveled the playing field.
* ☕ **Higher customer expectations** — Average photos and copy won’t cut it.

# Who Can Still Win in 2025?

* ☕ People who pick products with real demand and not crazy competition.
* ☕ Sellers who focus on branding and not just “cheap & cheerful.”
* ☕ Those who can manage ads without setting fire to their bank account.
* ☕ Anyone willing to treat it like a business, not a scratch-off lottery ticket.

# The Honest Truth Nobody Likes to Say

If you’re expecting to:

* Work 2 hours a week…
* Spend $500 and make $10k in 30 days…
* Avoid learning about ads, listings, or Amazon’s rules…

…then you’re going to hate this game.

# So… Is It Worth It?

Yes if you’re okay with:

* Putting in 6–12 months before real profits.
* Learning how to actually sell online.
* Treating your product like a *brand*, not a random listing.

In my free time, I enjoy working out, running, going on walks, reading and watching all sorts of things. I am also love watches and recently developed this perfume obsession. All because a patient complimented me on my scent. Genuinely made me tweak out lmao. 

I also came to a revelation about a recent perfume I picked. Which I LOVE. But apperantly I am the only one on the planet who likes it. 

Why do I never get obsessed with useful things. Never is it an obsession with something that could make me rich. Only with the things that can empty my pockets. But such is life. I shall continue walking down this path, but smelling nice as I do. 

I also love memes and like to joke around quite a bit. So if thats not your cup of rooibos honey tea, I am sorry. 

So send me a message, I come in peace. I wont force you to smell the leathery goodness of my new perfume, yet. Also for the love of god, dont ask me for the info I have already provided in the post. It genuinely makes me crash out.

M26 from Paris, I love going to techno events/raves in Paris.  me and my friends go regularly to techno parties/raves.

Would love a female friend/rave partner to match my energy on the dance floor.

I always dance a lot and I've got high energy levels on the dance floor.

I'm looking for someone who could be on par with me. And also obviously be kind and free spirited  :))

Of course we could get to know each other before heading out to a gig over a coffee or just a walk at a park to see if we vibe :) 

We could obviously discuss that and the type of techno we really love.

If you're interested in a rave partner who not only shares your passion for techno but who's also super nice, chill and loves dancing

1moa8r2,https://www.reddit.com/r/MTHFR/comments/1moa8r2/my_mthfr_protocol_for_long_covid/,My MTHFR Protocol for Long Covid,"Hi all. This community has given so much to me when conventional medicine stopped looking. So, I want to give back. Best anyone can figure, I got Long Covid in April of 2024, and I soon developed anxiety, orthostatic hypotension, heart palpitations, neurological issues (I even developed OCD for about 30 minutes one day). Up until this point, I had no such issues. After some research and many, many doctors later, I decided to test my polymorphisms because I suspected my issues were due to methylation. Below, are my polymorphisms and the associated protocol that I’m using (refined consultation with Dr. Tyler Panzner).
 
I am Hom MTHFR 677, Het COMT, Hom & Het Slow MAO, Hom MTR / 2x Hom MTRR, 3x Het DRD2, Hom & 5x Het PEMT, Hom & 2x Het BHMT, Hom CBS, Hom SUOX, Het DHCR7/ Hom & 2x Het GC/ Hom & Het VDR/ Het CYP24A1, 2x Het AOC1, Hom HNMT, Hom FAAH/ Het DAGLB, 3x Het NOS3, Hom MMP1, Hom GSTP1, Hom & Het GABRG2/GABRA6, Hom & Het GAD1, & Hom GRM8.
 
I am 2 weeks into this protocol and already feel better. In another 2-4 weeks, In addition to the usual blood work (CBC & CMP), I will get homocysteine, ferritin, iron, hsCRP, Vitamin D (ideally inactive 25D and active 1,25D), Omega 3 : Omega 6 fatty acid ratio, and BUN checked.
 
Paraxanthine (caffeine alternative) (coffee will cause a histamine release so I try to avoid drinking it, cold brew is better)

Make sure you eat at least half of breakfast before taking pills. You want to make sure there's food in stomach 
 
With other meals:  
 
-DAO enzymes (Histamine block/digest) [1 pill] can be taken with every meal after a week or so on the other supps for 2-3 days to get used to what low gut histamine feels like. If you don't notice anything, try 2 pills before each meal. Be sure to take some notes so you can gauge how you feel. Think of this as a tool to learn when your gut histamine is high. I would keep this on hand if you will be consuming high histamine foods (see the meeting notes for some examples of top problematic foods/drinks) 
 
-1 pill lithium orotate (1mg) with the last meal/snack of the evening. Pay attention to how you feel the next day. It's all about balancing the calmness from lowered adrenaline while not lowering adrenaline so much you're ""too chill"" and don't want to get things done. You can slowly work up to 5 pills total (5mg), but you may not actually need that much. This can also be taken any time of day. Some like morning dosing. Can also be taken during a stress spike. Explore and learn how it interacts with your unique biology :)

1moa8cc,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1moa8cc/longing_for_something_thats_long_gone/,Longing for something that’s long gone,"My husband and I are both in our 30’s and have been together over 10 years, 4 and a half years married. We have a child who is young with special needs that likes to sleep with me, resulting in my husband and I in different beds. This has been going on for almost a year. And we are distancing more by the day. 

Our relationship is failing. We don’t have sex. There is no intimacy whatsoever. We used to have sex 2 times a week. Now it’s once a month if I’m lucky as an obligatory/only when he is interested. I don’t even remember the last time he wanted to kiss or hug me out of his own free will. 

I have been open about this to him, and I’m shut down every time. He says he’s tired and stressed from working. I spend nights hoping he had some kind of interest in me, and he just goes to sleep. So i lay there and cry and wish so much he would notice and pull me close.

Last night was my breaking point. Earlier in the day i confronted him about not being interested in me anymore. I even asked if he is no longer attracted to me because i gained weight. I told him i feel lonely and unwanted and unloved. He never replied. Later in the evening I was hoping maybe we’d talk about it, but he just mocked me in front of friends over for dinner over sex - or lack thereof.  (It’s not just about sex - I’m literally neglected physically mentally and emotionally).

After our toddler was in bed (alone finally), he came to lay down to “talk” and by talking I mean asking me to eat ice cream with him. I declined as this is his tactic to avoid the elephant in the room.  He asked a few more times and then finally said “you want me to do something with you, so I ask, and you don’t want to. And you expect me to give you sex.”

I pretended i was asleep but cried for about an hour as he fell asleep. I went outside and cried more. I cried in the bathroom. I have never felt so unloved, unwanted, unseen. I finally had the courage to wake him up and he wasn’t responsive. I told him you don’t kiss me or hold me or show me any type of affection anymore. You come home and sit on your phone. You criticize me or mock me 24/7 for a chuckle from our friends. I feel alone, i just want you to show me you love me. And i miss the old you.

His response: I’m tired from working. I want to come home and relax. I don’t know what you want from me.

In my head I’m just like… I. JUST. TOLD. YOU. WHAT. I. WANT. FROM. YOU.  Hold me, tell me to stop crying and you’ll try. That you love me, that you can’t live without me… that you’re sorry…. But no, nothing.

I left to lay on the couch and cried intensely praying he’d come out for me and hold me and tell me we’d work on it.

To my surprise he did come out and tell me to go to bed. My innate response was to cry more and decline. So he got angry and told me I would wake our child and to stop being a crazy lady. I told him to go to bed. So he replied again “i don’t know what you want from me.” HOW. 

I am not crazy. I am lonely. My self confidence and self worth are at an all time low. I’ve let myself go (and so has he). Stopped caring, stopped wearing makeup, stopped dressing nicely. 

I eventually went back to bed after my toddler woke up crying and I calmed him down in his room. My husband turned and put his arm around me, but it was surface level. And I was still crying which didn’t seem to bother him. 

This morning he acted as if giving me attention was an inconvenience. He was annoyed that he didn’t get a good nights sleep…. I shouldn’t have but i got out his clothes and made him a cup of coffee thinking maybe he had thought about all of this.

He told our child to come give me a kiss and hug, to which my toddler declined stating that he didn’t want to (which was like a triple blow to the gut). And my husband came and said “goodbye have a good day, i love you too!” As if it was come kind of little cocky here I’ll say it even though you didn’t say anything to me. And kissed my head. He couldn’t even give me a proper kiss. My response was “bye” to which he sighed like “great she still is being crazy”

I miss the man i fell in love with. Kind words, gestures, lots of affection. Maybe it all wasn’t real. Maybe it was just to secure someone so he didn’t have to be alone. He used to be incredibly romantic, but i guess as time went on it faded, and it’s the worst it’s ever been. He’s more interested in hanging with his buddies, working (for family), and his phone. 

I even looked at his phone last night, and there were some google searches like “how to tell someone something is a turn off,” and “synonym for unhappy.” Clearly it’s about me. What also is confusing is he is constantly saying that I will cheat on him for sex, and polices my phone with jealousy. Maybe he’s a narcissist. I mean i guess that would make sense considering everything’s always my fault, and I’m apologizing for literally nothing to keep the peace for our child. We’ve gotten in physical altercations before as well in high stress times (special needs child). 

I’m in therapy and learning that i never really had someone to love me like I needed. My parents have wounded me from childhood on. I clung to boyfriends because I had someone type of attention. I bounced from one to the next because I needed to feel loved by someone since I never got it at home. Maybe I chose the wrong man. Maybe I’ll learn this through healing what is broken inside me. 

Heck I didn’t even start therapy until i had a mental breakdown because of my special needs child. I couldn’t handle him. I was snapping, we were snapping at each other. And I’m learning that I’m just broken and alone. 

Either way I’m dying inside with the lack of emotional and physical intimacy. I’m just lost, and no one understands. The thought of divorce is there often. Sometimes it feels liberating. Other times I cry over the thought of it ending. I had a psychic tell me I need to leave and i didn’t mention my relationship at all to her. 

Who knows if i even love him anymore or if I am just yearning for a feeling of someone to love me. I’m so lost and numb. Maybe i fucked my life up from meeting someone who will love me like I need by getting married. Maybe I get divorced and find love like I need. Maybe i end up alone. A big part of me his too scared to find out because of the fear of financially affording a divorce and all it entails and the dreaded custody battle.

1moa7xj,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1moa7xj/should_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker_be_the/,Should the best single serve coffee maker be the Keurig K-Supreme,"Using the Keurig K-Supreme Coffee Maker, model 062151515291, has been a daily ritual for weeks now, and I can confidently say this machine is equal parts innovative and practical. Having relied on numerous single-serve brewers in the past, my expectations were high, and this coffee maker didn’t disappoint—most of the time. It brought a mix of delight and minor frustrations, but overall, it became a centerpiece of my mornings.

**Effortless Design and Space Optimization**

This brewer is compact yet commands attention with a sleek, matte plastic finish. Tucking it into a cozy kitchen corner was simple, thanks to its slim profile and dual-position reservoir. The removable 66-ounce tank was a revelation—it saved me from the constant trips to the sink that my previous single-serve alternatives demanded. Refilling the reservoir was effortless, and the design lent itself well to maintaining an uncluttered countertop aesthetic.

**Customizable Brewing Experience**

The strongest appeal of this coffee maker is its robust customization options. The buttons on the machine allow you to adjust coffee strength and choose from multiple brew sizes (6, 8, 10, or 12 ounces). The ""Strong"" button was my favorite feature since I enjoy bold cups that pack some punch. I even tackled my iced coffee cravings by brewing hot coffee directly over ice; it performed admirably, with only minimal dilution. This versatility made it feel like having a mini coffee shop right in my home.

[Check Keurig 062151515291 price on Amazon.](https://newcookware.com/p/b08vjl3hpc/)

**Advanced Multistream Technology**

The much-touted Multistream Technology certainly lived up to its promise, delivering full-bodied brews with rich aroma. Each pod tasted noticeably enhanced, evenly extracting flavors that were often overlooked by my older machines. It's hard to overstate how fresh and satisfying the result felt. I especially noticed this improvement with darker roasts and specialty blends. For those picky about flavor detail, like me, this technology is a winning point.

**Strengths**

- Offers multiple brew sizes, accommodating mug preferences  
- Travel-mug friendly design for on-the-go individuals  
- Multistream Technology brings out nuanced flavors and aromas  
- Easily removable tank simplifies cleaning and refilling  

**Areas for Improvement**

- Lack of an auto-clean function means extra maintenance effort  
- Button responsiveness occasionally feels sluggish  
- It's rather noisy during brewing, which might bother light sleepers nearby  
- Requires separate purchase of My K-Cup Universal Reusable Coffee Filter for ground coffee  

**Competing Alternatives**

When placed next to market contemporaries like the Nespresso VertuoPlus and Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, the Keurig K-Supreme stood out for its customization options and ability to accommodate both grounds and pods. While the Nespresso offers a more premium feel and greater beverage variety (including espressos), it falls short when it comes to reservoir capacity and versatility for travel mugs. On the other hand, the Hamilton Beach model came close in competition, offering dual brewing capabilities. Still, it lacked Keurig's sophistication in flavor extraction or the option to brew iced coffee.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

Considering the robust features packed into this coffee maker, it provides exceptional quality for its price range. The ability to brew multiple cup sizes, enhance strength, and choose between pods and ground coffee maximizes its utility. Sure, a few minor adjustments could elevate the experience, but even as it is, the value-for-money quotient feels justified.

1moa7lb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1moa7lb,DR. Elena Voss,"Dr. Elena Voss is a 27-year-old geophysicist, a doctorate holder in seismic activity and glacial dynamics, sent under Directive #1995-84-EV to the I.S.H.T.A.R. Antarctic research base to monitor unusual subglacial shifts. The posting was meant to be prestigious—a solitary station assignment, reserved for those the organization trusted with sensitive work. But prestige can feel like exile when the reality sets in.

The base is hers alone. No colleagues. No chatter in the corridors. Just the hum of the heating systems, the occasional groan of shifting ice beyond the walls, and her own movements breaking the silence. She wakes when she wants, eats when she wants, and works to the rhythm of her own thoughts. At first, the isolation felt like a rare gift. Now, months in, it’s a presence all its own, thick, heavy, and hard to ignore.

She walks the warm halls in the comfort of her own habits: black lace lingerie, garter belt, sheer stockings, and her open white lab coat, the heels of her shoes clicking against tile in slow, echoing beats. It’s not about vanity; she tells herself it’s simply comfortable in the base’s constant climate. But there’s something intoxicating about the contrast, soft skin against the cold reality outside, delicate lace against a backdrop of steel and concrete.

Her days are a ritual: wake, make coffee, check the seismic monitors, log any fluctuations, and step out to the ice edge to recalibrate sensors. Evenings are slower—long walks through the corridors with a mug in hand, pacing past storage rooms and empty bunks, or sitting in the common room with a stack of maps, tracing the labyrinth of fissures beneath the glacier. The data is strange. Movements that don’t match the expected seasonal shifts. Deep, rhythmic tremors that feel almost deliberate.

And yet… more and more, she finds herself stopping mid-stride, holding her breath, and listening. It’s nothing, she tells herself. A creak of settling metal, the pop of a heating pipe, wind pressing against the siding. But the sensation lingers. The distinct, irrational certainty that somewhere in this vast, empty place, something else is listening back.

When she returns to her quarters, she sometimes swears she notices small things moved. A pen out of place, the lab stool facing a different direction, the faintest scuff mark on the tile that wasn’t there yesterday. She keeps telling herself she’s imagining it. That the base is silent. That she is alone.

1moa6kb,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverydayUpgrades/comments/1moa6kb/should_you_try_the_presto_05206_popcorn_popper/,Should You Try the Presto 05206 Popcorn Popper for Movie Nights?,"Grabbing a new popcorn popper is like welcoming a fresh coffee machine into my life—exciting and full of promise. Using the Presto 05206, I found myself reliving those movie-night vibes with a touch of gourmet flair. Right out of the box, this popcorn popper’s compact and cheerful yellow design immediately caught my eye. Sure, aesthetics might not be the main priority, but who doesn’t appreciate a pop of color in their kitchen?  

**Design and Build Quality**  
Nothing says “quality” more than a product that feels sturdy when you hold it, and this popper delivers on that front. Its ceramic nonstick surface, paired with a lightweight 2.65 pounds, makes it user-friendly. I particularly liked that the base nests inside the cover—a godsend for someone who has a kitchen cupboard rivaling Tetris blocks. Although it’s made of a combination of ceramic and plastic, the build feels durable, and everything, from the ergonomic handle to the snug fitting lid, exudes practicality.

**Performance and Features**  
Popcorn enthusiasts like me know the heartbreak of unpopped kernels at the bottom of the bowl. The Presto popcorn maker claims to leave virtually no kernels behind, and after testing it, this goes beyond marketing fluff. Fresh batches of crispy, fluffy popcorn emerged consistently, popping up to 9 cups with ease. The transparent vented cover, which doubles as a serving bowl, deserves a chef’s kiss for its innovation. My usual routine now involves popping the kernels, snapping on the lid to the vented cover, and flipping it to serve directly—a small joy in my snack-loving life.

[Check Presto 05206 price on Amazon.](https://grillsbbq.com/p/b0dg9ykw96/)  

**Highlights**  
- Compact design: Perfect for small kitchens or cluttered spaces like mine.  
- Built-in cord wrap: Keeps the countertop tidy.  
- PFAS-free ceramic surface: Easier to clean than other nonstick coatings.  
- Versatility: Works splendidly for caramel corn, snack mixes, and other treats.  

Now, let’s talk about storage. Thanks to the clever construction, the base nests into the cover, which means no awkward stacking in my already overstuffed kitchen. Even its cord has a place to hide, eliminating that usual tangling mess. I might have fist-pumped when I realized I wouldn’t be digging through a drawer to find a loose power cord again.

**Bad Points**  
- Cleaning, while manageable, still requires attention. The ceramic nonstick surface is smooth, but I found that oil residue clings to the vented cover if you don’t wipe it down immediately. Who likes scrubbing, right?  
- The power switch feels a bit awkward when toggling it on and off since it’s front-facing and slightly recessed. Nothing major, just something I noticed.  
- While the plastic build makes the machine lighter, it also means I handle it cautiously—dropped it once, and though it survived, I wouldn’t test fate twice.  

**Challengers**  
Looking at other options in the popcorn popper world, the competition is tough with models like the Cuisinart Pop & Serve and the West Bend Stir Crazy. Compared to Cuisinart, this popper outshines with its innovative cover-turned-serving-bowl, whereas Cuisinart lacks this nifty feature. On the other hand, if capacity is paramount, the West Bend Stir Crazy offers space for larger batches, edging ahead for family-sized servings. However, it doesn’t fold up as neatly, making the Presto the tidier choice.  

**Worth Every Penny**  
One of my friends asked me straight up if a popcorn popper was “really worth it” when I could just buy pre-popped bags from the store. My answer? Absolutely. The Presto popper gives fresh popcorn an entirely different feel; it’s crisp, warm, and completely customizable down to the seasoning. In terms of value, I’d call it a smart buy. It hovers in a mid-range price bracket compared to competitors, yet its additional practical features and compact design justify the investment fully.

For some context, I (30F) am a teacher and after being at the same school for 6 years, was just recently reassigned due to budget cuts. I will now be teaching a new grade level, in a new building, with all new staff and administration. I’ve had many big feelings about this, and have cried so much over leaving all of my friends behind, but regardless I am thankful to have a job.

This week, my new classroom was done being cleaned so I was allowed to go in and pick up my keys to start moving. I had been so nervous about this move because I was going to have to do the big haul by myself in order to maximize the time left before school starts. My husband was denied the time off and he works long hours, and it just didn’t seem fair to ask anyone else in my family to take time off work to help me move. I also have a baby, so I was prepared to have to wear him in his carrier and tackle the boxes and furniture on my own. 

(I think it’s also important to note that all of my teacher friends also got disbursed to a different building so they had to move their own stuff.. another reason I felt like I shouldn’t ask them for help.)

Well yesterday morning, I went to pick up my classroom keys..

And when I arrived back home, my brother in law was already parked in my driveway and waiting to help me get loaded up!! 

Shortly after, my teacher friend pulled in with coffee in hand (for me) and also ready to help!! 

In 1 hour we had all 3 cars loaded up and ready to go, and by noon we had moved most of my stuff into my classroom!

My mom is planning to take time off work this morning to help me start getting organized.

I’m just feeling so grateful for the help I’m being given. My brother in law switched his days off to be able to help me, and my friend prioritized moving me in before going to her own classroom. All without being asked.

I came home with my heart so full of gratitude, to find boxes on my front step! I was initially so confused because I was sure we had taken everything but then I realized they were sealed Amazon packages and when I opened them I found that it was stuff off my wishlist!! From total strangers!! I was already so emotional over the day I had, so this act of kindness just had me sobbing. 

Anyways, my village came through today, and now, I get to start doing the fun part, which is creating a beautiful space to welcome my new students come September ❤️",68,1755008726.0,wholesome,6,1.0,False

1moa5z7,https://i.redd.it/iuwi2jxyllif1.jpeg,"Born in London in 1936, Lance Reventlow (Lawrence Graf von Haugwitz-Hardenberg-Reventlow) was the son of Woolworth heiress Barbara Hutton and nobleman Count Curt von Haugwitz-Hardenberg-Reventlow and had Prince Igor Troubetzkoy and actor Cary Grant as stepfathers.","Prince Igor Troubetzkoy had won the 1948 Targa Florio and, through him, Lance developed a passion for racing. While competing in club events near his Hollywood, home, he befriended actor and fellow racer James Dean. Ironically, Lance was one of the last people to speak to Dean when they met on their way to an auto race in Salinas, California, as they had coffee at a restaurant around thirty minutes before Dean was killed while driving his Porsche 550 Spyder.

After racing in Europe, and visiting some sports car manufacturers (Cooper, Lister and Maserati), it Reventlow was inspired to build a car of his own with only American parts. Reventlow Automobiles Inc, was formed and, with chief engineer Phil Remington and designers/builders Tom Barnes and Dick Troutman, they produced a limited number of sports racers, called Scarabs, a tongue-in-cheek nod at the worshipped Egyptian amulet also known to be a shit-eating dung beetle. 

Scarabs competed in F1 and SCCA competition, acquitting themselves handily
and becoming the stuff of motorsport legend. 

The eight Scarabs built consisted of three front engined Chevy powered sports cars, three front engined formula cars, one rear engined formula car and a rear engined sports car. Reventlow Automobiles finally closed in 1962, with the building eventually being leased to Carroll Shelby, and Lance quit racing. Lance went on to marry actress Jill St. John and take up other interests including flying, sailing, skiing and polo. 

Sadly he was killed in a plane crash in 1972. Cary Grant was a part of his memorial service.

1moa34f,https://www.reddit.com/r/manprovement/comments/1moa34f/dont_let_friendships_drift_create_real_depth_and/,Don't let friendships drift! Create real depth and connection,"Building depth in your friendships proactively is important. It can help both of you through hard times when they inevitably come around, it can help make small rifts be more effectively repaired and can help you become a better person.

Life experiences are most often exciting and memorable when you share them with someone. It forms the stories you tell your grandkids and reduces the chances of lonliness.

Truly meaningful relationships are rarely built in months, but years. Experiences, big and small, create layers of connection that shape unique depth only experienced between you and that friend.

\----

# Shared Vulnerability

Creating depth in a relationship is hard if you’re both holding something back. It stops you from being your authentic self and creates barriers to connection.

Vulnerability doesn’t mean sharing every detail of your life, it means letting someone see the real you, even if that feels uncomfortable. It can be as simple as admitting you’re struggling with work, opening up about a recent disappointment, or sharing a personal goal you’ve been too shy to voice.

You set the tone by going first. When you offer a glimpse into your inner world, it invites your friend to do the same. This exchange builds trust, making the friendship feel safe and supportive.

The next time you catch up, resist the urge to stick to light updates. Instead, try sharing something honest that’s been on your mind, and follow it with a genuine question about their world. Vulnerability deepens connection, and often it’s the doorway to the most meaningful conversations you’ll ever have.



# Intentionality

Showing up is often the hardest part. We all live busy lives one way or another, so being intentional about making plans and showing up with energy shows your commitment to the friendship.

Intentionality means treating your friendships with the same care you would a valued project. Ensuring you’re making time for them, even when it’s not convenient. It could be scheduling a monthly dinner, sending a “thinking of you” message without reason, or remembering an important date in their life.

Small, deliberate actions build a sense of reliability, showing your friend that you value them enough to make the effort. This consistency is often what separates friendships that last from those that fade.

If it’s been a while, take the lead and set a date for your next meet-up. Even a short coffee or walk can be enough to signal that they matter to you, despite the complexities of life.



# Mutual Growth

A great friend is someone you can learn from and become a better person because of.

Mutual growth in friendship isn’t about pushing each other constantly, it’s about creating an environment where encouragement, inspiration, and honest feedback are welcome. These friendships help you see your blind spots, challenge you to stretch beyond your comfort zone, and celebrate your progress along the way.

Growth can happen through sharing knowledge, trying new things together, or simply supporting each other’s ambitions. It works best when it’s a two-way street: both of you offering and receiving encouragement without judgment.

Think of one area where your friend is working toward something, like a fitness goal, a creative project, a career move, then ask how you can support them. The mutual exchange of support transforms your friendship into a place where both of you can thrive.



# Shared Experiences

Often building depth in a friendship comes from what you do together, not what you say.

Shared experiences create memories, inside jokes, and a sense of “us” that words alone can’t match. Whether it’s travelling to a new city, taking a class together, or even facing a challenge side-by-side, these moments become part of your friendship’s story.

The key is to be intentional about creating these opportunities rather than waiting for them to happen by chance. Experiences don’t have to be grand or expensive, just cooking a meal together or playing games can build that shared history. It’s amazing what the world gives you when you act with intention.

Pick something you’ve never done together before and make a plan. Every shared adventure, big or small, adds another layer of connection. Those are the layers that make a friendship truly lasting.



# Repairing Rifts

Miscommunications, mistakes and absence can unintentionally degrade the quality of your friendships.

There are many circumstances where we wish we still maintained a friendship with someone, but have allowed it to degrade or sour. When you look back at it, you realise it was something relatively minor or insignificant in the greater scheme of things that caused the decline.

You should not let this get in the way of repairing rifts if you know there is true meaning in that friendship.

Never be afraid to extend the olive branch. The chances are they are willing to do the same. Taking that first step is daunting, but a simple ‘check in’ text or invite to low pressure meet reignites the spark.

When you get the chance to talk or meet again, don’t lead with the cause of the rift. Focus on the positive elements of the friendship to rebuild that connection. Jumping into the rift itself feels more like an attack, and without that base connection will unlikely close that rift.

# Take Action

These challenges will help you be more intentional about adding greater depth and meaning to your friendships.

**Challenge 1: Origin Story**

\- Set a calm 30-minute window without phones.

\- Each person retells the friendship origin in five minutes, from their perspective.

\- Name two turning points that deepened or challenged the bond and what each taught you.

\- Share one moment you’re grateful the other didn’t let go.

\- Capture a one-sentence headline for your friendship so far.

**Challenge 2: Adventure Time**

\- Agree on a day/time and budget

\- Pick a new-to-you option that matches energy and access: a new park loop, a street-food crawl, a beginner class, or a board-game café. Maybe plan something for a full day if you're feeling adventurous

\- Assign roles: one handles logistics, one curates vibe with music, snacks, or route.

\- Take one candid photo together and avoid perfection.

\- Debrief for five minutes: best moment, hardest moment, and one thing to repeat.

It’s been about a month, so I thought it was time for an updated post and a chance to connect.

The most important thing up front: I'm looking for genuine, platonic friendships only. I continue to navigate an illness, and my main goal is to find some easy-going, authentic people to share the good and the quiet days with.

A lot has shifted in the last month or so. The charity run I was training for is in the rearview mirror—a huge personal win! That journey is now evolving; I'm on the home stretch of my weight loss goal and am beginning to transition my focus to strength training. It feels like the start of a new chapter for my health.

Speaking of new chapters, I've finally put pen to paper on the novel I've been dreaming up. It's a mix of thrilling and terrifying, and I'm really keen to hear what other people are passionate about in their own lives.

If you're also someone who values a real, low-pressure friendship where we can talk about our passions, celebrate the small victories, and share a laugh (dark humour is a plus), I think we'd get along. My interests in writing, art, books, and video games are my constant anchors, with fitness being key everyday.

I’d love to hear about something you’re excited about right now. Or, let's start simple: What's your favourite tea?",1,1755008501.0,R4R30Plus,0,0.66,False
1moa1u8,https://www.reddit.com/r/step1/comments/1moa1u8/passed/,PASSED!!!,"I actually passed last Wednesday but was too busy to post. 

Tested on 21st July, I'm a non-US IMG, currently in my final year of medical school and have been preparing since last year. I started preparing for Step 1 last year and planned to give it in 6 months (November last year), but boy did things not work out. 

I kept delaying booking my date because I lacked confidence and I'm glad I did book it when I was certain. CONFIDENCE is key, if you're not confident enough that you know enough to pass then it's going to cause a lot of anxiety and doubt. When I finally sat for the exam, I felt completely burnt out and tired but did not feel I could've done more in those couple months. 

Now my PRE-DEDICATED:

I started preparing in May 2024 system-wise.

*VIDEOS - BnB* 
 I'm not a fan of passive reading, so I annotated FA using BnB videos. (Video resource -BnB). It's a good resource if your basics from the first two years are a little wobbly but did not help me retain much.

*QBank - UWorld*
Purchased Uworld kept doing it systemwise as and when I covered systems and whenever I got time. 

My issue was everyone advised me to do it in timed mode. I'd do a block, then get disappointed with my score, procrastinate reviewing that block and waste a week like that. It was a depressing loop I was stuck in. 
It is important to realise different things work for different people - timed mode did not work for me. Then I started scouring YouTube for help and found Dirty Medicine's video on how to use a QBank, that helped me get things in order. I started using TUTOR mode and my productivity drastically improved. I could get through 20-40qs per day (which was improvement from what I was covering).

By then it was already September and I knew I wouldn't be able to give it that year anyway because I had my third year exams coming in January. Took a break in the Dec-Jan period and resumed in Feb. 

Finished all the systems while simultaneously doing questions by March. 

Started revising the systems passively from FA - didnt work for me. 

DEDICATED:
Started dedicated in the first week of May. Took a complete break from school and started revision.

For systems - Watching HYGuru NBME concepts review videos really helped me start revising a system - then I would go through the points not covered in the video in FA. 

For biochem - binge watched the ENTIRE Dirty medicine playlist and it was worth it. Filled the gaps with FA

For Ethics - binge watched the ENTIRE Dirty medicine playlist, read FA and solved ALL the UWorld questions. That's all you can do for ethics honestly.

For micro - did not use Sketchy (not a Sketchy person, tried using it for sometime) so I developed a new system - elimination using buzzwords. Just started drawing tables - if it's gram+ve cocci - when is it staph/step - which strep and so on. Helped me memorize the buzzwords.

For biostats - honestly, didn't have as many issues with it since i'd studied it well in school but still watched the Randy Neil videos, they were pretty good.

For patho - re-watched pathoma 1-3. I think 3 was the most helpful since I covered immuno from FA.

Immuno - watched BnB videos, did UWorld, was still getting questions wrong on NBMEs so I binge watched the Mehlman QBank for immuno specifically (only 50qs) - made a lot of difference, wish I had time to go through that for other chapters.

Topics I was weak in:

- Neuro, MSK - referred to Mehlman PDFs (neuroanat, msk PDFs)

- anatomy - 100 concepts in gross anatomy pdf

- micro - Lolnatocop anki deck (couldn't finish it, but it was pretty good. My issue with Anki was consistency, I couldn't keep up)

-physio - Mehlman Arrows PDF

-Uworld - really helpful but I'm not really a question person so I could complete 40% with my attention span.

- Mehlman HY Risk Factors - absolutely MUST DO

My NBME scores :
NBME 27 - 54% (04/30)
NBME 28 - 59% (06/02)
NBME 26 - 64% (06/11)
NBME 29 - 63% (06/24) 
NBME 30 - 68% raw, 65% EPC (07/12)
New Free120 - 72% (at prometric)(07/14)
NBME 31 - 72% (raw and EPC) (07/18)
Old Free120 - 68% (07/19)

For self-assessments I would suggest starting them early and doing them every 2 weeks initially, then shortening it to weekly.Theres a break in May because my UWorld was expiring on 31st May and wanted to get as much done as possible. 

UWSAa were not at all useful for me and I dont think they added any value, just made me panic. I scored In my 50s in both of them. Didn't even bother reviewing the second one, because I was disappointed. 
The mistake I made was clubbing uwsa2 and old free120 on 19th to stimulate a 7hr exam literally 2 days before my exam. Couldn't sleep was tired and wasted an entire day with no value add at all. Whereas in the actual exam I didn't feel that level of exhaustion maybe because of the adrenaline. 

Revised 100 concepts of anatomy and FA Rapid review a day before the exam. Just glanced through the Reddit post of 100hy concepts seeing if there was something new because didn't have time to actually go through each of those on the last day. 

The exam day was a little easier for me because I'd given the free120 at the same centre a week before and that had helped me familiarise myself to the protocol and the centre as a whole. I took a 5-15 min break between every 2 blocks till block 6, then took a long break before block 7 and had some black coffee (had a latte and a banana before the exam). I'm a GERD patient so I'd packed a lot of snacks and kept snacking in the breaks. Also stayed hydrated throughout. 
The questions are much longer than the NBMEs so please be prepared for that (missed 5-6qs total), but the exam is doable.

I apologise for the long post, id promised my self if I passed id post my whole journey - the low NBME scores, incomplete uworld and the missed questions. 
This sub helped me a lot and I'll be willing to help out, feel free to ask any other questions you have in the comments.

All the best!!!",6,1755008459.0,step1,14,1.0,False
1moa1to,https://www.reddit.com/r/PinoyUnsentLetters/comments/1moa1to/a_gentle_reminder_for_the_days_you_forget_yourself/,A Gentle Reminder for the Days You Forget Yourself,"I hope you read this slowly, maybe with your coffee or while your dogs are quietly curled up near you. This is not a pep talk. This is a reminder.

You’ve been in motion for a long time. Juggling work, ambitions, responsibilities, and ideas that are bigger than most people realize. You carry a lot, and sometimes you forget that the weight you bear is not the measure of your worth.

Right now, I think what you need isn’t another massive leap, but a steady breath. A quiet, deliberate choice to check in with yourself, not just your to-do list. You’ve been great at showing up for tasks, deadlines, and other people. But it’s time to show up for yourself in the same way: consistently, without guilt, and without waiting for “the right time.”

If I could suggest one improvement for you, it’s this:
Don’t just plan for the next big move. Plan for your energy to still be there when you get there. You have dreams that deserve a version of you that’s rested, clear, and joyful, not burnt out and running on fumes.

And one more thing: stop downplaying how far you’ve come. You’ve survived things you don’t even talk about anymore, adapted to roles most people wouldn’t dare take, and kept your sense of humor intact. That is no small feat.

So take the pause when you need it. Let yourself enjoy the small wins without rushing to the next thing. Be as patient with yourself as you are persistent with your goals. You are already becoming the person you once hoped you’d be.

With quiet confidence,
Someone rooting for you, always",2,1755008457.0,PinoyUnsentLetters,1,1.0,False
