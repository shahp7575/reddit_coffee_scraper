Employee morale is a cornerstone of workplace productivity, engagement, and retention. While many organizations invest in wellness programs and team-building activities, one simple yet powerful solution is often overlooked: installing vending machines in the workplace.

For Sacramento-based offices, schools, and facilities, vending machines offer more than just convenience, they contribute to a culture of care, accessibility, and daily satisfaction.

# Convenience That Supports Well-Being

In fast-paced environments, employees often skip meals or settle for quick, unhealthy options due to time constraints. A strategically placed vending machine provides easy access to snacks, beverages, and even healthier alternatives right within the workplace.

This convenience encourages short, restorative breaks and helps maintain energy levels throughout the day. When employees feel their needs are considered, they’re more likely to stay focused, productive, and loyal.

# Coffee Vending Machines: Fueling Focus and Connection

Coffee is more than a morning ritual; it’s a productivity tool and a social connector. On-site [coffee vending machines](https://musthavevending.com/coffee-services/) eliminate the need for off-site coffee runs, saving time and keeping employees engaged.

These stations often become informal gathering spots, fostering spontaneous conversations and collaboration. A simple cup of coffee can spark ideas, reduce stress, and strengthen team dynamics.

# Celebrating Wins with Treats

Recognizing achievements and milestones is essential for maintaining morale. Ice cream vending machines or snack stations can be used to celebrate project completions, birthdays, or team successes. These small gestures create lasting impressions and reinforce a positive workplace culture.

Even spontaneous treats can lift spirits and show appreciation, especially in high-pressure environments.

# Hassle-Free Installation and Maintenance

Modern vending solutions are designed to be effortless. Businesses in Sacramento can benefit from free installation, customized product selection, and ongoing maintenance without any upfront costs.

From stocking to servicing, everything is handled professionally, ensuring machines remain clean, functional, and filled with items employees actually want. Whether it’s snacks, beverages, coffee, or frozen treats, vending options can be tailored to suit any workplace.

# Local Expertise That Understands Sacramento Work Culture

Choosing a local provider ensures faster service, personalized support, and a deeper understanding of regional preferences. Sacramento businesses benefit from responsive communication and flexible solutions that national providers often overlook.

Working with a local team means your vending setup is aligned with your company’s values, employee needs, and operational goals.

# A Simple Step Toward a Happier Workplace

Boosting morale doesn’t require a major investment. Vending machines offer a low-maintenance, high-impact way to improve employee satisfaction, encourage healthier habits, and create a more positive work environment.

Whether you manage an office, school, or facility, vending solutions can help you build a workplace where convenience meets care and where employees feel truly supported.

1ni9rg5,https://i.redd.it/fnmnok3eygpf1.jpeg,The Time Has Come... heh heh.,"Perry promised he'd already be there whenever Jasmine decided to visit. It's an easy promise to keep, just a little stable loop here or there. But... he needed more time. 

Half an before Jasmine's arrival, Perry has haunted himself. 

Tykor, he wasn't an Astral Elf found a slum within mined out asteroid who dreamed of seeing what the stars looked like before they all died. 

Dramini, she had never impressed him by accurately predicting complex causality chains with pure psychohistoric calculation done in her pretty, Plasmoid head. 

Pastor-Epsilon, the arcano-mechanical priest had never used the holy symbol of its faith as the mathematical basis for its Synchronox's fractal structure. 

None of these people had ever been or done anything, because they were never born and never could be. They didn't exist. He made sure of it. 

Doesn't make sitting with them any easier. 

Perry looks between these Temporal Ghosts, smiling, frozen echoes plucked from the only timeline that would ever remember them; his own.

""I'm still sorry, guys. I failed you, failed us. I saw talent and wit, failed to see else was hurting inside you... I'm doing it right, this time. Jasmine? You wouldn't believe this girl! She's been through so much lately, and already wields some *scary* power, but... she's still good, better than good. I love her... you would've, too, before you all... okay.""

The moment Jasmine's knuckles touch the apartment door, time stops for her and everything other than Perry. He disperses his ghosts, reaching elsewhen into his past as he produces other ghosts, the translucent phantoms of the greatest literary works on Chronomancy ever produced, arranging them all neatly on the coffee table along with a tray of homemade donuts and a covered bowl filled with dead mice.

He steels himself, choosing his love to preside over his fears, and resumes time as he opens the door with a smile.

Da Nang is overrated. I’ve been here for a week now and it’s poor, the excursion was decent but other than that, there’s a beach which is massively busy, and the only other things to do (again in my opinion) are go to coffee shops or go to the gym. The market is terrible, the reason digital nomads think it’s so good is because they’re sat staring at a computer screen all day, in a bloody coffee shop. 

Again all down to personal opinion, but Da Nang is basically the Hua Hin of Vietnam. I’m being real, not gonna sit here and force myself to enjoy it or make myself believe that it’s the best place since sliced bread just because I’m travelling and ‘have to make the most of it’ like other travellers do, but it’s pretty overrated 🤣 

I’ve walked practically everywhere, best thing about Da Nang is the Athena barbers, great service. Other than that, I don’t really rate it.

Me (24f) and my fiance (25m) live in the shed in my parents' property and pay rent for it. I see my parents and brother a few times a week, but otherwise I'm really busy with studying for a full-time uni course (psychology majoring neuroscience), studying an extracurricular business course and trying to open a business. Obviously on top of the usual house maintainance and cooking which I share with my fiance. 

For context regarding the family dynamic, it is not good. My father has threatened to beat me up/punch me in the face thrice (1st time was when i went for a sleep-over to my fiance's/ then boyfriend's house when I was 22 without permission, 2nd time was when I was 23 and he didnt ""approve"" of me going to a date with my fiance/then boyfriend, 3rd time was when my mother wanted me to show her my texts between me and my fiance and I refused. We lived in the shed back then too, but they kicked him out because he was driving a car with expired registration and threatened to beat him up too - she wanted us to break up and wanted to see what we are talking about). After the 3rd incident I moved out with my fiance into his caravan, and left a letter behind explaining why I left which boils down to ""I'm a grown adult, you cannot threaten to beat me up for not making the choices you want"". After a few weeks away my parents were begging for us to return and approximately a month after that we moved back in with them to try to mend things. 

Things were good for a bit, but then they started trying to start some sort of feud between my now direct family (me and fiance) and them. We agreed that we would be responsible for mowing the lawn, and then they started requiring us to mow it when it hasn't yet grown back (the lawn mower wouldnt even make a divet on the grass, even at the lowest setting/closest to the ground) and would start cussing him out to me for not mowing the lawn whenever they wanted to, despite the grass still being very short - the grass has died at one spot because of their requests because it is too short and we have a dog that pooped that spot into suffocation (not sure if thats the cause lol but that is when it started. That spot is now just a muddy patch). They then started asking me to apologise for pointing out how the threats of violence that my father made were unjustifiable. Saying that I don't care for them, that Im cold, a donkey, how ""I used to be so smart"" etc.

I feel like the potential asshole, because I haven't made a significant effort to spend time with them, don't really make a significant effort to sit down and have a coffee with them etc. The reason is that they stress me out and every conversation turns back into what I talked about in the previous paragraph. I hate that I'm a financial situation where I have no other option for housing, and don't want to be like those adult children that mooch off their parents until they are kicked out and then complain.

# Read Link: [**https://writers.bitlifeappspro.com/wanted-1/**](https://writers.bitlifeappspro.com/wanted-1/)

Just because I blacklisted my boyfriend’s first love’s salon, he dumped me-five months pregnant-in the Olympic wilderness. 

Ten years together, Jake was always the perfect boyfriend. 

Until he took me to his first love-Bethany’s hair salon for a haircut. 

She butchered my hair on PURPOSE. 

My modeling agency banned her salon after the massacre. 

Jake’s payback? Left me for dead in those mountains. 

After seven days crawling through hell, what did I hear when I finally made it back? 

“Come on, it was just a little lesson. Thinks she’s hot shit? She’s knocked up with nowhere to go-she’ll crawl back like she always does.” 

That’s when something inside me snapped. 

I booked the abortion that same hour. 

Jake thought he had me trapped? 

Big Mistake-the trap was all HIS! 

“Dude, look at her-totally let herself go. Even her own family’s cutting her off. And she’s still trying to come for Bethany? Over some hair? Just pay the damn fee and move on. She messed with Beth, now she’s paying for it.” 

I stood frozen outside the door, Jake’s words hitting me like a punch to the gut. 

Seven days fighting my way through those mountains, covered in mud and soaked from constant rain. 

Right up until this moment, I’d been praying-hoping against hope-that someone else had left me out there to die. 

“Jake, man, aren’t you worried she’ll find out and dump your ass?” 

Jake let out this cold laugh. 

“Whatever. She’s stuck with me now. Nobody else is gonna touch her, and she’s totally obsessed with me anyway. Pretty sad, 

honestly.” 

Jake’s words sliced through me like razor blades. 

He was dead certain I’d never leave him. 

I forced out this bitter smile and ran to the corner store to use their phone. 

“Dad? It’s me, Mia.” 

His irritated voice came through loud and clear: 

Hiking Trin? Honey His Duneral Was My Comeback Tour! 

00 

“Why are you calling me? I dumped your stuff outside. Figure it out yourself. Don’t call me again-you’re a disgrace!” 

Click. 

He hung up before I could say another word. 

Jake was right. Nobody wanted me anymore. 

Even my own father had given up on me. 

Ten years ago, Jake saved my life after that climbing accident. Gave me a second chance. 

He said my eyes were the most beautiful thing he’d ever seen. 

Later I figured out the truth-my eyes looked exactly like Bethany’s. 

He’d been looking through me at her this whole damn time. 

I walked barefoot through the rain straight into the hospital. 

“Hi, I need to schedule an abortion.” 

After all the tests, the doctor shook her head: 

“Look, you’re not eating enough and you’re really weak. Your uterus is pretty thin, and you’re far along. If you do this, you might not be able to get pregnant again. Ever.” 

My face went white, hands shaking. 

“Just do it.” 

I couldn’t even take care of myself. How could I be selfish enough to bring a baby into this nightmare? 

Surgery scheduled for next week. 

I dragged my broken body home. 

“Mia, Jesus, look at you. What a mess. Can’t sit still even when you’re knocked up.” 

Jake’s voice was pure mockery. 

His friends were all snickering behind their hands. 

He’d been acting for ten years straight. Ten years of my heart down the drain. 

I didn’t respond, just headed upstairs. 

Funny how that oversized wedding portrait of us looking so in love is still hanging above the bed. 

Oh, right. I’d almost forgotten-our wedding was supposed to be next month. 

Probably just another chance for him to humiliate me, wasn’t it? 

Timing it perfectly for when I’d really start showing. 

Let everyone see the knocked-up bride. 

My phone buzzed with messages from my agent. 

She’d managed to buy me some time on that three-hundred-thousand-dollar penalty. 

Now I felt nothing but bitterness. 

Dead end, no way out. 

That night, Jake spooned me from behind, his hand on my belly. 

“You and the baby… you’re both okay, right?” 

Chapter 2 

“Yeah.” 

I closed my eyes, voice flat as concrete. 

Jake’s hand jerked-he was shocked by how cold I sounded. 

“Jake, do you love me?” 

No hesitation whatsoever. 

“Of course I do.” 

Right on cue, his phone started buzzing. 

Bethany’s crying came through crystal clear: 

“Jake, I had that nightmare again where you left me. I’m so scared. Please don’t get married. Please don’t leave me.” 

Jake’s voice got all panicked and urgent: 

“Beth, hey, don’t cry. That’ll never happen. I’m coming over right now.” 

After hanging up, he glanced at my back. 

“Mia, quit being dramatic. I said I’d marry you and I meant it. Just take care of yourself and the baby.” 

Maybe realizing he’d gone too far this time, Jake was suddenly playing concerned boyfriend. 

With that, he rushed out. 

In his eyes, I was still just the girl who could never measure up to her. 

I got up and stared at all our old couple photos. 

Ever since Bethany came back, we hadn’t taken a single picture together. 

At 3 AM, Bethany posted on Instagram- 

Jake driving all over Seattle at midnight hunting down her favorite boba. 

A shot of him cooking her breakfast at dawn. 

Things I’d never experienced. 

Jake always told me to “be more understanding.” 

And I never asked for anything. 

Turns out he didn’t need understanding girls-he just didn’t want ME making demands. 

1 ripped every single photo of 

Just like all those little wounds Jake inflicted, thinking they didn’t matter. 

Next morning, I ripped down every wedding decoration in the house. 

Just then, the front door clicked open. 

And Bethany waltzed in like she owned the place. 

“Mia, look at yourself-you really think you can compete with me?” 

She wasn’t beating around the bush. 

I wasn’t shocked to see Bethany here. 

“Yeah, what?” My voice was flat. 

“Sweetie, if you don’t want me here, I’ll go. I just wanted to help out. Jake said you haven’t been feeling good.” 

Suddenly Bethany switched to this syrupy-sweet act. 

Which meant Jake was about to show up. 

Her razor-sharp nails dug into my baby bump. 

I instinctively protected my stomach and shoved her hand away. 

Bethany let out this theatrical scream and deliberately slammed her head into the coffee table. 

Blood trickled down her cheek in a perfect little stream. 

“BETHANY!” 

Jake burst in carrying suitcases, dropping everything to rush to his precious princess. 

“I’m okay, Jake. Mia’s probably just hormonal, you know? Don’t be mad at her—I shouldn’t have just showed up.” 

Tears mixed with blood as she grabbed his sleeve like some tragic heroine. 

“Mia, what the FUCK is wrong with you?! Over and over you target Beth. Can’t you just leave her the hell alone?” 

Jake pointed at me like I’d committed first-degree murder. 

“Jake, don’t. She’s probably just… you know, with the baby and everything. I’m fine, really. I just want her to be happy.” 

Bethany tugged on his sleeve with this perfect wounded-angel expression. 

“Please, stop with the constant doubts. If I really did hook up with Beth, do you honestly think you could compete with her? Look at yourself-Jesus, fat as hell.” 

Chapter 3 

I stood there silent through Jake’s entire meltdown. 

Before, I would’ve been on my knees begging forgiveness by now. 

Not anymore. Never again. 

After this long, awkward silence, Jake looked genuinely confused by my lack of reaction. 

He seemed puzzled that I was staying so damn calm. 

“You done? I’m tired.” 

Then I walked to my room without explaining myself or caring who might leave. 

¢ 

That night Jake climbed into bed and wrapped his arms around me. 

“Mia, I’m exhausted lately. Just behave and quit going after Beth. Wedding’s next month. I promised you that and I’ll keep my word, okay?” 

Jake buried his face in my hair, gently rubbing my belly. 

“Mm-hmm.” 

Flat response, zero emotion. 

I didn’t want the wedding. Didn’t want the baby. Didn’t want anything tied to him. 

Keep your damn promises-I don’t need them. 

Next day, Jake dragged Bethany and me to hang with his crew. 

He said I’d be “more comfortable” in the back seat. 

I closed my eyes, listening to Jake and Bethany chat away up front. 

All their inside jokes and shared memories. None of it included me. 

At the bar, it was the usual crowd-Jake’s asshole buddies. 

All of them were Team Bethany. 

“Holy shit, the wife and the mistress, side by side like besties! Man, talk about living the dream!” 

One of his asshole friends cracked up at his own joke. 

“Stop it! Mia’s having a baby-I could never compare. Jake and I aren’t even like that!” 

Bethany covered her face, all fake-bashful. 

“Cut it out, guys.” 

Jake frowned but didn’t sound too bothered. 

“Mia, sit here,” 

Jake pulled out a chair for me, then immediately did the same for Bethany. 

When the server brought drinks, Jake stopped them from pouring Bethany any alcohol. 

“Skip her-Beth turns red when she drinks.” 

I stared at my already-full wine glass and laughed bitterly. 

4 

During their stupid drinking games, someone suggested spin the bottle. 

First spin landed on Bethany. 

They dared her to pick someone for the pocky game. 

Bethany fake-bashfully covered her face, then pointed at Jake all giggly. 

“Jake, would you… help me out?” 

Jake glanced at me, saw my blank expression, and shrugged. “Yeah, whatever.” 

Their faces got closer while everyone whooped and cheered. 

Apparently everyone forgot I was supposed to be Jake’s bride. ",1,1758002697.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

She's been dealing with chronic GERD for a few years now and it seems like no matter what she does or takes, her symptoms remain unresolved and I wanted to see if others have gone through something similar or have any suggestions.

She avoids caffeine, coffee, acidic foods, fermented foods, etc etc. She avoids eating close to bedtime and sleeps with her pillow elevated. I believe she's on pantoprazole right now. She was on omeprazole before but I don't think that helped her. She had H. pylori a few years ago that was treated and she recently had an EGD where they found H. pylori again. Her EGD was overall negative and she just finished her abx for the H. pylori. Her big issue is that she gets a burning sensation a few hours after she eats and usually snacking on a little something helps relieve symptoms. Sometimes it doesn't. And she says it's a different sensation from when she's hungry and her stomach is churning. Sometimes she feels the urge to burp, and sometimes she doesn't. It seems like her symptoms are random so it's hard to pinpoint a specific cause.

I told her the GI doctor suggested cutting gluten bc gluten intolerance can cause symptoms. She had some burning yesterday, but she claimed she had no gluten. I believe she went to her primary today to test for Celiac.

Hey! My name is Nick, I'm 28, and I currently live in North Texas. As per my title and various puns, I do work in finance and have been in the industry for about four and a half years. Before this, I worked in contracting and water damage restoration for another four and a half years. I can rebuild your house and then file your taxes. 

Physically, I'm 6' tall but 6'2 when I put on my boots. White, brown hair, brown eyes. I go to the gym but I also like to eat. I have a few tattoos here and there and would like some more. 

For hobbies, I'm super into Formula 1 and a good amount into baseball, football, and hockey. I also enjoy gaming in my free time, reading a book from time to time, making and enjoying coffee, camping, and overall just exploring the city. I also enjoy listening to music and I've had the new Sabrina Carpenter album on repeat since it came out, but I like almost all genres of music and am always open to new recs. I keep myself busy and occupied most days. 

I want to be clear that I am not here looking for a relationship. I would just like friends to talk to and fill my free time with.

# February 3rd -



  I woke up to my phone ringing, its vibrations dispersing into my night stand. Maybe if I turned over and went back to sleep, the phone would stop ringing and I’d be able to slip back into the wonderful dream I’d been having. Sadly, my unrealistic hope remained unrealistic.The phone kept ringing—and ringing—and ringing. Eventually, it stopped, but just as I was about to drift back into sleep, it started again. Even though the same thing happens every morning, its repetition still pissed me off.  I grabbed my phone, saw the same number I’d seen time and time again, and threw it across the room. With my sleep-addled brain, I had helpfully taken my anger out on an inanimate object. Sometimes my rationality surprises even myself.



“Can’t you bother someone else!?!”



I shouted in frustration, feeling a slight sense of joy as my phone slammed into the wall, the ringing fading into nothing but a faint vibration. I doubted it cracked it, it had survived much worse. Now that the vibrations were muffled by the carpet, I thought about trying to go back to sleep, but I knew it would be a futile effort.



  How did I know that? Well that's because this happens every morning, at least every morning for the past two weeks. During these two weeks, an unknown number has called me at exactly 2:14 in the morning. I don’t answer, at least not anymore.  The first time, on January 20th, I answered.



\~



“Hello? Who is this?” I said in a groggy daze. Noticing the time, I added, “Couldn’t you call me at a better hour?” The person on the other end didn’t respond to any of my fatigued questions. Instead, they spoke a single word:“Twenty-Five.”



  The voice sounded fake. It was flat, each syllable pronounced separately with an unnaturally long pause between “twenty” and “five.” It reminded me of the early models of AI voices. It repeated the word with an interval of 30 seconds between each iteration. I thought it was a prank call or some elaborate scam that tries to take clips of your voice to scam others. I hung up, not realising how much that call would change.



\~



  After having dealt with this a few times, I knew just to let it ring and they'll give up after the second try, but I was wrong. They tried to call me 5 whole times before I was at my breaking point. I shot out of bed, stomping over to my phone. My phone lay there screen up, the number I had grown to hate shining up at me. I picked up my phone, slid the answer button to the right, and let out the anger that had built up for the past 2 weeks.



“Listen here you -”



“Eleven”



I froze, my tirade dying on my lips. Eleven? I had expected Twenty-Five like the first time.



“What’s Eleven? What do you mean? Eleven Days? Eleven calls left? What do you mean by Eleven?”



The voice remained silent, as I should have expected, simply repeating “Eleven”.



  I hung up, my mind running with questions. Was someone threatening me? Were they counting down the days like some sort of low budget Ring rip-off? Was I over reacting because I had watched too many hour long serial killer iceberg videos? The answer to the last one was probably, but the first two remained scarily unanswered. Although, the counting days theory may have some merit.



  I walked over to the calendar hanging on my wall, scanning the page for January 20th. Once I found it, I found twenty five days later, February 14th. Valentine’s Day? What’s happening Valentine’s Day? I looked at the date with the heart drawn in red marker, with text written in it saying “Date Night!!”. Nothing's happening anymore, I thought bitterly.



 I had broken up with my girlfriend of three years around a month ago. It wasn’t because of a fight or cheating, but something I argue is worse. Me and Sara just weren’t meant to be. We had different ideas on what to do with our lives, and slowly came to the realization that for us to be happy we needed to be able to go and live life in our own ways. It’s one of the worst feelings I’ve ever felt, knowing you and the person you love fit together *almost* perfectly, but you can't make the pieces fall in place the way they need to. We left on good terms, deciding to be friends, but we hadn’t actually talked in a while. On the Valentine’s Day date I had planned on proposing, but now the ring that she had picked out lies collecting dust in a closet.



 I reigned in my focus from the past to focus on the situation I was faced. The call had been counting down every single time I hadn’t answered. Now I have eleven days until… what? I didn’t really want to know what this unknown number had in mind. Maybe it didn’t have to get that far? Maybe I should call the police and see if they could trace the phone call like they do in the movies? Yeah maybe that could work, it could be nothing but it would be nice to know that it actually is nothing. I had quickly thrown on a t-shirt and already walked out the door before remembering that it was still 2:45. While I could call the police station this early and a police officer would come, I didn’t want to wake Mike up just because I was a little scared of a phone call.  There are around four hundred police departments in the USA with a one man police force, and sadly I was in the jurisdiction of one of them.



  I decided that since I couldn’t really go anywhere this early besides the 24-hour convenience store on the other side of town, I’d sit on the porch of my house and watch the snow-fall. I went into the house, brewed a fresh pot of coffee, grabbed a blanket, and sat on the porch swing. The night was quiet and peaceful, the snow lightly falling onto the sleeping earth. For around an hour no one was disturbing the peace, until a car drove by. It was dark and the car had its lights off, so I couldn’t see the car or who was driving it. Now, I wish I had. The car drove by the house slowly, barely making a sound. It drove down the road disappearing out of sight. Must be a member of the night shift crowd. That's what I thought for about an hour, until I heard a twig snap about fifty feet away. My head immediately snapped towards the sound. Is there somebody out there? Am I not alone? With the falling snow and darkness I could not see the source of the sound, but I knew something was there. I stood up and moved to the railings of the porch trying to get a better look.



“Hello? Is anybody there?” I asked, immediately regretting the question. What did I expect? Did I really expect the serial killer to stroll up and announce, *Oh, hello! I’m just a serial killer here to kill you, but since you asked nicely I’ll bake you a cake instead*?



Thankfully I didn’t receive an answer, instead I received a faceful of blinding light and a clicking noise. Though the light quickly went away, the after effects did not. I sat there for a few seconds squinting my pained eyes as I was temporarily blinded by the flash. While I was blinded, I heard the sounds of quick footfall moving away from me. Someone was running, and fast by the sounds of it. The crunching of the snow under their feet giving away each step, I would’ve gone after them, but I probably would be putting myself in more danger with the state I was in. As my vision began to clear I started moving over to where I had heard the twig snapping. Maybe there was something to identify the stalker? Once I got about where I heard it, I saw a box on the ground. The box was wrapped neatly in pink wrapping paper adorned with golden hearts. I noticed it had a card taped onto it but I couldn’t read it cause it was dark. I scooped up the package, it wasn’t too heavy but there was definitely something sliding around in there every time I moved it. 



  I took the box inside to my kitchen table so I could see under better lighting. The card was in an envelope with the words “First of Many” in red glittery lettering. Under that it said “To Nathan Filmont” in a smaller version of that same lettering. I opened the envelope carefully, making sure not to damage it in case I needed to take it to the police. Inside the envelope there was a cartoon dog holding a box of chocolates on the outside of the card, with text saying “a SWEET poem for you!”. I opened the card to have too things fall out of it, one a torn out page of a notebook, and a white paper square. The notebook page had the following written on it:



*Lucky Day*



*I made you a token so small and neat,*  
*Took something broken and made it so sweet!*



*People say a rabbit’s foot brings cheer,*  
*A pocket talisman to hold dear*



*I know it’s not a rabbit’s foot,*  
*but still think you will appreciate your old friend Gil*



  I froze when I got to the last sentence. My Mastiff’s name was Gill (actually named Gilbert Archibald Henry the Fourteenth because of an old family joke), what did this have to do with him? He had been missing for a little under a month now and I had been looking for him. I had even put up those old “Missing” posters. I would have done everything to get him found, except put him on a milk carton cause I don’t want him lost forever. If this someone had any idea what happened to him or anything I would have to track them down.



  I turned my attention to the little square of paper no bigger than my palm. I picked it up and was able to see it was the back of a polaroid. Who still uses polaroids? I flip it over and my blood runs cold, the picture is of me in my backyard playing with my dog. The picture was taken through the bars of the gate that leads to my front yard. Not only that,  I was only about 5 feet away from the camera. How did I not notice anyone taking the picture? This would’ve had to have been taken two months ago at the very least. I put down the photo next to the poem. What is this? What sick and twisted game was this person trying to play? I looked at the things in front of me, only the box was left now. I started ripping the wrapping paper off the box, noticing there were more layers. I started taking off layer after layer of paper until I was left with a box, every inch covered in packaging tape. I grabbed a box knife and cut a slit on top, revealing a putrid smell. It smelt like rotting meat and glue. I didn’t throw up, not yet. I wouldn’t have to wait long to though, as I opened up the box I saw a mix of blood, glitter, glue, and confetti hearts. I stood up, immediately getting light headed. I walked over to the sink,  emptying the contents of last night’s spaghetti into it. I grabbed my phone and called Mike, it was 5 o’clock, he’s had plenty of time to sleep. It rang a few times before our old and groggy sheriff answered.



“Hello? Is this an emergency?” Mike spoke into the phone hoping that he good go back to sleep.

He’s a really nice guy and despite having a rough time itself (again, I don’t want to go into detail, but I will say he didn’t have a home to go back to after being discharged and his health wasn’t great either).

He would go out of his way to pay for other people’s coffee in the cafeteria and he even got me a gift which was really special.

He’s having an even harder time now and I want to get him something the same way he did me when I was really struggling.

But I (25F) have no idea what gifts a 40-50 year old man would be interested in lol! It’s also tricky since he is in the hospital and it’s uncertain how long he’ll be here. And the living situation after is uncertain. So I don’t want to give him something that would be a burden in any way (like hard to take with him or he can’t keep).

Aaron J killed it although I missed a lot of it cuz I was peeing every 10 mins from drinking a bunch of coffee and water before arriving lol. Tbh I couldn’t tell you much about Antenes set other than it got me into a perfect trance like state for dancing, so much so that I wasn’t thinking about the music at all, and my body was just a vehicle for it to play out physically.

Now Dozzy! I had heard great things about him and I knew he was a legend but never got around to listening to a mix so his style caught me by surprise. The best way I could describe it is having restraint. He played at a relatively slow bpm with a lot of stripped back atmospheric percussive tracks. Suuuper classy. People always talk about telling a story with a set but I rarely ever feel like I witness it. With Dozzy it felt like there was always somewhere else to go after each track. Rather than being “there” in the peak intensity moment, which realistically can only last so long it felt cinematic with slow twists and turns. Unfortunately is was extremely overpacked so there was no room to dance and people were being quite pushy. I kept taking breaks thinking somehow it’d clear out but it only got worse. Definitely put a damper on the experience.

That said, if anyone has any mix/label recommendations for this style of techno, it’s definitely something I wanna explore more and that I feel like the scene could use right now with a lot of stuff leaning into high bpm aggressive maximalist tracks that can certainly be fun and attention grabbing but get boring/repetitive quite quickly.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.

1. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

1. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

1. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

1. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

1. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.

1. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

1. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

1. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).

* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.

* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).

* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.

* Taking vitamin and mineral supplements (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. Protein shakes before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

1. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

1. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

And: how many days to get used to it?,"Hello, 36yo in Australia here trying medication for the first time. I’m on day 2; starting small taking half a tablet of quick release dex in the morning and midday.

Feeling pretty weird/gross right now; not quite a headache but my head feels kinda pressure-y.  Felt like I’d had too much coffee earlier. Leg jiggling, found it hard to stay in office and look at screens, had to go run errands instead. Now I still don’t want to do work, lying on the couch.

Another weird thing I’ve noticed is yesterday and today I’ve been SO HUNGRY all day; I thought these meds were supposed to have the opposite effect 😅

Now I know I might have to wait a week for my body to get used to it.

What I’m wondering is, is it possible that a higher dose will actually feel less weird? I’m thinking about when I’ve been at festivals with people talking about taking various recreational drugs or even just alcohol - I’ve heard people say having a small amount will make you feel weird, nauseous, sleepy etc but there’s a certain hump you have to get over with taking enough and then it has the desired effect. So I’m wondering if the same might be true here?

Or maybe dex just isn’t right for me and I’ll need to try something different.

Or maybe I’ll feel better in a few days.

On that note: I am doing a really important project next week. If I’m still feeling gross by Friday (day 5) should I stop then, will I need a couple days to crash/recover? 
Or should I keep going til Sunday to make sure it’s not just needing to adjust, and then not take them next Monday? 

Yes, I will ask my pharmacist/doctor these things, but I already called them with questions yesterday so just trying not to be too annoying 😅",5,1757999722.0,adhdwomen,3,1.0,False

Some information I am sharing after reading this sub

\- The needle doesn't bulge. I tightened it fully clockwise and rotated reverse one rotation. No use.

\- I don't get any back pressure while pressing, I am able to press smoothly (maybe the grind is not fine enough) but could this cause the issue - I was thinking this would atleast make the needle move a bit.

\- I will try to see if I can attach some other pressure device and get to have the gauge move, but will need to get that device.

1ni8n7m,https://www.reddit.com/r/humansarespaceorcs/comments/1ni8n7m/the_end_of_all/,The End of All,"I sit in the cramped cockpit of my ship, the hum of the cloaking field barely audible over the rhythm of my own breathing. The craft, no larger than a terrestrial van, clung to the shadowed surface of an asteroid drifting lazily through the Thrakan system. From outside, it looked like nothing more than another shard of rock caught in the empire’s endless void. Inside, though, my displays flickered with information, stellar charts, proximity warnings, silent scans of Thrakan patrol routes. 

Beyond the reinforced canopy, space was a haunting tapestry. Stars burned cold against the dark, casting fractured light across the asteroid’s jagged face. Closer in, I could see the faint gleam of Thrakan stations and the disciplined arcs of their patrol wings, steel forms prowling their territory with predatory patience. I felt the weight of their presence like pressure on my chest, the knowledge that one miscalculation would mean my mission failure. I drew a slow breath, settling deeper into the pilot’s chair. For now, I am just another shadow in the void, waiting for the moment when silence would give way to action.

They had strapped the payload in while the engineers spoke in clipped, careful sentences that meant more to each other than to anything I would understand. I can read the displays well enough, a handful of icons that promise a route through space I don’t pretend to understand. The new wormhole rig is a black box to me, a miracle wrapped in a scientists hen scratchings. What I do understand is the plan is crude and cruel. simple outline, I ride the shuttle sized shell down through a ring the rig will punch into the planet’s gravity well. Once on the surface the system will open again and receive and marry a tiny shard, something ripped from a dead star into the payload. The technicians avoided all the equations and used only the words that matter, “synchronization,” “trigger,” and finally, “irreversible.” Thirty minutes, they said. Thirty minutes from the moment the shard closes with the payload until the rest of the world is gone. Me first, crushed instantly in the newly created black hole. 

Inside the cramped cockpit, the hum of reactors and the soft chirp of telemetry is a kind of prayer I never loved. My eyes hover over controls I will barely touch, the ship will function more on a preprogrammed algorithm that will make it so I don’t even have to pilot the craft . I think of small things, my sister’s crooked grin in a photograph taped to the console, the way the vacuum smells of ozone when vents cycle and of large things I do not deserve to control. I do not know the fine points of neutron star or the calculations of spacetime, but I know what “destroy the planet” means. A silence larger than death that will swallow cities and histories. My stomach tightens when I imagine the countdown, and then I press my forehead to the glass and steady my breath. If this is the last honest thing I can do, then I will be a shadow on a rock until the world ends; I will be the instrument that keeps my people alive by unmaking everything else. The timer on the console blinks once, slow and indifferent, and the single digit at the edge of the display creeps toward the next minute.

Myself and countless others like me are the sharp edge of a final, terrible stick. The Thrakans were winning world by world, fleet by fleet, erasing humanity with a methodical fury that left no room for mercy. The war of annihilation had dragged on for decades, burning through systems one at a time. Every negotiation, every plea for reason had died in the void. Humanity had begged for a truce, sent envoys to the Synod—the great galactic body sworn to preserve balance—but the Synod only whispered from their high seats, too afraid to challenge the Thrakan war machine. Fear had silenced justice, and in that silence, humanity had been left to its fate.

But the decades of desperation had not been idle. In the shadows, away from the front lines, humanity had perfected its single miracle, wormhole technology. First, they had used it to scatter their seed across the stars colony ships hurled into the deep edges of the galaxy and even into the dark between galaxies, small sparks carried far from the coming storm. But wormholes could be used for more than flight. They could be made into weapons. And so the order had gone out. If the Thrakans would not stop, then their worlds would burn. Not one or two, but thousands. I sit in my tiny cloaked craft, tethered to an asteroid, knowing I am one of countless men and women carrying payloads that would pull a sliver of a dead star into a planet’s heart. Thirty minutes of panic and tearing of planet and atmosphere, then nothingness. A grim calculation born of desperation, the survival of a scattered humanity bought with the death of an empire.

My sister’s photo is taped crooked against the console, a smudge of my finger oil on the corner where I keep my thumb when I think of home. She was fifteen when the Thrakan raiders took the colony ring, Anna with a laugh that could split a pitch black night with joy and a habit of stealing the captain’s coffee. I still hear the recording from the evacuation frequency, a single clipped voice shouting coordinates and then nothing but static. they tell you that static is the sound of ships being ripped apart. Sometimes, in this tiny ship, I can feel the hollow where she should be, like a missing tooth. There are faces too, my mother’s hands folded in a video that froze on the day the orbitals went dark; a neighbor who taught me to fix a fuel pump and died because the Thrakans cared for nothing but annihilation. Loss has a weight that refuses to be rationalized away. It sits with me in the cockpit, presses cold against my soul. I carry them like ballast, and I count them as the price that brought me here.

Duty is a blunt thing. It is not noble like in the stories people tell. It is small, ugly, and practical. I’m not proud of the number on my payload or the mechanics that will splice a shard of neutron star into machine and spawn a worm hole. I’m not a sermon maker. I am a man who cleans his visor, tucks a photograph into a corner, and does what must be done because someone else failed to stand where they should have. The Synod folded, diplomats whispered and walked away, and the councils that promised balance preferred their safe silence to confrontation. So the burden falls to us the engineers, pilots, soldiers and the ones who will be shadows on rocks until the sky melts. I don’t pretend I like it. I don’t pretend the thought of ending whole worlds doesn’t turn my stomach. But when I close my eyes I can see the handful of children whose ship made it through the last jump, hopefully finding a safe place to start over. I can see the colonies we’ve seeded at the galaxy’s ragged edges. If my death makes room for their breath, then I will up cinch these straps and do it. My willingness is angry, bitter, and resolute, an unhappy covenant. I will burn so others may live.

The console flickers to life like an animal answering a call. For a breathless second I think it’s just another loop of diagnostics, then the comm indicator steadies. It is time. I take a deep breath, look at Anna one more time. I punch the Thrakan frequency  into the transmitter because someone decided the last courtesy we owed our enemy was to speak in their own language. My throat is dry; the words feel foreign in my mouth, but the translation runs across the feed in a steady, cold voice I do not recognize as mine. “This is the furthest edge of your victory. Turn away we asked or witness what desperation has wrought. Now witness.” I hit send and watched the little packet of data arc into the Thrakan net an insult and an elegy. I flip on the power to the worm rig. There is no fanfare. There is only the timer, a metronome in the belly of the van-sized coffin, and the steady, uncanny calm of something that knows its work perfectly.

The jump is less like falling than being unmade. Gravity loosens its grip and the cockpit fills with a pressure that is not quite pain, more like thought being peeled away from the body. The rig opens a throat in spacetime and spits us down through a ring so tight I can feel my teeth complaining in my skull. We arrive on the surface just where the engineers programmed. The machine hums behind me as it waits for the sliver. The link folds outward, a hungry ring, and the shard so small it might have been a mere pebble threads itself into the payload. The moment the synchronization reads green the machine hiccups and then does what the engineers said it would, it becomes a point that refuses to be part of anything any longer . 

Light collapses inward like a mouth closing. At first it’s all instruments, needles pegged, readouts cratering into nonsense, the HUD fracturing into static that looks, absurdly, like stars. Then physics begins to protest. The air  screams in a register my ears try to hand off to memory. There is a sound I will carry into whatever comes after, less of an explosion than the world folding and sliding into the black. I feel the ship tear, feel seams open along my spine, and then there is no more up or down, only the hunger and the awareness that the thing I have done is final.

In the last clear second, when everything is still a map of sensation and a handful of images, I see my sister’s crooked grin in the photo and the ragged little sparks of the colonists we’d already lost. I think, with a clarity that surprises me, of the scattered handful of human voices that might speak a little longer because a world is being erased. I taste metal and ozone and something like absolution, bitter and necessary.

We live together and have since about 8/9 months in. The first half of the relationship was the definition of a honeymoon phase. We didn't argue once, probably not until about a year and a half in.

I saw a version of him during our first argument that I genuinely believed he could and would never become. He screamed at the top of his lungs, threw my belongings, called me some nasty names, cornered me in the bathroom and physically grabbed me and pushed me when I tried to leave.

He was very apologetic after, bought me flowers, and swore it would never happen again. And it didn't. For 4 months. Because we didn't have our second argument until 4 months later.

Super long story kinda shortened, we've had maybe 4 genuine arguments since then, and every single one has resulted in his screaming at me, and usually calling me a bitch and telling me to STFU.

Usually when he screams he leaves me in the bedroom to cry for a bit and comes back with food or coffee or something. 


I was in a very bad prior relationship. My current bf knows this. I am incredibly sensitive and my one ask is that people just don't fucking yell at me. It mentally brings me back to that time and I break down in tears and feel genuine fear in my body. He also knows this.

With that being said, I'm starting to wonder if I'm just more sensitive than others. Maybe it is common and normal for couples to scream during arguments? Maybe this is just one of those cons that every relationship experiences?",2,1757999303.0,AmItheAsshole,13,0.67,False

Manhattan moves fast: it's a market where attention is currency and impressions convert into long-term relationships. Pop-up shops have become one of the most nimble, measurable, and creative ways brands, from solo makers to established labels, can cut through the noise and plant a memorable presence in New York City’s most valuable retail corridors. In a borough defined by iconic streets, heavy tourist footfall, and a dense local audience with cultured tastes, a well-executed pop-up can do more than sell product for a weekend: it can amplify brand recognition, generate earned media, gather customer insights, and create a sense of urgency and exclusivity that fuels social sharing and repeat engagement. This article walks through the strategic rationale, practical setup, creative approaches, metrics and post-event tactics that turn a temporary retail footprint into a long-term visibility engine for your brand in Manhattan. It also provides a focused paragraph on how Love Studios NYC supports pop-up activations in prime Manhattan sites, and practical, tactical guidance to plan a pop-up that outperforms expectations.

Choosing the right location is the single most important decision for a successful Manhattan pop-up. Whether you target tourist-heavy corridors like Times Square and Hudson Yards, transit nodes such as Penn Station or Port Authority, or niche creative pockets in the Garment District and SoHo, the physical address shapes who will walk in, what press you might attract, and how you position your pricing and inventory. Many brands partner with established venue providers that understand Manhattan microclimates and audience flows — for brands seeking turnkey, flexible solutions, services that list vetted [**pop up locations nyc**](https://lovestudiosnyc.com/service-category/pop-up-shop-rental-space/) make it easier to secure short-term leases and plug into existing foot-traffic patterns. This second-paragraph placement of the venue anchor connects the tactical choice of location directly to broader brand-visibility goals, and emphasizes selection criteria such as proximity to transit, adjacency to complementary retailers, visibility from high-traffic sidewalks, and local event calendars.

# Why Pop-Ups Work in Manhattan

Pop-ups are a hybrid of retail and marketing: temporary, physical, and experience-driven. They allow brands to test the market with limited capital, create shareable moments that translate to organic social reach, and gather first-hand customer feedback that informs product development and marketing messaging. In Manhattan specifically, the density of tourists, commuters, and local trendsetters increases the likelihood that a strong concept will be seen and talked about. Manhattan also amplifies scarcity — when a store exists only for a short window in a high-profile neighborhood, FOMO (fear of missing out) becomes a tool for urgency-driven purchases and social shares.

Strategically, pop-ups are ideal for: introducing new product lines; launching a capsule collection; running seasonal promotions; co-marketing with complementary brands; testing price points or service models; and converting online attention into tactile brand experiences. A pop-up's limited run naturally concentrates promotional efforts, making paid ads, influencer outreach, and local PR more efficient because the message needs to hit hard in a compressed timeframe. Integrated properly with digital channels, a pop-up can boost web traffic, increase email signups, and create measurable spikes in social engagement.

Pop-ups are also a lower-risk option to experiment with location-based strategies: brands can compare results from SoHo versus the Flatiron district, or weekday versus weekend operations, without committing to expensive leases. Those experiments provide data that can inform permanent retail decisions or guide future localized marketing investments. Research shows that many retailers who implement pop-ups consider them strategic successes for driving awareness and market testing.

# Planning the Concept: Experience Before Transaction

A compelling concept is the backbone of any pop-up. In Manhattan's saturated visual environment, shoppers decide in seconds whether to enter. Your storefront, window display, and street-facing narrative must communicate a clear value proposition: what you offer, why it matters, and why shoppers should step inside now. Think of the pop-up as a live-brand statement: lighting, product placement, scent, sound, staff behavior, and packaging all contribute to a single sensory identity. Cohesive theming — whether it’s a seasonal mood, a co-branded activation, or a limited-edition collaboration — makes the experience memorable and shareable.

When planning, map the customer journey from the first glimpse on the sidewalk to the post-purchase follow-up. Prioritize high-impact touchpoints: a striking window vignette, a low-friction checkout flow (card + mobile payment), a friendly staff script that tells the brand story in 30 seconds, and takeaway moments such as branded gift-wrapping or photo-ready moments that encourage social posting. Be deliberate about product assortment: a pop-up should showcase hero products at multiple price points (impulse, core, and premium). Too much inventory can clutter the experience and dilute urgency; too little risks missed sales and frustrated customers. Use pre-event surveys, limited pre-orders, or email segmentation to fine-tune assortment and avoid overstock.

Consider partnerships: local coffee shops, complementary fashion labels, or experience curators can increase footfall and generate co-promotion across different customer bases. For many Manhattan activations, partnering with a venue that already hosts events or markets can provide instant exposure to an engaged audience. Practical checklists and curated tips from experienced retailers and foundations offer a good playbook for small brands preparing their first pop-up.

# Design and Visual Merchandising: Make Every Second Count

In a city where people skim streets like feeds, visual clarity wins. Design your pop-up with a single dominant visual anchor — a large installation, mural, or sculptural display that creates a focal point for photos and social posts. Keep sightlines open and ensure product highlights are at eye level for the majority of passersby. Lighting should flatter product textures and draw attention to key displays; portable track lighting or LED panels can transform an ordinary storefront into a branded stage. Use materials and finishes that photograph well and are consistent with your brand palette, but avoid visual clutter that competes with product.

Create a tactile experience: product testers, limited demos, and interactive displays encourage longer dwell times. A small seating nook or demo counter can change the dynamic from a transaction to an experience. If you plan programming — artist talks, workshops, or demos — designate a visible program area with a clear schedule and signage. Signage must be legible from various distances and optimized for mobile photography (consider how your backdrop looks as a vertical Instagram Story). Branded packaging and receipts are tiny ambassadors — use them to extend the narrative and encourage post-visit sharing.

Accessibility and flow are crucial: anticipate peak times and design queueing that looks purposeful rather than chaotic. Staff should be trained to manage lines, restock quickly, and create moments of delight even for customers waiting to pay.

# Operations, Staffing and Legal Basics

Operational excellence is invisible when it works, but glaring when it fails. Start by securing the right permits: NYC Department of Consumer and Worker Protection and any local permits related to signage or sidewalk usage; temporary sales tax registration may also be required for merchants selling in the state. Your venue partner can often assist or recommend local permit specialists. Short-term liability insurance and event insurance are essential to protect against on-site incidents.

Staffing is part hospitality, part brand education. Hire people who can embody the brand's tone, troubleshoot tech, and convert curiosity into purchase without sounding scripted. Train all staff on key messages, returns and exchanges policy, and emergency procedures. Cross-train a few employees on inventory, point-of-sale, and social media moderation (e.g., reshare customer posts). Inventory management in a pop-up is a delicate balance. Use portable inventory systems, daily sales debriefs, and a reorder protocol for fast-moving SKUs. Consider inventory buffers or online reordering options for out-of-stock items to avoid lost conversions.

Plan for payments, ID verification (if selling age-restricted items), and data capture: a quick email sign-up with a clear value exchange (discount, early access) yields long-term marketing ROI. Protect customer data and follow local regulations for communications and promotions. Build a simple service-level agreement (SLA) with your venue for shared responsibilities: who handles security, cleaning, lost & found, after-hours storage, and emergency procedures.

# Marketing the Pop-Up: Earned, Paid and Owned Channels

A pop-up's visibility depends on a concentrated marketing push. Start with owned channels: communicate the pop-up to your email list with an RSVP or preview; create geo-targeted social ads that hit audiences within walking distance; and craft shareable assets for influencers and partners. Tease the concept with behind-the-scenes content to create anticipation.

Paid amplification works best when hyper-targeted: use local targeting, proximity-based ad units, and countdown creatives that emphasize the limited window. Promote events — tastings, artist talks, or special launches — as discrete media moments that the press and influencers can attend. Earned media requires a strong narrative: why is this pop-up different? Offer exclusive interviews, supply press kits, and schedule press previews during a quiet hour. Invite local tastemakers, neighborhood community pages, and industry-specific writers to experience the store first-hand.

Leverage micro-influencers who live and work in Manhattan; authentic neighborhood recommendations often outperform larger, detached influencer spends. Provide clear creative directions and trackable promo codes to measure conversions. During the activation, maintain a social feed of UGC (user-generated content) and reshare customer stories in real time to amplify reach. Finally, make it easy for customers to keep engaging after they leave: QR codes linked to shop pages, instant discounts for email signups, and a post-visit survey with a small reward increase both retention and the data you need to iterate. Broader industry pieces and practical guides highlight how focused pop-up campaigns can deliver outsized impact for relatively modest budgets.

# Measuring Success: Metrics That Matter

Define success before you open: is this about direct sales, new customer acquisition, press mentions, email list growth, or product-market fit? Good metrics translate into specific, trackable actions during the event. A sensible dashboard might include: footfall (people who entered), conversion rate (transactions per visitor), average order value, email signups, social mentions and impressions, cost per acquisition (CPA), and post-event lifetime value of customers acquired.

Use simple technology to capture these metrics: POS systems with analytics, footfall counters, and UTM-tagged links for any campaign that drives online traffic. Track social metrics with a branded hashtag and listening tools to capture sentiment and top-performing content. Consider a two-step success metric: immediate activation KPIs (sales, traffic, signups) and downstream KPIs (repeat purchases, churn, campaign-driven revenue) measured at 30, 60, and 90 days post-event. This helps you attribute the long-term value of a short-lived activation and informs decisions about repeat pop-ups or permanent retail investments.

Quantitative metrics should be complemented by qualitative feedback: staff notes, direct customer quotes, and on-site observational research to understand barriers and opportunities. This qualitative layer often reveals the smallest changes that produce the biggest performance lifts.

# Real-World Examples and Creative Formats

Pop-ups come in many shapes: single-brand takeovers, collaborative marketplaces, sample-and-sell showcases, and experience-first activations (think interactive installations or workshops). Manhattan has seen a steady stream of successful formats: online-first brands launching brick experiences; luxury labels creating curated 'pop-up boutiques' during fashion week; and community-driven markets that aggregate complementary makers into a single customer magnet.

A successful example is when a DTC (direct-to-consumer) brand uses a pop-up to create a localized community and a PR moment — they invite local creators, host a panel, and turn their product demo into a teachable moment. These events often yield press mentions and influencer content that extends the activation’s reach far beyond the physical days open. Collaborations can be particularly catalytic: pairing a food artisan with a lifestyle brand, or combining a tech demo with a hands-on workshop, broadens appeal and cross-pollinates audiences. Third-place activations — in cafes, galleries, or transit-adjacent lobbies — tap into existing social routines and can be as effective as headline storefronts for building loyal followings.

Micro-pop-ups that rotate neighborhoods during a month-long campaign can test multiple Manhattan submarkets quickly, allowing brands to learn which demographics and street-level environments generate the best ROI. These nimble formats often cost a fraction of a long-term lease but yield proportional insights and media coverage if executed with a coherent creative strategy.

# Neighborhood Micro-Analysis: Choosing the Right Manhattan Pocket

When choosing a Manhattan neighborhood, break the borough into micro-markets and prioritize them based on your target customer profile, price elasticity, and brand fit. Below are common Manhattan micro-markets and the strategic advantages each offers:

* **Tourist Corridors (Times Square, Rockefeller Center):** Massive footfall and visibility. Ideal for mainstream, impulse-driven products and brand awareness stunts. Expect higher rent and a diverse but shallow-convert audience.
* **Transit Hubs (Penn Station, Port Authority):** High-volume commuter flow; great for quick buys and convenience-driven categories (grab-and-go, travel accessories). Messaging should be immediate and frictionless.
* **Fashion & Creative Districts (Garment District, SoHo, Chelsea):** More curated, fashion-aware crowds that appreciate design story and exclusivity. These neighborhoods are excellent for collaborations, editorial press, and influencer gatherings.
* **Business Districts (Flatiron, Midtown East):** Weekday traffic from professionals — plan lunchtime activations or showrooms that cater to higher AOV (average order value) and corporate purchases.
* **Brooklyn-adjacent Manhattan (DUMBO-adjacent areas, Lower East Side edge):** For brands with artisanal or niche audiences; these areas reward authenticity and community-building programs.

Map your ideal day-in-the-life of your customer: where do they commute, what cafes or gyms do they frequent, and what neighborhoods align with their lifestyle? A neighborhood that's perfect for one brand's product might be a mismatch for another's — the key is alignment between product, price, and the neighborhood personality.

# An 8-Week Timeline to Launch Your Pop-Up

**Week 8: Concept and Location Scouting** — Finalize concept, identify 3–5 neighborhoods, and shortlist venues. Begin conversations with venue partners and collect quotes for build-out.

**Week 7: Budget and Team** — Create a detailed budget with vendor quotes, confirm staffing needs, and assign an event manager who will own logistics.

**Week 6: Permits and Legal** — Research necessary permits and begin applications; book temporary insurance and confirm sales tax registration procedures.

**Week 5: Creative Production** — Lock in design, signage, and packaging. Order fixtures, point-of-sale hardware, and printed collateral. Begin outreach to local press and influencers.

**Week 4: Inventory and Operations** — Finalize SKU mix, set up inventory systems, and run staff training scripts. Arrange shipping and storage logistics with the venue or a nearby storage partner.

**Week 3: Marketing Ramp-Up** — Launch event pages, open RSVP windows for VIP previews, schedule paid social campaigns, and distribute press materials. Confirm experiential elements and timing.

**Week 2: Final Checks** — Conduct test runs of POS, signage placement, and lighting. Confirm cleaning and security plans, and finalize staffing rosters with contingency backups. Prepare an opening-day checklist and a press preview schedule.

**Week 1: Soft Open & Feedback Loop** — Host a soft opening for team, partners, and selected customers to gather early feedback and make last-minute adjustments. Ensure daily debriefs are scheduled for the first week of public operation.

Building in these staged milestones prevents last-minute mistakes and ensures that marketing, operations, and creative teams are synchronized. The timeline can compress for flash activations, but compressing increases the risk of operational hiccups.

# Sample Budget Allocation (Narrative)

Below is a narrative example of how an independent brand might allocate a $25,000 pop-up budget for a two-week Manhattan activation. Adjust figures for your brand scale and goals.

* **Venue & Rent (40% / $10,000):** Prime Manhattan windows are expensive; negotiate for weekday-only rates or revenue-share models if possible.
* **Build-out & Visuals (20% / $5,000):** Modular fixtures, rentals, a signature installation, and signage that photographs well.
* **Staffing & Training (10% / $2,500):** Wages for part-time staff, shift leads, and manager coverage.
* **Marketing & PR (15% / $3,750):** Paid local ads, influencer collaboration stipends, press kits, and launch event costs.
* **Inventory Buffer (10% / $2,500):** Safety stock for best-sellers and quick replenishment funds.
* **Permits, Insurance & Contingency (5% / $1,250):** Short-term liability insurance, permit fees, and a small contingency line.

This allocation emphasizes visibility and the experience because those elements are the primary drivers of brand lift. If direct sales are the core objective, consider shifting more budget into inventory and point-of-sale reliability.

# Staff Script and Customer Journey (Example)

**Greeting (0–5 seconds):** ""Hi — welcome! We’re \[brand\]. Today we’re showcasing our \[hero product\]. Can I show you the limited run we made for this pop-up?"" Simple, polite and direct.

**Engage (5–30 seconds):** Use a short brand story: ""We make small-batch \[product\] in NYC using \[unique attribute\]. If you have 30 seconds, I’ll show you what makes this different.""

**Assist (30–90 seconds):** Offer a tactile demo: ""This fabric breathes; it’s treated with X; it’s made to last."" Suggest complementary items and a limited-time bundle.

**Convert (final step):** Close with a clear call-to-action: ""We also have 10% off for attendees who sign up today — can I ring you up?"" For browsers, offer an email sign-up and a postcard with a unique discount code for later conversion.

Staff should also be trained to observe customer cues and upsell gently; the best staffers feel like local ambassadors rather than salespeople.

# Influencer & Community Outreach Template

**Subject:** Exclusive Preview — \[Brand\] Pop-Up in Manhattan

Hi \[Name\],

We're launching a two-week pop-up at \[neighborhood\] to showcase our new \[product/collection\]. We'd love to invite you to an exclusive preview on \[date/time\]. You’ll have first access to limited pieces, a small gift, and a chance to meet the founders. If you’re available, we’d be thrilled to host you and coordinate a short feature or Insta Story.

Looking forward to hearing from you,  
\[Your Name\]  
\[Brand\]

This short, respectful outreach highlights exclusivity, clear value for the influencer (early access + gift), and a simple call to action — all of which increase acceptance rates among local creators.

# Troubleshooting Common Problems

* **Low foot traffic:** Re-route marketing to hyper-local ads, partner with a neighboring business for cross-promotion, or host a surprise mini-event to grab attention.
* **Staffing issues:** Keep an on-call pool, cross-train employees, and incentivize referrals to maintain coverage during rushes.
* **Inventory shortages:** Implement a live 'order-and-ship' option at POS so customers can buy out-of-stock items online for shipment within 48–72 hours.
* **Permitting delays:** Work with a local events consultant who understands NYC permit timelines and can expedite filings.

Operational problems are normal; quick, transparent communication and a problem-resolution playbook keep customer trust intact.

# Scaling: From One Pop-Up to a Physical Footprint

Treat each pop-up as a controlled experiment: if a neighborhood consistently outperforms on conversion and LTV, consider a longer-term lease or a recurring residency. Use revenue-share or flexible short-term leases as intermediate steps. Over time, refine assortment, staffing, and marketing to lower CAC and improve repeat purchase rates. Scaling should be incremental and data-driven — double down where metrics and qualitative feedback align.

# Case Study: A Fictional DTC Brand's Two-Week Manhattan Pop-Up (Illustrative)

**Brand:** Harbor & Thread — a direct-to-consumer lifestyle brand known for mid-priced, craft-forward home goods.

**Objective:** Build brand awareness in Manhattan, capture 1,500 email signups, and test a new woven collection.

**Location:** A two-week pop-up in a high-visibility Flatiron storefront with evening programming and weekend maker markets.

**Execution highlights:** Harbor & Thread invested in a striking installation — a suspended textile sculpture that acted as a photo backdrop — and partnered with a local coffee roaster for weekend cross-promotion. They used a simple RSVP for a soft preview that generated 350 attendees and seeded early social content. Inventory was set with three price tiers (access, core, and premium) and a limited 'pop-up only' colorway to drive urgency.

**Results (illustrative):** 2,200 in-store visitors; 1,800 transactions; 2,100 email signups (exceeded target); paid media ROI of 3x; sustained website traffic uplift of 42% four weeks post-event; and multiple press mentions in local lifestyle outlets. Harbor & Thread used the data to open a small permanent showroom three months later in a nearby neighborhood where conversion and post-visit LTV were highest.

This fictional example demonstrates how tight creative focus, community partnerships, and a layered marketing strategy convert temporary visibility into lasting brand momentum.

# Quick Checklist and Common Questions

**Checklist:** permits in place; venue contract signed; insurance confirmed; staffing roster and training complete; POS and inventory systems tested; marketing campaign scheduled; opening day walkthrough completed; signage and photography plan approved; emergency contacts shared.

**FAQ:** How long should a pop-up run? Short windows (1–2 days) create urgency; week-long runs allow for deeper testing; month-long trials yield better market signals but raise costs. What time of year is best? Holiday seasons and fashion week have high footfall but also higher competition and costs. Can online brands succeed? Absolutely — many e-commerce brands use pop-ups to build community and trust, especially when products benefit from touch-and-feel.

How do I measure brand lift? Combine short-term metrics (footfall, signups, sales) with downstream metrics (repeat purchase rate, LTV). Use unique promo codes and UTM links for attribution.

# Budgeting: Where to Spend and Where to Save

A well-planned budget differentiates a strategic pop-up from an expensive experiment. Major cost buckets include: location rent and venue fees; build-out and décor; staffing and training; inventory; marketing and PR; permits and insurance; and operational overhead (utilities, waste management).

Allocate budget to high-impact, visible elements: façade/graphics, a striking centerpiece, and a reliable point-of-sale system. Save on costs through modular fixtures, rentals, and venue partners who provide turnkey support. Consider revenue offsets such as ticketed launch events, private shopping experiences, and collaborations where partners share costs. Negotiate short-term lease flexibility: weekday-only activations often cost less than full-weekend blocks, but weigh footfall tradeoffs carefully. Also, explore shared pop-up spaces or marketplaces to split rent with complementary brands. Keep a contingency of at least 10% for unexpected operational costs.

# Post-Event Follow-Up and Conversion Strategy

The days after a pop-up are critical for converting ephemeral interest into sustainable relationships. Send a thank-you message to everyone who signed up at the event with a limited-time offer, and publish a highlight reel on social channels and email newsletters. Measure and act on the data you collected: retarget attendees with personalized ads, segment email lists by behavior (purchasers, browsers, event-only attendees), and invite top fans to future events or loyalty programs. Analyze what stock sold and what didn’t, and either reprice or repurpose leftovers — consider online-exclusive bundles or post-popup flash sales.

Document everything: staff feedback, vendor performance, and a clear post-mortem with learnings and actionable next steps. These insights are the true ROI of a pop-up because they lower the cost and risk of future physical investments.

# Final Notes: Practical Reminders

1. Define what brand visibility means for you — is it social reach, press coverage, foot traffic, or revenue — then choose metrics that align.
2. The right venue partner reduces operational friction. If you need fast setup and local know-how, work with a venue that lists vetted **pop up locations nyc** and understands Manhattan footfall patterns.
3. Treat the pop-up as a product itself: prototype, measure, iterate.

Pop-ups in Manhattan reward creativity and operational discipline equally. With careful planning, a focus on customer experience, and smart post-event follow-up, a temporary space can deliver outsized brand visibility that reverberates far beyond the days it's open.

# Next Steps: From Idea to Opening Day

Start with a one-page brief that states your objective, target customer, preferred neighborhoods, and budget. Use that brief to solicit quotes from three venues and two build-out partners. Schedule a call with your marketing lead to map an 8-week timeline and decide on key promotional partners. Run a modest pre-launch campaign to measure local interest before committing to dates. Finally, commit to a post-event 30/60/90-day analysis to capture true ROI. Small, deliberate steps lower risk and increase the chance your pop-up becomes a measurable success for brand visibility.

We live together and have since about 8/9 months in. The first half of the relationship was the definition of a honeymoon phase. We didn't argue once, probably not until about a year and a half in.

I saw a version of him during our first argument that I genuinely believed he could and would never become. He screamed at the top of his lungs, threw my belongings, called me some nasty names, cornered me in the bathroom and physically grabbed me and pushed me when I tried to leave.

He was very apologetic after, bought me flowers, and swore it would never happen again. And it didn't. For 4 months. Because we didn't have our second argument until 4 months later.

Super long story kinda shortened, we've had maybe 4 genuine arguments since then, and every single one has resulted in his screaming at me, and usually calling me a bitch and telling me to STFU.

Usually when he screams he leaves me in the bedroom to cry for a bit and comes back with food or coffee or something. 

I was in a very abusive relationship that I only got out of because he was charged with assaulting me with a gun and deported out of the country. My current bf knows this. I am incredibly sensitive and my one ask is that people just don't fucking yell at me. It mentally brings me back to that time and I break down in tears and feel genuine fear in my body. He also knows this

With that being said, I'm starting to wonder if I'm just more sensitive than others. Maybe it is common and normal for couples to scream during arguments? Maybe this is just one of those cons that every relationship experiences?

I’m hoping to connect with a like-minded lady who’s up for a chat. I'm open to all kinds of conversations—whether you just want someone to listen, enjoy a platonic exchange, or you're feeling a little adventurous, I’m here for it.

About me: I’m known to be fun, especially if you’re the calm and fun type too. I’m well-educated, soft-spoken, and generally considered a nice guy. Not tall, but fit—I run a lot. I’d say I’m fairly good-looking and happy to share a photo. I enjoy reading, watching YouTube, and being outdoors—hiking and weekend walks are my thing. I'm also a huge fan of coffee, chips, chocolate, and ice cream. I don’t drink or smoke, and I prefer one-on-one chats over group settings or parties.

All ages, races, locations, time zones, and relationship statuses are welcome to message me. I just ask that you’re respectful and genuinely want to chat.

(Finished at last!)

\---

I’d like to think that Bryce tries to disguise herself with a hat and sunglasses but is too much in the habit of walking around tits out to remember to cover up the star on her chest.

\---

It seems more inconvenient than sexy for an accidental wing touch to be akin to having your balls groped.

\---

The Hunt-Bryce personality swap is getting me.  
Hunt: “Let people have *fun*, Bryce. It’s a *party*.”  
Bryce, former party girl: “But there’s *evil* in the world, Hunt!”  
Like girl, you’ve been glossing over the evil for so long. Just chill and have a few drinks.

\---

A few pages ago, we were comparing wings to balls, and now Hunt is casually stroking Bryce with them. So, are they sensitive or not? Is he getting off on this? Is this the angel equivalent of grinding?

\---

Given that Fae males basically get it up again in seconds, I don’t understand the issue with premature ejaculation.

>!(Hi Cassian)!<

\---

Add “permanently removing content from the Internet” to Fury’s list of bullshit superpowers.

\---

“That sword’s as much yours as it is mine.” -Ruhn  
“I’ll take it on weekends and holidays, don’t worry.” -Bryce  
“And it’ll get *two* Winter Solstices, so… double the presents.” -Hunt  
Bryce-Hunt Banter is like the highlight of Crescent City.

\---

I hope Ruhn wasn’t drinking from that whiskey bottle Bryce just took. I *know* whose goods that tongue’s been sampling.

Wait no don’t pass the bottle to Juniper!  
They should play *real* Russian Roulette instead. It would stress me out less.

\---

“…had made him keep his hands to himself and his cock in his pants. Fins. Whatever.”  
The wording here makes it sound more like Tharion has fins for a cock. It’s canon now.

\---

Curious that the River Queen is looking for the thunderbirds. Sounds a bit dangerous, for her particularly wet situation.

\---

I’m glad at least Bryce has her priorities straight. Ithan’s bloody body does *not* need to go on the fancy white couch. He’s already uncomfortable. The coffee table isn’t going to make or break his experience.

\---

“Hunt fixed a cup of decaf just to give himself something to do as Ithan lay bleeding on the coffee table behind him.”  
What a string of words.  
Also, dude, if Ithan’s on the coffee table, *where are you going to rest your coffee*? Don’t say the couch.

\---

“It was fine. Totally fucking fine that Ithan Holstrom was sharing Bryce’s bed.”  
I’m literally cackling.  
Ithan: “I’ll take the couch.”  
Bryce: “Like Hel you will!”  
Hunt: “*I’ll* take the couch.”  
Bryce: “No one will take the couch.”  
Hunt: “Fine, *you* take the couch, and he’ll take *your* bed.”  
Bryce: “NO ONE TAKES THE COUCH.”  
And then Bryce ends up in bed with Ithan somehow.

\---

“Holstrom was good-looking, when he wasn’t beaten to Hel and back… Hunt remembered watching a few of the games in the 33rd’s lounge in the Comitium, marveling at Holstrom’s speed and agility. The male hadn’t played the sport for two years now, but he was still built.”  
I think you’re a bit jealous of *both* of them, buddy.  
In the good olde days of fanfiction, this lone paragraph would have *launched ships*. Whatever happened to the Old Guard? The Rituals? The Ways?

\---

Cormac probably thinks he’s joking about Ruhn x Bryce, but *he* doesn’t know about the fawn whiskey deception.  
I bet Cormac has the most poppin’ AO3 profile. He’s the backbone of at least *three* niche fandom economies and the scourge of the mainstream. He thought Game of Thrones was a romantic comedy.

\---

“The Oracle of Avallen said I was destined to unite with a princess who possessed a star in her heart. That our mingling would bring great prosperity to our people.” -Cormac  
I mean, there are plenty of ways to “unite” that aren’t marriage or sex.  
But unfortunately, his illegal and immoral for-profit fanfiction side hustle has biased him.

\---

Cormac gives strong “I close my eyes and think of England” energy.

\---

Hunt is such a child, but I’ll let him have this one. *Someone’s* gotta tackle Motherfucker Number One (read: Pollux), and Isaiah and Naomi lack the balls and brain damage.

\---

Danika Fendyr’s very soul has been erased, and yet she’s *still* haunting the narrative. Iconic.

\---

Personally, I think that every human who has to live in a world full of immortal pricks should be rationed *at least* one mech suit.

\---

“The mer was as attractive as she remembered. Perhaps more so, now that he was slightly disheveled and muddy.”  
Have I mentioned lately how much I like Bryce?  
“This fish is suffering.” \* licks lips \*

\---

Hunt is bringing that “We fought the Asteri and lost, so no one else should try ever again” energy to the party. He should get that printed on a shirt.

\---

Tharion: “Here are copies of the emails.”  
Also Tharion: “Don’t put anything in writing.”  
Like a sentence apart, even.

\---

Very kind of the Prince of the Chasm to appear as a *white* cat so that if (when) he gets fur on the white couch, it won’t ruin the aesthetic.

But how dare he call Reluctant Hero Bryce cliche (accurate) while failing to acknowledge that magical-cat-telling-a-girl-her-fate is *also* cliche. It’s like he hasn’t seen Sabrina. Or Sailor Moon. Or Madoka Magika. Someone please buy this cat a Crunchyroll subscription.

\---

Bryce: “I wish I had time to process this bomb that just dropped, but unfortunately my 9-to-5 calls.” \*assumes work persona\*

\---

“Can we go back to how the Prince of the Chasm was *sitting on my lap*?” -Ithan  
Actually yes, let’s. That's the one part of the scene that I will remember fondly. Perhaps hornily, I don’t know. I’m still waiting for Cormac to upload the fic.

\---

Ithan, sighing: “I wasn’t expecting to wake up and find myself a traitor to my country.” \*cranks up TV\*

\---

“All it would take was one peek down the alley into the dusty shadows, *one* photograph, and this whole thing — Hunt halted.”  
Hunt is cockblocking Hunt for intelligent reasons this time! Character growth!

\---

Now that I'm finally done, I can share my (unrefined and largely unedited) first reactions notes.  
Fair warning, my real notes are way more critical than my Reddit notes and have ToG/ACOTAR spoilers mixed in:

I supposed how it happened -

Short version: 

Met a guy on Hinge - we spoke for a few weeks, all seemed good - we’d face time regularly and the vibe seemed consistent.

We decided it would be great to meet in person - so we pitched the idea of staying at his place, then I believe the “what if it doesn’t work” dawned on both of us. So I suggested to book a hotel for two nights, just in case , then he’d plan some weekend activities for us since I’m visiting his country and I’d spend the rest of the stay at his place. Thankfully money was never an issue. 

We met and after 5 mins in I could tell our vibe and chemistry was completely different in person. We had some food and within 20 mins we’re walking back to my hotel. We hugged like strangers, I suppose. I went back to my hotel, thinking wtf just happened? 

About an hour after he sends me a weird message “I hope I didn’t scare you off” so I said, absolutely not, why would you? He didn’t reply. He eventually replied with “I bet you have some great plans and hope you get out to see the city”..This is coming from the guy who is the sole reason I’m in the country. 

Anyways, I didn’t waste the opportunity, jump back on the apps, started talking and arranged to meet guys for hook ups and just a drink, coffee or chat etc. One guy ended up being something I wanted and more, it’ll be his 3rd time visiting me in November and I’ll be spending Christmas with his family. 😆

Did I feel down in the hotel room? I felt like crap, but after an hour of realize I’m staying in a trendy neighbour - I walked out, enjoyed the scenery, smiled with strangers and had a great hook up to numb the feeling and get over the situation. ",5,1757997857.0,askgaybros,4,1.0,False

I like to use mainly medium roasted coffee and I know that other methods like french press are specially good for this profile but I would like to keep using pour over methods with paper filters.

1ni86r6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Leavesandink/comments/1ni86r6/cracked/,Cracked,"My mother always had a gorgeous smile. She used to be an actual beauty queen and every aspect of her appearance was perfectly put together but her smile was always the first thing people would mention. So the first time I saw her teeth outside of her mouth I was shocked, but only for a moment. In the days that followed it made perfect sense that her teeth were fake, just like the kind words she offered strangers right before gossiping behind their backs or the 'natural youthfulness' that definitely didn't come from more than a smidgen of botox.

It wasn't until my early teens when I used this information against her though. We were supposed to be visiting my grandparents and even though there was still a full hour before we'd need to leave, when she saw me sat in my pyjamas finishing one more race on Mario Kart she went haywire.

""You aren't ready!"" she yelled but I foolishly believed this could be a negotiation.

""Oh, just five more minutes.""

""You have to get showered, you aren't dressed, you don't have your makeup on, you haven't brushed your teeth-""

That was when I said it. It was childish, sure but I didn't even want to see my grandparents. My grandpa never seemed to show anyone the slightest affection and my grandma was a portal into my mother's future and offered me identical verbal jabs, unsolicited criticisms and soulless smiles.

""At least I have teeth..."" I muttered.

My mother's expression changed from anger into a deeper rage. I was sure she was going to hit me or worse but instead she simply shook her head.

""Some day you'll see."" she replied and closed the door.

That was that then. My parents saw my grandparents without me and I decided that I was going to have perfect teeth no matter what. As a teenager this meant whitening strips and a sudden refusal to ever touch coffee again. As an adult it changed to buying braces the second I could afford them and I flashed my shiny, natural smile at my mother every step along the way. Maybe genetics had made her believe that I was destined for teeth that would rot away but I'd overcome that. I'd been more consciencious in how I treated my teeth. I was *better*.

You'll understand the tragedy then, when I ran my tongue over my incisors three days ago and there was a chip in the front left tooth. I raced to the mirror and there it was, a tiny dent on the edge and a hairline crack above it. I combed my brain to figure out how this had happened but I found nothing. I'm not exagerrating when I say I didn't eat anything solid that day. Two soups and a smoothie. My stomach growled but I was nervous to risk eve bread -- what if I bit it wrong and chipped another tooth?

A new day, a new chip on a new tooth. This time both of my front upper incisors were showing similar cracls. It was only then that the idea I might be griding my teeth came to me and I bought a mouthguard after work. I shoved it in with a discomfort more intense than anything my time in braces had given me. It took me longer than usual to fall asleep but eventually I drifted away.

I felt it before I was awake, the tugging sensation inside my propped open mouth. Then my upper mouthguard began to loosen and I jolted awake, screaming with a force that threw something small out of my mouth and onto my blanket.

The thing didn't look like a fairy but it had wings. It had wings and once it had taken a second to shake off its disorientation it fucking *hissed* at me and just flew away. It left my room through the door and I didn't think to follow it and see how it had gotten in. Hell, it took me a second to even recover enough to reach up and remove the object that was propping my jaws open from inside my mouth. It was a cross between a pickaxe and a hammer and so small.

I've texted my mother five times since then with no reply but I know that she knows what's happening to me, just like I know that it happened to her mother before her. I don't know what started it, or how many of my family members were given the same fate but the tooth fairy isn't done with us once we reach adulthood.

My wife and I are visiting CDMX and staying at the Hilton Reforma from 9/17–9/22. We’re in our mid-thirties and plan to explore many of the city’s main attractions. We’d love any suggestions to help fine-tune our itinerary, or recommendations for the areas we’ll be visiting. I have Diamond status with Hilton, so we’ll likely take advantage of the hotel’s free breakfast each day—but please feel free to suggest any awesome coffee or pastry shops we should try in the mornings.

**Wednesday, Sept 17**

* **Evening** – We land at 17:50 and will likely get to the hotel around 19:30. Plan is to grab a late-night bite at La Casa de Toño—but are there better food options within walking distance?

**Thursday, Sept 18**

* **Morning** – Chapultepec Castle + Anthropology Museum
* **Early Afternoon** – Walk to Condesa, grab a late lunch, and check out Parque México and nearby boutiques
* **Evening** – Continue exploring Condesa before dinner/drinks

**Friday, Sept 19**

* **Morning** – Coffee at Finca Don Porfirio (for the Bellas Artes view), then visit the Bank Museum and/or the Post Office Museum
* **Early Afternoon** – Stop at Tacos de Canasta Los Especiales on the way to the Zócalo area; explore Constitution Plaza/Zócalo/etc. Then walk back toward the hotel, stopping at Mercado San Juan and (hopefully) El Moro Churros
* **Evening** – Any recommendations for dinner/drinks near Hilton Reforma?

**Saturday, Sept 20**

* **Morning** – Start at Bazaar Sábado in San Ángel
* **Noon** – Head to Coyoacán Market for shopping and lunch, then visit the Frida Kahlo Museum (reservation at 2:15 pm)
* **Evening** – Explore Roma or return to Condesa for dinner/drinks. Any great spots that don’t require reservations?

**Sunday, Sept 21**

* **Morning/Afternoon** – Nothing firmly planned. Thinking of cycling back to anything we may have missed, or staying around Paseo de la Reforma since it’s closed to cars on Sundays.

Im M21

Ive always wanted to start something and turn it into success. Ive had this constant drive ever since when I was 15 and attempted eBay dropshipping lol (of course it failed).

But I have always chased education around entrepreneurship and ideas, started a few things but quit them.

I’m really keen to connect with other like-minded people who are interested in startups and building something from the ground up. At the moment I’m working on a couple ideas, but I know from experience that the right co-founder(s) can make all the difference in actually bringing a project to life as I have always been a solopreneur which is exhausting.

I’d love to meet people who:
	•	Are passionate about entrepreneurship, tech, or creative industries
	•	Have skills in areas like design, coding, marketing, operations, or finance (but enthusiasm and drive are just as important)
	•	Want to bounce around ideas and maybe test the waters on building something together

I’m open to coffee chats, casual meetups, or just starting with a chat online to see if there’s alignment. Even if we don’t co-found something straight away, I think Newcastle needs more people connecting around innovation and startups.

If this sounds like you, drop a comment or send me a DM.",1,1757997529.0,newcastle,21,0.53,False
1ni82xb,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1ni82xb/how_to_select_a_hot_chocolate_maker_for_frequent/,How to select a hot chocolate maker for frequent use?,"Hey everyone! I've been on a quest to find the perfect hot chocolate maker for my daily cocoa fix, and I thought I'd share my experience and insights with fellow chocolate lovers.

After trying various methods and machines over the years, I've learned that choosing the right hot chocolate maker can make a huge difference in taste and convenience. Trust me, once you've had properly made hot chocolate, there's no going back to those instant packets!

First, let's talk about what makes a great hot chocolate maker. The key features you want to look for are:

- Temperature control (crucial for preventing burnt chocolate)
- Mixing capability (for smooth, clump-free results)
- Capacity (depending on how many cups you want to make)
- Easy cleaning (because nobody wants dried chocolate stuck everywhere)

I recently discovered this amazing hot chocolate maker (https://athometouch.com/hot-chocolate-maker) that checks all these boxes. It's become my go-to recommendation for friends and family.

Some important factors to consider when choosing your machine:

1. Material Quality
Stainless steel is your best bet. It's durable, easy to clean, and won't affect the taste of your drink.

2. Heating Method
Look for machines with even heat distribution. Some cheaper models have hot spots that can burn your chocolate.

3. Frothing Capability
A good frother makes your hot chocolate creamy and luxurious. It's worth paying extra for this feature.

4. Versatility
Many modern hot chocolate makers can also handle milk frothing for coffee drinks, which is a nice bonus.

I've found that investing in a quality machine saves money in the long run. You'll use better chocolate, waste less, and enjoy better results. Check out this particular model (https://athometouch.com/hot-chocolate-maker) - it's been a game-changer for my morning routine.

Pro Tips:
- Always start with room temperature milk
- Use real chocolate instead of powder when possible
- Clean your machine immediately after use
- Experiment with different chocolate percentages
- Don't overfill - leave room for frothing

Remember, the best hot chocolate maker for you depends on your specific needs. Consider how often you'll use it, how many people you're serving, and your counter space.

I hope this helps you make an informed decision! Feel free to ask any questions - I'm always happy to chat about hot chocolate!

1ni82uv,https://www.reddit.com/r/oscarrace/comments/1ni82uv/i_saw_41_films_at_tiff_this_year_here_are_my/,"I Saw 41 Films at TIFF this Year, Here are My Thoughts on Them All","So, TIFF 50 has come and gone, and I figured I'd pop by with my thoughts on the 40 films I saw during the fest, and the 1 I saw in a test screening. I apologize in advance, but you're in for a long one. If you have any questions about the films, or just wanna give me shit for (dis)liking a film or comparing too much to the source material, send a comment below and I'll get back to it in the morning. I apologize if it's stream of consciousness at points. Lot to watch, little time.

But here is, in alphabetical order, my thoughts on 41 of the official selections of TIFF 50.

**& Sons**

& Sons the book was a 400+ page, sprawling jumble of a book, with 80 bajillion plot points, hyper crazy twists and half of an in-universe book contained inside it. It was messy, it was bizarre, it was undeniably New York, and all the same, I had a fun time reading it. & Sons the movie, in contrast, cuts away the fat, the fluff and the funky, and even the flats of New York, rerouting the story to the English country side. The end result is a much more streamlined film, with an undeniably great Bill Nighy performance at its core, but also a rather dull and sleepy affair. It's inoffensive and decently well crafted, but also highly unmemorable and stuffy. If & Sons the book thought itself a contemporary American classic in the vein of Gatsby and Catcher, & Sons the film sets its sights firmly at ""2pm Sunday Matinee"" and achieves it.

**Arco**

Arco, on its own merits, is not a bad film. It's well animated with a thoughtful message and a fun twist on Peter Pan, evocative of how Miyazaki converted Little Mermaid into Ponyo. However, for reasons unknown to me, TIFF decided to screen the dub instead of the original audio (as promised on the ticket) and the dub is let's say, more 4Kids, less GKids. While star studded like Ghibli's dubs, the direction here is rough, leaving the A-List stars to come across as phoning in their lines. There is no guessing who the voices are behind the characters, let's put it that way. Couple this with some stilted dialogue and it held back what could've been a great film. I will check out the French original in due time, but this was a disappointing first impression.

**Bad Apples**

Bad Apples is the type of film I love to discover at the fest. What, on the surface, may sound generic or slight is, in execution, one of the funniest (and most intelligent) films I've seen all year. Saoirse Ronan brings 110% to her role in this, playing a loveable but exhausted teacher who goes to crazy lengths to ensure her students succeed. The core themes are timely, intelligent and spurred significant thought. Is it best to root out the bad apples in our lives? How do we balance communal good with individual success? These are nuanced questions the film addresses with tact and a dark, often cruel, sense of wit. A highlight of the fest.

**Ballad of a Small Player**

Ballad of a Small Player started out as a flawed, but interesting, book about a heavy duty gambler in Macau and the price of success. Ballad, the movie, takes this concept, strips it of its nuance, counteracts the very message of the story it is trying to tell, and drops it back on screens for everyone to ""enjoy"". Worst of all - it's very dull. A good Colin Farrell performance, strong visuals and an incredible soundtrack try their damndest to keep this film afloat, but the lackluster script and poor pacing leave this Ballad one better left unsung. A mega disappointment from a director I greatly admire.

**Blue Moon**

Blue Moon, to me, is an example of why Linklater is such a strong filmmaker. Like in Tape, he proves that one room, Ethan Hawke and a great script is all he needs to deliver a gripping film. Throw in some Broadway history deep cuts, a brilliantly realized Sardi's, and a stunning ensemble, and what you're left with is a treat for fans of the stage and screen alike. Ethan Hawke's performance in this is the very best I saw at the fest and Robert Kaplow's spectacular script could easily make the jump to stage and win Tony's.

**Charlie Harper**

Charlie Harper has good intentions. It's a decade spanning romance with two strong performances at its core. It's a tale of young love, love lost and love, perhaps, regained. All the same, it is a classic example of a debut feature biting off way more than it can chew with tangled plotlines giving way to audience fatigue and befuddlement.

**The Choral**

If & Sons was the 2pm matinee, The Choral is the 2pm Matinee deluxe. The one you take your grandparents to with low expectations and end up spending two hours in the coffee shop sharing memories about. This is a kindhearted, funny and witty dramedy about WWI England that combines historical nuance with surprising levity. I have to admit, I find the reviews of this one rather surprising. At worst this is harmless and at best, it serves as a reminder why Hytner and Bennett make such a good pair.

**The Christophers**

Like Blue Moon, The Christophers is another chamber piece from an acclaimed director. And like Blue Moon, it's awesome. A battle of wits between a brilliant Michaela Cole and a cracking Ian McKellen, The Christophers combines British comedy with insight on the nature of working as an artist today, all while being shot to look like a painting come to life. This movie is not for everyone, I saw folks walk out, nod off, and I get it. But it really connected with me, and ranks among the upper echelon of Soderbergh's filmography (and I should know, I've seen them all).

**Couture**

Alice Winocour is a festival favourite of mine, always impressing me with her skillful eye and thoughtful direction. So needless to say, expectations were high going in to Couture. They were met for the brilliant first act, but unfortunately as the film progresses, it begins to lose sight of its many characters, getting caught up in the chaos. All the same, this is a well directed film with good performances from all.

**Dead Lover**

The only film I've ever seen presented in ""Stink O Vision"", Dead Lover is a bonkers film I'm shocked Telefilm funded. It's funny and gross, but still rather tame by outsider art levels. All the same, this was a fun watch, and an unforgettable experience (my nostrils are still burning from Smell 12... blegh)

**EPIC: Elvis Presley in Concert**

What does a Baz Luhrmann documentary look like? Honestly, it's probably best described as video art, the type you would see in a museum or at the Sphere. Is Baz Luhrmann a good video artist? Good is underselling it. This was a spectacular time.

**The Fence**

Claire Denis' adaptation of Black Battles With Dogs is reduced in scope, making for a bit of a snooze. All the same, it's beautiful to look at and the cast is uniformly great.

**Frankenstein**

GDT's version of the undead brute is much closer to Shelley's in that, well, he's not a brute. Jacob Elordi brilliantly brings the creature to life, bringing a Doug Jones like approach to the monster's ""infancy"", before taking on an almost Bale-like candor in the latter half. His performance is anchored by GDT's skillful eye and some of the best technicals you'll see this year, but the script itself makes some unneeded changes to the story (and particularly Elizabeth's character) that don't sit right with me, and the rest of the cast, while solid, fall well within the shadow of Elordi's cloak.

**Glenrothan**

I am surprised at the pans for Brian Cox's whisky drama. At the end of the day, this is the Johnnie Black of movies. Some elements are blended in better than others (HBO acting meets Hallmark Channel writing) but this is still an enjoyable enough watch, with some gorgeous scenery and fun, if familiar, plot elements.

**Hamnet**

A return to form for Zhao. Hamnet takes what works about the book, doubles down and then rips your heart out and stomps on it. Deeply sad, but without crossing too much into emotional manipulation, Hamnet is a well-deserved People's Choice Award winner, and one of this year's best crafted films. All the same, I cannot personally say I connected with it as much as some of the other selections this year.

**Hedda**

Hedda is a unique twist on Ibsen's place, anchored by two crackling performances from Tessa Thompson and Nina Hoss. It's well shot, and adapts the story for 1930s England effectively, even if some of the changes to the play don't quite hit the mark. Biggest problem for Hedda, honestly, was coming late into the 5th day of the fest, which lead to a sleepier atmosphere than desired. Folks were tired and a period dramedy hit some like ZQuill.

**It Was Just An Accident**

If you strip away the miracle of this film's existence, and the strongly rebellious nature of its plot, It Was Just An Accident is still one of the very most effective pieces of filmmaking this year. A taut thriller, expertly paced, with immersive visuals, a story whose twists and turns keep you guessing, a highly stressful tone with the right amount of levity in points when needed, and superb performances across the board. Sprinkle in some of the most effective and haunting messages I've seen all year, and the aforementioned miraculous existence, and it honestly speaks for itself. Run (or drive fast) to see this one, just maybe keep an eye for dogs on the road.

**John Candy: I Like Me**

Good natured and effectively made, I only caught the first 75% of this film due to it starting late and creating a conflict. All the same, what I saw was a deeply moving, crowd-pleasing doc that paid tribute to Candy's life, even if it veered a little too close to a clip show at points.

**Little Lorraine**

A choppy first act almost lost me, but a brilliant performance by Stephen McHattie, and an intriguing true story at its core, kept this Nova Scotia thriller well above water. Couple it with a nuanced, soft-spoken and wholly surprising lead performance from Arrow's Stephen Amell, and I found a lot to like leaving the theatre. May not translate as well outside of Canada, but a unique true crime tale all the same.

**The Lost Bus**

The Lost Bus is one of the most disappointing movies of the year. Lizzie Johnson's brilliant book, Paradise: One Town's Struggle to Survive an American Wildfire, was an operatic, sad and moving account of what happened in the town, and the heroes at its core. Greengrass' film retains his signature shaky cam style, but the script strips away much of the true story, and the heroism of Kevin and the resilience of the town, to replace it with a heavily Hollywoodized version. Kevin can't just be a hero, now he's a deadbeat dad who doesn't trust that his Son has a cold, as well as ""the worst driver on the fleet"". The townspeople can't be helping get through the fires, now a fictional marauding band of looters come to threaten the bus. Kevin's driving is no longer smart and mature, now it's crashing through fences like Dom Toretto. It's a very unfortunate situation because at his best, Greengrass can be shockingly effective in his realism, but his aim here was to make ""a movie, not a documentary"", and as a movie, it's still been there, done there.

**Meadowlarks**

I actually saw this one at a test screener a few months before the fest and found it a gentle-hearted tale of family that doesn't shy away from tackling the horrific impacts of the 60s scoop. Tasha Hubbard successfully transitions to narrative filmmaking, and the cast is uniformly great. Don't let this one fly under the radar.

**Mile End Kicks**

A delight from start to finish. Chandler Levack brings her cringe-worthy (in the best possible way) coming-of-age stylings to a larger canvas, telling a story that is both uniquely personal, but also a strong vibes piece. Barbie Ferreira is very good, and Devon Bostick is a perfect foil to her. Just a very charming and touching film.

**Motor City**

If we were ranking films on cool visuals and awesome soundtracks alone, Motor City would be a 5 star film. Unfortunately, beneath the well done surface marks a self-indulgent, dull project that evokes the worst of Zack Snyder and 70s Grindhouse. A revenge tale with no substance, 6 lines of dialogue but several shown without sound for seemingly no reason whatsoever, and one of the roughest endings in recent memory.

**The Napa Boys**

I'm a fan of Sideways, so this film, positioned as a fourth installment in a fictional ""Sideways Presents"" series of Direct-To-Video movies (think ""American Pie Presents: The Book of Love""), piqued my interest. Early on, there is some humour to be found in the absurdity, but as the film continues, the jokes become less and less effective until by the end, I was looking for another glass of wine to get through the film.

**New Years Rev**

A charming Green Day themed road trip movie, this had some undeniable heart, good performances and a tried but true story. The problem I have with the film, quite simply, is that Green Day wrote the story, produced the film with Live Nation, and plays a crucial part in the tale. The end result does, at times, feel rather self-indulgent, and is, quite simply, the very anthesis of punk rock. With this aside, it is still a fun time that cool parents can enjoy watching with their teen and young adult children.

**Nirvanna The Band The Show The Movie**

I absolutely love Nirvanna The Band The Show, so expectations were high going into this one, especially in the wake of the stellar reviews out of SXSW. While I don't think the movie is as strong as the show (Matt and Jay still work best for me in shorter bursts), this was an incredibly funny, innovative and deeply Toronto movie that played gangbusters with the crowd. A perfect Midnight Madness fit.

**No Other Choice**

This is where I may lose some of you. Donald E. Westlake, whose works I discovered a few years back, has fast become my favourite writer. A witty, twisted mind with some of the best handles on plot in the business. His book The Ax was not just hysterical, it also helped me through a rough patch of unemployment. So, when Park Chan-Wook brought his own adaptation of The Ax to the fest, I was first in line. Unfortunately, the end result deviated a decent bit from the book, hindering its pitch perfect pacing, dark payoffs and hardened heart in favour of a more broadly farcical and satirical take. The problem for me: many of the jokes quite simply didn't land, and Park's tone (best described as a middle ground between Cyborg and Oldboy) worked against the story as much as it did for it. As a Park Chan Wook film, it's a lower-mid tier effort for me. As an adaptation of one of my very favourite books, it was a crushing letdown, but thankfully Costa-Gavras' brilliant and faithful adaptation is still on my DVD shelves to enjoy and hey, if it gets more people to read the book, it's all worthwhile to me.

**Nouvelle Vague**

A charming Linklater hangout film with a deep admiration for the style of Breathless, Nouvelle Vague isn't my favourite of Rick's films by any means, but it's still an undeniable treat for cinephiles. The cast is great, with newcomer Guillaume Marbeck shining as Godard, and the visuals strike the right balance of faithful and modern.

**Peak Everything**

Downbeat and only sporadically funny, Peak Everything was a bit of an off choice for the Closing Night film. An ""eco-doomer rom-com"", most of the jokes didn't land for me, leaving me caught in the mindset of someone up late at night worried beyond belief about the future. AKA, 100 minutes of every day of my goddamn life. The end result was a film that was well made, but a slog to get through.

**Rental Family**

Hikari's film had some crucial People's Choice Awards buzz going into it, but having seen the film, I get why it didn't place. Rental Family is a well-intentioned but sometimes overly sentimental drama with some unintentionally dark plot points (think Ms. Doubtfire, Dear Evan Hansen) that are largely treated at face value. Fraser is good in an oftentimes subdued role, but nothing here struck me as anything more than just good. That said, Hikari is delightful in person, and I loved her previous film 37 Seconds, so I will continue to watch her career and cheer from the sidelines. I just wish I had more to cheer for here.

**Retreat**

Sign-language cinema is in and it's a beautiful thing to see. As someone who works in the field of accessibility, I greatly admire the versatility and power of sign language, and it was nice to see filmmaker Ted Evans bring his take on sign language cinema to the fest. Retreat is a decently effective thriller with great performances, sharp visuals and unique audio design. A great discovery.

**Roofman**

The story of Jeffrey Manchester is batshit crazy, and Tatum and Cianfrance do a wonderful job bringing it to life in all its bonkers glory. But beneath the hidden Toys R Us apartments and robbing McDonald's through the roof like a deranged Santa Claus lies an almost Shakespearean tragedy of doomed love. And needless to say, nobody quite handles doomed love like Cianfrance. Roofman is bittersweet and sad, while also being very funny and romantic. It's a tough balance but one handled brilliantly by Cianfrance, Tatum and Dunst, who continues her hot street of exceptional performances here.

**Sacrifice**

A very messy movie, but one I cannot help but admire the audacity of. Romain Gavras' film is confused, muddled and at times incomprehensively structured, but also very funny, smart, and with several breathtakingly directed sequences. Chris Evans delivers career best work here as a well-meaning but self-involved celebrity, and the rest of the cast shine in their own moments (Vincent Cassel in particular playing a ludicrous mix of Jeff Bezos, Dr. Evil and his own costar here John Malkovich). All the same, it's an undeniable step down from the technical brilliance of Athena.

**Scarlet**

Beautifully animated but deeply confusing, Scarlet doesn't quite reach the highs of, say, Mirai, but as an unconventional take on Hamlet (a strange theme this year), it still makes for a pleasant watch.

**Sentimental Value**

The first act of this film was great, but as the story progressed, I found myself struggling to fully see why this film is getting the Oscar buzz it is. It's an undeniably good film with two strong performances from Reinsve and Skarsgard, but the drama itself felt very subdued and the central conflict a bit uninteresting. It's not a bad film by any stretch of the imagination, I'm just not quite sold yet that it's a great one. I may just need a rewatch.

**The Smashing Machine**

Dwayne Johnson can act! If it was ever in doubt, Smashing Machine will smash those expectations. He is very good here delivering a tender but tough, and eerily uncanny performance as Mark Kerr. Blunt also works wonders with an underwritten role. But is the film itself good? Yes and no. An almost shot-for-shot recreation of the doc at points, but without the pacing or brevity of it, Smashing Machine is a largely pointless exercise in cinematic Xeroxing. When it finally does deviate, what we're left with isn't exactly gripping stuff. To quote the critic seated next to me, ""What was the point of this?"". All the same, the MMA scenes are visceral and gripping, the visuals are brilliantly executed, the makeup is astonishing and as mentioned, the performances are good. But for me at least, this is the weakest Safdie effort to date.

**Steal Away**

Clement Virgo is a filmmaker I admire greatly. Which is why it is all the more unfortunate to say that Steal Away just didn't work for me. Taking inspiration from the true story of Cecelia Reynolds, a young woman who escaped slavery only to return home to save her mother, and Fanny, the daughter of the family who owned Cecelia's and later struck up a small friendship with her, Clement brings this story to a modern, fairytale inspired world, and tells the story of how Cecile (changed name) and Fanny uncover a conspiracy on Fanny's home. It's a strange blend of fantasy, sci fi and real history that is hyper ambitious but falls flat.

**The Testament of Ann Lee**

Amanda Seyfried is very good in this ambitious and impressive follow up to The Brutalist. While directed by Fastvold this time (Corbet retains writing credit), Testament is a similarly ambitious swing at recreating an older, epic style of filmmaking on a smaller budget. This time, it's a musical about the life of Ann Lee, a Shaker prophet who believed herself the reincarnation of Jesus. A strange, but often entrancing film, it didn't quite live up to the heights of Brutalist, but was evocative of Fastvold and Corbet's earlier work, with some favourable growth since those films.

**To The Victory!**

A film I admired more than I loved. The cinematography is beautiful, and the ideas at its core about the meaning of art in times of war are strong, but the overall self-reflexive ""meta"" nature of the film worked against it more than it worked for it, at least in my books. All the same, a well-crafted movie with a meaningful thesis.

**Train Dreams**

Deeply sad and close to the novella, Train Dreams is a melancholy watch strengthened by some of the finest cinematography of the year, and an astounding performance from Joel Edgerton. While not as strong as Sing Sing, this is still a moving film that I hope Netflix doesn't forget.

**Wake Up Dead Man**

Neither Knives Out or Glass Onion connected with me, so I was very hesitant going into this one. Thankfully, third time was the charm. Wake Up Dead Man is a much darker and more serious take on the franchise's signature formula, with Josh O'Connor shining as quite frankly the lead of the film. The ensemble is used less here, meaning more pressure exists on O'Connor and Craig to carry, and both are more than up to the challenge. The jokes are far less frequent, and more frequently funny, than before, and the reflection on faith is nuanced. The film reminded me a lot of my all time favourite movie ""The Ninth Configuration"" (Which coincidentally gets a shoutout in Frankenstein), down to the almost Hammer Horror setting and rumination on faith. The fact that it compares favourably speaks to the strength of the filmmaking here.

My husband asked me to go to the office ten minutes early to make coffee for his secretary When I refused, he completely lost it. 

“Sophia loves her morning coffee. Is it really that hard for you to spend ten minutes making it for 

her?” 

I shook my head, and he stormed out, slamming the door after throwing down a pile of 

documents. 

“Fine, Lily Evans, you’re fired! Don’t come back tomorrow!” 

As I looked at the papers scattered across the floor, I felt utterly disappointed in Ethan Cole. 

Without hesitation, I dialed an international number: “I’m willing to accept your offer. I’ll start next week.” 

The moment I hung up, Sophia Moore walked right into my office without even knocking, moving about as if she owned the place. 

“Lily, who were you talking to? It sounded like a man’s voice.” 

Her insinuations sparked curiosity from those outside the door, and soon everyone was craning their necks to catch the gossip. 

# Read Link: [**https://writers.spotipremiumapk.in/fired-me-1/**](https://writers.spotipremiumapk.in/fired-me-1/) 

‘Mr. Cole just stormed out angry. Don’t tell me you’re sneaking around with another man behind his back!” 

I looked her straight in the eye. “Who taught you to speak like that? Spreading sexual rumors comes with legal consequences!” 

Sophia scoffed. “Please. I’m just stating facts. Even if Mr. Cole walked back in right now, I’d say the same thing.” 

I glared at her and turned to leave, but she grabbed my arm. Leaning closer, she lowered her voice into a threat. 

‘Lily Evans, you’d better step away from Ethan. I’m the one he wants now.” 

‘If you know what’s good for you, divorce him and get out of this company. Otherwise, don’t blame me for what comes next.” 

I couldn’t believe how far a mere secretary thought she could go. 

Just as I was about to shake her off, she suddenly flung herself to the ground. 

“Ethan, you’re finally back!” 

I turned toward the doorway and saw Ethan Cole storming in, fury in his eyes. 

Without a word, his hand cracked across my face. 

I stumbled back, hitting the edge of the coffee table, pain spreading instantly across my temple. 

“Lily Evans, what are you doing?!” 

Before I could speak, Sophia burst into tears, playing her part. 

“Mr. Cole, Lily told me to pick up the papers on the floor. I was a little slow, so she shoved me down! My ankle feels twisted-it hurts so much!” 

2/3 6.7% 

Her pitiful act tugged at Ethan’s heartstrings. He knelt beside her, worried and tender, completely ignoring the blood on my forehead and the red marks across my cheek. 

“Where does it hurt? I’ll call a doctor for you right now.” 

“I’ll have them prescribe the best medicine-you’ll recover quickly, I promise.” 

Sophia leaned into his arms, but her eyes flicked toward me with a smug smile. 

“No need, Mr. Cole… It’s my fault. I shouldn’t have upset Lily. She’s just in a bad mood lately Once she vents, she’ll be fine. I’m okay.” 

“She’s in a bad mood, so she gets to shove people?” Ethan snapped, his eyes sharp as ice. 

“When did you become so vicious, Lily Evans?” 

Wicious? My fingers brushed the warm blood on my temple. Three years of marriage-managing his company’s affairs, caring for his sick mother, even pawning my inheritance jewelry during his Failed startup-and in his eyes, I was nothing but a cruel woman. 

“I didn’t push her.” 

forced my voice steady, though the pain had already numbed me. 

“There are security cameras outside this office. Check the footage and you’ll know.” 

Sophia’s face went pale. She clung tighter to Ethan’s sleeve. 

“Mr. Cole, I forgive Lily. Let’s just forget about today, okay?”",2,1757996702.0,Novelnews,3,1.0,False

1ni7tr8,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/1ni7tr8/opinions_on_gentrification/,Opinions on gentrification,"In light of a conundrum I've been having, both out of curiosity and to distract myself from the currently extremely polarised online political discourse (you know which event I'm talking about), I would like to ask this sub's thoughts and opinions on a hopefully comparatively less controversial phenomenon (maybe not really, but I just need something on my mind other than you-know-what). Namely, gentrification.

**What is our stance on the phenomenon of gentrification?**

**How do we, as social democrats/social liberals/democratic socialists/market socialists etc., address the cited effects of community displacement, particularly of historically-marginalised demographics?**

But perhaps most importantly, and the reason for my conundrum, **how do we reconcile those effects of gentrification with the goals of urban renewal, addressing the housing crisis, and counteracting NIMBYism?**

I've heard it said multiple times that the key to addressing urban decay and car-dependency and especially the housing crisis, is to loosen urban zoning laws (e.g. remove parking minimums) to allow for the proliferation of mixed-used housing, the development of walkable cities and remove car-dependency for everyday life that you would otherwise see in a suburb of single-family housing. Which would likely entail incentivising people to move out of single-family housing and into urban cores. But with how gentrification is often cited as displacing inner-city communities via investment driving up real estate prices and the aforementioned affluent residents moving in pricing them out, I'm just wondering how do we reconcile those two phenomena?

Like, how do we reconcile investing into urban renewal and promoting walkable cities and de-car-dependency (for lack of a better term) with possible displacement/pricing-out of inner-city communities - especially those belonging to marginalised demographics? Especially when I read about the anti-gentrification protests in places like [Benezet Court](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/717926) in the 1950s, [East Harlem](https://web.archive.org/web/20161120150713/http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/35625-participatory-democracy-drives-anti-gentrification-movement-in-new-york-s-el-barrio) in 2016, the [2015 Cereal Killer Cafe protests in East London](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/27/shoreditch-cereal-cafe-targeted-by-anti-gentrification-protesters), the [2014 San Francisco tech bus protests](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/25/google-bus-protest-swells-to-revolt-san-francisco), the 2017 ink! Coffee protest in Denver, and [the Mexico City protests this July by locals accusing American residents of increasing rent value to three times what a local can afford](https://apnews.com/article/mexico-mass-tourism-protest-gentrification-56aef1432e05e8b541f14f3f25926505). How do we deal with NIMBYism and gentrification both?

Maybe there is already a way to reconcile urban renewal with gentrification and I just haven't heard of it yet. Maybe I'm asking the wrong question regarding the contradiction between addressing housing crisis and community displacement. Maybe there is *no conflict* between addressing NIMBYism and gentrification and I'm just an idiot. Either way, I am hoping my ideological brethren here can help enlighten me as to where we stand on the phenomenon of gentrification and its effects.

My dad went like a month ago or something on tinder and found this girl. He talked with her a lot is what I have heard.

Like you don’t even know my dad and they never fucking met. So why would she help him gain money like it’s nothing. He invested €500 into crypto. So that’s a lot.

The thing is, I saw pictures of her and I swear to God I think it’s AI. Like there is almost no doubt.

Waiting for boarding.,"It feels such a usual day. I took the metro. Got a nice perfume from the duty free. People work at the airport. Others run around to find their gates.

I got bit icky only because my gate is downstairs, so it means we will go to the plane by bus. Which I don't like. I always take a closer look to the aircraft then and notice weird things (the gas smell, mechanics voice...)

I asked for the very behind seat, corridor as usual.

Having a coffee now.

I'd be so happy if someone can track me 😊 if anyone is willing, send me private message that I can share my flight details.

Thank you and wish me luck please 🥹
