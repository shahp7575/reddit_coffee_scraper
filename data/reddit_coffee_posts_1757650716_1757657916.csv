Hello, I have some questions regarding this transaction. Since it is considered as perishable goods, does the sales return amounting to ₱600 mean that it refers to 3 cups? Based on the previous transaction where 35 cups were worth ₱7,000, it seems that 1 cup is priced at ₱200. Using that as a basis, I assumed the sales return of ₱600 corresponds to 3 cups. With that in mind, is it correct to make the following journal entry? Debit: Loss on Inventory ₱300 Credit: Inventory ₱300 (This is assuming the cost of goods sold per cup is ₱100, so for 3 cups, the total COGS is ₱300.)

She saw it. His Gmail. And there, like a beacon of disaster, a name that made her stomach clench. Samantha.

""God, today was brutal without you. You always know exactly what to say to make me laugh.""

From: Daniel

""You're the best part of my day. Sometimes I think you're the only person who really understands me anymore.""

The best part of his day.

Not coming home.

Not their life.

Not the child growing inside her.

From: Daniel

""Every day. But it's complicated. The baby...""

The baby. Not her. Not their marriage. Just a complication to navigate around.

But the worst was yet to come.

""Sometimes I look at her and feel nothing. Just ... emptiness. And that scares of me. I don't know when I stopped loving her, but I can't find my way back. I don't think I want to anymore.""

Feel nothing. Rhea's legs gave out. She sank to the kitchen floor. She have a baby coming and a husband who can't stand to be in the same room with her.

The Distance

""Some heartbreaks don't shatter you all at once. They dissolve you, piece by piece, until you barely recognize the person you once were."" — Beau Taplin

The late afternoon sun spilled into the living room, casting long, muted beams across the walls.

Rhea shifted on the couch, one hand braced against her aching back, the other stroking the curve of her belly. The baby moved inside her — slow and steady — a quiet, persistent drumbeat of life.

Eight months along. Another four weeks — maybe less — and everything would change.

She shifted again, wincing, and glanced at the clock. 6:45 p.m. Daniel was late again. No text. No call.

She pressed her palm against her ribs, trying to ease the tightness that had nothing to do with the baby. The words came automatically now — he's busy, work is stressful — like a prayer she'd memorized but no longer believed.

Still, the silence gnawed at her.

It hadn't always been like this.

Once, five years ago, Daniel had smiled at her across a crowded bookstore — clutching a half-read novel in one hand and a coffee in the other — and asked if she believed in fate. She had laughed, skeptical and charmed all at once. She didn't — not really. But she had given him her number, anyway.

Their first date had been a comedy of errors: wrong restaurant, rain pouring halfway through dinner, Daniel slipping on the sidewalk as he gallantly offered her his jacket. They ended up in a tiny diner, sharing soggy fries and laughing so hard Rhea thought her ribs might crack. He pecked her that night — under flickering neon lights — and whispered, clumsy and earnest, ""I think I found my person.""

She hadn't believed in soulmates before him.

She wasn't sure she believed in them now. But for a while — a bright, impossibly golden while — he made her want to.

Her fingers found the thin band on her left hand, twisting it unconsciously. The diamond caught the dying light, throwing tiny rainbows on the wall — beautiful, empty promises dancing across the paint they'd chosen together.

Now, sitting alone in the house they had once dreamed of filling with laughter and tiny footsteps, Rhea wondered where that boy had gone — the one who slipped on sidewalks and pecked her like she was the only girl in the world. The man she waited for now felt like a stranger wearing his face.

Five years ago, barefoot on a beach beneath a sky full of stars, they had promised forever. Back then, forever had felt unbreakable — something they could reach for without fear.

Even when they learned she was pregnant — terrified but thrilled — Daniel had been her anchor. He had gone to every appointment, held her hand through the nausea, whispered to her belly each night before sleep.

They talked about names. Painted dreams together.

But somewhere around the fourth month, things began to shift.

At first, it was just an extra late night here and there. Business dinners. Projects. Nothing suspicious. Nothing terrible.

Life. Stress. Growing pains.

By the fifth month, late nights became a pattern.

She often ate alone, pushing cold food around her plate, telling herself it wasn't a big deal. The baby would kick, and she'd place her hand over the movement, pretending Daniel's hand was there too.

At six months, Samantha's name started slipping into conversation.

Casual. Easy.

""Samantha helped me fix the client deck. Samantha thinks the new strategy's smart.""

By seven months, Daniel laughed at his phone more than he laughed with her.

Now, at eight months pregnant, Rhea could barely remember the last time they had planned their future together.

The front door creaked open.

Daniel stepped inside, tossing his keys into the bowl like always. He paused longer than usual, hand against the doorframe, trying to shake the tension from his shoulders.

Don't start a fight. Act normal. Pretend.

The faint scent of dinner still clung to the air — her perfume too, that vanilla scent he used to bury his face in. Guilt prickled at the back of his throat.

He hadn't meant to be this late. Hadn't meant to eat without her.

Work had bled into drinks with the team, and Samantha had laughed at something he'd said — head thrown back, genuine, uncomplicated. For a little while, he felt like the man he used to be. The one who made people laugh. The one who wasn't drowning in responsibilities he never asked for. The guilt hit him before he even reached for his keys.

He rubbed the back of his neck and stepped into the living room, forcing a tired smile.

""Sorry I'm late,"" he said, avoiding her eyes.

Rhea smiled back — careful, practiced. A polite stranger's smile.

It hit harder than he expected.

""Did you eat already?"" she asked softly.

""Yeah,"" he said, peeling off his jacket. ""Grabbed something with the team.""

He saw the way her hand instinctively moved to her belly. Saw it — and pretended not to. The sight of her, round with his child, beautiful and exhausted, made something twist in his chest. When had looking at her started to hurt?

""Good,"" she whispered.

He mumbled a half-hearted ""thanks"" and disappeared into the kitchen, desperate for something — anything — to do.

Rhea stayed on the couch, listening to the hollow sounds of a life unraveling. The baby shifted, pressing what felt like a tiny foot against her ribs, and she rubbed the spot gently. ""I know, little one,"" she murmured. ""I miss him too.""

Later that night, she sat curled on the couch, flipping through the unopened baby book they had bought months ago.

The pages were blank.

No milestones.

No memories pasted in.

No ultrasound photos.

It wasn't just the book.

It was the missed prenatal appointment she sat through alone. The maternity photos he kept promising to take, then forgetting. The nursery walls still bare, where once they had planned to paint clouds and stars.

It was the photo she stumbled across on his phone last week — Samantha standing too close, her smile too familiar, her hand on his arm.

It wasn't one huge thing.

It was the thousand tiny fractures, the slow, invisible breaking.

Rhea curled tighter into herself, feeling the baby shift within her, wondering how much more of her could disappear before no one even noticed.

The sound of laughter drifted from the kitchen — easy, light.

Curious, Rhea rose and padded quietly down the hallway, one hand supporting her lower back, the other braced against the wall.

She paused at the doorway.

Daniel stood at the counter, phone pressed to his ear, smiling in a way he hadn't smiled at her in months.

""You're the only thing keeping me sane today,"" he said warmly.

A beat of silence.

Then another laugh — low, intimate.

Something twisted low in her gut — not the baby, something darker. Her bare feet felt frozen to the floor, toes curling against the cold hardwood as his laughter wrapped around another woman's name like a caress.

She cleared her throat softly.

Daniel turned, startled. Guilt flickered across his face before smoothing into casualness. He ended the call quickly and slipped his phone into his pocket.

""Hey,"" he said lightly. ""Didn't hear you.""

""Who was that?"" she asked, though she already knew.

""Samantha,"" he answered, too casually. ""Just venting about work. Nothing serious.""

""Just a friend,"" he added, the words falling like stones between them.

Rhea nodded.

Smiled.

And felt something small and sacred inside her quietly fracture.

Her fingers tightened on the doorframe, knuckles white. For a moment, rage flared hot in her chest — she wanted to grab his phone, to scream, to make him see her, really see her. But the baby moved, and the fight drained out of her as quickly as it came.

""I'm going to bed,"" she said instead, her voice steady as glass.

That night, Daniel lay awake, staring at the ceiling.

The space between them yawned wider with every heartbeat. He could hear her breathing, uneven, probably crying silently like she thought he couldn't tell. His chest tightened.

It wasn't that he didn't love her.

He did.

But sometimes when she looked at him — asking about baby names or nursery colors — all he felt was the suffocating pressure of how much he was already failing. When she showed him paint samples, all he saw were walls closing in. When she talked about the future, all he heard was the sound of doors slamming shut on the life he'd never have.

It was easier to work late.

Easier to laugh with someone who didn't need anything from him.

He hated himself for it.

And some nights, he was too tired to hate himself at all.

The days blurred.

Daniel missed another birthing class. Rhea sat between two couples, watching partners practice breathing exercises, her own breath catching in her throat.

Forgot about the maternity shoot. She found herself standing in front of the mirror, trying to see herself the way a camera would. Beautiful. Glowing. Lying.

Worked later and later.

Rhea stopped reminding him.

Somewhere deep inside, she stopped expecting him to show up at all.

She carried it all — the hope, the fear, the loneliness — alone.

Some nights, she whispered to the baby: ""I'm still here. I'll always be here.""

Because some part of her already knew she would have to be enough for both of them.

It was a Thursday night when the truth finally settled on her chest like a stone.

They sat on opposite ends of the couch — Daniel tapping something on his laptop, Rhea holding a book she couldn't seem to read.

She tried to break the silence. ""Hey, do you want to watch that new show we talked about? The one with the time travelers?""

Daniel didn't look up. ""Maybe later,"" he said. ""I have to finish this report.""

She nodded, setting the book aside. The baby book caught her eye on the coffee table — still wrapped in cellophane, untouched. She picked it up, turning it over in her hands.

""I was thinking,"" she said carefully, ""maybe we could work on this together this weekend? Fill in some of the pages?""

His typing never slowed. ""Sure, babe. Whatever you want.""

The dismissal in his voice was so casual, so complete, that something finally snapped. She gripped the book harder, the plastic crinkling.

""Daniel.""

He looked up then, irritation flickering across his features. ""What? I said yes.""

""You said 'whatever you want.' Like I asked you to pick up milk."" Her voice trembled. ""This is our baby's book. Our baby.""

He sighed, rubbing his face. ""I know. I'm sorry. I'm just—""

""Busy. Stressed. Tired."" She finished for him, the words bitter in her mouth. ""I know.""

The distance between them wasn't just physical. It had become a silent agreement, an invisible wall neither dared to name.

She looked at him, really looked.

His hair was messier now, longer than he liked it. His face was tired, the frown lines deeper. He was the same man she loved, but he felt miles away, like he was halfway gone already, only the ghost of his presence remaining.

She wanted to call out to him. To grab his hand. To shake him and say, Don't you feel it too? Aren't you scared?

But fear kept her silent. Fear that maybe he had already felt it — and accepted it.

When Daniel finally closed his laptop and stood, he pecked the top of her head absently, like someone greeting a coworker or an old friend out of habit. Not a man in love.

The smell of his cologne lingered — different now, sharper. When had he changed it?

""I'm going to bed,"" he said simply.

""I'll be up in a minute,"" Rhea replied, her voice steady.

He nodded and disappeared down the hallway, the bedroom door clicking shut behind him.

Rhea sat there a long time after he left, the baby book still in her lap, her wedding rings clicking against the plastic as her hands shook. The sound seemed too loud in the empty room.

She opened the book slowly, running her fingers across the empty pages. ""Baby's First Smile."" ""First Word."" ""First Steps.""

All those firsts Daniel might miss. All those moments she might celebrate alone.

A tear dropped onto the page, and she quickly wiped it away, not wanting to stain the pristine paper with her sadness.

The baby moved again, strong and insistent, as if reminding her: I'm here. I'm real. I'm coming whether he's ready or not.

""I know, sweet one,"" she whispered, closing the book. ""I know.""



The Leaving

""He left in the same way that people leave the cinema — quietly, in the dark, before the end."" — Warsan Shire

Before dawn, Daniel woke with a start. The bedroom was still dark, but he could make out Rhea's silhouette in the grey pre-morning light. She was sleeping on her side, the only position comfortable now, one hand curved protectively over her belly, her face pale against the pillow.

He could see the dried tears at the corners of her eyes.

He wanted to peck her forehead.

To promise he would be better.

To wake her gently and say all the things he'd swallowed down for months.

But the words stuck in his throat like shards of glass.

He dressed quietly in the dark, muscle memory guiding him. His clothes from the chair. Socks from the drawer — second one down, left side, so it wouldn't squeak. He'd learned all the silent ways to leave without waking her.

His phone buzzed on the nightstand. He grabbed it quickly, afraid the vibration would wake her.

Samantha: ""Coffee before the Morrison meeting?""

He stared at the message, thumb hovering over the screen.

Just coffee.

Just a meeting.

Just another lie he'd tell himself.

The bathroom light would wake her, so he moved through the bedroom door instead, carrying his shoes.

He paused in the hallway.

He stood in the nursery doorway — still unpainted, still empty. They'd argued about colors months ago. Sage green, she'd wanted. Or maybe soft yellow, gender neutral, hopeful. He'd said yes to everything and done nothing.

A mobile hung from the ceiling, the only sign of the life they were supposed to be preparing for. Tiny elephants circled slowly in the draft from the heating vent, casting shadows on the blank walls. He reached up, stopped their movement with one finger.

In the silence, he could hear Rhea's breathing from their bedroom. Even trusting. She still slept like someone who believed he'd be there when she woke.

His chest constricted. When had he become this man? The one who left before dawn. The one who chose coffee with another woman over breakfast with his pregnant wife.

The elephants waited, frozen beneath his touch.

He could go back. Crawl into bed. Cancel the coffee. Show up for once.

His phone buzzed again.

Samantha: ""I'll bring those reports you wanted to review.""

Work. It was just work. He was providing. Being responsible. Doing what needed to be done.

The lies came so easily now.

He let the elephants spin free and typed back: ""Yes.""

In the kitchen, he moved through the routine. Coffee. Keys. Wallet. The mundane choreography of leaving.

He paused at the sink, noticing Rhea's prenatal vitamins lined up on the windowsill. Seven bottles. One for each month she'd been taking them. She'd kept them all like trophies of endurance.

A photo on the refrigerator caught his eye — from her last ultrasound. He'd missed that appointment, too. Emergency client meeting. Couldn't be helped.

The baby's profile was perfect. Tiny nose. Perfect lips. His child, growing without him.

He grabbed a pen, thought about leaving a note. But what would he say?

""Sorry, I'm a coward.""

""Sorry I'm suffocating.""

""Sorry, I don't know how to be what you need.""

The pen hovered over the notepad. The words wouldn't come. They never did anymore.

He set the pen down.

What good were promises now?

He turned away from the counter, from the vitamins, from the ultrasound photo he'd never really looked at.

Quiet steps across the kitchen floor.

No note.

No peck goodbye.

No explanation.

The front door clicked shut behind him, the morning chill rushing in. The neighborhood was still sleeping, houses dark, the world holding its breath before dawn.

In the car, he sat for a moment, watching their bedroom window. Part of him waited for the light to flick on, for her to appear, to call him back.

But the window stayed dark.

He started the engine and pulled away, telling himself it was just another day. Just another morning. Just another small betrayal in a series that had become his life.

Inside, Rhea woke to an empty bed, her hand reaching across cold sheets. She knew before she opened her eyes. The absence had its own weight, its own temperature.

The pillow still smelled faintly of his cologne — the old one, the one she'd bought him for their anniversary. She pressed her face into it, breathing deep, trying to hold onto something that was already gone.

No note on his pillow.

No peck on her forehead.

No whispered ""see you tonight.""

She rose slowly, hand braced against the mattress, back screaming in protest. The baby was low today, heavy, pressing down with urgent possibility. She moved forward — one hand on her belly, the other gripping the furniture for support — because she had to. Because the baby didn't care about heartbreak.

Only survival.

In the hallway, she paused at the nursery. The elephants on the mobile spun lazy circles, disturbed by some recent touch. Her heart clenched. He'd been here. Stood in this doorway. Looked at this empty room that should have been ready by now.

Even so, he'd left.

In the kitchen, she found his coffee mug in the sink. Still warm. He'd been here, alive in this space, and chosen to leave without a word. The notepad sat on the counter, the pen beside it. Blank.

All those words are unwritten.

All those mornings unseized.

All those chances ungrasped.

She set the table for two out of habit, then stood staring at the empty chair.

The placemat.

The coffee cup.

The space where he should be.

Slowly, like admitting defeat, she removed the second plate. Put away the extra mug. Adjusted her life to accommodate absence.

Her wedding rings caught on the drawer handle as she closed it, the sound sharp in the quiet kitchen. She looked down at them — engagement ring and wedding band, nestled together. Promises made. Promises breaking.

And somewhere deep inside her, something finally whispered:

This isn't just a rough patch. This isn't just stress or work or adjustment.

Something precious is slipping away.

And he wasn't reaching for her to stop it.

She placed both hands on her belly, feeling the stubborn life pushing against her palms. The baby rolled, restless, ready. With or without Daniel. Ready or not.

""It's okay,"" she whispered to the baby, to herself, to the empty room. ""We're going to be okay.""

But her voice cracked on the last word, and she knew — some lies were too heavy for hope to carry.

She stood there, eight months pregnant and utterly alone, watching the sun creep across the kitchen floor. Another day beginning. Another day to pretend everything was fine.

Another day to practice being enough for two.

The coffee maker gurgled, finishing its cycle. She'd made enough for two, like always.

Like always, she poured just one cup.



The First Day Alone

""The world doesn't stop for your broken heart. The sun still rises, coffee still needs making, and life demands you keep living even when you're barely breathing."" — Nikita Gill

The coffee had gone cold.

Rhea stared at the brown ring it left on the kitchen table, tracing the stain with her finger. Three hours since Daniel left. Three hours of sitting in this chair, watching the morning transform from grey to gold to the harsh white light of full day.

The baby hadn't stopped moving. Rolling and pressing, as if sensing the shift in their small universe.

She needed to get up. Needed to shower, eat something, pretend this was just another day. But her body felt weighted to the chair, bones heavy with a grief she couldn't yet name.

Her phone buzzed. Sarah.

""Pregnancy yoga in 20? I can pick you up!""

Rhea stared at the message. She'd forgotten. Every Tuesday, for the past two months, she and Sarah had gone together. Sarah with her perfect bump, perfect husband, perfect preparation for her perfect first baby.

Her thumbs hovered over the screen.

""Not feeling well today. Maybe next week?""

The lie came easily. Easier than explaining that her husband had left before dawn. Easier than admitting she'd been sitting in yesterday's clothes, unable to move from this chair.

Three dots appeared. Disappeared. Appeared again.

""Are you okay? Really?""

Sarah knew. Of course she knew. She'd seen the way Daniel looked through Rhea at the last prenatal class they'd all attended together. The way he'd excused himself three times to take calls. The way Rhea had smiled too brightly, laughed too quickly, overcompensating for his absence even when he was in the room.

""I'm fine. Just tired.""

Another lie. They were piling up now. A wall between her and the world.

The house felt different in the daylight. Larger. Emptier. Every sound amplified — the refrigerator's hum, the settling of wood, her own breathing. She'd never noticed how much noise Daniel made just existing in the space. His absence had its own sound.

Finally, she pushed herself up from the table. Her back screamed in protest, the baby's weight pulling her forward. She gripped the counter, waiting for the dizziness to pass.

The breakfast dishes still sat in the sink. His coffee mug. Her untouched toast. Evidence of a morning that had started with the pretense of normalcy.

She turned on the water, watched it run over his mug. Watched the last traces of his coffee swirl down the drain.

The phone rang. The landline — the one they'd kept for emergencies and telemarketers. She almost didn't answer, but habit made her reach for it.

""Rhea? It's Mom.""

Her mother's voice, bright with Tuesday morning energy, felt like an assault.

""Hi, Mom.""

""I'm at the fabric store. What color did you decide for the nursery curtains? I found the most beautiful sage green, and there's a pattern with little elephants that would match that mobile you bought.""

The elephants. The ones still spinning in the empty nursery.

""I..."" Rhea's voice cracked. She cleared her throat, tried again. ""We haven't decided yet.""

""Well, you'd better hurry. Only four weeks left! Is Daniel there? Maybe I should speak to him about finally painting those walls.""

""He's at work.""

""Already? It's barely nine. That boy works too hard.""

Rhea almost laughed. The sound caught in her throat, transforming into something else. A sob. Sharp and sudden.

""Rhea? Honey?""

""I have to go, Mom. Morning sickness.""

She hung up before her mother could respond. Before the questions could start. Before she had to admit that her husband wasn't at work. That she didn't know where he was. That he'd left without saying goodbye.

The nursery door stood open down the hall. She'd been avoiding it, but now she found herself drawn forward. Her hand braced against the wall, supporting herself as she moved.

The room smelled like possibility. Like fresh paint primer and new carpet. Like dreams deferred.

The crib, still in its box, leaned against one wall. The changing table, half-assembled, Daniel's tools scattered around it like abandoned promises. He'd started it three weeks ago. ""I'll finish it this weekend,"" he'd said.

Every weekend since.

She lowered herself into the rocking chair — the only complete piece of furniture in the room. They'd bought it together, back when they still held hands in stores. Back when choosing things for their baby felt like joy instead of burden.

The elephants continued their slow dance above her. She reached up, caught one gently.

""Your daddy was here this morning,"" she whispered to the empty room, to the baby, to herself. ""He touched these elephants. Stood in this doorway. Thought about us.""

But not enough to stay.

The baby kicked hard up under her ribs. A protest. A reminder. Life didn't pause for heartbreak.

Her phone buzzed again. She expected Sarah, but Daniel's name appeared on the screen.

Her heart stopped. Started. Raced.

""In meetings all day. Will be late tonight. Don't wait up.""

As if it were any other Tuesday.

As if he hadn't left in the dark.

As if she hadn't woken to cold sheets and silence.

Her fingers shook as she typed back: ""Okay.""

She stared at the screen, willing more words to appear. An explanation. An apology. Anything.

The typing bubbles appeared.

Her breath caught.

They disappeared.

Nothing.

She threw the phone across the room. It hit the wall where the growth chart should go, where they should mark their child's height year after year. The case cracked, but the screen stayed intact.

Like her. Cracked but functioning. Broken, but not quite broken enough.

The doorbell rang.

Rhea froze. She wasn't expecting anyone. Couldn't face anyone. Not like this — unwashed, unseeing, undone.

It rang again. Then knocking.

""Rhea? I know you're home. I saw your car.""

Sarah. Of course.

""I brought tea,"" she called through the door. ""And those cookies you like? The ginger ones.""

Rhea wanted to hide. To pretend. To disappear into the floorboards.

Instead, she struggled to her feet and made her way to the door.

Sarah stood on the porch, a yoga mat under one arm, concern written across her face. She took one look at Rhea, and her expression shifted.

""Oh, honey.""

That's all it took. Two words, soft with understanding, and the wall Rhea had built crumbled.

The tears came hard and sudden. Ugly tears. Body-shaking sobs that started somewhere deep and tore through her like contractions.

Sarah dropped everything and pulled her into an embrace, holding her as she shook.

""He left,"" Rhea gasped between sobs. ""This morning. Before dawn. He just ... left.""

Sarah guided her inside to the couch. Held her while she cried. Didn't ask questions. Didn't offer platitudes. Just sat with her in the disaster of it.

When the sobs finally slowed, Sarah quietly made tea. Found tissues. Opened the cookies neither of them would eat.

""How long have things been bad?"" she asked gently.

""I don't know,"" Rhea whispered. ""Months. Maybe longer. I kept thinking it would get better. That after the baby came..."" she trailed off.

""Has he done this before? Left saying nothing?""

""Not like this."" Rhea wrapped her hands around the warm mug. ""He's been pulling away. Working late. There's ... there's someone else. At his office. Samantha.""

The name tasted bitter.

Sarah's face darkened. ""Are you sure?""

""He laughs when she calls. Really laughs. He hasn't laughed with me in..."" Rhea couldn't finish. Couldn't remember.

They sat in silence, the weight of it all settling between them.

""What are you going to do?"" Sarah asked finally.

""I don't know."" Rhea's hand found her belly. ""I have four weeks. Maybe less. I can't ... I can't do this alone.""

""You're not alone,"" Sarah said firmly.

""You have me, you have your family, you have—""

""I have a baby coming and a husband who can't stand to be in the same room with me."" The words came out harsh. True.

Sarah didn't contradict her. Didn't soften it. Just nodded.

""Then we start there,"" she said. ""One day at a time. One hour at a time if we have to. Today, you shower. You eat. You take your vitamins. Tomorrow, we figure out tomorrow.""

""I can't even get off this couch.""

""Then we start smaller. One breath. Then another. Then maybe a sip of tea.""

Rhea looked at her friend — really looked. Saw her own fear reflected. Sarah was seven months pregnant with a loving husband and a painted nursery and everything Rhea was supposed to have. And here she sat, holding Rhea's broken pieces without judgment.

""I'm scared,"" Rhea admitted.

""I know. Be scared. But be scared while moving forward. This baby needs you functioning.""

The baby. Always the baby. The one constant in all of this chaos.

Rhea took a breath. Then another. Then a sip of tea.

It was a start.

The afternoon stretched on. Sarah stayed, her presence an anchor. She didn't fill the silence with meaningless chatter. Didn't try to fix what couldn't be fixed. She simply existed in the space, a reminder that Rhea wasn't entirely alone.

At some point, Rhea showered. The hot water felt like a small mercy, washing away the salt of dried tears if not the ache beneath them. She stood under the spray, one hand braced against the tile, the other cradling her belly.

""We're going to be okay,"" she whispered, echoing her morning promise. This time, it felt less like a lie and more like a question she might someday answer.

When she emerged, Sarah had tidied the kitchen. The breakfast dishes were done. The coffee maker cleaned. Small acts of kindness that felt enormous.

""You should eat,"" Sarah said, sliding a plate across the counter. Simple things. Toast. Sliced apples. Prenatal vitamins lined up like tiny soldiers.

Rhea ate mechanically, her body accepting fuel even as her heart rejected the normalcy of it.

The baby moved, responding to the food, and for a moment she could almost pretend this was just another Tuesday. That Daniel would walk through that door tonight, tired but present. That they would talk about their days, plan their weeks, build their future.

But the afternoon light was already fading, and her phone remained silent except for work emails she couldn't bring herself to read.

""I should go,"" Sarah said eventually, reluctantly. ""But I can stay if you need me. Mark will understand.""

Mark. Who showed up to every appointment. Who spent weekends assembling furniture and painting clouds on nursery walls? Who touched Sarah's belly with wonder instead of obligation.

""I'm okay,"" Rhea lied. Then, more honestly, ""I will be okay.""

Sarah hugged her at the door, fierce and protective. ""Call me. Any time. Three in the morning, I don't care. You're not doing this alone.""

After she left, the house felt even emptier. But somehow, the emptiness felt different. Less like abandonment and more like space.

Space to breathe.

Space to think.

Space to begin figuring out what came next.

Rhea sat in the living room as darkness crept in, her hand moving in slow circles over her belly. The baby responded, pressing back against her palm. A conversation without words. A promise without conditions.

Her phone buzzed. Daniel again.

""Staying at the office tonight. Big deadline. Don't wait up.""

She stared at the words until they blurred. He wasn't even trying to make the lies believable anymore.

She didn't respond. There was nothing left to say in the language they'd been speaking — the careful dialect of pretense and politeness that had replaced their marriage.

Instead, she did something else.

She ordered paint.

Sage green, like her mother suggested. Enough for the whole nursery. Express delivery.

It was a minor act of defiance. A tiny declaration of independence. But as she hit 'confirm order,' something shifted inside her. A microscopic tectonic plate sliding into a new position.

Tomorrow, she would paint those walls herself if she had to.

Tomorrow, she would stop waiting for him to show up.

Tomorrow, she would begin the work of being enough.

But tonight, she would sit in this empty house, in yesterday's pajamas, counting the baby's movements like a rosary of hope. Tonight, she would let herself feel the full weight of what was ending.

Because some grief demands witness, even if you're the only one there to see it.

The stars appeared one by one in the darkening sky, indifferent and eternal. Rhea watched them through the window, her hand never leaving her belly, anchoring herself to the one love that wouldn't leave before dawn.

""Just you and me, little one,"" she whispered. ""We'll figure it out.""

And somewhere deep inside, beneath the fear and the hurt and the crushing loneliness, something else stirred. Small but stubborn.

Not quite hope.

But maybe the shadow of it.

Maybe that was enough to begin.

I'm (19F) writing this about 20 minutes after a **very** heated argument with my dad about my dog, Kuma, a ten-year-old cavachon mix. We've had her for about a year, and the process of rescuing her is a doozy, to say the least. My dad actually stole her from my crazy aunt's house because she was being horribly neglected. My aunt also lived with my grandpa, so my dad would go over there to visit pretty much every week, and every week, Kuma was there. She was always dirty, a little too skinny, and her nails were badly overgrown. After a while and a very bad falling out between him and his sister, my dad decided he had enough and took the dog. Since then, she's been ours and I love her with all my heart. My dad is actually her favorite person. She follows him around absolutely everywhere. He is a fifth grade teacher and is often the last of the family to arrive home on any weeknight, and when he does, Kuma goes bounding towards the door to meet him every time.

There's your context. My dad and all of my family loves Kuma with all our hearts. A few hours ago, when my dad was settling in on the couch with a pastry and some coffee, he went to the kitchen to grab something. I was sitting across from him, watching a movie with my headphones on. Kuma grabbed his pastry from the coffee table and ate it in probably two bites. He came back to find the pastry gone and my dog licking her lips with satisfaction. I got up to see the carnage and noticed a small black dot on the paper towel the pastry was just on. It was a raisin. I checked the pastry packaging in the kitchen, and sure enough, the pastries were dotted with raisins. I tried not to freak out, but told him we should be watching her like a hawk should anything happen. He agreed and continued to lounge around. When I told my mom and sister, they had a similar reaction. My dad is not the type to take my dog to the vet when she eats something she isn't supposed to (which she's done many times and has miraculously been fine), so he didn't think anything was going to happen. But this was different. Ingesting grapes or raisins can be deadly for dogs as they are extremely toxic and can lead to kidney failure and death if left untreated. I talked with my mom and sister who were already on the phone for a veterinary office and a poison control center.

To be clear, I **was** internally freaking out. The reason I didn't immediately jump into action was because I knew he would get angry, and that's exactly what he did, because he wanted to do nothing and continue monitoring her. When my mom and sister began to talk to veterinary offices, I started getting nervous that he would explode in anger. This was a matter of life and death for my dog. He was angry because we ""ignored him"" and used a majority rules tactic to get our way. At least that's how he saw it. He wanted to monitor her for at least another hour or two, but the signs of kidney failure that can be caused by eating grapes or raisins can take up to 12 hours to present themselves, and by then, critical damage has already been done. His own self-righteousness and desire to be correct that nothing was going to happen to the dog led to him getting extremely angry, yelling at everyone. I took my dog to the car and stayed with her while he argued with my mom and sister. They left with Kuma and my dad and I went back inside, immediately arguing. He didn't want to listen to me at all. I literally begged him to listen to me with tears streaming down my face. I had to close the windows and doors so the neighbors wouldn't hear. He told me to shut up, and when I tried to get his attention one more time, he turned the TV on and cranked the volume to the max to drown out my voice. I called him ""fucking ridiculous"" and stormed off to my room. I'm still waiting for an update from my mom and sister. I'm only 19 years old.

**Chapter 3**

**Tribe Mentality**



Oltuck considered the scattered papers and folders, the mess now threatening to spill over onto the floor. 

Alnure had brought him a box with multiple folders in it, labeled *‘Unifier Candidates’*. 

Oltuck hadn’t been exactly surprised. But it had reminded him that this was a predatory species. The galactic community so far featured eighteen sophonts, of which thirteen were counted as herbivoric, two were obligate carnivores, and two were omnivores. The Humans and Rothals were about to bring that count up to four omnivores.

The Drakken were classified as herbivores. Though Oltuck tried not to think too hard about how his species would truly be classified if the galactic community only knew.

Of the members of the galactic council only a handful had actually pulled themselves to a level ten civilization. Of those all of the herbivore classified ones had created a world government when they were either a level seven or eight civilization. Two species that had managed to become interplanetary species on their own that weren’t strictly herbivores, had done it after becoming either a level nine or ten. 

So it was expected that herbivores just tended to create world governments earlier than others. But in all cases, there was always one culture or peoples that became dominant. With the Drakken it was the Kivan. With the Dalong it was the Gindalo, and so on and so forth. 

These cultures, either through power, values, stubbornness, or straight up ruthlessness managed to unify their species.

Earth had a few candidates who had the potential to gain the title of Unifier. 

The Russian Federation, despite some setbacks, was still in the running, but to truly become a unifier would need to stop being as antagonistic and belligerent to its neighbours. Or, if they wanted to go for military domination, restructure their economy and military to be more efficient and an aspirarational career.

The nation of China had potential, but the notes for that nation stated that it had similar problems with antagonism and belligerence with its neighbors as the Russian Federation. As well the nation itself had a tendency towards instability in the past. Based on previous patterns and how tenuous the country’s economy, social structures, and population were holding together, it was overdue for another collapse. All they had to do was not fall apart within the next century and they might actually be a strong contender.

The European Union was a candidate, but it was a multi-national organization with competing cultures and values, and appeared to be more like several large Janic birds vying for power while several smaller ones nipped at their tails. Which to Oltuck just told him that it was going to fall apart. They either needed to unify under one identity or perish. 

One that Oltuck had found surprising was a group known as the Islamic States. He was surprised by this one as they were a multinational group who were not united and had tenuous alliances at best. His initial reading of the group made him believe that they were not organized enough to even be considered a candidate, until he read that they were primarily a religious organization. Which was worrying, especially with the research team's assessment that they were a highly motivated group due to their beliefs, and seemed to inspire militant action from its faith. This wasn't unique in itself, but the research team's analysis was that in its current state it wouldn't be able to coexist with the rest of the galaxy. The only thing that was stopping them was that they were disorganized and divided. 

One that Oltuck didn’t agree with as a potential candidate was the nation of India. It had a hefty amount of the planet's population, and boasted a large technology development arm. But the standard of living within the nation made his security-based mind shake his head. The places that had the fewest internal security issues or threats were also the places with the highest standards of living. He presumed that the reason for the inclusion was due to their culture having similar aspects to the Dalong, specifically the caste system. Oltuck had already figured out that humans were a very divided people, and a caste system might work for the Dalong, but the system did not work for humans.

Another multi-national organization known as the United Nations had been mentioned a couple of times in the reports, and when Oltuck had asked about it he had been told that it was less a governing body and more a forum for the nations to air grievances with one another. And the small amount of military capabilities they did have had to be provided voluntarily by member nations. Which seemed like such a waste of potential clean unification.

But the entry he was reading now was about a group known as *‘the United States of America’.*

At first, reading through the reports, Oltuck had thought this was another issue of a multi-culture group trying to unify. Until he read further and realized that these desperate cultures all had a through line, a touch stone of cultural unification in the form of a document that laid out the rights and freedoms of the citizens of the nation. He found that fascinating.

Despite most of the other nations of this world disliking the USA to some degree, even those who were part of an alliance known as NATO with the USA, it maintained a high status as a relatively trustworthy power, even if not always a peaceful one. With many allies and strong trade agreements, it seemed to have maintained a steady influence on the world stage for two hundred years.

The report said it was the most likely to become Unifier, and if not, then its culture would be the main influence for whoever took its place. Especially as it had already influenced multiple other nations into adopting at least some of its culture by proxy.

It was due to this proxy relationship that had allowed it to take control of the ship that was now jumping around the system. 

According to the research team, the USA’s biggest weakness was currently itself. Social division, political lethargy and mild corruption, and from what was gathered, a bizarre sense of self loathing. The research team noted that this was partially due to the social divides, as plenty within the nation seemed to find such rhetoric anathema to the very soul of the nation. Alnure had also informed Oltuck that he should trust nothing on the information network the humans had constructed as much of it was either deliberate misinformation or highly misinformed, which was the one reason they still sent drones to the planet on occasion to confirm any widespread claims of something. 

Even so, as Oltuck read on he couldn’t help but feel like he was onto something important but he couldn't put a claw on exactly what it was.

Doctor Jessica McFadden glided down the hall as she looked for the new Situation Advisor. 

Jessica was the Prometheus’s anthropologist, with degrees in archeology, sociocultural anthropology, biological anthropology, and - what had gotten her on this mission - Xenoanthropology. 

Xenoanthropology was mostly theoretical, using earth cultures and people as stand ins. But apparently her thesis on the topic had caught the eye of someone important. And so she had been brought aboard to help collect data and catalogue any cultures they found. If they found any.

She tried to hide her discomfort as she passed a sailor who moved to one side of the hall and saluted. She wasn't certain what to do so opted for a polite barely perceptible nod. She hated that. Not the sailor. He was just doing what he had been instructed to do. No, what she hated was what it represented. She had pity for individual military personnel in a way. Most probably wouldn't have chosen this life if they had been given the choice of anything better. But the socioeconomic system they lived under meant that many had chosen this out of survival, not choice. That they had been tricked with honeyed words and false promises of benefits and privileges into this. To her it was simply just another form of coercion. If the government put even a fraction of the money they spent on the military industrial complex into the education system instead, then most of the people here wouldn't be. 

But of course if they did that then who would they trick into fighting and enforcing the regimes, endless wars, and expansionist agenda. Educated people, after all, were not as easily fooled into such traps. 

Jessica knew she had been privileged by the simple fact that she hadn't needed to sell herself to get the education she wanted.

When she had been told about the project she had been both shocked and appalled. She'd almost refused when she had heard it was a military operation. She hated that part the most. She didn't like NASA much either but at least they would have made the thing into a science vessel instead of a weapon of war. 

She wasn't surprised by the outcome, she was just highly disappointed. She could only imagine what the original creators of the alien vessel would think if they saw what humanity was doing to it. 

It was probably a lot like watching a child play with a kitchen knife and seeing them try to stab someone with it. She just couldn't think of any better analogy for it, humanity was just not ready to go to the stars. Not because humans didn't want to, or couldn't, but because humanity just hadn't matured yet. Still fighting over resources, still waging war and harming the earth. 

She knew this. Knew that if humanity went to the stars now, they would do what they always did, and that would be to expand and exploit, it would just be another chapter in the long history of colonialism and destruction.

Which was why she had ultimately chosen to join the mission. Jessica had been convinced by the mission’s politician, Ambassador Dullard. He had said to her, “*We need people like you. People who are forward thinking. Those who understand that we need more peace and less war. Critical thinkers, educated people. Not just the warmongers who can't see anything that isn't in the sights of a gun*.”

That had been what had truly convinced her to accept the offer to join on. If it wasn’t her, then who? Would they go down the list of the next best option, or would they find someone like her old professor of archeology, a person who believed that the British museum did nothing wrong by refusing to return cultural artifacts to their rightful origins? 

Would they try to find someone qualified or somebody who was more agreeable to their systems?

She wanted to believe they would look for someone just as qualified but she also knew deep in her soul that wasn't how the system worked. So she had made her decision. Jessica knew that this was an opportunity to not just make a difference, but to shape how future generations of humans would ultimately explore the galaxy. It would be a difficult thing to do, she knew that. Not just because she was only one voice among many, but also because, as her father had been fond of saying, ‘the squeaky wheel gets the grease'. 

She couldn't rock the boat too much lest she be replaced by someone more agreeable. But if she was going to succeed in her personal mission she needed to know who her allies were. 

Which was why she was moving down the halls looking for the new Situation Advisor. She had heard Liam had broken his leg. Her feelings on hearing that news had been overwhelmingly neutral. While she didn't wish ill on the man she and Liam hadn't exactly gotten along either. 

He seemed to find pleasure in pissing her off, turning everything she said into a challenge or flatly refusing to accept that he was wrong. She had found him the most infuriating person on the civilian side to work with. She had compared him to some of her more vindictive conservative professors and teachers who were stuck in old ways of thinking and refused to even consider they were wrong. 

At least with her professors they had been formally educated and knew how to have a debate. Liam? Liam was no different then some internet troll who thought that reading a Wikipedia article made them an expert on a subject. 

So, yes, hearing he'd broken his leg and wouldn't be on the mission hadn't exactly been terrible news to her. She had figured at first that they would either continue the mission without him or cancel until he was healed. She hadn't considered the third option until she had heard that they'd brought in a new Situation Advisor. 

All she knew about them was that they were from Canada, appeared young, and they were named Percy. Others had said the new advisor seemed incredibly smart. But she hadn’t gotten a chance to talk to them herself yet.

The fact they were Canadian was promising though. She didn't want to stereotype, but the nation's populace was known for being polite and helpful and every person she had ever met from the country had been intelligent and liberal minded with similar beliefs as her own. She knew that statistically not everyone from that country was going to be like that, but she gave it better than fifty-fifty odds. 

Besides, so long as they weren't some war mongering brute like Liam was they couldn't be any worse. 

Now all she had to do was find them.



\------



The term ‘no good deed goes unpunished’ was coming to mind. Axel Fletcher was trying to figure out which god he'd pissed off.

The kid - Fletcher still couldn't see Percy as much else - was being given a rifle. And while he was fine with that, he also knew how a lot of civilians who'd never touched a gun before acted when they got one. And the kid being from Canada… Well, it was safe to say that Fletcher's expectations were low.

Fletcher had been informed that everyone, including the science team and civilian detachment had been trained in the use of small arms. 

Fletcher had no idea why. He was happy that the civilian element would at least be able to handle a gun if they were handed one. But if the situation was bad enough they had to be handed one, then the mission was royally screwed. 

Normally, however, the job of training a civilian in the use of weaponry was handled by an officer or at minimum an NCO. Private Fletcher was neither.

It didn't help that the kid seemed to always have this stupid smile on his face, like he was the hottest shit in town. Fletcher just wanted to punch it. 

The First Sergeant had been the one to draw the rifle meant for the kid and Fletcher, and most of the platoon had found that amusing. 

For the most part, the crew of the Prometheus and the civilian element had been handed the P90 PDW. 

Fletcher was guessing that it had been chosen by the space force. Especially with one of their bases being the newly reactivated Cheyenne mountain. 

But the kid was being trained on the same weapons as the Marines and Fletcher couldn't help but wonder why. 

He guessed it might have been because the rifle was easier to learn, but he doubted that. Either way, Fletcher was the one who had to teach the kid how to use it. 

Which was why Fletcher was walking up to the firing range carrying two battle rifles. The firing range was a simple thing. The line was just a long bench, about a foot in width and twenty feet long, at waist height. Beyond the line was about a hundred yards in length with hesco barriers set up on either side and at the very end. There was a pulley system for paper targets to be wheeled out, as well there were four metal dummy targets lined up at the fifty yard mark and then four more lined up at the very end of the range. Each had hundreds of little dents in them and chipping metal. 

Fletcher laid the rifle down on the bench and the civvy looked at it with that big stupid grin.

“That is-” Fletcher started and was horrified as the kid just picked up the gun.

“The Heckler and Koch four seventeen. This one looks like a thirteen inch barrel. Red dot sight and suppressor. Gas piston operated. And if the giggle switch is installed it can fire six hundred rounds a minute.” The kid said, looking at the gun. 

Fletcher grabbed the gun by the foregrip and yanked it away from the kid. And then glared at the civvy.

Fletcher might have been pissed, but multiple things ran through his head as he glared at the kid. The first was that the kid had pronounced the name Koch like the drink. The second that despite having just picked up the gun, had followed all safety procedures. Finger off the trigger, weapon pointed down range and away from anyone. And finally that the kid had properly identified the gun and key characteristics. 

“Yes. Sir.” Fletcher said with gritted teeth.  “It is. I would ask that you do not touch it until you are given permission.” The private said. 

“Oh, right, sorry.” The kid said with pursed lips and a sheepish face. Fletcher kept a straight face and gave him a look and then slowly placed the gun back down on the bench. He took out some magazines from the bag he’d been carrying and placed them next to the gun. 

All the while he could hear the other platoon members preparing themselves. He also knew that they were watching trying to see if the kid would fuck up and shoot himself in the foot. 

Fletcher went over the gun. Running through all the things he'd also been taught when he'd been in boot, including safety measures. Then - because the First Sergeant had ordered it - set up a paper target on the pulley system. He took the target to the twenty-five yard mark. Just because the kid could identify the gun didn't mean he could shoot for shit. 

“Alright.” Fletcher said. He considered the kid for a second and the dumb goofy grin. Maybe now was the time to scare the kid. 

“Now you may pick up the rifle and repeat after me.” Fletcher smiled inwardly as the kid grabbed the rifle. Once the civvy was facing him with a rifle held in a port arms position, Fletcher started.

“This is my rifle. There are many like it, but this one is mine.” The Private said looking at the civvy with an expression of slight disdain. The kid’s grin never faded.

“This is my rifle. There are many like it, but this one is mine.” The kid said nearly with glee.

“My rifle is my best friend. My rifle is my Life. I must master it as I must master my life.” Fletcher said and the kid repeated the line without hesitation. 

“My rifle, without me, is useless. Without my rifle, I am useless. I must fire my rifle true. I must shoot straighter than my enemy who is trying to kill me. I must shoot him before he shoots me. I will.” Fletcher watched as the kid repeated it without hesitation, almost starting before Fletcher was even finished. 

“My rifle and myself know that what counts in war is not the rounds we fire, the noise of our burst, nor the smoke we make. We know that it is the hits that count. We will hit.” Fletcher quoted and the kid’s grin was almost predatory as he repeated the line as if he…

“My rifle is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its parts, its accessories, its sights and its barrel. I will ever guard it against the ravages of weather and damage as I will ever guard my legs, my arms, my eyes and my heart against damage. I will keep my rifle clean and ready. We will become part of each other. We will.” Fletcher said and this time the kid did start repeating before he had finished.

“My rifle is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a lover. I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its parts, its accessories, its sights and its barrel. I will ever guard it against the ravages of weather and damage as I will ever guard my legs, my arms, my eyes and my heart against damage. I will keep my rifle clean and ready. We will become part of each other. We will.” The kid said. There was a pause as both of them locked eyes and the civvy realized he hadn't repeated the line word for word. Fletcher was about to have him repeat it correctly when Top stepped next to him. The Private came to attention but the bigger man just looked at him and motioned with a slight head flick towards the kid.

“Continue.” was the only thing the big First Sergeant said. Fletcher nodded.

“Before God, I swear this creed. My rifle and myself are the defenders of my country. We are the masters of our enemy. We are the saviors of my life.” Fletcher said.

“Before the Gods, I swear this creed. My rifle and myself are the defenders of the people. We are the masters of our enemy. We are the saviours of my life.” The kid said this time again the thing was not word for word.

“So be it, until victory is America’s and there is no enemy, but peace!!” Fletcher nearly shouted emphatically. The kid looked slightly confused and then repeated the line word for word. 

Top looked at the kid for a second before he spoke.

“Whats the version of this you know?” He asked. The civvy paused as if uncertain what to say and then spoke with a little less confidence then he’d had when reciting the creed. 

“The one I know ends with ‘So be it, until victory is achieved and there is no enemy, but peace.” the civvy said. The First Sergeant looked at the kid with some thought before giving a slight nod.

“Where’d you learn it?” Top asked, the tone wasn’t hushed, but it had a softness to it that was laced with command. The kid seemed to consider for a second.

“My dad.” the civvy said nervously. The First Sergeant gave the kid a look that told him to continue. 

“When I was younger we’d go out shooting at least once a week together. I wasn't allowed to shoot until I could recite the whole thing from memory. I guess ‘cause we weren’t christians nor Americans he kinda changed it to be more… inclusive.” the kid smiled with pursed lips that faded. Top nodded.

“The exact wording of the creed, while sacred, is not as important as what it represents. The change is hollow unless you understand what it means. Do you understand what it means, boy?” the First Sergeant asked. This time the kid blinked and the wisp of a smile came to his face.

“Sir. In a battle if I must be able to fight my enemies, near hits are just second chances for the enemy, and giving second chances to an enemy is not just foolish but could be deadly. Letting the gun spray may be fun and terrifying for the enemy but it doesn’t mean anything if the enemy can keep fighting. In order for me to achieve victory in battle, I must be able to hit my enemy and to do so I must become one with my weapon. We are not just man and machine, this is a partnership and as such I must uphold my end of this union so she may uphold hers. It is my job to keep her clean, to keep her functioning and to always fix her problems. If I can do that she will be able to serve me as I need her. And so long as there are enemies who still draw breath then neither me nor her shall know peace.” The kid said confidently. 

The First Sergeant looked at the kid for a moment, seeming to judge his sincerity. Then nodded.

“Sounds like your father knew what he was talking about.” Top said. 

“He also used it as an analogy for marriage. Trust me, that was an awkward conversation. I have never seen a grown man so uncomfortable with trying to explain that, as a father, he'd be accepting if his son was gay. Which, along with my sister also going along on those shooting trips, is why we used the term *lover*.” Percy shrugged the big goofy grin back on his stupid face. Top snorted humor, his expression unchanged.    

The First Sergeant gave a happy nod. Turned to Fletcher and gave the private a nod. 

“Carry on.” He said before walking off.  



\------



Lieutenant Colonel Allen ‘Scorch’ Moor was a striking man. Handsome, well built, broad shoulders, hazel eyes and a winning smile. He hadn't been certain about his role when he'd been given it. He was prior Navy before joining the space force, a Carrier Flyboy. He had spent nearly two thousand hours with a jet engine strapped to his ass, had a degree in both Mathematics and Computer Science and had been eyeing NASA’s astronaut program. 

So when he was asked to join this mission he’d been excited, then when he’d been given his job he'd become more than a little apprehensive. He had never considered a stint in the marines. Thought they were a bunch of dirty ground pounders. Why he’d been selected to take the platoon was a mystery to him. Though his running theory was that the navy thought it was funny to put the former flyboy with the ground pounders. To be honest he suspected that there was actually a good reason, but he thought him and Vera should have switched places. Especially considering he was prior Navy before being a Spacie. 

Then again he’d come to like his little band of Marines, or was it school of marines? They weren't completely water bound. And the corp did have its own air wing. Maybe Gaggle then? Like ducks.

Either way he found them enduring. They were strange as all hell, and some of their customs and traditions scared the ever living shit out of him, but he liked them all the same. Normally a Platoon of marines would be commanded by a Second Lieutenant or maybe even a first Lieutenant. But the mission was considered important enough to put a Lieutenant Colonel in charge of one. It was an odd choice but he also figured the reason had to do with what it symbolized rather than anything else.

He was taking a sip of coffee when Commander Roman stepped into the platoon's office. 

Both had been in the Space Force before joining the operation, and while her rank had changed for the continuity, his had not. 

“Hey, Mimi.” He said casually, looking over at her from his position near the window. It overlooked the training ground and he had been casually watching the marine platoon at the target range off on the far end. 

“Have you met the new sit-ad?” She asked, sternly. She was always all business. He sighed. The chip on this woman's shoulder because she thought that the military was a man's domain was exhausting. 

Then again he'd seen the women who didn't take it as seriously and knew how it could turn out, so it could be worse.

“Kinda sorta.” He said shrugging, taking another sip of his coffee. 

“Can you please take this seriously?” She asked. He sighed to himself and looked at her. 

“We were introduced. But I have not personally gotten to know the kid.” He said. Mimi looked confused. 

“Why does everyone keep calling him kid?” She muttered. 

“Have *‘you’* met him yet?” Scorch asked quizzically. The woman froze for half a second. 

“No. I haven't.” She said, and the Lieutenant Colonel nodded with a smile. 

“Figured.” He said then frowned. “So what is this about?” He asked. Mimi sighed. 

“Are you really alright with this?” She asked. Scorch Shrugged.

“Navy Op, Navy choice.” He said without any inflection one way or the other. 

“And you're okay with that?” The commander looked at him with a face that was a cross between scandalized and incredulous. 

“Mimi. The Airforce used to be a branch of the army, until people realized the logistics and tactics for planes were vastly different and what showed them that was experience. The Space Force needs experience. We were pulled out of nothing and we currently have zero idea how to handle anything like this, hell the Navy only barely has experience handling something like this.” he said. Mimi looked at him confused. 

 Scorch nodded looking back out the window. 

“This will be the first true exploratory ship in over a century.” He said. 

“What?” Mimi asked, still confused and the Lieutenant Colonel turned to her with a smile. 

“The age of exploration?” He said with a raised eyebrow. 

The Commander looked at him with pursed lips and shook her head in confusion.

His smile faded and he pursed his lips. 

“How much of history do you know?” He asked cautiously. 

“I know what the age of exploration is, I'm just not sure what you're getting at.” She said with a slight exasperation. 

He nodded.

“The age of exploration is something of a misnomer. The reality is that the edges of the maps were always known, mostly by merchants. And the stories they told of those edges were always filled with wonder and amazement.” He said waving his coffee mug as he gestured around. 

“So scholars used to mark those edges with such things as *‘here be dragons’*.” Scorch smiled at Mimi’s confused face, waiting for him to get to the point. His smile faded slightly and he turned to the window as he spoke.

“The age of exploration was when we went exploring for the sake of it, not just to make a dollar. We made dollars on some endeavors but that was after, and plenty of explorations failed. Those adventurous souls went out looking for the dragons at the edges of the maps because they wanted to know for certain. The thing is, they weren't going out there completely blind. Those merchants, they were still around and kicking. They still had an idea of what might be out there.” he said, turning back to Mimi.

“It has been more than a hundred years since the last exploration ship set sail. And anyone who might have experience with how dangerous travel through the unknown could be, are long dead and gone. The only place where we've slayed dragons in the meantime is between the pages of a book.” He gestured in the general direction of the shooting range.

“That boy is the closest thing we have to one of those merchants.” Scorch smiled. The Commander looked unimpressed. 

“If I remember correctly. A lot of those merchants told those stories to justify the ludicrous price of foreign goods.” She said calmly and without a trace of humor. Scorch nodded. 

“That is true. Cinnamon stick collection and giant ants come to mind. But, some of their stories were true. Like gorillas and rhinos. Even the questing beast was a giraffe.” He said with a nod.  

“But the reality we face is that we have the eggheads to tell us all of the stuff we might run into. But, like the rest of us, they're here to explore as much as we are. That boy is on this Op to be the person who already has an idea and can warn us.” He said, giving Mimi a very serious look. 

“Except he doesn’t know anything more than those eggheads.” she said, with a blank expression.

“Not true. The men who went with Christopher Columbus had zero idea of what they'd run into. But they went because they had experience dealing with the unknown.” Scorch smiled back. 

“And you think he has experience dealing with the… Dragons, in the unknown?” Mimi asked.

“More experience than the egg heads.” the Lieutenant Colonel said.

“That sounds like wishful thinking.” The Commander said. Scorch shrugged.

“Better to go with than without.” He responded. Mimi sighed deeply.

“So. You think that we couldn't do this mission without someone like him?” She asked with raised eyebrows, still unimpressed. Scorch snorted humor. 

“No. I'm almost certain we could manage without him. But I also think we will have a harder time of it if we don't have him or someone like him.” He said. 

“Why? What’s the actual difference?” The Commander asked. Scorch took a sip of his coffee and shrugged. 

“Astrophysics tells us about the shoals and reefs, and what mountain passes are safe, and even where the dragon ‘*might’* be. Geology tells us about the environment of the dragon. The linguist helps us communicate with locals to figure out where the dragon is. And Bio is along to actually study the dragon.” He said and smiled. “The kid? Well he's there to tell us if a dragon even exists.” He said. 

Mimi looked out the window with a stern face. 

“You thought about this a lot it seems.” she said. Scorch shrugged. 

“I got to talk to Liam about this whole thing more than you did. And it's a similar argument he made. I've just added my own points to it.” he said. “Which I think you should do. Go talk to the kid that is. You might warm up to him.” He gave her a smile and sipped his coffee.

Mimi stared for a long moment before she sighed. 

“What happens if we actually do run into a dragon? And I'm not talking necessarily metaphorically. What if we actually come across a giant lizard that breathes fire?” She asked. The Lieutenant Colonel gave the woman a smile and chuckled as he spoke.

“Oh, why commander. That's what my little platoon of Marines are for.”

**Authors Notes**

I wanted to address something that I hope will put context to this story. This story was originally meant to be a novel that took tropes of scifi and actually look at what they were and address how they would actually work out. 

This is also, yes this is becoming a once every two weeks series because I have a lovely editor now. And I would like the time for any rewrites like I had to do with this chapter because originally Jessica was more caricature than character and frankly I didn't like it. 

If you liked the story please leave a comment, it helps with motivation. Even if its mean, it will fill me with spit.

It’s called “Pour Decisions” and they do Craft Beer and Craft Coffees at their San Jose location which I’ve been to a few times.

I’m not sure about their coffee and pastry offerings — they looked good, but I never tried them.

Their craft beer selection was top notch.  Easily better than the other Mountain View options.  They have some of the top California craft beers like Shred, Slice, Moonraker and the like.  In addition to the beers on tap, their San Jose location also sells cans to go.

Definitely a welcome addition to the neighborhood for craft beer fans like me.

She doesn't mention the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, probably because last year she and Tommy did a stream on Cults and Crims and their chat really got triggered when Reese and Tommy brought up the subject.   
  
She points out that the skin around her new tattoo is red, irritated and itchy.  
  
Another fan thanks Reese for wishing her happy birthday. That's one of the few things Reese does to make fans feel like she genuinely cares about them. It's extremely easy and fast to create one ""happy birthday"" message on Facebook and then personalize that one message to send to a lot of people. Facebook reminds its users every day which of their friends are celebrating birthdays. She shouts out another fan and says she's missed her for a long time and she's glad that woman is back in her chat tonight.   
  
Reese claims she's spending about six hours on Zoom every day for her other job. She used a new all-metal razor to shave her cooter today, she says, advising her audience to use less plastic. She says she still uses K cups for her coffee and that's a problem. Reese asks her chatters if they really think under-the-radar Scientologists could be watching her channel and says she rarely thinks about that.   
  
She describes in graphic terms how heavy the bleeding from her menstrual cycle gets and says that when she removes her period cup, so much blood splashes out that it reminds her of Dexter and she fantasizes about who she would kill if she were a serial killer.  
  
She tells a story about AAA and makes a big deal out of saying that she had to call AAA once because Jeff was at a Jester party on her birthday. Reese insisted this year that her birthday had never been celebrated before and that she never made a big deal about her birthday. Now she has a very clear memory of Jeff not staying in town for one of her birthdays.   
  
She's surprised when a bunch of her fans know what ""Dev T"" means. That's a Scientology term that refers to developed traffic or an annoyance. Reese says she wants to put together a list of weird Scientology words and what they mean. She really should look at some other ex-Scientologists' books because others have already done that.   
  
Reese asks H to bring in her Scientology ethics book and he says he doesn't have a shirt on. She says that's OK and he opens the office door to quickly hand her the book. He looks a little embarrassed. ""Shake that cake,"" Reese tells him. She holds up the book and says it was her Bible. She talks about the Third Party Law and says L. Ron Hubbard teaches that gossip causes all conflicts between people.   
  
She says the last bits of auditing she had in Scientology were about her 95-year-old deceased husband Fred and that her dad has been brought up in every auditing session she's ever had. The Jesters never came up in one of her auditing sessions, she says.   
  
A fan asks for fashion advice so Reese and her chat jump into giving her suggestions for an outfit to wear to a concert. Reese says that Jeff took her to see her favorite band when they came to Kansas City.   
  
Reese says about 30 people unsubscribed from her channel after yesterday's stream when she and her chat were talking about Charlie Kirk's murder. She adds that a couple of people messaged her privately and told her that her mods don't know what they're doing. Her chat immediately gets tense again and mods ask her fans to stop fighting about religion and politics.   
  
Reese says she'd love to do a jewelry stream and brags that she has so much jewelry that her fans would shit themselves if they saw it all. Jewelry is the first thing she looks for in stores, she says, adding that she can't get enough of it. There aren't enough days in the year to wear all of the jewelry she already owns, she says.   
  
Reese describes a large piece of furniture she bought in Kansas City to store and organize her jewelry. I remember her talking about buying a really expensive cabinet that she'd had her eye on for a long time, but I don't recall the details about it. She says talking about this is going to bring her a lot of hate.   
  
Reese claims she didn't take anything from her house with Jeff that she didn't buy, adding that he didn't want her to move that jewelry cabinet to Tennessee. The truth is that after Reese told her fans she wanted a fresh start and they sent her money for new home goods, she wound up moving so much stuff from the Kansas City house that the largest moving truck available wasn't big enough to move it all. She and Tommy had to rent a second truck at the last minute and she was pissed about paying for it even though her fans and her parents paid for her move.   
  
Reese asks people in the chat if they would still accept her into their lives even after she has recently talked more about her Scientology indoctrination and what happened in her childhood. She's fishing for more sympathy and for additional people who will tell her that they will be loyal to her no matter what she says or does. She repeats that the people she thought were her close friends have said things to her in the past few months that hurt her feelings and are making her re-evaluate her friendships. Reese claims she wants more friends.  
  
Reese asks her chatters if they think they need to protect their peace and not let Reese into their lives because she's had so much chaos in her life. She says she doesn't think she's full of drama and she's not gossipy. She claims that she wouldn't release any of her friends' secrets, but Reese has burned a lot of people in the past by publicizing very personal information about them or threatening some of them that she'll embarrass them publicly if they continue to reveal truths about her.   
  
The fan who has been superchatting Reese for a long time trying to get her to pay attention to a very personal email Reese promised to read spends more money in this stream to say that Reese is misunderstood by a lot of people and to tell Reese that she would 1000% have Reese as a best friend. That's exactly the kind of response Reese is looking for. Reese tells that fan she doesn't know her that well but she feels incredibly close to her. Read her email so you'll know more about her, Reese. She's already paid you multiple times to follow through with that.   
  
She gets a couple more small superchats from people saying they would love to be her friend and other messages in the chat that say the same.   
  
Reese says she wonders if she comes off as untrustworthy because of her background. When she and Tommy first broke up, she says, she went into his channel and spied on his chat. She claims some people hurt her feelings by telling him in the chat ""What did you expect? You were dating an ex-Scientologist."" Reese says it hurts because it's true and that if somebody wrongs her, she will absolutely come out swinging.   
  
She only talks to her longtime friend Michelle about once a month now because Michelle is in a new relationship and she's busy. Reese says she likes having friends who are busy, who give her unconditional love and who aren't clingy. She doesn't want any friends who warn her not to do something.  
  
Reese says she would want to have an agreement and understanding with future friends that they might outgrow each other or drift apart. ""I would want to know that that's OK too and you're not going to go crazy or do anything weird,"" she says. Reese warns her fans that she doesn't do sympathy so they shouldn't come to her when they're crying. Reese says no one consoled her as a child so she doesn't know how to console others now.   
  
That's a serious cop-out because many people have been incredibly supportive and have held Reese's hand through all kinds of emotional turmoil. She just doesn't want to give that kind of support to others. She's very one-sided about her relationships and now she's specifically warning people that if they become her friend, she will be taking a lot more from them than she gives.   
  
She claims in this stream that Tommy did take the time to learn about her and her background and she says Jeff didn't care at all. That doesn't fit with what she has said before. She has said in the past that Tommy didn't want to talk to her much unless they were on livestreams together. She says Tommy told her when they were together that her brand of crazy lights a fire and it's the missing puzzle piece to his soul. She's been making sure to mention Tommy in almost every stream she's done recently. Reese is trying to get her fans to accept him again.   
  
Reese starts talking about when H was 3 years old and he would tell her ""Don't say other words"" and ""I'm going to make you sad."" She says one day H was arguing with his dad and Michael was saying that H was going to take a nap. She claims H told his dad that he would make him sad and put him in a hot oven. She says that freaked her mom out.   
  
Reese says when H first started talking, he was angry and loud but now he's quiet and calm. ""That's what they say about serial killers, don't they?"" she says with a smile.

Michael had Reese on the phone asking her to help him get H to take a nap so she heard H tell Michael that he would put him in a hot oven, she says. When Reese got home, she told H that they weren't going to put up with threats and H told her that he would throw her out of a window, she says.   
  
Reese says he only talked like that when he was 3 years old. ""It's wild and clever but terrifying as well,"" she says, joking that any haters who are talking shit about H should think twice because she doesn't know what he's capable of doing.   
  
She talked about H taking his shoe off and throwing it at another kid after Reese took fries away from him at a Red Robin when he was 4 years old. She's joking again that she thought at that point she was raising a little serial killer.   
  
She says this stream was dog shit and a lot of people left during it.

1nev96c,https://i.redd.it/nagpsdvb8oof1.png,Blizzard is making Brigitte into Jesus.,"“AYOOO Brigitte got some really strong perks, she'll be OP in the new season.” “It looks like Brigitte will be very strong in new season.” “I'm not going to lie, Brigitte has some scary perks.”

Well, everyone who NEVER PLAYS BRIGITTE and said so is right. A hero with an 8% pick rate and a 45% win rate is super strong. Hanzo had roughly the same stats before his last buff. Buff Brigitte in the midseason patch, huh?

Blizzard themselves give ALL dive heroes crazy perks, while weakening Weaver, removing Ana's double nano, replacing Illari and Zen's good major perks with some kind of crap. 

Why should Brigitte take the heat for all supports? She was given good perks, no doubt, but only considering that they also buffed all dive heroes. As a result, you either have to take dive supports too, or play the role of a punching bag. 

Literally every game I've watched has been Brigitte getting beaten up, after which she and Ana are switched to dive heroes. Or, of course, continue to suffer. All according to the precepts of Ram.

How about giving Illari a decent escape option?

How about you stop weakening Juno? As far as I know, Juno mainers don't like almost every update.

The funniest thing. Maybe you could cancel the change Weaver's HP? What did he do to you, Blizzard?

\
Alt text: Business professionals in formal discussion, symbolizing Bahrain’s vibrant M&A ecosystem., now part of Bahrain’s evolving tax regime, impact mergers and acquisitions? I realized, then, that Bahrain’s business landscape was on the brink of a new era—one that demands expert navigation, tradition, and adaptability.\
\
Bahrain’s 2025 Business Environment: Growth, Opportunity, and Change\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting, Bahrain Bay skyline at sunset. shows Bahrain’s non-oil GDP growth at 4.2%, outpacing several GCC peers. The Financial Harbour, Diplomatic Area, and Bahrain Bay buzz with activity—new start-ups, holding companies, and multinationals expanding their footprint. According to Forbes Business, Bahrain now claims more than 11,000 newly formed companies in the first half of 2025 alone, a record driven by its pro-business reforms.\
Importantly, the government’s push towards 99% foreign ownership—see official guidelines here—has made the kingdom a magnet for cross-border M&A activity, especially in fintech, logistics, and professional services. The Economic Development Board (EDB) and MOICT continue to simplify procedures for both locals and international investors.\
Why Is Bahrain So Attractive Right Now?\
\
Zero corporate income tax for most sectors (though this is evolving).\
Streamlined company formation—see step-by-step guide.\
Regional connectivity: Proximity to Saudi Arabia and UAE, with friendlier regulatory touch.\
Modern infrastructure: Bahrain Bay, Diplomatic Area, Seef District are designed for global business.\
Flexible structures: Free zones (explained here), joint ventures, and holding companies.\
\
However, as the global tax environment matures—especially with the OECD’s Pillar Two rules—Bahrain is moving to align its tax regime, and the DMTT is the latest game-changer.\
\
What Is the Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax (DMTT)?\
The Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax is Bahrain’s response to OECD’s global minimum tax (GMT) under Pillar Two, targeting large multinational groups with global revenues over EUR 750 million. Effective from 1 January 2025, this tax ensures that qualifying multinational entities pay a minimum effective tax rate of 15%, regardless of local incentives.\
Key Features\
\
Applies to multinational groups (“MNE Groups”) with consolidated revenues above the EUR 750M threshold.\
Ensures a 15% effective tax rate in every jurisdiction, including Bahrain.\
If the group’s effective tax rate is below 15% in Bahrain, a top-up tax is charged to meet the minimum.\
\
\
“The DMTT is not just a compliance burden—it is a shift in the DNA of Bahrain’s global appeal, especially for cross-border M&A and restructuring.”\
(This insight echoed in both boardrooms and the Sijilat office queues.)\
\
\
The DMTT’s Direct Impact on M&A Transactions\
1. Deal Structuring and Valuation\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration: Team analyzing M&A deal structures. and request full historical tax and accounting records.\
- Use services like KeyLink’s accounting & bookkeeping compliance for smooth audits.\
3. Cross-Border Group Structuring\
With DMTT, international groups must coordinate Bahrain operations within their global tax footprint.\
- Holding company strategies—often used in Seef District and the Diplomatic Area—are now being rethought.\
- Hybrid and free zone models (free zone insights) still offer operational flexibility, but must be aligned with Pillar Two regulations.\
\
2025 Regulatory Update: DMTT Implementation Timeline and Compliance\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation: Auditors review regulatory changes. confirmed new reporting frameworks via Sijilat, with draft guidance published in March 2025. Timelines are tight.\
- First DMTT filings are due by 30 June 2026, covering 2025 financials.\
- Penalties for late or incorrect filings can range from BHD 2,000 to BHD 10,000—I’ve personally seen clients hit with unexpected late fees when preparing M&A closing documents.\
Pro tip: Pre-clear all regulatory queries with the Sijilat and MOICT offices in the Diplomatic Area. Early morning appointments (before 10 AM) have the shortest queues.\
2025 Practical Implications\
\
Deal timelines have stretched: Add 4-6 weeks for DMTT impact analysis and pre-closing compliance.\
Bahrain’s implementation lags slightly behind the UAE’s, but offers greater flexibility due to direct MOFNE engagement and fewer intermediary requirements—unlike Saudi Arabia’s more layered approach.\
\
\
Entity Structures, Ownership, and DMTT: Navigating the New Rules\
\
Alt text: Professional business support: Consultants guide clients through business structure..\
- Holding companies: Previously used to optimize tax, now subject to global minimum requirements.\
- Free zone entities: Still attractive for operational reasons but may not shield from DMTT if consolidated in a qualifying MNE group.\
A misconception: Only large corporates are affected. Medium-sized Bahraini firms being acquired by multinationals fall under DMTT if the parent group meets the threshold.\
Direct experience:\
An acquisition in Bahrain Bay stalled in March 2025 when the acquiring group’s auditors flagged a DMTT gap—resolved only after restructuring the post-deal entity chart and updating group transfer pricing documentation.\
For best results, choose entity structures purpose-built for your group’s DMTT position.\
\
Step-by-Step: Managing DMTT During M&A Transactions\
!(\
- Map out every Bahrain entity involved in the transaction.\
- Identify if the buyer, seller, or any related party triggers the DMTT threshold.\
- Engage with a Bahrain MOICT-accredited advisor for early DMTT calculations.\
2. Due Diligence\
\
Analyze effective tax rates for past 3 years.\
Review intercompany agreements and transfer pricing—especially important for holding structures.\
Confirm all Sijilat, LMRA, and Tamkeen registrations are current.\
Budget BHD 1,500–3,000 for specialist DMTT reviews.\
\
3. Negotiation and SPA Drafting\
\
Define DMTT exposure in warranties and indemnities.\
Adjust deal price to reflect any top-up tax liabilities.\
Schedule regular in-person meetings at Diplomatic Area offices—face-to-face negotiation often unlocks faster consensus, especially during Ramadan adjusted hours.\
\
4. Regulatory Filings and Approvals\
\
Compile all business registration and compliance documents ahead of time (registration checklist).\
File DMTT disclosures alongside standard post-acquisition filings.\
Reserve extra processing time if closing between May and August—government offices run shorter summer hours.\
\
5. Post-Deal Integration\
\
Implement group-wide accounting systems (outsourced options here) to track DMTT consolidation.\
Periodic internal audits recommended every 6 months.\
\
\
Time & Money Saving Insider Tips: The Bahrain Advantage\
\
Queuing: Early morning at Sijilat or MOICT in Diplomatic Area = shortest wait.\
Documents: Prepare all originals and a notarized set—digital submissions save hours, but always carry hard-copies (trust me, I learned this the hard way after a printer breakdown at EDB).\
Approval Timings: Ramadan hours are shorter but staff are more available for quick consultations just after Iftar.\
Office Location: Seef District and Bahrain Bay tend to process applications faster due to lower foot-traffic than Manama’s central offices.\
Networking: Building relationships through traditional coffee and majlis meetings can speed up informal approvals and get you insider tips.\
\
\
Cost Considerations: What Does DMTT Do to M&A Budgets?\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs: Business professionals reviewing tax impact.          |\
|------------------------------------|------------------------------|\
| Legal due diligence (basic)        | 1,200 – 5,000                |\
| DMTT compliance analysis           | 1,500 – 3,000                |\
| Sijilat/CR update fees             | 150 – 450                    |\
| Regulatory filing late penalty     | 2,000 – 10,000               |\
| Advisory/consultancy fees          | 2,500 – 8,000                |\
| Full company setup cost | 1,800 – 7,500                |\
But, costs can be optimized:\
\
Bundle legal, tax, and regulatory work with a single Bahrain-based provider—KeyLink offers integrated support.\
Avoid last-minute filings: Pre-schedule CR renewals and regulatory submissions.\
Leverage digital processing through Sijilat—saving on courier and notarization expenses.\
\
\
Practical Example: Overcoming a DMTT Roadblock\
During a major logistics sector acquisition, our team discovered on Day 2 of due diligence that the target’s parent group would push effective tax rates below 15%. The deal almost derailed, since the SPA hadn’t factored in top-up liabilities and the sellers wanted full price.\
Instead of scrapping negotiations, we worked with KeyLink’s compliance team and prepared a DMTT-specific adjustment clause. The workaround? We agreed on a BHD 600,000 escrow to cover potential top-up tax, split future DMTT cost, and accelerated post-completion integration to maximize group synergies.\
It worked—and now the group is doubling down on Bahrain expansion.\
\
Bahrain vs. Regional Peers: UAE & Saudi Arabia\
Compared to Dubai, Bahrain’s DMTT enforcement is more consultative—you can engage directly with regulators, and the MOFNE is surprisingly open to practical suggestions.\
Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, is more rigid; you’ll face more layers of review and less negotiation room.\
And Bahrain’s openness to near-100% foreign ownership (more here) trumps the UAE’s sectoral restrictions, especially in finance and logistics.\
\
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\
1. Does the DMTT apply to every Bahrain company?\
No. Only part of multinational groups with consolidated revenues over EUR 750m. However, if you’re a medium-sized firm being acquired by a qualifying MNE, DMTT compliance will factor into the deal. See entity guidelines.\
2. What steps can I take to minimize DMTT impact on my M&A transaction?\
Start DMTT analysis early—during target shortlisting—and structure the deal to optimize group-wide effective tax. Conduct pre-deal tax audits. Use integrated formation services to align legal and compliance timelines.\
3. How does DMTT affect free zone companies?\
Free zones in Bahrain (details here) remain attractive, but MNEs must include free zone profits in the group’s effective tax rate for DMTT calculations.\
4. What’s the typical time to close an M&A deal in Bahrain with DMTT reviews?\
Allow 8–14 weeks from heads of terms to closing—add 4–6 weeks for DMTT analysis. Early document preparation and off-peak office visits help cut lead times.\
5. Can I outsource DMTT compliance and M&A regulatory filings?\
Yes. Several firms (review options) offer turn-key support, including accounting, registration, and post-completion compliance.\
\
Bahrain’s M&A scene is at the crossroads of new tax rules and timeless tradition. With the DMTT in play, dealmakers must blend global regulatory knowledge with Bahrain’s unique business customs—from early morning Sijilat runs to late-night majlis negotiations. Get ahead by planning early, choosing the right advisors, and never skipping the coffee.\
(And if you ever find yourself sweating over missing signatures at Sijilat, remember: one extra set of notarized copies saves the day—my personal lesson learned, the hard way.)\

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

1neuylw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExAndClosetADD/comments/1neuylw/predicting_mcgis_narrative_on_charlie_kirks_death/,Predicting MCGI's Narrative on Charlie Kirk's death,"After Charlie Kirk’s death, Daniel Razon may capitalize his death to push his long-standing message:

* “Ang taltalan ay nauuwi lang sa violence”
* “Open debate is futile”
* “Gumawa ng mabuti” is the better form of debate

But is this sincere — or strategic? Razon’s emphasis on “doing good” might be less about virtue and more about attracting members’ dollars from foreign ministries to fund questionable charity projects, as their revenue streams. Despite claims of building free hospitals and building local churches, what’s growing are businesses like Area 52, Salut, KDRAC, Daniel’s coffee and resorts, and others we barely know like their mansions in Philippines and Brazil. When are they going to help the members from abroad who work two jobs just to to get by? Or do they just see them as potential money givers?

In contrast, high schooler Gregory Lyakhov sees Kirk’s death as a call to defend truth through open debate. He says:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBwNm4jsLLc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBwNm4jsLLc)

>“Charlie believed in empowering young people to speak boldly, even when it’s unpopular.”

Lyakhov’s clarity exposes Razon’s flaw: silencing debate doesn’t prevent violence — it prevents ACCOUNTABILITY.

When you shut down open discussion, you don’t stop harm — you stop people from questioning, exposing, or challenging harmful actions. Without debate, there’s no way to hold leaders accountable, no way to ask where the money goes, no way to demand transparency.

The good stuff first:

Ambience? Solid 10/10. Perfect if you just want to sit, chill, and talk. Definitely has that aesthetic vibe for pictures.

The manager was super sweet and talkative, even called me “bro” to make me feel comfortable.

Now the not-so-good:

The stairs. Whoever designed them… I tripped twice. 😭

The menu was just like every other café. Nothing unique except they push their teas and some side dishes (since it’s called “tea”logy).

Ordered a cold coffee and a burger. Both were meh, like 5/10. Honestly, you walk 10 steps to the left (Balaji Sandwich) and you’ll get way better cold coffee.

Conclusion:
If you’re looking for a cozy spot to hang out, talk, or click aesthetic pics – go for it.
If you’re going for food – hell nah.

I lost custody of my only child. Everyone in my life shunned me. I was on the news multiple times. Today, I’ve been clean almost six years. (11/8). My girlfriend and I have a hobby farm and I’m the farm livestock supervisor for a 1,400 acre animal rescue with almost 650 animals. Including tigers, chimps and all sorts of other rescues. I run the farm side. Goats, cows, horses, pigs, poultry etc. I’m responsible for 8 employees. I have a company vehicle, credit card, and phone. I make important decisions every day. 80% of what I eat comes from my three acres. I have a small market garden, raise meat rabbits, geese, game fowl, and I am creating  composite geese and goat breeds. I give my animals an amazing live. I help run a homestead co operative. We teach other homesteaders skills to improve their homesteads. I owe this all to a serious plant medicine experience. And the help of a lot of people. And waiting to find the right partner to make this life a reality. We don’t have kids and are able to devote all of our free time to our projects. I’ve lost almost 100 pounds and my girlfriend has lost 120. I was on 14 pharmaceuticals and now I’m on none. When my wife passed I was able to live and work on a performance quarter horse operation and those horses saved my life. I’m able to help a lot of people. My dad is dying of cancer and I was able to take him to his first Major League Baseball game. I’ve removed myself from social media and created a circle of amazing like minded people who I know who be here in a moments notice. I know my neighbors. The only tv I watch is rfdtv. I’m 100% devoted to this life. After I complete my agribusiness degree I am currently working on my girlfriend and I are going to sell our place, going on to manage as a couple until we are able to pay cash for some property and work our farm full time. I never dreamed of this in a million years. I grew up in the country. Worked on a dairy as a kid and on multiple horse operations. I made a lot of money in construction and was able to set up in my mid 30s. I wake up early and go to bed late. I drink more coffee and smoke more cigarettes than I should. But I’m happy.

Like sitting in a café by myself or walking through a city with no one to share it with would somehow feel empty. But when I finally did it, it was the complete opposite.

There’s something magical about waking up in a new place, grabbing your backpack, and realizing the entire day is yours. No compromises, no waiting on anyone, just you and whatever adventure you stumble into. One of my favorite memories is getting lost in a little side street in Lisbon, ending up in a bakery run by an old couple who didn’t speak a word of English — and still somehow having the sweetest conversation over coffee and pastries.

As a girl, I had all the usual fears before I went. Safety, judgment, loneliness. And yes, I had moments of nerves. But I also felt stronger than I ever expected. Solo travel taught me that being alone doesn’t mean being lonely — sometimes it’s when you’re most open to connecting with people and places in a deeper way.

- did 1 data co-op in public sector (liked it better than classes hhh)

- TA’d some easy classes

- random not-so-fine side research/projects on the engineering side, and some data stuff


Now I’m mostly thinking of applying to data-ish professional master’s (since that’s what ""everyone"" around me seems to be doing), but, should I also just try to go straight into work?? And how much effort should I put in...

Some context:

- I’m technically domestic but grew up mostly in Asia - so no family network here. Most of my friends are international, so for them a course-based master makes more sense (PR and all that). For me, not sure.

- Not really a research/PhD person (no con't academic connections + ADHD so don’t think I can sit through a PhD lol, and only a theory research master < course master in job market I think?).

- I do want to eventually go into MLE kinda jobs, so more machine learning/algorithm side of positions

- Didn’t try hard enough to land a summer co-op, so kinda got PTSD from that job search experience. A full-time job search seems even scarier.


What’s messing with me:

- Feels like a “good name” master sounds better than some random entry-level job. But if the master’s itself isn’t that great, does that actually hurt later?

- I know some ppl who went straight into work, but idk if that was from hardcore networking or sth. Should prob just coffee chat them tho.


So yeah, just curious what other domestic math/stat grads are doing right after undergrad. Masters first? Work first? Any advice or stories would help!

Criticisms and comments telling me where I'm actually at would also be appreciated, as long as they're friendly:)

1neuklh,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1neuklh/demineralisation_pain/,Demineralisation pain,"Hi there. I'm not being listened to by dentists, and they all have a different opinion.
I went to a dentist and she said i have demineralisation between most of my back teeth and put Duraphat between all my demineralised areas. 
She said the demineralisation was worse between the premolars and molars due to the bigger gap.
Prior to that visit, I had been having random irritation between my 25 and 26 (upper right between premolar and molar). I was eating a lot of chocolate at the time.
Some months after the dental visit, I had to quit coffee as I was getting pain between all my back teeth (so from between first premolar back). I was drinking a lot of orange juice at the time too.. so I quit that.
So after quitting coffee, the staining between the teeth.. which was adhering to the demineralised areas (chalky) has minimised dramatically. 
Now because dentists can't see the demineralised spots very well, I'm getting gaslit about the pain between the premolar and the molar up top. I know it's like a sensitivity from those spots having more demineralisation.. but now apparently 9/10 dentists can't see the demineralisation. I can see it with a torch at home (dark spot).. maybe they have bad light at the dentist. A crack has apparently been ruled out by cone beam CT, but I know cracks are extremely hard to diagnose.
Thing is, when I floss with Dr tungs floss (which is thicker.. I got that due to the gaps) and use the waterflosser, I get sensitivity in the spots I'm getting pain.
So because they can't see anything anymore and I'm in pain.. and it's not decayed.. I'm guessing it's just the good old .. use a sensitive toothpaste and we can't help you kind of deal?
I'm also a teeth grinder and they blamed it on that..  but I wear retainers at night and the sensitive spots aren't painful on contact or pressure.
This story is getting long. It's so complicated. 
I just want a filling put in the painful spots so I can move on with my life. Or do I wait how long for it to remineralise? Its been 9 months since I quite orange juice, coffee, and all forms of sugar. Will dentists fill painful demineralised spots? Maybe I need a dentist with a microscope.

My best friend, lets call her B (25F), was in a very serious relationship with H (19) in 2024. Everyone, including me warned her about dating this guy. He is still a kid, not mature enough to understand adult problems. Things were good between them. She did not like the fact that H and I used to talk occasionally (we were all friends before they started dating), so she shut me out for months. On November 2024, it was H's birthday and he invited me for his birthday party. She did not like it. She made me feel invisible and made sure everyone else there did that too. I left the party because it got really uncomfortable.  
Few weeks later H called me and asked if he could come over to my place to talk. He came to my place and smoked up ( I strictly do not do that stuff), he then told me that some of his friends told him that B was cheating on him, and asked me if she would ever do that. I know B very well, she is a lot of things but not a cheater. I assured him that she would never do anything like that and even if there was something she would tell him. He then began telling me that dating her wrong and he was too young for a committed relationship and that he wanted to ""explore"" before settling down for one. That left me shock. I did not want to meddle into their relationship, B already did not like me talking to him. After hanging out for a while he left.  
I called B and asked her if she cheated on him. She told me that she went to a concert with some of her friends and bumped into someone from the past and that nothing happened. I believed her. I told her to talk to H and clear things out. Fast forward to April 2025, they broke up. Apparently he broke up with her saying that he was too young for a relationship and he wanted to explore, also he cheated on her multiple times. B called me crying and having a breakdown. None of her friends wanted to be their for her, before she and H offended all of them saying all of their relationship was not as strong as theirs and B ghosted everyone for H. I was out of town, dealing with my own issues. I tried to calm her down and said all the basic things a person would say after their friend breaks up. Few weeks later she started talking about him as if nothing had ever happened. That is when she told me that they aren't back together, but it is just for the benefits. I did not say anything.   
On August 2025, we were video chatting and discussing about the classes and course work ( we are both PhD scholars.), she got a call from H's girl best friend, lets call her M (18F). So M wanted to talk her about something very serious and things related to H. B called H and asked him about what was going on, he demanded her not to answer the call or reply to any text from M. And that made B curious. She asked him whatever it is tell me, it can not be that bad. This was all happening while I was still on the video chat.  H gave up and told B that he was in a committed relationship with M. I was shocked. I could see tears in B's eyes and her trying to hold back.   
So, after H broke up B, and immediately came into a relationship with M and then cheated on M with B. How effed up that it?   
A few days later B called me and asked me to meet her at the coffee house. We hung out for a bit and then she gave a very creepy smile. I asked her what was up with her, she told me M was coming too. My first reacting was WTF, and then I asked her why? B was all like I wanted to see what kind person she and if was worth it. I got mad at her, she asked me to hang out with her so that she could meet her ex boyfriend's present girlfriend, who I am sure H cheated with on B. What was I an emotional support animal? M came. I met her, seemed like a sweet girl. I was very mad at B and I left after a while.  
Again after few days of that meet, B told me that she can not hate on a 18 year old and certainly can not be jealous of her, and I thought she was finally thinking straight. She gave me that creepy smile smile again, I asked her did she do, she almost sounded proud with she said that she is still sleeping with H. I was like WTF is wrong with you, why would you do that to another girl? Her answer to this was ""because I Love him"". I felt so disgusted at that moment that I was second guessing my friendship with her.  
H told her that he does not love M and that M is very controlling and she wouldn't let him do what he wants to do and also compared M with B saying that B never had any such restrictions for him. He told B that he wants break things off with M.  And that for some reason has given some sort of hope to B. She is very delusional to think that he will break up with M to be with her.   
I feel very bad M, she is just a kid and has no idea of what is going on and what is coming towards her. I talked to my boyfriend about it ( me, my boyfriend and B are very close friends), he was equally mad at her and asked her stop ruining lives. She did not listen. My boyfriend suggests that I should tell M everything and save her from the misery that is about to come.

It is hard because I feel those losses were in vain. Lives were lost, innocent people hurt, and yet people carry on waving flags and singing God Bless America like nothing changed. Days like 9/11, 11/11, 6/12, are hard for me because it is a poignant reminder of what I have lost. I do love America, I have my own flag at home. I bet you and I have more in common than not. 

Sorry for rambling. I am not trying to excuse my behavior. I am an adult, and I hate that I took out my emotions on you. I don't blame you if you don't want to interact with me ever again, but I would be happy to buy your coffee sometime or donate to a charity of your choice.

1neuexa,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1neuexa/the_real_reason_joe_smith_banned_coffee_and_tea/,The real reason Joe Smith banned coffee and tea in his contrived 'word of wisdom',"Just finished watching a 1 hour and 45 minute You-Tube presentation on the true history of Joseph Smith and the founding of his contrived and fraudulent religion, it's actually one of the best non-biased videos ever done, it does nothing but present facts, evidence, historically accurate information and authentic data from public records and does not mince words, it is a must-see. Here's the link to the video if anyone's interested...

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFwxjLzowI0

Anyway, in the video, there's a section that talks about the word of wisdom (about the 59:40 mark) and how it came to be and I actually learned something new from this video that I had never heard before and that is the fact that we know that Emma Smith was getting upset because of all the tobacco chewing and spitting onto the floor that she was constantly having to clean up, well, the women were socializing one night and lamenting how it would be nice if Joseph Smith had a revelation that would ban the use of tobacco but then all the men who were meeting thought it would be just as equally nice if coffee and tea were banned since the women were enjoying coffee and tea when they would socialize, and so Smith decided to ban everything to make both sides happy. 🤭😅 There just so happened to be a temperance movement going on in Nauvoo at the time where people were concerned about health and consumption of certain foods and drinks and so how convenient that the word of wisdom came during the movement as well. Smith was the ultimate opportunist, charlatan and con man, to say the least.",29,1757653155.0,exmormon,2,0.97,False
1neuewe,https://www.reddit.com/r/CleaningTips/comments/1neuewe/top_5_cleaning_challenges_for_airbnb_hosts/,Top 5 Cleaning Challenges for Airbnb Hosts,"Airbnb is now a great option to earn some extra income. But, maintaining a spotless and neat space is necessary to ensure guest loves your space and leave excellent reviews. Once your guests leave, cleaning can be a bit difficult. It requires attention to detail, speed, and consistency. Here are the top five cleaning challenges Airbnb hosts face and how to overcome them.

# 1. Tight Turnaround Times

Airbnb check-out and check-in times often leave a small window for cleaning. You may only have a few hours to get everything spotless before the next guests arrive.

# How to handle it:

1.Create a checklist: A detailed cleaning checklist helps you stay organized and ensures nothing is missed.

2. Hire professional cleaners: If you manage multiple properties or have back-to-back bookings, professional Airbnb cleaning services in Novi can help.

3. Use fast-drying products: Invest in quick-drying cleaning solutions to avoid wet floors and lingering odors.

# 2. Deep Cleaning After Long Stays

Guests who stay for extended periods may leave behind more mess than short-term visitors. Kitchens and bathrooms can accumulate grime, and furniture may need extra attention.

# How to handle it:

1. Schedule periodic deep cleans: In addition to regular turnover cleaning, plan for deep cleaning at least once a month.

2. Pay attention to hidden spots: Clean behind appliances, under beds, and inside cabinets.

3.  Use high-quality cleaning products: Stronger disinfectants help remove stubborn dirt and bacteria.

# 3. Handling Stains and Odors

Spills happen, and some guests may leave behind unpleasant smells. Wine on the carpet, coffee stains on the couch, or pet odors can be tough to remove.

# How to handle it:

1. Stock up on stain removers: Keep enzyme-based cleaners for organic stains like food and pet accidents.

2. Steam clean upholstery and carpets: Regular steam cleaning keeps furniture fresh and odor-free.

3.Use odor-neutralizing sprays: Baking soda and vinegar solutions can eliminate lingering smells.

# 4. Move-Out Cleaning for Long-Term Guests

If you rent your Airbnb for weeks or months, you may face an even bigger cleaning challenge once the guest leaves. Dirt buildup, dust, and clutter can take longer to clean.

# How to handle it:

1. Book a professional move-out cleaning in Novi: Professionals can tackle deep cleaning tasks efficiently.

2. Inspect for damages: Long-term stays may result in minor wear and tear. Fix issues before your next guest arrives.

3. Refresh everything: Wash curtains, replace air filters, and deep-clean appliances to maintain a fresh environment.

# 5. Managing Laundry and Linens

Fresh sheets and towels are a must for Airbnb guests. However, washing, drying, and folding large amounts of laundry can be overwhelming.

# How to handle it:

1. Have extra sets of linens: Rotate between two or more sets to speed up turnovers.

2. Use high-efficiency machines: If you do your laundry, invest in fast, energy-efficient appliances.

3. Consider a laundry service: Outsourcing laundry to a professional service can save time and ensure spotless linens.

# Final Thoughts 

Overall, cleaning your Airbnb should not be too tough. By following the solutions given in this blog we are sure you can see the difference. If you don't want to do it yourself, consider hiring professional [Airbnb cleaning services in Novi ](https://houzhelpers.com/vacation-rental-airbnb-cleaning/)or wherever you are to keep your it spotless and guest-ready at all times.",1,1757653152.0,CleaningTips,0,1.0,False

i mentioned it once, and she kind of laughed it off, saying something like, “well, technically we both have access to the food, so it’s still fair.” but it doesn’t feel fair when i’m living off caffeine and cereal while she’s cooking huge meals in my cookware and using up all the ingredients in a few days. i don’t want to make this a big deal, but it’s starting to mess with me. every time i look at the receipts, i feel like i’m paying for a system that benefits her way more than me.

am i being petty? or is it okay to want to switch to buying our own groceries instead of splitting everything 50/50?",96,1757653141.0,AmItheAsshole,100,0.9,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles vs. Chiba Lotte Marines: A Parlay of Feathers and Fury**

**Parse the Odds: The Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)**  
The Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles enter this matchup as the clear favorite, with implied probabilities hovering around **56-58%** to win outright (decimal odds of \~1.75-1.80 across bookmakers). Their spread line of **-1.5 runs** suggests they’re expected to win by a modest margin, while the Over/Under sits at **5.5-6.5 total runs**, with the Over priced slightly more attractively (odds \~1.74-1.83). Meanwhile, the Chiba Lotte Marines, currently the league’s lowest-ranked team, are a **46-48%** shot to pull off an upset, per their +1.5 spread line.

Key stats to note:

* Tohoku’s recent geographic ""conquest"" of all six Tohoku prefectures (a 21-year dream realized) could boost morale like a post-promotion hangover.
* Chiba’s recent **bird-infested games** (twice in three years at ZOZO Marine Stadium) might’ve left their players more spooked than a toddler in a chicken coop.

**Digest the News: Feathers, Frustration, and a President with Ambition**  
Tohoku’s president, Seino Mori, deserves a medal—or at least a better coffee budget—for sticking to his six-prefecture schedule since 2023, despite rain delays. His dedication is admirable, though one wonders if he’s secretly training the team to become Japan’s first geographically diverse baseball ambassadors.

Chiba, meanwhile, is still reeling from their **avian invasions**. In September 2025, a flock of white birds turned a game into a surreal aviary, with one poor creature getting stuck in the net like a feather duster at a disco. While the Lotte players might’ve improved their reflexes dodging birds, it’s hard to see this

It was late Friday after scrubbing a Whipple, and ngl I was wrecked. Longest week of the block and I just wanted to feel like a human again, so I drove to Dutch Bros right before closing.

I roll up in wrinkled scrubs, still smelling like chlorhexidine, and the barista’s this tattooed redhead who teases me about being a nurse. I laugh, drop my phone, crack the screen - tbh I was more nervous than I should’ve been. Not exactly the kind of girl you meet on call. Somehow I still asked, “hey, you look overworked, wanna grab a drink nearby?” She actually said yes. Ended up in some sketchy IPA-smelling bar, we made out, and she left my place just before her shift. Met up a few more times, but she was too young for me long-term, so I moved on.

The funny part? That random night got me digging into Dutch Bros as a company. I’m not a value investor, more “chase the narrative” - but their expansion outside Oregon looked legit. The whole vibe was like a cooler Starbucks. So last August I grabbed a chunk of stock + some calls, and now I’m sitting on basically a 2-bagger, up another 25% just this past month from a nice earnings surprise.

Not saying I’m Warren Buffett or anything, but honestly that coffee run might be the only good financial decision I’ve made since starting residency tbh.

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 31M and from the UK.

I didn't know how else to word the title but I'm looking for a best friend who's also kind of clingy and doesn't mind endlessly chatting away or pestering each other all day 🤭. I miss the closeness/clingyness of a relationship and I'm hoping to capture some of that in friend form with you! Something deeply connected and genuine. Live, love, laugh, toaster bath 🤗.

It would be great to meet people locally. As much as I would love to be pen pals, I'd prefer to move things offline eventually and start spending time IRL.

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. 

I'm working night shift tonight and things are a little bit quiet so I'll be around for a while to chat! Feel free to join me and throw some music recommendations my way.

A little info about me so you know I'm not just a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play video games. I'm obsessed with Satisfactory at the moment.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 6 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

- Female
- Born in November 1995
- 65-63 kilos (depende kapag busog 🙈)
- 5’0 short
- Currently living at Quezon City
- Works at an auditing firm as senior manager

I have the tendency to move away from the crowd, literally and figuratively. If I have a choice, I will not attend parties or functions. If I have a choice, I’d choose only 2 friends to travel with instead of 10 or 12. Every fiber of my being rejects the idea of watching the same mainstream movie that my neighbor watches. 

I like finding things that I can consider mine. I like gatekeeping things. I believe people ruin things. I hate that people discovered Money Heist and Lucifer during the pandemic because I think the showrunners made them about the fans instead of sticking to the story. And so I stopped watching the later seasons.

I love About Time and Past Lives. They tell love and romance uniquely. I love rom-coms. I love coming-of-age films. I love Edge of Seventeen as much as The Perks of Being a Wallflower. I love reading John Grisham novels, and after finishing The Street Lawyer it solidified my goal to build a life that is simple and meaningful. I love stumbling into good music when I watch films. My most recent find is Strip Me by Natasha Bedingfield. It feels like it is my discovery, something I can call mine. I loved it when I heard Mystery of Love by Sufjan Stevens in the film Call Me By Your Name. To Leave Something Behind by Sean Rowe is from The Accountant, IIRC.

I love eating the same food for a whole month even though I know I’ll get sick of it after all the cravings. That’s what happened with tuna sandwiches, Yabu, samgyup, and many more. I can’t drink coffee continuously every day because at some point (maybe after day 3 or 4) it will mess up my sleep schedule.

I have short temper when it comes to weaponized incompetence. Alam mo ‘yung inulit-ulit mo na ‘yung instructions pero nagkamali pa rin? I hate when that happens. And I hate the version of myself who hates that too. I hate the version of myself that has short temper. Why can’t I be as graceful and patient as other person?

I love talking with people about things they love. I love listening to people talk about their crafts. I love the process of discovering one’s personality—what ticks them off, what makes them smile, and what makes them furious.

I love when people make me feel seen and loved without me asking for it.

Anyway, I am rambling now. These are the things I love, which means the opposites are things I refuse to do or try.

UPDATE 3.,"Context: [https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nahj5n/remember\_those\_creepy\_chain\_emails\_from\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nahj5n/remember_those_creepy_chain_emails_from_the/)

Right now every passing second kind of feels like a slow march towards doom.

I’ve been talking to a lot of psychiatrists who try and calm me down, lead me away from bad thoughts. It’s clear that they’re choosing their words carefully but that they still can’t figure out exactly what to say to me.

I’ve asked for some coffee, but that request was shut down. Caffeine right now would lead to an earlier crash, they tell me. And they needed me to stay awake for as long as possible as they tried to figure something out.

So now I’m sitting in an interrogation room while a couple of detectives watch me, make sure I don’t doze off. They’ve given me some food that’s supposedly good for staving away drowsiness. Oatmeal, eggs, mixed nuts, some fruit. A lot of water.

I still feel pretty alert, but the day’s really only started. The longest I’ve ever gone without sleep was about twenty-eight hours. I’m not sure how long I can push that to.

Every now and then they’ll give me an update about what’s going on.

They sent a drone into the motel washroom, flying it up near the open showerhead. The feed showed that the woman was still in there. Well, all they could see was her head. It was just crammed inside, her features compressed to fit into the tight space.

Still nothing about Jackson or Elisa.

But now they’re telling me that they’ve found somebody who might know what to do. A “specialist”, they’re calling him. He’s already on his way over. They’ve framed this as good news, though it’s hard to get my hopes up.

I’ll update once I find out what’s going on with this.

So the specialist arrived a few hours ago. His name is Luke. He used to be a computer science professor. Now he holds some vague position at DARPA. He tried explaining to me exactly what he does, but most of it kind of went into one ear and out the other.

But I managed to retain the important parts.

Ever since grad school, he’s been doing some deep digging into an incredibly obscure topic.

Viruses. But not the biological kind. Not malware either.

He says that over the years, he’s noticed eerie parallels between how viruses manage to proliferate themselves through any given system and the mechanisms behind real world phenomena. Social influence, mass hysteria, dictatorships, genocide, war. The very concept of fear.

I asked him if he was implying that the world was a simulation. That our existence was the product of some kind of extradimensional coding.

He told me that in a very broad sense, yes. But that he doesn’t claim to understand the layers involved. That he’s not sure we’re capable of understanding them at all.

Of course this was the kind of research that most respected institutions wouldn’t touch with a thousand foot pole. So the vast majority of it was done independently. Funded through his own 401K and a line of credit.

The only platform that had been available for him to publish his findings on was his own website. And for decades, they’d just sat there, collecting digital dust. The few reactions they did get were nothing more than derision from fellow academics. He was mocked. Chastised.

But these things didn’t do much to deter him. He just kept doing his research, kept publishing whatever he’d found.

Then one day he arrived at a breakthrough. He found something definitive to focus on.

The paranormal.

Not just haunted houses or strange creatures in the woods. But the things that can’t be explained by the rules that we’ve set in place. The things that break our understanding of the world.

I asked him to give me an example.

He told me about the cabin in the woods. Not an actual, physical cabin. It was more akin to a predatory entity. A trap that would only present itself to those desperate enough to take the bait.

He went on to say how it’s not an uncommon thing for people to get lost in the woods. Hikers, backpackers, those running away from something. The woods are vast, foreboding. Hiding a bunch of secrets.

He told me to imagine that I’d been lost for days. Thirsty, starving, hopeless. Delirious enough that I don’t question why somebody would build a cabin so far out in the middle of nowhere. Why it looks so new and maintained. I stumble up to it and knock on the door, but nobody answers. Then I try the handle and find it unlocked and I go inside.

There’s running water, fresh food in the fridge. But nobody around. Again, I don’t question this. I’m just so relieved that the world’s finally tossed me a bone.

I then go upstairs and find a fresh bed waiting for me. I’m so weak, so tired. My legs desperately need a reprieve. I just need to recharge. A quick nap and I’ll have enough energy to keep going. So I crawl into bed.

However long later, I wake up in darkness and assume it’s nighttime. But there’s something wrong. Because my eyes aren’t adjusting to it. Then I realize it’s because the darkness is absolute. There’s no moonlight streaming in from the windows.

I get out of bed and try maneuvering around the room. The air feels thick, damp. There’s a heavy scent of Earth and metal all around. Eventually I find the light switch but it’s not working. So I take out my crumpled box of matches and use them to navigate downstairs and out the front door.

And then I realize that I’m no longer in a forest. The grassy floor has been replaced by rough stone. I see nothing but darkness in all directions. There’s a dripping noise coming from some undefined distance away. I’m in a cave.

How I got here, I can’t begin to comprehend. I panic and start running. But I have no light and nowhere to go. Only a few matches left. I decide to go back into the cabin while I come up with another plan. It’ll be safer there.

Once inside, I light another match. Just to get a sense of the layout. But it illuminates more than I’d anticipated. Something I hadn’t noticed before.

People. Standing all around me in the dark. Not moving, not speaking. Just watching. They look normal enough, but the context makes their presence frightening. Sinister.

Then one of them starts moving towards me.

The cabin is a virus. Something that doesn’t belong in our reality. A corrupted space that we have no answers for.

Nobody knows who or what put it here. How it even works. Just that it was meant to disturb the order of things. To slowly break us down. It’d be fair to call it evil in nature.

The woman was a virus as well. Our reality was the system she’d infected. Like malware, she spreads digitally. But unlike malware, she’s unrestricted. Sentient beyond our understanding of the word. She has more control over our own reality than we do. That’s why the cops couldn’t move her. We’re bound by the rules of the universe. She breaks them.

I had to ask Luke to leave me alone for a while. It was too much to hear at once. Too much to take in.

But already I could feel the fatigue coming on. I hadn’t been sleeping well even before all this. We were pressed for time. If he had a solution, then I needed to hear it now.

I called him back in and asked him if he had a plan.

He told me that he did. So then I asked how much confidence he had in it.

He said he was more confident than not. That on a scale from one to ten, he was feeling about a six.

It wasn’t really what I wanted to hear, and I guess he could sense as much, because he told me that he was just trying to be as honest as possible.

I took a deep breath, told him to go ahead and tell me what he had in mind.

He asked me if I was familiar with honeypots. In a cybersecurity context.

I told him that I might’ve read an article about it once. But that he should probably fill in the blanks.

He told me that in the simplest of terms, they were traps meant to lure in hackers. Something that seems real. Something worth invading. But ultimately nothing but smoke and mirrors. An isolated, heavily monitored system.

He asked me to imagine that I was a thief roaming around a neighbourhood for somewhere to rob. Then I spot a large, expensive-looking house with all of its lights off. I sneak into the backyard and find the back door unlocked. And then I enter.

But I’ve been baited. There’s nothing to steal in there and all of the doors suddenly lock from the outside. I’ve now been trapped.

I told him that I wasn’t really following.

He looked at the floor for a moment before saying that the cabin itself was the honeypot.

The woman was likely meticulously designed to infect our reality. In other words, she can only operate within the parameters that our world is bound by. The cabin is not bound by such rules. It’s as much of an aberration as herself. And what happens when two aberrations are forced to interact?

He said he couldn’t be entirely sure. Though he could make some reasonable assumptions, the most important one being that they would interfere with each other. What kind of interference that would be remained to be seen. Best case scenario, they would just completely shut each other down. He didn’t talk about the worst case.

Then he said that he had to a retract an earlier statement. The cabin wasn’t exactly a honeypot. Not based on the strict definition of the word. Because we didn’t actually need to lure the woman in there. We had the means to simply make her appear.

And now I understood where he was going with this.

The plan was for us travel to the cabin. We’d go inside and then I’d fall asleep. The woman would spawn in, but she wouldn’t be able to operate in there. Wouldn’t be able to leave either. Then they’d wake me up and we’d go back to the surface while she remained trapped there forever. No more emails, no more phone calls. The nightmare would be over.

At least, that’s how Luke was trying to sell it to me. And I really wanted to believe him.

I asked him how we were supposed to get to the cabin if it only appears to those who’ve been lost in the woods for days. He said we didn’t need to hunt it down. Because years ago, somebody had managed to escape the place, navigating the dark caves for nearly two whole days before he’d made it back to the surface. They found him a few miles away from a public campsite, in a state comparable to catatonia. Breathing but unresponsive, his expression fixed in a thousand-yard stare. But over time, he was able to come back to reality. Within a few weeks, he was completely coherent again.

And he was able to give a shockingly accurate account of where exactly the cabin was. Not just the location of the cave, but exactly how you needed to navigate inside in order to get there.

Which he told me shouldn’t have been possible. Because the guy claimed to have been in pitch darkness the entire time. They had no answer for this, but it didn’t really matter.

I asked him how far down into the cave we’d need to go. He told me not far. Just over two hundred feet in vertical depth.

I just nodded. I’d never been in a cave. And I’d never really been interested.

He then asked me how I was feeling. I answered honestly. That the drowsiness had just started to settle in. I checked the time, seeing that I’d been awake for just over fifteen hours at that point.

He said that we better get going then. Because it was going to take us at least four hours to get to the cave and about another three to traverse all the way down to the cabin.

I asked him what we were going to do if the plan failed. If his theories proved wrong. He just smiled, told me that we’d figure something else out. But he wouldn’t elaborate any further.

I excused myself and went to the bathroom.

I spent a long time in there just pacing around, intermittently splashing my face with water. I knew it was time wasted, but there were just too many thoughts popping up at once. It was hard to deal with. I was panicking. And then came the nausea.

As I was dry heaving into one of the toilets, I could feel my phone vibrating in my pocket. I took it out.

I need to tell someone what happened. I keep thinking I should go to the news, or find a lawyer, or something. But the NDA I signed? Pretty sure it's airtight. And anyway, who's going to believe me? The researchers don't. Every time I call, I get the same line: All test subjects recovered normally within seventy-two hours of the neutralizing agent. But I know what I know.

Six years of pain. Ever since I blew out both knees playing college ball. The doctors gave it a name ""Severe bilateral patellofemoral pain syndrome with cartilage degeneration."" What it meant was this: every step felt like grinding glass. Every stair was a negotiation. Some nights I'd end up on the kitchen floor, heating pads on both knees, just rocking. Crying. Not even trying to stop.

I tried everything. PT, cortisone, anti-inflammatories, opioids that made me sick and constipated and almost got me hooked. The bills already bankrupted me once. I was working a desk job that barely covered rent, forget the doctor visits.

Saw the ad for a clinical trial, $2,500 for a month-long study of some ""revolutionary long-acting analgesic."" I called that same day.

NeuroVantage was in one of those glass buildings downtown. The kind with valet parking and fake plants that probably cost more than my rent. Waiting room had leather chairs, abstract art, magazines that weren't ancient.

Dr. Sarah Chen looked mid-forties, maybe. Graying hair, sharp eyes. She talked like someone who didn't need you to trust her, because you already did.

""It's called NX-47,"" she said, pushing a stack of papers across the desk. ""Synthetic compound. Blocks pain signals at the cellular level. One injection, four weeks of relief."" I stopped reading. Four weeks. No pain. I didn't care what the rest said.

""After injection into the gluteus maximus, the compound is slowly metabolized by the liver. Most subjects report complete pain relief within six hours and no adverse effects.""

Most subjects. I should have asked about the others.

The shot was nothing. Nurse took me to a room, had me lie face-down, gave me the injection. Felt like any other needle. Quick. Forgettable.

Dr. Chen told me to keep a daily journal documenting any effects, positive or negative, and to call immediately if I experienced anything concerning.

I drove home expecting nothing to happen for hours. But somewhere on the freeway, I realized I'd been unconsciously shifting my weight in the driver's seat, trying to find a comfortable position for my knees. Then I noticed I wasn't doing it anymore. By the time I parked in my driveway, the constant low-level ache that had been my companion for six years was gone.

That night? Eight hours straight. First time since college. Next morning, I started the journal.

Day 1: October 15th

Woke up at 7:30. No alarm.

Slept straight through. Eight hours.

I haven't done that in years. Usually I'm up three, four times a night, every time I roll over, the knees flare up. Getting out of bed felt weird.

I kept bracing for it. That grinding glass feeling. But it didn't come.

I walked to the kitchen. Just walked. No limping, no favoring one side, no grabbing the wall. Made coffee. Stood there drinking it. Just stood there.

I didn't realize how much I'd been shifting, leaning, adjusting, until I wasn't.

Tried walking around the block. Made it halfway. My knees didn't hurt, but my legs felt weak. Like I'd been in bed for months. I guess I've been guarding my knees so long the rest of me forgot how to move.

Weird thing at lunch though, I bit my tongue. Not that hard, just one of those accidental bites. But it barely registered. No wince, no sharp jolt. Just... distant. Maybe I'm so focused on the pain being gone that everything else feels muted.

Dr. Chen called tonight. Asked how I was doing. I told her everything was perfect. She sounded pleased. Said to keep documenting everything. ""*Even positive changes can be significant data points.""* I didn't ask what kind of changes she meant.

Day 2: October 16th

Something happened last night. I'm still shaking.

Got up around 3 to pee. Half-asleep, still not used to sleeping through the night.

Stumbled in the dark. Hit my pinky toe on the dresser. J

Jesus. It felt like someone crushed my whole foot with a hammer. I dropped. Couldn't scream. Just these awful choking sounds while I grabbed at it. Crawled to the light switch. Thought I'd see blood. Bone. Something torn open.

But there was barely anything. Just a red dot. I sat on the bathroom floor staring at it. Twenty minutes, maybe more. The pain faded, but I couldn't stop thinking about it.

It felt like the worst injury I've ever had. From stubbing my toe. My knees are still perfect. No pain at all. But that toe thing won't leave me alone. It keeps looping in my head. Something's happening. I know it.

Day 3: October 17th

Called in sick today. Couldn't focus after last night.

Thought maybe some fresh air would help. It was nice out, mid 70s, light breeze.

I sat on the back patio for ten minutes.

Then my skin started burning.

At first I thought I was imagining it. Maybe I was still shaken up. But it kept getting worse. It felt like I was under a heat lamp. It quickly moved from warm to scorching.

Then it got worse. My arms, face, neck, every exposed part felt like it was pressed against a stove. I ran inside.

The second I crossed the door, it stopped. I stood in the kitchen, breathing hard, trying to make sense of it.

Then I realized.

The sun. Normal sunlight felt like torture.

I called NeuroVantage around 3. Got bounced around until someone picked up. Said she was Dr. Chen's assistant.

I told her what happened. Long pause.

""Have you experienced any other unusual sensations?""

Her voice was flat. Careful. Like she was reading something. I told her about the toe. Another pause.

""Mr. Patterson, these sound like normal adjustment responses. Please continue documenting everything and call us if symptoms worsen significantly.""

""Normal adjustment? I can't go outside.""

""The compound affects neural pathways in complex ways. Temporary hypersensitivity isn't unusual.""

She sounded like she'd said it before.

I asked if other people had gone through this. She said she couldn't discuss other cases.

Before hanging up, she reminded me about their emergency line. ""If absolutely necessary.""

My knees still feel perfect. No pain at all. Whatever this drug is doing, it's doing exactly what they said it would. But everything else feels off.

Day 4: October 18th

I'm writing this at 2:47 AM because I can't sleep and I need to get this down while it's still fresh.

Temperature dropped tonight. Must've hit the low 50s because the heater kicked on around midnight. I was lying in bed when I heard the click of the thermostat, then the whoosh of air through the vents.

The first breath of warm air hit my face and I thought I was going to die.

It felt like opening an oven and sticking my head inside. The air from the vent, which is usually soft and warm, hit my skin like steam. I rolled off the bed and hit the floor, gasping. My whole body felt like it was being scalded.

I crawled to the hallway and shut off the thermostat. Then I lay on the bathroom tiles until the burning stopped. Took fifteen minutes before I could think straight again. I checked my skin in the mirror. Nothing. No redness, no marks. Just normal skin. It felt like third-degree burns, but there was nothing.

I'm sitting here now wearing three layers with the windows cracked open. The house is freezing but I can't risk turning the heat back on.

This isn't ""normal adjustment."" Something's going wrong in my nervous system. The drug was supposed to block pain, but it's like it's amplifying everything else. A breeze feels like sandpaper. My sheets felt like steel wool when I tried to get back in bed.

I keep thinking about the assistant's voice. The way she paused when I described it. Like she was checking something. Comparing symptoms to a list.

I'm going to call the emergency line. I can't keep doing this.

Day 5: October 19th

I'm back home.

Called NeuroVantage at 4 in the morning. Got transferred three times before someone could schedule an emergency appointment. Dr. Chen was ""unavailable."" They said Dr. Martinez could see me at 10.

I was driving downtown when the hunger hit. Started as normal stomach rumbling. Within minutes it felt like my insides were being shredded. I pulled into a gas station, doubled over the steering wheel, gasping. Thought maybe something ruptured.

I stumbled into the store and grabbed the first thing I saw. Box of powdered donuts. Tore it open and started eating right there in the aisle. Clerk stared at me. I didn't care. I ate four, fast, shoving them in until the pain stopped.

He asked if I was okay. I mumbled something about low blood sugar and bought the rest of the box.

Dr. Martinez was younger than Chen. Nervous. Kept asking about my ""pain tolerance baseline."" Checked a tablet while I talked. When I told him about the heater incident, he nodded like he'd heard it before.

""We can administer a neutralizing compound,"" he said. ""It should counteract the NX-47 within twenty-four hours.""

The needle looked normal. Standard vaccine type. When it went in, I screamed.

It felt like a red-hot poker. Pain shot up my arm and through my whole body. I started hyperventilating. Vision went black around the edges. Next thing I knew, I was on the floor. Martinez was kneeling beside me, asking if I could hear him.

""The effects appear to be intensifying,"" he said to someone else in the room. ""We should document the timeline more carefully.""

I wanted to ask what he meant by that. Couldn't speak. Just focused on breathing.

It's been six hours since the shot. Still hypersensitive. The tags in my shirt feel like razor blades. My neighbor's dog barking makes my skin crawl.

Please let this work. I can't live like this.

Day 6: October 20th

The shot didn't work, or if it did, it's taking it's sweet time about it.

Everything is backwards now. Everything.

Made hot chocolate this morning. First sip tasted like poison. Like licking a battery. Spit it out and dropped the mug.

The mug hit my hand and broke on the floor. Should've hurt.

It felt incredible.

A wave of pure bliss shot up my arm. Better than any painkiller I've ever taken. Had to grab the counter to keep from falling over. The bruise is getting darker and it feels amazing every time I touch it.

I can't eat. Everything tastes like ash. Water tastes like metal. But pain, oh God, pain feels like heaven.

I have scratches on my arms. Don't remember making them. Three lines on each side. They feel good. I keep catching myself trying to make more. Had to leave the kitchen because I kept staring at the broken pieces of the mug.

This is sick. I know it's sick. But I can't stop thinking about it.

Food is poison. Pain is pleasure. What did they do to me?

Went to NeuroVantage. Couldn't wait. It's the weekend and the building was locked, but I saw movement in the windows upstairs. Banged on the door until security came down.

""I need Dr. Chen. Now.""

She came down twenty minutes later. Tired eyes. Overworked. She wasn't surprised. She knew.

""Mr. Patterson. How are you feeling?""

""Fix this. Please. Whatever you did to me, fix it.""

She told me to follow her upstairs. The elevator was too bright. The humming too loud. Everything was too much but I needed answers.

Her office looked different. The abstract art on the walls seemed to move when I wasn't looking straight at it. She sat behind her desk and opened a file. Thicker than I remembered.

""The occasional hypersensitivity phase typically lasts only two to six hours,"" she said, her eyes focused on the files. ""Then the neural pathways begin to reorganize.""

""What does that mean?""

""NX-47 doesn't just block pain signals, Mr. Patterson. It alters how your nervous system processes sensory input. The initial effect is complete analgesia for the targeted pain source. But the compound continues working, remapping your entire pain response system.""

""You knew this would happen.""

""The inversion is temporary. In most cases. Your system should return to baseline within two to three days.""

She closed the file.

""Some subjects experience profound neurological changes. The compound appears to reverse the polarity of pain and pleasure receptors in approximately two percent of test subjects. This should only last a few days. You should be able to manage.""

""Should? Manage? I can't eat food. I can't go outside. I can't touch anything without wanting to scream or hurt myself.""

""The cravings for self-harm are concerning, but they typically diminish as the neutralizing compound works through the system.""

""You're talking about me like I'm a lab rat.""

She looked up.

""Mr. Patterson, you signed a comprehensive consent form acknowledging the experimental nature of NX-47. All potential side effects were disclosed.""

""Potential side effects? You buried this in forty pages of medical jargon.""

""The compensation was commensurate with the risk level.""

I wanted to hit something. The urge was so strong I had to grip the arms of the chair.

""How many people have you done this to?""

""NX-47 has shown remarkable success in eliminating chronic pain conditions. The preliminary trials have been very promising.""

""How many, Dr. Chen?""

""Patient confidentiality prevents me from discussing specific numbers.""

""But there are others.""

""Yes. There are others.""

""What if I report this? What if I go to the FDA?""

""Mr. Patterson, you voluntarily enrolled in an FDA-approved clinical trial. All procedures were conducted according to federal guidelines. Your signature is on every consent document.""

""But you didn't tell me this would happen.""

""We informed you that NX-47 was an experimental compound with unknown long-term effects. The neurological remapping was listed as a possible outcome in section twelve of the consent documentation.""

I tried to remember section twelve. Tried to remember reading any of it carefully. But I'd been desperate. All I saw was the promise of four weeks without knee pain.

She stood up.

""Mr. Patterson, I understand you're distressed. But the compound has accomplished exactly what you hoped it would. Your chronic pain is gone. The side effects are manageable with proper support. The neutralizing agent will completely stop the side effects within the next few days, and unfortunately, the pain will return as well.""

I was escorted out. Dejected. Tired.

Day 8: October 22nd

Something's happening to my perception.

Colors look more intense, but also distorted. The red numbers on my alarm clock look like they're bleeding. The green light on the coffee maker pulses like a heartbeat.

Sounds are unbearable. My neighbor's leaf blower sounds like a hurricane. The refrigerator hum makes my teeth ache.

The mirror is the worst part. I look the same, but something's off. Like I'm seeing myself from a slight angle, even when I'm standing straight. My eyes look darker, tired, different.

I called NeuroVantage to ask about visual disturbances. Same assistant answered. Put me on hold for five minutes, came back and said ""perceptual changes are within normal parameters for NX-47 subjects.""

Normal parameters. Everything is normal parameters with them.

The scratches and bruises are healing. I miss them. I miss how they felt.

I keep thinking about making new ones.

That's not normal. That can't be normal parameters.

Day 9: October 23rd

This morning I woke up and my nerve endings were growing outside my skin.

I could see them. Hair-thin silver wires coming out of every inch of me, spreading across the sheets like spider webs. They pulsed with each heartbeat. I could watch signals traveling through them, little flashes of light moving along the strands.

The wires were connecting to everything. The lamp, the alarm clock, the heating vent. Every time something made noise or changed temperature, I felt it through the wires. When the furnace kicked on, pleasure flooded my system. When a car drove past, the vibrations came up through the floor and into the network. Each pulse felt better than anything I've ever known.

I touched one. It was like touching my own brain. I felt the electricity of my nervous system, raw and unfiltered. The euphoria was so intense I blacked out.

When I came to, I was on the floor next to the bed. Blood on my hands. The wires were still there, still connected to everything, but some were broken. The broken ends sparked. Each spark sent waves of ecstasy through me.

I crawled to the bathroom and looked in the mirror. The wires were everywhere. Face, scalp, arms. They moved when I breathed. In the reflection, I saw them spreading behind me, a silver web linking me to every surface.

I knew it couldn't be real. Nerve endings don't grow outside the body. But I could feel every wire. I could trace their paths. When I brushed against the door frame, pleasure shot through the wires and dropped me to my knees.

I called 911. The paramedics couldn't see the wires. They walked through them. Every time they touched one, I screamed. One kept saying ""Sir, there's nothing there"" while the other prepared a sedative.

But I could feel his radio. I could feel the engine of the ambulance. I could feel everything.

They sedated me. The needle went in and I watched the drug move through one of the wires like dark fluid in a clear tube. It felt incredible. Better than the scratches. Better than the broken mug. Better than anything.

Now I'm in the psychiatric ward. The doctors can't see the wires, but they're still here. They've spread further. They reach across the room to the medical equipment, the other patients, the electrical systems in the walls. I can feel everything the hospital feels. Every heartbeat from the monitors. Every breath from the ventilators. Every pulse from every machine.

The nurse came in to check my IV. She walked through a cluster of wires and I had to bite my tongue to keep from moaning. She made a note on my chart about ""continued visual hallucinations"" and left.

They don't understand. The wires aren't hallucinations. They're adaptations. My nervous system is evolving. NX-47 is turning me into something that can experience everything as pleasure.

They kept me here for three days. Sedated and restrained.

First night was the worst. The IV needle felt like molten metal. But good molten metal. The dry sheets of the hospital bed felt like sandpaper and sent waves of pleasure over my skin.

The heart monitor beeped steadily. Each beep felt like a tiny shock in my ears. I started timing my breathing to match the beeps, trying to make it stronger.

Second night, the wires started fading. I was sad to see them go.

They ran every test. Blood work, MRI, neurological exams. Dr. Rodriguez kept asking about drug use like I was some junkie. All the tests came back normal. Perfect. My knee cartilage looked better than it had in years.

""Sometimes the mind can play tricks when we're under stress,"" he said.

Dr. Chen visited on the second day. She brought a man in a suit. Said NeuroVantage would cover all hospital costs as a courtesy. Didn't mention the $2500 from the study. I didn't ask. Money feels pointless when you can't tell if you're losing your mind.

By the third day, things started changing back. The IV needle just felt like a needle. Food tasted like food again. And the pain came back. Slow at first, then stronger. My knees feel like they're grinding again.

I should be relieved. Instead I feel like I lost something. Like waking up from the best dream I've ever had.

They discharged me this afternoon. Bottle of ibuprofen. Pamphlet about stress management. Dr. Rodriguez shook my hand and wished me luck with my ""adjustment period.""

Got home and found three lawyers sitting in my driveway.

Black sedan. Tinted windows. Waiting by the front door. One was the same suit from the hospital. He had a briefcase full of papers.

""Mr. Patterson, we need to discuss your recent medical expenses.""

The hospital bill was $47,000. They said they'd pay it all, but only if I signed their agreement. Liability waiver. Non-disclosure. Nothing unusual.

I started reading the fine print. My hands were shaking from rage.

The papers said I'd never talk about what happened. Never seek more medical care related to the trial. Never contact other test subjects. If I broke any of it, I'd owe them the full hospital cost plus damages.

""What if I don't sign?""

The lawyer smiled.

""Then you're responsible for your own medical expenses and their consequences.""

Forty-seven thousand dollars. I don't have forty-seven thousand dollars.

I signed.

My knees are killing me tonight. Back to the old pain like the last few days never happened.

I should be grateful.

But I keep thinking about the silver wires. The way they pulsed. The way they connected me to everything.

What if I wasn't hallucinating.

What if they know I wasn't.

What if I could reach out and feel them again.

I'm calling NeuroVantage tomorrow.

I need to tell someone what happened. I keep thinking I should go to the news, or find a lawyer, or something. But the NDA I signed? Pretty sure it's airtight. And anyway, who's going to believe me? The researchers don't. Every time I call, I get the same line: All test subjects recovered normally within seventy-two hours of the neutralizing agent. But I know what I know.

Six years of pain. Ever since I blew out both knees playing college ball. The doctors gave it a name ""Severe bilateral patellofemoral pain syndrome with cartilage degeneration."" What it meant was this: every step felt like grinding glass. Every stair was a negotiation. Some nights I'd end up on the kitchen floor, heating pads on both knees, just rocking. Crying. Not even trying to stop.

I tried everything. PT, cortisone, anti-inflammatories, opioids that made me sick and constipated and almost got me hooked. The bills already bankrupted me once. I was working a desk job that barely covered rent, forget the doctor visits.

Saw the ad for a clinical trial, $2,500 for a month-long study of some ""revolutionary long-acting analgesic."" I called that same day.

NeuroVantage was in one of those glass buildings downtown. The kind with valet parking and fake plants that probably cost more than my rent. Waiting room had leather chairs, abstract art, magazines that weren't ancient.

Dr. Sarah Chen looked mid-forties, maybe. Graying hair, sharp eyes. She talked like someone who didn't need you to trust her, because you already did.

""It's called NX-47,"" she said, pushing a stack of papers across the desk. ""Synthetic compound. Blocks pain signals at the cellular level. One injection, four weeks of relief."" I stopped reading. Four weeks. No pain. I didn't care what the rest said.

""After injection into the gluteus maximus, the compound is slowly metabolized by the liver. Most subjects report complete pain relief within six hours and no adverse effects.""

Most subjects. I should have asked about the others.

The shot was nothing. Nurse took me to a room, had me lie face-down, gave me the injection. Felt like any other needle. Quick. Forgettable.

Dr. Chen told me to keep a daily journal documenting any effects, positive or negative, and to call immediately if I experienced anything concerning.

I drove home expecting nothing to happen for hours. But somewhere on the freeway, I realized I'd been unconsciously shifting my weight in the driver's seat, trying to find a comfortable position for my knees. Then I noticed I wasn't doing it anymore. By the time I parked in my driveway, the constant low-level ache that had been my companion for six years was gone.

That night? Eight hours straight. First time since college. Next morning, I started the journal.

Day 1: October 15th

Woke up at 7:30. No alarm.

Slept straight through. Eight hours.

I haven't done that in years. Usually I'm up three, four times a night, every time I roll over, the knees flare up. Getting out of bed felt weird.

I kept bracing for it. That grinding glass feeling. But it didn't come.

I walked to the kitchen. Just walked. No limping, no favoring one side, no grabbing the wall. Made coffee. Stood there drinking it. Just stood there.

I didn't realize how much I'd been shifting, leaning, adjusting, until I wasn't.

Tried walking around the block. Made it halfway. My knees didn't hurt, but my legs felt weak. Like I'd been in bed for months. I guess I've been guarding my knees so long the rest of me forgot how to move.

Weird thing at lunch though, I bit my tongue. Not that hard, just one of those accidental bites. But it barely registered. No wince, no sharp jolt. Just... distant. Maybe I'm so focused on the pain being gone that everything else feels muted.

Dr. Chen called tonight. Asked how I was doing. I told her everything was perfect. She sounded pleased. Said to keep documenting everything. ""*Even positive changes can be significant data points.""* I didn't ask what kind of changes she meant.

Day 2: October 16th

Something happened last night. I'm still shaking.

Got up around 3 to pee. Half-asleep, still not used to sleeping through the night.

Stumbled in the dark. Hit my pinky toe on the dresser. J

Jesus. It felt like someone crushed my whole foot with a hammer. I dropped. Couldn't scream. Just these awful choking sounds while I grabbed at it. Crawled to the light switch. Thought I'd see blood. Bone. Something torn open.

But there was barely anything. Just a red dot. I sat on the bathroom floor staring at it. Twenty minutes, maybe more. The pain faded, but I couldn't stop thinking about it.

It felt like the worst injury I've ever had. From stubbing my toe. My knees are still perfect. No pain at all. But that toe thing won't leave me alone. It keeps looping in my head. Something's happening. I know it.

Day 3: October 17th

Called in sick today. Couldn't focus after last night.

Thought maybe some fresh air would help. It was nice out, mid 70s, light breeze.

I sat on the back patio for ten minutes.

Then my skin started burning.

At first I thought I was imagining it. Maybe I was still shaken up. But it kept getting worse. It felt like I was under a heat lamp. It quickly moved from warm to scorching.

Then it got worse. My arms, face, neck, every exposed part felt like it was pressed against a stove. I ran inside.

The second I crossed the door, it stopped. I stood in the kitchen, breathing hard, trying to make sense of it.

Then I realized.

The sun. Normal sunlight felt like torture.

I called NeuroVantage around 3. Got bounced around until someone picked up. Said she was Dr. Chen's assistant.

I told her what happened. Long pause.

""Have you experienced any other unusual sensations?""

Her voice was flat. Careful. Like she was reading something. I told her about the toe. Another pause.

""Mr. Patterson, these sound like normal adjustment responses. Please continue documenting everything and call us if symptoms worsen significantly.""

""Normal adjustment? I can't go outside.""

""The compound affects neural pathways in complex ways. Temporary hypersensitivity isn't unusual.""

She sounded like she'd said it before.

I asked if other people had gone through this. She said she couldn't discuss other cases.

Before hanging up, she reminded me about their emergency line. ""If absolutely necessary.""

My knees still feel perfect. No pain at all. Whatever this drug is doing, it's doing exactly what they said it would. But everything else feels off.

Day 4: October 18th

I'm writing this at 2:47 AM because I can't sleep and I need to get this down while it's still fresh.

Temperature dropped tonight. Must've hit the low 50s because the heater kicked on around midnight. I was lying in bed when I heard the click of the thermostat, then the whoosh of air through the vents.

The first breath of warm air hit my face and I thought I was going to die.

It felt like opening an oven and sticking my head inside. The air from the vent, which is usually soft and warm, hit my skin like steam. I rolled off the bed and hit the floor, gasping. My whole body felt like it was being scalded.

I crawled to the hallway and shut off the thermostat. Then I lay on the bathroom tiles until the burning stopped. Took fifteen minutes before I could think straight again. I checked my skin in the mirror. Nothing. No redness, no marks. Just normal skin. It felt like third-degree burns, but there was nothing.

I'm sitting here now wearing three layers with the windows cracked open. The house is freezing but I can't risk turning the heat back on.

This isn't ""normal adjustment."" Something's going wrong in my nervous system. The drug was supposed to block pain, but it's like it's amplifying everything else. A breeze feels like sandpaper. My sheets felt like steel wool when I tried to get back in bed.

I keep thinking about the assistant's voice. The way she paused when I described it. Like she was checking something. Comparing symptoms to a list.

I'm going to call the emergency line. I can't keep doing this.

Day 5: October 19th

I'm back home.

Called NeuroVantage at 4 in the morning. Got transferred three times before someone could schedule an emergency appointment. Dr. Chen was ""unavailable."" They said Dr. Martinez could see me at 10.

I was driving downtown when the hunger hit. Started as normal stomach rumbling. Within minutes it felt like my insides were being shredded. I pulled into a gas station, doubled over the steering wheel, gasping. Thought maybe something ruptured.

I stumbled into the store and grabbed the first thing I saw. Box of powdered donuts. Tore it open and started eating right there in the aisle. Clerk stared at me. I didn't care. I ate four, fast, shoving them in until the pain stopped.

He asked if I was okay. I mumbled something about low blood sugar and bought the rest of the box.

Dr. Martinez was younger than Chen. Nervous. Kept asking about my ""pain tolerance baseline."" Checked a tablet while I talked. When I told him about the heater incident, he nodded like he'd heard it before.

""We can administer a neutralizing compound,"" he said. ""It should counteract the NX-47 within twenty-four hours.""

The needle looked normal. Standard vaccine type. When it went in, I screamed.

It felt like a red-hot poker. Pain shot up my arm and through my whole body. I started hyperventilating. Vision went black around the edges. Next thing I knew, I was on the floor. Martinez was kneeling beside me, asking if I could hear him.

""The effects appear to be intensifying,"" he said to someone else in the room. ""We should document the timeline more carefully.""

I wanted to ask what he meant by that. Couldn't speak. Just focused on breathing.

It's been six hours since the shot. Still hypersensitive. The tags in my shirt feel like razor blades. My neighbor's dog barking makes my skin crawl.

Please let this work. I can't live like this.

Day 6: October 20th

The shot didn't work, or if it did, it's taking it's sweet time about it.

Everything is backwards now. Everything.

Made hot chocolate this morning. First sip tasted like poison. Like licking a battery. Spit it out and dropped the mug.

The mug hit my hand and broke on the floor. Should've hurt.

It felt incredible.

A wave of pure bliss shot up my arm. Better than any painkiller I've ever taken. Had to grab the counter to keep from falling over. The bruise is getting darker and it feels amazing every time I touch it.

I can't eat. Everything tastes like ash. Water tastes like metal. But pain, oh God, pain feels like heaven.

I have scratches on my arms. Don't remember making them. Three lines on each side. They feel good. I keep catching myself trying to make more. Had to leave the kitchen because I kept staring at the broken pieces of the mug.

This is sick. I know it's sick. But I can't stop thinking about it.

Food is poison. Pain is pleasure. What did they do to me?

Went to NeuroVantage. Couldn't wait. It's the weekend and the building was locked, but I saw movement in the windows upstairs. Banged on the door until security came down.

""I need Dr. Chen. Now.""

She came down twenty minutes later. Tired eyes. Overworked. She wasn't surprised. She knew.

""Mr. Patterson. How are you feeling?""

""Fix this. Please. Whatever you did to me, fix it.""

She told me to follow her upstairs. The elevator was too bright. The humming too loud. Everything was too much but I needed answers.

Her office looked different. The abstract art on the walls seemed to move when I wasn't looking straight at it. She sat behind her desk and opened a file. Thicker than I remembered.

""The occasional hypersensitivity phase typically lasts only two to six hours,"" she said, her eyes focused on the files. ""Then the neural pathways begin to reorganize.""

""The cravings for self-harm are concerning, but they typically diminish as the neutralizing compound works through the system.""

""You're talking about me like I'm a lab rat.""

She looked up.

""Mr. Patterson, you signed a comprehensive consent form acknowledging the experimental nature of NX-47. All potential side effects were disclosed.""

Apparently the staff know him, he lives above the building, the machine is right by the entrance, the queue is often long, and he often needs to leave for work in a hurry. 

The man seems to have worked out a decent system lol. Have you ever met someone doing that? It feels deeply illegal somehow, but why not i suppose?",82,1757650858.0,Tokyo,37,0.89,False
1netpxh,https://www.reddit.com/r/utarlington/comments/1netpxh/trying_to_meet_friends_in_nursing/,Trying to meet friends in Nursing,"Hey everyone! I’m a student at UTA and I’m working on my prerequisites for nursing. I’d really like to connect with other people who are also on the nursing track (whether pre-nursing or already in the program).

I’m trying to balance classes, studying, and working out, but it’d be awesome to have friends who are going through the same grind—whether it’s study sessions, hanging out on campus, or just motivating each other.

If you’re in nursing (or planning to apply soon), how do you usually study, and do you meet up with classmates for it? I’d be down to form a small group or just grab coffee and chat sometime.",1,1757650771.0,utarlington,0,1.0,False
1netptw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1netptw,Broke up with my bf of 5 years over this,He’s been telling me it’s just him being dumb. Should I believe him? The text exchange he said is just between him and an old friend. And then I asked to see his phone and dug further into his phone with him there and saw the apps that were downloaded. I logged into one of them and there is a profile created. Before I could look further he takes the phone out of my hand. He wants me to just believe he is innocent and nothing serious has been going on. He said he was just curious about the apps and that he has never cheated on me. ,398,1757650763.0,WhatShouldIDo,230,0.9,False
