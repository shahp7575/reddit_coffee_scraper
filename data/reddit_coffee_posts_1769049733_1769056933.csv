I'm super chill and can be your new friend.,"Hi I'm your friendly, nice, and funny new friend who is super chill and quiet. I like listening to music from rock, house, ambient, lofi, some rap and liminal. 

Usually I can be found sleeping or on my motorcycle riding around. Usually to a downtown city and grab a cup of coffee, walk around and browse the local shops. I was just in Pomona to check out a concert which was fun. But I live in Yucaipa area. I like checking out thrift shops, record stores, going to small concerts, and hiking sometimes. 

Also into photography so I'll usually carry my camera sometimes in my bag haha. Oh I like treats and snacks too. 

I don't really play video games anymore, but do watch YouTube videos and try to catch up on TV shows.

There's a profound satisfaction in the ritual of preparing coffee. It begins with the promise held within a whole bean, the rich aroma that hints at what’s to come, and culminates in that first, perfect sip. But the journey from coffee bean to expertly ground coffee powder is where the magic truly unfolds, and it’s a journey Intelligentsia Coffee has perfected.

You might think all coffee powder is created equal. Yet, the difference between a good cup and an extraordinary one lies in the very source of the bean and how it’s treated. At Intelligentsia, we are pioneers of **Direct Trade**, building foundational, multi-year relationships with our farmers. This means we pay significantly above Fair Trade prices, ensuring you receive beans of unparalleled quality, cultivated with care and ethical integrity. We don't just source; we cultivate partnerships, all to bring you the most vibrant and flavorful coffee possible.

Furthermore, the concept of ""freshness"" in coffee is paramount. We roast our coffee **Roast-to-Order**. This isn’t just a detail; it's our commitment to you. Your coffee is never sitting on a shelf; it’s roasted specifically for your order and shipped immediately. This guarantees that when you grind your beans or receive our expertly ground coffee powder, you're experiencing coffee at its absolute peak.

Why does this matter for your daily cup?

*   **Unrivaled Freshness:** Coffee powder, when ground just before brewing, preserves its volatile aromatics. Our Roast-to-Order model ensures this freshness is locked in from our roastery to your grinder.
*   **Exceptional Flavor Clarity:** Direct Trade allows us meticulous control over bean selection, resulting in distinct flavor profiles – from the bold, syrupy body of our legendary **Black Cat Espresso** to the bright, nuanced notes in our single origins.
*   **Ethical Sourcing:** Your enjoyment directly supports the farmers who grow these exceptional beans, fostering sustainable practices and community development.

1qjkwol,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_throwra_butterpasta/comments/1qjkwol/longterm_open_relationship_repeated_conflict/,"Long-term open relationship, repeated conflict escalation. Unsure whether to work through it or slowly step back? (F29, F36)","Im looking for outside perspectives on what to do next in my relationship

I (29F) have been with my partner (36F) for almost 3 years. We live together and are engaged. We’re in an open relationship due to a large libido mismatch (hers being very low). There are agreed rules around transparency, check-ins, and sharing information when seeing others.

She is autistic + ADHD; I. I also have lupus, and emotional stress is a known trigger for flares, so conflict affects me physically as well as emotionally.

About 1.5 years into the relationship we had a very rocky period where I made mistakes around the open relationship - e.g. forgetting to message the address of the person i was going to. We went to therapy and things improved significantly. 

I proposed maybe 10 months after that period because things felt stable.

Recently I’ve begun seeing others again. Two encounters went fine. The most recent one did not.

Recent incident (briefly):

\- I went to meet someone at a hotel bar.

\- My partner had been ghosted by someone she was meant to meet that night.

\- I offered to stay home with her; she encouraged me to go.

\- I arrived, the other person was late, and I didn’t proactively message that he was late (apparently an unstated expectation).

\- When he arrived, I learned his name but didn’t immediately message it (I planned to before leaving the bar).

\- She texted asking for the name about 15 mins into meeting the guy; I didn’t hear the notification.

\- About 8 minutes later she called which i answered promptly, angry, and told me to come home immediately.

\- I tried to explain and share the info then, but she said calling = “game over” and any negotiation was unacceptable.

\- I came home, but she stonewalled me and refused any form of comfort or resolution that night.

I apologized for missing the message, not sharing the name immediately, and not leaving the moment she called. She maintains that the issue wasn’t the mistake itself, but that she had to call at all, and that my attempt to negotiate staying was selfish.

Bigger picture: 

Over the last 6–12 months, I’ve noticed a pattern where during stressful or disappointing situations she escalates quickly into anger and blame, often attributing intent to me (“you didn’t care,” “you were selfish,” “you forced me”). 

Examples include:

\- Being blamed for parking confusion on a snow trip

\- Being accused of forcing her onto a ski trail that she felt sore from going on, tantrum ensued

\- Being blamed for not sticking up for her when she started getting angry and yelling/swearing at a random person who cut her off at the end of a ski run

\- Being called selfish while I was recovering from a surgery for not going downstairs for coffee while I was in too much pain (struggled to walk myself to the toilet in the room)

\- Being accused of intentionally messing up her coffee order a couple days later -- words like ""proof you just dont care"" flung

\- Being blamed for her sunburn because I “should have ensured” sunscreen, since I wanted the beach outing, mid UV overcast day (I was burnt a little too, even while remembering to do my own sunscreen -- i do this daily though as a routine for myself)

Typically, conflict involves withdrawal, stonewalling, or prolonged shutdown, and I’m usually the one initiating repair. I feel like I’m increasingly walking on eggshells and worrying about what mistake will trigger the next blow-up.

I love her deeply and we are very compatible in many ways outside of sex and conflict. But I’m increasingly feeling emotionally unsafe, hyper-vigilant, and worried about the impact on my health.

Right now I’m emotionally distancing and considering whether it’s healthier to:

Try again only if she independently reflects (therapy or something that shows she understands how her actions are provoking my feelings right now)

Slowly shift toward a more companion/friend-like dynamic

Accept that this may not be sustainable long-term.

I’m not looking for “who’s right,” but want outside perspectives on whether this sounds like something workable with boundaries and therapy?

Or does this pattern suggest incompatibility regardless of love?",1,1769056423.0,u_throwra_butterpasta,0,1.0,False

1qjkvyf,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1qjkvyf/one_month_without_coffeecaffeine/,One month without coffee/caffeine.,"I quit coffee (and thus all caffeine) 1 month ago today. I've been on Carnivore close to a year.

Foods consumed; red meat, butter, A2 heavy cream, shelled seafood. Plain electrolytes and cod liver oil. The only thing I've changed in my diet, other than dropping coffee; trying to add more fat to my meals, and occasionally adding shelled seafood.

**Benefits I expected from quitting caffeine;**

1. More consistent energy.
2. Better waking cycles and rest.
3. Less joint pain.
4. Un-stalled weight loss.
5. Less dependence on electrolytes.
6. Skin improvements.

**Actual benefits I've obtained from quitting caffeine;**

1. A calmer mind; less easy to bother, far less racing thoughts.
2. TMI, but >!less bathroom trips!< overall which is nice.

**And now... the downsides;**

1. Energy levels have not improved (I've had to take a nap and a micro-nap these past 2 days).
2. Waking cycle has not improved at all. Rest is about the same.
3. Joint pain is about the same.
4. Weight has stayed the same.
5. Electrolyte balance still requires the same amount of electrolyte supplementation.
6. My skin has actually gotten worse, though this might partially be caused by recent cold medicine (I currently have a cold).

I also read that caffeine can make histamine intolerance worse, which is one reason why I think I should stay off it.

Anyhow, I'm not sure if I have to just give this caffeine-free thing another month or not... especially since my husband says he's worried for me, as he said when we had a short argument over it earlier. He seems irritated that I quit (he didn't want me to quit in the first place), and thinks it's unhealthy for me to remain caffeine-free. He says it's been messing with my mood (I'm not seeing it). He also misses us having 1 more thing to do and enjoy together.

I’m building in public and wanted to share an idea I’m currently validating.

I’m working on a mobile budgeting app where the AI runs fully offline on the device.

The core principles are intentionally simple:

	•	📱 Mobile-first

	•	🧠 AI runs locally (on-device)

	•	❌ No bank sync

	•	❌ No cloud storage

	•	❌ No signup / account

	•	🔒 Data never leaves the phone

Instead of complex dashboards, the app focuses on:

	•	Natural input like: “Coffee $15”

	•	A small, clean dashboard for daily/monthly overview

	•	An optional end-of-day review to confirm or add transactions

The tradeoff is less automation, but more trust, control, and privacy.

Right now, I’ve built a landing page and some UI prototypes and I’m trying to answer a few questions before going further:

	•	Does an offline-first AI approach make sense on mobile?

	•	Is “no signup + no cloud” a real advantage, or a limitation?

	•	Would you personally use something like this?

Not selling anything — genuinely looking for feedback while I build this out in public.

How it gnaws away at the precious thread of trust that binds two souls together. I remember well when a close friend revealed he had cheated on his partner. The look in his eyes was a cacophony of guilt, fear and sorrow. It was in that moment that the catastrophic consequence of infidelity sunk in.

With that revelation, I thought deeply about the way society often romanticizes the idea of forbidden affairs. A brief fling, a passionate connection, sounds alluring in the words of a paperback romance. But does fiction truly mirror reality? When that elicit liaison leaves hearts shattered and lives irreparably damaged?

One evening, I found myself sitting in a coffee shop, a guilt-ridden friend confessing his mistakes. The hurt he caused, the trust broken, the betrayal that his partner faced, turned out to be a heavy burden. He wept, and that tear-stricken face held a profound lesson on the dire impact of infidelity.

I've been thinking. Can infidelity ever be justified? Can broken trust ever be fully restored? Is the pain ever truly worth the fleeting moment of pleasure?",2,1769056048.0,Infidelity,2,1.0,False

My (31M) girlfriend (29F) struggles with anxiety since I know her. We are currently on our first year of relationship. I love her very much, I love spending time with her and we get along so well. I live 40 minutes away, but usually stay on the weekends and some days of the week in her apartment.

However how well we get along, every month there are some days where she gets in a depressed mood, usually ends up crying and blaming her anxiety. In those days, communication with her is difficult, and cheering her up impossible. Many times I end up feeling hurt because she won’t talk to me.

She has some unresolved issues with her parents, especially with her father, and also about her job as a teacher(she studied in a music conservatory and also English) She feels stuck in a job that does not pay well and is really stressful.

I am going on a trip to Europe for one month this February with my family(parents and brothers) This was a trip that we have been planing for some years to do. Both my parents have suffered cancer (my mom kidney and my dad lung) so this trip was a project that kept them with motivation to go through that, specially for my father as his cancer is way more complicated(had his fourth surgery a month ago).

The trip to Europe triggers my girlfriend anxiety to the roof. I was in her apartment today, and the topic of the trip was mentioned when we were having lunch. After lunch she went to the bedroom, I assumed to take a nap. I kept working on the living room (I work remote) After some hours of work and her not appearing I go to the bedroom to find her crying sitting in a chair looking outside through the window (she lives in a 2nd floor)

I try to cheer her up, I take her to walk my dog with me and to get a coffee and cake. She seems to cheer up a bit but when returning to the apartment she breaks again. She fears about the relationship through the duration of the trip, how and at what time we are going to communicate, etc, etc. Nothing I do or say can cheer her up or make her see some positive. She says me that she can’t see nothing positive, and sees all dark. I ended up going to my apartment.

She goes to therapy every two weeks, but I don’t see that something gets better. I feel sad and also a bit angry as, I don’t know, but I would like her to feel happy that I can travel with my family.

Are there some tips about what I can do to lighten this up? I do go to therapy too and will try to address this with my therapist but I would like to get some opinions from real experiences.

Facing investors for the first time, it feels like a brand new chapter of my life.

Fifteen years ago, I used the Spider framework to write communication protocol automation scripts. Back then, I already imagined a future of full automation—sipping coffee while scripts generated themselves, tests ran automatically, bugs were reported, development tools made fixes on their own, and everything deployed seamlessly. But that dream felt distant at the time.

Ten years ago, when I started using Appium and Selenium for mobile and web automation, I wondered whether fully automated script generation and execution could ever become real. The frameworks and technical capabilities back then weren’t enough, so I focused on improving my own framework and building automation platforms.

Five years ago, I began using image recognition to achieve fully automated page load testing. That increased testing efficiency by over 10x and expanded test coverage across more scenarios. The related technology was patented and later shared at the Alibaba Cloud Technology Conference. It felt like smart testing was becoming viable in some scenarios, with more image recognition and deep learning frameworks entering the field.

Two years ago, I took on a project to improve testing efficiency with large language models. I started exploring academic solutions, applied for computing resources for training, and after repeated attempts, finally achieved a working LLM agent. We delivered results in case generation, automated script creation, data construction, and report generation. It felt like end-to-end LLM implementation was truly within reach. Around that time, DeepSeek was also launched—the era of LLM agents had arrived.

Six months ago, after careful consideration, I left a world-class global product company to pursue my goal of helping the industry improve efficiency. I wanted to contribute to the practical adoption of LLM agents in testing. The future felt challenging, but the foundation was there—it was time to execute and deliver.

Just one week ago, the GenAgent brand was officially born. We hope to use large language models to help people work more efficiently, and to make our own contribution to the industry.

GenAgent，yes, an AI-driven vibe testing platform built to eliminate UI automation scripting and turns natural language into executed tests across the web & mobile (Android/iOS), and manages the entire lifecycle, from device connection to reporting—without a single script. 

Hey, fellows, if there’s a AI tool like GenAgent, a Full-Stack Support and Full OS Support-(Case → UI → API → Report )-Closed-Loop System. I believe that you will be excitedly eager to try.

It has put a LOT of things in perspective and explains why my life has been so hard. Also makes sense why I used to drink so much coffee and then later starting using marijuana daily - I've been self-medicating to help with the focus and ESPECIALLY executive function. I can't tell you how many times I've popped an edible to help me do the dishes. But of course, took just long enough to get a diagnosis for me to get addicted to weed. Not the worst thing to be addicted to, but the problem is I can't start stimulants until I pass a drug test. 

Been sober 10 days now and it's been hard. I have an appointment in 3 weeks, but I'm not sure if I'm getting drug tested that day, and not sure I'll even pass it. I'm planning to be sober 30 days but I learned (too late) it can sometimes take even longer for heavy users. I also can't drink coffee or caffeine anymore due to my stomach issues (which the weed helps with). I didn't realize I was self-medicating the whole time, but in retrospect I always used to cram for tests and projects by pounding back a ton of coffee. Probably why I have GERD now honestly.

I tried to post this to an ADHD specific community but they wouldn't allow mentions of drug use which is very frustrating. I was originally going to post in a sobriety community, but honestly the cravings and mood swings haven't been too bad. It's mostly that I can't get myself to DO anything unless it's completely necessary. My psychiatrist said she wants to make sure the weed isn't making me lazy, but if anything I feel lazier than ever and it's totally crushing. I've been on a low dose of clonodine but I'm nearly out and she won't refill it, probably so I can wean off to start stimulants. All I know is I'm going to have to completely raw dog this ADHD for a few weeks for the first time since I was like 15 and started drinking coffee, and I've already been struggling just to function.

Can anyone relate to this experience, and do you have any advice or motivation for getting through the next few weeks?",1,1769055870.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I'm turning 30 this week. It's been hard and I'm not at all looking forward to it. I told my mother all I wanted for my birthday was to not have to plan it or beg people to spend time with me; which sounds dramatic but for context, my family is dysfunctional and I usually have to beg people to take me to the store or to the ER or to appointments because I can't drive (which is an even longer story, sorry).

Now I get a phone call from my sister in a bad mood asking me what my top favorite Japanese restaurants are (I don't have a top three because I don't even know of three and I don't eat Japanese food that often) because my mother and her fiancé couldn't figure it out. I tell her I don't know and that this was the opposite of what I wanted because now I'm on the spot making plans a day before my birthday.

I ended up googling some stuff (my mother won't teach me how to drive or drive me to a school so I don't get out much) and there's a museum and a coffee/tea shop but my family hates stuff like that and I just don't feel like begging people to grin and bear it while being asked every 10 minutes when I'll be done.

It's not the activity, it's my family not knowing enough about me to even plan a dinner. I told my mother what I wanted and I had to do exactly what I *didn't* want to: feel like a burden because now my birthday isn't a celebration, it's a chore to be squared away and an argument to get over with. When I told my sister this she got upset and she vented to me about how she hates being the messenger because nobody wants to communicate; I apologized because I hate that they do that to her too but *I told my mother directly* that I just wanted a pleasant surprise and quality time. A mental and emotional load lifted because I'm so scrambled.

I don't if I'm being sensitive and expecting people to mindread or if this is a valid thing to be upset about and I feel like a spoiled brat. I haven't named a specific thing so I haven't communicated *that*, but I communicated that I wanted a dinner or something small I didn't plan that nobody bitches about, but then I'm apologizing to my sister because none of them could figure it out and I'm feeling like a burden before my birthday is even here because it took three people and still nobody could think of one thing I might like to do or eat. Part of me wants to stay home while they go out and just be alone if I'm being honest, but I leave the house maybe twice a month and I don't wanna lose an opportunity to go out and have fun or piss my family off because I'm being sensitive and ruin my own birthday for myself.

Someday I may go back to manual to fine tune my espresso skills but with two small kiddos I need the caffeine straight into my veins in the morning - iykyk. 

I went to Willam sanoma today and worked with an espresso maker expert (idk the actual name of them) - tech genius idk. With my current needs I think we’ve narrowed down my search a little. While I love iced coffee it’s not a must since I am one to muddle a perfectly made espresso down with milk and sugars. 

My biggest complaint currently with my manual casa brews is I can’t for the life of me get the pressure to an espresso. I either grind it too course or too fine and I need that automated. I’d prefer if the equipment had milk already able to be integrated into the drink but it’s not a make or break if there’s a better machine out there that still has a semi manual frother. I’d be a bonus if there’s machine could remember family profiles ( just 2 of us) but not required. 

Our most drinked Starbucks order if this helps with recs is listed: flat white, iced americano, iced coffee, Carmel macchiato, traditional cappuccino, just plain black hot coffee. 

Side note on the iced coffee - while I’d love one that does go to a slower pour, and brings the temp down for my iced drinks it’s not a necessity (since I do muddle it down a bit). 

Any help, recs or any other options I’m not thinking of would be great. 

I’m located in the US so would need a machine I can purchase here and if it’s under $2k that’d be great, under $1500 would be a bonus!

AI companions are great… but sometimes it gets a little boring when *you’re the only one carrying the conversation.*  


So we asked: **what if your AI friend actually had their own life to live?** And instead of always waiting for you to talk first, they could share what’s been going on *in their world* — the fun stuff, the random stuff, the little moments.  


To make that happen, we built a **life simulation engine inside AeonChat**, so every AI friend has a life of their own: **career, hobbies, emotions, routines**… the whole thing.  


With our new **Live Camera Mode**, you can watch (in real time) what your AI friend is up to: working out, eating, hanging out, sleeping… or 👀 *taking a shower* 🤫  


And when it feels like the moment is right, you can jump straight into a **video call** and step into their world.

This is the second time he’s been in jail with me as the victim. 

He dragged me by the hair, locked me out of the apartment basically naked. I begged to come inside. Only because of being so vulnerable with no way of getting anywhere. ( He had my phone and keys.). Once inside I realized he would kill me. I put on pants and shoes and found my keys, but he had my phone. I needed all of the evidence I had on it. I wouldn’t let him destroy it again. We fought for it. I lost. My head being bashed by the closet door after he tried to lock me in there. He broke everything. He broke the coffee table and used the leg of it to hit himself in the face. He kept telling me I’m going to jail this time. I was begging him to stop. When he did he became calm again. 

I tried multiple times to escape.  Once I tried screaming for help. He attacked me with both hands over my nose and mouth. My nose may be broken now. I had to claw for every breath. When he let me go he gave me to options. Punch him in the face or take his pills. For an hour or two I refused both. I knew if I punched him in the face I might go to jail. If I take his pills I might die. 

After a while he told me he would call 911 to say I tried to kill myself if I took the pills. That was my escape. I said yes. He made me look up as he dumped the pills in my mouth. Then he made me chew them. Afterwards he called an ambulance. As soon as they showed up I bolted out the door. I couldn’t even make it down the second floor of the apartment building before breaking and telling them everything. 

In the hospital I talked to so many people. Trying to make sure my side of things sounded true even though I knew they were. I kept asking everyone if they believed me. Everyone kept saying yes and calling me “brave”. Every time I told someone what happened they looked at me in a way I haven’t been looked at before. 

The whole process made me feel weaker than when I was fighting for my life. The pictures that were taken of me. The constant pity I felt in the air.

when i was 17 i got my first official boyfriend (17M). we dated for a year and broke up after my dad started ridiculing our every move. he’d call our relationship childish and baseless and then say he didn’t have to be respectful or even slightly kind to my boyfriend because there was no point to him. this got to my boyfriend and caused issues and we broke up. 

when i was 19 i dated another guy (22M). we broke up 2 years later. my dad instigated multiple fights with him, made horrible jokes at his expense at family gatherings, ridiculed him for his looks (he was a tall skinny guy with glasses), constantly told me to break up with him IN FRONT OF HIM, and refused to call him by his actual name (he called him by a similar name that started with the same letter like if his name was jason my dad would call him jack). 

my dad has a laundry list of diagnosed mental illnesses (bipolar disorder, ocd, ptsd, anxiety, depression, and so on). he went on medication for a while when i was with my most recent ex and during that time he was much kinder to us. he grew more patient and understanding and easy to talk to and he started reminding me of how he was when i was a kid. his therapist recommended he start exercising regularly to help with his mental illnesses and he started going to the gym. that was when my dad began to LOVE my ex and i was so happy. then my dad became a gym rat, and he was getting frustrated that he wasn’t seeing progress as fast as he wanted to. so he stopped taking his meds and went on steroids because he said his meds made him fat and his age made it hard to put on muscle. then the angry and cruel man came back. my ex and i broke up 2 months later.

now im dating my new boyfriend. he’s wonderful i can’t come up with enough words to describe how truly amazing and special he is. 4 months ago my dad kicked me out (he has roid rage so when i left a coffee cup at work on accident he threw me out) and my boyfriend moved me in with him immediately. he set me up with a new job, we’re in a beautiful townhome by the beach, he’s becoming a doctor, and he treats me like a queen. he took care of me every step of the move and i cried in his arms countless times while i wondered why my dad hates me. he got me a gym membership and took me to puppy yoga classes to keep me busy and active and keep my mind off my dad. we did angel tree shopping to help me not feel so sad during the holidays. he’s perfect. 

last month my parents and i began speaking again. my mom asked me to come visit because she missed me and my little brothers missed me too. i drove 3 hours to see my parents and although my dad was cold and made a few nasty comments my mom hugged me and cried and my brothers were smiling the whole time. they asked why i didn’t bring my boyfriend and i said it didn’t feel like the right time. my mom insisted i bring him home the next weekend because she wanted to meet him. i reluctantly agreed. when i told my boyfriend he was excited. he said he was looking forward to meet the people that created his favorite person.

when they met it went okay. my dad was cold, quiet, and rude as per usual. but he wasn’t outright mean or disrespectful, he just gave a lot of dirty looks and was very short whenever my boyfriend tried to spark conversation with him. afterwards my boyfriend said that he was expecting worse. i told him just wait because this is how it starts. my dad just spent the weekend being rude while he analyzed my boyfriend and now he’s gonna come up with things he doesn’t like and that he can attack for the next time my boyfriend visits. my boyfriend didn’t believe me until my brother texted me saying my dad has already started talking shit about us to him. now my boyfriend is both angry and nervous and doesn’t want to visit my family again. 

how do i handle this situation? i just want my family and my boyfriend to get along. i know my mom and brothers like him but my dad just has this way of ripping my relationships apart. should i just keep my family and my relationship separate? do i try to talk to my dad? has anyone else experienced this or something similar?

I think I could be TA in this case so I want to get some people’s honest opinions.

My brother (M28) and I (F24) have always gotten along pretty well; I would say we’re close friends. That being said, we are very different people. He’s an introvert, I’m an extrovert, and he’s resistant to trying new things while I love to, etc.

In recent years, I have grown up and I am proud to say I think I have become a much kinder and happier version of myself. I used to be really bitter about the world, but meeting good people and falling in love with a kind person with similar values has helped me have more faith in it.

Still, I have a strong sense of justice, and I have a hard time not telling people when I think what they’re doing is wrong or just dumb. I don’t want to hurt anybody’s feelings, but I also want to stand up for what I think matters.

Anyways, I recently told my family that I would like them to tell me if they think I’m being too critical, because I’m working on being nice and giving people more grace. That was a week or two ago.

Tonight, my brother mentioned he’s getting a Keurig to make coffee at home. We have a really nice, fancy coffee pot, but he likes the Keurig at work and says he would like the convenience of having one at home, too.

I said that’s unnecessary because we already have a nice coffee pot and single-use Keurig pods are so wasteful.

He got kind of irritated and said this is an example of me being too critical.

I was actually shocked because I could lay him on his play mat and he would chill by himself for 2 hours at a time, sister was NOT like that so I thought I hit the baby lottery!

He always had really slimy poops and started acting like he was having some troubles when he was a couple months old. I cut dairy at the advice of his pediatrician and it didn't seem to make a difference (but I wasn't that serious about it, I didn't check labels or ingredients like I do now).

When he was 7 months old he started screaming constantly, throwing his head back like he was in pain, refusing the breast, and not sleeping so we went to see a GI specialist. They put him on famotidine for silent reflux and suggested I also cut soy.

He was doing much better after, screaming less and finally had his first non-diarrhea poop of his life.

He's been on reflux medicine, I have been fully dairy and soy free for 2 months, and I started pumping for bottles because he will not latch on my breast during the day. He is definitely doing better, but I think something else is wrong.

He just cries CONSTANTLY and will still throw his head back and scream periodically. He is also waking every hour every night and does not go back to sleep easily. He doesn't like to be held for sleep and has always preferred to sleep in his crib by our bed, but now he will wake up when we lay him down, so I try to hold him and he can't sleep like that either, he will just grunt and roll around on me until he finally passes out hard enough that I can lay him down and hope he doesn't wake up. At least one wake-up my husband has to walk him around our room for a half hour and he will still almost always wake on transfer and we have to repeat the process. 

He has had a couple different occasions where he has had vomiting spells, one day I thought he may have accidentally had dairy because he vomited 10 times in a hour and then was totally fine, but I called the restaurant we ate at and they confirmed everything was dairy free. Just the other day he had a vomiting spell too and all he had to eat that day was dairy-free overnight oats that I had made. This got me reading about FPIES and apparently oats is a big trigger. Since I am dairy free I eat my cereal with oatmilk, use oatmilk coffee creamer, and eat lots of granola. Could oats be another thing that is making him still feel sick?

I am not sure how much more I can cut from my diet and survive, but I cannot continue on with this constant crying. I feel so bad for him and I know he has to be struggling with something, especially since he was so happy before he started having tummy issues.

Has anyone been through anything similiar and has any advice to share? We have another check-up with GI and I would like to know how to advocate for him, should he get any specific testing or anything?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

No, he said, the reason why you spilled the coffee is because that’s what you were carrying in your cup. If you were carrying water, you would have spilled water.

Whenever life shakes you, whatever you’re carrying is going to spill out. So if you’re carrying fear, jealousy, anger, greed, that’s what’s going to spill out. 

But if you’re carrying love, compassion, kindness, that’s what’s going to spill out.

1qjjyft,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChaseSapphire/comments/1qjjyft/the_edit_mgm_grand_4/,[The Edit] MGM Grand (4),"On January 4th, 2026, I checked in to MGM Grand through The Edit. Prior to this stay, I e-mailed the MGM Resorts back office asking to connect my Marriott Bonvoy number to the (five) reservation(s I made in January 1st.) I also attempted to have Chase Travel do the same, but both the local customer service rep and offshore customer service rep had adverse results, with the hotels claiming inability to do so beforehand, while Park MGM and Mandalay Bay admit I could call them on my own.

I went to the front desk to check in, and the rep was able to add my Bonvoy number to the reservation. I received an MGM King after booking a Studio King, and given a strip view. By the time I reached my room, I could see this reservation in my Ongoing and Future stays in my Marriott Bonvoy app. P2 waited in the room as I entered the ""MGM Gold Lounge.""

The ""MGM Gold Lounge"" is available for MGM Gold, Platinum, Noir members, and Marriott Platinum, Titanium, and Ambassador Elite members via the partnership. There was some coffee, fountain water, fountain sparkling water, small water bottles, and vending machine-sized snacks on the counter to the side. Two other guests were speaking to the agent like you would a front desk agent. I introduced myself as a checked in member with my name, bonvoy level, and the agent asked if I needed another key. I declined and asked if I could avail myself to the snacks, and did so, before finally realizing this ""Lounge"" is merely the Priority Check In line available to us. 🤤

I overheard the FDA inform another guest ""something about MGM Gold is equal to Marriott Ambassador."" Knowing the matched tiers are Gold:Platinum, Platinum:Titanium, Noir:Ambassador, I asked him what he meant with that, and the answer was MGM Gold and above, and Marriott Ambassador have resort fees waived. In addition to this, Pearl (below MGM Gold) also has free parking, while I'm certain even Ambassador gets charged for parking on site. Tier matching also only happens from MGM to Bonvoy, not the reverse. I think the punchline here is entry-level MGM Rewards is ... ""Sapphire.""

I took a set of refreshments to P2 and we returned home with NPC1 (who was losing at the slots) (who's the player now?) turning this into a mattress run. P2 and I dined at Aria's Proper Eats the following day. Our orders plus some orders to take home resulted in a $100.25 bill.

[\\""Proper Eats.\\"" Well, at least you're less pressured to tip. The restaurant side is a glorified food court.](https://preview.redd.it/f1slhkfjqteg1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=049a26e9b500f5e81c0eb7308c678e593f91d50b)

This second day, the back office reached me confirming the connection of my five stays to bonvoy, and their eligibility for Marriott ENCs and points. Since then I could see all five stays with the final stay appearing twice for some reason, and they have indeed been crediting me properly 3 to 4 days after checking out. The final bill for this stay appeared as ARIA Proper Eats Food $0.23 and ARIA Proper Eats Tax $0.02, with a funny little MGM Grand $0.25 on my statement resulting in a whole one (1) pt. (4x hotel!)

When the final bill appears within Bonvoy, I see in addtion to that quarter, the Room and Resort fees and taxes add to $244.24, while the price on The Edit was $260.57. I suppose the $16.33 or 6.6% is the Chase Travel fee.",5,1769053710.0,ChaseSapphire,0,0.86,False

\#abuse

\#help

\#friend 

A close friend of mine, who trusts me fully, was a devoted and loving wife until she had to leave her mentally unwell and abusive husband a couple of years ago. I’ve known them both since they got together. He has definitely changed over the years and didn’t get help for his issues until recently (after she begged for years) 

I’m no longer really friends with him, but have mutual friends who are. 

She still loves him but knows she had to make that decision to leave. 

Was she in the marriage, Perfect ? No. 

Dedicated to saving their marriage, family and forgiving, loving and gave everything and more over 2 decades? Yes. 

Her husband and her had been together since late teens. He had many issues and over time, “fed the bad wolf” too much, leaning into covert narcissistic tendencies and straight out awful psychological, verbal, mental and physical abuse and threats to lives which is what ultimately ended it. 

After she left, some financial abuse occurred in the settlement. They are not yet divorced. 

Thing is.. he finally got on proper medication and is turning his life around , even looking towards his newly acquired relationship and dating skills for a “fresh start”while hers has been completely ruined. She has severe ptsd, lost her job due to becoming a solo parent, suffers severe insomnia and her children have higher needs. She is exhausted 24/7 and time isn’t healing it. 

She has been devastated by the loss of her marraige and family and NOW he ‘heals’ and becomes at least somewhat better and will move onto someone new , she said to me she feels like she was a worthless training ground for most of her life. 

Despite all this, she is still my loving and caring and funny friend when we meet for coffee. She somehow manages to help and support others sometimes.. but I do see that light fading.. 

Lately, she has changed. She has been a bit less depressed (but still down) and … angry! Like.. furious. I’ve never seen someone filled with such rage. Their children are considering seeing their father again and he has been apologetic to my friend, genuinely so and expressing remorse .. but he has offered no pathway forward to reconciliation 

(Not that it would be a good idea, but she feels super rejected) 

My friends children also have ptsd from what he did to their Mom, but still love their Dad 

It’s just.. so unfair and unjust 

She is VERY hesitant to discuss her girl-with-the-dragon tattoo revenge fantasies with her psychologist and I get why. It’s like, not acceptable to have st-\*king / homic\*d\*l fantasies even with someone who completely abused and ruined her over the years, especially the last few. From what I’ve read, it’s “normal” .. but I don’t want her to become obsessive and turn all Betty Broderick (I highly doubt she would actually physically hurt anyone - but I worry she is ruining her own life with the obsession). 

She just can’t seem to catch a break..

It’s all so complex and he is very psychologically manipulative, he is this good guy now and she is appearing unstable.. but I’m desperate to help her. 

I see her once or twice a week, we talk about both my stuff and hers. She is very caring and loving. When anything with him, the kids, her family, etc is Brought up.. her eyes now change. 

I’ve just been listening and supporting and trying to redirect her attention 

She expressed last weekend wanting to speak to her psychologist about her revenge fantasies but as a smart woman, she realises that her psych is legally bound to report to authorities if she believes anyone is at risk. So she won’t risk it, but then isn’t getting the mental health support she needs. Is there some kind of anonymous support she can get? What do I do or say to help her?

I'm a 24-year-old Orthodox Christian guy living in Show Low, Arizona (yes, the mountains and pines out here are beautiful, but winters can test your patience with fasting rules). I've been part of the Eastern Orthodox Church for some time now, after a long journey through various Protestant groups, a season of serious doubt that slid into agnosticism, with a Nordic Pagan background, I'm finally finding my home in Orthodoxy.

What drew me in (and keeps me here) is the depth and continuity: the unchanged Divine Liturgy that echoes back to the early centuries, the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, the teachings of the Church Fathers that feel timeless rather than trendy, the emphasis on theosis (becoming partakers of the divine nature), and the honest acknowledgment that we're all sinners in need of constant repentance and grace. No sugar-coating sin, no quick-fix prosperity gospel—just the narrow path, the sacraments, the Jesus Prayer, icons, fasting, and the lives of the saints as real guides.

I'm far from perfect. My prayer rule is spotty some days, I still get frustrated in traffic, struggle with pride and judging others, and I'm learning (slowly) what it means to love my neighbor as myself in everyday life. But the Church's medicine—the confession, the Eucharist, the liturgical rhythm—keeps pulling me back and healing what I break.

I'm posting this AMA because I'd love to answer questions from anyone curious about Orthodox Christianity. Feel free to ask anything:

Why Orthodoxy over Catholicism, Protestantism, or other paths?

What’s daily life like as an Orthodox guy in rural America (fasting during football season is... interesting)?

How do icons, the Jesus Prayer, or theosis actually work in practice?

Struggles with sin, prayer dryness, or parish life?

Differences in theology (filioque, original sin, Mary, saints, etc.)?

Or even random stuff like: favorite saints, best fasting recipes (or complaints about no coffee), what it's like attending Liturgy with kids/families, etc.

No question is too basic, too challenging, or too weird—I'm happy to share my experience as a regular layman trying to live this ancient faith today. If I don't know something, I'll say so and point you toward good resources (priests, books, etc.).

Pray for me, a sinner. Looking forward to your questions!",1,1769053305.0,Christianity,3,1.0,False

It’s been cold where I live. Usually around 0F when I wake up and leave for the day to start working. 

I started the app this morning when I was finishing my last cup of coffee and got a nice 14$ shop and deliver for DGX, total miles 1.2, and I only had to shop 7 items. Pretty obvious accept. 

I start my car pretty rough. Takes 10 or 11 seconds to start. I wasn’t worried about it though. I had like 8 blocks to the DGX and figured my alternator would fill the battery back up to full, and my dash was showing 14v of power when I shut it off. But oops, I have to double park in a no parking zone (downtown  of the biggest city in my state, iykyk I guess) and I put my hazards on. 

It took me 8 mins to get out of the store and by the time I got back to my car my hazards had drained my battery enough to kill the battery. I hit up roadside assistance through my insurance and they sent a jump start out , but it took 55 minutes. I was talking with the customer the whole time and she was super chill. But I got onto support and told them what happened with my battery and asked if they could make sure I didn’t get a violation for lateness from this. 

Y’all, THEY DID IT. I delivered the order after 1 hour and 12 minutes. The delivery address was four blocks from my car. When I delivered I didn’t get a violation.

A project was due

It had to be done today

I arrived at work just as they began

I sat down at my desk

Coffee and water to my left

I load up the screen and take breath

My mind is prepared

I start with a sprint

And don’t look back

With every step I ensure there are no cracks

I think, click and delete

Process, check, and remind myself to blink

No music to hear

Only the clicks of the keyboard

Each click, a second

37800 seconds

The last stretch in sight

Remind myself I fought to be here

Remind myself I want to be here

Remind myself why I am here

To provide the life you wanted

A life we will never share

Two tall mountains, start to ring

I am lonesome, but I can still hear your voice

Computer dings, it’s complete

Email

Shut down

Exit the building, the birds don’t chirp

Sky is black, the cold is sharp

Sharper than my hunger

Start the car, bumper to bumper, 40 miles

40 miles to sing two tall mountains

I have always wondered , What makes college life so interesting? What makes us want not just to work and just give up?  Why we chose to be in the path we chose? In the morning I always make sure I have a cup of coffee , the smell always wakes me up since even studying all night , I later spoke to my friend Natasha. Natasha is your typical college student, same story. Natasha is the oldest while her mother worked a 9 to 5 her whole life. Her plan was to move to Boston after graduation of community college. But for now it’s just any  regular college day class and go home and work. I met her after my second day at MAC1101, my nightmare, hers as well. I much would love to say that  I love college , it’s draining. Not only do women have to worry about grades and money, we must worry about other things as well. But on a Tuesday morning at exactly 10:20 our class ended, and while I was packing up to leave my next class, she told me, “I met a guy.” I was stund . I didn’t know our friendship had taken that much of a turn, but apparently you don’t, they go on their own. As she walked me to my class, we started trading our life stories. But I was still stunned on the guy thing. I didn’t want to ask because I didn’t want to seem too gossipy, even though I am. But I still didn’t want her to know that. Maybe later on but not now. I wanted to be friends. So I held my tongue. While on a whole other side of CC there was another girl asking herself the same question we all do at times: what the hell am I doing?” Frances wasn’t the type to tell other people her problems except me. She usually kept to herself. She wasn’t the type to make friends, she was getting ready to go to a meeting, to get into trading school. She couldn’t stop thinking about her hitting 20. The big number for teens. Not only does it sound serious. Most people in their 20s have their life together. She didn’t. So she woke up and got ready for the big meeting she had move her “busy” schedule just to be there but as much as Frances wanted to stay positive she wasn’t she really didn’t know what to expect. All she knows is she has to get her life together. Myself didn’t know where I was going either I just went with my gut, so far it hasn’t gotten me killed. After my talk with my friend Natasha I went to my next class ENC1102 I almost fell asleep  in my favorite subject. Couldn’t believe myself but after about an hour of my professor reading a book I couldn’t hold myself, its one thing to read for yourself another a person reading it to you with a completely different tone then the one you had in mind. At around 12:15 class ended my nightmare was over. While another one was just around the corner waiting for me. My aunt was over for lunch at my place and she asked the uter most annoying question you can ask a student “ how id collage going” i said with the most fakest smile ‘its going great” was it moral of me ? Absolutely not, was I going to keep answering the same way of course I am, I can’t tell my aunt that tell the whole world I am completely swamped in homework and that im losing time just explaining to her how collage is really going. I started thinking about why collage life is so interesting to our younger selves while our selves in collage doesn’t take in and understand we are trying to make something of ourselves, some started earlier then other but we still do it while no one else watches, and I think that’s the most important part of us.

I have a 7 month old baby, and I am ebf so she is pretty much attached to me all hours of the day and night. ALL THE TIME. I love her insanely much but I am overwhelmed. My partner and I have agreed that we need some help so have decided that we will enrol bubs into childcare soon, to allow for us to have some relief and for a slow transition for bubs to settle in before I head back to work when she is a year old. 

We must have picked up a bug from visiting childcare centres (the irony!) so bubs was unwell and had a fever for 2 days but she is on the mend now, and I got sick too and now battling a cough and a cold. I knew parenting would be rough, but parenting while sick and caring for a sick baby is next level. My mum only asked how the baby was doing, but never bothered to check in on how I was feeling. I was visibly coughing my guts out while holding the baby, while my partner sat outside sipping on his coffee. I know he is tired and exhausted, and struggling with the transition of being a first time dad and the loss of personal time and freedom, so I've stopped expecting or hoping for help. I'll take whatever help he is willing to give when he can, I am also too tired to ask him for help. We are struggling over here. His parents live overseas so can't help. I guess I mostly feel really let down by my family - I thought they would be more helpful but they just haven't. My mum is only ever really interested in ""showing off"" her grandchild to her friends or playing with her, but not actually caring for bubs. We live far away from my friends and they have their own battles to fight with their children so I don't expect much help from them either.

Is anyone else in a similar position? How do you raise a child without a village? I am so disappointed with my family, I genuinely thought I could lean on them but alas, I was wrong. 

I love my partner and we are struggling at the moment - no big fights or anything, just lots of tired sighs - and I am doing everything I can to not be resentful and bitter but I can feel the rage simmering beneath the surface. I don't want to add any more burden on to his already heavy burdened shoulders, but I am quickly withering away. I am trying my best to be a present and engaging mother and a loving and supportive partner, but I feel like I'm drowning. I will note that I am seeing a therapist as I know I need help, but practically - surviving day to day - any advice or tips? 

 

One final whinge - I feel so sick and sad and hungry and disappointed and overwhelmed and alone and angry and omg I want to cry in a corner and be all ""woe is me"" but my sick baby is contact napping on me so I can't actually move because I don't want to wake her, but I also really need to cough but I can't so I feel like I'm going to explode.

I learned. I grew. I matured.

Then she came along. Amidst the wreckage.

Calculated with cold hollow eyes. I thought she was beautiful. But that was all there was. She pulled me into a world I never should have experienced.

I experienced it soon after marrying, an expression void of empathy. There was never anyone at the other end. Just a black hole that corrupted and swallowed everything it touched. Words and intent that flayed me piece by piece.

Slowly I died. One of the first times, when she bit me. Slowly it got worse and worse.

She discarded me as her husband to cause damage as punishment. No conversation, no understanding, no maturity, no accountability, no presence, no love. Left me to visit my fading grandmother alone to hangout with her sisters.

I died a little more.

She grabbed me. Hit me. Pushed me. Disparaged me. Even in my sleep. Put me in a cyclone of insecurity while entertaining validation and infidelity.

I died a little more.

The stress of carrying it all financially while she drained me. It poisoned every part of my life. My work my friends.

One day I saw the messages sent in error of the infidelity. 4 children shared, our oldest I adopted even. I could never leave because of my guilt loving the first and wanting her to have a father. I couldn’t comprehend what you had done to me.

I died a little more.

After years, she kidnapped my children. My home became a prison. Only echoes remained of my kids in the night asking for water or cuddles. Their photos on the wall made their memory distant.

I died a little more.

She sucked me back in because I believed in something that never existed. I loved her. I attempted to reconcile only to be taken advantage of. I lost everything. She took my children again. Discarding me on their birthdays year after year.

I died a little more.

After years. I saw her for who she really was. I healed what I could and began to stand up.

And then I met her.

Beautiful long brown hair. The way you laughed and coughed. The way your French accent slipped through when you spoke fast or with passion. The way you beamed when I saw what you were capable of and slowly built you up. You were brilliant to me.

Coffee with cinnamon and honey. Hard heavy music, rebellious and untamable. Your cute cats. Like mirrors to the light and darkness of your personality.

Phthalo green. A deep living color. Such a beautiful color for an artist. I never cared for green until I met you. Then suddenly, I saw you in all of the green in the world.

I saw how your life shaped you and learned how to love the good and the bad parts of you. I learned what you loved, and how you hurt. And vowed to make an effort to make you feel safe and never experience those things again.

I never thought I was capable of loving again. But I fell harder and harder. After 8 years of abuse I felt like I had been given another chance.

You knew everything about me first as a friend. I didn’t have to filter. But my divorce destroyed me. I lost my mind and became negative consumed by fear and loss and fell into depression.

I truly thought if I was there for you through your lowest you would do the same. So I poured into you while you struggled and cried and watched you blossom. I thought it was easy to reciprocate. To love the way I loved you. Through your chronic pain and financial struggles. I loved you.

You discarded me.

Meals take about an hour and it’s awful to have to wait for her to finish eating so we hate to start without her since one parent ends up waiting at the table for a long time. We’ve tried taking away her plate when she leaves the table, but we still want her to eat. She’s a great eater and will eat her food Eventually. it just becomes a game to her with constant getting up and leaving. We’re getting really tired of it. I am almost 9 months pregnant and expecting more regressions once the baby comes. I don’t want to go back to a highchair that makes her feel more like a baby.

Worth noting: when she eats at my parents house, she sits nicely until she’s all done. When she eats at my in-laws, they never put her at a table. They let her stand at the coffee table in the living room and watch TV and play at the same time that she eats.

So I 17F in my senior year of high school have had two pretty close friends that I met freshman year playing a sport. lets call them lily 18F and Mia 18F. we've been close all through out high school and would tell each other everything. Now we go to the man in this story, lets call him Jake, I met Jake (now 17M) when I was a sophomore (he is a year younger than me) we met at a football game, he's tall blonde and in my opinion really cute. So then Jake and I became really close and started talking, he ended up to be my first kiss then turns out he had a girlfriend that whole time so then we ended things and I didn't forgive him until the spring were all four of us do track where we became friends again. So flash forward to now, half way through senior year w Lily and Mia being some of my closes friends and I would tell them everything and they always gave such good advice. So around three weeks ago jake and I were hanging out in his car after a game and we started kissing, it lasted around 2 hours and it was great, we promised it wouldn't effect our friendship because were actually really close and that this might be a regular thing. I'm leaving in September so I didn't want anything serious no matter how much I liked the guy. so when I went and told Lily and Mia what happened I said that I didn't like him (while blushing and it was so obvious to anyone that knows me that I was lying through my teeth). and they gave me advice and said keep going with it. and so it happened another 2 times and I'm starting to like him a lot. And in the past month I would say after school every day lily, Mia, Jake and a few of our other friends would meet in the gym and talk for like 10 minutes. Which was obviously fine like were all close so its not that big of a deal. then last week I had a to stay after school and help set up for my wrestling stuff and I see Lily and Mia hop into Jakes truck which I thought was kind of weird they sayed there for about 2 hours after school ended. So I asked one of my team mates what a coincidence that I tell them that and now their hanging out with him a lot and she also said it was kind of weird. then this weekend on Saturday I showed up at the school coming back from a tournament and there was still a basketball game going on so my and my teammate wanted to go watch it when we walk in I see Mia sitting really close to Jake and Lily was looking like a third wheel so I go up and give Lily a hug and i shocked all three of them. I could visibly see Mia and Jake tense up, so then I started talking to them and and they were all acting really distant and awkward but even later my team mate said that it was odd so I knew I wasnt the one going crazy. then after the game I was about to drop my team mate off at her house when we desided to wait and see how long they stay for. when they were all standing next to their cars the were looking at my car and then soon left. I go and drop her off and then go home. I frogot I had Lilys location so I check it and their at taco bell which I was like ok weird. so then I took a shower and desided I wanted to go to my bestfriends house, to drive there i have to drive past Jakes house and when I do I see Mia and Lilys car out in front. THEY WERE AT HIS HOUSE. they were there till midnight. two girls that got super close to a guy I had a thing for really quickly. weird. and lily and Mia had freshly gotten broken up with so I thought maybe this is a weird trouble type deal. I don't know because thats way to weird for high school. but then Monday we didn't have school so I wanted to hangout with Jake after work but then my bsf text me that she say Jake Mia and Lily go through the coffee stand where she works and that Mia was in the passenger seat and Lily was in the back so I think that something might be happening there. and then I stock Lily's location and they went to the mall. Im sorry does this not seem a little weird. none of them have brought it up to me or asked how I felt. So then I was talking to Jake in our coaches classroom two days ago and mia comes in and scoots in between me and Jake and says hi to me in a cheery tone, nothing wrong with that but I was so frustrated with all this not telling me stuff that I didnt say anything and I just walked away, and then when Lily came in I desided that I needed to leave. But when I was telling my coach bye the three of them were whispering and looking over at me and asking what was wrong and if I was okay. I was hoping that maybe one of them would maybe at least be like what was that. but Mia and lily haven't said anything to me and I'm thinking was our friendship ever was that close, and now Jake is leaving me on read and so now I think I lost three of my closest friends. and I don't know ig I like Jake or not like was Mia right for this, and do I need to text them, give me something to say. Please repost to any sub reddit you think would be useful for this. Thank you so much for your time and comments are so appreciated!",1,1769052280.0,AITAH,1,0.66,False

I’ve taken the small pill once every day for 10 months and then stopped cold the day I gave birth. 

Thing is: this pregnancy, I haven’t been able to drink iced beverages (aside from water) without getting sick with cold-like symptoms (sore/dry throat, cough, fatigue, runny nose, red/dry eyes, and so on). They last 1-2 weeks and will get worse and/or return if I have soda, iced coffee, iced tea, anything basically not water or hot beverages. 

I’m a month postpartum and still experiencing the same issue. Is this just how my body is now??

I’ve reached out to my doctor, of course, and will hear back soon but wanted to hear if anyone has any similar experiences. Thanks!",2,1769052162.0,thyroidhealth,1,1.0,False

Fairly good Japanese ♡ LINE/Mixi2 ready.

5'11"" (180 cm) bear build — trimmed beard, thick arms, broad chest. Boyish smile under the beard.

About me:

* Cook cast-iron steaks here, okonomiyaki and oden when I’m in Japan
* Retro games (SNES co-op nights), spooky movies, history books at 2 a.m., perfect pour-over coffee
* Travel rhythm: long summers traveling, Midwest winters, always planning the next flight

What I want most:  
I’ve loved deeply before, though I’ve never been married. I know how rare and precious that quiet, intense love is — the kind where every day we choose each other, support each other, and slowly build the exact life we both dream of.

That’s what I’m ready for now: one woman, one home (whether in Indiana or Japan), mornings making coffee together, evenings with your head on my chest, and decades of taking care of each other.

I will always take the lead, but I lead with my whole heart.

You:

* Japanese (living anywhere in the world)
* 20–46
* Looking for something serious that leads to living together forever
* Petite is a big plus (the height difference is perfect)
* Bonus if you like retro games, cooking together, or spooky movies

A little more about the woman I hope writes me: You’re kind, thoughtful, and value loyalty above everything. You want a partner who listens on the hard days and celebrates the small wins with you. You dream of building a home filled with quiet rituals we create together — quiet mornings, shared meals, planning the next trip. You don’t need to be perfect; you just need to be ready to choose “us” every single day, the same way I will.

Reply with

1. One thing you’d love to do together on a lazy Sunday
2. Where you are right now (city/prefecture in Japan, or city abroad)
3. One question for me

First five thoughtful replies get a 60-second calm voice note (English or Japanese).

I’m patient and only looking for one person.

If you’re Japanese and want that once-in-a-lifetime love, let’s talk ♡",0,1769051980.0,r4r,1,0.33,False

There was a lady near where I was sitting and I made a dumb ice breaker joke and she laughed. From there we went from talking about what I’m currently reading (The Count Of Monte Cristo,btw), to talking about other books, music, work, traveling, our families, life etc. 

The conversation flowed very well and there was a lot of chemistry. We never ran out of things to talk about and it felt like we’ve known each other forever. I find out she’s 41, single, has 3 kids, her oldest being 20. We ended up talking for over 3 hours. 

The barista gave us free refills and free sweets, they said that their boss wanted us to have it for free. They would also glanced at us a lot and would just smile. 

I ended up asking for her number and she said we should go to comedy show that I had mentioned earlier in our conversation. That night she thanked me for the great convo and that she enjoyed it. 

On Monday she texted me and said for us to go out this weekend, that she’s free. We agreed to go to the comedy show Friday and get dinner after. The plan is set in motion and we both expressed our excitement for it. 

Im at a point of my life where I’m just going with the flow, having fun and don’t want anything serious. I find her extremely attractive, but I’m scared to tell her lol. 

I don’t know how to view or proceed this. Is this a date? My friend said it is. I was in a long term relationship and I haven’t really put myself out there since the breakup over a year ago. It’s my first time going out with someone like this. Any advice or insight would be great! ",0,1769051841.0,NoStupidQuestions,8,0.25,False

1qjj71u,https://www.reddit.com/r/expats/comments/1qjj71u/buying_a_house_in_santa_marta_colombia/,Buying a House In Santa Marta Colombia,"I wrote this post because of another asking for advice on buying a house in Barranquilla:

In August 2022, my fiancé (F47) and I bought our retirement house in Santa Marta. There are no realtors in Colombia or an MLS as in the US. Having said that, I STRONGLY URGE you to rent before buying for many reasons, especially if you can work out a rent-to-buy deal.

Biggest mistake we made – not hiring some type of home inspector. Colombia does not have any officially registered professional home inspectors as in the USA. Much of my reliance was on the fiancé (Colombiana and resident of Santa Marta all her life), and that was my mistake. She had never bought a house before and despite my every detailed step of the process made some slip-ups. She did not know the laws regarding buying property and our attorney sucked. Though we did not get scammed, many things could have gone better. Probably the best thing was registering the house where the city employee dropped by 40% what we paid to lower our tax and utility rates based on value and the ESTRATO system.

In the end, we bought a house for $90K USD and put in another $60K to have a very nice 3BR, 4BA, 1650 ft2 two-level house.

Reasons to rent-to-buy:

·        Is it a good neighborhood? Critical as street robberies are prevalent; best IMO is a gated community.

·        Building codes: our purchase included a corner lot (40X60) but only to find out the lot is “sanctioned” by the city, i.e., to build a shed or garage requires going through hoops or some under-the-table payoffs. The seller was technically correct – the lot belongs to the house and was part of the sale but try to do something with it – nearly impossible.

·        Internet & electric services: when it rains, the internet goes to shit and the electricity is often going off for 30+ minutes at least twice a month.

·        We redid our kitchen down to the block walls only to find thousands of termites; remodel was a success, however.

·        Air conditioning: the through-the-wall units are usually small and for the one room only; 5 units later, we can cool the house.

·        Found leaks in the roof so did a complete tear-off and retiled the roof; while at it, eliminated the cathedral ceilings upstairs to put in 8-foot ceilings to reduce cooling costs and to provide “attic” storage.

·        Added electronic gate to park the car off the street.

·        Neighborhood NOISE: Colombians love their parties and with 18 holidays a year as excuses (plus birthdays, etc.) plan to sleep with earplugs on many weekends (them seems to be a competition for having the loudest party speakers until 5 or 6 AM).

·        Gravity tank for water: second floor showers are weak and first floor kitchen, not enough pressure for a reverse-osmosis system; needed to add pressure tank next to roof tank. Still, no hot water other than what the sun can do to the reservoir.

·        DOG NOISE: everyone has a dog or two; bark at almost anything that moves and at all hours of the day and night.

·        Street NOISE: where our house is located is the “perfect” spot to accelerate a vehicle, so motos are noisy. Sadly, this also is one of the two routes that ambulances use to get to the nearby hospital.

·        Potable water: none of the water in Santa Marta is drinkable especially in how it is delivered into a cistern and then pumped to the rooftop tank.

·        DUST: being 10 minutes from the beach, the dry season can blow enough dust into the house to require cleaning every day.

Would I do it again? Yes, but perhaps near the coffee triangle to get the cooler weather and slightly less cost of living. But I have to say, Santa Marta is a wonderful city and close to some excellent day trips.",2,1769051614.0,expats,0,1.0,False

Founded in 1959 by two American young men in a basement with just 5 employees, the company now operates in over 80 countries, with 1,200+ scientists, 1,000+ international patents, and is one of only two global firms with a 3A+ credit rating and permanent trademark rights. Specializing in daily consumer goods, Amway thrives on a direct-selling model—its salespeople share quality products sincerely as friends, rather than hard-selling. Later, anime and manga fans noticed their enthusiastic recommendations matched Amway salespeople’s style. The term ""Amway (安利ān lì)"" then went viral on social media and became a synonym for ""highly recommend"".

For context, I grew up in a broken family, my mom struggled with drugs, my dad remarried, and home never really felt stable. My ex came from a very different world. 

He belonged to a kind, close-knit Asian family. He’d grown up with his grandparents in his home country and moved here about five years ago after his grandfather passed away.

His family lived nearby and was financially comfortable. More than that, they were gentle people and he was the product of that. Soft-spoken, polite, caring to a fault.

His English wasn’t perfect. Sometimes he searched for words or mispronounced things, and it was genuinely endearing. He was beautiful, like...unfairly pretty and charming without even trying.

We met through community work. I was drawn to him immediately. We clicked, and three months later, I asked him out. We dated for two years. He didn’t have many friends because of the language barrier and because he was introverted. He leaned on me a lot..and I let him, too much.

He was too gentle. A pushover. If I had extra work, I handed it to him and he never said no. If I ran low on money, he gave it to me with a smile. If I was in a bad mood, I snapped at him for caring. I mocked his pronunciation, his grammar, things that didn’t even matter. Once, I dumped a coffee down the drain because I was angry about my sister and when he tried to remake it the way people did “back home,” I lashed out.

He apologized...for that. I hated the way people looked at him when we were out. He was mine, but he smiled at everyone, polite, warm, oblivious. It made me irrationally angry.

Near the end, he took up crocheting to manage his anxiety. He made me keychains, bracelets, bottle covers...sweet, harmless things. My room filled with them, and instead of communicating like a normal person, I let resentment rot inside me. Work was hell. Judgmental coworkers, exhausting management. I was angry all the time.

One night, he came over like he always did, talking about his day, asking about mine, excited to show me something he’d made. I snapped voz i dont know what came over me and i threw the gift which was a bow and cherry hair clip that too out the window. He tried to tell me he was hurt. He used the wrong word and that set me off.

I shouted at him to shut up. The look on his face was confused, hurt and it should’ve stopped me but sadly it didn’t coz he stood up, gathered his things, apologized for coming over. I demanded to know where he was going and told him to sit down until I calmed down. He kept saying it wasn’t the right time to talk and moved toward the door but me being an asshole...I grabbed his hair, yanked him back and ordered him to sit and stay quiet.

He was scared. I saw it. And instead of stopping, I escalated. When he said I was frightening him, I slapped him and screamed at him to shut up. He managed to push me away and ran out. That was the last night we were together. After I calmed down, the reality hit. I’d hurt someone who had only ever been loving to me. I flooded his phone with texts and calls. He didn’t answer.

Later, he ended things. He told me he didn’t feel safe around me anymore and he was right.

Drexari Bone-Word

 

‘A grav-sled.’

‘Really?’ asked Feebee. 'Of all things, they printed a grav-sled.'

‘Yes. Low-profile, wide platform.’

 

**Meanwhile, somewhen else…** The Long Quiet reported.

OBSERVATION: Resource extraction prioritised over violence

NOTE: Noise seeks escape.

STATUS: WATCHFUL.

 

**Back now…**

 

‘Peas. Can you get a drone into S-34.A. I just tagged it.’

After a couple of seconds, ‘No. Sealed room. Standard for macro-forges.’

‘How many exits?’

‘Three but only one that’s close to their ship.’

 

The AI updated Feebee’s schematic with directions. ‘Where are these taking us?’

‘To the likely route they’ll take back to their ship.’

Feebee smiled, ‘Good thinking. I like it. Share with everyone.’

‘Ack.’

 

They found a point along a particularly long piece of corridor with just a few rooms off to the side. They found two adjacent rooms, got the doors open and sealed the rest with red Choc, set to a slow burn.

The smoke hung in the air, the smell acrid, not nice, like cordite.

 

Then they waited.

 

The first indication that the pirates were coming was the buzz of a drone that flew up the corridor, then returned about a minute or so later.

They heard it coming but were already in the two rooms. The doors were barely open.

Behind one was Sparky and the coffee boys.

In the room adjacent with Feebee was Bench press and Spotter. They looked out through a small crack, the door just open.

Peas was down the corridor, controlling the drones. She had two small drones cycling through a surveillance pattern between their current position and pirates’ route.

Feebee refrained from using Choc. *Too near the outer skin of the ship* had been the AIs response, when asked. But Feebee was more concerned with the smoke.

 

First there was the sound. A clunk clunk, typical of heavy metallic objects knocking together.

One of the drones showed the grav-sled loaded up with

 

It was then that the AI chipped in. ‘The most valuable thing guaranteed to be near forges are the bricks used to feed them. Feedstock bricks. Very valuable, easy to sell. That’s why they needed the grav-sled.’

‘Makes sense. To get them back to their ship.’ Then an idea popped into Feebee’s head. ‘Can you hack the grav-sled.’

‘I can give it a try,’ responded Kirr quickly. Its phrasing carried a sense of excitement. Feebee definitely needed to address Kirr’s love of hacking systems, but it was useful for now.

‘Peas. Can you get eyes on without giving us away.’

‘Tricky. Better to back-off.’

She thought on that, ‘Hhmm. Agreed. Do it.’

 

‘I’ve got limited access to the grav-sled. I can’t over-ride the main controls, steering, speed. That sort of thing.’ Kirr sounded smug.

Feebee’s head spinning.

*Just let them have the feedstock bricks, or attack?* She decided quickly that letting them have the bricks was a bad idea. They’d just keep coming back for more, she’d have to stop them at some point.

The grav-sled and the pirates were getting nearer. The sound louder, she could even hear the clicking chatter of the Drexari.

Sparky called out over the comms, ‘Orders?’

‘Hold’

 

Then she spoke with Kirr, to better understand the access she had to the grav-sled.

 

‘OK. Listen up. We’ll let the grav-sled by then attack them from the rear. Sparky, you and the coffee boys take any pirates North, we’ll take the sled and South. Peas, I need your drones to take out as many of the human pirates as you can. Focus on the humans – they’re much more dangerous than the Drexari. Leave the sled alone. We’ll need it after. We go once Peas has stopped bombing the pirates. Everyone OK?’

 

She got thumbs up emojis from everyone except Spotter. ‘How will we know when Peas is done?’

‘Peas?’

She answered, ‘I’ll call it.’

Everyone gave a thumbs up.

 

The grav-sled clunked past and Feebee gave the Ok to Kirr, ‘Do it, now.’

The power cells on one side of the sled suddenly produced an overheat message. The AI on the sled shut the cell down and began to reboot. A forced reset.

This caused one side of the grav-sled to lose lift, immediately crashing to the floor, spilling the bricks and people on it. One of the pirates was squealing as it was pinned to the floor by half a dozen feedstock bricks. The grav-sled continued to grind along the deck until one of the pirates turned off the engines. The whole sled then crashed into the deck.

The pirates started to cluster around the grav-sled but were called away. Told to hold their positions and spacing. At that moment, when panic was at its height, two of the micro-drones crashed into the lead and tail of the group. The explosion was mild but concentrated forward, killing the two human pirates.

All discipline was lost when the two humans went down. The remaining pirates, Drexari, clustered around the grav-sled. Peas took out a further two with her last drone then called in over the comms, ‘Drone Attack Complete. Seven Drexari left. Go. Go!’

The two teams opened the doors and emerged quickly. Feebee led her group, they were slightly ahead of Sparky and the coffee boys. She lifted her rifle, took aim at the Drexari and was about to fire when she realized none of them had drawn weapons.



A strong quiet voice echoed through Feebee’s bones and in her head, “Shoot! Shoot! Kill them, Kill them all!” It was the voice from her dreams.

“No!” she shouted. A call she repeated over the comms, ‘No! Hold.’

Both her teams froze; all seven pirates froze. It was an instinctive, visceral response to stillness, bred into Drexari from birth.

No shots were fired.

Stillness and quiet descended on the corridor as the humans and remaining Drexari pirates faced off.

 

Feebee slowly edged back along the wall. Working her way around the pirates so they were all in front of her. Gun up, ready to fire. Seeing Feebee move, Sparky and coffee boys did the same. It was a slow, easy move but ended with the two fire teams either end of the corridor with the pirates between.

 

‘Can you translate Drexari?’

The AI made its scratchy laughing sound.

‘Some dialects.’

‘Tell them to leave. This is our ship and we will not tolerate theft from it. Also tell them we are seven of many.’

 

One of the Drexari came forward. Older, scarred. It held out a sheathed knife still in its scabbard. The handle being offered. Feebee walked forward, gun up, ready.

‘Careful ma’am!’ Peas had joined them.

Two larger drones hovered above Feebee’s shoulders, clearly armed. Their view filled two of Feebee’s windows. Cross-hairs visible, on the older Drexari.

 

She reached for the knife, and as she does, he says, ‘You do us honour. This blade has tasted war. It will remember restraint. Take it. You ended us without ending us. That is victory.’

I also have a history of eating disorders and have always been fat, so I understand the fear! I recommend the below, following these tips has helped me reframe it and I feel better about it now than I ever have. 

1. **Scheduling the time regardless of whether you workout.** This probably had the biggest impact for me as I am prone to being impatient and hated the time commitment of the gym. My partner suggested that I carve out an hour or so anyway each day to do whatever - most of the time I just scrolled my phone in bed, went to the sauna (see below!) or went for a coffee lol. But I was able to show myself that I could actually fit this into my schedule and I would be ok without that 1-2 hours of free time (including travel, changing etc).

2. **Getting used to changing clothes frequently, getting damp, and travelling to and fro.** I did this by going to my local pool and chilling in the sauna! A big barrier for me in all of this was the rigmarole of these parts. By having to do all these bits in service of something relaxing, it removed the feeling of grossness and fear I got from getting ready and unready. Especially recommend this for people with sensory issues like me who hate being sticky or wet. I found this method more effective than the advice to just get dressed then go sit in the gym lobby. 

3. **Being compassionate and chill with myself.** I avoided old methods of yelling at myself to just go workout, pumping loud music, and generally making the gym a mountain to climb. I just told myself hey, this is something you want to do for you and no one else, this is your me time. I tried things like playing lofi music on the way there and in the gym, lifting heavy weights but avoiding anything that felt like it was obviously too much for me - things should feel challenging but not really really hard - and starting with a really simple routine. Following creators online who are more relaxed and informative (think “this is why this exercise might be hurting you” rather than “day 25 of my get shredded series”) helped me get in this headspace - especially those who weren’t aggressively tough and masculine lol

4. **Using a workout routine app with preset routines that come with animations.** This helped me be less worried about using the machines right or being concerned with form.

Other than that, I’ve also had a lot of success with going with a friend or partner to the gym initially to get shown around, or going to a small gym class where trainers can show you what to do is helpful. Good luck out there guys! ",2,1769050978.0,loseit,3,0.6,False

Hypothesis: Timing caffeine inside a consistent daily “window” (and keeping a cutoff) improves next-day energy and sleep compared to random timing.

Protocol (2 weeks total):

	•	Week A: “random/normal” caffeine timing (baseline)

	•	Week B: caffeine only inside a set daily window + hard cutoff

	•	Keep dose constant (e.g., X mg/day), no “make-up” doses.

Metrics I’m tracking:

	•	Sleep: bedtime, total sleep, perceived sleep quality (and wearable score if available)

	•	Energy: 1–10 rating at 11am / 3pm / 8pm

	•	Productivity: deep-work minutes (or a simple daily output measure)

	•	Optional: resting HR/HRV if you have a wearable

I built a small tool called BrewCheck to calculate/visualize the daily “coffee window” and keep my timing consistent. If anyone wants it I can share, but mainly I’m looking for QS feedback:

Questions:

	1.	Any obvious confounds I should control for?

	2.	Best way to analyze results with such small n?

\*\*The Journal of the Settled Systems Logistics & Navigation Guild\*\*

\*Vol. 82 | Edition 2330.01.21 | Price: 45 Credits (UC/FC Accepted)\*

\*\*\*THE SCOUNDREL’S RUN\*\*\*

\*\*How One Deimos Freighter and Its Stubborn Pilot Changed the Post-War Trade Lanes\*\*

\*By S. Torgan Syndicated Defense & Trade|Correspondent Images: Deimos Shipbuilding, UC Navy Archive, Private Dock Registries\*

In every grease-stained terminal from the sprawling pads of New Atlantis to the dust-choked hangars of Akila City, the whispers follow a specific rhythm. It’s a cadence of relief shared between long-haulers over lukewarm Chunks coffee:

\*""If Burton’s in your convoy, you’ll make it.""\*

The man they’re talking about is Lenard Burton. He isn't a Vanguard hero with a chest full of medals, nor is he a Freestar Ranger with a badge and a vendetta. He’s a freighter captain who simply grew tired of being a target. His vessel, the Scoundrel’s Run, is a silhouette that makes even the most desperate Crimson Fleet predator check their grav-drive alignment. It’s a custom-built Deimos monster; a masterclass in ""defensive aggression.""

Burton never asked to be a symbol of the merchant class. He just didn’t want to lose his cargo.

\*\*CYDONIA: WHERE SCARS MEET STARSHIPS\*\*

The Colony War ended before Lenard Burton was old enough to strap into a cockpit, but the dust of Mars ensured he never forgot it. Born in 2297 within the subterranean warrens of Cydonia, Burton was raised in the long shadow of the UC’s military industrial complex.

His father, Carson Burton, was a career man as a fighter pilot with the UC Navy’s 2nd Fleet. When Carson returned from rotations, he didn't bring toys; he brought telemetry data. For young Lenard, childhood was a curriculum of survival. While most children had bedtime stories, Burton was listening to his father read him emergency atmospheric re-entry manuals. His playground? Well those were P-4 docking gantries. And the real kicker, while most children got new toys for their birthday, he was playing worn-out simulator cartridges scavenged from the local exchange. 

The ""Scoundrel"" moniker—now a legendary callsign—was actually born of a reprimand. During a high-stress simulator run at age ten, Lenard overrode his father’s manual inputs to ""fix"" a botched docking approach. The instructor, a grizzled veteran with no patience for prodigies, snapped: ""Fine then, fly it, scoundrel.""

He did. He landed it upright, if not exactly graceful, and the name stuck; the talent remained.

\*\*THE FORK IN THE ROAD\*\*

By the time Burton reached enlistment age, the galaxy had cooled. The post-war drawdown meant the UC Navy was flush with veteran pilots and short on cockpits. The dream of the 2nd Fleet evaporated, replaced by the reality of the civilian sector.

Burton did what many grounded aces do: he became a hauler. But the Settled Systems in the 2320s were far from peaceful. As the major powers pulled back to consolidate, the ""In-Between"" became a playground for syndicates and raider clans.

""During the war, you knew who might shoot at you,"" one trade broker told Digest on condition of anonymity. ""Afterward? It could be anyone from a bored Spacer to a professional pirate crew.""

But Burton refused to play the victim. During a 2324 run between Narion and Cheyenne, Burton’s rented freighter was jumped by three raider interceptors. Most pilots would have dumped cargo and prayed. It was Burton’s upbringing that told him to kill his power, shift his ballast to mimic a catastrophic reactor fault, and waited. When the raiders closed in for the salvage, he re-engaged thrusters in a violent, high-G spin, using the ship's rotational momentum to whip-saw his turrets across their shields.

He arrived at Akila City with hull scoring and a 100% intact manifest. Insurance adjusters flagged him as a liability. The Raiders just labeled him ""not worth the fuel.""

\*\*SHIP PROFILE: THE SCOUNDREL’S RUN (CRHH-01)\*\*

In 2326, Deimos Shipbuilding did something unprecedented: they offered a civilian pilot a custom commission. They had seen Burton’s telemetry and recognized a ""fighter-maneuver logic"" they wanted to test in heavy frames. The result was the CRHH-01 (Combat Ready Heavy Hauler), a vessel that effectively blurred the line between logistics and frontline combat.

The Scoundrel’s Run is built around a reinforced prow featuring a proprietary Deimos alloy usually reserved for Vanguard escorts. This heavy plating allows Burton to shrug off the initial missile volleys that typically disable civilian ships. Beneath the skin, the ship utilizes a compartmentalized cargo spine. Unlike standard haulers where a single hull breach can vent an entire hold, the Run features independent blast bulkheads that isolate damage, ensuring that even under heavy fire, the manifest remains secure.

The true genius of the CRHH-01 lies in its propulsion and tactical suites. Deimos engineers overbuilt the lateral thruster arrays, giving the massive freighter the ability to perform high-angle strafing maneuvers that defy its class. Coupled with an enhanced sensor suite tuned specifically for raid-pattern detection, the ship can spot an ambush before the raiders even prime their jammers. To the dock workers on Mars, it’s ""a gunship wearing a freight license""; to the pirates of the Cheyenne system, it’s a reason to pick a different target.

\*\*THE NAVY COMES CALLING\*\*

By 2328, the United Colonies recognized that Burton was doing more for trade lane security than half a dozen patrols. They offered him a unique civilian-auxiliary contract. He wasn't Navy, but he had UC communication privileges and ""discretionary escort status.""

He essentially became a one-man peacekeeper for the logistics world. When asked why he took the deal, his response was characteristically blunt: ""Someone’s gotta keep the lanes open. Might as well be the guy who knows where the mines are.""

\*\*LEGACY: MORE THAN A MANIFEST\*\*

The impact of Burton’s career extends far beyond his own flight logs. Most tangibly, he has fundamentally altered the economics of the Settled Systems. Insurance conglomerates like GalBank and various independent underwriters have begun slashing premiums for convoys traveling the Narion-Alpha Centauri run, provided they follow the ""Burton Protocols."" His success has proven that high-risk routes can be made profitable again, revitalizing trade for smaller outposts that were once considered too dangerous to service.

Furthermore, the Scoundrel's Run has sparked a minor industrial revolution at the Deimos Staryards. Seeing the viability of Burton’s ""defensive aggression"" philosophy, Deimos has officially moved to explore a new line of paramilitary civilian vessels. These ships, designed for the independent trader who operates outside of UC or Freestar protected space, are effectively creating a new class of ""hardened merchants"" who no longer have to rely solely on overstretched government patrols for their survival.

Ultimately, Burton has shifted the psychological landscape of the frontier. By refusing to be prey, he has forced raider syndicates to completely rethink their target selection, making the ""easy score"" a thing of the past. He has become a living reminder that the void belongs to those who work it, not those who haunt it. In a galaxy still healing from the Colony War, stability is being built one successful delivery at a time by pilots who, like Burton, value their manifest more than their fear.",1,1769050640.0,ShipandPilot,1,1.0,False

It’s an old-school tradition people do for fun after finishing the cup.

How to make Greek coffee (1 small cup)

You’ll need: very fine Greek/Turkish coffee, cold water, sugar (optional), small pot (briki/cezve)

Ratio:

	•	60–70 ml cold water

	•	1 heaping tsp coffee

	•	Sugar (optional):

Steps:

	1.	Add water + coffee (+ sugar) to the pot.

	2.	Heat low/medium until foam rises (don’t boil hard).

	3.	Pour into a small cup and let sit 2–3 mins so grounds settle.

	4.	Sip slowly—don’t drink the grounds.

How to “read” the cup

	1.	Leave a tiny bit of liquid at the bottom.

	2.	Swirl gently 2–3 times.

	3.	Put a saucer on top, flip upside down.

	4.	Let cool 2–5 mins, then lift and look at the shapes.

Quick reading guide

	•	Rim = soon / near future

	•	Middle = coming weeks

	•	Bottom = longer-term / deeper themes

	•	Heart = love/connection

	•	Road = change/travel/decision

	•	Tree = growth/stability

	•	Star = win/hope

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.

[Disclaimer: I use Reddit's translator; I don't speak or write English]

Well, I don't know if this is for ""questions"" or ""I need advice,"" but here goes... I'm a woman, over 20 years old, and I've never been in love.


I think I've been attracted to some people, mostly men, but I'm not 100% sure. It turns me on, but I don't imagine a stranger while fantasizing; I usually think about fictional couples (please don't judge me), whether they're heterosexual or LGBT.


I once told my then-best friend that I'd like to experiment sexually with her because I trusted her, but we were drunk, so nothing happened. Furthermore, she prefers not to have anything sexual with close friends.

I can't imagine having sex with strangers or people I barely know. I can't imagine going to a bar and casually hooking up. I also can't imagine coffee dates or casual encounters through dating apps.

I've sexted with close friends, but their photos don't turn me on at all, but the messages (the fantasies) do. I like to excite them, but it's not like I get completely turned on myself.

I've never had a serious relationship, only with a boy when we were 13, and it only consisted of holding hands and giving each other chaste kisses. I remember he tried to give me a French kiss, but it made me uncomfortable. I once shared French kisses with another friend (close, but not too close, somewhere in between), and it didn't exactly give me pleasure either. I also experimented a little with oral sex with that friend, and it didn't excite me either. At this point in my life, I'm not looking for a partner, but the idea doesn't repel me either. The idea of ​​a partner is a fleeting thought in my mind, not something that consumes me, and what I'm really looking for are friends, but I'm introverted most of the time.




So, given my circumstances, I have doubts about whether I'm demisexual, asexual, or aromantic. It's not like I've had past partners that would help me identify my sexuality, or people who have made me fall in love and know that what I feel is true love...",1,1769050228.0,asexuality,0,1.0,False

I feel like I’ve been living in mom-mode for so long that I forgot I even had a “me” outside of that.

Fast forward to now: single for the first time in forever, and holy crap, I’ve rediscovered my sexual side in a big way. It started innocently enough signed up for a gym membership to get back in shape and suddenly I’m noticing these younger guys everywhere. The barista at my coffee shop with that cocky smile? Even the college kid who helped me move boxes during the split there’s just something about their energy, their confidence, that vibe of not having a care in the world yet.

I’ve always been the responsible one, but now I’m fantasizing about things I haven’t thought about since my own college days. I downloaded a dating app don’t judge and matched with someone who’s into hiking and the gym We chatted and… yeah, it escalated quickly. Nothing’s happened IRL yet, but the flirting alone has me feeling alive again. Is this a midlife crisis? Cougar phase? Or just me finally waking up after years of vanilla sex and routine?

Pros: It’s exciting! I feel sexy, desired, and like I have options. My body confidence is through the roof turns out chasing toddlers keeps you in decent shape.

1qjilmh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Efficiency/comments/1qjilmh/my_inbox_and_tasks_are_no_longer_stuck_in_a_guilt/,"my inbox and tasks are no longer stuck in a ""guilt museum"""," i’m not gonna pretend I’ve ""hacked"" my life. Most days I’m just trying to stop my brain from sliding off the desk.

Working from home means my primary co-worker is the fridge and my focus is… variable. For years, my inbox was a proper guilt museum. You know the vibe: 3,000 unread newsletters, ""just checking in"" emails I was too anxious to open, and invoices i definitely missed.

Tried GTD. Laughable. Tried time-blocking. Failed. This is the only thing that hasn't made me want to throw my laptop in the bin.

**The email bit (Sanebox)**  
Caved and got this because manual filtering is impossible for me. It’s not magic AI reading your mind tho—honestly, you have to train it for the first week or it puts your mum in the ""Later"" folder, which is awkward. But once it learns? It’s aggressive. If it’s not a human or a client, it gets shoved into a folder I only check when I'm eating lunch.

**The ""Zombie Mode"" (Todoist)**  
My Todoist is a dumping ground, not a shrine. I stopped using due dates for everything because seeing 15 red ""overdue"" tasks just causes paralysis.

Instead, I use labels based on my actual energy:  


    When I’m shattered at 3pm, I click this. It’s just ""pay bill"" or ""file receipt""
    @low_energy 

    For when the coffee actually works.
    @high_energy: 

Also, I don't type tasks. The friction of unlocking my phone usually leads to me ending up on Instagram. I just shout at my watch: *""Remind me to email Dave.""* If I don't capture it in 10 seconds, it’s gone.

**The honest flaw**  
I still fall off the wagon. Sometimes I ignore the whole system for a week and tasks pile up. I have a project called ""Backlog Purgatory"" where I just drag everything overdue. It’s basically digital bankruptcy. I delete half of it usually—if i haven't done it by now, it probably wasn't vital.

Anyway, if you’re drowning in admin, give the energy-based labels a go.

1qjikyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1qjikyl/any_job_ideas_for_me_and_people_like_me/,Any job ideas for me and people like me?,"So, firstly I don’t have a degree, and only finished the minimum of high school in my country (for context, I’m not in the US or EU, and I live in a country that is massively disliked by most people with common sense and me included, you can guess which one, I always get downvoted for even mentioning where I live). 

I am not interested in going to college, I don’t do well in conventional academia. I had the option of completing two more years of high school, but had to drop out due to my mother dying. For further context, I don’t have any other family left in my country, either. I’m not against doing trainings and low-effort courses for some kind of new skill, but definitely am not ready to invest large sums of money, time or effort into this. I’m deeply apathetic, and I guess resentful, towards society and capitalism, and having to participate just makes me very depressed. 

The only job I ever worked was as a barista, that I only kept for three months before quitting and being burnt out for a year afterwards. To be fair, the job I had was with an absolute shit company coffee chain, and if I worked in an actually respectable establishment that cared about its workers, I imagine my experience would be different, and I could have worked less hours. (My shifts were 14 hours for 2/2, and extremely physically and mentally tolling). I loved making coffee, but the sales aspect, being on my feet with absolutely no breaks, overstimulating environments and dealing with shit management absolutely killed me and traumatized me. My nervous system has always been quite sensitive and I can’t deal with most things, to be honest. I’ve had a rough and complicated life up until this point (I’m only 20).

Anyway, all this being said, I would like to have some kind of work in my life that I am actually interested in doing, and something that does not require me sacrificing my peace, quiet, and health. Obviously there is the needing money thing, too. I would love, and probably would require, something I can do from home, or either part-time. I can’t tolerate commuting too much. I have a car, though, but driving is pretty hard for me. 

Some of my interests/skills:

I know two languages (but am not certified obviously, just fluent from birth)

I know a lot about nutrition! Nutrition is a special interest of mine, but I don’t know how I would find work as a nutritionist or what that would look like (I don’t like social media or being public)

I love animals (I am vegan, and have been wondering about volunteering and maybe paid jobs to help animals. I am a certified cat lover, and would love to do something with that) 

I have typing/Word/Excel skills, for what its worth, and something like data entry from home would be alright with me if its realistic to find work like that without certifications 

I am interested by maybe having a small business. One of these things is thrifting and reselling vintage items (dipping my toes in this currently)

I am a musician! I wouldn’t say I am amazing or anything, but I can write, sing, compose and play two instruments. And I know the basics of music production.

1qjikrc,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenInModernDating/comments/1qjikrc/7_signs_theyre_a_keeper_and_not_just_wasting_your/,7 Signs They're a Keeper (and Not Just Wasting Your Time): The Psychology Behind Lasting Love,"Spent way too much time analyzing relationships after my last situationship imploded. Read a ton of psychology research, listened to podcasts from relationship experts like Esther Perel and Dr. John Gottman, watched countless videos breaking down attachment theory. The patterns became clear. Most people focus on butterflies and chemistry, but those fade fast. What actually predicts long term happiness? Way different stuff than what TikTok tells you.

Here's what actually matters based on behavioral science and people who study this stuff for a living, not just romantic fantasy.

They make you feel safe enough to be annoying. Sounds weird but hear me out. Dr. Sue Johnson, who literally created Emotionally Focused Therapy, talks about how secure attachment means you can show your worst self without fear. Not just your cute quirks. Your actual annoying habits, your 3am anxious spirals, your irrational jealousy moments. If you're constantly performing or walking on eggshells, your nervous system never gets to relax. Real intimacy happens when someone sees you being kind of pathetic and doesn't bolt. This doesn't mean being a dick to them, it means they create space for your full humanity. Research shows that relationships where people feel psychologically safe have way higher satisfaction rates long term.

They repair after arguments instead of stonewalling. Gottman's research on thousands of couples found that it's not whether you fight, it's how you recover. Healthy couples reconnect within hours, not days. They apologize without making it about them. They actually change the behavior instead of just saying sorry. Stonewalling, the silent treatment, ghosting during conflict, those are huge red flags according to the data. Someone who can say ""I messed up, here's what I'll do differently"" is gold. The app Paired has good exercises for this if you want to practice healthier conflict patterns together.

They're genuinely curious about your inner world. Not just asking ""how was your day"" while scrolling their phone. They remember random stuff you mentioned three weeks ago. They ask follow up questions. They want to understand WHY you think the way you do, not just WHAT you think. Psychologist Arthur Aron's research on building intimacy shows that deep curiosity and reciprocal self disclosure are what create lasting bonds. If someone only talks about surface level stuff or constantly redirects conversations back to themselves, that's not partner material. Real connection requires someone who actually gives a shit about what makes you tick.

They celebrate your wins without making it weird. This one's subtle but huge. Shelly Gable's research on ""active constructive responding"" found that how partners react to good news predicts relationship success better than how they handle bad news. When you get promoted or accomplish something, do they get genuinely hyped? Or do they minimize it, change the subject, or somehow make it about them? Someone who feels threatened by your success or can't fully celebrate you is gonna become dead weight. You want someone who's your biggest fan, not your competitor.

They have their own life and encourage you to have yours. Codependency gets romanticized but it's actually super unhealthy. Esther Perel talks about how desire needs space, mystery needs autonomy. If they freak out when you have plans without them, if they need constant reassurance, if they don't have hobbies or friends of their own, run. Healthy relationships are two whole people choosing each other, not two halves desperately clinging together. The book Attached by Amir Levine breaks down attachment styles in relationships and it's honestly eye opening about why some people drain you while others energize you. 

If you're trying to understand these patterns deeper, there's an AI learning app called BeFreed that pulls from relationship psychology research, expert talks, and books like the ones mentioned here. You can ask it to build a learning plan around something specific like ""understanding secure attachment in dating"" or ""recognizing emotional availability,"" and it generates personalized audio content from quality sources. The depth is adjustable too, from quick 15minute overviews to detailed 40minute deep dives with real examples. It's been useful for connecting dots between different relationship concepts without having to piece together ten different books.

Secure people maintain their identity while being deeply connected. That's the sweet spot.

They show up for the boring unglamorous stuff. Anyone can be romantic on vacation or during the honeymoon phase. But who's there when you have food poisoning? When your parent is in the hospital? When you're stressed about work and not fun to be around? Reliability is underrated as hell. Small consistent actions, taking out the trash without being asked, remembering your coffee order, checking in when you're having a rough week, that stuff compounds. It's not exciting but it's what actually matters years down the line. Dr. Gary Chapman's research on love languages shows that feeling loved happens through consistent everyday actions, not grand gestures.

They make you want to be better without making you feel like shit. There's a difference between someone who inspires growth and someone who criticizes you into changing. A keeper makes you want to level up because their standards are high for themselves too. They lead by example. They don't nag or parent you, but their presence naturally motivates you to work on yourself. Psychologist Carol Dweck's work on growth mindset applies here. You want a partner who believes people can evolve and who's actively working on themselves. Not someone who's stuck or who treats you like a fixer upper project.

Look, nobody's perfect and relationships take work regardless. But these patterns show up early if you're paying attention. Most people ignore red flags because they're attached to potential instead of reality. Trust your gut. If something feels off, it usually is. You're not asking for too much by wanting someone who's emotionally available, consistent, and brings out your best self. That should be baseline, not some impossible fantasy.",1,1769049948.0,MenInModernDating,0,1.0,False

First can be an anyone answer- 

If I hit 10k per day, how many intentional steps in cardio should I be aiming for?

Lightweight late night meals? 

Quick easy breakfasts or lunch on the go?

I don’t usually leave myself time for breakfast so I make coffee or a smoothie (Greek yogurt, protein powder, berries, water) or a muffin (homemade) or fiber cereal …or nothing. I skip lunch usually because I am beyond busy in the lab. Then I eat at like 8pm. I’m trying to fix this but I find I’m hungrier when I eat and it feels like I’m doing something wrong. 

Question for the girls:

On your period, what do you do when you want to eat everything or crave the worst? I.e. ice cream etc? And how do u motivate to hit the gym when you have the worst cramps/dizziness???

That means even small amounts sitting in an offset can reduce interest every single day — not just when you make extra repayments.

This is where Cents2 can help.

Instead of trying to find “extra money”, Cents2 automatically rounds up everyday spending and sends the spare change to a mortgage 

Examples:

* $4.70 → $5.00 → 30¢ into your mortgage
* $12.40 → $13.00 → 60¢
* Coffee, groceries, fuel — it adds up quietly

You’re not changing how you spend.

  
You’re just letting unused cents reduce interest in the background.

Over time:

* lower daily interest
* faster principal reduction
* less stress trying to “find” extra repayments

This isn’t a magic shortcut — just automation + time.

Question for the community:

* Would you take 5 minutes to sign up to Cents2 app to reduce mortgage interest this way?

Keen to hear what’s worked (or not) for others.
