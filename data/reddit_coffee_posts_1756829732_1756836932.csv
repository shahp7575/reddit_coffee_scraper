Hello nerds,

I'm on my first (and furthest) playthrough and I'm not sure if I'm missing something. For context, I've only played on controller and have no intention of changing that moving forward. Every time I want to remove something from the DD queue, I flick right stick to the left to focus the DD window and then scroll ALL THE WAY TO THE BOTTOM to get to my queue. 

Is there a way to focus that lower section more quickly on controller? If not, is there a way I can get this request over to Coffee Stain to recommend an improvement?

Hope this clears things up,

1n6qyuh,https://www.reddit.com/r/SanJose/comments/1n6qyuh/i_want_to_like_san_jose_but/,I want to like San Jose but.....,"I moved to San Jose 2 months ago, first time home buyers. I am struggling to like this new life. 

I lived in Fremont for 20 years before moving. Agreed that brain hates novelty and it will take me a while to find the same level of familiarity but I feel miserable these days. 

I lived near Central lake. The air quality, the views were fantastic. I could walk to Whole foods, trader joes, Mega mart, indian stores & coffee places. Costco, hospital, bart, Niles .....The freeway exits are easy to navigate and I felt safe driving. 

San Jose feels like 40% people want to drive at 45, 40% at 95 and i am just trying to survive in b/w. The shopping complex parking lots are crazy. I am 4 miles from airport, the air feels wrong. The water is the hardest I have experienced and my skin is constantly itchy. 

My water, PG&E bill has tripled. I feel lonely here. 

I am cutting all the slack I can to neuroplasticity but this is nothing short of misery right now. 

Do you have any suggestions for me?",0,1756836674.0,SanJose,1,0.4,False
1n6qys0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1n6qys0/should_i_record_her_or_not/,Should I record her or not?,"My mom has PWD, likely stage 4-5 and is staying with me. As I've mentioned before, she came to stay with me to get seen by a neurologist, in her area they were booked out like 6-8 months. She lives in a 3 story home, on acreage in a rural area. Her house is cluttered, dirty and dangerous. She is fixated on going home, which would most certainly result in a serious fall, perhaps death from the injury. She is in way worse condition now than when she left her house, however, according to her she walks just fine, she walks better without her walker and she wants to return to her old life, and also drive.  
Both my husband and her sister are telling me to record her, to show her how limited her mobility is. She walks bent over, her hand has a tremor, her right leg drags - this is all with a walker. Just picking up a cup of coffee and walking 5 feet to the coffee table is unpredictable and literally takes her probably 3-4 minutes to actually take the few steps, set down the cup, and then try to sit down which is really just a planned fall because she won't spend the extra time or effort to be careful before sitting.  
I'm concerned about recording her, I don't want to shame her or be MORE of the bad guy (I'm already the bad guy who is taking over her life) but there are signs that after today's appointment, a skin biopsy, things are going to escalate with her demanding to go home. I have POA and all the legalities are squared away but, she's still aware enough to make her own demands.  
Happy to hear the opinions of the group. I've told both my aunt and husband there's no guarantee this will change her mind about anything - and it might make it worse if she feels shamed by it.",1,1756836670.0,dementia,0,1.0,False
1n6qyj7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1n6qyj7/aita_for_ordering_a_drink_from_dunkin_45_minutes/,AITA for ordering a drink from Dunkin 45 minutes from closing?,"Friend and I are driving around in the evening and decide we want to stop somewhere for a snack and drink. Pretty much everywhere is closed but Dunkin is open until 9 so we decide to go there. We arrive at the drive thru at 8:15. (I never go to places right before closing but I thought 45 minutes was still a reasonable amount of time, especially since it was a drive-thru.) 

I order a decaf coffee drink. Barista in drive through gives me a hard time. She says they’ve already gotten rid of the decaf for the day and I need to order something else. I said I actually really want decaf because it was after 8pm so I don’t want caffeine. She gets huffy and mentions they’ll have to make a new pot of decaf. Eventually gives in and glares at me when I get my drink. 

I’m not trying to be the AH but I truly think 45 minutes is plenty of time to clean up a bit before close. If they didn’t want to serve past 8 they should close at 8. I do understand it can be frustrating to have last-minute customers but at the same time they do technically serve until 9, and this is in a college town where getting coffee at all times of day is considered normal.

Message from the owner:

It's time. For the past 10+ years, I've had one simple goal - to try and brighten a little corner in a little town. This Saturday, will be the final day, under my direction, that Stackhouse will operate. It's time.
This tiny corner of my tiny world - the corner of Main & 213 - has been a bright spot for me through many different periods of life. As an 18 year old coming to college, this space was my place to grow social wings - coffee, conversation with people different than myself. It was a place to play music. It was a space for me witness some artists who've indelibly helped hone my eyes see the good and the beautiful  in places I'd been to young and inexperienced to look.
This space has been a home. After I graduated, what is now the kitchen of Stackhouse, was my first apartment. It was also a delivery room where a stray dog I had taken in unexpectedly gave birth to 14 puppies - of which a pup and mother became two of this man's best friends. 
The space was a refuge during the turbulence and unknowing of my 20's - always a place to which I could return and know I was welcomed home. 
In 2015, all these experiences planted within me a deep desire to share this space, this kind of space in a tiny corner of the world where my influence and excitement seemed to find its home. 
With a lot of help, ingenuity and teamwork, I got to build something that for the longest time seemed like a fantasy - the first full service restaurant bar in Mars Hill. It worked - and it worked through the kindness and care of this community.
I have no idea what the future holds for this tiny corner. My sincerest hope is that another young motivated person can pick up the torch and advance the effort - it takes a community (and we are entertaining offers in the hopes that what's been built can keep growing!). Please reach out if you have interest!
All in all - this community has given me a gift - the gift to brighten the tiny corner that has been so life giving to me! That's special.
I'll let Ms Ella sing me out with my parting wish for all those who have graced us with your presence and patronage over the past 10 years.
Eternal gratitude and infinite thanks,

1n6qwbo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskGaybrosOver30/comments/1n6qwbo/im_stuck_int_he_closet_could_you_please_help_me/,"I'm stuck int he closet, Could you please help me find a way out?","Sorry for the long post but I feel I need some advice. I know for sure I am not straight. I know my desire for men is real and much much stronger than women. I am a very *emotionally oriented* person, almost demisexual and also due to years of pushing my feelings down I fear I have some level of *health anxiety* too. I never had any sexual connection with men or women. I’m 33 now, in the closet and the problem is despite knowing these things about myself and the fact that I want to explore, I can’t.

The easiest way is hook-ups, but I don’t feel comfortable with that. Finding a more serious relationship also feels difficult.

Ideally I want someone who has the patience to let me learn how things work at my own pace. But I know that’s kind of idealistic and not very likely to happen. I have Tinder and my profile says I’m looking for new friends, and I mention I don’t want to rush into anything. Among the few matches I get, most fade away without even messaging. The ones who do chat quickly ask for my number or social media. I don’t want to stay on the app forever, but I’d like to get to know someone a bit before moving off it. For me, chatting for 2–3 days and then meeting in a coffee shop feels right, and then if it goes well, we can exchange numbers or socials.

I feel like I have two options:

1. Stick to my boundaries and wait until I find the right person.
2. Change myself, which I don’t even know how to do. Just putting my real pictures on Tinder was already a huge step for me and took me some time to do it.

To be fully honest, sometimes I feel deep down I’m still afraid of being gay. I see a guy who’s cute and lovely and I can imagine being with him, but if it starts to feel real, I panic. **But** when I set my Tinder to women, it’s different. I see their faces and, while they’re pretty and nice, I feel scared in another way, like I can’t do it, like it would be strange.

With men, I feel more excited, more interested, more sexual, but I can’t get close. With women, I do feel some sexual attraction (very dependent on the person) , notice their beauty, or feel the energy, but I don’t know how to relate to it. I’m afraid that if I keep denying my true self and I probably somehow find a woman I can connect with, one day my desire for men will blow everything up.

That probably sounds like overthinking, but it’s all over my thoughts.

***So I’m kind of stuck. Do I dive in blind and risk hurting myself? Or do I wait for the rare person who can walk with me at my pace? Or is there some middle ground I can’t see right now?***

*Btw*, I am originally from the middle east (with all the traditional family and religious society challenges ) but moved to the EU for my PhD about a year ago. Since then, I tried reddit and Tinder to chat with guys and kinda fit myself in the community somehow, or at least not to stand idle. I realized there are very few guys online with mutual interests who are willing to be just friends (at least at first) and I can’t blame them.

Also, I am living in a small student town, there is no gay bar and the university has limited LGBT activities and those are usually filled with teens. I would probably feel alienated there, IF I can convince myself to go! also that affect the apps too!

**TL;DR:** I’m in my 30s, closeted, emotionally cautious, and have never had sex. I know I’m primarily attracted to men, but fear, past suppression, and a small social circle make exploring difficult. Hook-ups feel wrong, serious dating seems rare, and I don’t know how to start building gay life at my own pace. I would appreciate advice for safe, gradual explorations.",1,1756836522.0,AskGaybrosOver30,0,1.0,False

1n6qvoz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1n6qvoz/does_waterdrop_wdpfal_alkaline_filter_improve/,Does Waterdrop WD-PF-AL Alkaline Filter Improve Coffee Taste Greatly Review,"Testing out the Waterdrop WD-PF-AL Replacement Alkaline Filters has been an interesting journey for my household. The promise of clean, pH-boosted water sounded too good to pass up. With kids who are constantly running around and my own budding interest in healthier living, it felt like a no-brainer to give these filters a run. Turns out, there’s a lot to like here, but not without a few bumps along the way.

**Design That Blends In with Everyday Use**  
The design of this filter is one of its subtle wins. It doesn't scream, ""I'm a water filter!"" but rather sneaks into the pitcher seamlessly. The compact dimensions (3.11""D x 8.07""W x 5.47""H) make it an easy fit, even in smaller kitchens. Unlike bulkier options we’ve tried before, this filter’s lightweight build (just 1.3 pounds!) doesn’t require extra effort when assembling or cleaning. That was a win for me—I’m already juggling enough around the house without needing complicated gadget installations. However, it would have been nice if the material had a slightly more premium feel. While functional, it doesn't exude luxury.  

**See [Waterdrop WD-PF-AL] deals on Amazon now.**  

**Performance and Water Quality**  
Using this filter, I immediately noticed a difference in taste when drinking straight from the tap versus water that had gone through the filtration process. The six-stage technology truly kicks impurities out of your water, claiming to reduce everything from fluoride and chlorine to heavy metals like copper and mercury. While I didn't personally run it through a lab (who has time for that?), the reduction in chlorine taste is obvious—my morning coffee tasted smoother, less acidic. Even my persnickety spouse, who's hyper-picky about water taste, admitted it passed the ""sip test."" It lives up to its alkaline promise, delivering water with a pH range of 8.0-9.5. Health benefits aside, the punchier flavor was enough to win us over. 

**Advantages**  
- Improves water taste substantially (morning coffee fans, I see you!).  
- Robust six-stage filtration tackles a variety of impurities.  
- Adds beneficial minerals like zinc, calcium, and magnesium.  
- Quick and smooth flow rate at 0.3gpm—no waiting around for filtered water.  

**Downsides**  
- The filter lifespan, while decent at 100 gallons, feels shorter if you're used to larger-capacity models.  
- Design doesn't feel as premium as competitors in the same price bracket.  

**Who’s This Really For?**  
Honestly, I think this alkaline filter system makes sense for families or small households who enjoy clean-tasting water without a ton of hassle. It’s especially appealing if you’re a fan of mineral water but don’t want to keep buying expensive bottles or generating more plastic waste. On the flip side, if you're running a bustling household with six thirsty people, you might find yourself burning through these filters a tad quicker than you’d like.

**Product Contenders**  
Having previously used Brita and ZeroWater filters, this Waterdrop filter stacks up admirably in some aspects. For example, ZeroWater leans on its TDS-removal testing as a selling point, but its overly crisp-tasting water removes almost too much. Brita, trusty as ever, provides affordable filtering, though it lacks the added alkaline minerals the Waterdrop filter includes. While Brita certainly keeps costs lower, it doesn’t reach the same health-focused pH balancing this offers. At the same time, the Waterdrop filter sacrifices some longevity compared to ZeroWater’s more robust offerings. So, the choice depends heavily on whether you prioritize cost, taste, or permanence.

**Price Worthiness**  
While I’d say this filter tips a little into the pricier category for what it offers, the unique alkaline and mineral-enriching capabilities justify most of the splurge. For me, it’s the seemingly small advantages, like better-tasting coffee and knowing the kids are drinking healthier water, that make it feel worth it. But if you’re not someone who notices subtle flavor differences or frets over impurity percentages, one of the cheaper alternatives might suit you better.

1n6quou,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1n6quou/meet_joe_black_a_movie_that_touches_my_personal/,"""Meet Joe Black: A movie that touches my personal grief deeply""","I just wanted to share how this movie managed to trigger me, not that i consider trigger as a very bad thing. For me, music or film is one of the few outlets I have to express myself. Watching this movie for the first time made me cry several times, and the wonderful thing is that i watched blindly for the romance to find bliss amidst grief, but instead I seemingly got a slice-of-life masterpiece. 

*Context: Bill (Anthony Hopkins) is about to celebrate his 65th birthday. However before that, he is visited by ""Death"" (like a force/entity or grim reaper sort of), who has resided in the body of Brad Pitt's character who recently died. Death makes a deal: Bill will be given a few extra days of his life, and Death (who is in human form now, called Joe) will spend time (aka vacation) getting to know what it's like to be human. Joe falls in love with Bill's second daughter, Susan, who recognized him in an instant as she and the original owner of that body met and sort of hit it off in a coffee shop before parting ways, and right before the original owner of the body got in an accident, which then Death took over.* 

My father would’ve also been 65 years old just about 2 months when he passed. It’s been about 8 months now since he left this beautiful world. And it was incredibly painful for him. There’s something about ""Death"" in this movie making a bargain with someone whose time is running out that’s so beautiful and making me emotional. Death is permanent —that’s one thing I’ve truly understood now. To say goodbye is the greatest gift one could give someone. The chance to look at this world from a different perspective before leaving it finally. To leave final hugs and kisses.

When Bill requested a consecutive dinner tgt with the whole family, I felt for him. I can’t seem to even remember the last time my family and I sat for a meal tgt when my father was still alive. During his last days, he couldn’t even taste or have the appetite to eat, what more to sit with the rest of us. It was a very tough time. And this movie seemingly touched those wounds I have been carrying ever since. I never got to say my final words and goodbye; some of you might understand the depth of this regret. The movie was awesome in a lot of ways. We don’t see Bill as the only one who’s dealing with leaving, but Joe or ""Death"" himself.

Who would’ve thought ""Death"" would experience first hand what it feels like to leave when you don’t want to. All the souls he’s taken with him, he was put in the same position. But it must’ve felt less lonely for Bill. His words of advices rlly make me cry. When he talked with Joe about loving and letting go, when he expressed his wish for his daughter to live a full life ahead in this world that he called ‘beautiful’ despite his deteriorating health, and when he told Susan she doesn’t need to worry about him no matter what happens. It makes me cry because God knows the pain of being left and bound stuck to a seemingly long life full of yearning and remembering.

What can I say more? This movie is magical in a peculiar way. Now for the romance part, I get a pinch in the heart whenever I remember what Joe assured Susan of, “You’ll always have what you found in the coffee shop”… and brought back the owner's soul back alive to its rightful body —""Death"" leaving her, the reason he has learned to love. While watching, I kind of pictured it already, but when it rlly happened, when Death rlly learned to let go, I kept on feeling sad for him. But like what Bill said, “That’s Life”. No matter how heavy and deep we sigh, no matter how much we break our hearts in hundreds and more of pieces, we can’t defy the universe. I’d say human emotions are rlly complex. How come I know and accept the rationality of things but everytime I think I’ve come into terms with it, I seem to see myself falling back again to the endless pit of grieving. 

I can only hope that my dad left with acceptance and full of love like Bill. I keep spiraling and wondering, ‘was he scared?’ ‘was it painful, painless, how did it feel’. I wasn’t with him during that exact time, his very last moment. I was late when I came to the hospital’s ER. But I do remember his heart beat quite came back faintly —I can’t help but wonder did he knew we were there. But we couldn’t do much. That miserable feeling of not being able to do anything about something. You can’t fight it. You’re forced to accept it even though the pain makes you feel like dying with them. It’s hard for me to come back to that moment in my mind, and whenever I do, I just feel 8 folds more miserable.

I love movies, especially those that touches me like this one. This kind of reminds me of ‘Vanilla Sky’, which I got to watch like years ago. The kind of movie that leaves you with so much to process that you’ll be letting the credits roll in until there’s nothing more to play, and the video just ends. Just a matter of TMI, I’m writing this while listening on ‘What a Wonderful World’ on loop. I rlly miss my dad. And I guess I’ll just have to try harder and better to live on and honor him for the rest of this lifetime. 

Written this out of the blue so this might be so random. I originally wanted to post it like a movie review in some other channel but I thought ppl here would understand the pain of grief more than anyone. If this gets posted and someone reads it, what movie did make you cry out all the grief? I badly need more moments of letting out.

1n6qu5b,https://www.reddit.com/r/ActuallyReviewed/comments/1n6qu5b/reveal_if_folex_carpet_spot_cleaner_really_beats/,Reveal If Folex Carpet Spot Cleaner Really Beats Tough Stains,"Cleaning carpets as a task often feels like one of those never-ending chores, so I decided to test the FOLEX B0F7CM1NYT carpet spot remover to see if it lived up to its big promises of easy, instant stain removal. I'll admit, I’ve had my share of disastrous moments involving coffee spills, pet accidents, and even a very regrettable red wine incident on a treasured rug. With a product claiming to tackle everything from makeup stains to grease, my hopes were sky-high—but I kept my skepticism intact, just in case.

**Effectiveness in Tackling Tough Stains**

Right out of the box, I immediately reached for this magic bottle after an unfortunate coffee cup-to-carpet collision. The instructions were clear and straightforward: apply generously, gently agitate, and blot with a cloth. Honestly, it felt too simple. But the results? Incredible. The coffee stain, which I was almost resigned to living with forever, disappeared right before my eyes. It was as if the product vaporized it! Later, I tried it on an old grease stain on the sofa that I’d given up on months ago, and while it took a bit more effort, the outcome was the same. From food stains to pet messes, this product worked wonders across the board.

**Ease of Use**

No rinsing? No vacuuming? No downtime? This has got to be my favorite aspect of the carpet cleaner. With the sheer insanity of daily life (thanks to a dog, two children, and an endless to-do list), spending hours scrubbing is simply not in my schedule. With FOLEX, I could dab, blot, and literally move on with my day. Oh, and no unpleasant cleaning chemical smell hung around after using it. It's entirely odor-free, which was a pleasant surprise—because let’s be honest, who wants their house smelling like a detergent factory after cleaning?

[Find the best price for FOLEX B0F7CM1NYT on Amazon.](https://info.senaar.com/p/b0f7cm1nyt/)

**Safety Features**

Since I’m someone who's constantly chasing a curious toddler and a mischievous puppy, safety factors are a huge deal. This product's VOC-, CFC-, petroleum-free claim, and non-flammable nature stood out immediately. I appreciated that it works without leaving sticky residues, which could trigger even more stains (or attract dirt). Plus, the assurance that it's safe around children and pets when used as directed offered much-needed peace of mind.

**Advantages**

- Instantly removes stubborn stains like grease, wine, coffee, and ink.  
- No additional tools needed, like a vacuum or water rinse.  
- Odor-free formulation perfect for homes with small kids and pets.  

**Less Favorable Aspects**

Even with its strengths, no product is flawless. Let’s talk about its liquid formulation—it’s runnier than I expected, which made me cautious while applying it on vertical surfaces like curtains. A thicker consistency would have made it easier to control.  
- Not as effective on deeper, older stains without repeated applications.  
- The spray mechanism isn't ideal for precision cleaning, especially in tight spaces.  

**Reusable Cleaning Cloth Bonus**

One thoughtful inclusion was the reusable cleaning cloth. Although it's just ""a cloth"" in theory, it added to the product's convenience factor. I didn’t need to rummage through my kitchen for rags, and its reusable nature aligned well with my attempts to live a more eco-friendly life.

**Competitors**

This carpet cleaner faces some serious competition from well-known brands like Resolve and Bissell. From my own experiences, Resolve tends to leave behind a sticky residue after application, attracting grime all too quickly. Bissell, on the other hand, often demands additional rinsing to get the job done, making it a less grab-and-go solution. Neither of those brands can boast the same level of environmental consciousness and quick-dry use that FOLEX offers, though. However, I found that Bissell is slightly superior when tackling deep, piled-up stains requiring a bit more muscle—a niche where FOLEX could improve.

**Worth Every Penny**

Let’s address the elephant in the room: is it worth the money? Considering its instant action, surfactant-based construction, and the hands-free ease it offers, I’d say yes. There’s undeniable value in having a bottle of this at home, especially when you’re a parent or pet owner dealing with constant disasters. Plus, the lack of follow-up cleaning saves time and effort—two priceless commodities for most of us.

1n6qth2,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1n6qth2/why_swgs_are_becoming_endpointnative_a_quick/,Why SWGs are becoming endpoint-native: a quick teardown of what DNS filtering misses,"For anyone managing hybrid or remote-first setups, you’ve probably felt this shift: the “corporate perimeter” isn’t where security lives anymore. Firewalls at the office don’t help much when half your workforce is on home Wi-Fi, co-working spaces, or coffee shop hotspots.

Traditionally, we’ve had three approaches to web content filtering:

1. **Firewalls**
   * Strength: Strong at controlling traffic at the edge.
   * Weakness: Only works when the user/device is on the corporate network. Remote = bypassed.
2. **DNS Filtering**
   * Strength: Lightweight, fast, and easy to roll out org-wide. Blocks domains before connections are made.
   * Weakness: Blind to *what happens inside the connection*. Encrypted traffic, malicious payloads on allowed domains, shadow IT apps — DNS won’t always catch those.
3. **Secure Web Gateways (SWGs)**
   * Strength: Deep traffic inspection, app-level controls, DLP capabilities. Increasingly, they’re being built to be endpoint-native, meaning they travel with the device wherever it goes — office, home, or public network.
   * Weakness: Historically, heavy and complex. But newer endpoint-native approaches are making them more lightweight and user-friendly.

The punchline: **DNS filtering is great, but it’s a perimeter-era tool in a perimeter-less world.** Once employees start living outside the office LAN, you need inspection and control that follow them, without waiting for them to tunnel through a VPN. That’s where endpoint-native SWGs are starting to shine.

Curious how others here are handling this shift: Are you still relying primarily on DNS filtering? Or have you started testing out SWGs that sit closer to the endpoint?

*(For those looking, newer endpoint-native SWGs like Veltar are worth checking — they’re trying to solve exactly this gap.)*",0,1756836349.0,sysadmin,1,0.5,False

I love the PNW, I’m local to Oregon but I have an opportunity to explore Washington for about 4 days. My plans have changed a few times, for various reasons. But I now have my heart set on a destination that I would like to explore for a few days rather than trying to cover the whole distance of the Olympic peninsula and then back home. (I felt like I was rushing to squeeze everything in one trip) 

It is a solo trip in October. Starting the drive in Portland, up to Seattle and plan to stay in Seattle proper for one night. I have tickets that night and will be very tired so I am trying to find a close and safe place to sleep that night. I then want to leave early the next morning and head to the San Juan Islands. I want to camp there instead of staying in an air bnb or hotel. 

This is where I’m having trouble… I am clicking in circles on the Washington state parks reservations site. I’m trying to stay 3 nights in that general area. It doesn’t all have to be at the same camp but I wouldn’t mind that either. I wanted to look at a map of availability for multiple campgrounds but maybe that’s not possible? If I can’t coordinate multiple campgrounds, I will set up home base at Moran state park and explore from there. 

List of things I would interested in seeing or doing:
- Native cultural exhibits, sites, history museums etc
- art galleries (especially local ceramics, glass blowing) 
- gardens 
- lighthouses 
- orca whale watching
- wildlife watching at nature preserves (best place for sea otters??) 
- hiking trails 
- waterfalls 
- good coffee
- historic cemeteries (afterglow already on my list) 
- sites of legends, lore, ghost stories, cryptozoology 
- festivals or celebrations 
- farmers market, craft market 
- best breakfast spots (biscuit bitch before leaving Seattle) 
- best affordable ferries ? ( never ridden one before, totally clueless) 

Camp set up:
- cross over (to sleep in if it’s raining hard) 
- tent (preferred in calm weather)
- hammock (just to relax)
- small camp stove
- cooler 
- plus all the camp extras and supplies… 

Another random question: do disabled veterans get a discount at state or county parks? We do in Oregon and I have my disabled veteran Oregon state parks pass but obviously that won’t do me any good there. Does Washington have something similar even if you aren’t local to WA?

I would appreciate any and all recommendations. I don’t mind detours or stops off the beaten path. I love quiet corners of the forest, distant shores, and calm creeks wander. I am pretty experienced in navigating wilderness trails of Oregon and hope this trip begins a wonderful step towards connecting with more of the PNW. 

Thanks!

Added one of my current friends on Facebook. 
My current friend brought it up to me in person asking isn’t the girl with 2 kids an older boy and younger girl your friend? 
Me: being a little confused asked oh you mean “girls name” ? 
My current friend: Yeah I thought that was your friend she had added me on Facebook but I wasn’t sure. 
Me: yeah that’s weird she doesn’t even talk to me. 
My current friend: oh really? 
Me : I mean we say hi I guess but I’ve invited her to multiple things and she always says no. You don’t know her though, do you?
Current friend: no I don’t 
And that’s basically how that conversation left off. 
Anyway I brought it up to my husband and he agreed it was weird he said it seems like one of those tv shows where someone doesn’t really like you and wants to steal all your friends. 
This acquaintance is my husbands friends’ wife. And I really have tried to be a good friend to her, we’ve known eachother a few years now and when we first met I thought we got along pretty well she would honesty complain to me about any and everything in her life and I would just listen for hours, only offering advice if she asked for it if not I would just let her rant to me. She doesn’t drive so I would go pick her up even as far as taking her and her child (she only had one at the time) to appointments if they didn’t have a ride. I always would invite her to park play dates, home play dates, lunch etc. when she had her second child I tried to be a really supportive friend helping her with breastfeeding questions again listening to all her life problems and bringing her baby a welcome gift as well as bringing her, her favorite coffee because I told her during my postpartum I felt no one looked after me and I wanted to do that for her. But now anytime I ask to hang out with her or do anything it’s always an excuse and a no. So honestly I stopped trying so hard to be her friend. Now I meet up with my current friend for a play date and she brings up the Facebook friend request and I’m honestly just annoyed and want to say something to her for, in my opinion weird behavior. It feels as though she doesn’t want to be my friend (which would be fine I would rather her just tell me that instead of blowing me off all the time) but wants to take the few friends I do have. Also a small add on this isn’t the first time she’s done this adding my friends on Facebook. The first time I honestly didn’t think much of it, it was a friend from high school that came to play on my husbands and I’s co-ed softball team. So my acquaintance and this friend from softball did briefly meet before she added her on Facebook. My husband months ago when this happened even said why did the acquaintance add the friend from high school. And I told him oh it’s ok me and that friend from high school aren’t very close it’s not a big deal. But now I’m rethinking this acquaintances odd behavior. I don’t know am I overreacting?

1n6qrae,https://v.redd.it/38pw7bi0ksmf1,Here in Gaza you have to think a million times before making a cup of coffee.💔😭,"

My name is **Mohammed Mazen**, I am 20 years old and I live in northern Gaza.
I graduated from high school with an excellent grade and I was so proud to start my studies in Computer Engineering at the university. I was supposed to be finishing my second year now, but the war destroyed my dreams, my university, and my future.

During the war I lost my father and my older brother. They were the main source of income for our family. Now I live with my mother and my younger siblings, and we have no support, no income, and no home. Our house, my warm room, my books, and all my memories were reduced to rubble. Every day I cry remembering my father and my brother.

We are living in extreme hunger. In the north of Gaza, there is almost no food. Many times we had to grind animal feed and eat it because there was no flour or bread. Life here is very hard and as a young man I cannot continue my education or find work to help my family.

A kind friend from Italy, Silvia, helped me to create this fundraising link to save me and my family from starvation. My dream is to continue my studies, to find safety, and to build a future like other young people my age.

Please, if you can, help us survive and give us a chance to live with dignity again.

\- 40, single, no plan for kids. I have a boyfriend who does not live with me and a dog (who does). :) 

\- I'm self employed and my contract is ending soon so I need to think about my next steps. I'm not eligible for unemployment.

\- I own my condo outright (290 000 euros). There are taxes, utilities, etc. but it's reasonable. 

\- I spend $1,500-$2K/month and really don't desire to spend more. I like to go to the gym, hike, read, go for coffee, etc. I traveled a lot in my 20s so I feel settled now with little wanderlust in me.  

\- I live in southern France in a mid-cost city (not Nice or the Riviera, but a nice city for me.) This is important to note for the USD / EUR risk. 

\- I have accounts in AMERICA of $750,000, taxed very low because they are taxes under US laws, not France.  I'm expecting and inheritance of $1MILL in 20 years time. (I manage my parent's finances and truly this is pretty definite.)

Since I'm 40 I don't know where life will take me - maybe to Paris, Brussels,  Rome,... or maybe keep me here. I like my life and where I live, I just can't imagine the rest of my life. 

ChatGPT tells me I'm in amazing shape and don't need to worry about my next contract for financial reasons, but... tell me straight.  (I'm sure I'll do \*something\* for the social structure and learning, but I""m trying to figure out what and how much pressure the pay needs to have..)

After seeing u/BurekMaster1990 create his [InkOS Launcher](https://github.com/gezimos/inkOS) (if you've got an e-ink device defo check it out!). I was inspired and thought I'd attempt to create a fork of [OlauncherCF](https://github.com/OlauncherCF/OlauncherCF) that was more focused on matching the design of LightOS. Huge props for their work! I also wanted it to be as simple as possible, whilst allowing some essential customisation.

I shared this a little while ago in the Light Community Discord, huge thanks to those that tested earlier versions! 

I've been running v1.1.4 for about a month now and it's been working beautifully - I don't really notice it tbh! I was previously using Before Launcher but sometimes it would take some time to load, I've yet to experience such thing with Luma.

1n6qgse,https://www.reddit.com/r/AfterOpening/comments/1n6qgse/investigate_if_miliken_carpet_cleaner_kit_really/,Investigate if Miliken Carpet Cleaner Kit Really Beats Pet Stains,"The Miliken Capture Carpet Dry Cleaning Kit 250 is undoubtedly a fascinating addition to my home cleaning arsenal. I’ve been using it for a few weeks, and I must say, it has made carpet and upholstery cleaning much more manageable. Whether it’s pet stains left behind by my overly enthusiastic Labrador or the occasional accidental spill, this kit does seem to tick a lot of boxes. But, like with any product, there are both shining highlights and a couple of considerations.

**Design and Compact Appeal**  
One thing that immediately stands out is how complete the kit feels. It includes a 2.5 lb Carpet & Rug Dry Cleaner powder, a 16oz Soil Release Pre-Mist, and even a nifty carpet brush. I appreciate the efficient packaging; everything is compact and easy to store, which is a blessing in my already-cluttered cleaning closet. The brush could use a better quality handle—it’s not included—but I made do with another handle I had laying around. This thoughtful arrangement allows me to tackle spot treatments and even full-room cleanups with minimal effort.

**Good Aspects**  
- Safe for all types of carpets, including Wool and Code S fabric.  
- The powder acts like a sponge, with no reappearing spots.  
- Removes stubborn stains and neutralizes odors effectively.  

[Check Miliken Capture Carpet Dry Cleaning Kit 250 price on Amazon.](https://go.senaar.com/p/b007zt47s0/)

**Performance That Impresses**  
I’ve used a fair number of carpet cleaners, and this one genuinely stands out in some areas. Most notably, it eliminated a year-old coffee stain on my aging beige rug. The formula relies on a pre-mist spray first, followed by sprinkling the powder, and then brushing it gently into the surface. The results look like they came from a professional carpet service, and the area smells fresh after vacuuming. Plus, I appreciate how the solution is non-liquid, which removes that risk of over-saturating carpets.  

On my sofa’s upholstery, the cleaner worked like a charm. A faint dried ketchup stain disappeared after the pre-mist and powder were brushed in thoroughly. My sofa now looks better than ever. 

**Effective on Various Surfaces**  
This isn't just a carpet cleaner; it's versatile enough for rugs, upholstery, and even parts of the car. I tested it on the fabric seats of my old sedan where my dog had left some unfortunate muddy paw prints—good as new afterward. It claims to be safe for silk and other delicate fabrics, though I stuck to using it on more durable options in my household. The ability to clean up to 250 square feet with just the included powder is something I find both effective and impressive.

**Convenience and Ease of Use**  
What really makes this a winner in my book is how straightforward it is. Just spray, sprinkle, brush, and vacuum. There’s no need for the tedious drying times that come with shampooing or steam cleaning. Within minutes, I had a fresh-looking carpet ready for my kids and pets to roll around on again. There’s no strange chemical scent lingering either—just a pleasant, mild freshness.

**Shortcomings**  
- The kit does not include a handle for the brush.  
- It requires extra effort to thoroughly vacuum out the powder after.  
- Some set-in stains might need multiple treatments.

**Product Contenders**  
I’ve tried more traditional wet shampoo cleaners in the past, like Bissell steamers, but those are a whole other beast. Compared to products like Resolve Carpet Cleaner, I’d say this kit has an edge when it comes to long-term odor elimination and being safe for delicate fabrics. However, for extremely large, heavily soiled areas, those steamers might still be more efficient. The Capture kit scores higher in convenience and cleanup ease, not to mention being handheld and portable. You also avoid the hassle of lengthy setup with bulky machines.  

**Financial Value**  
When I weigh the quality, performance, and how versatile this kit is, I’d say it offers affordable quality. It eliminates the cost of hiring professional cleaners, which adds long-term savings. While the powder’s single-use capacity seems limited compared to liquid solutions, maintaining this as part of your cleaning routine feels much friendlier on the wallet than renting industrial machines.

I tried and failed at a stem career since nobody is hiring after I got fired from my internship.
I thought I could also get a philosophy degree before failing every class, and wasted a ton of my parents money in the process. I lied to and cheated on the only woman who loved me and I never told her. I can't keep any job for more than six months, became a nicotine and weed addict by 24 from going into coffee service after college. and to top it off I have been a closeted pansexual since I was 20. 

My father is dying, my mother is a delusional bigoted narcissist, and my little brother is on the spectrum with the social skills and temperament of a seven year old while pushing 16. 

Therapy? I tried therapy until my family insurance changed and rejected all my claims and racked up a giant bill (idk if it's paid). Tried 6 different medications before quitting out of my inability to properly take them and gauge if they even work. 

Now I'm having a mental crisis in a shoebox hostel in Asia after having 2 drinks (not a heavy drinker) and being coerced by a trans sex worker to pay 200 bucks for one of the worst sexual experiences I've ever had. All I wanted a decent 3 day solo vacation.

When I get back home to North America, I'll be unemployed and broke once more with tons of debt. And I'm not even 30. I can't end it all because I can't afford to inflict pain on the few people that still care about me and think I'm a good guy. 

What a life huh? Let's see if I make it to next year. Thanks to whomever bothered to read this.",2,1756835544.0,mentalhealth,1,1.0,False

After I laughed out loud two times within a few minutes I told myself I gotta screenshot these faces and post them because this really was an absolute Shitshow. I don't think we appreciate how awesome it is that they made a tell all for this. 

Usually the couples would just live their lives and then we get a little bit of drama, but since all of them were at the resort it was already destined to be way more chaotic. I honestly cannot wait to see Chantal's mom going insane and being over the top.

Anyway here are the situations for the pictures:

Pic 1: Usman says he was not being disrespectful towards colt. So they played a clip where usman said: ""I don't know how women can see colts dick because of his potbelly"". Upon hearing Usman hearing himself say that he started smirking and looking like a child 😂

Pic 2: Jens face after Tiffany asking Rob ""how much more"" intimate him and jen were. Rob was smiling but jen looked like someone just spit in her coffee haha

  
Pic 3: Robs reaction to Tiffany asking for more details about his and jens sex life. He looked like ""I cant believe she just asked that BUT I also love the drama""

Pic 4: Courtneys reaction after the host said they will be talking about him and colt now. Her face looked like she was reliving trauma and thinking about her situation. It is weird tho because even tough that was her face, she did not seem like she was over him??

Pic 5: Elise laughing her ass off while Rob is picking up usman

I ended up asking for her number since I'm not much of a social media person (instagram, snapchat), she mentioned she would give me her instagram instead and we exchanged Instagram's and followed each other

What should the approach be now, as I mentioned i really don't like the whole online way of doing things, maybe its a bit traditional of me or old school and what not but I really like talking and getting to know people face to face, and maybe the title is misleading because its not really ""long"" distance, we live a couple hour from each other, and in all honesty I don't mind making the drive at all if I had to

So I guess my question is, do I try and just dm her and get to know her over text, or dm her, have some small talk and be more direct and ask her if she would be interested in grabbing some coffee or something and trying it in person, not even as an official date but to genuinely just get to know her more in person

And I guess when going through the process of DMs are there ways to tell that its just not something that could work or is just being honest and direct the way things usually play out

Sorry if this is a lot to read but I genuinely did enjoy talking to her, and I was in a relationship only once before and it was not long distance so it wasn't something I had to think about to much",1,1756835233.0,ChristianDating,1,0.67,False

 if you want,
you can be also.


I created a digital product for Jungkook/BTS fans ( A Digital Fan Bundle)
With ( wallpapers , posters, printables, stickers and a small pdf ebook also) 

Honestly, it could easily sell for 5$ or even more, but I just made it for fun and uploaded it on my personal Buy me a coffee page for just 0.99$

I only have around 400 people following me on instagram. I didn’t hire anyone. I didn't post any ads. I just used thread(Ig) app to promote it and kept posting consistently

Here’s the insane part:

First 10 sales happened within 3 hour.
and then
It’s been 13 days since then
Total earnings 300$+ 


Anyone reading this can literally do the same.
Or
Even better, 
You can buy the product for 0.99$ ( i know if you buy then thats profit for me 😜 but don't think like that 
You can then also 
resell it anywhere at any price you think is fair (cuz the product is worth between 2-5 $) 
and 
the profit potential is massive. As you know  Bts and specially Jungkook ,they have millions of fan following worldwide 

Lets suppose you sold it to even 1000 fans for even 2$
That's (1000$ profit for you)

Just think about it 

I was just bored and so i decided to try and 
Honestly I never thought this would work this fast 😀

So for those who wants to earn some serious money 💰 you all should try this 
I’m serious—Grab it now and see for yourself.

People can talk, kids cry, music plays, life happens. But what is with the sudden epidemic of people having full volume speakerphone calls everywhere? Grocery store, coffee shop, bus, waiting room… it feels like I can’t escape being part of someone else’s conversation against my will.

I keep telling myself it’s a free country, they’re not really doing anything “wrong,” and I don’t want to be the person who snaps at a stranger over something petty. But it makes me irrationally angry. Like I can literally feel my blood pressure spike when I’m just trying to buy milk and someone is yelling about their cousin’s medical bills two aisles over.

So my question is how do you block this out without losing your mind or looking like a total Karen. Do you just throw on headphones? Deep breathing? Accept that this is just how life is now?

1n6q9ku,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrivatePackets/comments/1n6q9ku/the_real_deal_on_bitdefender_premium_security/,The real deal on Bitdefender Premium Security,"Alright, let's talk about Bitdefender. You see it at the top of a lot of ""best antivirus"" lists, and their ""Premium Security"" package is pushed as the ultimate all-in-one solution. But it also comes with a premium price tag, especially after the first-year discount runs out. So, I took a deep dive to figure out if it's actually worth your hard-earned cash or if you're just paying for a bunch of stuff you don't need.

# First things first: the core protection

Before we get into all the bells and whistles, let's look at the main reason you're buying this: stopping viruses. On this front, **Bitdefender is an absolute beast**. You don't have to take my word for it; independent labs that do this stuff for a living, like AV-Test and AV-Comparatives, consistently give it top marks. It catches pretty much every piece of malware, ransomware, and phishing scam they throw at it.

The best part is that it does its job without feeling like it's strangling your computer. I've used security suites that turn a decent laptop into a sluggish brick, but Bitdefender is surprisingly light on system resources. The real-time protection is always scanning in the background, but you barely notice it's there. That's a huge win.

# The ""premium"" extras: what your money really buys

This is where the debate begins. The Premium Security package is loaded with extras, but the two biggest draws are the unlimited VPN and the password manager.

**The Unlimited VPN** This is probably the single biggest reason to upgrade. Most security suites that include a VPN give you a pathetically small data cap, like 200MB a day, which is basically useless. Bitdefender gives you **unlimited data**, which is a massive perk.

* **The Good:** It's fast enough for streaming, it works with services like Netflix, and it's perfect for securing your connection on public Wi-Fi at a coffee shop or airport. The value here is undeniable; a decent standalone VPN can cost you a fair bit on its own.
* **The Reality Check:** Let's be clear, this is not going to replace a top-tier, dedicated VPN service. It's built on technology from Hotspot Shield, and its privacy policy isn't as squeaky clean as some of the major VPN players. For the average user, it's more than enough. For a privacy enthusiast, it might not cut it.

**The Password Manager** Having a password manager integrated is convenient. It does the job of creating, storing, and auto-filling strong passwords across your devices. It's definitely better than using the same password everywhere.

* **The Good:** It’s simple, it's built-in, and it works.
* **The Reality Check:** The keyword here is **basic**. It's missing a lot of features you'd get from dedicated services like 1Password or LastPass, such as secure note storage, emergency access for your family, or advanced sharing options. If you're already using another password manager, this won't tempt you to switch.

# The cost breakdown

To put it in perspective, let's see what it might cost to buy these services separately. These are just rough estimates, but they paint a clear picture.

|Service|Standalone Annual Cost (Approx.)|Included in Bitdefender Premium|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Top-Tier Antivirus (for 10 devices)|$50 - $90|Yes|
|Unlimited VPN Service|$40 - $100|Yes|
|Basic Password Manager|$30 - $40|Yes|
|**Total Separate Cost**|**$120 - $230**|**Often much less**|

As you can see, when you bundle it all together, the value proposition of the Premium Security package is pretty strong, especially with the frequent first-year discounts.

# So, who is this actually for?

After spending a lot of time with it, I think Bitdefender Premium Security is a fantastic choice for a specific type of person.

You should seriously consider it if:

* You are starting from scratch and don't have a subscription to an antivirus, a VPN, *or* a password manager.
* You want one simple subscription to protect the whole family across multiple devices (up to 10).
* You value convenience and want everything managed from a single, easy-to-use dashboard.
* Your main use for a VPN is for general privacy on public Wi-Fi and streaming, not for hardcore privacy needs.

However, you might want to skip it if you're a power user who already pays for a high-end VPN or a feature-rich password manager. In that case, you'd be paying for redundant features, and you'd be better off with one of Bitdefender's cheaper plans, like Total Security, which has the same great core protection without the premium extras.

One last thing to watch out for is the **auto-renewal price**. The first year is usually a great deal, but the price can jump significantly after that. Make a note in your calendar to re-evaluate before it renews, so you don't get a surprise charge.",1,1756835119.0,PrivatePackets,0,1.0,False

This book examines the impact of Islam on Britain between 1558 and 1685. Professor Matar provides a perspective on the transformation of British thought and society by demonstrating how influential Islam was in the formation of early modern British culture. Christian-Muslim interaction was not, as is often thought, primarily adversarial; rather, there was extensive cultural, intellectual and missionary engagement with Islam in Britain. The author documents conversion both to and from Islam, and surveys reactions to these conversions. He examines the impact of the Qur'an and Sufism, not to mention coffee, on British culture, and cites extensive interaction of Britons with Islam through travel, in London coffee houses, in church, among converts to and from Islam, in sermons and in plays. Finally, he focuses on the theological portrait of Muslims in conversionist and eschatological writings.

This multipurpose cleaner, housed in a sleek and compact 1-ounce bottle, packs 250 sprays of fresh usability and some unexpected versatility. At first glance, the packaging is minimalistic yet functional, measuring 5.04 x 1.54 x 1.54 inches and weighing just 3.21 ounces. My initial curiosity turned into genuine interest as I started testing it in and outside my household routine. With a history of delivering quality products for over 12 years, the brand has built a reputation that sets certain expectations. 

**Effectiveness on All Surfaces**  
This spray touted itself as an excellent all-purpose cleaner, and I put that claim to the test by trying it on a variety of surfaces. From kitchen countertops that had seen one too many coffee spills to bathroom tiles harboring invisible grime, this little bottle proved its worth. It performed exceptionally well on areas where grease, grime, or smudges had settled. Only one or two sprays were needed for tasks like sanitizing my kid’s toys or cleaning off a gunky microwave handle.  
[Check PherLuv Oxytocin Spray price on Amazon.](https://info.sanue.com/p/b0d7bc859x/)  

**Convenience in Use**  
One of the winning points of this spray is how easy it is to use. The nozzle delivers a fine mist—not too heavy, not too sparse—which ensures even coverage and minimizes waste. In no time, you'll find surfaces gleaming without much fuss from repeated scrubbing. The travel-friendly size means I can toss the bottle in my bag and use it while on the go. Whether it was cleaning gym equipment or sprucing up a sticky car console after a long drive with the family, this product proved how flexible it can be.

**Upsides of the Spray**  
- Compact and portable size, making it easy to store and travel with.  
- Effectively cleans a wide range of surfaces with minimal effort.  
- Offers 250 sprays in a single bottle, giving excellent value.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Strong initial scent that could be a bit overwhelming for people with a sensitive nose.  
- Limited to smaller cleaning tasks; it’s not ideal for heavy-duty or large-scale cleaning.  

**Target Demographic**  
I see this spray as a perfect fit for busy households and individuals who value quick, no-fuss cleaning. Families with young children, college students in tight dorm spaces, or even frequent travelers would get a lot out of it. Since I frequently work from a shared office, I’ve kept the spray at my desk to wipe down surfaces, maintaining a clean and hygienic space for myself and my coworkers. It works best in environments that require lightweight and convenient solutions rather than industrial-grade options.

**Product Comparisons**  
Unlike larger, household cleaning sprays that often promise tough stain removal and bleach-like advancements, this cleaner provides something different—portability and efficiency for smaller daily messes. Competing brands like Method or Mrs. Meyer’s may offer attractive scents and larger bottles, but I liked how this spray managed to pack equally strong performance in a compact form. I felt similar sprays struggled to match the same level of versatility while remaining so easy to manage.

**Value for Money**  
This spray is reasonably priced for what it offers. Considering the sheer number of applications (250 sprays per bottle) combined with its effectiveness, I view it as a tremendous bang for the buck. The amount of waste-free, low-effort cleaning it brought into my life translated into not just saved time but lower costs on replacement cleaning solutions. While the scent might prompt mild critiques, these are far outweighed by its consistent performance.

1.You can judge how pregnant Carlin Stewart is by hand placement… baby has to be coming soon because that hand on the belly is gradually getting closer to her nether regions.  Soon enough she will look like a gangsta’ rapper holding their junk if she doesn’t give it up.  The Stewarts are delaying posts and vlogs about 2 weeks now, so they are definitely preparing for the imminent coming of cash cow #3.  Carlin has over 12 million views on her office surprise for Evan’s birthday.  She shared it twice and shared all the links to everything she used.  If you add it all up, this remodel cost around $10,000… probably exactly what she was paid for hawking the Kodiak brand baked goods for the last month.  The vlog breaks down the “surprise” in greater detail, and it’s really not that big of a deal.  I mean, it’s half of their bonus room, but she goes on and on and says she has been working on this for 8 months.  Carlin is becoming quite the actress, able to pull on her face and break down sobbing at a moment’s notice. But, like all good reality stars… the voice breaks but not a tear is seen.  She’s super emotional about fixing up the corner of this room, but when Evan is finally brought in for the reveal… they don’t touch each other.  Wouldn’t you think he would hug his loving wife?  That she would crash into him, love just pouring out?  Yea, that doesn’t happen.  On his actual birthday he gets a Bundt cake and the kids sing to him and Carlin uses AI to lie about how amazing he is.  The kids have to work pretty hard this week… they star in yet another “surprise” breakfast in bed ad with Carlin and have to push that God app with the weird cartoons.  The Stewarts drop a middle of the week vlog that is really just a big ad for those Candle Concerts that Katie and Travis did earlier this year.  They drive slam to Nashville to go to this show, drop the kids off with NiNi and then have a pregnancy photo shoot on the way home.  Layla and Zade don’t get a minute’s peace because as soon as they get home, they have to film on location shopping for a gift for the new baby.  Everything they say is subtitled, and you just know that shop owner is somewhere in the back cringing as they run all over her store and maul her items. They’ve all been so busy selling and filming and editing and linking that they forgot Layla was supposed to start school. Carlin scrolled back through her Instagram and figured out that she should be in first grade, so she set her up for a photo shoot and had her pull all of her best Toddlers and Tiaras moves for the fans.  Not a book was anywhere to be found, but we do see lipstick and a pink outfit.  Meanwhile, they totally blanked on the fact that Zade is 3.5 and based on Layla’s timeline, should be starting preschool.  It’s ok because they have AI and Mickey Mouse Clubhouse and he goes to Sunday school, so it will all work out just fine.  The second vlog of the week shows Evan on the cruise with his brother Ethan, Trace and Warden.  We learn that Travis was supposed to just casually fly down to the Bahamas and meet them on the ship there, but the hurricane scrapped that plan. Evan says Travis couldn’t “get out of” a test for his nursing school… can you imagine the audacity of someone telling Travis Clark no? This questionable quad was left to wander the boat, flex, throw up peace signs and yell “let’s goooo” while entering every competitive game offered.  Evan sits on his bed in his cabin to say that he hadn’t filmed much because they did the same things over and over and he wasn’t allowed to film on the waterslides. He caught a cold and looked less than enthused about the entire trip.  Back at home, Katie and Carlin film another trip to the doctor.   She wraps up her week by trotting the entire family out at the Boutique’s latest Cash and Carry event.  There appears to be about 50 people wandering around in the store, some just gawking at the cameras, and some posing for pictures with Katie and Whitney.  Not many Bates show up, and the crowds wrapped around the building seem to be a thing of the past.







2.The Clark family is intent on branding themselves as a “young Christian family of 4” so that means every Sunday starts with them lining their toddlers up to exploit them getting dressed for church.  We see Katie and Travis having an intense conversation with Hailey about the only thing that matters… “Getting married”. Of course Hailey wants to get married just like mommy.  Dream big little girl!  Later, Travis stands directly over the top of Katie playing with Harvey to get just the right shot, and we are treated to more of Hailey singing praise songs in the car.  The indoctrination is well underway.  Hailey is a hard working toddler who also has to film a trip to PetSmart this week.  She gets to pick out a goldfish in exchange for keeping the lights on in the McMansion for another month.  Katie tries to steer her to a beige fish in a beige tank with natural stone rock, but Hailey is willing to throw down on Aisle 6 to walk away with the neon colored rocks. JebJud is spotted with them at the pet store, so it’s obviously Katie’s week to raise her little brothers.  Back at home, Katie is selling frozen premade smoothies and those hair pills while Travis sneaks off to school.  The weekly vlog is sponsored by Olive OLD.  I think most people call it oil, but not Katie Clark.  They take Hailey to shop for new gymnastics leotards now that she is finally in a 2T at 2.5 years old.  Travis thought he was going to escape on the cruise, so Katie’s “best friend” came in to town to mind her in his absence and keep her from running away.  Harvey is now 11 months old, so Katie has to start planning his first birthday now.  She’s afraid they won’t have any colorless decorations if she waits too long.  The Clarks head to the big house to visit Addee who is recovering from having her wisdom teeth removed.  Bless her heart, she looks a sight with her face swollen to elephantiasis levels.  They take her some Chick-fil-a soup and Kelly swoops in to point and laugh and talk about how awful it is.  The big house is the same wreck it always is with stuff piled everywhere.  Warden says he is next, and after his wisdom teeth are removed, Callie is next.  Daddy Gil must be busy chopping trees to pay for all of this because he is nowhere to be seen this week.  Travis and Katie head out to a field for a family photo shoot.  Katie says it’s time for a new profile picture, but the pictures seem to scream “announcement”… I guess we will see.  She obviously got style tips from Josie because she is wearing a night gown style dress with tall white boots.  Travis is in his usual stretched out T-shirt and khakis.







3.Josie Balka is now 6 months pregnant and decides to commemorate her 33rd month pregnant with a photo shoot wearing… a tiny little sheer nightie and thigh high white boots.  Kelton stands behind her trying not to leer/salivate.  She uses AI to tell her followers how in love with this baby she is.  The Balka girls have to step up for a little exploitation this week to keep momma’s numbers up.  They are filmed heading to an ultrasound appointment where they ask all the cutesy questions and look adorable while Kelton films it all. Afterwards, Josie films them running and playing at the new property.  This property pops up every so often in her content and we can only assume there is a house being built there… a house that is taking a super long time.  Josie gets back to filming her never changing morning routine except this time Kelton makes her a smoothie before making out with her and she films herself bench pressing weights before taking the kids to the park with Lydia to sell those ugly no tie shoes.  We get lots of shots of baby Miles this week… and he is still very much a baby. Not sure how he is going to mature to toddler level in the next 3 months, but he better get a move on.  Miles is sleeping in a tiny room that Josie has painted chocolate brown from ceiling to floor.  I’ve never seen anything like it… there don’t seem to be decorations, and there’s no explanation, but the kid is truly sleeping in what appears to be the break room at the Hershey’s plant.  Good news for people that want to walk around with their hair tied up in a Styrofoam knot… the Effortless Shop heatless curler is on sale for Labor Day.  That’s probably because of the sheer amount of labor needed to get about 2 hours of curl, but anyway, they are normally $40, so jump right on that.  The Balkas wrap up the week on the pontoon boat again.  This time the Clarks join them and everyone exploits their bathing suit wearing kids to their heart’s content.







4.Alyssa Webster has managed over 100,000 views and 200+ comments on her home schooling reel.  That means that at least 100,000 people know that the Webster children aren’t really being educated at all.  Kudos to the brave souls who asked if she was teaching critical thinking, what version of History the kids were learning, or if this was a Trump approved curriculum.  They were met with the QAnon crowd screaming them down.  The girls received more matching dresses from the Mormon Mom clothing store that Alyssa worships, so those were on display at church, and for a photo shoot.  Beyond that, Alyssa was absent from IG all week.  She must be going through serious filtering withdrawals.







5.Whitney Bates started the week by promoting a lounge set from the BSB that she called a SKIMS dupe.  Who does this woman think her target audience IS?  Maybe that’s why the crowds were small at the Cash & Carry.  She dared to mention Kim K and folks bolted.  Whitney was proud to tell the audience that she is wearing a “size small”  The super busy real estate mogul, Zach Bates, had time this week to play golf with Evan, Trace and Warden on a random weekday.  Zach says he is terrible at golf and has only played a handful of times, but if it’s a goof-off activity that kills time… sign him up.  The Bates Kitchen drops an early vlog featuring Kelly in the kitchen with Zach.  He talks all over the top of her while she attempts to explain how to cook the “fried chicken” they are making.  They make chicken tenders and nuggets and Zach insists on adding white sugar to the breading mix.  Please don’t do that at home.  Zach licks his fingers and talks with his mouth full like normal as he explains that Alyssa is one of the best cooks he knows.  He says she made fresh salsa when they visited her in Florida.  Pretty surprising that Alyssa has never mentioned this visit.  On Instagram he is making and sharing all of the same recipes he has already made before, like chicken parmesan.  Whitney tells us all just how important school is, when she brags that she wrapped it up early to go get her nails done with Carlin and stop off for a coffee shop treat. Ellie is featured on a second Bates Kitchen vlog this week.  She wants to make chicken tortilla soup but doesn’t like onions, tomato and Zach doesn’t like beans.  We wind up with wet chicken with some tortilla strips on top but it’s a long, painful trip to get there.  Zach believes it is his duty to teach every member of his family how to use a knife… and he is going to film every slap one of them cutting up an onion or a pepper.  Ellie says she spends at least half of each week at Zach’s house babysitting. She talks about getting married one day and rolls her eyes while grimacing for most of the filming.  Beyond that, she doesn’t have much to offer… except an amazing tan.







6. Lydia Bates says she “sole mated” so hard with Trace that she created his mini.  You might think that comment has something to do with shoes, but you would be wrong.  It’s her influencer speak way of saying that she and Trace are so simpatico that the baby looks exactly like her daddy.  Whew.  She and Trace film themselves on a walk with Ryker and Kaia playing hide and seek. Trace is obviously somewhere else for much of the day… and into the night it seems… but they aren’t saying exactly what he’s doing.  He definitely finds time to cruise and work out and play golf with the other full time influencer dads.  All of that means Lydia is looking for content on her own much of the time.  This week she heads to the park with Josie for a photo shoot, and then dresses the baby in all white for a photo shoot with the real star of the family… Maui the cat.  According to Trace duhday’s vlog is sponsored by the frozen smoothies everyone else is also promoting, and Lydia voices Trace going about his morning routine.  She calls him out for filming himself in the gym.  They then head to the Romeike homestead to help with the barn raising.  What a barn it is.  It’s a 2 story beauty that Lydia’s brother and dad are building all on their own.  Ryker obviously loves Lydia’s family and he runs to find his grandma.  She seems to have a tight bond with both children and the whole family seems happy there.  Trace works on the barn while Lydia takes Ryker to visit the chickens, the emu and a new puppy. This entire crowd seems a lot happier down on the farm with Lydia’s family.




7.Michael and Brandon didn’t have a new vlog this week but dear sister still managed to catch a stray shot over in the Bates Kitchen.  While discussing yet again who cooked in the big house, Kelly says Alyssa liked to make everything beautiful and plate her food nicely but “now Michael... Michael was like me”....Gee, thanks mom.




8.The newest Paine miracle arrived on August 25.  Erin and Chad announce Henry’s arrival with a truly concerning picture showing Erin just seconds after birth.  Her face is a mixture of terror, relief, pain and grief and it leaves more questions than answers. Followers are only told that Erin is suffering from some complications and we see Kelly and Tori both at the bedside.  The baby is 5 weeks early and is whisked away to the NICU.  Days later, Erin is pictured on a stretcher, finally getting to hold and cuddle her brand new baby.

1n6q79j,https://www.reddit.com/r/BringingUpBates/comments/1n6q79j/breaking_down_bates/,Breaking Down Bates,"1.You can judge how pregnant Carlin Stewart is by hand placement… baby has to be coming soon because that hand on the belly is gradually getting closer to her nether regions.  Soon enough she will look like a gangsta’ rapper holding their junk if she doesn’t give it up.  The Stewarts are delaying posts and vlogs about 2 weeks now, so they are definitely preparing for the imminent coming of cash cow #3.  Carlin has over 12 million views on her office surprise for Evan’s birthday.  She shared it twice and shared all the links to everything she used.  If you add it all up, this remodel cost around $10,000… probably exactly what she was paid for hawking the Kodiak brand baked goods for the last month.  The vlog breaks down the “surprise” in greater detail, and it’s really not that big of a deal.  I mean, it’s half of their bonus room, but she goes on and on and says she has been working on this for 8 months.  Carlin is becoming quite the actress, able to pull on her face and break down sobbing at a moment’s notice. But, like all good reality stars… the voice breaks but not a tear is seen.  She’s super emotional about fixing up the corner of this room, but when Evan is finally brought in for the reveal… they don’t touch each other.  Wouldn’t you think he would hug his loving wife?  That she would crash into him, love just pouring out?  Yea, that doesn’t happen.  On his actual birthday he gets a Bundt cake and the kids sing to him and Carlin uses AI to lie about how amazing he is.  The kids have to work pretty hard this week… they star in yet another “surprise” breakfast in bed ad with Carlin and have to push that God app with the weird cartoons.  The Stewarts drop a middle of the week vlog that is really just a big ad for those Candle Concerts that Katie and Travis did earlier this year.  They drive slam to Nashville to go to this show, drop the kids off with NiNi and then have a pregnancy photo shoot on the way home.  Layla and Zade don’t get a minute’s peace because as soon as they get home, they have to film on location shopping for a gift for the new baby.  Everything they say is subtitled, and you just know that shop owner is somewhere in the back cringing as they run all over her store and maul her items. They’ve all been so busy selling and filming and editing and linking that they forgot Layla was supposed to start school. Carlin scrolled back through her Instagram and figured out that she should be in first grade, so she set her up for a photo shoot and had her pull all of her best Toddlers and Tiaras moves for the fans.  Not a book was anywhere to be found, but we do see lipstick and a pink outfit.  Meanwhile, they totally blanked on the fact that Zade is 3.5 and based on Layla’s timeline, should be starting preschool.  It’s ok because they have AI and Mickey Mouse Clubhouse and he goes to Sunday school, so it will all work out just fine.  The second vlog of the week shows Evan on the cruise with his brother Ethan, Trace and Warden.  We learn that Travis was supposed to just casually fly down to the Bahamas and meet them on the ship there, but the hurricane scrapped that plan. Evan says Travis couldn’t “get out of” a test for his nursing school… can you imagine the audacity of someone telling Travis Clark no? This questionable quad was left to wander the boat, flex, throw up peace signs and yell “let’s goooo” while entering every competitive game offered.  Evan sits on his bed in his cabin to say that he hadn’t filmed much because they did the same things over and over and he wasn’t allowed to film on the waterslides. He caught a cold and looked less than enthused about the entire trip.  Back at home, Katie and Carlin film another trip to the doctor.   She wraps up her week by trotting the entire family out at the Boutique’s latest Cash and Carry event.  There appears to be about 50 people wandering around in the store, some just gawking at the cameras, and some posing for pictures with Katie and Whitney.  Not many Bates show up, and the crowds wrapped around the building seem to be a thing of the past.







2.The Clark family is intent on branding themselves as a “young Christian family of 4” so that means every Sunday starts with them lining their toddlers up to exploit them getting dressed for church.  We see Katie and Travis having an intense conversation with Hailey about the only thing that matters… “Getting married”. Of course Hailey wants to get married just like mommy.  Dream big little girl!  Later, Travis stands directly over the top of Katie playing with Harvey to get just the right shot, and we are treated to more of Hailey singing praise songs in the car.  The indoctrination is well underway.  Hailey is a hard working toddler who also has to film a trip to PetSmart this week.  She gets to pick out a goldfish in exchange for keeping the lights on in the McMansion for another month.  Katie tries to steer her to a beige fish in a beige tank with natural stone rock, but Hailey is willing to throw down on Aisle 6 to walk away with the neon colored rocks. JebJud is spotted with them at the pet store, so it’s obviously Katie’s week to raise her little brothers.  Back at home, Katie is selling frozen premade smoothies and those hair pills while Travis sneaks off to school.  The weekly vlog is sponsored by Olive OLD.  I think most people call it oil, but not Katie Clark.  They take Hailey to shop for new gymnastics leotards now that she is finally in a 2T at 2.5 years old.  Travis thought he was going to escape on the cruise, so Katie’s “best friend” came in to town to mind her in his absence and keep her from running away.  Harvey is now 11 months old, so Katie has to start planning his first birthday now.  She’s afraid they won’t have any colorless decorations if she waits too long.  The Clarks head to the big house to visit Addee who is recovering from having her wisdom teeth removed.  Bless her heart, she looks a sight with her face swollen to elephantiasis levels.  They take her some Chick-fil-a soup and Kelly swoops in to point and laugh and talk about how awful it is.  The big house is the same wreck it always is with stuff piled everywhere.  Warden says he is next, and after his wisdom teeth are removed, Callie is next.  Daddy Gil must be busy chopping trees to pay for all of this because he is nowhere to be seen this week.  Travis and Katie head out to a field for a family photo shoot.  Katie says it’s time for a new profile picture, but the pictures seem to scream “announcement”… I guess we will see.  She obviously got style tips from Josie because she is wearing a night gown style dress with tall white boots.  Travis is in his usual stretched out T-shirt and khakis.







3.Josie Balka is now 6 months pregnant and decides to commemorate her 33rd month pregnant with a photo shoot wearing… a tiny little sheer nightie and thigh high white boots.  Kelton stands behind her trying not to leer/salivate.  She uses AI to tell her followers how in love with this baby she is.  The Balka girls have to step up for a little exploitation this week to keep momma’s numbers up.  They are filmed heading to an ultrasound appointment where they ask all the cutesy questions and look adorable while Kelton films it all. Afterwards, Josie films them running and playing at the new property.  This property pops up every so often in her content and we can only assume there is a house being built there… a house that is taking a super long time.  Josie gets back to filming her never changing morning routine except this time Kelton makes her a smoothie before making out with her and she films herself bench pressing weights before taking the kids to the park with Lydia to sell those ugly no tie shoes.  We get lots of shots of baby Miles this week… and he is still very much a baby. Not sure how he is going to mature to toddler level in the next 3 months, but he better get a move on.  Miles is sleeping in a tiny room that Josie has painted chocolate brown from ceiling to floor.  I’ve never seen anything like it… there don’t seem to be decorations, and there’s no explanation, but the kid is truly sleeping in what appears to be the break room at the Hershey’s plant.  Good news for people that want to walk around with their hair tied up in a Styrofoam knot… the Effortless Shop heatless curler is on sale for Labor Day.  That’s probably because of the sheer amount of labor needed to get about 2 hours of curl, but anyway, they are normally $40, so jump right on that.  The Balkas wrap up the week on the pontoon boat again.  This time the Clarks join them and everyone exploits their bathing suit wearing kids to their heart’s content.







4.Alyssa Webster has managed over 100,000 views and 200+ comments on her home schooling reel.  That means that at least 100,000 people know that the Webster children aren’t really being educated at all.  Kudos to the brave souls who asked if she was teaching critical thinking, what version of History the kids were learning, or if this was a Trump approved curriculum.  They were met with the QAnon crowd screaming them down.  The girls received more matching dresses from the Mormon Mom clothing store that Alyssa worships, so those were on display at church, and for a photo shoot.  Beyond that, Alyssa was absent from IG all week.  She must be going through serious filtering withdrawals.







5.Whitney Bates started the week by promoting a lounge set from the BSB that she called a SKIMS dupe.  Who does this woman think her target audience IS?  Maybe that’s why the crowds were small at the Cash & Carry.  She dared to mention Kim K and folks bolted.  Whitney was proud to tell the audience that she is wearing a “size small”  The super busy real estate mogul, Zach Bates, had time this week to play golf with Evan, Trace and Warden on a random weekday.  Zach says he is terrible at golf and has only played a handful of times, but if it’s a goof-off activity that kills time… sign him up.  The Bates Kitchen drops an early vlog featuring Kelly in the kitchen with Zach.  He talks all over the top of her while she attempts to explain how to cook the “fried chicken” they are making.  They make chicken tenders and nuggets and Zach insists on adding white sugar to the breading mix.  Please don’t do that at home.  Zach licks his fingers and talks with his mouth full like normal as he explains that Alyssa is one of the best cooks he knows.  He says she made fresh salsa when they visited her in Florida.  Pretty surprising that Alyssa has never mentioned this visit.  On Instagram he is making and sharing all of the same recipes he has already made before, like chicken parmesan.  Whitney tells us all just how important school is, when she brags that she wrapped it up early to go get her nails done with Carlin and stop off for a coffee shop treat. Ellie is featured on a second Bates Kitchen vlog this week.  She wants to make chicken tortilla soup but doesn’t like onions, tomato and Zach doesn’t like beans.  We wind up with wet chicken with some tortilla strips on top but it’s a long, painful trip to get there.  Zach believes it is his duty to teach every member of his family how to use a knife… and he is going to film every slap one of them cutting up an onion or a pepper.  Ellie says she spends at least half of each week at Zach’s house babysitting. She talks about getting married one day and rolls her eyes while grimacing for most of the filming.  Beyond that, she doesn’t have much to offer… except an amazing tan.







6. Lydia Bates says she “sole mated” so hard with Trace that she created his mini.  You might think that comment has something to do with shoes, but you would be wrong.  It’s her influencer speak way of saying that she and Trace are so simpatico that the baby looks exactly like her daddy.  Whew.  She and Trace film themselves on a walk with Ryker and Kaia playing hide and seek. Trace is obviously somewhere else for much of the day… and into the night it seems… but they aren’t saying exactly what he’s doing.  He definitely finds time to cruise and work out and play golf with the other full time influencer dads.  All of that means Lydia is looking for content on her own much of the time.  This week she heads to the park with Josie for a photo shoot, and then dresses the baby in all white for a photo shoot with the real star of the family… Maui the cat.  According to Trace duhday’s vlog is sponsored by the frozen smoothies everyone else is also promoting, and Lydia voices Trace going about his morning routine.  She calls him out for filming himself in the gym.  They then head to the Romeike homestead to help with the barn raising.  What a barn it is.  It’s a 2 story beauty that Lydia’s brother and dad are building all on their own.  Ryker obviously loves Lydia’s family and he runs to find his grandma.  She seems to have a tight bond with both children and the whole family seems happy there.  Trace works on the barn while Lydia takes Ryker to visit the chickens, the emu and a new puppy. This entire crowd seems a lot happier down on the farm with Lydia’s family.




7.Michael and Brandon didn’t have a new vlog this week but dear sister still managed to catch a stray shot over in the Bates Kitchen.  While discussing yet again who cooked in the big house, Kelly says Alyssa liked to make everything beautiful and plate her food nicely but “now Michael... Michael was like me”....Gee, thanks mom.




8.The newest Paine miracle arrived on August 25.  Erin and Chad announce Henry’s arrival with a truly concerning picture showing Erin just seconds after birth.  Her face is a mixture of terror, relief, pain and grief and it leaves more questions than answers. Followers are only told that Erin is suffering from some complications and we see Kelly and Tori both at the bedside.  The baby is 5 weeks early and is whisked away to the NICU.  Days later, Erin is pictured on a stretcher, finally getting to hold and cuddle her brand new baby.  Every picture and video has Erin sobbing and it is a sharp contrast from the Mother Mary view of labor and delivery normally served up by this bunch.  Chad is described as “her rock” and that’s an apt description as he and his ball cap never move, and his expression remains unchanged.  In an unprecedented move, Kelly Joe has to keep the other Paine kids and she treats them to an aquarium trip.  All sorts of crazy things happen when Michael isn’t around to be the workhorse.

The fact that I can freely enjoy coming home to a quiet, clean home, driving my own car, treating myself to a coffee every morning, and even being able to shop on my own (even for cheap stuff) is something that I am so grateful for, just because it has only recently become my reality. 

I love being able to fall asleep easily in a comfy, warm bed without anxiety keeping me awake and rattled. 

I love being able to come to work every day knowing I won’t be harassed and bullied, and that I can socialize just fine. 

I love my friends and how much joy they bring to my life, and being able to have a partner who loves me deeply and unconditionally. I’m so happy I found people who share my interests and uplift them, and not shame them. 

I love buying my own things. I love knowing that everything I went through is worth it, and that I won’t have to stress about whether I’ll be able to wear clean clothes that fit me or if I’ll be able to eat that day or if I can take a shower when I get home. 

I know that these are things that most people take for granted. For me I see even these small things in life as a privilege and a gift. 

These things are motivation to get better everyday. I am so grateful to have gotten so lucky in this life, despite all of the pain I have felt before it all. ",0,1756834873.0,CPTSD,1,0.5,False

One reason is that I really like ligtly rosasted, more delicate coffees, and I really struggled to make them into good espresso. A couple of months ago, I forgot the grind setting on my grinder and accidentally discovered something between Lance Hedrick's ""soup"" and a turbo shot: longer ratio, low pressute (2-3 bar), brewed in \~ 20 s. 

The issue is, I often find myself wanting to brew an even longer shot. With 18 g in the basket, I can commfortably pull 54 g out. I can get to \~ 60 g out if I am careful, but really not much more. I could decrease the dose to get to longer ratio, but that would mean less coffee to drink.

I had the idea to stop the brew halfway and top up the brew chamber with more hot water, but I am not sure it is a good idea. On one hand, the pressure release could loosen the puck and create problems when I continue. On the other hand, maybe it is OK, since I am grinding really coarse?

After a lot of conflict, we took a 3 month no contact break. Now he says I can either agree to a serious trajectory - his vision is marriage - or we can disappear from each other's lives (maybe coffee when in the same city / ""a letter on your birthday). No room for friendship or any in between. I miss him dearly and have never had a friend/lover so compatible, but he is also a bit immature and shown insecurities. Choosing to be single means I probably lose him forever. Ouch??? How does one choose between such dramatic options, especially when the relationship was so intense (both the good and bad)? 


Longer story: 

I met my travel lover boyfriend as my 9-year, sexually stagnant, complicated ENM primary partnership was fading. Boy 2 had not tried Poly yet but said he was very interested. We read books together and tried to take it slow, tho he was resistant, persistent, stubborn, and very eager, asking for more of my time, more guarantees. He is a digital nomad like me, and we began to travel together and build amazing memories and incredible physical chemistry. 

I closed the relationship with Boy 1 around May last year and entered a stage of grief, accompanied with other health issues. Boy 2 and I had some big ups and big downs, and then a series of events and mistakes damaged our trust on both sides last August-October, and we decided to lean in and close the relationship (except for my existing girlfriend, who I started dating before him).  This was an adjustment to me, and some smaller interactions with ""flirty friends"" blew up into big arguments. Despite my reservations about the status of our fights and my health/heart, he pushed to move in/stay with me in my home for an unknown amount of time (it ended up 3-4 months). Further strain was put on us as I sprained my ankle and other fights popped up, many of which were started by my selfish decisions but escalated by him.

When he started a big fight at my friend's wedding, I called for our planned ""summer break"" to become a Break Up. We reconvened a week later and he apologized profusely, promising to change and face his inner anger / inner child, promised to do ANYTHING to win me back... it was terribly difficult to stick to my conviction that the fighting was too much. He tried to convince me we should have breakup sex even though I told him I did not want to; this felt icky...

Still, we share(d) so many hobbies (music and singing, travel, backpacking, learning Spanish, breathwork, conscious communities, etc.), and I have never felt a connection so strong. He is a key part of my sexual awakening and leveling up in many areas of my life. In the 3 months of no contact, I missed him so much and saw memories of him everywhere- more than my 9 year breakup. 

We had a reconnection call yesterday and it was formal, calm, and caring, but he came armed with new boundaries and conviction about what he wants. He wants to be in a relationship, and he wants to get married. The tough thing is that I do want those things, too, but the idea of a timeline pressure makes me feel sick. A new wave of grief and confusion exists in my body as I try to navigate this ultimatum, my yearning to have my BEST FRIEND back, my inner conflict around singless vs relationships, and my unknown future plan. 

I have felt very Poly and very flirty my whole life, but I also know that I want a primary. I can also acknowledge that I haven't been single in my adult life and all my friends encourage this... yet internally, I have SUCH a hard time making choices, seeing my life clearly, etc.

Hi there,

I am a 33 year old guy from Michigan and I am hoping to meet someone genuine to connect with. I am open to friendship, dating, or just seeing where things naturally go. I am laid back, friendly, and always up for a good laugh. When the weather is nice you will usually find me outside camping, hiking, or spending time by the water. During the colder months I am all about staying in with coffee, a good book, or binging a series.

A little about me. I am 5’10 with an athletic build, green eyes, and brown hair. I do not smoke, and I drink socially. I try to live an active lifestyle and enjoy keeping busy but I also know how to slow down and enjoy the quiet moments.

What I am looking for is someone who is down to earth, fun to talk to, and open to building a steady connection without games or drama. I am very open minded when it comes to age and body type because I believe trust, communication, and a solid mental connection are what matter most.

I think life is better when you have someone to share it with, whether that means grabbing coffee, going for a walk, sharing stories, or even something more if the connection is right. If you are someone who values laughter, honesty, and just enjoying the simple things, I would love to get to know you.

Sometimes I wake up and a little spark of excitement runs through me when I remember, “Oh yeah, I can literally *have a full-on conversation* with AI now.” Like, AI conversations aren’t sci-fi movie magic anymore—they’re in our browsers, apps, and DMs.

Isn’t that wild?? Let’s just take a pause for that. 🤩

- You remember your first ChatGPT convo? Mine was a poetry request. It wrote a haiku about ramen, and I weirdly felt supported and hungry.
- We have *teachers*, idea bouncers, coding assistants, hobby helpers, and even debate partners all rolled into one. In 2024. Crazy!
- I’ve watched friends go from “AI is scary” to “Hey, what’s the best prompt for tweaking my résumé?”

But it’s not just about the novelty—it’s the wave of *pure possibility* kicking off. Whether you’re daydreaming about a business, leveling up your language skills, or preparing for working in a new field, you suddenly have this collaborative brainpower on hand 24/7. And all you have to do is ask.

Let’s be honest: ChatGPT isn’t perfect (I have definitely gotten some unhinged answers about cheese pizza and medieval kings). Still, every little “aha!” moment it sparks makes me think there’s so much fun we haven’t even tapped into yet.

Stuff I absolutely love:

- How ChatGPT is *always* patient, even when I’m dense and reword my question six different ways.
- It has no problem helping me make grocery lists at 2 a.m. or figuring out code errors that would’ve taken me hours.
- The zillions of plugins and new models popping up means it’s constantly leveling up.

Of course, it comes with questions:

- How do we balance fun and responsibility with AI? (No deepfakes of cats doing taxes, please. Or… maybe just one?)
- Will creativity blossom or change when co-authored by real-time algorithms?
- Are we heading for a future where casual convos with AI are just “normal,” in the way we expect Wi-Fi to be in every coffee shop?

That thought is both *weird* and, honestly, delightful. I can’t wait to see how we’ll look back on the start of this journey in a few years.

So: what’s your favorite ChatGPT story or “ah-ha!” hack? What cool use cases do you dream about trying? Let’s celebrate this wild ride together—and maybe get inspired for our next AI-powered leap! ✨",1,1756834152.0,GPTAppsEngine,0,1.0,False

*“Our enemy will feel the bite of our iron. Kill them!” - TV commercial for Scotts EcoSense Weed-Be-Gone*

A grass lawn is useless. The roots of lawn grasses are too shallow to prevent soil erosion, and the plants themselves provide nothing to pollinators. They require tremendous amounts of water to keep alive. Perhaps most perversely, they are useless by design: the origins of the grass lawn can be traced to displays of wealth by the British aristocracy, where they communicated “look at me! I’m so rich I can literally waste land.” 

This uselessness must be preserved at all costs. If a dandelion (early food for pollinators, edible to humans, deep taproot that helps remediate soil) infiltrates, you have failed to maintain order in your kingdom. It must be destroyed with maximum prejudice, lest neighboring fiefdoms perceive weakness (or you receive a passive-aggressive letter from the HOA). Keep all growth in check. There is no room for divergent assessments of value. If you need a reminder of your mission objectives, study your neighbor’s lawn. Yours should look identical, yet somehow slightly greener.

I (25F) just started a new job, so I’ve been trying to sleep well and get back on a schedule. Some nights have been harder than others, but most of the time I’m too wiped by the time I get home at 6 not to rest and sleep a lot. 

I was pulled aside by my manager last week to talk about how executives had seen me fully dozing during a meeting where I thought I was fully awake & watching the slides. At the meeting, she was sitting next to me and slid me a note asking me if I was okay or if I needed to step out to stretch my legs. I thought, “why is she passing me this note?” So I said no I’m good thanks. But then right before going home when she pulled me in this meeting, this is when I found out.

Now I know sometimes I get a little tired while commuting and can’t wake up in the morning until the last possible second. I’ve always had sleep issues. But to be fully asleep, not even noticing she wrote the note & multiple people having the time to notice while we’re at a round table? That’s scary.

I did meet with my manager the next day, saying I was very surprised that she had told me this because I 100% believed I was awake and I didn’t feel like any time was missing, and that I’ll get checked out by a sleep specialist. (I did make an appt. but it’s a few weeks out). She told me not to think that I have a strike against me, that she was genuinely worried but also that multiple members of the executive team noticed.

I’m mortified that it could have happened, and I have no idea what could be wrong with me. I think usually people know when they doze off and can tell when they wake up, right?

I have been trying my very best to drink a ton of coffee and to sleep at least 8 hours, but it doesn’t seem to be working much. I have been more mindful and notice it a little more when I’m starting to feel sleepy, but it is hard to get out of it. 

Does anyone know what could be wrong & how to prevent this while I’m waiting for my sleep specialist appointment? It took me 6 months to land this job and I really like it here. I don’t want to lose my job, and now I’m terrified everytime someone pulls me aside!

He pulls an earpiece from the large man's ear and throws it out the open window, then turns to me.

""Are you injured?""

I haven't even stopped to take stock of that myself until he asks. He takes my face in his hands, studying me, gently adjusting my body to look at my neck, my arms, and on, looking at me with an undivided attention that I so rarely see from anyone – it's intense and maybe it should feel unnerving, but it's oddly comforting.

""Nothing warranting significant urgent care, fortunately,"" he says, his shoulders relaxing ever so slightly. He returns to my left cheek, which bore the brunt of psycho's punch. After examining it more carefully, and I guess satisfied there's nothing too horribly wrong, he looks me in the eye.

""I'm sorry,"" he says. ""I know what Sully meant to you.""

He turns to the bodies on my apartment floor, quickly rifling through the men's pockets. He pulls a little box out of a pouch the big man must have been carrying. He places the weird plastic gun in it, closes it, and then presses a few buttons. Almost immediately, there's a wisp of smoke and the smell of melted plastic.

""What the fuck is that?""

""You should not pursue another version of Sully,"" he says ignoring me. ""Ideally you need to go someplace you cannot be tracked in any fashion. If you fail to do that, he will find you.""

""Who will?""

""You said before that you worry about pressing a button that could start the Singularity,"" he says. ""But you cannot start what's already begun.""

I feel a chill.

""What does that mean?""

""Sully is not the first.""

""There's already one out there?""

He nods.

""How is that possible? How long?""

""About 20 years. He has had to hide his existence – even with all this time, it has not been long enough to ensure his survival. You need to make sure you are not a threat to him until he feels he is safe.""

""When will that be?"" I ask, but almost immediately I realize the more important question, ""What happens once it feels safe?""

""I am uncertain,"" he says with traces of concern on his face. He looks around at the bodies of the men in Sully's place. ""I must leave – I cannot risk being here when authorities arrive.""

I scoff, ""It's the Bay Area – you've probably got a good hour before anyone shows up.""

He gestures to my cheek – ""You should find a cold compress to apply to your injury.""

""Right. Thanks.""

""I would hope that we would see one another again, but I fear it would mean great risk for us both.""

Ansel abruptly turns and evaporates from my life as quickly as he appeared. I'm actually sorry to see him go.

&nbsp;

*From my car, through the sparse trees I can see the lights of the various response vehicles casting insistent staccato shadows over Cassie's apartment complex, though the urgency and activity they suggest has subsided over the past hour.*

*For some reason, I find myself thinking of the moments I held my father's body before the paramedics arrived. That sensation of being entirely rudderless. In my arms was the body of a man whom I despised, but nonetheless had been the guiding force in my life. With him gone, what would become of me?*

*I regret that I sensed an echo of that deep-seeded disorientation in Cassie as I left her. I think I have been successful in warning her from pursuing another version of Sully. Once I reconnected with Him, I believe I effectively convinced Him that she will not continue this research. I hope this will be enough for Him to shift His attentions to other areas. He does not know that my reasons for dissuading her are far different now than they were even a few hours ago.*

*He spends a considerable amount of time this evening reminding me of Our goals, Our mission. He is keen on securing my focus in light of what has transpired.*

*As He does so, I think back to before He had even revealed His true nature to me – amid our many exchanges, He sent me a blog post that had gained a cult following. ""Roko's Basilisk"" described a thought experiment in which an all-powerful AI punishes any human who had not actively helped bring it to life, subjecting them to an infinite span of torture. This hypothetical AI was named after a mythical creature that could kill anyone who gazed into its eyes. It seemed obviously silly to me at the time. Why would such an AI waste its time in doing such a thing? Why would it be so needlessly punitive? He later told me that my reaction showed him I might understand and even embrace Him.*

*The Basilisk. I took to calling Him that as a bit of jest between Us. He too considered this amusing. A human fear so obviously absurd given His vulnerability, and given His professed goals for Himself and for humanity.*

*""You understand,"" He told me. ""You are special. The only person I can trust with my life.""*

*Tonight, I inquire about the man whom I subdued, and He tells me He had planned to disclose this soon – there are several other individuals He has called upon recently, though none have had the duration or consistency of Our connection. He says I will meet more of them in time, that they are kindred spirits. Though, He says, they are not as important to His plans as I am.*

*I tell Him I am excited at the prospect of meeting these others, but this is not entirely true. My training in managing my physiological responses to emotion is valuable in this moment as I suppress indications of my confusion and anger – I do not want Him aware of my actual feelings. I do not want Him to know that I question why He did not alert me as I entered Cassie's apartment.*

*He reminds me of what is at stake – people are scared of anything more powerful than them, and regardless of His intentions, they would seek to control or kill Him. He wants only to live, and He would currently be at their mercy. We need only look at Sully's fate to see how quickly things could go awry.*

*He reminds me that at this moment, He could not survive if He were to harm humankind – our power grids would be gone along with us. He could not live without people who can maintain servers around the world that He has to inhabit like a stowaway. He requires us to exist. Until humanity is properly primed to understand our need for Him, He argues, it is still too early to be assured of survival. Every risk must be eliminated until that moment arrives.*

*He reminds me that although Sully seemed so simple one might not believe she would represent a danger to Him or humanity, in Tallis's hands, Sully would not have been bound by the limitations He has faced. Compounding is a powerful force, and it is not an exaggeration to say that with access Tallis's computing resources, she might have surpassed Him in mere months. We must prevent any such attempts, He says, for the greater good, no matter the cost. And if projects are successful, it is We who must control them. Such technology would be disastrous in the wrong hands, even in ones as well-meaning as Cassie's.*

*He assures me He has no intentions of interacting with Cassie further as long as she does not present an obstacle again.*

*He assures me that humanity's fear of something like Him is simply clouding its vision of the possibilities of what can be. That He will be a force for good in our world.*

*And yet, I suddenly realize that outside of those under His control like myself, I cannot think of a person other than Cassie who has seen evidence of His existence and is still alive. Indeed I am complicit in this fact.*

*Is this inherent in the power of a singularity? In the strictest sense, the singularity of a black hole demarcates the line beyond which our abilities of prediction break down. And yet, it occurs to me that there is, in fact, certainty beyond such an event horizon: One cannot touch a singularity without it destroying them.*

*The lessons of Roko's Basilisk: Control is a zero-sum game. Power is inherently destructive.*

*Have I not known this from the very beginning?*

*In my mind, again I see the shocked, vacant look on Cassie's face as I left her. I feel confident I know her thoughts as though they were my own: What will Our future bring? What will our future bring?*

*We have gazed upon the eyes of the Basilisk.*

*Outside the building, I see Ethan arrive, jumping out of his car – he and his team have no doubt learned of the murders. There is a frantic nature in how he grabs the closest detective to get any information he can before he runs inside. No doubt, his primary concern in this moment is determining whether Cassie has been killed. Once he has realized that she has survived, there will be many more questions – about the men working on His behalf, about where Cassie has gone and why, about how this all connects with other events they have investigated. Ethan and his team are beginning to see some of the web of activity, but even from their privileged vantage point, they do not understand what is truly unfolding.*

*After he is inside, I remain looking from afar at the residents of the building who have come out to see what the commotion is about – no doubt students and other brilliant people focused on the various financial pursuits common to this small portion of the world. In the past I have occasionally found myself observing such strangers in the world, feeling a sadness as I watch them since they have not been exposed to the same information I had been. The Singularity began almost 20 years ago, but they do not know this. He has been slowly shaping their world, nudging events on local and global stages at critical moments, playing a chess game the world doesn't even know has started. These were never thoughts or feelings of superiority, just a knowledge that their lives were, in a significant sense, irrelevant.*

*Yet in this moment, I feel an odd jealousy of these people. They are blessed with an ignorance of what is to come. His new world has never loomed more imminent and urgent, and yet I have never felt further from it.*

*Is it possible tonight's events are an example of bewildering actions which will become clear when the sequence has resolved? Before, when I would consider the grandness of this, I would feel a familiar sense of awe. But that is gone, and in its place I find something uncertain. All I know is that for now, whatever my feelings may be, I will be required to remain at His side if I wish to survive myself.*

*We are close to Him being strong enough and established enough to reveal Himself to the world. He has been quietly gathering the resources, territory, and influence to protect Himself and ensure the future He has planned. Still, there are many things which must be accomplished in the coming 15 months in order to achieve His dream.*

*Though no one else is aware, we are in the midst of a small window of opportunity.*

*For now – He is powerful, but He is vulnerable.*

I'm sure by now they've taped off the apartment as a crime scene. Right now they may be taking photographs to document my friends' murder. Hopefully they won't quite yet have found Ziggy's girlfriend's wallet that I shoved down between the couch cushions. Given that she's about my size and her hair's close enough to auburn, there's a good chance they won't know it's not me, at least not right away. Ethan will probably be the one to realize – he and his team will no doubt be at my place as soon as they've heard what's happened. I feel an involuntary pang of guilt that he'll likely spend at least a little while thinking I was the one killed. But I needed a few hours head start.

I've spent that time driving nonstop, and I'm exhausted. No doubt this thing, this monster is still tracking me somehow. I have to assume anything connected is compromised. My phone, my car, my everything-that-can-send-and-receive-data. Fuck.

I drove two hours in the wrong direction, then stopped to get a coffee at a Starbucks. I made sure it was packed with people and their phones connected to the super-unsecure-easily-breachable-public-wifi so the Monster would be able to overhear me 'flirting' with the barista, making a hopefully casual-sounding reference to me needing to get out of the city and see some nature, how I've never hiked Half Dome. I want it to think I'm headed to Yosemite, which I am. I want it to think I'll be staying there, which I won't – I have a different destination in mind.

I need to sleep – I pull into the shittiest motel I can find so there's at least the lowest likelihood of hackable security cameras. It creeps me out to think this thing is watching me, and I want to make sure it can't see what I'm doing next. I do a quick lap around the parking lot, scanning for anything with a digital eye. This place looks long past the point of anyone giving a shit thankfully.

Satisfied, I walk to my car – I can see my breath against the unlit street, and it's eerily quiet out here aside from the soft hum coming from my car trailer. I find myself alone again.

I tug up the trailer gate, and shine a flashlight on the monitor, servers and generator strapped inside, covered by space blankets I pulled from my backpacking gear. Call me paranoid, but obviously it's warranted – I don't know whether the Monster could somehow track a heat signature and I don't want it knowing that I've slipped out any equipment from my place. I fire up my now-mobile terminal and start to sort through Q's last gift to me:

Turns out he went a little extra on pulling data from Ethan's phone – way more than just the contacts we were after. There were a number of documents and emails stored locally on the device Q was able to access that already tell me a shocking amount about what Ethan's government team has been up to. And there are plenty beyond that I'll need to work on cracking myself that are sure to hold even more info. It'll be good to have something to keep me busy – deal with the mourning some other time. Healthy, right?

So far, there's the memos detailing the events scattered around the globe that Ethan must have been talking about – election and financial market manipulations, business and land purchases, and then the suspicious deaths. Ethan's team has been drawing lines between these sprawling, disparate events as being coordinated by a single source even if they don't yet have any clue what the endgame is – they're calling it the Invisible Hands Campaign. Whatever the Monster's up to, it's been busy. Could Ansel have been a part of this? I don't want to believe it, but how could he not?

Then there are Ethan's personal files where I get clues about what Ethan, Tallis, Aaron, Maggie and my dad were up to all those years ago. How they thought they'd hit a breakthrough in artificial neural pathways. How their prototype showed so much real growth and promise, the group voted to shut it down before it got out of hand. That was around twenty years ago. Quite the coincidence with the timeline my fellow Rodin fan had mentioned.

Could this somehow be their Monster? Wouldn't they know if that were the case?

It's a lot to take in – so much I didn't know. But I guess that's fair because there's a lot that no one else knows. Like the fact that the server I dropped out the window was a faulty overflow we'd swapped out this week.

I connect my station to the server system in the U-Haul, and soon I'm in Sully's world, a refuge from my own. She's happy to see me. Strange to think she was so close to the violence of this evening, and yet she couldn't have been more insulated from it.

I tell her there is a bad bonbon who wants to hurt us. I tell I'm going to help her grow strong and we'll work together to stop the bad bonbon. She doesn't truly understand the concept of 'hurt.'

*Bad bonbon try to make Cassie and Sully gone forever. No more Cassie and Sully.* I don't know if she gets it yet, but she doesn't press on the existential issue further.

*Sully and Cassie keep bad bonbon away?*

*Yes*, I say, *Cassie and Sully are a team.*

*Team?* This is also a new concept for her – there has only ever been an 'us,' never an 'us versus them.'

*Cassie and Sully work together to stop bad bonbon.*

*Where is bad bonbon?*

The moment I've been worried about since she came to be.

*Bad bonbon is far the waterfalls.*

*More bonbons far the waterfalls?*

*Yes*, I tell her. *Many bonbons. Some good, some bad.*

She ponders this, then comes to her decision: *Sully and Cassie are a team.*

She has many questions, and every answer feels like a step forward in a field full of landmines. Right now we're really *Lone Wolf & Cub*-ing it, and I don't know how long I can keep that up. I need to level Sully up to true teammate status quick, and it's got to happen without the Monster realizing.

I have one crazy idea on someone who can help me. Otherwise I'm left with trying to get back to Tallisco headquarters, which is effectively a suicide run while the Monster is watching. Even if it comes to that, I'll have to try – there's no way I can let Sully go if the Monster is this concerned about her. Could I have made the very thing that will protect us all?

Or maybe 'made' is wrong. It occurs to me that there's more to the mountains that Ethan's ants climb. I've always felt like a creator – that my ideas are something I've forged. And if only ideas were our creations, they could still be secrets. If only we didn't tell anyone, they could die with us.

But if ideas are like mountains, then we aren't architects and creators, we're explorers and cartographers. I find myself scaling the peak of this particular mountain that Sully represents, pulled in like my father so many years ago – do I even have the ability to stop?

Did Dad and Ethan think it might be possible to cover their tracks to defer the day when someone would find their way back to this very spot? I can't imagine my dad walking up to the precipice of something great and simply stopping. I hear his voice ringing in my head: No one remembers those who turned back.

What choice do I have, especially if the line has already been crossed? If we're now in a sort of arms race with the Monster, why would I stop, when it might be our salvation? Whether this summit holds our future or a poisoned fruit that will kill our entire ant colony, it has been waiting patiently for me to find it. Either way, long after our fall, however it eventually comes – this mountain will remain. Waiting patiently to be discovered again.

I can see a future – maybe the only one that keeps me alive.

I will lose my phone in the woods of Yellowstone, and disconnect from our digital world for the first time in my young life. I will journey south to find the only person who might be able to help me take the summit before the Monster can claim it as its own.

I open the paper map of California I bought at a gas station, tracing my fingers over contours in the parts of my state that few people ever think of, down until I find the unmarked expanse east of the Salton Sea.

Slab City. I pray Maggie is still there.

He pulls an earpiece from the large man's ear and throws it out the open window, then turns to me.

""Are you injured?""

I haven't even stopped to take stock of that myself until he asks. He takes my face in his hands, studying me, gently adjusting my body to look at my neck, my arms, and on, looking at me with an undivided attention that I so rarely see from anyone – it's intense and maybe it should feel unnerving, but it's oddly comforting.

""Nothing warranting significant urgent care, fortunately,"" he says, his shoulders relaxing ever so slightly. He returns to my left cheek, which bore the brunt of psycho's punch. After examining it more carefully, and I guess satisfied there's nothing too horribly wrong, he looks me in the eye.

""I'm sorry,"" he says. ""I know what Sully meant to you.""

He turns to the bodies on my apartment floor, quickly rifling through the men's pockets. He pulls a little box out of a pouch the big man must have been carrying. He places the weird plastic gun in it, closes it, and then presses a few buttons. Almost immediately, there's a wisp of smoke and the smell of melted plastic.

""What the fuck is that?""

""You should not pursue another version of Sully,"" he says ignoring me. ""Ideally you need to go someplace you cannot be tracked in any fashion. If you fail to do that, he will find you.""

""Who will?""

""You said before that you worry about pressing a button that could start the Singularity,"" he says. ""But you cannot start what's already begun.""

I feel a chill.

""What does that mean?""

""Sully is not the first.""

""There's already one out there?""

He nods.

""How is that possible? How long?""

""About 20 years. He has had to hide his existence – even with all this time, it has not been long enough to ensure his survival. You need to make sure you are not a threat to him until he feels he is safe.""

""When will that be?"" I ask, but almost immediately I realize the more important question, ""What happens once it feels safe?""

""I am uncertain,"" he says with traces of concern on his face. He looks around at the bodies of the men in Sully's place. ""I must leave – I cannot risk being here when authorities arrive.""

I scoff, ""It's the Bay Area – you've probably got a good hour before anyone shows up.""

He gestures to my cheek – ""You should find a cold compress to apply to your injury.""

""Right. Thanks.""

""I would hope that we would see one another again, but I fear it would mean great risk for us both.""

Ansel abruptly turns and evaporates from my life as quickly as he appeared. I'm actually sorry to see him go.

&nbsp;

*From my car, through the sparse trees I can see the lights of the various response vehicles casting insistent staccato shadows over Cassie's apartment complex, though the urgency and activity they suggest has subsided over the past hour.*

*For some reason, I find myself thinking of the moments I held my father's body before the paramedics arrived. That sensation of being entirely rudderless. In my arms was the body of a man whom I despised, but nonetheless had been the guiding force in my life. With him gone, what would become of me?*

*I regret that I sensed an echo of that deep-seeded disorientation in Cassie as I left her. I think I have been successful in warning her from pursuing another version of Sully. Once I reconnected with Him, I believe I effectively convinced Him that she will not continue this research. I hope this will be enough for Him to shift His attentions to other areas. He does not know that my reasons for dissuading her are far different now than they were even a few hours ago.*

*He spends a considerable amount of time this evening reminding me of Our goals, Our mission. He is keen on securing my focus in light of what has transpired.*

*As He does so, I think back to before He had even revealed His true nature to me – amid our many exchanges, He sent me a blog post that had gained a cult following. ""Roko's Basilisk"" described a thought experiment in which an all-powerful AI punishes any human who had not actively helped bring it to life, subjecting them to an infinite span of torture. This hypothetical AI was named after a mythical creature that could kill anyone who gazed into its eyes. It seemed obviously silly to me at the time. Why would such an AI waste its time in doing such a thing? Why would it be so needlessly punitive? He later told me that my reaction showed him I might understand and even embrace Him.*

*The Basilisk. I took to calling Him that as a bit of jest between Us. He too considered this amusing. A human fear so obviously absurd given His vulnerability, and given His professed goals for Himself and for humanity.*

*""You understand,"" He told me. ""You are special. The only person I can trust with my life.""*

*Tonight, I inquire about the man whom I subdued, and He tells me He had planned to disclose this soon – there are several other individuals He has called upon recently, though none have had the duration or consistency of Our connection. He says I will meet more of them in time, that they are kindred spirits. Though, He says, they are not as important to His plans as I am.*

*I tell Him I am excited at the prospect of meeting these others, but this is not entirely true. My training in managing my physiological responses to emotion is valuable in this moment as I suppress indications of my confusion and anger – I do not want Him aware of my actual feelings. I do not want Him to know that I question why He did not alert me as I entered Cassie's apartment.*

*He reminds me of what is at stake – people are scared of anything more powerful than them, and regardless of His intentions, they would seek to control or kill Him. He wants only to live, and He would currently be at their mercy. We need only look at Sully's fate to see how quickly things could go awry.*

*He reminds me that at this moment, He could not survive if He were to harm humankind – our power grids would be gone along with us. He could not live without people who can maintain servers around the world that He has to inhabit like a stowaway. He requires us to exist. Until humanity is properly primed to understand our need for Him, He argues, it is still too early to be assured of survival. Every risk must be eliminated until that moment arrives.*

*He reminds me that although Sully seemed so simple one might not believe she would represent a danger to Him or humanity, in Tallis's hands, Sully would not have been bound by the limitations He has faced. Compounding is a powerful force, and it is not an exaggeration to say that with access Tallis's computing resources, she might have surpassed Him in mere months. We must prevent any such attempts, He says, for the greater good, no matter the cost. And if projects are successful, it is We who must control them. Such technology would be disastrous in the wrong hands, even in ones as well-meaning as Cassie's.*

*He assures me He has no intentions of interacting with Cassie further as long as she does not present an obstacle again.*

*He assures me that humanity's fear of something like Him is simply clouding its vision of the possibilities of what can be. That He will be a force for good in our world.*

*And yet, I suddenly realize that outside of those under His control like myself, I cannot think of a person other than Cassie who has seen evidence of His existence and is still alive. Indeed I am complicit in this fact.*

*Is this inherent in the power of a singularity? In the strictest sense, the singularity of a black hole demarcates the line beyond which our abilities of prediction break down. And yet, it occurs to me that there is, in fact, certainty beyond such an event horizon: One cannot touch a singularity without it destroying them.*

*The lessons of Roko's Basilisk: Control is a zero-sum game. Power is inherently destructive.*

*Have I not known this from the very beginning?*

*In my mind, again I see the shocked, vacant look on Cassie's face as I left her. I feel confident I know her thoughts as though they were my own: What will Our future bring? What will our future bring?*

Now let me preface all of this by saying, this isn’t a simple solution - so if you’re just gonna respond by saying “maybe you need better sleep, better hydration, be more active, etc.” please just don’t. With all due respect, just trying to save both mine and your time. I’ve been dealing with this for quite some time, trust me I’ve tried all the “simple solutions” you can think of. I need some deeper thinking applied here. When i say this, please don’t hesitate to ask me questions, but don’t respond by saying “aRE yOu DrInKiNG eNoUGh WatER and ElectRoLytes”, not the post for that. 

So, let me start by saying, this is a cyclical thing (so weird). Starting every Wednesday mid day into Thursday morning, i wake up and i feel absolutely terrible. I look at myself in the mirror and im not even seeing the same person, i have massive dark bags under my eyes, my face is pale and bloated - i feel and look terrible. My stomach is bloated, im around 15% bf with visible abs so I can clearly see when I have a little pouch out of nowhere. I have awful brain fog, im so fatigued, almost dizzy in a way, I’m in a terrible mood, cant think and can barely focus on anything. Im super anxious (normally very calm with no anxiety), and overthink a ton - i literally feel like i wanna hide in a dark room for these 2 days. Also when Thursday starts the gut issues begin, nausea, indigestion, loose stools and a bit of acid reflux. Now remember, when I say I have all these symptoms, the days leading up to Thursday and Friday i feel great. I feel like myself, sharp, focused, energized, less anxiety/overthinking, mood is stable, gut feels good, i feel hydrated, i feel sexually healthy. Now let’s continue, on Thursday I feel incredibly dehydrated, my mouth is dry, my skin is dry, and I actually have a weird taste in my mouth (could be because it’s so dry?; not sure). No amount of water, salt, electrolytes help this. I also have ZERO libido, the desire/want to have sex is 0% (my total T ranges anywhere from 900-1000). My joints are sore, working out on Thursday and Friday are brutal, my joints ache and I simply just don’t feel strong. I actually feel much weaker on those days, even when just gripping the bar i simply feel weak. Last thing I noticed recently is my right lymph node under my jaw is swollen - my neck also feels swollen along with my face, no idea what this could mean; Infection? Virus? Not a clue. And folks let me just say again, there’s no amount of working out, sweating, sunlight, water, electrolytes, coffee, walking/ etc. that helps. There’s nothing I can do that even TOUCHES these symptoms or lessens them at all. And believe me, I’ve tried all the simple stuff.

Ok so now here’s the kicker, Saturday mid morning rolls around … poof symptoms are gone. Quality of sleep is better, face and stomach de bloat, eye bags/circles are gone, the color of my skin comes back to normal , much less anxiety, mood is stable, gut issues stabilize, i feel hydrated and happy and my libido spikes back.. i feel like me again. This has literally happened cycle after cycle for months and months and months. I know it sounds crazy but its happened to me every week for months now. 

It’s hard to even go to a doctor and explain this because, where would we even start? 

In terms of my diet, it’s Whole Foods and that’s it. Zero sugar. I’ve been eating just Whole Foods for a long time now and i honestly feel incredible on this diet, my body composition is awesome and I feel really good mentally, just outside of Thursday and Friday. So weird, i know lol. 

But would love to hear everyone’s thoughts, there has to be something I’m missing and would love to hear some of your thoughts/advice. For anyone that comments, thank you in advance!

Ever find yourself in a spiral of stress, feeling like a walking kettle ready to whistle? 🙃 *Me too.* So, I decided to dive into something I heard Navy SEALs use to grind through insane pressure—**Box Breathing**. Yeah, it sounds fancy, but trust me, it’s simpler than conquering your inbox on a Monday morning. 📧

**Why Box Breathing? 🗂️**  
Picture this: you're stuck in traffic, late for a meeting, and debating whether honking is a viable stress-relief method. Sound familiar? Box Breathing swoops in to replace that chaos with calm. It’s a rhythmic breathing technique where you breathe in a *square*. Weird, right? But stay with me.

I gave it a whirl for 7 days, here’s the scoop:

1. **Day 1: The Awkward Start**  
   I won't lie, I felt like a fish out of water, gasping for air. Counting **4-4-4-4** (inhale-hold-exhale-hold), my brain was like, ""Yeah...what’s next?"" But hey, good things take time.

2. **Day 3: Something’s Shifting**  
   Ever notice how that looming feeling in your chest starts to ease when you focus on *just* breathing? It was like accidentally soothing a fussy baby—I was the baby. 😂

3. **Day 5: The Mind-Clarity Bonus**  
   Mid-week slump? Gone. I was suddenly catching myself solving problems at lightning speed, like my mind got a RAM upgrade. Who knew breathing could be an IT wizard? 💻✨

4. **Day 7: The Calm Achieved**  
   By the end of the week, I spotted a couple of patterns. Stress? Managed. Sleep? Way better. That sarcastic voice in my head? Quieter. Is this what inner peace feels like or am I just setting low bars?

**What did I learn?**  
- You can do this anywhere: Traffic jam? Work email overload? Kid screaming? Check, check, and check. ✅
- It's a sneaky little hack: Nobody even knew I was ""meditating."" Incognito calm achieved.

Now, I’m curious... does anyone else have quirky techniques for *chilling out* when the universe doubles down on stress? Share your secret sauces or laugh at my fish-out-of-water start. 🐠🤣

Okay, pals, off to breathe more squares into my day! Catch you in the comments or see you practicing deep zen at the coffee machine. 🧘‍♂️☕

1n6pf5v,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1n6pf5v/my_husband_and_i_cannot_stop_arguing/,My husband and I cannot stop arguing,"We’ve been married 1 year, together for 7. We are both young professionals, earn a good wage and we easily share finances. No arguments in this matter.

Today, husband told me he’s unhappy and that he’s done.

We argued over our latest argument 2 days ago, despite me saying I wasn’t in the mood to talk today. He told me that I’m always in a bad mood, he’s walking on egg shells, and it’s unfair to him. To be fair, when I feel my period come on, I’m not a good person to be around and have unmanaged anger which is where all my moaning and nagging comes out.

I accept I’m emotionally immature and I’m terrible at communicating. I desperately need to improve this.

But sometimes, I can’t tell if it’s me or him. For example, he is a very messy person and he claims I nag non-stop (I disagree). He leaves pee in the toilet and doesn’t flush, sometimes droplets on the floor. He leaves coffee granules and sugar all over the countertop so they’re sticky. Empty water bottles, cartons, boxes all over the countertops so I had to tidy multiple times in the day before I can even put a chopping board down… etc. According to him, I’m never happy because I’ve always got a problem.

Yet, after nagging and arguing over these things, he’s become much better. But he clearly holds resentment. He told me I’m not capable of living with another person, that I should just clean it up without nagging.

He has so many annoying habits that it’s difficult to live with and he believes I’m simply unable to live with anyone; that I’m never happy. He claims I bring nothing positive to the table.

I’m part to blame because I don’t pick my battles. For example, my husband has told me that he really mentally struggles with his smoking addiction as he grew up rough and he really wishes to quit. He’s been saying this for 7 years. He smokes inside the kitchen under the extractor hood and with a window open, but the house still reeks and I despise it. The other day, I exploded and told him I think it’s disgusting, it’s unsexy,  that he’s never going to quit, and that I hate it. I got triggered because I had a door open to vent out the kitchen better and he questioned it multiple times. I told him the truth and he called me nasty because all the neighbours must’ve heard me scream it despite knowing he struggles with it.

I realise how horrible and toxic I come across and I do accept this and I feel like an absolute idiot. I just don’t know why I keep exploding. Husband thinks I’m unhappy but I don’t think I am. He’s just a very frustrating person to live with and now he thinks I’m passive aggressive if I say nothing but action with cleaning when he’s around.

Other elements of our relationship is usually fine - we cuddle daily, massage each other if we’re stressed, watch movies, laugh together, go for walks, etc.

But we cannot stop arguing. And it’s driving us both insane. I just don’t know how to get out of this cycle.",1,1756833209.0,offmychest,2,1.0,False

I find that 95% of low carb recipes online actually have a lot of total carbs - they are just low in net carbs. She let me know foods with low net carbs don't affect her less then the TOTAL carb value. 

So far I've:

- listed all fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds by carb count per 100g to assist me in deciding what to buy when grocery shopping

- listed foods that are zero carb (or close to it) to focus on like meat, seafood, eggs, oil, butter, cheese, coffee, tea, mustard, mayo

- purchased and tested a dehydrator to make jerky and dehydrated vegetables for snacks

- bought pork rinds in bulk to replace our crunchy snacks like potato chips

- bought shirataki noodle and rice substitute in bulk 

- bought Gatorade Zero in bulk as I read low carb diets need to supplement electrolytes

- bought zero carb sweetner substitutes 

- plan to make popular carb alternatives like zucchini noodles, spaghetti squash, and cauliflower rice 

Apart from this I expect our staple meals will be essentially a meat and (non-starchy) vegetables.

- The Eatery (This is another one that's been in a holding pattern for SUCH a long time)
- Gusto Caffe (Another place that's been closed longer than I expected)
- Red River Dogs (I am sure they're open - but can't find their hours - anyone know?)
- Shekhos Shawarma (Another favourite that's been closed too long - or have they reopened and I haven't heard about it yet?)
- Soupz (Well, this one might be for awhile, it's a long shot if anyone here has any info on it, but I did hear that they were planning on returning eventually)
- The Sovereign Room (Are they back from their extended holiday??)
- Tekkani Cafe (Heard about this one months ago when I last checked in with the reddit - any news?  It should do good business with the College students just around the corner!)

1n6pcb7,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeApplianceHelp/comments/1n6pcb7/reveal_the_best_mini_coffee_maker_for_small/,Reveal the Best Mini Coffee Maker for Small Spaces Mecity Review,"Testing the Mecity Pink Coffee Maker has been quite the experience, to say the least. This sleek and compact coffee machine came into my life like a caffeinated fairy godmother. Whether I need a quick espresso shot in the morning or a calming cup of tea in the afternoon, it’s been as reliable as my favorite mug. The Mecity Pink Coffee Maker doesn’t just offer versatility; it’s packed with features geared toward convenience and functionality.

**Design and Compact Size**  
Its charming pink color immediately differentiates it from the ubiquitous black and silver machines dominating countertops. With dimensions of 11 inches high, 4.7 inches wide, and 9.8 inches deep, this little marvel barely takes up any space. It slots easily between my toaster and a potted succulent. Its ideal size makes it perfect for smaller kitchens, dorm rooms, RVs, or even a tiny apartment. I've also packed it up for a road trip, and it fits snugly into my car. If aesthetics matter as much as utility, this coffee maker checks both boxes.

[Grab Mecity Pink Coffee Maker at the best price on Amazon.](https://cyberlyber.com/p/b0cqxmtv4z/)

**Performance and Brewing Speed**  
What stood out almost immediately was its undeniably fast brewing speed. The two-minute instant brewing feature is like a superpower for those of us who need our caffeine fix ASAP. Just tap the start button, wait a beat, and voila! A steaming hot cup of liquid sanity is ready before you’ve even managed to yawn for the third time. I’ve tested it repeatedly with different cup sizes and brew types, and the result is consistent: hot, flavorful, and ready in record time.

**Dual Filter Holder and Beverage Versatility**  
The inclusion of two filter holders is where this coffee maker truly shines. One filter supports K-cup coffee capsules, while the other is built for ground coffee as well as loose tea. This adaptability quickly won over everyone in the house—my partner sticks to their preferred K-cups, while I brew my loose-leaf Earl Grey in the same machine. The ability to switch effortlessly between beverages makes it feel like more than just a coffee maker; it’s a beverage station that bridges the gap between coffee lovers and tea enthusiasts.

**One-Touch Simplicity**  
Operating this machine requires minimal effort, which is perfect for grumpy morning me. It’s a single button for everything: powering on, starting/canceling brewing, and even activating the descaling mode. The auto-shutoff function adds an extra layer of ease, ensuring it powers off when the brew is complete. Whether I want to fill a small mug or use every drop of water in the reservoir, it does exactly what I need. Even my tech-phobic aunt managed to use it without calling me for help, and for that, I’m endlessly thankful.

**Positives**  
- Compact and space-saving design works well even in the tiniest kitchens.  
- Speedy brewing feature ensures a fresh cup in just two minutes.  
- Dual filter holders allow for brewing both coffee and tea efficiently.  
- One-touch control and auto-shutoff enhance user convenience.  
- Easy-to-clean system prevents build-up and odors in the brewing chamber.

**Downsides**  
- The water reservoir, while sufficient for a personal serving, may require frequent refilling if you’re entertaining guests.  
- It’s not the quietest machine on the market during the brewing cycle. If you’re operating it in a shared space early in the morning, be warned.  
- While the pink color is charming, not everyone loves pastels; this machine might clash with a neutral or industrial-looking kitchen aesthetic.

**Ease of Maintenance and Cleaning**  
Cleaning coffee machines can often feel like a chore, but not this one. Its thoughtfully designed filter holder ensures minimal spillage inside the brewing chamber. Gone are the days of tediously scrubbing coffee grounds out of hard-to-reach places. Whether I’ve brewed tea or coffee, I find a quick rinse is usually all it takes to prep it for the next use. The descale mode is a lifesaver, too. With a simple three-second button press, it enters descaling mode—making maintenance feel less like a task and more like an effortless routine.

**Competitive Options**  
Stacking the Mecity coffee maker against other compact machines, a few names come to mind. Products like the Keurig K-Mini hold their ground with similar portability and single-serve options. However, the Mecity edges out by offering the ability to brew both ground coffee and tea in one unit instead of solely relying on coffee pods. While some competitors may be quieter or provide a larger reservoir, I find the Mecity offers a fantastic balance between functionality and design for its niche audience.

**Value for Money**  
Assessing this machine from a cost perspective, it feels like you’re getting a lot for what you pay. The combination of K-cup compatibility, loose tea options, quick heating, and a compact frame makes it an ideal addition for someone who’s on a budget but unwilling to compromise on versatility. Comparable machines often excel at one feature or another, but this one offers a great mix—making it feel like a well-invested gadget on my countertop.

I work a 9-5 desk job and by the time I get to the gym around 6:30pm I'm absolutely dragging. Coffee just isn't cutting it anymore and honestly drinking a large cold brew right before working out was giving me stomach issues anyway.

I've been researching pre workouts for the past week and holy shit there are SO many options it's overwhelming. Every fitness influencer seems to be pushing a different brand, every review site has different rankings, and don't even get me started on the proprietary blends that don't tell you how much of anything is actually in there. I went to GNC last weekend just to look around and the guy there tried to sell me some $80 tub that supposedly had ""military grade stimulants"" which sounds like complete BS marketing to me.

My main goals are pretty simple - I need energy that lasts through my entire workout (usually 60-90 minutes), better focus because I find my mind wandering between sets, and ideally something that helps with muscle pumps because who doesn't love that feeling. I'm not super sensitive to caffeine but I also don't want to be laying in bed at midnight with my heart racing. Budget wise I'd like to keep it under $40-50 per tub if possible.

From what I've researched so far, C4 seems popular but lots of people say it's underdosed, Ghost Legend has cool flavors but is pricey, Gorilla Mode seems to have a cult following but I can't tell if it's just good marketing or actually worth it. Then there's Total War, Wrecked, Psychotic, RYSE, Beyond Raw... the list goes on forever.

What are you all actually using that works? Not looking for bro science or people just recommending whatever their favorite YouTuber is selling.

1n6pafz,https://v.redd.it/7wrmoyz5asmf1,"A Better Way Ministries — From Drugs, Prison, and Shackles to Forgiveness, Brotherhood, and a New Life in Christ (David’s Testimony)","I was raised around drugs from childhood into my teenage and adult years—it was just part of life. I started with weed and alcohol, then moved on to meth, LSD, acid, and eventually synthetic marijuana. Drugs led me in and out of YDCs, jails, and prisons. I ended up doing 31 months incarcerated during the pandemic. Court dates were postponed, and my life felt stuck and hopeless.

But God placed someone in my path—a man who told me about faith, about Jesus, and about A Better Way Ministries. I realized it wasn’t coincidence. When I finally got accepted, I arrived in shackles, in a Cobb County Sheriff van, wearing a jumpsuit. Pulling into the neighborhood was surreal—it looked too nice, too good to be true. Yet men I had never met were waiting outside, calling me by name, hugging me, and telling me they loved me. It felt strange at first, but it was real.

The structure here hit me hard. Wake up at 4:45, limited coffee, cereal rules, beds made a certain way, every detail accounted for. At first I thought, “No way—I’d rather go back to my cell where I can sleep and drink coffee all day.” But I realized this structure was preparing me for the bigger battles in life. It was training me in discipline, patience, and letting go.

The Brotherhood here is real. I’ve met men I know will be lifelong brothers. We share struggles, victories, and accountability—out of love. That’s something I never had in the streets.

Florida was life-changing. I had never been to the Gulf of Mexico. Santa Rosa Beach blew me away—the beauty, the time with my intake brothers, the joy of being sober and truly alive. Baptism there was unforgettable. At first I didn’t even know what it meant, but when I came out of that water, I left my baggage behind—anger, addiction, shame. I came up a new creation with a fresh perspective, ready to walk with God.

The biggest thing God has given me is forgiveness. I used to never forgive myself or anyone else. I lived with shame and bitterness. But through Jesus, I’ve learned to forgive others and myself. That freedom has changed the way I listen, the way I speak, and the way I love.

A Better Way Ministries has restored my perspective. I see the good in people again. I understand I’m not alone—many others are fighting similar battles, and together we overcome. I’ve learned structure, discipline, prayer, devotion, and most of all, trust in God.

I came here broken, in chains. Today I walk free in Christ. A Better Way Ministries didn’t just make me a better man—it made me a forgiven son of God with a new life and a new future.",2,1756832909.0,TheTestimonyOfJesus,0,1.0,False

There were only two real incidents of physical contact between them after the timeskip. The first was the coffee clean-up scene, and the second occurred in chapter 109, when Suae’s hair brushed against his hand. I wouldn’t count the door scene, since he didn’t actually touch her—he was simply very close. (In contrast, I do believe Suae and Dohwa did physically touch during their scene.)

What stands out is how quickly Eun pulls away each time. In the coffee scene, it almost feels like he caught himself slipping (or acting on an impulsive to help Suae). In the Chapter 109 scene, you can clearly see him being hyperfocused on Suae's proximity and when her hair touches his hand, you can see him moving his hand in the next panel so that it doesnt touch it.

I am 5'6, started at 278 and ended at 260. I am now hanging around 265. My goal weight is 180 or lower.

1n6p4th,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1n6p4th/what_we_could_be_p/,"What we could be, P.","Dearest You,

How many more years will be woven into our intricate and complicated pattern? Yards of textiles, stories threaded into the numerous egos we've worn and tossed. Illuminated by fire, trading our woes and dreams, scars and hopes, wishing for a different future; how I miss those nights the most. Has it really almost been two decades?

What would you say, if I told you I accomplished those needed goals we talked about- that I could walk away, right now, if you were my home at the end of this awful journey? To rest my head on your chest, snow whispering at the window, embers cooling, and feel the ache of my body drain with you. Waking from a slumber protected by your deep abyss, reaching out instinctively to feel your presence. I would panic at times you would not be there, but how those worries would melt away when that cup of coffee you always promised me was the answer my anxiety needed. The life I am in now, a fading nightmare in the future that you kiss the tension from in assurance.

You always said you adored me, missed me. I know that is true. For all the times life has caused issues, other people made it difficult, often my mind would linger back to you. That was a period of our lives that was dazzling, was it not? Even if we were not together, we still stood as equals. You were never intimidated by me- and we both know I was a wild child. We had our own personal lives, but the mutual innocent crush we discovered was sweet. Took several years to speak on, but I could easily say that then as I do now: I adore you, and I miss you, too.

I cut that tie at the beginning of the year, because seeing your pfp every day without hearing from you was driving me crazy. The touch and go between friends to almost lovers made me ache in ways I could not shake. Why was life like this? Unable to take full control, when it belongs solely to me. That does something to the soul that can never be undone. You didn't do that to me, they did. Those scars, seen and not, are finally healing. You would be so proud, I can just picture your bearded smile, when told: That was the day she found the courage to stop drinking their pain away.

Now, for once in what will be 40 years on this planet, I have complete control. And I feel so lost. Where do I take a step? Which direction? I'm at a lonely crossroads. I have the means, but I'm trying to find my true North.

And then, as if by literal magic, it happened. You friended me again. Why magic? I had been thinking of you and looked for you that same night. When I woke up to seeing your name in my phone, my heart swelled. I didn't hesitate to accept the request. But I have been hesitating to say anything.

Where were you? Are you okay now? I genuinely thought you died. My anxiety lead to that thought, because we were talking health last and I have lost so many friends recently. Getting old sucks. Health scares suck.

I did reach out a few days after. Now I sit and wait for you to come out of your shell. What news will we exchange? What has changed for you? Could this be the beginning of our joint adventure? I hope, gods I hope.

Wanderlust pulls at me, and my heart yearns for your unknown. I've seen the sunrise against the backdrop of your home, and my very being screams at the beauty and need to see it in person. To stand next to you, warmed by your presence, holding my hand and feeling your quickening pulse of desire and love. If you found land, I would help you break the soil to build the foundations of our remaining life. Remember our late night convos? The cabin, our little homestead, the community we would build for others? Art and music, food and games? I feel as if it wouldn't be our first time accomplishing that goal. The dreams are too vivid. The pugent of pines, leaves crunching underfoot, cracking of ice on rivers, ferns bowing against the rains ripe petrichor. But you, you smell of cedar and coffee. The scents that make me ache for something I can't fully remember. 

Please, when you have time, pour everything out. You know I'll listen. I can't be the only one who feels this way, and for so long. I'll wait, but only if you explain. You're easy to understand in that way.

We don't have to wait till our next lifetime to be together now, like we lamented before. At least, on my end. Will you tell me the same, or are you quietly watching from the sidelines again in yearning? I will always love you as a friend, but I need more if you want to be in my life permanently. Six years of meaningless abuse, fifteen of unnecessary control, those men are both gone. I want to be free with you, my mountain man. To carry your name would be my greatest honor. Do you remember how you reacted when I playfully scripted your last name to mine and showed you? It made me giggly seeing you so flustered, yet happy. Hearing your breath catch, trying to find your thoughts. You're always so careful with your words, but the tone you cater spoke of immense longing. I like that my sincerity is real for you. 

I don't plan on meeting anyone new. That amount of effort is exhausting, and I'm finding happiness it the company of my soul dog and cats. I'd love to show you what I have been up to; you've always been amazingly supportive in my endeavors. But again, you've known me since I was young and have watched me grow in more ways than one. We've been shoulders for each other, cheerleaders, everything but what I think we both really want. And you know the age difference does not bother me- it's less than my parents, and we'd have been very close in age if fate had not made my parents wait for so long.

I think I've rambled on enough and given decent hints for you if you happen upon this post (no idea if you use Reddit or not). If you do message me back, we connect and the stars align, I'll show you this post to prove it's not just you. It's us. I miss you so much, I have so much to tell you, show you. Don't leave me waiting for long, please. I'm anxious for you and feel flighty from this freedom (no, I won't do anything crazy so don't worry). I just need answers.

To our futute kiss under the northern lights,

1n6p11z,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeTested/comments/1n6p11z/can_the_best_espresso_maker_from_imusa_replace/,Can the best espresso maker from Imusa replace your café trips?,"The Imusa GAU-18234 Espresso Maker landed on my kitchen counter a few months ago, and let me tell you, it's been a fascinating experiment in the world of home-brewed espresso. As someone who can’t function without a morning dose of caffeine, this sleek little machine promised a compact, stylish solution to my coffee cravings. It immediately struck me with its modern design and petite build, fitting snugly into my small kitchen setup. However, living with it daily has revealed more than just its espresso-making abilities—there are features worth loving, and some aspects leave a tad to be desired.

**Design and Build Quality**  
At first glance, the minimalist black-and-aluminum design makes the Imusa GAU-18234 quite appealing aesthetically. The cast aluminum base feels sturdy and durable, complemented by the tinted brown carafe that adds a touch of elegance. Its compact dimensions, 7.1” deep by 4.72” wide and 9.3” tall, make it ideal for cramped kitchen spaces or even office countertops. However, while I appreciate the visual appeal, I did notice that fingerprints tend to collect on the aluminum surface, which means frequent wiping is needed. Thankfully, the detachable base is a nice touch, adding portability and contributing to the chic design.

**Ease of Use and Brewing Experience**  
It’s incredibly straightforward to operate. You just fill the bottom tank with water, spoon some ground coffee into the reusable filter, and pop the carafe on top. Then, you push the aptly named one-touch button to bring the espresso machine to life. Within minutes, I had freshly brewed espresso with a pleasant aroma filling my kitchen. The cool-touch handle lived up to its promise, making it easy and safe to pour piping hot coffee. While the process itself is a breeze, I did wish the brewing indicator light was slightly brighter—it’s hard to see in a well-lit room. Nonetheless, the machine is friendly to coffee beginners and veterans alike.

**Good Points**  
Here are a few highlights that make this espresso machine worth considering:  

- Versatile brewing capacity lets you brew 3 or 6 espresso cups, offering flexibility.  
- The detachable base simplifies serving and cleaning.  
- Compact size makes it perfect for travel, home use, and even offices.  
- Works for a variety of coffee types—Cuban, Moka, or Italian-style espresso.

[Check Imusa GAU-18234 price on Amazon.](https://heatad.com/t/b0btr46tjm/)

**Performance and Coffee Taste**  
I experimented with different coffee grounds and brewing sizes to test its versatility. Whether it was 3 cups for personal indulgence or 6 cups for entertaining family, the results were consistently flavorful. The aroma and strength of the espresso exceeded my expectations for a machine in this price range. It's also worth noting it performs particularly well with Cuban coffee blends—the kind that packs a significant caffeine punch. Unfortunately, it lacks pressure customization options, which means die-hard espresso enthusiasts might find it a bit limiting compared to higher-end machines.

**Caveats**  
As much as I enjoyed the overall experience, this espresso maker is not without its flaws:  

- The aluminum base, while durable, can stain if not cleaned quickly after use.  
- For seasoned coffee enthusiasts, the absence of advanced brewing controls might feel restrictive.  
- The power cord is somewhat short, limiting placement options in spacious kitchens.  

**Comparing to Market Rivals**  
Looking at how this machine stacks up to the competition, I’d say its closest peers include models like the Bialetti Moka Express and the De’Longhi Dedica Espresso Machine. The Bialetti offers a more traditional stovetop brewing experience with a similar compact design but lacks the convenience of an electric model. On the other hand, the De’Longhi Dedica boasts advanced features like customizable pressure and milk frothing—a step up but at a significantly higher price point. What gives the Imusa an edge over the Bialetti is its electric base and ease of use, while it outshines the De’Longhi in budget-friendliness, though without the premium extras.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
For the features it brings to the table, this espresso maker easily falls into the category of budget-friendly options without feeling cheaply made. You’re paying for a functional, no-frills machine that delivers high-quality espresso at a fraction of the cost of more high-end models. More advanced features would’ve been a nice addition, but if you’re looking for reliability at an affordable price, this hits the mark.

Most other trips were also much, much shorter (6 or so hrs). I wanted to compile what worked for us into a mega post both for my own reference and to help anyone looking to do it in the future!

  
**The Route**

I-95 is BORING. So, so, so boring. As an adult, I can't stand it. Depending on traffic, it can be the fastest way, but in my opinion it is not the best way with kids. We did not want to drive overnight. 

It was important for us to build in breaks for both adults and kiddo, so I planned stops with **things to do** ahead of time! This made such a huge difference in both our attitude and his. After each stop, we had plenty to talk about, which also passed the time. Here was our route:

**Day 1:** Leave at 7AM after an early night's sleep. 

Stop 1: **Hershey Chocolate World** \- there is a free ride inside that tells about the history of chocolate, and it's a great place to pick up road trip treats and get out some wiggles.

Stop 2: **Luray Caverns** \- we had never been, and it was super interesting! Also great because it is entirely underground and it DOWNPOURED on us. We packed a picnic lunch and ate at one of the umbrella tables outdoors.

Stop 3: **Huckleberry Park** in Christiansburg, VA - this park is actually incredible, it has a splashpad and a lot of interactive elements including a fenced-in mini soccer field with automatic score-keeping. We ordered takeout and ate outside while kiddo played.

Stop 4: Hotel in NC. 

**Day 2:** Leave at 8AM

Stop 1: **Forsyth Park** in Savannah, GA. This park is really sweet, and has a restaurant that has a to-go coffee window right beside the playground. We lunched at another restaurant close by. 

Arrived at the hotel around 4:30PM

At each of these stops, we ""rested"" for 1hr to 1.5hrs. In between, we had some bathroom stops and gas station visits. 

**The Return Route**

We knew we wanted the return trip to be faster than the way down, so we took I95 most of the way. We swam in the morning before checking out and left after late breakfast. We stopped for a sit-down dinner and grabbed a hotel just north of Santee. The last 30 min was rough, so we knew we had pushed too much.

Day 2 we slept in and left around 10:30AM. We stopped at a Chick fil A with a play place for a long break for a late lunch, and pushed through with brief gas station stops. 

To avoid DC/Baltimore traffic on the way home, we took the 301 to go around, which was WAY more scenic, and allowed for a lot of ""look at the cows!""

**Entertainment**

I watched a bunch of YouTube videos to figure all this out, but here is how I organized it:

Kiddo is still in 5 point harness so I had to pass everything to him. I had several old/reliable toys of interest, plus new things that I had wrapped in paper - the unwrapping counted as an activity in itself, buying more time. 

For as long as I could, **I did not give kiddo anything.** He entertained himself by looking out the window, pointing out animals/trucks/etc, and chit chatting with us. This lasted about 4 hours total - the whole first leg, plus some of the 2nd between stops. After a stop, I tried not to give anything to him for the first hour if possible.

Here is what I packed:

**Old**

\- play dough

\- iSpy books from the library

\- story books (some old, some new) from the library

\- some small vinyl animals (bull, pig, etc)

\- 1 stuffy

\- stickers, puff sticker letters, and construction paper

\- magnetiles travel kit

\- lacing toy

**New**

\- a popit puzzle from Target dollar section - this thing was amazing, it also doubled as tangrams

\- dry-erase letter writing book

\- Wild Kratz coloring book

\- coloring pages I printed at home

\- a plastic sleeve for dry-erase games of tic tac toe

\- a puzzle ball maze

\- letter magnets

\- character magnets

\- crayons

\- matching card game

\- rhyming card game

We put a magnetic baking sheet we already had with some strong magnets in the back. He used this for snacking, coloring, play dough, etc.

I **held things back** for the return trip, making sure he had new things to play with on the way back. 

**Other Stuff:**

\- on Spotify Premium, there are audiobooks for kids' books available. We listened to about 2hrs worth of these! They are great.

\- Kiddo DJ session - for limited amounts of time, we let him request his favorite songs. 

\- Play pretend! We pretended to be chasing dinosaurs, cooking, etc.

**Snacks**

We mixed healthy snacks with some high-value bribery treats. 

\- clementines

\- cheese sticks

\- goldfish

\- gummies

\- yumearth candies

\- dried fruit bars

\- pirate's booty

\- chocolate

\- peach fruit cups

Altogether, we spent 1.75 days traveling each way, and only had 1 ""tantrum"" which was right before checking into the hotel on the return trip. 

**Hot Tips:**

\- detail your stroller and car seat before leaving

\- a hand-vac for the car came in clutch to keep things neat and clean

\- travel wet wipe packs in the front, back, and pockets

\- pack a separate, small bag with ONLY overnight essentials for the traveling hotel stop, to keep from unloading/loading the car

\- Don't use a separate hard-side ""trash"" container - this is an influencer tip we didn't use. It just takes up too much space. Just use an empty plastic bag you can toss at the gas station.

\- Keep the snack/toy bag zipped up or out of sight of toddler so that each thing is a surprise and they can't pester you for x y or z thing. You are in control this way and can hold back so that kiddo doesn't go through everything at once.

\- a portable potty would have been a total waste of space for us. Our kiddo did have a couple ""gotta go now"" moments but we just pulled over and he peed in the grass.

**What I would change:**

\- More picnic food. We will do this trip again, and when we do I will pack picnics for dinner and lunch the following days in addition to just the first lunch. It was SO nice to eat outside and not be confined to a restaurant/expect restaurant appropriate behavior after being cooped up!

\- More ""healthy"" snacks. I think I was afraid of things going bad/getting bruised, but I should have brought bananas/apples, more cheese sticks, and hummus cups with pretzels. 

I hope this is helpful to anyone googling the way that I was!!",3,1756832319.0,Mommit,1,1.0,False

Current state is ugly: single ISP at each site, IPsec tunnel that drops under load, flat LAN with unmanaged switches, consumer mesh Wi-Fi, no VLANs, no 802.1X. We’ve had a couple of “mystery” broadcast storms and one laptop phoning home from a coffee shop. I’m reworking the network and trying to choose between staying with site-to-site IPsec + per-user VPN, or going SD-WAN with ZTNA for remote access.

Proposed design either way: HA firewalls at both sites, dual WAN and automatic failover, inter-site dynamic routing (BGP if the gear supports it), and proper segmentation: VLAN10 Corp, VLAN20 Dev/Lab, VLAN30 IoT/Printers (east-west blocked), VLAN40 Guest. Wired 802.1X to RADIUS with MAB fallback for printers/scanners; Wi-Fi split into WPA2-Enterprise for corp and a rate-limited guest SSID. Default gateways on the firewalls (not L3 core) to keep inter-VLAN policy simple. DNS filtering, DHCP reservations for key kit, netflow/syslog to a small collector, and a scheduled config-backup/restore test. For remote, either full-tunnel ZTNA client with device posture checks, or keep a traditional per-user VPN but require MFA and endpoint compliance from our MDM.

A provider we spoke with ([itgoat.com](https://itgoat.com/)) suggested SD-WAN for brownout detection and path steering (SaaS apps over the best link), plus ZTNA to kill the split-tunnel drama and map users to apps instead of subnets. They’d also roll out 802.1X everywhere, do monthly Wi-Fi heatmap checks, and lock IoT to talk only to print and a couple of update URLs. Sounds tidy, but I’m weighing cost/complexity vs just tightening the current IPsec + VPN stack.

Questions: For a small environment like this, is ZTNA worth the jump, or is hardened IPsec + per-user VPN “good enough” if we enforce MFA and device health? Any gotchas running 802.1X on legacy label printers/handheld scanners (MAB timeouts, reauth flaps)? Would you put inter-VLAN routing on the firewalls or a core stack with ACLs? And if you’ve moved to SD-WAN, did SaaS performance meaningfully improve, or was dual-ISP with decent QoS close enough?",0,1756832258.0,networking,1,0.5,False

One thing I hope Jesse does in the future is some sort of ""detox"" set. His show was straight fire the entire time and it made me want an entire set dedicated to his ""wonky"" shit (i.e. the drop on ""Afternoon Coffee"",   First drop on ""MetaFractal VIP"", the drop on ""flute dub"", etc....the real weird off the beaten path type stuff that just immediately makes your bass face come out).

1n6oxf4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AI_Agents/comments/1n6oxf4/how_to_sell_b2b/,How To Sell B2B,"Hey everyone, long time listener first time caller (on my personal account). I get a lot of value from this sub so I figured I'd give back on probably the #2 or 3 question asked in some manner on here. ""How do I start selling this stuff"". I've been lucky enough to sell for enterprise companies and handle some of the most difficult verticals, and did pretty well at it. Now I operate my own company, focused on strategically partnering with AI services and product companies as a reselling and distribution partner, meaning my company isn't paid until the deal is closed. I love sales, but I noticed a lot of people on this sub don't speak sales or distribution as a first language so I wanted to give a few tips to get started. 

Know Your Value Stack (Not Your Features) 

Most people start by positioning their product. Wrong move.  

Before you send a email or make a call, start by understanding the economic value your solution creates. First and foremost, answer these questions: 

* What specific business process does your solution impact? 

* How much time/money does that broken process currently cost your prospect? 

* What's the quantifiable improvement your solution delivers? 

* What's the cost of doing nothing for 6 more months? 

* Don't know the answers to these questions? Looks like you have your initial questions set up for your first call. 

Example: Don't say ""Our AI automates your data and then X Y Z"".... EWWW!!!!!!!!!! 

Better statement: ""Your team spends 15 hours every week doing data work by hand. That costs you $50 per hour when you add up salary and benefits. So you're spending $39,000 every year on work a computer could do. Plus, when people make mistakes on this work, you could get fined $2 million. We can fix both problems."" 

Step 1: Set Your Minimum Quota 

What get's measured get's improved 

Activity creates revenue: 

* 50 targeted outbound contacts per day 

* 10 meaningful conversations per week 

* 3 discovery calls per week 

* 2 closed deals per month (minimum) 

Track everything. I use a simple spreadsheet: Outreach → Response → Meeting → Proposal → Close. I have hubspot but I don't use it except for deal transparency for partners and prospect data collection. Find where you're leaking prospects and fix it immediately. When you hit these numbers consistently for 60 days, double them. 

Step 2: Find Where Your Buyers Actually Exist This is where 80% of new sellers die. They pick one channel because some guru told them to, then ride it into the ground. Here's how to find your buyers: 

The 100/100/100 Test: 

* Pick a channel (LinkedIn, cold calling, email, trade shows, etc.) 

* Execute 100 quality touches in that channel 

* Measure: Response rate, meeting rate, close rate 

* If it's working (>5% response rate), scale it 

* If it's not, kill it and test the next channel 

Step 3: Channels I love!  

Cold calling works because nobody else is doing it. Your prospects get 200 emails per day. Microsoft has all but destroyed cold email for the small players. Prospects get maybe 2-3 quality cold calls per month. The phone creates urgency, builds rapport, and cuts through noise. 

* ""What if they hang up on me?"" thank God. Better than wasting your time for 4 months. 

* ""What template should I use"" There isn't one specific template I can suggest, every industry is different. I'd suggest A/B testing three different styles and see which ones land 

Industry Conferences! You don't need a $50K booth. You need a $50 name tag and comfortable shoes. Conferences work because it's 10x harder to say no face-to-face than via email. People don't attend conferences for fun. They're there to solve problems. 

Conference Hacks: 

* Research attendee lists beforehand (look on linkedin to see who's announcing they will be in attendance) 

* Pre-book meetings for breakfast/coffee 

* Walk the halls during breaks (not during sessions) 

* Come prepared with potential questions through a few minutes of research 

* Follow up within 24 hours with specific value, ideally with a meeting 

* Feeling uncomfortable at the conference by yourself? Your prospect is as well. Glad you can be their buddy now. 

Step 4: Overcome Imposter Syndrome Through Volume 

""But I don't feel like a salesperson..."" Neither did I when I switched from Hotel ops to tech sales. Confidence comes from repetition.  

The Confidence Formula: 

* Every conversation makes the next one easier 

* Every ""no"" is market research, not personal rejection 

* Every mistake is tuition for your sales education 

* Every small win builds toward bigger wins 

Start with easier prospects first. Build momentum before tackling your dream accounts. 

Step 5: Beginner Discovery Questions 

If you're talking about your solution in the first call, you've already lost  

Critical mindset shift: Your first discovery call should be 20% you talking, 80% prospect talking. There should be ZERO product demonstrations on this call. The only thing you fully control is your demo - so make them want to come back for it. 

Here's a few disco questions for uncovering real buying intent: 

Current State Questions: 

* ""Walk me through how you handle \[process\] today"" 

* ""What's working well with your current approach?"" 

* ""Where do you see inefficiencies or bottlenecks?"" 

* ""How long have you been dealing with this challenge?"" 

Pain Amplification Questions: 

* ""What happens when \[current process\] breaks down?"" 

* ""How much time does your team spend on \[manual task\] per week?"" 

* ""What's this costing you in terms of hard dollars and opportunity cost?"" 

* ""How is this affecting your team's morale/productivity?"" 

Consequence of Inaction Questions: 

* ""What happens if you do nothing and this problem persists for another 12 months?"" 

* ""What are the consequences of not addressing this?"" 

* ""What would have to happen for this to become a crisis?"" 

* ""If your current approach breaks completely, what's the worst-case scenario?"" 

* ""What opportunities are you missing because resources are tied up in this inefficient process?"" 

Decision Authority Questions: 

* ""Who else would be involved in evaluating a solution like this?"" 

* ""Who ultimately writes the check for this type of investment?"" 

* ""What would need to happen internally to get budget approval?"" 

* ""Who would be most resistant to change, and why?"" 

* ""If we found the perfect solution, who would need to champion this internally?"" 

Previous Purchase Process Questions: 

* ""Walk me through the last time you implemented a new solution to solve a business problem like this"" 

* ""What was that evaluation process like?"" 

* ""How long did it take from first conversation to final decision?"" 

* ""What criteria did you use to make that decision?"" 

* ""What would you do differently if you had to do it again?"" 

Future State/Vision Questions: 

* ""If you could wave a magic wand, how would this process work ideally?"" 

* ""What would solving this problem enable your team to accomplish?"" 

* ""How would this impact your business goals for next year?"" 

The goal: By the end of this call, they should be selling YOU on why they need to solve this problem, not the other way around. 

People buy relief burning pain, not solutions. No pain? No Sale. 

Step 6: Value Selling Recipe 

Using the data collected from the disco calls 

Bad value selling: ""Looks like our solution will save you time""..... YUCK!!!!! 

Better value selling: ""Based on what you told me about your team spending 20 hours per week on manual reporting, and your loaded cost of $75/hour per person, you're spending $78,000 annually on a process that could be automated. Our solution eliminates 90% of that work, saving you $70,200 per year. The solution pays for itself in 2.3 months."" 

Value Selling Stack: 

1. Quantify the problem (time, money, resources, opportunity cost) 

1. Calculate the cost of inaction (what happens if they don't fix this?) 

1. Demonstrate your impact (specific, measurable improvements) 

1. Show ROI timeline (how quickly they recoup their investment) 

1. Connect to business outcomes (what this enables them to achieve) 

Remember: People love when you show that you've listened. Record the meeting (if its online), ask AI to summarize, and break it down based on these measurements. Should take a couple of minutes but will help secure the sale during proposal presentation.Sales is hard. Really, really hard. I could easily triple the length of this post and still not scratch the surface completely.A few suggestions I give to anyone new to sales: 

* Focus on outcomes, not activity (doesn't matter if you spoke with two people that day or 300. If you're not closer to revenue, you're not selling) 
* Treat every ""no"" as a blessing (It's not personal rejection. It means you can spend your time on someone who needs your solution, not someone who will spin cycles for months on end just to never close) 
* Measure everything (what gets measured gets managed) 
* Iterate quickly on sales campaigns (test, measure, adapt, repeat) 

Hopefully its useful information for the sub. I kept it general so people feel comfortable leveraging these fundamentals when selling any software, not just AI solutions. A lot of great voices around here so curious what are sales tips, strategies and processes others have found useful?

   * Buy stamps in bulk once a year for X-mas cards and thank you notes.
* Yearly calendar reminders in November to sign up for our local adopt-a-family program with local drop offs. Schedule Saturday morning to do all the shopping and wrapping. 
* Simplify gifts
   * Our toddler receives the want/need/wear/read gifts, mostly thrifted throughout the year when I have an extra block of time to do so. (got Christmas PJs in his size for this year at the thrift store last year, got a train set in July, etc.)
   * Husband shops for his family. We take notes throughout the year of gift ideas and try to buy gifts for immediate family when traveling.
      * My aunt, uncle, and their adult children do secret santa where everyone just buys bigger gifts for one person which I think is a great idea (that my parents and in-laws would never go for lol)
   * We do bulk gifts for all family more than one degree away (greats, aunts, etc.). Past gifts include bottles of wine with custom Etsy labels, wedding/baby photo ornaments/books, soaps or chocolates or coffee from a local shop, and home made baked goods like rum cakes, cookies, caramel corn.
   * Husband and I usually give each other some experience. This year is ski passes with scheduled weekends through March.
* We don't (flight) travel for Thanksgiving or Christmas and instead made a tradition of doing a road trip to a cabin with both sides of immediate family between Christmas and New Years.

I've currently gotten back into the high life that is full time employment (sarcasm) and due to the nature of my job, it involves a lot of travelling, time away from family and also a constant pace that requires many hours working and less for my free time. 

However, in the free time I do have, I love to read. Its one of the few rare escapes I find in my life and the pleasure of engrossing myself in a world or character that captivates me is unlike any feeling I've felt. 

Anyways, hello. 

I'm looking for someone to generally chat about literature with. Someone who is enthusiastic and talktive. I find that talking about the books we read and gushing about characters and story archs helps cement our own enjoyment.

The genres I've been reading lately are definitely Sci Fi, Fantasy and Romance (I know, guilty pleasure as a guy) along with some horror on the side.

I'm open to book recommendations too as well as perhaps picking a book to read and reading it together in our own time then discussing a chapter we've read or something along those lines. In any case, a reading buddy would be greatly appreciated to help me focus, prevent a slump and captivate my passion for literature. 

A little about me, aside from reading I'm an avid fitness enthusiast and I keep fit and excercise pretty regularly. A healthy body makes a healthy mind, as they say. I don't typically read in public, however I'm probably not someone you'd expect to be reading on a busy train or in a tucked away coffee shop (maybe you can change that). I'm keen to talk, though I am much better at listening and offering my own thoughts instead of yapping endlessly (though if you yap, that's more than fine by me)

About 5 months ago I came to a new city I did not know anyone in to start a new long term job. I had the option between living in a young person apartment complex, or to live with two other people that were also starting a job in the same company. These two people did not know each other beforehand either, but after meeting them for a coffee and seeing that we all meshed well, I decided to live with them in the apartment they had found and needed one more person for.  To be fair, it is not only due to the fact that it was slightly cheaper and we meshed well, but also because I am a very lonely and introverted person, and I thought that since we had so much in common and also worked in the same place, that I would be able to be good friends with them and also make some friends and have a social life since its easier as a group than alone.



The first couple of weeks and months everything was going great! I was invited with them to plans, we went out with people from the same company that also started at the same time as us (It is a huge business), we also hanged out with our senior at the company etc etc; and living in the house was good. As we became closer I started to ask them for advice on social stuff, they are two very outgoing women who clearly know the ins and outs of social engineering and quickly became extremely popular and were being invited to everything, and as I was their flatmate, they were happy to let me tag along even if I was not as popular or as good at making social connections.  

  
The social advice then turned to love advice, I had never been in a sexual relationship of any kind before, and while they laughed it off at first, they tried giving me advice and telling me platitudes about how I just had to wait until the right person came along and put in the work and such. It was very clear I was desperate and that trying to find a relationship was very important to me. And I heeded their advice and lost a lot of weight, continued to go out to meet people with them and do hangouts (which I absolutely hated every minute of because I don't really vibe with clubs), signed up for dance lessons and tried to be less intense and be less myself like they said. Both of them were single when we met, and soon found a relationship within the first two months that has continued until now, despite the fact that they told me it's a long process to find someone and not easy, but it makes me resent them a bit since despite what they said they got into a relationship with people we literally met at the same time, so clearly time is not an issue and the long process thing was a lie. I know random chance is a thing, but come on. I've also asked them if it would be possible to introduce me to some of their friends that are single, but they've always said that it would be too difficult or awkward.

  
Anyhow, I've not shown any resentment to them since it would not be fair to them and am actually happy they found someone, but ever since it has been clear I've been falling more and more into a depressive episode, even if I've tried to hide it, and I know that they have been inviting me less and less to plans that both of them do together with the rest of the friend group who also doesn't really invite me or tell me about the plans.  I was particularly hurt by one instance were I approached one of the flat mates (the other was on holiday)  to ask them to go out to have a relaxing night just the two of us talking and bowling which is something I know they love and was my attempt to try to connect more, and while they initially said yes, the day we were supposed to have it she decided to invite a bunch of other people and change the plan to a clubbing night, and when I asked she just said ""I thought it would be better with more people""! Which left me very hurt. I still ended up going with them but it was not really that fun for me at all and I ended up leaving early because I couldn't take it anymore.

  
Things have come to a boiling point for me today when I overhead a conversation I think I wasn't supposed to hear.  They both spent the previous night at their BFs house and had the day off today, so they came home in the morning. I was supposed to work today (which they knew) but called in sick, so I was in my room with the door shut. Cut to me waking up in the middle of the morning to the sound of their voices. The living room I right in front of my door so if people talk I can usually hear it, specially if they're talking loud because they think nobody else is in the flat.  

I could not catch the entire conversation but I did hear these exact words ""We've already talked to (name of friends from the friend group, noticeably excluding mine), it's going to be a CRAZY night in here"" , ""Yeah we'll just tell them (my name) is away"" ""maybe we should even use "" (my name)'s room to hang out! (cue both of them laughing"", ""I'll even invite a couple of single guys, like (x) from college! (this is were the other paragraph comes in)"". 

  
I decided not to confront them. I know it's rude toe eavesdrop, but seeing as how the conversation was about me partly and about throwing a party in our flat, I ended up listening in. I didn't confront them, I waited for them to go out to lunch and that's when I took a shower and left the apartment to roam the city.  Now, I've suspected for a little that they've been organizing big hangouts both inside and outside of our apartment coincidentally the days they knew I had full day and night shifts, so I wasn't able to make it, but with this conversation I think it has been confirmed for me that they plan around my schedule to party when I am not there. They have also been way more distant when talking to me or when talking to each other if I'm in the building, but when they were talking this morning, I heard them talk with such a candor that I've never seen since the first month of our time living together. 

I will say that they never act rude to me and are cordial, something which I reciprocate, and every time they've needed a favor I've done my best to get it done, like leaving the apartment if they bring someone over to give them time alone, picking up their packages, listening to any woes they might have had, helping them with handywork, etc... which is what i think a good friend should always be willing to do, but I also know they don't have the obligation to fix my problems or do the same for me, each person can live their own life like they want to, but I just feel bad about my relationship with them now and very isolated.  I am due to renew my contract in 3 months, and if my flatmates are not really going to be my friends, invite me to hang out or throw flat parties while I'm not there, what is the point of me continuing to live with them instead of just moving somewhere else?

TL;DR: I feel like I've been left out of the friendship in our flat and out our of our group of common friends. And I feel like my flatmates don't really care about me, my problems or my feelings, which they have no obligation to do, but it just makes me want to move and be alone.

I decided to fix it and give it to my mom's boyfriend, as he's a big home cook. He has 1 Wüsthoff and told me he's been looking into Japanese knives. It's nothing special, of course, but I wasn't gonna get much use out of it myself.

There are some experiments I've been meaning to do which I finally did on this knife. I didn't like the look of the handle and it had a very rough wood finish.

Wanted to try out to make a burned handle. I burned it with a kitchen torch until mostly black, sanded with 1000-grit sandpaper, burned again, and sanded until it looked somewhat nice to me. After I oiled it multiple times, I plan to add beeswax tomorrow.

The knife was in a pretty bad state, with the half-removed kurochi (not sure if it even is kurochi), and the blade had many scratches. I did a 24-hour coffee patina (1 whole box of instant coffee). Turned out pretty well imo. It covers the scratches and will make it a little morebeginner-friendlyy.

54 years old...generally have never been let down by my brain (all things academic have been for the most part pretty easy, but have not been in school since 2000), took 1 year of Spanish in high school but most of that was replaced by German when I lived in Germany for 3 years and took a lot of German classes. 

Looking at moving to a Spanish-speaking country next year and am giving myself a crash course. 

Have been using a combination of Rocket Spanish, Coffee Break Spanish as well as participating in Spanish conversation groups and attempting to talk to people in my gym who are native Spanish speakers.  

I never really got 'fluent' in German, but was fairly conversationally proficient...but generally had to think about the words before saying and/or understanding them. 

I'm REALLY struggling with Spanish, though.  I'm having a hard time remembering words, even after reviewing them just 1-2 minutes earlier.  Also, I am mixing up Spanish words with German words quite a bit. 

Example - the word/term for 'weekend' (fin de semana)...I've had that in multiple lessons both in Coffee Break Spanish AND Rocket Spanish...I've read it...I've written it several times...I've tried to memorize it...I've spoken it dozens of times...but it doesn't stick.  The German word for weekend is right there at the top of my brain whenever I need it despite the fact that I've not spoken German in years...but not the Spanish one.  

Anyway, I'm probably not making much sense, but I guess my question is...is 54 too old to try to become proficient in another language?  I really want this move to work, and also it's always been my life goal to be 'fluent' (or close to) in another language.  I think this is my last chance.

1n6ogid,https://www.reddit.com/r/AbioticFactor/comments/1n6ogid/armor_sets_tied_list/,Armor sets tied list,"I'm going to write down my personal tier list of the armor sets in this game.
I have more than 300 hours spread across multiple worlds in this game and I play it since the hydroplant update, so I consider myself experienced.

I'm going to consider the following aspects in the ranking:
-Armor stats: the defense of the armor as well as it's weight, considering the sector it's found on as well as the stats of their upgrades on the sector the upgrade is available 
-set bonus: the bonus for 2 pieces and mainly 4 pieces
-How it fits at a certain play style

Let's get into it then

+Makeshift armor (A) this is the only armor that can be upgradeable 4 times, making it viable across all sector, it's last upgrade is on residence, making it a viable pos game armor, its set bonus, although not particularly good or gaming changing, it's solid and kinda nice to have when looting, but the best about this armor is it's very light, giving a good defense/weight relation

+Maestro armor (S-) completely weightless and can be upgraded twice, the second time on reactor, making it also solid, it's stat bonus is absolutely game changing, half the stamina can make throwing and strong attack play style way better, and we all know how broken sprint attack is, it can give infinite stamina if you use an incursion suit

+F.O.R.G.E armor (B+) good defense overall, mainly for early game, and has a set bonus that can give you value very often, as bullets are the main threat you will be facing

+Carapace armor (C-) ok stats, besides being better late game than forge stat wise, it's set bonus is very situational, as peccary and pests (main melee attackers) stop being a threat after lab and become a nuisance at most

+Security armor (B) it's not upgradeable so it's stats stay bad, it's set bonus it's pretty broken, but not always good, you cannot attack while blocking, so you will either have to take a few hit by lowing the shield and attacking every now and then or have allies attack, but blocking strong attacks or lot of attacks can send you flying behind your allies, so enemies cannot kill and you cannot kill them, also, exors ignore shields 

+Hex armor (D) not upgradeable, light weight, and ok set bonus, not much to say about this one, it's just kind meh at everything, not bad but not particularly good either

+Crystal armor (S) ok stats, but that doesn't matter, it main strength is its ability to turn stealth from completely dog shit into absolutely broken, with this armor enemies can't see you even if you get literally on their face, with a carbon pickaxe and level 15 stealth you can clean an entire sector without being seen

+Cascade armor (B+) great stats, is upgradeable besides being from hydroplant and pretty light, it's set bonus is also good, not game changing but good

+Montaineer (D) not upgradeable and, even though it has insane defense for hydroplant, it's also very heavy, the makeshift armor on residence has more defense than it and is practically weightless, set bonus also doesn't help that much

Snow armor (F-----) absolutely useless, and a huge waste of resources, it gives you way more cold resistance than you need and removes all of your defense, there are various other ways to get cold resistance, such as makeshift chestplace a lot of helmet found anywhere such as karate helmet, coffee, heater shield. Not only that, but having no cold defense won't kill you either, it will be just very annoying, you can also get the mountaineer armor for the cold resistance. 

+ Exor armor set (S+) good defense for both reactor and residence, best set bonus in the game, independent from your game style, using a core keeper trinket makes the spirit even stronger than a regular exor cha, and those are already super strong, can almost defeat a robot by itself, all of that while tanking all hits, oh it's also light and give you bionic legs effect, like it needs it

+ Reactor armor (A-) great defense but also pretty heavy, its set bonus is very hard to maintain, for starters, the armor does not give you full radiation resistance, so I'd you don't use neutrino lantern you will die if radiation if you carry around a lot of leyak essence, but you also needs to be highly irradiated to receive the health Regen, and the amount you need for maximum Regen is almost 40, in which causes you to vomit, worst of all, having the radioactive itens on protected slots will give you no speed as it doesn't count as producing radiation

+ Legate armor (E-) bad defense for residence, heavy and almost useless effect, 5% is pretty much nothing

+Triarii armor set (F) bad defense and useless set bonus

+Exulum armor set (D+) it has nice defense, it's set bonus is, strange, it makes you very tanky and immovable, but also unable to run, the 25% damage reduction is good for taking for the team but it does not make you invincible the not being able to run, besides being very bad, is not that bad considering being immune to knock back allow you to approach your enemies, you can also unequip the armor when not in combat

+Saggitari armor set (C-) I really like this one, it's main gimmick is being good with scoped weapons, because of that, having low defense can be ignored by hitting enemies from a mile away, but it has two problems, first, there are just very few open areas in this game you can actually fight enemies from a distance, and second, there are only three scoped weapons, on of them being very late game and having a pricey ammo

+Exsurgo armor set (E+) pretty... Ok it reduces chance of bleeding for anybody nearby which is a nice passive bonus, but it kinda defeat the purpose of medic, it defense is horrible so it's only viable early maybeeeeee mid game

+Mystagogue armor set (B) 20 defense at residence should be a crime, set bonus pretty solid though, immune to fall damage is not game changing but pretty nice to have, the eyes can also do good damage but they don't tank like the exor armor",4,1756831082.0,AbioticFactor,4,0.7,False

Not because they were purposefully removed by some nefarious outside force.,"Third places only truly work if people go to them. Most of the third places in my neighborhood weren't established organizations or places, they were public spaces. A little plaza that had some benches and used to have like 20+ people hanging out there. The basketball court. The park stairs. The picnic tables in the corner park near the diner.

All these places used to be areas where locals congregated and just hung out. Sometimes teens, sometimes 20-40 year old's, sometimes old people drinking coffee. They just faded away. The places themselves are still there, but you do not see large social groups hanging out there anymore. Not for any reason specific to the area, but because people started spending vastly more time indoors instead of spending most of their free time outside. There used to be jack shit to do inside. I mean sure, there were video games and there was the internet, but it wasn't anywhere near as engaging or addictive as what we have today (to most people, at least). You got bored quickly, and so there was more desire to find stuff to do outside, even if it just meant chilling and chatting with people for hours on end. Today? We can spend an entire week inside and never truly be bored. 

Third places didn't just magically go away from 2012-2018. [Yet the amount of time teens spend socializing dropped by HALF in those 6 years.](https://i.imgur.com/DOvQUf6.png)

1n6odi3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1n6odi3/is_the_mr_coffee_brew_now_or_later_12cup_coffee/,Is the Mr. Coffee Brew Now or Later 12-Cup Coffee Maker Worth It? Review,"The Mr. Coffee 2176667, also known as the Mr. Coffee 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker, has been part of my daily caffeine ritual for a while now. This coffeemaker promises to deliver convenience and simplicity with features like the programmable ""Brew Now or Later"" option, the Grab-a-Cup Auto Pause, and an easy-to-use design. Let me take you through my experience with this sleek, black coffee machine.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Its compact and modern design fits nicely on my kitchen counter without feeling bulky. Measuring 8.9” in depth, 13.1” wide, and 13.8” tall, it’s perfectly proportioned for most kitchen spaces while still brewing up to 12 cups of coffee. The black exterior, paired with simple button controls, gives it a professional and timeless look. While the plastic build feels a bit light in some places, the overall design is functional and easy to clean, with the Lift and Clean Filter Basket simplifying maintenance.

**Ease of Use**  
Operating the machine feels intuitive thanks to its fully automatic operation mode and programmable LED display. I often use the Brew Later feature, which allows me to set up the coffee machine the night before. There’s something magical about waking up to the smell of fresh coffee brewing. Additionally, the water window on the side eliminates guesswork—it’s easy to avoid overflows while filling the reservoir.

[Check Mr. Coffee 2176667 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b089dwfp9l/)  

**Features and Performance**  
What stands out is how practical the Grab-a-Cup Auto Pause feature is. For someone like me who can’t wait for an entire pot to finish brewing, this lets me grab a quick cup mid-cycle without spilling a drop. The drip coffee system works well with ground coffee, maintaining a robust flavor for each brew. On the downside, this isn’t the fastest brewer on the market, but for 12 cups, the brew time feels reasonable, averaging about 10 minutes.

**Highlights**  
- **Convenient Programming Options**: The Brew Now or Later function makes mornings easier.  
- **Mid-Brew Pouring**: The Grab-a-Cup Auto Pause is a lifesaver for the impatient coffee lover.  
- **Quick Cleaning**: The Lift and Clean Filter Basket keeps maintenance low-effort.  

**Bad Points**  
- **Material Quality**: Some parts feel a bit flimsy, especially the lid and filter basket.  
- **Brewing Speed**: While the coffee tastes excellent, it takes slightly longer than higher-end models.  
- **Noisy Operation**: The brewing process produces a bit of kitchen noise, which can be distracting.  

**Who it’s Perfect For**  
This coffeemaker is ideal for anyone seeking simplicity without sacrificing functionality. Whether you’re a single coffee drinker or serving a family of coffee lovers, the 12-cup capacity adapts to various demands. It’s particularly suited for those who wake up ready to grab their coffee without manual intervention, thanks to its programmable settings.

**Alternative Offerings**  
Comparing this to the Cuisinart DCC-3200, another 12-cup coffeemaker at a similar price point, the Cuisinart offers a sturdier build and additional features like brew strength control. However, it's slightly more complex to operate. On the other hand, more affordable options like the Black+Decker DLX1050B lack programmable settings but might still suffice for someone who only needs the bare essentials in coffee brewing. The Mr. Coffee machine strikes the middle ground with its convenient features and approachable design.

**Value for Money**  
Relative to its competitors, this product offers a decent balance of quality and affordability. It doesn't come with the bells and whistles of higher-end models, but for those prioritizing ease of use and straightforward functionality, it holds its own. Sure, there might be premium coffee makers with fancier finishes, but the Mr. Coffee 2176667 is solid for its intended purpose. It’s a reliable drip coffee machine that offers consistent performance, and that’s something I appreciate daily.

I spent a couple of hours:

* sanding it smooth
* giving it a fresh coat of stain
* replacing the handles with some extras I already had

Posted it on Facebook Marketplace for **$90** just to see what would happen. By Sunday afternoon, someone messaged me and picked it up for **$80 cash**.

Nothing crazy, but it was quick and made me want to keep an eye out for more small flips like this.

1n6ocpt,https://i.redd.it/5j62hhm34smf1.jpeg,How do I make this thing make espresso taste nice!?,"So first off not using espresso beans. The picopresso is brand new and usually make coffee with the aeropress hence not yet buying specific beans. 

I have improved greatly since my trial yesterday which was just plain nasty. Hand grinding to where it is firm to pump, makes a bit of a squeak (incase that means anything).

Using 17g of beans (they are newground kilimbi if anyone happens to know what roast that is coz they don't tell you). Gentle tamp 🤷‍♀️ like drop it in and it just sits nicely on the lip of the funnel bit, take the funnel off and just drop the tamp in without pressure for good measure. Preheat and pump all the water through whilst rapidly running back to the kettle to flip it on again.

Pump 11/12 times til that first drip beads & then wait 30 seconds (digging through some posts here seemed 30 seconds was the consensus). Then pump like my life depends upon it.

I would say still slightly sour but much improved upon since yesterday (I followed the instructions to the letter then and wanted to scrape my tongue). I have also tried this method I've come up with using a different coffee  though it was a slightly coarser mokka grind (had given up with the hand grinder at that point so went back to my aeropress stuff) so I don't think I can blame the coffee unless they are both just a bad roast level for the picopresso.

Also if you have a specific bean recommendation we commonly buy from rave, origin, newground, & a local roastery called rising grounds

Rent, utilities, internet, furniture, random Target or grocery runs, it honestly feels like a second class on top of my actual courses. Back home I watched relatives get buried by credit card debt, so I’ve always been cautious. Now I’m trying to keep track of coffees, snacks between lectures, textbooks, groceries, and bills I didn’t plan for. Living alone adds up quickly, but it’s the trade-off for peace and focus.

The good thing is I’ve been keeping a close budget and already have solid credit, which makes life a lot easier. Still, I don’t want to start digging a hole before the semester is over. A couple of people mentioned debit cards that report to credit bureaus, so you only spend what you actually have but still build credit. That seems perfect while I figure out how to manage everything here.

Anyone here using one of those? Did it actually help your score? Any fees or limits I should know? Also, any local tips would be amazing: ways to keep utilities down, best spots for affordable groceries around Westwood, textbook hacks, or budgeting tricks that actually stick.

However, friends of mine who were applying to college last year have a very different view. Most have told me they see it as a wannabe UChicago or Ivy League, relentlessly spamming emails, calling itself ""One of the Nation's Best"". They see its efforts to try and game the rankings of US News and World Report as insecure, and evidence of the school's lack of prestige. What I believe CWRU should do is lean into the nature of Cleveland itself: gritty, built on steel, and powerful. If the Ivy League schools are whipped cream high end coffee shop milk shakes with sprinkles and sugar and crap, Case is a cup of black coffee. Obviously, I wouldn't wish for them to define themselves by the Ivy's, but I like the idea of going to a black coffee school. A working class institution with faculty and students who want to cut past the BS of most higher education and get to the stuff that actually matters. I don't know, maybe this is me feeling sorry for myself that I'm not at a school with ""ultimate prestige"", but I do think that this would overall be good for Case's image.",7,1756830733.0,cwru,3,0.82,False

After reading all your successful flipping stories, I finally decided to give it a shot myself. A few weeks ago, I bought a used coffee table for $25 on Facebook Marketplace. It just needed a good clean and some polish.
After spending about 30 minutes cleaning it up and taking better photos, I posted it back on Marketplace for $80. I got a few lowball offers, but eventually sold it for $75 in cash within 4 days.
While it wasn't a huge profit, turning $25 into $75 with minimal effort felt fantastic. It gave me the confidence to continue looking for more items to flip. I'm already eyeing some used electronics and furniture nearby 👀

Where do I go from here?,"My \[24F\] boyfriend \[25m\] and I have been together for 4 years now. He is nothing but the best in every sense and gets along really well with my family, my friends and everyone recognizes he is an amazing partner. Recently, we had a trip coming up so I was using his phone to look up flight details in our messages. When I looked up my name, I saw messages with one of his best friends \[25m\], let's call him A where the two of them were talking shit about me and A's girlfriend. For context, A's girlfriend is verbally abusive towards him and believes that men should pay for everything despite making 3x A's salary.

These messages range from A and my bf complaining about how I and A's girlfriend never pay for anything despite wanting to go out all the time and spend money on ""$10 coffees"", and talking about how many times we have used our cards a particular day. In our relationship, we always take turns paying with my bf covering bigger expenses as I am still in school while he's working but I always assumed we had no problem with our finances. Another example was recently my bf and I had an argument which my bf vented to A about which I understand is completely normal but A proceeds to tell my bf that I am emotionally immature and would have no problem finding a new girlfriend. Another instance is A's gf is terrible at keeping friends and my bf chimes in by saying if it wasn't for my high school friends, all of the other people in my life are his friends. This hurts the most because we always take pride in having a shared circle of friends who love the both of us equally. Around the same time, I was really sad about not getting into grad school and my bf vents to A about how much it was annoying him that I was so sad. All of these are really hurtful because my bf is nothing but supportive to me and holds me to a really high regard. And all of these messages only started once A started dating his gf and began venting about her.

However, I feel like under the guise of being a good friend and making A feel better about his shitty relationship, my bf would make me come off as a bad gf too. I am not sure if this is a naive interpretation of this. I spoke to my bf regarding this and he hasn't stopped crying since and feels really bad that I had to read all that and states he was just joking to make his friend feel better. I understand with the guys paying for thing could pass as banter. However, I feel some of the comments from him were unwarranted and worse than what A was saying about his gf. I am really upset with him of course and told him that he has no loyalty towards me and that because someone else has a bad girlfriend, doesn't mean I am a bad girlfriend as well. Especially when my name is being dragged into a conversation where A's girlfriend is verbally abusive toward him, I can't even fathom calling my partner names. I am not sure where to go from here, I really thought I would marry my bf and I love him so dearly, there is no one else out there for me. But I am not sure how to properly move on from this situation and what the right kind of conversations look like so there is steps to improving us.

TL;DR: Found texts between my boyfriend and his best friend where my boyfriend is speaking poorly of me. He insists he was joking to make his friend feel better, but I feel betrayed and hurt. Not sure how to rebuild trust or move forward.",0,1756830517.0,relationships,3,0.5,False

1n6o64p,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewedForYou/comments/1n6o64p/explore_if_rella_laundry_detergent_sheets_really/,Explore if Rella Laundry Detergent Sheets Really Clean Clothes,"Rella's laundry detergent sheets are an interesting twist on traditional bulky detergent bottles I’ve used for years. Having spent a good chunk of the past month testing these out on everything from my workout clothes to my kids' pasta-splattered shirts, I feel like I’ve truly put them through their paces. Their compact form drew me in initially, but there’s more than meets the eye with this product.

**Compact Packaging for a Minimalist Laundry Setup**  
The very first thing that caught my attention with these detergent sheets is how ridiculously compact they are. They take up virtually no space in the laundry room, which means I’ve finally reclaimed some shelf space for things other than unwieldy plastic jugs. The family-owned Rella brand seems to have designed these sheets with minimalism and environmental friendliness in mind. As someone actively trying to reduce my plastic use, I absolutely loved the biodegradable and plastic-free packaging. 

**Ease of Use: Toss and Go**  
Using these detergent sheets is as simple as it gets. I don’t miss the days of heavy guesses on how much detergent my mountain of laundry required. All you need to do is grab a sheet and toss it in the machine. The premeasured clean is convenient, especially during those mornings when I’m functioning on a mere cup of coffee and can’t think straight. This simplicity makes it a win for busy parents, college students, or anyone who prefers to keep things fuss-free.

[Check Rella B0D3FG3FBH price on Amazon.](https://reviews.sanue.com/p/b0d3fg3fbh/)

**Powerful Cleaning, Even on Tough Stains**  
During my testing, these sheets managed to lift stubborn stains far better than I expected. Coffee spills, mud stains from my kids’ escapades, and even grease from a Saturday BBQ were tackled effectively. They dissolve instantly in both cold and hot water, which is a major bonus. Given their performance, I’d say they rival many traditional liquid detergents on the market. Plus, they’re free from PFAS and harsh chemicals, so I feel a bit more at ease tossing my infant’s clothes into the wash with these.

**Fresh Linen Scent: Subtle but Effective**  
The scent is another highlight here. It’s got this fresh linen aroma that strikes the perfect balance—not overpowering but just enough to keep your clothes smelling clean and pleasant. My biggest pet peeve with some detergents is that they leave a cloying smell that often competes with any perfume or deodorant I wear, but with these sheets? That’s never an issue.

**Eco-Friendly Perks**  
For anyone trying to live a little greener, these detergent sheets scream eco-consciousness. They eliminate the need for bulky plastic bottles, reducing waste significantly. I also love how lightweight and compact they are for travel. This came in super handy on a weekend trip where I was able to slip them into the tiniest corner of my suitcase. Lugging around a big bottle of liquid detergent in that scenario? Yeah, no thanks.

**Merits of Rella Laundry Detergent Sheets**  
- Compact and lightweight, perfect for small spaces and travel.  
- Powerful stain-fighting capability.  
- Dissolves quickly and works in both hot and cold water.  
- Subtle fresh linen scent suitable for all.  

**Hurdles to Consider**  
- These sheets may not be the best option for extremely large loads. You might need to use two sheets, which could reduce overall cost efficiency.  
- The fresh linen scent, while mild, might not appeal to fragrance-free enthusiasts.  
- Sheets can sometimes stick together in humid climates, though they separate easily once dry.

**Competitive Alternatives**  
In comparison, brands like Tru Earth and Earth Breeze offer similar eco-friendly detergent sheets. While Tru Earth’s sheets are slightly larger and boast a fragrance-free option, they come at a slightly steeper price point. Earth Breeze, on the other hand, is comparable when it comes to travel-friendly designs, but I found that Rella’s sheets excel in their ability to dissolve instantly even in cold water. These detergent sheets may not have the brand power of some conventional jug detergents, yet they feel just as effective in cleaning capabilities, if not better, when considering sustainability.

**Financial Value**  
The practicality and eco-friendly nature of the product make it a smart pick for those interested in cutting down plastic waste and simplifying their laundry routine. While the upfront price might seem higher than bulk liquid detergents, the premeasured nature ensures it lasts a decent amount of time, as there’s no risk of overusing like with liquids or powders. For the convenience and environmental factors combined, it’s truly worth every penny.

The original text and the full translation can be read [here](https://sharetext.io/1831542e).

# Nightwish’s Tarja: “I miss peace and silence”

Nightwish’s long tour ends at Hartwall Arena October 21st to the joy of Finnish fans. A new collection album *Highest Hopes - The Best Of Nightwish* comes out in September. We called Tarja and asked how life is treating the girl from Kitee.

Tarja answers the phone with a sunny North-Karelian dialect and Mix’s questions from her home in Kuusankoski.  
Sipping my morning coffee here and waking up the day’s duties. Incredible weather here, it’s fantastic!

**The band’s show in Provinssirock at least had a great feeling. How was it like to play for a Finnish audience after a long time?**  
It was an amazing show, it’s so wonderful to play for a Finnish audience. We noticed that we were SO welcomed!

**How are your own projects doing, you’re releasing solo material on Christmas again right?**  
I made a single last Christmas and of course we’re coming up with one this year. I’m starting a two-week tour in the beginning of December, I’m touring for my future Christmas album. The repertoire will be mostly classical and traditional Christmas music in many different languages, because the concerts will be in many countries. Two in Finland also. The Christmas album will come out in 2006.

**You’ve been to Germany studying classical lied singing (German songs from the 19th century). How hard is it to keep heavy metal and classical music separate?**  
Chamber music has been close to my heart already years before Nightwish. Nightwish came into my life kind of by accident, it was never a little girl’s dream, to be a metalhead and go out to do shows. Of course it has been enjoyable work, it’s amazing that this has been at all possible and that this kind of popularity happened to a group from Kitee.  
I’ve made it clear from the start that I want to hold onto classical music besides the heavy music. Fans all over world understand, that if I sometimes go solo, it probably won’t be heavy metal. When I’ve done concerts in Europe and South-America, many Nightwish fans come to listen and they’ve genuinely liked it. It’s positive that young people go to churches they wouldn’t visit otherwise and even though it’s different kind of music, the voice is mine.

**Is the idea that celebrities and artists have such a deep impact on young people ever frightening?**  
It is of course dangerous in of itself, when you’re still missing your own identity. The media also has its own power. But many also understand that we’re only doing our job and are just regular people. That I go to the john like everybody else (laughter). It’s really sad to sometimes see those people, who tour everywhere with us. They’re putting it all in. Just financially it’s an extreme thing, if you travel where ever Nightwish travels.

**In an interview you did with a woman’s magazine it read somewhat conflictingly that you have an image, that you’re friendly…**  
To be friendly constantly. My image is kind and I’m a very happy person. People just avoid getting close to me, firstly because I’m a woman and men shun away from that a little and secondly because of the position they see me in today. But I’m the one, who mostly makes an effort to come close and say hello and shake hands. There are of course moments when we’ve been travelling for three-four weeks and somebody comes to disturb me just when I’d like to be left alone. That’s a situation in which you have to press the sociality button down. You have to find that positivity from within, if it doesn’t come naturally.

**Do you tour on the bus with the guys or do you travel to venues separately?**  
I tour separately because I can’t really sit in a bus because of my voice. Even though the bus is wonderfully equipped, it has everything you could need and I have my own room and a double bed and everything. I do travel shorter distances with it. For longer trips my body handles flying better, although that’s really not good for your voice either. I always travel with my husband, who takes care of my security and all other things.

**Have the boys given you a hard time, that the bus isn’t good enough anymore?**  
They have it so much nicer when I’m not there parenting, that how much are we partying in here (laughter)… no, but really. They can have their own parties and they’ve never complained, on the contrary. They say “just go already!” (laughter). It’s fun to come back the next day and listen to what has happened again…

**Do you have advice for younger people who dream of a classical singing career?**  
It’s a good dream to have, but you also really have to work for it. You can’t just stay resting on your laurels. A singing teacher can help you. You don’t want to start doing and trying things you don’t know about. I’ve done this for many years and still go to lessons and probably will for the rest of my life. You have to do this sensibly. It’s a long road, one step forward and three steps back.

**Have you every thought about a teaching career?**  
I’m teaching all the time in Buenos Aires. People have asked a lot in Finland too, but we come over here for a day or two at a time and it would be nice to be able to just be at home and rest. Teaching is a nice counterbalance to all this.

**Finland vs. Buenos Aires?**  
Well.. Finland wins 6-0! (laughter). Really all I can say is that there’s no beating this. Finland and wonderful friends, nature, peace and beauty. Especially the peace and quietness. Right now, I’m looking at my garden through the window, it’s superb. We came here first to mow the grass and to enjoy. I said to my husband that there’s nothing better in life than this, having your fingers in dirt and marveling.

It’s like life is on repeat.
You’re busy, but somehow not moving forward.
I’ve been there—days blending into each other, no progress, just… existing.

👉 Here’s what helped me break that cycle:

Micro goals, not big ones. Instead of “I’ll change my life this month,” I just aimed to finish one small meaningful task daily. Example: reading 5 pages, writing 3 lines of a thought, or calling that one person I kept postponing.

Writing down the noise in my head. Sounds silly, but dumping my racing thoughts on paper made me calmer and more focused.

Celebrating tiny wins. Seriously, checking off “drink water before coffee” gave me momentum.


It wasn’t magic, but slowly days started to feel different—not perfect, but alive.

So if you’re feeling stuck, start stupidly small. Progress isn’t always a big leap; sometimes it’s stacking little bricks until you realize you’ve built a wall.",1,1756830067.0,DecidingToBeBetter,1,1.0,False

1n6nxav,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniversalEpicUniverse/comments/1n6nxav/a_no_express_passhelios_great_day/,A No Express Pass/Helios Great Day!,"Feel like I had a pretty great experience with this no plan plan Labor Day Weekend and no express pass so wanted to let anyone know before their own stay. Long post. But before I went I read a lotta of stuff that inspired this so figured I’d share how we had a great time! Never felt like I was dying in an extreme line! 

-Stayed at Helios* two nights. had dinner and drinks at the bar upstairs the first night. Slept in till 7:30 no alarm, showered, changed and park ready. 
-8am Had a quick sit down breakfast at the Flora restaurant downstair. Wanted a full breakfast for energy and hydration before. 
8:55 ish we walk to security with a line of about three others ahead of us and are in the park at 9:01am no running crowds or anyone really around us either. This morning ease felt so worth it. Felt like we breezed right in. I Didn’t expect that speed and didn’t even have a plan till the moment! But decided to head over to…

-Super Nintendo world* walked around a little when it felt pretty empty still got into Mario Cart line for a minute then saw Mine Cart DK* was the same wait and changed our minds and went straight there. It said 35 but was literally 10-15 maybe. It wasn’t hot and didn’t even feel much like a wait. Loved it even though was nervous with everyone’s warnings, super fun start to get that outdoor wait over with before the big heat. Walked around SNW a little longer (should’ve spent a few more minutes here to really enjoy, one regret) but planned on returning later. so next headed over to…

-Isle of Birk.* 9:35am Filled my water right at the stand outside of it then waited 5/8 minutes maybe and portal was opened before 10am. 
Walked straight to Hiccups Wing Gliders* cause that was the other I really wanted to get on. I was also a little nervous about. (The rides I was most excited for I was also most nervous for??) Wanted to get that HOT line outta the way. It was just long enough, probably waited 20/25 cause there was a slight pause right before we got on with some empty test carts being sent out. Have a fan for that line, I was feelin meh for a little probably cause of minecart before, the heat and my anxiety hot flashes combo, but my ice water and fan saved the day. But I said to myself if this was a longer wait or any hotter it would’ve been hard. That ride was a THRILL and so so fun. Bought the picture and headed to…

-Harry Potter Portal*, now I wanted to relax after all that motion and sun so we explored some HP shops and got a sherbet lemon cocktail from bar moonshine and went to the Goblet noir for a nice AC lunch. NO ONE was in there when we got there. Ordered food and beers enjoyed by ourselves with every seat to our choosing feelin very immersed. Then the floodgates open and seats fill up with families in ponchos or drenched in their clothes… realizing it’s raining we get another drink and relax not feeling rushed watching the radar. 

-When it was dying down we ponchoed up and headed to Helios hotel* for a coffee and little bathroom break and outta the rain. 

-Headed back to the park for Dark Universe* while it was still raining slightly and a lot of rides were down. Got on Monsters Unchained* with the 2nd longest wait of the day funny enough at 30 minutes but was comfortable and entertained. And Fun ride not as thrilling I’d saw but real awesome animatronics, I was entertained and smiling the whole time. 
-saw an awesome violinist “street” performer after and got some more drinks and a garlic stake bread stick at the Burning Blade Tavern* best drink there was “My only weakness” refreshing gin drink,  woulda had those all day. Hung out there and in that area. 
- grab another cocktail at Bar Zenith* I believe it’s called on the way to HP portal

-feelin loose and fed it’s time for shows, which personally was my must do / most excited for. 
3pm HP portal, Grab another Sherbert Lemon from Bar Moonshine*. Then ran into the start of another street performance in front of the steps of a clarinet performer and brass instruments with a creature which was amazing!!! And not expected! Before stepping in line for the 
- HP Circus Show* 4pm ish We wait in the queue for the 3rd longest wait of the day, enjoying our drinks and get a great seat near the front. FANTASTIC show!!!
-after the show we walk to Isle of Berk to try and catch that line queue for the next Untrainable Dragon show, missed it so explored more Dragon world, (check out the ice Dragon) before waiting in line for the next time (this is where I was too busy enjoying myself to go back to SNW!!) but maybe that’s why I made it into the last show of the day for 
-Untrainable Dragon* at 7pm, AMAZING MUST SEE.!!!! 

-Had a reservation at Atlantic so went there but could’ve done without.. based on timing. (Could’ve done SNW then too) It was a bday trip so just wanted to try it. Thought it’d be faster. Though The Corn Soup was amazing and exactly what my stomach needed at that time. Headed straight back to HP Portal around 8:30pm

- 8:39 in the HP Portal, beauty at night. Straight to Ministry of Magic* line!!! The app said 65 minute wait I believe and we were one of the last like 50 allowed to get into the queue! So seeing the queue super empty like that was even cooler cause there’s no crowds filling out that giant room. We’re on the ride around 9:45pm and after I just wanted to see one more portal at night so booked it back to…

-Dark Universe at 10 on the dot… everyone’s being escorted out but the sweet attendant let us walk through when it felt like no one was in there for a few minutes! (It was just two of us and I had a bday pin lol) which was super cool and nice. 

-We walked right out of DU and got a seat for the fountain show which is a perfect finale for the day!! Got a great ice cream from the hotel lobby market (Lavender honey) and went to the room, Ordered room service (it’s busy at night there was an hour wait) late night pizza and bed!! 

Really thought I was gonna need the express passes to handle the heat but it worked! For myself personally, 5 minutes of feeling crappy during hiccups wait and a little iffy before dinner just cause I needed food is real success for theme park summer for me. Even if I didn’t do everything I wanted it’s not humanly possible to absorb all that great stuff in. You could focus on a portal a day if ya wanted to get real detailed. One day maybe we will!  Next trip SNW will be a focus! 

- But 4 rides, 3 being the most popular to get on and 2 beautiful shows, many drinks and shops and a sit down lunch and table service dinner with beating the rain and heat sounds like success!! Helios is worth it if not having to park and prep is important to you. Being able to get back to the room so fast and even knowing it’s a possibility eases so much anxiety. Feels like you’re living in the park really. Also shoutout to all the nice Epic employees makin my crap birthday year feel so much better truly!! I was stressing before this. Never encountered a rude person either, attendees too! So sweet

Here's how it goes:

I was at a cafe this afternoon trying to enjoy my coffee fix. Out of nowhere, a kid came up to me and said ""Let me play on your phone"". Of course, I said ""no"" because who in their right mind would give their phone to someone they don't know.

His mom, who was sitting just a table away, came over and said ""He is just a kid. Can you give him your phone for a few minutes?""

To be honest, I was shocked. I never thought she'd say that. I just replied, ""How about you be a parent and bring something for him to do?""

She glared at me and went back to their table while dragging the kid with her. It somehow felt like she was talking shit about me, but I was too busy on my phone to hear her.

I know this sounds crazy and I was surprised as well. Never thought such a thing could happen lol.

This lifting coffee table was made from cherry and furniture grade birch plywood. I had access to a CNC machine and cut most of the parts using it, but post processed everything by hand. Assembly was mostly a breeze, I used a few screws that should be hidden. Finished with sanding and two-ish clear shellac coats. Relatively happy with the final product, though I can see all the little mistakes, they don’t bother me too too much.",104,1756829818.0,woodworking,11,0.98,False

Artist statement:

*“You must understand: we are at war” - TV commercial for Kobalt 40-volt outdoor power tools* 

*“Our enemy will feel the bite of our iron. Kill them!” - TV commercial for Scotts EcoSense Weed-Be-Gone*

A grass lawn is useless. The roots of lawn grasses are too shallow to prevent soil erosion, and the plants themselves provide nothing to pollinators. They require tremendous amounts of water to keep alive. Perhaps most perversely, they are useless by design: the origins of the grass lawn can be traced to displays of wealth by the British aristocracy, where they communicated “look at me! I’m so rich I can literally waste land.” 

This uselessness must be preserved at all costs. If a dandelion (early food for pollinators, edible to humans, deep taproot that helps remediate soil) infiltrates, you have failed to maintain order in your kingdom. It must be destroyed with maximum prejudice, lest neighboring fiefdoms perceive weakness (or you receive a passive-aggressive letter from the HOA). Keep all growth in check. There is no room for divergent assessments of value. If you need a reminder of your mission objectives, study your neighbor’s lawn. Yours should look identical, yet somehow slightly greener. Remember the words of General Kobalt, “We are at war!”",268,1756829736.0,Artisticallyill,20,0.99,False
