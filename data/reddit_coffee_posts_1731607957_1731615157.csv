1grdn7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1grdn7r/aita_for_siding_with_a_friend_who_called_my_other/,AITA for siding with a friend who called my other friends stupid? (Long ahh post so apologies in advance).,"I’ll try to keep this straight. I (21M) have one friend we will call “Romeo” (19M) who is a genius. The parts of his genius we care about here is he is really good at detecting liars and EXTREMELY good at collecting data and putting puzzle pieces together. Now, on the other side is the friend group, of which we care about “AJ” (24M) and “Brad” (23M). The reason we care about these 2 is because they are directly involved. 

So, a new game just came out called “Death Note: Killer Within”. If you’ve played “Among Us”, it has a similar theme. Team Kira has to eliminate L or complete their tasks, and Team Investigators has to arrest Kira or complete their tasks. Since Romeo is an amazing detective, I figured he would be a great person to bring into the game group for this game. I bought the game for him (he prefers fantasy so was hesitant) and showed him the basics in some public lobbies, until he got the basic jist.

So the friend group (10 people) and us all get on and start to play. A few rounds in, Romeo gets selected to be “L”. L’s job is the lead investigator, who leads meetings, assigns tasks, and tries to stop Kira. He can’t tell anyone he is L though because if L dies, Kira automatically wins. The way Kira writes names in the death note is by stealing IDs, so Romeo has to avoid everyone.

This game was a real challenge. We were on I think Day 2 Romeo successfully arrested Kira’s Follower using a confirmed investigators voice (L can’t be to obvious during meetings, so he was guiding the confirmed investigator to arrest the follower). 

On Day 7, Kira used a command card to force an emergency the investigators have to fix. Romeo didnt go to avoid getting his ID stolen. What AJ and Brad didn’t know, is Kira stole AJs ID just before time expired when the event ended. The day ended, and the progress report starts (basically an emergency meeting where you vote to arrest people).

AJ: Romeo, why weren’t you at Sakura TV? [Location]

Romeo: I didn’t want my ID to get stolen.

AJ: Funny you mention it because MY ID is stolen, and I know Brad didn’t take it, so that leaves you or Kira (I don’t have a fake name for Kira because he isn’t important). 

Romeo: Kira, where were you during the event, and is your ID gone?

Kira: My ID isn’t gone, and I was at classroom.

AJ: It’s got to be Romeo, he’s been avoiding people all game and acting weird. I got a hunch he is playing 4D chess. (He then casts a vote for Romeo)

Romeo: I am not Kira-

Brad: nah, you been acting mad weird Romeo. Not coming to the event so you could kill investigator (the guy who died. Brad then casts his vote for Romeo. At the same time, Kira casts his vote for Romeo without saying anything).

Romeo: you idiots and your hunch just cost us the game. Think about it for a second more. Why would someone be avoiding a Kira event where people stack on top of each other to fix it?

AJ: not to get their ID stolen.

Romeo: and yet yours was. So, tell me, if I wasn’t at the event, and you were with Brad when investigator died, then who stole the ID?

Brad: it wasn’t me.

Romeo: that’s because it was Kira. He lied about being in classroom, and I know he lied because I was down there, and he wasn’t there. I checked classroom, restaurant, coffee, and the storage and no one was there. He stole your ID during the event, which you shouldn’t have even gone to, and purposely didn’t write your name hoping you and your friend would turn on me. I know this because I’m L. 

Kira: minor correction L, I stole his ID before the event, but I used the event to try and find you because him going to the event confirmed he wasn’t L. I thought if I killed him, you and Brad would turn on me, so that part is right. Good game L.

Romeo: and there it is. I hope you learn to not rely on hunches in real life, because it’s going to cost someone their life one day, you fucking idiot. Good game Kira, you are a tough one to read.

The meeting ended, L was arrested, and as the round started, Kira wrote L’s name down and L died. Kira won the match. AJ, Brad, and Romeo started BLOWING UP each other because AJ said “you know, I was suspecting Kira a little too”.

In response, Romeo said “no you weren’t. You are coping with being wrong and trying to act like you knew something you didn’t. Pseudo intellectuals like you are the dumbest people. I only pity Brad, who is a loyal dog.”

They just get screaming and yelling at each other before Romeo left. When Romeo left, Kira and I sided with Romeo, saying that it was in fact AJ’s “hunch” that lost them the game. He made a baseless accusation with no real proof and Brad bought it. AJ cussed me out, and left, then Brad followed. AJ hasn’t talked to me since, but Brad said I was a shitty friend for taking Romeo’s side when he “isn’t apart of the main group”. AITA? I’m sorry for the long post and ik not everyone will get it, so I’ll explain in comments best I can to questions. ",2,1731614170.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

Hey everyone,

I’m a freshman at a target school (not Ivy League, but still top 20), and I’ve been doing a lot of outreach to recent grads now working at places like McKinsey, JPMorgan, etc. I’ve managed to get some calls with them, which is great, but I’m struggling a bit with the small talk and overall flow of the conversations. Hoping someone here can offer some guidance.

Here’s where I’m stuck:

1.	Opening Small Talk: After I say, “Hi, how’s your day been?” they respond, but there’s often a bit of an awkward pause afterward. I’m not sure how to fill that moment before diving into my questions. Any suggestions for making the conversation feel more natural?

2.	Conversation Tone: I’ve noticed that most of my calls have a very formal tone. I try to keep things friendly, but it seems like we’re just sticking to business. Is that normal, or is there a way I can make the calls feel a bit warmer and more engaging?

3.     Running Out of Questions: Today, I had a call scheduled for 20 minutes, but I ran out of questions around the 13-minute mark because the person gave quick, to-the-point answers. I felt bad ending early and like I should’ve been better prepared to keep the conversation going. Any advice on handling short answers or extending the conversation when they don’t elaborate much?


4.Closing the Call: I usually end with, “Thank you for all the advice!” and ask if it’s okay to reach out again in the future. But I’m wondering if there’s a better way to wrap things up that feels more thoughtful.

5.Behavioral in General: I didn’t grow up in a middle-class neighborhood, and I haven’t had much exposure to the kind of “polished” business environment that’s often expected. I could really use some advice on how to carry myself in these settings—how to speak, act, and present myself in a way that fits the culture. Any tips on adjusting my approach for behavioral interviews would be super helpful.

I bought an espresso machine (not a super cheap one, but also not a great one, it was Lelit Anna) and a proper grinder, and I really fought with it for a few months, but really couldn't get consistent results that I wanted. I remember watching YouTube videos of how to fix my espresso and trying lots of things and I still couldn't do it consistently. I ended up selling everything due to the frustration and feeling like an idiot.

Last week I decided I've had enough of takeaway coffee and I want to try at home again, but with an Aeropress this time. Bought a grinder, aeropress and a milk foamer and some coffee, and... it just works and actually makes good coffee every time? I am not kidding, all I needed to do on the first day was adjust the grind size a bit and on the 3rd or 4th coffee I was like ""damn, this is it!"". The brewing process is so simple and enjoyable, and I feel like it's much more forgiving than a machine.

1grdgxo,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1grdgxo/i_just_ended_a_friendship_of_25_years/,I just ended a friendship of 25 years.,"I had this best friend growing up and we were inseparable from basically the moment we met. Went to the same school, had matching outfits, same summer camps. We were so close it was easier to just tell people that we were cousins. At some points her mom was struggling to care for her so my parents took her in and helped raised her. 

We never had a conflict up until high school. Out of nowhere she blocked me and shut me out of her life. When I say it hurt worse than a break up- it did. Because I had zero closure and she refused to speak with me so that I could find out what I did. She began to hang out with popular kids, and I deduced that she felt the need to ‘ditch me’. 

After high school she came crawling back and apologizing to the point of tears- telling me she majorly fucked up and missed our friendship and what she did was shallow, immature, she was just desperate to be accepted. I was never uncool by any means, but she wanted to hang out with rich scene kids that did drugs at school and uh, I wasn’t on that level. 

Our friendship slowly became repaired and all returned to normal. She slept over at my house most of the week, we worked the same job, and even attended most of the same college courses. I became her tutor and we were always hanging out and having fun. 

But then she got a boyfriend, and she started to pull the same thing. She never wanted me to meet him, or his huge group of friends. She was constantly at his college parties, traveling with his friends. They ended up getting a house together and she transferred jobs and school. I was never once invited to their house either. 8 years. They were together 8 years and I never met him once. She was suddenly now always busy. 

We only hung-out when she was in town to see her mom, or had time to kill before an appointment. It always felt like a quick coffee date where we talked on a superficial level about careers and traveling. Anytime I tried to make the conversation deeper or bring up an inside joke it got awkward. If I spoke about an issue in my life she would say ‘anyways let’s talk about something more positive! I’m going to Cancun next month.’ I started to feel like… she didn’t care about me. But we kept it at this pace of connecting every few months or so.

A couple years ago I moved across the country, and I haven’t seen her since. We haven’t talked a whole lot aside from interacting with social media posts via a reaction. I had a couple of unread messages from her and just figured she was really busy. She would always apologize and say she was really busy, but that time and distance would never break our strong connection. 

She posted on social media that she was excited for her wedding next week. Wedding? And with a different guy than her bf? I was shocked. It had never been mentioned to me. And more importantly, I was never invited.

I reached out to congratulate her, ask for details etc. I asked her where my invite was, and she said money was tight and they had to have a very small intimate wedding. Figured I was probably on the family level even if we hadn’t talk a lot. But okay I get it.

The wedding was not small. Or cheap. When the photos were posted I saw so many brief people from our past that my heart felt crunched. It was a luxurious wedding of about 200 people (her husband is very wealthy it turns out). Ffs she invited her damn LANDLORD. 

I sat with it for a month. I wanted to give her time to relax, her honey moon. I was also debating on saying anything. Honestly? After everything this told me all that I needed to know.

I sent her a last message, wishing her well- but also addressing the past and current actions and behaviors she’s had towards me. How she had found me embarrassing, how she kept me away from other peers. How I was never included, how she had changed and it felt like she no longer valued or connection. How the things she’s said and done have hurt me and how it upsets me that after all we’ve been through it’s like I was nothing. I told her I didn’t want to continue this friendship because I couldn’t lie to myself anymore.

She hit me with ‘I’m sorry you feel that way. Feel free to reach out if you change your mind. Otherwise I fully respect your decision.’ That was it. No explanation, no real apology. She wants it this way. But she can’t be bothered to say that out loud.

I blocked her and I have felt peace. I no longer feel tension in her presence like she is secretly judging me. ",5,1731613718.0,offmychest,2,1.0,False

1grdbrf,https://i.redd.it/84sqsjxh7x0e1.jpeg,Weird Encounter with a Federal Agent (or Was It?),"I had the weirdest experience today and wanted to see if anyone else has had something similar—or can help me make sense of it.

I walked into a cafe to grab a coffee and settle in, but as I was about to sit down, I noticed this guy in a suit—looked like a federal agent—pointing his phone camera right at me. I stared at him, and he quickly put it away. Weird, right?

As I try to shake it off and settle into my seat, I catch him doing it again. This time he’s trying to hide behind a pillar, but it’s pretty obvious he’s aiming at me. Again, I stare him down, trying to figure out if I’m really the subject of his attention. When it happens a third time, I’ve had enough.

I loudly call him out, disturbing everyone in the cafe. He scrambles to explain, saying he was trying to take a photo of an “off-duty Santa Claus.” Now, there was a guy in the cafe with a white beard and a red hat, but no full Santa costume just a regular guy enjoying his coffee and bagel. It made zero sense.

At this point, I snap a photo of the guy as he comes around the corner, and he approaches me again, insisting he just wanted a picture of “Santa.” Like… what? Why would a federal agent or anyone, really want a sneaky photo of a random bearded guy in a cafe?

Here’s where it gets even weirder: about 15 minutes later, as I’m leaving the cafe, I notice three other guys in similar suits trailing me down the street.

So… what gives? Does anyone have any idea what might’ve been going on? Was this some kind of training exercise? A coincidence? Or am I just overthinking a super strange interaction?

Let me know if you’ve seen or experienced something similar. This one’s gonna bug me for a while.",0,1731613340.0,sandiego,17,0.43,False

I don't know what is happening, I guess I need help.

I have :  
Rocket Apartamento (upgraded for commercial pressure stat) Eureka Libra, VST 18g, 0.25mm needle wdt, calibrated 58.5 tamper. Machine and shower head regularly cleaned. Naked portafilter.  
Fresh beans 7-10days, ratio 1:2 18g/36ml, as a starting point, also that's what my local specialty coffee shop uses for that specific 'Have Fun' Canadian roast and they are true experts. Medium-light beans.

The problem is:  
Shots tastes like nothing, watery, shorter or longer shots didn't fix it. Longer ratio didn't help.  
I am very dedicated to learn how to dial espresso, I put a lot of care on my puck prep, always carefully tamp, never hit the porta filter to create cracks. The grounds are flat before tamping. I never rake the bottom when I wdt. I always flush/cooling process before extractions.

I just discovered that you can lower the pressure (stock was 13bar, like many Rockets) lowered it to 8 bar, the puck is now a little less wet, but still tastes like nothing, and still channel mid extraction. (I have a pressure gauge on the e61 head)

It ALWAYS swirl/channel during mid-extraction. The flow suddenly start dancing after 15-20sec. 8bar or 13bar is the same.

It used to be that the first drip is around 13-14 sec. (still 18g/36ml for 30sec go figure) Now after going a bit coarser, it starts dropping at 8-9sec, but same channeling occurs, and STILL that same 18g 36ml in 30sec! wtf  
According to guides, if I go finer, it will create more stress/prone to channeling, and it will drip at like 13-15 sec, which feel very weird, and will channel. I read that a lot recommends that the drip start at around 7 sec. Is that very important ?

Spent hundreds of hours online :(  
Also, does temperature have such a huge impact on extraction? Do I absolutely need a thermometer on the e61head ands lush accordingly? Even If I ALWAYS flush?  
I just want good espresso, not keep spending money on gadgets.

1grd3pp,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/1grd3pp/on_the_importance_of_being_normal/,On the Importance of Being Normal ,"I’ve (SD, 47DWM) had a lot of different kinds of experiences with different types of arrangements over the years and many have been very good. A lot of get to know you coffees and drinks, dinner dates, PPM’s, long term allowances, trips, gifts, etc. the whole gamut.

One of the things almost every POT SB I’ve met has shared is the overwhelming number of utterly insane messages they get from men on SA or other sites.

Men who are embarrassingly boastful about money, hyper aggressive about sexual prowess, peacocking about their comparisons with other men, and an overall lack of charm. 

I strongly suggest that men will do better if they work hard to just be “normal.” From what I can see, “normal” guys can get dates with the best woman are far likelier to get 2nd and 3rd dates.

The approach that I follow is:

1. Treat POT SBs as you would any other dating site or even more importantly like you would a woman you met at a bar or cocktail party. 
2. Share who you are, what you’re looking for, ask questions, listen to their answers.
3. Move fairly quickly to brief in-person coffee/lunch/drink or if not local, hold a FaceTime/skype.

This will demonstrate you aren’t a time waster, that you’re willing to reassure eachother of identity and appearance, and most importantly weed out scammers and time wasting SBs.

4. Recognize that your most important hurdles to clear with a POT SB are SAFETY, KINDNESS and RELIABILITY. Those are the boxes that need to be met far more than sexual prowess and net worth. 

5. Be interesting and interested. Try to be somewhat aware of popular music, movies, books and humor including on TikTok. You don’t need to be weirdly interested but at least showing that you’re aware and can be conversational is important.

6. Addition, not subtraction: Don’t be the guy who shits on recent culture and talks only about how the great everything was in 1970s, 80s and 90s. Most SBs will be open to learning about your interests particularly if you’ve shown an interest in theirs. One of the best things about dating SBs is the chance to broaden your interests.

7. Don’t dwell on ex-wives or past SBs. 

8. No politics early. Save that for months 4 or 5 or never.

9. Don’t lead with kink or fantasies until trust and connection have been established. You’ll get there, just give it a week .

10. Be patient. IRL you wouldn’t assume sex on a first date so don’t hear either. You’ll have better sex and more of it if you can just focus on connection first.

11. Most of the women I’ve met aren’t only in the bowl for money but also because they’re exhausted of the men their age. If you act as much the ass as a 26 year old guy, what’s the point. They want you to be patient, safe, poised, intelligent and authentic.

1grd3n4,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1grd3n4/beanroom_taipei_taiwan/,"(beanroom) Taipei, Taiwan","I recently went on a trip to Taipei and Tokyo. I tried many coffee experiences. Including Glitch and Koffee Mameya. The coffee was excellent at all of the establishments but the experience and coffee at beanroom was better overall and the last cup of coffee I had there really floored me and was the best cup of the trip. It was a strawberry co-fermented Colombian coffee. It was sweet, tart and had strong strawberry notes like nothing I ever had before in the best way (no other info since it was a non production experimental coffee).

They also had a unique approach to serving iced pour coffee, they used an double walled glass cup with an ice agent to avoid diluting the coffee with ice. Glitch used ice, I thought that was pretty smart. I think they cooled it before putting into that glass. They did everything in the back of the house so unsure of the preparation but they did provide recipe for each of their coffees.

The experience is much more intimate and they start the tasting 1 hr before opening so it is quiet and you can reflect on the coffee. The store is beautifully designed and features a custom copper bar with clean minimalistic lines. The staff really cares about the quality of their beans and roasts although I am not sure how good their English is. They feature small lots from both Taiwan and the rest of the world their roasts range from light to medium and is Asian pour over focused.  It was a sharp contrast to the hustle and bustle of the normal cafes in Japan. Maybe it is more a more intimate version of Koffee Mameya Kakeru since they only have 5-6 seats. I was unable to make it to that location maybe next time.

I am not affiliated with them and actually just stumbled upon this place since it was right next to my accommodations. I think they have a unique way to approach coffee that focuses on quality, environment, service and experience. Maybe this will help someone try something new if they are in the area. For me this was a very unique coffee experience.

It’s seems like you both had some hope when you separated earlier this year that you guys could figure it out (Timestamp: 1:35)
- Jax: When we separated, we decided to take some time apart. But there were some things that happened during the separation that I just can’t come back from. There’s relations that she had with friends of mine 

Let’s get into that. It came out recently Lala on her podcast talked about the fact that Brittany was dating your friend Julian. How did you discover that Brittany was dating Julian and why was that so out of bounds for you? (Timestamp: 2:08)
- Jax: Yeah, I saw it on her phone. We were sitting in my house, and her phone was on the coffee table, and a message popped up, and I looked at it, and it was a simple message from Julian, but it was at night, and it was just a very weird message, and I caught her on it, and I caught her in a couple of lies, and then I got it out of her. An hour into the conversation, she finally broke and told me, and I was just, that's where it started.
- Jax: I was just in shock. Now, mind you, when we separated, we agreed, we said, hey, listen, we can see other people, because we thought maybe we needed to go our separate ways and see other people to see if we were right for each other. But one of the rules was no friends or nobody we know.
- Jax: I don't think I would have been bothered by it if it was somebody else I didn't know, but the fact that it was one of my friends that I brought into my group, that I've taken care of, that I've helped get a manager, that I've helped build relationships with, I've helped, I just did a lot for this guy. I just felt like it was such a slap in the face to me a little bit.

Was also, was part of it that you didn't know so finding out about it that way? (Timestamp: 3:27)
- Jax: Yeah, because she was keeping it a secret, and through that whole, there was a whole five, six months where I wasn't seeing anybody, but this was going on. And we were going back and forth. She was sometimes staying at the house.
- Jax: We were going out to dinner. We were kind of, yes, we were separated, but we were still hanging out with each other. Meanwhile, she was dating this guy. And, you know, I don't have the best track record. I've done my fair share of things. 
- Jax: Maybe it's karma, but man, I definitely got a taste of my own medicine for sure. Obviously, we know what happened with the Faith situation. So it just didn't feel good. It didn't feel good.
- Jax: No matter, it just put a really bad taste in my mouth. And that's kind of where the downward spiral started for me. Because I don't know if obviously everybody knows, or maybe they don't, but that's kind of the last eight months of my life have been hell. I've been just kind of, I went off the deep end. I really did.

And you were saying that it sort of, it began with that. And what was it about that? Was it then knowing effectively that your marriage was over? (timestamp: 4:25)
- Jax: She came and stayed at the house. I was leaving for an appearance. I had to go, no, I'm sorry. It was 4th of July. I was leaving for a week for 4th of July. I was going to Michigan to see my sister and she was going to Kentucky.
- Jax: And we had, I'll be honest, we had relations before I left, literally right before I left. And things were looking good, things were looking great. I come back home and I said, hey, what do you think about moving back?
- Jax: And she said, yeah. And then she was upstairs cleaning and I just saw the iPad and she was still talking to Julian and sending him pictures, like naked pictures and pictures of my son. And I was just like, I lost it.
- Jax: And that's where, that was my bottom, that was where I hit the bottom of the barrel. That's where I just saw red. I kind of had an out of body experience. I'm not gonna lie to you. I went crazy. I threw furniture. Luckily, thank God, thank God my son was upstairs. But that was my breaking point. That was my breaking point. And then two days later, I ended up in an institution.

So tell me about that. Tell me about checking into the facility (timestamp: 5:35)
- Jax: It was probably the hardest thing of my life. It was very scary. How it all happened was my friends came and picked me up. They kind of had an intervention. I was coming home from the gym and my buddies were there and just saying, listen, it's time for you to go. And it was a lot of people, and not to break the fourth wall or anything, but my manager saw me kind of going off a little bit off rails and they said, maybe this is a good move for you.
- Jax: So I honestly have to thank them because I don't think I was bad. It was really, really bad. I don't know where I would be if I didn't go to this institution. I really, really needed to go and I didn't want to go. My ego just couldn't even fit through the door when I got there. I didn't want to be there the first week.
- Jax: It was a struggle for me the first couple of days. I was in an element that I wasn't used to. I was scared. I wasn't sure what kind of people I'm going to walk into. Is there people in straight jackets? Am I going to be in a padded room?
- Jax: Are they going to sedate me? I didn't know what was going to go. I've never done, I've only seen TV shows. So I was just, I have no idea what I'm walking into. And it wasn't that bad. It was a beautiful home.
- Jax: The people there were really, really nice. But it took me about three to four days to really get comfortable. And by the end of like the, I was there for 30 days. And by the end of the second week, I really, really liked it. I loved being there.

It seemed like when you went to the facility, you were getting help. I thought there might be some prospects that you and Brittany would get back together, but obviously, that didn't happen. And the marriage ended. Tell me about that. (Timestamp: 11:52)
- Jax: The first week in, so we were allowed to have our phones. I know it sounds weird, but we were allowed to have our phones at certain times of the day. And the first week, I was asking Brittany, can you please bring Cruz to see me? I was allowed to have visitors.
- Jax: And she said, sure, yes. And then she took it back. And then I kind of went crazy on her the first week. And I started texting and going rage texting and all this. Because I didn't have anybody there. All I wanted to see was my son.
- Jax: And that was my one glimpse of hope, being there. I've never been away from him for more than two days. So now you're putting me in this situation for 30 days, being away from my two year old or three year old, I'm sorry. And it was a lot for me. I'm going to miss this. I'm going to miss moments. So it was tough for me. I mean, I did that in the beginning. And then I caught myself and I didn't do it again.

And then the wedge issue between you guys beyond that, that you weren't actually getting along while you're in the facility is you made plans when you were leaving the facility to move out of the house and to move…(timestamp: 12:55)
- Jax: Actually, halfway through the facility, again, 30 days, about halfway through, my buddy called me and said, hey, listen, there's this new building that just popped up. And Schwartz just moved in. And the two townhouses, beautiful townhouses, we moved anyway.
- Jax: He's like, they're going to go quick. They're beautiful. Why don't you look into it?And so I did it all over the phone. I called my real estate agent, sight unseen. I said, this building, he sent me pictures on Zillow.
- Jax: Schwartz moved in. And I literally moved in a week later. So we literally, Tom and I lived together for many, many years. We both got married for 10 years. Now we're back living together again. We literally have our houses connected.
- Jax: We have our own unit. He lives on one side. I live on the other side. We both have patios that connect. It's, yeah, but the place is beautiful. Like I said, it's a beautiful townhouse and I'm really, really happy there.
- Jax: I thought it was gonna be the right thing. I thought, you know, when I did this, I thought she'd be like, wow, he took some initiative and, you know, he's gonna move out and, you know, let me and Cruz move back in because I thought that's what she wanted. And it was the opposite. She wanted me to really work on the marriage.

Yeah. And I think her contention too was that she, that you knew that she had other commitments as well, that she was paying for the Airbnb. (Timestamp: 14:16)
- Jax: Yeah, but I thought it was month to month. I had no idea that she paid three months out. And also, you know how LA is, like, I had to jump on this, it would be gone. Like, it was too good to be true. It was a brand new building. It was, it's a beautiful place. The price was ridiculously cheap. And I just, I had to take it or would have been gone.

So speaking of Sandoval, you guys are actually on really good terms. You guys are close again, right? (timestamp: 15:30)
- Jax: You know, you really find out who your friends are when you go to something like this and you find out who calls and checks on you. And I got to say, Sandoval and my mom, believe it or not, are the ones that checked in on me the most. And I was like, I didn't see that coming because I really haven't talked to Tom that much during this whole thing.
- Jax: I've kept my distance, but it was really like I didn't even tell him I was going. You know, there's some people that just didn't know. I just went. Obviously, the tabloids picked it up very soon, but I did not expect the calls from Tom, the checking in on me. How are you? How's it going?
- Jax: I know what you're going through. I've been there. You know, I'm dealing with this. How are you? Like, I was just shocked, and I was just like, you know, we kind of picked up where we left off.

Teasing this season a little bit, and this all plays out in full, but you get out of the facility, and then shortly thereafter, very shortly thereafter, you are served divorce papers. (Timestamp: 25:45)
- Jax: I knew that was coming, so what people don't know is the second week in the rehab, I emailed Brittany and said, I am getting a mediator. People don't realize that. I am the one that initiated this.
- Jax: So when I emailed her and I got a mediator, and I emailed Brittany, she was like, oh no, I am getting a divorce lawyer, yada yada, and I was like, okay, whatever. But I was like, why don't we just get a mediator? Why don't we save some money?
- Jax: We are not going after each other financially. There is no reason to spend all this money because lawyers are the only people that win in the long run of these things. Why do all this? And about, yeah, like literally, what, three or four days after I was served papers. Was I shocked? No.
- Jax: But I just want to make it very clear because it looks like she's the one that did this first. I am actually the one who did this second week in the facility. I am the one that emailed mediators. I was the one that got this going. And I think she wanted to be the first one to serve me papers publicly because I haven't talked about that.
- Jax: I think she wanted to be the first to publicly say, I'm divorcing him when in all honesty, I was the one that initiated it. And yeah, when she served me the papers, I think, I'm not sure if production or I'm not sure if Tom, because Tom was there, I'm not sure if they were looking for a bigger reaction from me, but I was just kind of like, okay, yeah, you know, at least this is getting going, this is something that needed to happen. Whether she initiated or I initiated, it doesn't matter to me.
- Jax: It needed to happen. I think, I just think that I blindsided her a little bit. I think she really, really wanted me to work on the marriage. I think that was her goal. And I just was so checked out by that time. I was just really checked out. I just couldn't come back anymore.

Where do you want to be in a few years? If you're three, five years from now, what do things look like for you? (Timestamp: 31:36)
- Jax: You know, we're hoping to open another restaurant very soon in Nashville and one in Florida. The podcast is doing really well. I'm starting another podcast called In the Mind of a Man. I'm hoping to build on that and then hopefully, kind of follow the footsteps of Stasi and go on a tour with it. I'm really, really diving into mental health. I want to talk about it. I want to be open about it. I've been researching bipolar disorder for a while now. I want to help other people with it.

So you can appreciate that there's some skepticism when you talk about changing. Because you've said that before, and then a lot of the same things have happened over and over again. And Brittany doesn't think that you're necessarily capable of changing. What do you say to that? (timestamp: 33:31)
- Jax: That's her opinion. I've never been on medication in my entire life until I went through the facility. So, I think this is playing a huge role. I was very stubborn. I didn't get help. This is the first time I've gotten help.
- Jax: This is the first time I went and had an outreach. Yeah, she's upset. She's upset. She's going to hit below the belt. She's going to say things I'm not going to change. She's going to say this and that because she's hurt.
- Jax: And she has every right to be. You know, as you'll see in the season, you'll see in the season of The Valley, people are probably going to come after me. I was in a really dark, dark place.
- Jax: I did some really awful things. And what I mean by awful things is I was verbally abusive. I was verbally abusive. And, you know, it wasn't necessarily about Brittany herself. I just, I would compartmentalize my problems during the day if something was going on, if something angered me with my family or my friends, or if I just went to the grocery store and somebody pissed me off, I would compartmentalize it. 
- Jax: And then unfortunately, I would go home and my wife was the one that would be, you know, in the line of fire. And I would just take it out on her. I would find something to set me off and take it out on her, which was so wrong. It hurts me that she says that because, you know, I would hope that she'd be like, you know, I will always love him and I want him to change.
- Jax: I would hope she would say that, you know, just for my own thing. I would have been married her for a long time. And I would just hope that after this many years, that she would say that, you know, she would at least say he's a good father. And I hope he changes down the road, not be so negative. I don't understand that.
- Alex: Well, I think that she hopes that you'll change. I think she just isn't convinced that it's going to happen. And I think that's, you know, sort of where time will come into play.
- Jax: Yeah, I think she really wants to see me fail. I really think so. “I think she wants to see me fail. I think she wants to prove everyone right. And to be honest, I've done nothing wrong since I've been out.
- Jax: I've been overly nice to her. I've actually been nice to her more now than I was to when I was married. I go out of my way for her, you know. And there's some, which is weird. She says all these negative things about me, but yet she'll call me like two days ago, come over, you want to have some drinks? Come over, you want to hook up?
- Jax: She'll go out and publicly humiliate me and call me every name of the book. But three days ago, she's like, hey, you want to come over and have dinner? You want to come over and have drinks?
- Jax: Don't tell anybody that I'm doing this. So people don't know that. She talks all this shit, but then, you know, she'll be like, come over, come and hang out, come with this.
- Jax: So I don't mean to blow her cover, but you know, I'm not all that bad. She wouldn't be calling me over. She wouldn't be saying, hey, let's go to the pumpkin patch with Cruz. Let's go to Disney with Cruz. Let's take Cruz together to school. If I was that bad of a human being, do you think she would do all this?

Why do you think that when you say that she doesn't want you to change? Why do you think that? (Timestamp: 36:28)
- Jax: I don't know. I think she just, I think I hurt her bad. I think over the years, I've really worn on her. And I think I just, I put such a bad taste in her mouth. And I think the fact that I've decided not to work on the marriage, I think that was a huge blow to her because she thought I, I think she thought I was going to work on the marriage. And I think she was kind of a little bit shocked by that.

What is it like co-parenting when you guys are not getting along personally? (Timestamp: 37:54)
- Jax: You know, it's been fine up until now. And I know not to break into the divorce, but people were coming at after me because I didn't get a lawyer in the beginning. And it's not that I didn't want to get a lawyer.
- Jax: I was just trying to give Brittany what she wanted. And she told me right off the bat, yes, these are the things I want full custody and all this. She's like, but you're going to see Cruz every day.
- Jax: I'm just saying this because I'm protecting myself. You know, I'm his mother, but she's like, you know, you're a great father. You're going to see him all the time.
- Jax: So I figured, okay, I'm not going to fight her on this. There's no reason to fight. I don't, you know, and I thought, okay, I get them on the weekends and every Wednesday. I thought that was a pretty fair deal. I think people just thought I was giving up. That's not the case at all.
- Jax: I would never in a million years do that. And we had a one-on-one talk about it. She's like, you know, I would never do that. I just protecting myself and that, you know, I have the final say. The only thing I have a problem with, and there's all this is what we've talked about is medical. I want to be involved in the medical and I want to be involved in his schooling.
- Jax: So other than that, you know, that's his mother. I want him to be in the house that he grew up in. And right now we're kind of, you know, going back and forth because we both have busy schedules with different things. So, you know, right now it's hey, can you take him tomorrow? Can you do this tomorrow? It's just been back and forth, which I knew it was going to be.
- Jax: I knew it was going to be like that. She's not going to want to hire a nanny every day. That's expensive, especially when I'm right down the road and I'm by myself and I'm constantly calling her every day.
- Jax: What do you need me to do tomorrow? What do you need me to kind of grab it tomorrow? Let me take him for a couple hours to give you a break because he's a lot.

Has your mother met Cruz at this point? (Timestamp: 43:06)
- Jax: No, and I haven't really spoken to my mother. I think she got wind of, I think, like everybody else, through the tabloids. She reached out to me while I was in the facility. She checked in on me every day. I've tried to reach out to her a couple times. She's very vague with me.
- Jax: I sent her pictures of Cruz. I do want her to meet him, I think, at some point. I just, I would regret it down the line if my son says, hey, why don't you try to work it out with your mom, or how come I could have never met her? I think I would, I think I would, you know, never forgive myself. And, you know, it's hard to hold grudges. It's hard to be angry. I mean, it's a lot easier to forgive.
- Alex: Let go.
- Jax: Let go, because we're not here for a long time, you know? And yeah, I don't agree with what she did, but life goes on and I feel like I don't need to be in the best relationship with my mother, but I would like to have a sit down with her. And we did talk about it the last week in my facility of meeting and she agreed to it. So I'm gonna go to Florida and meet her one on one and then eventually bring my son over.

So we touched a little bit earlier on the fact that you and Brittany also are going into business together or extending the business that you have together. So let's talk a little bit more about Brittany's bar and what it will be like for you guys to work together if you're still trying to figure out how to co-exist. (Timestamp: 44:19)
- Jax: My partners came up to me literally probably four weeks ago and said, Hey Jax, what do you think of us opening a bar called Brits? And I go, really? I mean, this is all during the thing of it. And I was like, they're like, listen, we understand what's going on with you. We know there's a divorce. If you say no, well, we won't do it.
- Jax: Why don't you sleep on it and let me know? And from a financial standpoint view, I thought, why not? But there's going to be some strengths. I'm going to be an investor. I'm going to be the quote unquote silent partner. And I'm going to have, I'm going to let her design it.
- Jax: She can have her say, but I will be having a stake in it. I will be the, you know, it's under my business title. It's under Jax Taylor Inc. So she will have that as much as it is hers. I will still have a percentage of it.
- Alex: What could possibly go wrong?
- Jax: Like I said, I'm going to give it to her. I'm going to be more the silent guy. I'm not really going to say anything. She can run it how she wants. I'm just going to take a cut. That's part of the deal. Just like anything else in life.

And what happened when you presented this to her? What was her reaction? (Timestamp: 45:44)
- Jax: She was really excited. She was really happy. And, you know, it was one of the weeks where we were getting along. And, you know, when we get in the arguments, unless I go, you know, Brittany, I've been so amazing to you since I've gotten out of this. I've accepted, I'm letting you have a bar with this, with my business partners. Like you're getting a golden opportunity here, kind of the same golden opportunity that I had.
- Jax: You don't have to put a dime into it. They're going to front all the money. Your name is going to be on it. You're just going to collect a check. You're not going to get this anywhere else. You're going to have to put your own money.
- Jax: I mean, look at Tom and all those other, but they have to put their own money in. You're not going to do that. And I made this happen for you. I go, cut me a little slack here. And then it just goes back to me being an awful selfish person that she calls me all the time. If I was this person, why would I be like, oh, this is a good idea.
- Jax: Let's do this. Why would I extend myself? I feel like, you know, she just, I don't know. It bothers me.

In the mean time, I notice certain spaces are much more damaging.

Spending time on instagram or tiktok I find I’m exposed to a lot more low quality slop, arguing, culture wars, models and influencers etc, so I prefer to waste time on reddit, but also get tired of the political spam and echo chambers, whatnot and running out of interesting things to read, the low attention span endless scroll of 5 second content.

Any other good ways I can kill some time in the bathroom or at the train station? I’m sick of being radicalized during my morning coffee.

1grcwm6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheValleyTVShow/comments/1grcwm6/bravos_hot_mic_episode_from_november_14th_jax/,"Bravo’s Hot Mic: Episode from November 14th, “Jax Taylor Talks Brittany Cartwright Divorce, The Valley New Season, and More”","So I recently spoke to Brittany about this situation and both have been going through it. It’s seems like you both had some hope when you separated earlier this year that you guys could figure it out (Timestamp: 1:35)
- Jax: When we separated, we decided to take some time apart. But there were some things that happened during the separation that I just can’t come back from. There’s relations that she had with friends of mine 

Let’s get into that. It came out recently Lala on her podcast talked about the fact that Brittany was dating your friend Julian. How did you discover that Brittany was dating Julian and why was that so out of bounds for you? (Timestamp: 2:08)
- Jax: Yeah, I saw it on her phone. We were sitting in my house, and her phone was on the coffee table, and a message popped up, and I looked at it, and it was a simple message from Julian, but it was at night, and it was just a very weird message, and I caught her on it, and I caught her in a couple of lies, and then I got it out of her. An hour into the conversation, she finally broke and told me, and I was just, that's where it started.
- Jax: I was just in shock. Now, mind you, when we separated, we agreed, we said, hey, listen, we can see other people, because we thought maybe we needed to go our separate ways and see other people to see if we were right for each other. But one of the rules was no friends or nobody we know.
- Jax: I don't think I would have been bothered by it if it was somebody else I didn't know, but the fact that it was one of my friends that I brought into my group, that I've taken care of, that I've helped get a manager, that I've helped build relationships with, I've helped, I just did a lot for this guy. I just felt like it was such a slap in the face to me a little bit.

Was also, was part of it that you didn't know so finding out about it that way? (Timestamp: 3:27)
- Jax: Yeah, because she was keeping it a secret, and through that whole, there was a whole five, six months where I wasn't seeing anybody, but this was going on. And we were going back and forth. She was sometimes staying at the house.
- Jax: We were going out to dinner. We were kind of, yes, we were separated, but we were still hanging out with each other. Meanwhile, she was dating this guy. And, you know, I don't have the best track record. I've done my fair share of things. 
- Jax: Maybe it's karma, but man, I definitely got a taste of my own medicine for sure. Obviously, we know what happened with the Faith situation. So it just didn't feel good. It didn't feel good.
- Jax: No matter, it just put a really bad taste in my mouth. And that's kind of where the downward spiral started for me. Because I don't know if obviously everybody knows, or maybe they don't, but that's kind of the last eight months of my life have been hell. I've been just kind of, I went off the deep end. I really did.

And you were saying that it sort of, it began with that. And what was it about that? Was it then knowing effectively that your marriage was over? (timestamp: 4:25)
- Jax: She came and stayed at the house. I was leaving for an appearance. I had to go, no, I'm sorry. It was 4th of July. I was leaving for a week for 4th of July. I was going to Michigan to see my sister and she was going to Kentucky.
- Jax: And we had, I'll be honest, we had relations before I left, literally right before I left. And things were looking good, things were looking great. I come back home and I said, hey, what do you think about moving back?
- Jax: And she said, yeah. And then she was upstairs cleaning and I just saw the iPad and she was still talking to Julian and sending him pictures, like naked pictures and pictures of my son. And I was just like, I lost it.
- Jax: And that's where, that was my bottom, that was where I hit the bottom of the barrel. That's where I just saw red. I kind of had an out of body experience. I'm not gonna lie to you. I went crazy. I threw furniture. Luckily, thank God, thank God my son was upstairs. But that was my breaking point. That was my breaking point. And then two days later, I ended up in an institution.

So tell me about that. Tell me about checking into the facility (timestamp: 5:35)
- Jax: It was probably the hardest thing of my life. It was very scary. How it all happened was my friends came and picked me up. They kind of had an intervention. I was coming home from the gym and my buddies were there and just saying, listen, it's time for you to go. And it was a lot of people, and not to break the fourth wall or anything, but my manager saw me kind of going off a little bit off rails and they said, maybe this is a good move for you.
- Jax: So I honestly have to thank them because I don't think I was bad. It was really, really bad. I don't know where I would be if I didn't go to this institution. I really, really needed to go and I didn't want to go. My ego just couldn't even fit through the door when I got there. I didn't want to be there the first week.
- Jax: It was a struggle for me the first couple of days. I was in an element that I wasn't used to. I was scared. I wasn't sure what kind of people I'm going to walk into. Is there people in straight jackets? Am I going to be in a padded room?
- Jax: Are they going to sedate me? I didn't know what was going to go. I've never done, I've only seen TV shows. So I was just, I have no idea what I'm walking into. And it wasn't that bad. It was a beautiful home.
- Jax: The people there were really, really nice. But it took me about three to four days to really get comfortable. And by the end of like the, I was there for 30 days. And by the end of the second week, I really, really liked it. I loved being there.

It seemed like when you went to the facility, you were getting help. I thought there might be some prospects that you and Brittany would get back together, but obviously, that didn't happen. And the marriage ended. Tell me about that. (Timestamp: 11:52)
- Jax: The first week in, so we were allowed to have our phones. I know it sounds weird, but we were allowed to have our phones at certain times of the day. And the first week, I was asking Brittany, can you please bring Cruz to see me? I was allowed to have visitors.
- Jax: And she said, sure, yes. And then she took it back. And then I kind of went crazy on her the first week. And I started texting and going rage texting and all this. Because I didn't have anybody there. All I wanted to see was my son.
- Jax: And that was my one glimpse of hope, being there. I've never been away from him for more than two days. So now you're putting me in this situation for 30 days, being away from my two year old or three year old, I'm sorry. And it was a lot for me. I'm going to miss this. I'm going to miss moments. So it was tough for me. I mean, I did that in the beginning. And then I caught myself and I didn't do it again.

And then the wedge issue between you guys beyond that, that you weren't actually getting along while you're in the facility is you made plans when you were leaving the facility to move out of the house and to move…(timestamp: 12:55)
- Jax: Actually, halfway through the facility, again, 30 days, about halfway through, my buddy called me and said, hey, listen, there's this new building that just popped up. And Schwartz just moved in. And the two townhouses, beautiful townhouses, we moved anyway.
- Jax: He's like, they're going to go quick. They're beautiful. Why don't you look into it?And so I did it all over the phone. I called my real estate agent, sight unseen. I said, this building, he sent me pictures on Zillow.
- Jax: Schwartz moved in. And I literally moved in a week later. So we literally, Tom and I lived together for many, many years. We both got married for 10 years. Now we're back living together again. We literally have our houses connected.
- Jax: We have our own unit. He lives on one side. I live on the other side. We both have patios that connect. It's, yeah, but the place is beautiful. Like I said, it's a beautiful townhouse and I'm really, really happy there.
- Jax: I thought it was gonna be the right thing. I thought, you know, when I did this, I thought she'd be like, wow, he took some initiative and, you know, he's gonna move out and, you know, let me and Cruz move back in because I thought that's what she wanted. And it was the opposite. She wanted me to really work on the marriage.

Yeah. And I think her contention too was that she, that you knew that she had other commitments as well, that she was paying for the Airbnb. (Timestamp: 14:16)
- Jax: Yeah, but I thought it was month to month. I had no idea that she paid three months out. And also, you know how LA is, like, I had to jump on this, it would be gone. Like, it was too good to be true. It was a brand new building. It was, it's a beautiful place. The price was ridiculously cheap. And I just, I had to take it or would have been gone.

So speaking of Sandoval, you guys are actually on really good terms. You guys are close again, right? (timestamp: 15:30)
- Jax: You know, you really find out who your friends are when you go to something like this and you find out who calls and checks on you. And I got to say, Sandoval and my mom, believe it or not, are the ones that checked in on me the most. And I was like, I didn't see that coming because I really haven't talked to Tom that much during this whole thing.
- Jax: I've kept my distance, but it was really like I didn't even tell him I was going. You know, there's some people that just didn't know. I just went. Obviously, the tabloids picked it up very soon, but I did not expect the calls from Tom, the checking in on me. How are you? How's it going?
- Jax: I know what you're going through. I've been there. You know, I'm dealing with this. How are you? Like, I was just shocked, and I was just like, you know, we kind of picked up where we left off.

Teasing this season a little bit, and this all plays out in full, but you get out of the facility, and then shortly thereafter, very shortly thereafter, you are served divorce papers. (Timestamp: 25:45)
- Jax: I knew that was coming, so what people don't know is the second week in the rehab, I emailed Brittany and said, I am getting a mediator. People don't realize that. I am the one that initiated this.
- Jax: So when I emailed her and I got a mediator, and I emailed Brittany, she was like, oh no, I am getting a divorce lawyer, yada yada, and I was like, okay, whatever. But I was like, why don't we just get a mediator? Why don't we save some money?
- Jax: We are not going after each other financially. There is no reason to spend all this money because lawyers are the only people that win in the long run of these things. Why do all this? And about, yeah, like literally, what, three or four days after I was served papers. Was I shocked? No.
- Jax: But I just want to make it very clear because it looks like she's the one that did this first. I am actually the one who did this second week in the facility. I am the one that emailed mediators. I was the one that got this going. And I think she wanted to be the first one to serve me papers publicly because I haven't talked about that.
- Jax: I think she wanted to be the first to publicly say, I'm divorcing him when in all honesty, I was the one that initiated it. And yeah, when she served me the papers, I think, I'm not sure if production or I'm not sure if Tom, because Tom was there, I'm not sure if they were looking for a bigger reaction from me, but I was just kind of like, okay, yeah, you know, at least this is getting going, this is something that needed to happen. Whether she initiated or I initiated, it doesn't matter to me.
- Jax: It needed to happen. I think, I just think that I blindsided her a little bit. I think she really, really wanted me to work on the marriage. I think that was her goal. And I just was so checked out by that time. I was just really checked out. I just couldn't come back anymore.

Where do you want to be in a few years? If you're three, five years from now, what do things look like for you? (Timestamp: 31:36)
- Jax: You know, we're hoping to open another restaurant very soon in Nashville and one in Florida. The podcast is doing really well. I'm starting another podcast called In the Mind of a Man. I'm hoping to build on that and then hopefully, kind of follow the footsteps of Stasi and go on a tour with it. I'm really, really diving into mental health. I want to talk about it. I want to be open about it. I've been researching bipolar disorder for a while now. I want to help other people with it.

So you can appreciate that there's some skepticism when you talk about changing. Because you've said that before, and then a lot of the same things have happened over and over again. And Brittany doesn't think that you're necessarily capable of changing. What do you say to that? (timestamp: 33:31)
- Jax: That's her opinion. I've never been on medication in my entire life until I went through the facility. So, I think this is playing a huge role. I was very stubborn. I didn't get help. This is the first time I've gotten help.
- Jax: This is the first time I went and had an outreach. Yeah, she's upset. She's upset. She's going to hit below the belt. She's going to say things I'm not going to change. She's going to say this and that because she's hurt.
- Jax: And she has every right to be. You know, as you'll see in the season, you'll see in the season of The Valley, people are probably going to come after me. I was in a really dark, dark place.
- Jax: I did some really awful things. And what I mean by awful things is I was verbally abusive. I was verbally abusive. And, you know, it wasn't necessarily about Brittany herself. I just, I would compartmentalize my problems during the day if something was going on, if something angered me with my family or my friends, or if I just went to the grocery store and somebody pissed me off, I would compartmentalize it. 
- Jax: And then unfortunately, I would go home and my wife was the one that would be, you know, in the line of fire. And I would just take it out on her. I would find something to set me off and take it out on her, which was so wrong. It hurts me that she says that because, you know, I would hope that she'd be like, you know, I will always love him and I want him to change.
- Jax: I would hope she would say that, you know, just for my own thing. I would have been married her for a long time. And I would just hope that after this many years, that she would say that, you know, she would at least say he's a good father. And I hope he changes down the road, not be so negative. I don't understand that.
- Alex: Well, I think that she hopes that you'll change. I think she just isn't convinced that it's going to happen. And I think that's, you know, sort of where time will come into play.
- Jax: Yeah, I think she really wants to see me fail. I really think so. “I think she wants to see me fail. I think she wants to prove everyone right. And to be honest, I've done nothing wrong since I've been out.
- Jax: I've been overly nice to her. I've actually been nice to her more now than I was to when I was married. I go out of my way for her, you know. And there's some, which is weird. She says all these negative things about me, but yet she'll call me like two days ago, come over, you want to have some drinks? Come over, you want to hook up?
- Jax: She'll go out and publicly humiliate me and call me every name of the book. But three days ago, she's like, hey, you want to come over and have dinner? You want to come over and have drinks?
- Jax: Don't tell anybody that I'm doing this. So people don't know that. She talks all this shit, but then, you know, she'll be like, come over, come and hang out, come with this.
- Jax: So I don't mean to blow her cover, but you know, I'm not all that bad. She wouldn't be calling me over. She wouldn't be saying, hey, let's go to the pumpkin patch with Cruz. Let's go to Disney with Cruz. Let's take Cruz together to school. If I was that bad of a human being, do you think she would do all this?

Why do you think that when you say that she doesn't want you to change? Why do you think that? (Timestamp: 36:28)
- Jax: I don't know. I think she just, I think I hurt her bad. I think over the years, I've really worn on her. And I think I just, I put such a bad taste in her mouth. And I think the fact that I've decided not to work on the marriage, I think that was a huge blow to her because she thought I, I think she thought I was going to work on the marriage. And I think she was kind of a little bit shocked by that.

What is it like co-parenting when you guys are not getting along personally? (Timestamp: 37:54)
- Jax: You know, it's been fine up until now. And I know not to break into the divorce, but people were coming at after me because I didn't get a lawyer in the beginning. And it's not that I didn't want to get a lawyer.
- Jax: I was just trying to give Brittany what she wanted. And she told me right off the bat, yes, these are the things I want full custody and all this. She's like, but you're going to see Cruz every day.
- Jax: I'm just saying this because I'm protecting myself. You know, I'm his mother, but she's like, you know, you're a great father. You're going to see him all the time.
- Jax: So I figured, okay, I'm not going to fight her on this. There's no reason to fight. I don't, you know, and I thought, okay, I get them on the weekends and every Wednesday. I thought that was a pretty fair deal. I think people just thought I was giving up. That's not the case at all.
- Jax: I would never in a million years do that. And we had a one-on-one talk about it. She's like, you know, I would never do that. I just protecting myself and that, you know, I have the final say. The only thing I have a problem with, and there's all this is what we've talked about is medical. I want to be involved in the medical and I want to be involved in his schooling.
- Jax: So other than that, you know, that's his mother. I want him to be in the house that he grew up in. And right now we're kind of, you know, going back and forth because we both have busy schedules with different things. So, you know, right now it's hey, can you take him tomorrow? Can you do this tomorrow? It's just been back and forth, which I knew it was going to be.
- Jax: I knew it was going to be like that. She's not going to want to hire a nanny every day. That's expensive, especially when I'm right down the road and I'm by myself and I'm constantly calling her every day.
- Jax: What do you need me to do tomorrow? What do you need me to kind of grab it tomorrow? Let me take him for a couple hours to give you a break because he's a lot.

Has your mother met Cruz at this point? (Timestamp: 43:06)
- Jax: No, and I haven't really spoken to my mother. I think she got wind of, I think, like everybody else, through the tabloids. She reached out to me while I was in the facility. She checked in on me every day. I've tried to reach out to her a couple times. She's very vague with me.
- Jax: I sent her pictures of Cruz. I do want her to meet him, I think, at some point. I just, I would regret it down the line if my son says, hey, why don't you try to work it out with your mom, or how come I could have never met her? I think I would, I think I would, you know, never forgive myself. And, you know, it's hard to hold grudges. It's hard to be angry. I mean, it's a lot easier to forgive.
- Alex: Let go.
- Jax: Let go, because we're not here for a long time, you know? And yeah, I don't agree with what she did, but life goes on and I feel like I don't need to be in the best relationship with my mother, but I would like to have a sit down with her. And we did talk about it the last week in my facility of meeting and she agreed to it. So I'm gonna go to Florida and meet her one on one and then eventually bring my son over.

So we touched a little bit earlier on the fact that you and Brittany also are going into business together or extending the business that you have together. So let's talk a little bit more about Brittany's bar and what it will be like for you guys to work together if you're still trying to figure out how to co-exist. (Timestamp: 44:19)
- Jax: My partners came up to me literally probably four weeks ago and said, Hey Jax, what do you think of us opening a bar called Brits? And I go, really? I mean, this is all during the thing of it. And I was like, they're like, listen, we understand what's going on with you. We know there's a divorce. If you say no, well, we won't do it.
- Jax: Why don't you sleep on it and let me know? And from a financial standpoint view, I thought, why not? But there's going to be some strengths. I'm going to be an investor. I'm going to be the quote unquote silent partner. And I'm going to have, I'm going to let her design it.
- Jax: She can have her say, but I will be having a stake in it. I will be the, you know, it's under my business title. It's under Jax Taylor Inc. So she will have that as much as it is hers. I will still have a percentage of it.
- Alex: What could possibly go wrong?
- Jax: Like I said, I'm going to give it to her. I'm going to be more the silent guy. I'm not really going to say anything. She can run it how she wants. I'm just going to take a cut. That's part of the deal. Just like anything else in life.

And what happened when you presented this to her? What was her reaction? (Timestamp: 45:44)
- Jax: She was really excited. She was really happy. And, you know, it was one of the weeks where we were getting along. And, you know, when we get in the arguments, unless I go, you know, Brittany, I've been so amazing to you since I've gotten out of this. I've accepted, I'm letting you have a bar with this, with my business partners. Like you're getting a golden opportunity here, kind of the same golden opportunity that I had.
- Jax: You don't have to put a dime into it. They're going to front all the money. Your name is going to be on it. You're just going to collect a check. You're not going to get this anywhere else. You're going to have to put your own money.
- Jax: I mean, look at Tom and all those other, but they have to put their own money in. You're not going to do that. And I made this happen for you. I go, cut me a little slack here. And then it just goes back to me being an awful selfish person that she calls me all the time. If I was this person, why would I be like, oh, this is a good idea.
- Jax: Let's do this. Why would I extend myself? I feel like, you know, she just, I don't know. It bothers me.

I weigh 460 lbs, I want to lose about 200. I used to weigh more but have lost about 130lbs over the last two years. I have seen some amazing results with this diet but for some reason mine is just not kicking into weight-loss mode. I am quite sedentary, I try walking in my swimming pool but lately, it has been getting colder in the pool so I haven't been consistent with the exercise. I am eating strangely, some days I am super hungry other days I have no appetite at all. 

A basic day for me consists of 5 eggs and 4 bacon strips for my first meal. Then I am eating a ribeye that is around 16 oz for dinner. I will throw in some kiolbasa sausage (no carbs no sugar) sometimes during breakfast or other times at dinner. I do add Kerrygold45-year-old butter for the fat into both meals.  If I get hungry at night I do have Tilamook no sugar beef jerky. I am mainly drinking water and unsweetened black tea ( I need the caffeine and I can't do coffee without sweeteners)

It has helped me in the sense that although I don't have the blood results from before I was constantly urinating prior to starting this diet and now I am back to normal on the urinating. I do have sleep apnea so sleep isn't that great. I started with loose stool the first month but now I am going to poop once every 1-3 days and it seems normal, easy to go once it wants to go.

The 128MB L4 cache eDRAM for the Iris Pro iGPU greatly increased gaming performance in many titles, often surpassing the much higher clocked 4790K. In some games it was enough to even beat the 7700K.

But after that we haven't seen eDRAM on Desktop CPUs anymore and AFAIK only on mobile chips for their iGPUS as intended. The question is: Why? Why did Intel not pursue this further to target specifically the gaming community, similar to what AMD is doing with the X3D chips? We have still seen L4 cache with Iris pro GPUs afterwards, but not on desktop.

Did they simply not feel the need because there was no competition? Did they not want to create competition for themselves as AMD at the time was no threat anyway? But then why are we not seeing such an approach now? Is it not possible with the current architecture to implement this as easily?

Another valid reason might be that they could not produce a chip with eDRAM that was similarly clocked to the higher end i7 CPUs to allow it to consistently beat the latter in gaming instead of being better in many, but worse in some titles?",8,1731612017.0,hardware,12,0.83,False

Adjusting Bias Without the Stress! 🔧,"Hey fellow guitarists! 🎶 So, you want to get that sweet, warm sound from your tube amp? 🥰 Well, it all starts with adjusting the bias! Don’t worry, it sounds scarier than it is, and I'm here to break it down for you. 

### What’s Bias Anyway? 🤔
In the tube amp world, 'bias' is the amount of current flowing through your tubes. Too little? You'll get crossover distortion (which sounds as fun as it looks - NOT!). Too much? You risk thermal runaway - basically, your tubes might wanna throw a fiery tantrum! 🔥

### Why Should You Care? 📈
Properly adjusting your bias means maximizing the lifespan of those precious tubes and ensuring you get that rich, harmonic goodness you're after. Imagine playing like Bowie, but ending up sounding like a cat stuck in a blender! 😹

### Steps to Slay the Bias Adjustment 💪
1. **Prep Your Amp**: Turn it off and unplug it. Safety first, rockstar! 😎
2. **Get the Right Tools**: A bias probe and a multimeter will be your best friends! (And no, not the type you 'probe' on your dates! 💔)
3. **Warm It Up**: Yep, let that beauty heat up before you mess with it - just like me before my morning coffee! ☕
4. **Measure & Adjust**: plug in your bias probe, measure the voltage, and adjust as needed but slowly, like inching into a cold pool!
5. **Test It**: Once adjusted, listen closely. Any distortion? Time to tweak again! 🎧

### A Quick Tip 📝:
Always consult your amp’s manual like a good recipe book! 📚 If things get too hairy, don’t hesitate to call in a pro! Your tubes will thank you, and so will your ears!

Now go out there and get that tone you're dreaming of! Rock on! 🤘🔥

I'm a full-time mailman, but even my salary of but I have some credit card debt I need to pay off.

Anyway, since I usually am heading home by 2 or 3pm each day, and have Thursdays and Sundays off, this seemed like the best second job to get.

So, how was my day? Well, firstly, I took some advice I've seen on here and already purchased a hot bag. I also bought some insulating foam for the bottom, but haven't installed that yet. I'm not exactly in a huge market for food delivery (my area is $, and some surrounding ones are $$), so I decided today would just be about learning to use the app and seeing what areas might work for me, so I accepted a lot of low dollar offers, just to get experience. I've seen advice to not accept anything less than $1.50 or $2.00 per mile, so I'll do that in the future, but today I accepted a couple $1 per mile orders.

So I ended up going live for 90 minutes during lunchtime,and completed 4 orders in that time for $30. I also drove to three distinct geographic areas, and that took some time on the highway, but in the future I'll stick to one. 

The first pickup I had some nerves, didn't know what to expect, but by the third or so, I was actually having fun. I can already tell I don't want to do this in the dark though, just like delivering mail lol

The app was fairly simple to use. My first delivery the Take Photo started automatically, but didn't for any other delivery, so I'm not sure about that.

And I don't like that the coffee button times out. I took some advice I saw to hit that when close to delivery an order so nothing pops up before deliverying, but it timed out fairly quickly, so I just had to deal with it.

Overall, I liked it. I'm excited to fill my off time with something that earns some money, and if anyone has any tips or tricks I didn't mention here, I would love to hear them!

I’ve never taken any daily medication like this before so am just feeling anxious about taking something like this every day. I’ve seen a ton of horror stories across the internet about side effects & withdrawal when stopping the meds so am just coming here for any thoughts or advice! I’m in the middle of a big work transition which is why I sought out help in the first place but am worried of the transition effecting my performance. I’m also going on vacation in about a month so kinda worried about side effects there too, I love coffee & to have some drinks occasionally & will def want to partake on that trip at least. Overall just looking for some support here lol! Thanks in advance :)",1,1731611501.0,qelbree,0,1.0,False

1grckzf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1grckzf/sleep_protocol_help_is_my_phone_ruining_my_life/,Sleep protocol help. Is my phone ruining my life? ,"I am always tired. I quit drinking, i quit alcohol, i experimented with 3 different ADHD meds. Im always tired. Im going to talk to my doctor again about sleep apnea despite my psychiatrist saying I probably dont have it cuz I only have fatigue but no headaches, sore throat, snoring, obesity (im technically 15 pounds overweight by bmi but idk.)

What are the things I should do to ensure Im getting as good a sleep as possible before I throw all my energy into this sleep apnea stuff? 

***Im def guilty of using my phone or laptop (laptop has f.lux) right up until I get in bed. I thought screens were bad for sleep in terms of keeping you awake, but do screens affect the quality of sleep too****? ?*

I unfortunately work in nightlife and tend to get home at midnight and be in bed by 2. I usually wake up between 11 am and noon. But even with all the sleep i never feel rested and excited for the day. 

Im also working with a therapist and a psych. We've considered ADHD, Depression, Anxiety, Chronic Fatigue, Sleep Apnea, Low Testosterone, etc. I've been on wellbutrin for over a year with no side effects, idk if it helps but its not hurting.

My main issue in life is Im frequently tired and want to ""rest"" on the couch. My sick days (order uber eats, stay in bed on tiktok) are not so different than my normal day to day. I have very little motivation to look for more stable, well paying work despite the fact im slowly sinking into debt. And i have little drive to pursue my dreams (acting career) in a tangible way outside of going to classes tho I still procrastinate doing the work and get upset at myself when I dont perform as well as I know I could. I've been lifting weights 3 times a week for over a year but because of my lack of self control with my diet I do not look like I lift which is very depressing. The only thing I look forward to is my relationship and I get anxious that hes gonna eventually see what a loser I am and leave me. I also have had a very low sex drive for a few years and altho this is minor compared to my other issues, its still a sign that something is wrong i think. 

Things I've done to help: 5 months sober from alcohol. 1 month coffee free (occasionally do chai or matcha still). Black out curtains. Ac unit for chilly bedroom. To do lists/achievable goals. Testing testosterone which has gone from 316 to 450 in 3 months. Doctors all say im fine. 

I wish someone could just say lose 20 pounds. or take this pill, or use this breathing machine, or do yoga or quit eating french fries and Id feel good. I dont feel good ever. Sorry for the rant. ",1,1731611451.0,Biohackers,9,0.67,False
1grcj8o,https://i.redd.it/wwo5ywxi1x0e1.jpeg,Help! ,"I have a plant rack at my house, but lately I’ve noticed an influx of gnats around the house and around my plans. I have already put a coffee cup of the good ol’ water, vinegar and dawn dish soap mixture which does seem to catch quite a few, but a lot do miss that and fly around my apartment. They love flying around our food and near our faces and it drives us INSANE. 
When I water my plants, I notice they fly up from the soil from time to time which then leads me to believe there’s eggs in the soil. I’m posting here to see if anyone has any good tips about soil pesticides or other tips for gnats in general I guess, but I think their main spawn point is my plants, Unfortunately. 
I’ve already taken the opportunity to repot and use new soil but that didn’t necessarily seem to make a difference.

Management has completely culled all of them in the last 3 months, either by firing or pushing them to quit with the contentious way they've been treated. My last friend was just fired this last week, and I'm so sad. 

Everyone is new faces, and they're nice enough, but it isn't the same. We had such a good workflow and great customer relations, where now our workflow is ass bc I'm the only one who knows what I'm doing and the customers are mad bc everything is getting fucked up lol. It just sucks bc I love working here but it's like the joy has just been sucked out. 

I'm also just constantly worried about being fired, since everyone else has. I'm just waiting for that phone call ( which is the only way they fire you- they call you on your day off and don't let you get a word in). I was so excited for the holidays bc it's my favorite time as a barista but now I'm just thinking of leaving (which is complicated, I'm sorta trapped where I am for now). Thanks for letting me vent.

1grch91,https://www.reddit.com/r/FellowProducts/comments/1grch91/aiden_gram_measurements_seem_odd/,Aiden gram measurements seem odd,"Hey all, I just got my Aiden today and something seems odd about the measurements it's giving me for how much coffee to add. For instance it told me to add 18.7 (or 4tbsp) grams of coffee for a 300ml brew but according to my scale 18.7 grams was over half the bag. I added the 4tbsp and it came out to 4.9g and the cup came out fine. Similarly for cold brew it called for 107.1g or 21.5tbsp. I'm running cold brew right now and that amount didn't actually fit in the filter.

Not sure where I'm going wrong here. I've had no reason to suspect my scale is wrong until now, I've not used it in close to a year but it was my daily pourover scale until I just stopped drinking coffee for a while.",1,1731611194.0,FellowProducts,6,1.0,False

1grcf41,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1grcf41/coffee_roaster_for_classroomvocational_training/,Coffee Roaster for Classroom/Vocational Training Program.,"I have a particular set of needs for a roaster that makes my situation a little bit unique.  I am a Culinary Arts Teacher at a vocational training program that serves students aged 18-22 with moderate to severe special needs.  We run a small on campus cafe that serves food to students and staff.  As a home coffee roaster of 10 years, I brought in my Gene Cafe to teach students to roast coffee to sell (whole bean) or for our espresso based drinks.  (espresso maker also an old model from my home.)  My boss is impressed with our coffee and would like to expand our program.  We could sell whole bean coffee to teachers at other campus in our district, as well as other similar student run coffee shops on other campuses.  I have primarily been looking at the Bullet and the Kaleido M6 as our roaster options.  Please let me know if there are other roasters I should be considering.  A few things that I am concerned about are:  The device will likely not be able to be connected to WiFi.  Working for a school district that has been the target of multiple cyber attacks means that very few devices are allowed to be connected to wifi, and those that are have to be devices that our IT department is familiar with.  If they require frequent updates, that could be an issue.  However, I do have a hot spot on my phone that I could use occasionally.  Additionally, the only ""laptops"" that I have available on a consistent basis are chromebooks.  It looks like the bullet needs a program set on a windows laptop in order to be set up.  I can bring my personal laptop to do an initial set up, but it would not really be functional for most tasks, since it will not be connected to wifi.  

  
I have two 20 amp circuits in my commercial kitchen that do not have anything else running on them, so I believe the power requirements for these machines should be met.  I am a little concerned about the exhaust if I have to use an indoor plug instead of the outdoor roasting I have done with my Gene Cafe.  Neither of these circuits are very close to my vent hood.  I'm not sure what the best way to address that issue is.  Anyway, I'm just looking for thoughts before I pull the trigger on a roaster.  We have made about $5k that I can spend on a roaster if necessary.",3,1731611043.0,roasting,2,1.0,False

1grcdrf,https://www.reddit.com/r/askmomaboutcooking/comments/1grcdrf/tip_of_the_day_buy_big/,Tip of the Day- Buy Big ,"Buy Big- 



Years ago, a successful woman I knew gave me  the best advice I've ever received: **""Buy Big.""**

She explained that when she was young, she used to go to discount shops like Steinmart (back in the day) and buy little things like guest towels, earrings, and cheap shoes, wasting hundreds of dollars. Instead of saving that money and buying high-quality items that she would have forever, she wasted money on small items that eventually ended up in the trash or at a landfill. 

She bought small. 

  
In this world of hyper-consumerism, ""Buy Big"" has never been more important. 

Stop spending your hard-earned money on Instagram and Tik Tok fast fashion clothes, expensive coffee, and cheap bric-a-brac made in China. 

  
Instead, save up for a painting, that quality sofa with exactly the fabric you want, higher-end shoes, and clothes with classic lines that will last you for years- not just a trend to fill your closet. Or how about putting a bit of money into an index fund every week? 

Stop spending. Buy Big.

I'm married to my long-term partner (NB27) and engaged to my fiancé (M31) but I'm looking for something new!

Some of my interests: 
Board games (like a huge variety), cats, music, crystals, tattoos, piercings, unhinged memes, TikTok, coffee/energy drinks and reading (horror and smut specifically) 

About me:
I have brown hair typically but I do love dying my hair. Hazel eyes that get called pretty often. I'm a hopeless romantic who loves to cuddle, go on cute dates, send sweet memes/TikToks, I'm loyal and empathetic (almost to a fault), I cannot stand dry conversations, I tend to wear shorts and t-shirts because they're comfy. I'm not religious and very liberal. I'm also a mom! 

What I'm looking for: 
I would love someone who will let me be clingy, respond in a timely manner (or let me know that you're away/busy), have a dark sense of humor, and is open and honest, I tend to prefer thick body types but I'm more into your personality. 

I'm currently looking for online and long-term, but I'd love some new friends, and would be interested in-person if we hit it off, dms are open! ♥️",0,1731610846.0,polyamoryR4R,1,0.33,False

1grcb6f,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalmysteries/comments/1grcb6f/insomnia_nightmare/,Insomnia nightmare,"I'm 37 years old. In August, digesting food stopped feeling normal—I experienced the sort of mild discomfort, the sort of radio static feeling, that, in the past, taking probiotics for a day or two addressed successfully. That did not do anything. Then the matter of successfully digesting anything became very fraught, and the need for my body to eliminate everything, particularly all moisture, kept me up at night going to the bathroom. I went to urgent care—I am still trying to get an appointment with a general practitioner because the last one I tried to engage turned out to be an anti-vaxxer—and was prescribed, essentially, Imodium.( I will add here that I am not in the habit of taking medication. The only two over-the-counter pills I take with any regularity, which will become relevant to the story, are Excedrin Migraine and Midol.) The physician's assistant who saw me assumed, based on things I shared with him, that I was experiencing IBS. It is possible that I've had IBS for a long time, and I didn't disagree with that, but I left feeling that that was not what I was experiencing. Something had changed. Something felt off, and I couldn't fix it by any of my usual means.

September started. At the beginning of the pandemic, I started learning music—how to read it and play piano—for the first time, and for the last two years or so, I've taken composing classes online. I was accepted into the advanced level. I was so, so excited. Then, two weeks after classes started, on Sunday, Sept. 29, I didn't sleep. Sleep has always been fraught for me—when I was a child, I experienced seizures in my sleep. I don't have any memory of this, but my mother told me about it and would fretfully refer to it when, as I was growing up, I resisted sleep. I always went down restlessly, wanting to keep reading or doing whatever I wanted to do, and would be tired all day. I started to drink coffee in high school. I love coffee—I've had it most days of my life. I met my partner when I worked in a coffee shop. Since college, with the passage of time, I developed a much more harmonious relationship to sleep. I love to sleep. I love to feel rested. My habits were still not very healthy—between writing music and writing a long novel, plus having a full-time job and a part-time job (both remote), I would stay up quite light, particularly in the last five years (since the pandemic), knowing that if I had coffee in the morning, I'd be fine. Being able to be so immersed in work has helped me cope with the fact that, right before the pandemic, my mother died very quickly of ovarian cancer.

I didn't sleep the night of Sept. 29. Then, at random, I wouldn't sleep other days. Particularly for three consecutive Sundays. I do not have the Sunday Scaries. I do not have anxiety. While my mother was dying, I spent nine months researching and producing a report on gun violence for an American politician, something that you know was brutal AND fruitless, and it did not affect my ability to sleep one bit. On Sept. 30, when I woke up, I could feel something inside of me buzzing. The popular opinion is that this is my colon, and it's been spasming and irritating my bladder. But I wasn't being kept awake at night with a need to go to the bathroom. That comes and goes, but the visceral hyperawareness was constant, and the complete inability to sleep came out of the blue.

I received a prescription from urgent care for Ambien, which enabled me to stop experiencing anxiety around attempts to go to sleep and try to experiment and find out what was giving me sleepless nights (I will add that despite not sleeping at night, my body clocked and sought to recoup that sleep, and I would easily fall asleep at 7 a.m., 9 a.m., noon, etc., which, you know, I have to respond to the needs of capitalism, so I have to go to sleep at night and wake up in the morning). This gave me the nerve to cut out caffeine, which I was almost frightened to do—I still have to be awake and alert, which I've never been able to be, really, without coffee—and that seemed to do it! That seemed like it fixed the sleeplessness! My visceral hyperawareness was still there, sometimes my bladder still bothered me at night, but ditching caffeine seemed to do it. This led to more experimentation. It seems like consuming a conspicuous amount of sugar—say, a drink from Starbucks or a slice of cake from a commercial bakery—also renders me unable to sleep one wink throughout the night. Ditto if I eat something my body simply hates—for years, I've experienced lactose intolerance, but now, if I have dairy, my body goes tries to eliminate it and everything else in my system with impunity. As I've been testing this out, I also had an occasion to take Midol again, and lo, I didn't know—never had an occasion to notice before—that it has caffeine in it. It never bothered me before. I took it on the night of Oct. 28 and did not sleep. Since then, I've had two more sleepless nights. Now, the number of Ambien I have is dwindling, and simply avoiding caffeine and sugar does not seem to guarantee a night's sleep, even as I've increased my exercise activity to be more intense than it's ever been. When I go to bed, I am so, so tired. When I shut my eyes, nothing feels familiar. My powers of visualization are weakened. I can't just think about the nice things I used to think about to relax myself anymore. I've leaned into my aural imagination, thinking about my favorite songs. Sometimes that helps, but if I'm not going to sleep, I'm just going to be looping the theme from Stephen Sondheim's COMPANY until 4 a.m., and then I cry.

A GI specialist examined me two weeks ago and determined that I had an infection that has since passed, but I am still experiencing most of the symptoms that started to occur toward the end of August, particularly a feeling of tightness in my guts. I spoke to a sleep specialist when I was very confident that abandoning caffeine solved my problem, and now I am trying desperately to reengage them. I don't know what's happening to me. I feel that whatever was going on with my GI tract has reached my brain. I don't know. I am not a doctor. I'm just terrified. I need to sleep. I need to not live in fear that if I eat the wrong thing—and eating already was not easy for me—I will simply not be able to sleep at night. Other people don't have this problem. That being said, I can't imagine this has never happened to anybody else, which is why I wanted to talk about it here. If any of this sounds familiar to you, I'd be so grateful if you reached out.

Here’s a list of 5 foods that science has linked to improved brain power:

**1. Green, Leafy Vegetables** 🥬  
Think kale, spinach, collards, and broccoli. These leafy greens are loaded with brain-friendly nutrients like vitamin K, lutein, folate, and beta carotene. Research suggests they may help slow down cognitive decline as we age. A simple salad or green smoothie could be a powerful addition to your routine. 

**2. Fatty Fish** 🐟  
Fatty fish (like salmon, cod, and tuna) are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which are crucial for brain health. These healthy fats have been linked to lower levels of beta-amyloid, the protein that can form damaging clumps in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients. Aim for fish twice a week. Not a fan? You can still get omega-3s from flaxseeds, avocados, or walnuts.

**3. Berries** 🍓  
Berries are packed with flavonoids, the natural pigments that give them their bright colors. Research shows that these flavonoids can help improve memory. One study found that just two servings of strawberries or blueberries each week can delay memory decline by up to 2.5 years. Easy, tasty, and brain-friendly.

**4. Tea and Coffee** ☕  
Your daily dose of caffeine may be doing more than just waking you up. Studies suggest that caffeine can boost mental function and help with memory retention. Johns Hopkins researchers found that people who consumed caffeine after studying were better able to remember information the next day. So, enjoy that morning cup with a little more confidence.

**5. Walnuts** 🌰  
These little powerhouses of healthy fats are especially good for your brain. Walnuts contain a type of omega-3 fatty acid known as ALA, which has been linked to better cognitive test scores. Plus, they’re great for heart health, which in turn supports brain health. Snack on a handful for an easy brain boost. ",1,1731610586.0,NootropicsOverview,0,1.0,False

Eventually I agreed to go with him because I knew how much it mattered to him and I figured I might as well give church another chance. 

When I agreed, he informed me that his ex goes to that same church. Which made me a little more apprehensive and considered not going at all. I told him that it feels kind of weird to me and it made me feel a little more anxious about going.
I asked him why we couldnt just go to another church, but he explained that he tried other churches but they just didnt really align with his personal views of christianity. Plus, despite his ex going there, all of his friends also go there. 

We went, and it was extremely uncomfortable for me. Immediately she spotted us. At first my bf helped me avoid her and we sat off to the side, but she sat down after us and sat within perfect view of us. I tried to brush it off and just relax and focus on trying to enjoy my time.

The sermon ended and I really had to go to the washroom, so I got up pretty much as soon as it was over so I could be the first one out of the auditorium. She followed me to the bathroom and just washed her hands, she watched me in the mirror and glared at me. I expected a few dirty looks, but it made me feel unwelcome regardless.

Afterwards my bf and I were grabbing some coffee and waiting for his friends to finish up in the auditorium. While we were chatting he mentioned that she came by and said hi to him while I was in the washroom, I said “thats good shes being nice to you!” And didnt mention her behaviour towards me in the washroom. We chatted some more and I could see her walking circles around us, pacing between the auditorium and the coffee station. She kept glancing over at me. My bfs back was turned to her so he didnt see anything. Again, I felt quite uncomfortable at this point, but didnt mention anything to him.

We found his friends and chatted for a while, it was good. I was finally enjoying my time and laughing with them all. But there was a group of girls about 10 feet behind us and as soon as his ex saw us she joined the group of girls. I heard the girls saying things like “as my sister in christ I just have to tell you….” And then all I could hear after that was whispering and giggling. I tried to tell myself that they werent talking about me, but it was extremely difficult to push those thoughts aside based on her previous behaviour and past behaviour that my bf told me about.

We chatted with his friends for about 15 minutes and all of a sudden she joins the group. Of course she chose to budge in right next to my bf, touching, shoulder to shoulder, and asked his friends if they would like to join her for brunch. But his friends were all busy and said they couldnt, my bf mentioned to them that him and I were also going to brunch and getting pretty hungry, he excused us and we left. 
She followed us. All the way to his car. About 5 feet behind us the whole time. When we got to his car she just continued walking past. We sat down and I admitted to him that I had a horrible experience and was very uncomfortable, I told him about all the micro predatory things she was doing and he validated my anxiety and discomfort. 

As we were leaving the parking lot, he rolled his windows down and blasted music, he purposely drive past her fast and with the music blaring. Which irritated me a little because as soon as she was out of earshot he turned the music back down. I told him that was weird behaviour on his part and it made me feel like he was just dating me to make her jealous. He reassured me he wasn’t and just wanted to piss her off for behaving the way she did in church. We had an argument over brunch about it. I asked him if he was over her, he said he was. I told him I felt really uncomfortable about the whole situation, he told me not to worry. 

The whole situation made me feel really insecure about myself. Shes shorter, skinnier, prettier than me. My bf disagrees, but I’ve had other people agree. 

Now, months later, he wants me to go again. He would go with or without me so im going to go, but I am extremely anxious about it seeing as how the last time was pretty unpleasant. 

AIO about the whole situation? Is it reasonable for me to feel like he might not be over her? 

TLDR: my bf goes to the same church as his ex, we went together and she behaved weird towards me, borderline predatory. He wants me to go again, knowing how uncomfortable I was last time.

Talk about a plot twist, right? 😅

I'll be honest - when I first rolled into town, my outdoor experience mostly consisted of taking Zoom calls from beachside bars in Bali. But something about these White Mountains called to me. Maybe it was the way Mount Washington loomed in the distance like some moody teenager trying to hide behind clouds, or maybe I was just tired of explaining time zones to clients. (""No, I'm not actually in Portugal anymore..."")

The first few days, I played it safe. You know, working from Frontside Coffee Roasters, pretending I knew what ""scrambling"" meant when other hikers talked about their routes. But there's only so long you can stare at those peaks through your laptop screen before FOMO kicks in hard.

So yesterday, I decided to tackle the Welch-Dickey Loop Trail. ""Moderate,"" they said. ""Great views,"" they said. What they didn't say was that my city-soft muscles would be screaming halfway up. But here's the thing about hiking in the Whites - just when you're ready to turn around and admit defeat, you hit one of those granite ledges that opens up to views that make your Instagram filters obsolete.

There I was, perched on sun-warmed rock, watching hawks ride thermals below me (BELOW me!), when it hit me - this is what those outdoor influencers are always going on about. That feeling of being simultaneously tiny and infinite. Of course, I ruined the moment by trying to get the perfect selfie and almost dropping my phone down the mountain. Real spiritual growth happening here, folks. 🏔️

The trail network here is ridiculous. It's like someone took all the best parts of nature and created an adventure buffet. Want waterfalls? Got 'em. Alpine zones? Check. Rock scrambles that make you question your life choices? Oh yeah, plenty of those. And the best part? You can still catch up on Slack messages from the summit, though I'm not saying you should (looking at you, workaholic past self).

The locals here crack me up. They casually drop phrases like ""yeah, just bagged the Presidential Traverse last weekend"" like they're talking about picking up groceries. Meanwhile, I'm celebrating not getting lost on the way to Diana's Baths (which, by the way, is not actually a Roman spa - learned that one the hard way).

But you know what's really getting to me? The way this place is changing my definition of ""office views."" My standing desk in my studio apartment back home suddenly seems... lacking. Like, severely lacking. Why stare at a motivational poster when you could be watching morning fog lift off the Saco River?

I came here thinking I'd stay a week, maybe two. That was a month ago. Now I'm googling ""how to winterize a human"" because leaving seems impossible. There's something addictive about this place - maybe it's the clean air, or the way every trail feels like it's hiding some secret vista, or just the fact that my coffee tastes better when I'm watching sunrise alpenglow paint Cathedral Ledge.

To my fellow digital nomads: if you're tired of the usual circuits - the Chaing Mais and Medellíns of the world - point your compass toward the Whites. Just be warned: those mountains have a way of turning ""just passing through"" into ""looking at real estate listings."" And pack better hiking socks than I did. Trust me on this one.

P.S. If anyone needs me, I'll be at Frontside, icing my knees and planning tomorrow's trail adventure. Because apparently, I'm a mountain person now. Who knew? 🥾✨",1,1731610220.0,NorthConwayNH,0,1.0,False
1grc33d,https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Cat_n_ewRXk,"""Whoever is in charge of the traffic situation has thrown an absolute hand grenade at Belfast""","Traffic congestion in a major city is nothing new but over recent weeks the issue has seen Belfast grind to a halt at peak times and it's driving commuters, business owners and public transport providers round the bend.

Ongoing work around the new £340 million Grand Central Station and a major resurfacing scheme of the A2 Sydenham Bypass are contributing to serious traffic congestion in the city. Further concerns have also been raised due to the 12-month closure of Durham Street, as part of public realm works around the new public transport hub.

Over recent weeks during the evening rush hour, Translink has advised of delays to some bus services in the city due to the heavy traffic congestion. It prompted hospitality organisations to call for a moratorium on roadworks on arterial routes over Christmas to provide support to businesses over the festive period.

As part of a new series Belfast Live has been speaking to some of those in retail, hospitality, public transport along with commuters about what can be done to help make Belfast more accessible and alleviate some of the current congestion issues, especially in the run up to Christmas.

Chris Suitor and his family have been trading in the city centre for decades with their tailoring business, Suitor Bros Clothiers and Custom Tailors, based on Arthur Street. He has also dipped his toes into the hospitality sector in recent years after launching Suitor Coffee with his wife Nichola, starting out as an events van and now trading in nearby Holywood.

But Chris is one of the key voices expressing concern about the future of the city centre and is calling for a culture change in leadership to help drive Belfast forward.

He told us: ""Belfast over the last 12 months has definitely seen a rapid rise in my opinion. Number one, from a tourism and hospitality perspective. and number two from a business perspective with lots of big multinational retailers coming to the town.

""You've got Deichmann, you've got the Apple Store and H&M moving into new and bigger premises and you've got The Ivy, Amelia Hall and The Foundry. The streets in my opinion are getting a little bit cleaner too and there's definitely been a real buzz about Belfast.

""In my opinion, things were going really, really good until DfI and roads and whoever is in charge of the traffic situation has thrown an absolute hand grenade at Belfast. It has caused a strangulation of the city centre around peak times, which is having a knock on effect to business across the board in the city with the Sydenham bypass, Great Victoria Street, Durham Street and Grosvenor Road works.

""You've got the Dublin Road works then outside of Belfast, you've got the Saintfield Road, Upper Newtownards Road and stuff going on in north and south Belfast. It seems to me that they have allowed these works to happen all in one go and from a business strategy perspective, that is just a disaster for the city.

""It does cause huge issues with traffic and moving cars and buses and bikes around the city and a habit change. That means people can't get into the city so they go somewhere else to some of the satellite towns like Lisburn, Ballymena, Newtownards. And do you know what they're all great towns with great amenities and they've got free parking and there's no red coats chasing you up and down the street trying to give you a parking ticket.

""Once that habit changes I feel that it could cause a lot of people maybe not to come back to the city because they find what they need outside of Belfast and that for me as a Belfast city business owner is terrible.""

The Department for Infrastructure (DfI) has already said it will suspend non-essential works on key Belfast routes from November 25th until early January, as it had done in previous years., but those in business like Chris have called for an earlier pre-Christmas pause on city centre roadworks.

""For me, we need to change that. We need to bring it in right at the start of November or maybe even earlier. It should be the three months running up to Christmas - October, November and December - because this is our harvest period for all businesses including hospitality and retail.

""There should be no external issues brought into the city in those three months. We should be allowed to try and get as much money into the businesses as possible and create a lovely shopping environment for people,"" Chris added.

""That means that in January, February and March, when it does get quiet out there, businesses will have made enough money in the previous three months to make sure that they can survive through the lean months in the winter.""

On top of that, the Covid-19 hangover still looms large for those trading in the city centre with more and more people working from home, meaning less footfall with the city as Chris explained: ""I also have a hospitality business and things are still so tight. That's the sector that I fear this kind of strangulation of Belfast will have the most impact on.

""Within most retail stores, you own the stock or you will have stock at the end of the month you can sell if you're in a deficit. Hospitality don't have that and are only ever four, six or eight weeks away from the breadline.

""They will not survive it to January, February and March, which is why it's so important that the department gets on top of this now, fixes it now and makes the changes.""

Despite the challenges, Chris remains optimistic and believes the city can be saved with a little more planning: ""I have said this numerous times that lessons need to be learned and we cannot have this happen next year. This is where there needs to be legislative change like bringing that roadworks moratorium further back so that this does not happen next year or the year after.""",1,1731610198.0,northernireland,2,0.57,False

1grbzc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/toddlers/comments/1grbzc0/2_year_old_complete_personality_change_overnight/,2 year old complete personality change overnight,"I've spent the last week and half really trying to do my own research and diving before posting to reddit where things can get pretty messy at times, but I am at my wits end. This is going to be long and detailed because I want to weed out the obvious responses now.

My 2 year, 8 month old daughter has COMPLETELY changed. IF it were not for her appearance I honestly would not think she is my own. Shes a bit.. I'll go with unique, as are all children. But any-time you get that stereotypical ""Every child's different"" cop out answer, that's my daughter. Nothing has been straight-forward with her, she's a bit slow to a few of her milestones, but overall she functions the same as any other toddler. She is small, but my wife and I are also small. We have not done any autism testing because we do not believe she is based on criteria that won't be in this post.

Lets get the dynamic laid out for you. My wife works from home full time, and I now work part time to help her during the day with our daughter. Childcare is pretty pricey so we opted to not have her in daycare. No we do not qualify for any level of state aid to help with this scenario. I work in the Mornings 6am to 10-11am every weekday then come home for lunch and take over the reins for the most part. My daughter goes to bed at 8pm (but rolls around in crib for any amount of time until she actually goes to sleep.) She is woken up at 8am most mornings, give or take a half hour depending on any morning issues. Lunch is at 11, and nap-time generally was around 1 that we'd get her laid down, sometimes 1:30. Then regardless of the nap we'd get her at 3:30. Her routine is very firm, only bending occasionally for things out of our control. We know routine is key, so we've always stuck by that. Our daughter is alright with asking for things (very simple, we believe she has some speech delay), Her usual words we're used to hearing is ""Skip."" when she wants us to change something on TV. ""Up/Down."" ""All Done."" ""Clean up. (after meals)"" ""Ball-pit. (usually means she knows its naptime, there's a ball pit in her room)"" ""Hungry."" ""Snack"" ""Bubbles (SHE LOVES BUBBLES)"" ""Ball (She loves to chase a ball around kind of in a soccer way, but she crawls versus walking)"" and maybe a few other random ones. She is played with regularly, dragging me into her playpen to play every day (after she's already done it to my wife). And her love of bubbles was always so intense that we never let my wife blow them or she'd never have peace while trying to work. Our daughter wanted them CONSTANTLY. It was hard to curve her into being okay with them being done, but we got there.

It started a little over a week ago. We were all just getting over a family cold, you know how that goes. She was pretty normal through the cold, doing all the same things she always did, just snottier. She did have one rough night, which was unusual for her, where she did not want to be left in her crib. Demanding ""Up!"" constantly. If we did not, she'd thrash inside the crib. This was already a bit unusual, she doesn't throw many tantrums honestly, nothing that isn't fairly textbook, and we navigate it pretty case by case. I attributed it to the night before she threw up a couple times from coughing too much and she wanted to feel more secure. It was a hard night. I'd leave her when I thought she was calm enough to find her losing her mind in the crib. Thrashing and hair pulling like crazy. And when I say hair pulling, I mean HAIR PULLING. Huge clumps of hair, it was horrifying. But the next day/night she seemed fine. It was a very stressful thing.

Things seemed to be returning to normal until one night (again, about a week ago), my wife took her up to bed after her bath (we both take part in bathtime and bedtime), and my daughter starts having a fit about going to bed. We half expected it, she had skipped her nap that day, so for her to be upset was no big deal, we'd navigate it. But it notably a bit more extreme than we were used to. But she went to bed in the end, seemly over the fit. Next day she woke up happy again, as normal. Her routine seemed fairly straight forward again as usual, but this time when we took her out of the bath she got very upset. It happens from time to time, who doesn't love playing in water? We got her ready for bed in the bathroom as always, then escorted the crying toddler to the stairs to climb up to bed. Her meltdown got worse, eventually we carried her up because there was no hope of her crawling up the stairs and it was getting late. Again she'd skipped her nap. (When I say she skipped a nap, I mean we put her down for her nap, but she just rolled around and sung songs for the entire time). We still put her down for it to be her ""quiet time.""

She pretty quickly demanded ""bed"" but kept freaking out for a while, we could tell she didn't mean bed, and there was a communication breakdown happening. But we did what we could, eventually agreeing to put her to bed. She seemed overall fine again in the bed, but it was more exhausting the second time. Next day, same issues, skipped nap, got to the time of night for bath, then meltdown. She did not want to take a bath this time. Clearly things seemed to be dominoing. First bed, then bath. Once in the bath after a bit she generally calms down because she starts having fun, but this time she was not having it. screamed the whole bath, the whole dry-off/get ready for bed procedure, and up to bed, and bed its self. If counting, that's 4 meltdowns. Eventually we got her to bed as calmly as the other nights. Next day, the diaper change before the bath, next day, dinner, next day, before nap, next day diaper change when I get home from work. For those counting, that's 14 meltdowns just from doing what she did every day for her whole life.

Between just the meltdowns she stopped going into the playpen to play. She stopped playing ball, she would ask for bubbles, but the moment you got to the cupboard to get them she'd shout ""DONE"" and at that point if you pulled them out or put them away no matter what you were getting a high level meltdown. This coming from her asking for bubbles several times a day because she loved to chase them, to now never asking. She'd ask to play on occasion but if you (well, me, I'm not sure how often it happened with my wife), touched ANYTHING she was playing with she'd shout ""DONE."" and freak out, having another meltdown, taking things from you and putting them away. She used to shout ""We got a runner!"" before diapers and run around to be caught for the diaper change. Obviously she just copied us saying it but it was harmless. She will sometimes say it now, but catching her is an immediate meltdown, and not playing is a meltdown. There are NO winning scenarios. If you try to play along with her, you lose. Unlike the laughter of chasing her and the tickles she'd get once caught. If you try to encourage whatever thought she's having, you lose. If you so much as take your shoes off, she WILL freak out. Thats not an exaggeration, if she sees you take them off, she tells you to put them on like you're doing something terrible. But if you take them off around the corner and walk back she doesn't say a word, as long as she doesn't realize. 

Enough was enough, I was fed up, I could not take it anymore. I took her to the pediatrician looking for any kind of help, nothing I could find on the internet was helping or giving me any kind of hope. At this point her poor hair had two very visible thin patches on each side of her head. But basically they said, ""eh, you guys were just sick. She's probably still upset about it. Plus terrible twos, am I right?"" It was the most invalidating experience I'd ever had at a doctors visit. ""She's testing boundaries, just do your best to redirect it."" I made my case, explaining something is very wrong, and we don't know what to do. You CANNOT redirect her. Even trying to hold her to calm her down just MAKES HER FURIOUS. She has NEVER liked being held. She has NEVER slept on my wife or I, even as a new-born. She will only sleep in her crib no matter how tired she is. She's never slept in a car seat, never slept on a couch, or any other common place a toddler may lay or sit. Not ONCE. She doesn't do hugs, or kisses, unless someone forces them on her. She doesn't mind being held, but since the transition she wants ""UP!"" constantly. She'll temporarily calm down for a few minutes, but if you try to put her down you're right back at square one. It does not matter how long you hold her, which solves nothing. After that visit she continued to be an absolute monster the moment we got home. 

My wife had to go away for work for a couple days, so I've been alone with my daughter. It was bad timing, but nothing we could do. I'm a very strong willed person, I'm not easily dissuade by a hard situation or being against any kinds of odds. But she has absolutely destroyed me since this started. The inability to do ANYTHING (Like I said, I can't even take off my slippers), and any intervention I try is met with these meltdowns. Whether the intervention is attempting to redirect her, hold her to calm her, or let her have her fit and watch. 

This morning the domino effect reached getting out of bed. She was completely calm, I got her up from her crib as we always do, and she was not happy when I changed her clothes, throwing a fit, but not quite a meltdown yet. I had taken her socks off the night before, which we had been too scared to do because socks off meant laying down. So she picked up on that, so if you took her socks off she'd meltdown. This morning putting them on was similar to taking them off. But I got her ready and downstairs for some morning bluey while I made her a waffle and got her some fruit. She had a complete meltdown because bluey was on. I offered to change it but she kept shouting ""BLUEY!"" over and over as she thrashed. Finally I turned it off because nothing was helping, also the wrong call (Again there is no winning). As I tried to calm her down she just kept throwing herself on the ground and hitting her head off the floor or pulling hair. I moved to a new location to try and calm her and she threw everything off the coffee table (crayons, coloring books, cup, you name it.). I took the crayons away from her and she lost it harder. 30 minutes goes by and she starts shouting ""BED!"" so I scooped her up and took her upstairs. I set her in her crib and she stopped crying. This is the FIRST time she's ever even asked for bed. 

She sits in the bed for 20 minutes, I take her back downstairs hoping she will be calmer. No real luck. She was calm long enough to eat some banana and a piece of toast. She asked for bubbles, I reluctantly walk to the cupboard and sure enough it turned into no matter what you do you're going to be wrong. I try to redirect to something else, she continues to freak out, thrashing about. Finally she goes into my office and starts playing with some CD cases that were colorful and she chills out long enough for me to START writing this. At the time of me getting to this point I have stopped 36 times to deal with mini episodes. She was quiet for a bit but she started asking for ""Soap"" in my office. Which is what she calls the air febreze air freshener in my office. I try to hide it because if she had her way I'd use it all at once for fun. I did three sprays and said all done. (I do this with BIG bubbles sometimes, since it can be tedious blowing dozens of bubbles some days). She melts down again. I try to stop her and she bites me so hard I start bleeding through my shirt. She just lunged and bit like an animal. When I told her no as sternly as I could she slapped me across my face, then headbutted me before I had time to react.

I put her down and she then keeps yanking her hair and hitting her head off the floor. I regained my composure and I tried to help her again, eventually she stopped throwing her fit, but it was very obvious she wanted to keep biting me, so I had to abandon that tactic of trying to hold her. If I put my arms around her it was very obvious I was going to be bitten wherever she could manage to get her teeth. I heard a giggle in her voice when I tried pushing her face away so that really set me off, and I stopped any intervention after that point. This so has all taken place within an hour and a half since waking up for those following along. From that point it was just meltdown after meltdown. She came into the kitchen where I was trying to gather myself and threw her ball like she wanted to play. But as soon as it touched the ground she had a meltdown. She actually tried to take me into the playpen but as soon as I said a word she had a meltdown. I managed to change her diaper but pretty soon I'm going to need a straight jacket to do so. It takes 3 people just to look into her ears at the doctor, she's very strong for her size. So doing a diaper when she's throwing a fit is like nothing my mother had ever seen in her life. 

We make it to 11am, so I start wondering how on earth I was going to manage to make her lunch. I throw some stuff in the air fryer and let it do its thing. Meanwhile she's back in my office, which I have to watch her pretty close in there because its not really super toddler proof without at least a little supervision. But she has a few more fits because of frustration. I keep ignoring her pleas to be picked up because that is now her way of trying to bite me, I do cave once and tell her to relax while I do it, she immediately tries to bite me. So I put her back down (Imagine the scene from Childs play when Chucky is trying to bite the mom). I try spinning her around and hugging her while squatted, but she tries to bite my arms. or keeps throwing her head back to hit me.  I let her go and continue her fit. She eventually calms down when I put on a disney movie. We make it about 3 minutes and I set her plate on the table, I had no intention of calling her to sit I was just going to sit and see if she got curious because she was acting hungry. She saw the plate and ran for my office screaming, my office is on the other side of the house. I walk across the house to get her out of my office since its not safe alone and she's throwing anything she can find all over the floor like a maniac. I pick her up and take her out of my office and close the door. However there is a cat door that she starts desperately trying to climb through. She's too big to get through, but not small enough that she won't hurt herself. So I pull her away from it and block it with a big box. She's never tried to go through that mini door in her life. So she finds a little corner next to the box where she melts down again.

Some time passes and I try to bring her back to the living room. She stands still for a moment but then sees me pick the plate off the table, it was obvious she wasn't going to eat. She freaks out again and runs back to the corner spot that I made with the box. at this point its 12:30. So 4 hours has gone by, I give up hope and pick her up, and put her in her crib, and left. She melts down as I close the door, but I'm exhausted and seconds from having my own meltdown. My wife should be home from her business venture in a couple hours. 

So if you've made it this far, thank you, seriously, at least someone was willing to listen to what I have to say. But has ANYONE had this happen to them? Has anyones toddler become a complete rabid monster seemingly overnight. We have done EVERYTHING we can think of. EVERYTHING other people have suggested, but of course it always boils down to the following:

Testing boundaries, Terrible Twos, just calm them down, redirect their attention, separation anxiety, other textbook answers that are the last thing from helpful. 

I want real help without being completely invalidated for asking for help. If I ask for help, I genuinely feel I need it. I try my best not to ask for help if its not necessary. But as it stands right now, I don't even know the creature I put in her crib 20 minutes ago. I always told people my greatest joy was coming home and being dad. That has devolved into me wishing I was never a parent. Thats how far down she has managed to get me. I've tried having hope each morning, each interaction I put on my customer service persona and do my very best to be what she needs. But it only gets WORSE, there is not a wink of happiness in our day anymore. My wife just cries every night, completely overwhelmed. Neither of us even want to interact with our Daughter because of this new complete change. We have no support system other than ourselves. There is no drop them off at their grandparents. I did that once on Monday (my parents are in their 80s so they can't do much but hang out with her.) and my daughter was there for 5 hours. Longest she'd ever been out of the house other than trips. She was good for them, but as soon as we got home she devolved into the same beast. two days later we took her back and she showed how she really was. Same things she'd do at home, but there, say blocks, you touch a block, she FREAKS out. Screaming ""Done"" and slamming herself all over the house.

We have the number for a behavioral specialist that we're calling today. But even then, I'm exhausted, heartbroken, and ready to throw in the towel. I do not say this lightly when I admit I do not love the child in that crib right now. She has shown me that unconditional love does in fact have conditions. I would still do anything to help my daughter, but I am completely broken at this time. She seems to be asleep in her crib. So I may have an hour of peace while I clean up the absolute tornado she created. 

Things I've considered: She's not napping. So she's clearly irritable from that, but even first thing in the morning now (as today showed) she's mad. So sleep is not the only factor. She is probably operating on 12 hours of sleep a day without her naps. Which should still suffice for most her needs, we still try to get that nap in, but its been a week since she stopped sleeping. But as I mentioned, she is currently asleep since 1pm now. So her meltdowns wore her out enough to sleep. I will probably let her sleep as long as she wants. And hope she sleeps later. Her moms been gone for 48 hours. She's left on trips before and we've always had fun. So in terms of being separated, she handles it well usually. Plus she doesn't freak out the 2 times (yes, TWO times total) we've left her with my parents for us to go out for our anniversary dinner. We've only gone 2, 4 hour periods without her since she's been born. She is clearly having some level of communication breakdown, but she's bright enough to pick up new words. I tried to teach her ""big feels"" when she melts down to help give her words but now if I say ""big feels"" it only amplifies the meltdown, or initiates it. Not feeling well, although she's sneezed a few times the last couple days I don't see any real signs of sickness. Neither did the Pediatrician. Even when dead sick though, she was still happier than she is now. She could be bored, we try to keep things fresh, new activities, new places, more going out. She loves asking for shoes to go places. But weather is lousy at the moment, so the timing is terrible. I'm sure there are things I'm forgetting, but I'm absolutely exhausted. I've barely eaten in days, I've slept less. And every waking hour with her is just pushed me to the brink of losing it.

So again I ask, anyone experience something like this? And thanks again for listening to my story. I will try and check back as often as I can to answer, converse, and brainstorm. ",1,1731609933.0,toddlers,4,1.0,False

How does your brain work when cancelling due to other obligations etc.? Do you already have a reschedule in mind that you don’t bring up till you’re sure you can make it?

I was talking with an ENTP guy and we hung out a few times over the span of a month and things were flirty and fun. He initiated the first one and a few other “dates” and I reciprocated by suggesting a few other ones we could do. 

Recently, we planned another hangout where he offered to cook dinner for me and he even initiated a coffee date the same weekend. But the night before he texted me asking if we could move to another date because he got out of a meeting with his freelance client and had urgent dues for his project within a few days.

I didn’t necessarily push it and didn’t even touch on the reschedule because I assumed that if he genuinely meant he wanted to move to another date he’d bring it up on his own (I believe the person who cancels is responsible for rescheduling). From the conversation that followed it seems like he has hard deadlines till next month and I just wished him luck and left it like that.

Now I might be jumping to conclusions but I just assumed he lost interest and this is his way of backing out. But I’ve also had other P friends in the past with nearly ADHD like symptoms who genuinely made innocent scheduling errors and I grew to just accept as part of their quirks.

Just not sure if I should take this as him not being interested and move on or if I should just give him more grace and watch how it plays out. 

Just mixed feelings because he did give me concrete details for why he is busy and had to cancel, and this is the first time he cancelled…but also him not rescheduling immediately is??? Not sure if that’s also because he’s unsure of his own schedule for the next month???

1grbtwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1grbtwo/japan_honeymoon_itinerary_check_14_days/,Japan Honeymoon - Itinerary Check (14 Days),"Hello! My husband and I are planning our ""Revenge Honeymoon"" (original got cancelled due to the pandemic) to Japan in March. This is our first time in Japan. We're excited to do the honeymoon we couldn't have afforded to do 5 years ago and we're trying to do a lot while we're there. 

A little about us: we are ""go-go-go"" type travelers but with a laid back approach. We like to plan 1-2 ""big things"" a day and then leave the rest of the day open for meandering/spontaneity. We want to do touristy things (major temples/sights) but love local, hole in the wall/off the beaten path type places, too. We don't mind waking up early to avoid crowds and are moderately active adults in good health. We have a moderate budget and are willing to spend a little $ for convenience/ease of travel (ie: paying for private tours, booking things in advance, etc.) Lastly, as I mentioned, this is our honeymoon...so we are treating ourselves to a few nice dinners and experiences on this trip. We love fine dining and great bars. 

Our trip is 14 days (""on the ground in Japan"" not including flight days) and we are going during the first two weeks of March (trying to avoid the crowds of sakura season). We are planning to do 4-5 days in each city in the Golden Triangle: Tokyo - Osaka - Kyoto (in this order). 

\----

This is our rough itinerary so far. I won't get too detailed, but **I want to know from this overview if we are trying to cram too much in?** Also, is there anything we missed that we should include or swap something out for? 

Tokyo (Hotel: Prince Park Tower Hotel)

* **Day 1 - Arrive in Tokyo (Sat)**
   * Unpack/freshen up at hotel. Train to dinner at Pizza Bar (if we can't get a res we'll do something at the hotel to keep it simple)
* **Day 2 - Nakameguro + Daikanyama shopping day (Sun)**
   * Sleep in (10am), breakfast in bed. Train to Nezu Museum in the morning. Lunch somewhere in the area. Walk to Kyu Asakura House. Coffee break after at Visvim and browse vintage shops in the area. Anniversary dinner at cocon in Nakameguro. Drinks after at Epulor.
* **Day 3 - Shibuya and Shimokitazawa Day (Mon)**

\----

I am mostly concerned about the early start times with so few places being open early for breakfast and wanting to respect the etiquette of not eating/drinking while walking. We figure we'll do a lot of Konbini breakfasts to tide us over (or keep small breakfast items in our hotel rooms that are quick. But any additional advice here is appreciated. 

Also we know that almost everything will be crowded/have a queue. We are prepared for that. I am hoping since we planned Kyoto during the week that will help with some of the big attractions we are trying to see there. **We are pretty laid back and this itinerary reflects ""the dream"" but we understand we might not be able to do ALL of these things and are good with just passing on something if we are too tired or if the wait is too long.**

1grbtvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/h3h3productions/comments/1grbtvb/hear_me_out/,Hear me out...,"Alright, buckle up because I need to explain why I can no longer support Ethan Klein, and let me tell you, this is a long road to get to the punchline. Sure, we’ve all been through the controversies, the drama, the moments of ""I can't believe he said that,"" and the memes that have made H3 a unique corner of the internet. But the real dealbreaker for me? His tardiness. It’s not just the late starts—it’s the *unpredictability* of it, the sense of waiting for a show to begin that feels like you're waiting for the *front to fall off* every single time.

When Ethan first launched the H3 podcast, it felt like a breath of fresh air—wild, unapologetic, and with a sense of humor that made you feel like you were in on the joke. It was raw, honest, and had a chaotic energy that felt genuine. You’d get a deep dive into pop culture, some hilarious hot takes, and of course, the viral moments. Who could forget the time they made the ""Howie Mandel prolapse"" joke and had the *audacity* to make it funny? No one was doing it like that.

I was hooked. I set my calendar. I made my plans around it. I was ready for the insanity. But then, slowly but surely, things started to shift. At first, it was just a *little* delay. Maybe Ethan was having a *long conversation* with Dan about their shared obsession with obscure YouTube drama, or perhaps there was a coffee spill at the last minute—life happens, right? No big deal. But then, as time went on, the delays became more frequent. And now, I find myself watching my clock like I’m waiting for *the front to fall off*.

I know we’ve all joked about the “H3 time zone,” but when that becomes the *norm*, it’s like I’m waiting for a show that’s always running on ""Ethan Standard Time"" (EST—Ethan Standard Time), which is two hours later than anyone expected. Every time, I think to myself, “This is fine, I’m sure they’re just running a little behind. Maybe they’re stuck in traffic. Maybe Dan’s lost in a deep rabbit hole watching old *Spy Kids* footage on YouTube. Who knows?” But then it turns into something else—something more sinister. The waiting becomes a meme in itself. And every time I check Twitter, the top tweet is just people asking, “Is Ethan still late? Where’s my podcast?”

It's like the H3 podcast has transformed into a game of “Will they or won’t they?” except it’s not about whether Ethan will pull off a banger of an interview—it’s whether he’ll even show up on time. At first, I was just waiting for a bit. But then, *two hours later*, I'm sitting there like, “Do I need to start a GoFundMe to get Ethan to his own podcast on time?” Like, should I start sending him reminders? Maybe a text that says, ""Hey, Ethan, it’s 3 PM—remember your podcast? People are literally in the comments asking if you’re OK, like they’re worried you’ve been abducted by aliens."" 

And the excuses! Oh, the excuses. We've heard it all. ""Sorry guys, my kids were acting up,"" or ""I had to take care of some personal stuff,"" or my personal favorite, “I was on the phone for an hour with a guy about my new YouTube strategy.” I get it, I really do. Life’s busy. But at some point, it starts to feel like you’re living in a *time loop* of disappointment, where I know I'm getting in the zone, and then BAM—it’s 4 PM, and I’ve just spent my whole afternoon waiting for Ethan to pop up like he’s the guest on his own podcast.

And the worst part? There’s always this moment where Ethan *finally* shows up, like he’s just walked out of some 90s sitcom, and casually says, “Sorry guys, I was just... you know... having a coffee. Wasn’t that a chill coffee?” And I’m sitting there, thinking, “Dude, I could have watched *two full episodes of the H3 Podcast* in the time you’ve made me wait.” I could've gone to the bathroom, made a sandwich, done my laundry, and sent a few texts—all in the time it takes for Ethan to put on his headphones and give us that “I’m ready now” look. But *sure*, Ethan, take your time. I’ll just be here, waiting with bated breath for the one moment when you decide it’s time for a show.

Let’s talk about *the fans* for a second. We’re not just viewers, we’re not just passive consumers—*we’re committed* to this. We *give* you our time. You’re basically stealing our most precious resource, and then, when we ask for the return on our investment, you give us *late-night Ethan* like we’re in some sketchy, unofficial aftershow, “But wait, don’t leave! It’s coming, I swear!” The next thing you know, I’m *half-sleeping* through the intro because I’ve been waiting for two hours. And now I’m questioning everything about my life: “Do I even know what time is anymore? Am I living in a simulation? What is *time*?”

And it’s not just *once* or *twice*—this is like a bad relationship. It’s like being in a relationship with someone who promises they’re “on their way” and then shows up 90 minutes late, looking at you like you’re the crazy one. “Why are you mad? Chill out, I’m here now. What’s the big deal?” Like, no, Ethan, it’s not chill. It’s like when you’re at a party, and you’re waiting for someone to show up and bring the snacks—and instead, you get the last few chips that’ve been sitting on the counter for 45 minutes, cold and stale, and you think, “I’ve been here for *two hours*, and THIS is what you’re serving me?”

At this point, I feel like Ethan’s whole vibe has just become ""How late can we be and still get away with it?"" I’m starting to think it’s a bit like that time Dan and Ethan had that hilarious “how late can you be” segment where Dan kept pushing the envelope, and Ethan just shrugged it off. But now it’s the norm! The show *should* start at a set time, not whenever Ethan decides the stars are aligned.

Here’s the thing: I still love the chaos. I still love the banter. I still love the weirdness, the irreverence, and the randomness that defines H3. But there’s only so much *watching a clock tick away* that I can do. Ethan has built a *brand* on unpredictability, but I need a little *predictability* in my podcast schedule. So until we get some *real* consistency, I guess I’ll have to say, “Sorry, I can’t make it.” 

Because honestly, if I have to sit through one more “technical difficulties” excuse, I’m gonna lose it.",0,1731609541.0,h3h3productions,11,0.23,False
1grbssx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1grbssx,Day 2: Dunkin’ Daily Coffee Review – Espresso Overload Edition,"Alright, folks, here’s Day 2 of my Dunkin’ saga, and wow, they’ve really outdone themselves today. I ordered a macchiato, finally got the French vanilla flavoring right, but... they went overboard on the espresso. We’re talking 75% espresso, 25% milk. This thing looks more like straight-up espresso with a splash of milk – and trust me, that’s not what I signed up for.

Today, I won’t even bother stirring it because I’d end up with nothing but diluted espresso. So, I’m just drinking it the “right” way – a bit off the top and then down to the milk at the bottom. But seriously, if I stirred this, I’d be left with no flavoring or milk taste at all, just an intense, bitter espresso hit. It’s like Dunkin’ decided today was “espresso overload” day.

I thought about going back for a remake, but I’ve had issues with them so many times that I’m just over it. They’re probably tired of me at this point, always coming in and asking them to fix something. I’ve been going here for years, and I’d stop… but hey, the free drinks keep me hanging on. You can’t beat a free coffee, even if it’s hit-or-miss.

As you can see from the photo, it’s espresso city, not much milk in sight. It’s going to be strong, and I already know it’s not going to be a good Dunkin’ day. Sometimes Dunkin’s on point; other times, it’s straight-up Dunkin’ Disappointment – or maybe Crunkin’ Donuts for how crazy they can be with the drink ratios. Or should I say Drunken Donuts, because honestly, it’s like they’re making these with a blindfold on.

So, yeah… not a great day for Dunkin’. Here’s hoping for a better macchiato tomorrow.",1,1731609463.0,DunkinDonuts,4,0.57,False

hello 👋 this will be awkward to type out. I think of myself as an over all good person I typically am nice and calm, but I have had interactions with other people I regret and feel bad for. I normally get along with people and don't fight but there has been more than one occasion a peer has upset me and I've reacted in a way I don't think was correct. I don't do it often and can only think of a few times I've acted in such a way, I could probably count the times on one hand. the problem is when someone upsets me I feel the need to do something back. An example is during college: I had 2 roommates that I didn't get along with. They had done something to really really make me mad, (its a long story with a long build up) and I reacted in a way that makes me feel ashamed. I poured bleach in their plants, and dipped their tooth brushes in the toilet. looking back it was such a stupid and childish reaction but in the moment it felt like the only thing that would get rid of the anger I felt. Another time was with ex friends: things had ended and had been quiet between us for a while, until a mutual person said that they were talking about me. So I texted them some rude insults in response because the fact they were talking about me behind my back made me mad.
this is less embarrassing because it happened when i was probably 10, but i put cinnamon in my grandmas coffee grounds because i was upset she always asked me to make her coffee. those are really my only examples of this kind of behavior, but it's really embarrassing that I would act like that. I don't want to react that way again so any tips on how to deal with the anger and the feeling of needing to get even would be appreciated.

I've been a regular Huel consumer for three years, but always as a supplement, never a food replacement. Huel always made me feel great, but I felt changed after a two-week sprint. Some observations:

1. I lost weight, and my face became noticeably more angular and defined.
2. My skin cleared: I saw better facial color, fewer pimples, and a soft glow.
3. The whites of my eyes became slightly more saturated.
4. My cognition sharpened. I'm a researcher and often notice how subtle changes in sleep/coffee affect my cognitive output. After three days of Huel, I felt clearer than my best 9-hour-of-sleep nights.
5. I felt calmer. After four days, I felt a 'post-meditation peace' (this sprint's most consistently noticeable aspect). Spurts of intense anxiety I occasionally get in the afternoon after drinking too much coffee also disappeared entirely.
6. I had more willpower. I put down my phone easily after doomscrolling. I went to bed earlier. I exercised more often.
7. I drank **a lot** of water—almost a worrying amount. I never quite felt thirsty, just dry, but it was enough to double my average water intake. I grew concerned at a certain point (and asked ChatGPT for advice on water's consumption ceiling), but I never felt sick. The more I drank, the sharper I felt, and I suspect some of my added mental clarity might be because I drank more, not just my diet. I'm curious if anyone else has had this experience.
8. I occasionally felt a sharp, throbbing prefrontal headache. After the \~1600 (out of 2000) calorie mark, there was a 1/3 chance that I'd develop this headache. I'm unsure what caused it—possible dehydration?—but it sucked and weakened my productivity. I might control and record my water intake to check casualty in the future.

This two-week sprint was the most alive I've felt in a long time. I was more productive, patient, and intelligent; it felt magical. It ended when I mistimed my shipment and had to wait a few days for more Huel to arrive. I'm moving to 80% Huel permanently, and I couldn't be more excited!

---

Some Notes:

I consumed exclusively Chocolate v3.1 Powder (not black) with a 2000-calorie diet.

I blend my Huel in a KitchenAid.

The mental clarity/focus I gained from Huel seems under-discussed in this sub. I suspect my longtime veganism—despite my best efforts—is naturally deficient in Omega3/6 and B12. I'm curious if anyone else, vegan or other, has felt similar mental clarity.

One of the girls and i didnt like each other to say the very least. Cate and my other roommate (dana) asked me if i was ok with them seeing our neighbours. I said ok. They've been going to their place for drinking and chatting ect while i go out with other friends. 

2 days ago dana and cate asked if i was cool having the neighbours over this weekend since i will not be home to see some friends out of town. I understood its not polite for them to keep going and never inviting them over. But i felt a like an outsider and left out so i was down that day and didnt join conversations. At night we sat down for some coffee and i decided to let it go and not bring this subject over. 

Today cate didnt really talk to me and ate alone in her room. I asked why she didnt join me and she said she needed to talk to me over something. When we sat down she said she felt that i disrespected her by shutting her down for a day and that she looked for a place to move out. I was puzzled and said i didnt mean it and i did so to bc i needed space to think it over. She said that she felt like a stranger in her house bc of me so she thinks our friendship is irreversably damaged. She thinks its unfair i got hurt when she always asked for my opinion. I didnt want to affect her friendship so i chose to keep quite. She said me moving out with them wasnt her plan at first and how she tolerates her room being the smallest when i have the biggest feels like she sacrificed her comfort for nothing.

I'm John, from the greatest city in the world, Chicago. With a city so big you'd think dating is easy, I wish that was the case. I’m tired of the dating apps and I've had connections on here before so I figured I'd give it another shot!

I work in a very demanding customer service job, it's not my favorite job but at least it's work. On my downtime on weekdays you can find me binging a double feature of two movies l've never seen before.

I'm a big horror nerd, and I get excited to watch things I've never heard of or seen. Currently doing a deep dive into 1970's Italian Horror.

I watch a lot of other stuff too. I basically live on the Tubi app after work. Comedy, action, even some romantic comedies. B movie are also a favorite of mine. I'm literally filled with weird, obscure film recommendations.

420 friendly! I def hit my vape every night after work, it calms me down after a very stressful day. Weekends if I have nothing to do l'll smoke a bit more, but I can def go days without it. Not a deal breaker if that's not your thing!

Outside of watching stuff on weekends I try to stay as active as I can. Summer and fall I love going to the parks out here with my dog, Buddy! He's a 11 year old rescue dog who I got about 4 years ago. He's got my heart and I know you'll love him.

I'm pretty simple! Go out one weekend night a week with friends to shoot some pool and have a few drinks. I tend to visit coffee shops and check out record stores on weekends too.

I'm John, from the greatest city in the world, Chicago. With a city so big you'd think dating is easy, I wish that was the case. I’m tired of the dating apps and I've had connections on here before so I figured I'd give it another shot!

I work in a very demanding customer service job, it's not my favorite job but at least it's work. On my downtime on weekdays you can find me binging a double feature of two movies l've never seen before.

I'm a big horror nerd, and I get excited to watch things I've never heard of or seen. Currently doing a deep dive into 1970's Italian Horror.

I watch a lot of other stuff too. I basically live on the Tubi app after work. Comedy, action, even some romantic comedies. B movie are also a favorite of mine. I'm literally filled with weird, obscure film recommendations.

420 friendly! I def hit my vape every night after work, it calms me down after a very stressful day. Weekends if I have nothing to do l'll smoke a bit more, but I can def go days without it. Not a deal breaker if that's not your thing!

Outside of watching stuff on weekends I try to stay as active as I can. Summer and fall I love going to the parks out here with my dog, Buddy! He's a 11 year old rescue dog who I got about 4 years ago. He's got my heart and I know you'll love him.

I'm pretty simple! Go out one weekend night a week with friends to shoot some pool and have a few drinks. I tend to visit coffee shops and check out record stores on weekends too.

The pay is really good, however I am a full time pre-med college student and i’ll be a full time transporter. I know it’s gonna be a lot so I’m a bit nervous. I originally applied for part time but got offered full time instead (I took it so I can work there and then ask to drop down to part time after some time.) 

Anyways, they called me a few days ago to let me know I got the job however I was in class from 9 to 5 that day. They proceeded to spam call me 3-4 in a span of 10 mins then email me 2-3 times. Not gonna lie it did irritate me because I made them aware I cannot answer the phone on Tuesdays bc of my schedule. It irritated me even more when they had the guy who recommended me, started texting my step dad countless times about the hospital not being able to reach me. Not gonna lie, I did complain to my mom bc I was already having a bad day and that just pushed my buttons. I just needed to get it off my chest. Well today, I got an email from the recruiter that explained all the certifications and requirements I need to get done. I do feel a little overwhelmed due to the fact that it’s a lot to do in 2 weeks when I have to find appointments days, especially with my current job and school. I honestly just mainly wanted to keep her in the loop and again get some things off my chest bc i’m overwhelmed. 

That’s when these text messages come into play. Anyways, so she comes home and I’m a little upset bc I was just trying to share part of the process with her and feel kinda shut down. Then she proceeds to go on a whole rant about how horrible her job at her fast food place is and how much she hates her 5 hour mornings shifts everyday. She was complaining about coworkers, customers, the coffee maker, etc. then getting mad when I wasn’t really responding like I usually do. So i’m not gonna lie I said “well i just feel like you should quit then if you really don’t want this job” and she blew up at me. Keep in mind my mom chooses to work bc she likes being able to buy stuff from amazon, food places, etc. my step dads paycheck alone covers the bills and everything. She went on about how I don’t understand how difficult it is (even though my first job was the same fast food place) and that she’s just trying to express herself. So I kinda blew up back at her and ultimately said “We worked the same job, it’s not that hard. Maybe don’t complain so much about my feelings if you don’t wanna hear the response you gave me back.” Now she’s giving me the silent treatment so I’m wondering if I’m in the wrong, so AIO?",1,1731608538.0,AmIOverreacting,5,1.0,False

Is that result so low that I have no hope of getting it up to normal (300+) levels without testosterone therapy?  Read on for more details:

Had a DEXA scan a few weeks ago; showed low bone density.  Doctor tested my testosterone.  Result was 146 ng/dL, which is pretty low.  The blood was drawn 3 hours after I had completed a 1-hr zone 2 biking session, and I had also had coffee and breakfast already (overnight oats).

Haven't talked to doc yet but am wondering if I have any hope of getting that up to normal levels (300+) by natural means (i.e., no testosterone therapies) such as reduced exercise, increased calorie intake, improved sleep, etc.  Or if people look at that number (146) and think it's so low that I should just go straight to testosterone supplementation if my doc recommends it.

A bit about me:

40M, 5'10, 150 lbs, 13.5% bodyfat (DEXA).  Workout 4 hours zone 2 cycling per week, \~1 hour zones 3-5 (combined) per week, 3 bodyweight resistance workouts per week (olympic ring pullups, dips, rows, pushups, core, and legs), about 10k steps per day walking.  I have an autoimmune disorder called anklylosing spondylitis but am otherwise healthy AFAIK.  I'm not on any medications but I take a vitamin D supplement.  (Vitamin D levels tested normal;  in fact all bloodwork tested normal within the last year).

Over the last year I've (purposefully) lost 35 lbs (185 -> 150), and have upped my exercise, but both my weight and my exercise have been pretty stable for at least 6 months or so.  I started a creatine supplement last week (doing \~3g per day, no loading phase).

Don't really have any obvious symptoms of low-T.  I get about 7.5 hours of decent sleep per night.  Pretty lean and muscular.  My sex-drive might be a little low but not egregiously so.  I do usually wake up twice per night to pee, but that's been happening for the past 20-30 years.  Don't really think the volume or intensity of my workouts is terribly high.  Diet is extremely clean, though perhaps I need to eat more and increase my weight and bodyfat.

Many thanks for any input!

 My whole life my family treated me condescendingly anytime they spoke to each other. It's like I wasn't really there Like an annoying fly on the wall. I wasn't allowed to be part of the social interaction and if I tried I was treated as if I was too dumb to be explained to or included in any way.

It's like I was always forgotten that I even existed.

So I was constantly trying to figure out WTF was going on in my family so I could be prepared because I wasn't allowed to see or use the family calendar. 

I quickly learned to try and be clean and ready and packed every day for anything.

They always used the fact that I was always out of the loop on everything to further prove that I must just be incredibly dumb. Like I was supposed to read their minds. Have known their plans weeks ago and been getting ready the past 3 days.

They're be getting ready for something and it was like pulling teeth to get them to tell me when where what was happening and if I'd be involved. 

And if I was I wasn't told until it was time to head out the door and then it was why aren't you ready? Why don't you know what's going on? Why are you always so stupid.

Then we would go and I would find out it's a 5 day trip to visit Grandma to a funeral and everyone was mad I hadn't packed what I needed. 

I wasn't allowed to have my own money I'd wallets or cards.

It would be an 8 hour drive there. I hadn't eaten breakfast. My parents never stopped to eat on the road and anything food prep sandwiches or whatever was always just for them. Not that I wasn't allowed to have some. It's just they made food only they would like and eat or like so I always was left eating the left over raw carrots and cucumbers and cellary sticks and told it was my fault that if I was truly hungry I would have eaten it.


 My mom always brought coffee or milk in a glass jar wrapped in newspaper to drink that was always Luke warm.

So we would get there and I wasn't allowed to go to the funeral because I hadn't packed the right clothes.  I was always left behind and STARVING. Already under weight. 

And they wouldn't eat anything until the next day and I would be so hungry I would chew on my thumbs raw on the main joint sucking the blood pretending they were chicken drum sticks all night so hungry I couldn't sleep.

I remember begging and crying and pleading for food on countless occasions and I was not allowed to help myself while they refused to provide me anything.

I can't tell you how many times I walked past that grocery store at the end no of their street fantasizing... About having money to buy my own food.

So now whenever we go anywhere I pack enough food medicine and medical supplies to survive 4 days on our own and it drives my husband crazy.

I reply with. But what if something happens? And my husband always remarks. We can grab something on the way. Nothing is going to happen.",8,1731608271.0,raisedbynarcissists,6,0.91,False

I am really confused and kind of feel like I’m an asshole. Here’s a story. I.(36f) became friends with T (60m) just a few months ago. We have mutual friends and frequent mutual establishments. T invited me to go on a bike ride up the canyon to watch this fall colors change. It was a beautiful ride and had lots of fun. Afterwards we continue to talk hang out and so forth. He expressed to me that he really likes me and wants a relationship with me. I tell him I am not ready to be any relationship with anybody nor am I ready to have sexual relations with anybody. But I do like him. He is a good friend and just want to be friends. We continue to me now and the more we hang out the more he starts to drop how much he wants to sleep with me that if I ever need a booty, call them to hit him up, that “I am a sexy young thing that he just wants to ravish, that he wants to spoil me and love me and just show me grand things that I’ve never seen before”. And I continue to tell him I am not ready for a relationship. I do not want a relationship and I am not going to sleep with him. Halloween he came over and I was making homemade chili for my children and him and I and my kids little friends as well. The whole time I was in the kitchen cooking he was making disgusting grunts and growls, and grabbing his cock literally. It got to the point where I turned around and I told him to stop enough is enough I’m disgusted. So he stopped. We pick up my children and come back to my place to eat dinner before trick-or-treating, and I tell him again in a very stern very straightforward, laying down the law that I will not sleep with him. I do not want to sleep with him and I do not want a relationship with him. He got upset, tried to hide it, which I respect because I didn’t want to hear his side anymore. I’m a woman and treat me with respect and dignity. A few days after I asked him if he is upset with me. And he answers yes that he is upset with me, but I will not sleep with him or have a relationship with him, but he says “I knew that he wouldn’t be good enough for me to falter on my decision and promises, I made to myself.” I didn’t mention above, but I am in recovery and I don’t want a relationship or have sex relationship with anybody until I’m a year clean. I’m trying to get my life straight and not use substances or sex to fulfill my life anymore. A week later or so we hang out and I tell him how that was very manipulative. Trying to guilt me into sleeping with him that I told him no one is good enough to fault her on my decision to put my recovery and my life first and how unfair it is to put that much pressure on somebody who is trying to do right in their life. He says “yes, that is very manipulative of me and I will probably manipulate you in the future. That’s just who I am at the core is one of my defects to the core I just don’t know if I can get rid of.” I told him how unfair that is and that if he wants to work on that he can and nobody likes to be manipulated. I did not talk to him for several days afterwards because who wants to be around someone who openly says I’m going to probably manipulate you even more than I have already And be OK with it. Yesterday we went had to head and he continues to tell me that he has done nothing wrong for me to lose trust in him that he has treated me with the most respect and not crossed any lines or boundaries with me and I am just being hypersensitive about this whole thing. I tell him how being manipulated and being told that he will probably manipulate me in the future loses a lot of trust I had for him that I don’t feel respected by him that I don’t have any value or worth other than I am a pretty face that he wants to sleep with. I tell him I’m not being hyper sensitive. I am hurt and I don’t trust that he won’t manipulate me again. Wake up this morning with a message saying how he doesn’t see how he’s in any wrong but he wants to come see me and let’s pick up a cup of coffee and talk while he drives me to work. but I am utterly disgusted by how he has treated me how he has minimized my feelings and refusal to see any part of my side and then blame me by saying I just being hyper sensitive about it and I just drop it and act like nothing‘s wrong. Nothing happened. So am I an asshole by just telling him I’m through being his friend that I don’t feel valued or have any worth in his eyes other than being a nasty doll to him?

And Mine Was Yesterday,"The town I live in is small and quiet, the kind of place where you know nearly everyone’s name and the sound of their voice. And here, where life moves slowly, and everyone’s path seems almost preordained, we have one custom that’s unlike any other- a certainty that’s part of our lives from the very beginning. From birth, each of us is given a date, printed on a small certificate and signed by the town’s doctor. It’s the date we’re expected to die.

Most of us accept it without question and treat it almost like a birthday or a local holiday- just a fact of life here in a town that values tradition and stability. That’s how it’s always been. You’re born, you live, and you prepare for that final day when it comes. Some people throw big “last day” parties or take farewell road trips; others, like me, keep things simple. The older you get, the more you find comfort in the routine and in the little things.

I’m Ethan, forty-five years old, and my own death date is tomorrow. It’s strange, perhaps, but I find myself calm about it, at peace even. I’ve had a good life here- a good job at the library, a small but loyal circle of friends, and a family who loves me. I’ve always known this day would come, and there’s an odd kind of relief in knowing it’s finally here. There’s nothing left I feel the need to do.

So tonight, the night before my death, I’m going through the motions with a quiet sort of dignity. I’ve spent time with my family, not wanting to make a fuss. I shared a simple dinner, passed around old family albums, and laughed over the usual stories. We toasted to a life well-lived, though I could see the glint of sadness in my sister’s eyes. I reassured her with a small smile and a touch on the shoulder. This is just how things are here. We don’t dwell on things; we don’t overthink them.

As the evening deepens, I find myself sitting alone in my room, boxing up sentimental odds and ends that had gone untouched for years: an old watch from my father, a few journals from my twenties, a dried bouquet from a high school dance. Each one is a part of a life that, in a way, feels complete now. There’s no sense of dread, just a sense of inevitability of a chapter drawing to a close as neatly as it began.

Outside, the town is settling down, the usual quiet settling in as people close up shop, dim their lights, and ready themselves for bed. I close my eyes and take a deep breath, a final moment of reflection on everything and nothing in particular. In this town, tomorrow, I think, will be just another day.

\-

I wake with a start, surprised to feel the morning light spilling across the bed. There’s a moment of disorientation as I lie there, still drowsy, half-expecting something else- an afterlife maybe, or even a simple void. Instead, I feel the solid weight of the mattress, the crisp sheets beneath my fingers, and the smell of coffee drifting faintly from the kitchen. It’s familiar, grounding, and yet... unexpected. I’m still here.

I sit up slowly, heart pounding as I look at the clock: 6:32 a.m. Then, my phone, just to confirm. The date... my death date, printed on my certificate since I was a child, has come and gone. But I’m still here, breathing, blinking in the daylight.

A wave of joy hits me, unbidden, like an electric surge. I’m alive. Somehow, I’ve outlived the date that was supposed to end my life. It feels miraculous, surreal- a “second chance”.

After pacing around in shock, I reach for my phone and dial my sister. I hesitate, thumb hovering over her name, unsure how to explain something I barely understand. But I finally press “call,” my voice thick with a mix of excitement and disbelief as I tell her the news.

At first, there’s silence on the other end. I hear her gasp, then a shaky laugh. She’s thrilled, but her voice has a hesitant edge, a hint of something I can’t place. “But Ethan… how?” she whispers, as if she’s afraid to ask. I don’t have an answer. I laugh, assuring her I don’t plan on looking a gift horse in the mouth. “Maybe it was just a mistake,” I say, though I can hear the doubt in my own voice.

My closest friends are equally baffled when I call them, their responses a strange mix of joy and unease. There’s a disconnect in their laughter, a sense of uncertainty. It’s as though I’ve broken a rule we’ve all lived by that has never been questioned. I can’t quite shake the feeling that their joy isn’t as genuine as I’d hoped.

That afternoon, still riding the wave of my own survival, I decided to step outside, eager to reconnect with the world. But as I walk through my yard, something peculiar happens. I reach out to steady myself on a nearby tree trunk, and the bark beneath my palm seems to lose its color, fading to a dull, lifeless gray. I pull my hand back, shaking off the odd sensation, telling myself it’s just a dead spot on the tree.

Later, I pick up my old watch- the one my father gave me, the one I’d packed away as a keepsake. The gold plating has somehow lost its shine, dulled and tarnished in a way it never was before. It strikes me as strange, but I laugh it off, attributing it to age.

Still, as I sit down to dinner, I can’t ignore a nagging feeling that something’s off. The food seems to taste a little bland as if it’s missing something. Objects around me seem to have lost their usual warmth, the color around me feeling subtly muted. But I brush it off, telling myself it’s just part of the adjustment.

After all, I’m alive. This second chance, whatever it is, is a gift, a miracle.

\-

After the initial shock of survival wears off, life takes on a new, vivid sharpness. I can feel the warmth of every sunrise like it’s painting my skin, scenes I took for granted before taking on a new meaning of hope. Each morning, I wake with a renewed energy, savoring everything I’d once taken for granted. I thought my time was up, and suddenly it wasn’t. So I dive in, determined to make the most of this uncharted time I’ve been given.

There are small things: walking the trails just outside of town, which I’d neglected over the years, and trying out recipes with an enthusiasm I never had before, experimenting with spices just because I can. And there are bigger things- I reach out to old friends I’d lost touch with, join a few local clubs, and catch up on every little dream that seemed out of reach. For once, I feel like a man let out of a cage. People around town notice, too, commenting on how I seem “brighter,” happier. And I am.

But the brightness fades. Occasionally, I begin feeling drained, nagging exhaustion creeping in, no matter how much I sleep. I’ll be mid-conversation with a friend and feel like my thoughts are molasses, as if I have to push my words out against a strong wind. My surroundings grow dim, colors appear just a shade darker, and the air is subtly colder. It’s subtle, like a shadow creeping just out of sight.

One evening, I headed to my sister’s house for dinner, excited to catch up. She’s set the table with flowers, all brightly colored and fresh- something she never does. But an hour into the meal, her face looks pale, a little drawn, and she keeps rubbing her temples, saying she feels unusually tired. The flowers seem to wilt during our meal, petals curling at the edges. She excuses herself early, and I leave, feeling unsettled. The next time I visit, she opens the door slowly, greeting me with a hesitant smile that doesn’t reach her eyes. She’s more distant, her conversation guarded. By the time I leave, I feel a chill in my bones, like I’ve walked out of a freezer.

The odd occurrences continue. Electronics around me short out, flickering, then dying in my hands. My old television set gives out with a loud pop one night, the screen going black. Then my microwave, the radio, even my alarm clock- all fail, one after the other. At first, I thought it was just bad luck, but when it happened to my phone, I couldn’t ignore it anymore.

People, too, start drifting away. Friends who were eager to spend time together grow quiet, canceling plans or cutting conversations short. They tell me they feel “off” or “uncomfortable,” fidgeting as if they can’t bear to stay near me. Even brief interactions leave them looking tired, distracted, and eager to leave. My sister stops inviting me over entirely, and when I call, her voice is distant, her words clipped.

One day, I ran into an old friend, Joe, at the grocery store. We chat for a few minutes, laughing over an old story, but by the end, he looks exhausted. There’s a pallor to his face, a sagging to his shoulders. He stammers something about needing to get going, and I watch him leave with a hollow feeling in my stomach.

Back home, things get stranger still. Food in my fridge spoils within days, and fruit and vegetables turn soft and foul-smelling even though they are well within their expiry date. I cook a meal, only to find it tasteless, no matter how well I prepare it. Even the water from my tap tastes stale and flat.

Sitting in my silent living room one evening, I feel a profound sense of isolation, a silence pressing in like a weight. The plants droop in their pots, the light flickers overhead, and a gnawing dread settles deep in my stomach. I’m still alive, yes, but something is deeply, unnervingly wrong.

As the days drag on, I start avoiding people, embarrassed and afraid of the effect I seem to have on them. My so-called second chance is becoming a curse, pushing everything and everyone away from me.

The weight of what’s happening settles over me slowly. I’ve gone over every possible explanation- stress, coincidence, my own paranoia. Still, I can’t ignore what’s right before me anymore. The flowers, the food, my friends... they’re all affected. Everything I come into contact with fades or dies, drained of its vitality.

One morning, as I stare at my reflection in the bathroom mirror, I notice something unsettling in my own eyes- a shadow, an emptiness. I look older, more haggard, and my skin is paler. For a moment, I feel like a stranger is staring back at me, someone unnatural, a distortion of the man I used to be. I’m surviving, yes, but at a cost I didn’t choose and don’t want to accept.

Desperate for clarity, I reach out to my closest friend, Tom. He’s been there through it all, steady and reliable, a grounding force I need now more than ever. When we meet, I can tell he’s hesitant, his usual ease replaced by an uncomfortable tension. Over coffee, I finally admit what’s been happening, each word feeling heavier than the last.

“Tom,” I say, voice tight, “have you noticed... anything strange since I... well, since I was supposed to...” The words trail off, and I watch his face carefully. To my relief, he doesn’t brush me off. Instead, he takes a deep breath, looking almost relieved to be asked.

“Honestly, Ethan, I have,” he says, pausing as if weighing his words. “It’s hard to explain, but I just... feel different after seeing you. Things don’t feel right. It’s like something’s off- like you’re off. Almost like you’re... out of sync with the rest of us.”

The words hit like a punch to the gut, and I can barely meet his gaze. But I couldn't help but appreciate his honesty. “So you’re saying...” I start, but he nods before I can finish.

“Yeah, Ethan, I don’t know how to say this, but it’s almost like you’re not supposed to be here.”

The silence between us is suffocating. I feel exposed like I’ve been laid bare. The last shred of denial crumbles, and I realize that somehow, surviving my death date has made me something unnatural. I'm living on borrowed time, but I didn't realize where I was borrowing it from.

Tom doesn’t say much more, but our discomfort grows palpable. He avoids my eyes, fidgeting with his hands, and finally, he stands, mumbling something about needing to leave. His face is filled with a mixture of pity and fear like he’s afraid I might take something more from him just by sitting here. He doesn’t look back when he leaves, and I know, deep down, that I’ve lost him. My oldest, closest friend.

As he walks away, I feel a hollowness settle in, gnawing and cold. I don’t just feel like an outcast- I am one.

Back at home, the isolation sets in. I’ve been given this “second chance,” but seemingly at the cost of everyone and everything around me. My presence has become toxic. Plants wither, my home feels more like a crypt than a sanctuary, and the silence presses in on me, heavier than ever.

Days pass, each one lonelier than the last. I avoid everyone- neighbors, friends, family, out of fear of what my presence might do to them. I don’t even open my windows, terrified of birds or stray animals, anything living that might come close enough to feel the drain. My house becomes a self-imposed prison, a quiet place where I exist in solitude, haunted by the life I’m unintentionally living.

What was once a miraculous second chance has become a slow, consuming curse. I’d once looked forward to each day, grateful for the unexpected time I’d been given. Now, I dread every moment, every step, every breath, wondering how much I’ll take from the world around me just by being here.

\-

The days blur together, every hour more suffocating than the last. I pace the length of my small house, fighting against the weight pressing in on me. I try to rationalize it. Maybe it’s a psychological trick, a dark corner of my mind manifesting this nightmare to punish me. But I know it's real each time I pass a mirror, catch the drawn hollows under my eyes, or feel the oppressive quiet hanging heavy around me. My presence is a poison, a drain on the life around me.

I can’t stay. I can’t keep letting this curse bleed into the people I once loved. In a flash of desperation, I decide to leave town and go as far as possible. Maybe distance will break whatever connection has turned me into this thing. I throw clothes into a bag, grab my keys, and shove open the door, practically running to my car.

But the escape doesn’t come easy. The car splutters to a stop barely two miles down the road, the engine wheezing and coughing before it dies completely. I sit there, slumped over the wheel, fighting the urge to scream. I call for a tow, waiting under the heavy sun as it drains the little energy I have left. But the driver who arrives seems put off. He barely looks at me as he fixes the car, muttering something about my “bad luck.” I brush it off, impatient, desperate.

The repairs hold just long enough for me to reach the edge of town. I feel a moment of relief as I see the highway stretch before me, endless, a way out of this nightmare. But as soon as I try to pull onto the road, the car shudders, lurches, and dies once again. It won’t start back up.

Defeated, I lock up and start walking, determined to leave on foot if necessary. Hitchhiking, however, proves impossible. Car after car whizzes, drivers looking at me with a strange mix of pity and unease, their eyes darting away when I catch their gaze. A bus pulls up at the stop near the edge of town, but the driver waves me off, barely glancing at me, muttering something about “not wanting trouble.” It’s like everyone knows, somehow, that I don’t belong.

Hours pass, and the hopelessness grows, gnawing at me like a festering wound. By evening, I’m back where I started, exhausted at the edge of town, every attempt blocked by either mechanical failure or the strange, unspoken refusal of others to help. It’s like an invisible force is binding me here, not with magic, but with sick twists of fate.

I stumble back to my house, shoulders slumped, every step feeling like a weight pulling me deeper into the earth. Inside, the silence greets me, heavy, hollow, and suffocating. It’s clearer than ever now: there is no leaving.

\-

I’ve exhausted every option, clinging to hope like a man drowning. But hope has abandoned me, leaving only questions- questions I’m done living with. So I go to the only person who might understand the impossible. The town’s Oracle is a quiet, reserved woman in her seventies, rumored to know secrets no one else dares speak of. She’s lived here as long as anyone can remember, her presence a fixture as familiar as the buildings themselves. People say she can see the threads of life and death, that she knows things about each of us that we could never know ourselves.

The air feels thick as I approach her home, the last place I can go for any sort of clarity. She answers the door before I even knock as if she is expecting me, and gestures for me to follow her inside. Her home is dim, filled with the smell of old books and faint incense. There’s a stillness here, something that feels eternal, as though time has no place in her world.

“Please,” I say, my voice cracking. “You have to help me. I need to understand... why did I survive? Why am I like this?” My desperation spills out in words that tumble over each other, jagged with raw need.

The Oracle regards me with a quiet, unreadable expression. She listens patiently, her eyes filled with a kind of ancient sadness, as though she’d heard every version of this plea before.

After a long silence, she speaks, her voice low and steady, almost like she’s speaking to herself. “Death dates are part of a balance here, Ethan. Each date holds a purpose, a thread in the fabric of life that keeps this town steady. To survive beyond that... it’s to unravel that balance. By living past your time, you’re pulling from the world around you, feeding on the life that’s meant for others. You’re not meant to be here.”

Her words are like a slow, cold current washing over me. “So... I am draining them?” I whisper, barely able to keep my voice steady.

She nods, her expression unwavering. “Yes. Every moment you remain, others in this town feel it. They lose pieces of themselves, pieces that go to sustain you. That is the price of escaping death: to live, you borrow. You’ve been borrowing from those around you, their vitality slowly siphoning into you.”

A sick realization settles in, chilling me to the bone. I’ve felt the fading light in my friends’ eyes, the way they’ve grown wary, distant. I was right to feel like a parasite, and this confirmation is a weight that threatens to crush me. I lower my head, unable to meet her gaze.

“Is there... any way to stop it?” I manage, the words barely more than a whisper.

The Oracle studies me carefully, then nods. “There is one way. But it requires surrender. The only way to end this, Ethan, is to restore what was taken, to give back the life you borrowed. You must accept your death as it was meant to be, willingly, to let the balance correct itself.”

The finality in her voice sinks deep. I’ve fought so hard to stay alive, clinging to each second, each breath. And now... now I’m being asked to let it go. I feel a strange calm settling in, resignation mingling with a heavy sorrow that tugs at my chest.

I nod, swallowing the lump in my throat. “I understand.”

She places a gentle hand on my shoulder, her touch warm and grounding, and hands me a vial of liquid. She didn't have to tell me what it was. “Take the time you need to say goodbye, Ethan. Then, when you’re ready, return to where you should have left.”

I leave her house feeling lighter yet burdened by a sadness that words can’t touch. This isn’t just an ending- now, it’s a choice, a sacrifice that holds more weight than anything I’ve ever known.

That night, I sat alone in my home, pen and paper in hand. I write letters to those I’ve loved, the friends I’ve lost. I don’t try to explain everything- how could I? Instead, I apologize and offer gratitude and love, hoping they’ll somehow understand the heart behind them. I write one to my sister, telling her I’m sorry for everything I took from her, for the shadow I brought into her life.

Each letter is a small act of surrender, a step toward letting go. When I finish, I seal the envelopes and leave them on the table, my last quiet gift to the life I’m finally ready to release.

I close my eyes, the silence around me feeling less like a prison and more like peace. I’m ready to restore the balance, to return what I’ve borrowed, and to embrace the end as it was meant to be.

\-

I stand at the threshold of my home, gazing over the town one last time. I break open the vial and gulp its contents. 

There’s a quietness now, a stillness in my mind that I haven’t felt since this whole nightmare began. As I step forward, the familiar streets seem to blur, fading into the first light of dawn. Each step draws something out of me, a gentle and final release. I feel the weight lift, like the burden I’ve carried is finally letting go, piece by piece.

The air grows lighter, as if the town is exhaling, filling with the life I’ve held captive in my skin. I keep walking, the drain growing deeper as I leave the last bounds of the town. I barely feel the ground beneath my feet, the final energy fragments slipping from me as I cross into open fields. My pulse slows, steady and calm, each beat softer than the last.

Around me, the world settles back to what it once was. The trees stand a little taller, the light grows a little brighter, and the quiet murmur of the town’s waking hours stirs to life behind me. The sense of presence I once drained from others feels restored and whole as if my departure was what the town needed all along.

I glance back, catching the faint outlines of familiar places, and I feel a wave of peace, knowing I’m leaving things as they were meant to be. Faces flash in my mind- my sister’s laughter, Tom’s quiet smile, the warmth of friends I held dear. They’re safe now, free from the pull of my unintended curse.

As my last breath fades, I know I’m no longer a part of this world but rather a quiet echo, something gentle in the background. I linger only as a whisper, a brief warmth felt by those I loved most, no more than a faint memory, a reminder that I was once here. And in this quiet surrender, I finally find peace, restored to the balance of things as they were always meant to be.",1,1731608086.0,CreepsMcPasta,0,1.0,False
1grb8kz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1grb8kz/dont_know_how_to_fix_this/,Dont know how to fix this ,"A month ago me and one of my roommates (lets call her cate) went to our neighbours house to get friendly. One of the girls and i didnt like each other to say the very least. Cate and my other roommate (dana) asked me if i was ok with them seeing our neighbours. I said ok. They've been going to their place for drinking and chatting ect while i go out with other friends. 

2 days ago dana and cate asked if i was cool having the neighbours over this weekend since i will not be home to see some friends out of town. I understood its not polite for them to keep going and never inviting them over. But i felt a like an outsider and left out so i was down that day and didnt join conversations. At night we sat down for some coffee and i decided to let it go and not bring this subject over. 

Today cate didnt really talk to me and ate alone in her room. I asked why she didnt join me and she said she needed to talk to me over something. When we sat down she said she felt that i disrespected her by shutting her down for a day and that she looked for a place to move out. I was puzzled and said i didnt mean it and i did so to bc i needed space to think it over. She said that she felt like a stranger in her house bc of me so she thinks our friendship is irreversably damaged. She thinks its unfair i got hurt when she always asked for my opinion. I didnt want to affect her friendship so i chose to keep quite. She said me moving out with them wasnt her plan at first and how she tolerates her room being the smallest when i have the biggest feels like she sacrificed her comfort for nothing. I just got up and left. 

I dont know what to do and feel incredibly betrayed. Dana says she feels like we are both right in our own way but i cant understand why me keeping to myself for a day has to responded with how im a burden and all my friendship with her is now amounts to nothing. What should i do? How should i handle this? All advice needed",1,1731608046.0,Advice,1,1.0,False
