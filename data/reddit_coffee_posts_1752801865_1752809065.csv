I'll share my complete guide on cleaning and descaling your Keurig, based on my personal experience.

First, let's talk about why cleaning matters. Over time, mineral deposits from water build up inside your Keurig, affecting both the taste of your coffee and the machine's performance. If you notice your coffee taking longer to brew or tasting off, it's probably time for a good clean.

Basic Daily Cleaning:
- Remove and wash the drip tray and K-cup holder
- Wipe down the exterior with a damp cloth
- Empty the water reservoir and rinse it thoroughly
- Clean the needle that punctures the K-cups (carefully!)

For deep cleaning and descaling (which you should do every 3-6 months):

1. Get a descaling solution. I always use Keurig's official descaling solution, but white vinegar works too.

2. Empty the water reservoir and remove any K-cups.

3. Fill the reservoir with equal parts descaling solution and water.

4. Place a large mug on the drip tray.

5. Run brew cycles until the ""add water"" light comes on, dumping the hot solution after each cycle.

6. Let the machine sit for 30 minutes.

7. Rinse the reservoir thoroughly and fill with fresh water.

8. Run at least 12 cleansing brews with fresh water.

If you're in the market for a new Keurig, I've found some great deals here: https://explorehomedeals.com/Keurig-coffee-makers. The newer models actually remind you when it's time to descale, which is super helpful.

Pro tips from my experience:
- Use filtered water to reduce mineral buildup
- Clean the needle monthly to prevent clogs
- Don't leave water in the reservoir overnight
- Consider using reusable K-cups to reduce waste

I recently upgraded my old Keurig to a newer model (found it at https://explorehomedeals.com/Keurig-coffee-makers), and the difference in coffee taste is remarkable when you maintain it properly.

Remember, regular maintenance prevents most common Keurig problems like slow brewing, incomplete cups, or strange-tasting coffee. It's worth taking the time to clean your machine properly - your morning coffee will thank you!

Let me know if you have any questions about the cleaning process. I'm always happy to help fellow coffee lovers keep their machines running smoothly.",1,1752808795.0,HomeHive,0,1.0,False

1m2rkrc,https://www.reddit.com/r/SustainableCapitalism/comments/1m2rkrc/you_can_thank_this_memo_for_reagan_billionaires/,"You Can Thank This Memo for Reagan, Billionaires, and Super PACs","**Who was Lewis Powell**: Former corporate lawyer from Big Tobacco, who unsuccessfully tried to argue that executives from PhillIp Morris were protected under their first amendment rights to lie to the public regarding how unsafe their products. What a guy! After that, he became a Supreme Court justice for 15 years - gross, but also relevant to where this vignette is going.

**Powell Memo, 1971:** He wrote a confidential letter (oops) to the US Chamber of Commerce titled Attack On America Free Enterprise. It's long and boring, but I cut and pasted a link to it below. In short: *Business is under attack by the media and by the working class, it's time to fight back by mobilizing corporations politically (buy politicians), infiltrate education and media, and to play the long game.*

**Post Powell memo, from 1971-1981:** PAC's (the less evil brother of SuperPAC's) were first created in the early 70',s and money started to flow heavily into the pockets of politicians from unelected officials. Mid to late 70's marked the birth of Think Tanks - Heritage Foundation, Cato Institute, and others started having influence and persuasion over the media and education. By the very late 80's (with Powell on Supreme Court) unions were beginning to lose power. There’s a lot more but Im trying to keep it somewhat brief.

**The Reagan Years:** In January of '81, Reagan was handed a 1000 Page document from The Heritage Foundation, titled Mandate for Leadership (essentially Powell Memo playbook) - it had ""over 2000"" recommendations in it to cut taxes for the wealthy, deregulate, take down unions - basically anything to help the top but hurt everyone else. Reagan adopted nearly ⅔ of these 2000 recommendations in his first 12 months in the White House. Reagan also gutted public schools, killed universal basic healthcare (google operation coffee cup), massively slashed corporate tax, and IMO the greatest offense of all: He allowed for a rule change with the SEC. Buybacks were now legal. So what, right? Well, they are a form of market manipulation and were illegal prior to Reagan. They are also a form of millionaire/billionaire socialism. That ""extra"" money used to go towards reinvestment, higher wages, and R&D. Now? It's a way for the CEO's and those with portfolios, to pay themselves and manipulate the market. In 2024, the total # of corporate buybacks hit just shy of $1 trillion dollars - but fuck you and your medical bills, am I right?

**This was all sold as Freedom and Progress!!! The opposite? Socialism!!! And we bought it up and still do today.**

So, if anyone wonders why so many more people could afford a home then, why kids were doing better than their parents, why we didn't have billionaires, why the wealth disparity wasn't nearly what we have today...its not really that hard to figure out. Or maybe I've turned into a conspiratorial nut...? Idk, never heard of this power memo up until about a week ago, and I've been deep down the rabbit hole ever since.

I'm not a socialist. I'm not anti getting rich.  I'm pro American, anti-partisan, and wish more people got a fair shake. What we had prior to Reagan was not socialism. It was Sustainable Capitalism, and unless we bring back some policies (or comparable) from that era and fast - we're going to continue to rot as a nation from the inside out.

Relationship of 2 and a half years. We felt a mutual love, we were moved by sharing details with each other, we loved each other and we planned for the future. 
The relationship was wearing down, like everyone else, but she suffered a lot. I went through a bad streak (at work, with negative energies), I stopped taking it as a priority and I accidentally neglected it.
She sought refuge in her best friend, with whom we shared plans together, she gained my trust. I trusted her a lot too.
They went running, studied together, had dinner. To me they were friends, there was no toxicity on their part. She is the typical good girl with values that can be trusted. 
Until…
They went on a trip together with another friend and when they returned she told me that she had feelings for him, and it was mutual. He was in a relationship too, and he automatically left her and she did the same with me.
From deductions I made while having coffee with her, I came to the conclusion that they have already had sex, they are in constant contact and she is still very firm in her decision not to return to me. Which shocked me a lot because for me it was sacred, it was mine and the fact that 2 weeks after cutting me I was already with him broke my heart.

The grief has already passed even though he is with me and I feel like I am dying.
Yesterday I blocked her, I feel like something was broken definitively and forever, although I am still very much in love with her and excited that a future will return. I really regret not having changed in time, if you are in a similar situation, try to do things differently, talk to her and take care of her environment.

It's a few hours drive so I had to smoke them ahead of time. I called the local butcher shop yesterday and asked if they could have 4 racks of ribs ready for me as I'd be there right before closing time as they closed about 5 minutes after I'd be able to get there. The lady on the phone asked how big I wanted them and I said, ""I don't know, full racks?"" and she didn't ask any more questions. 
I ended up with 50lbs of ribs. Two whole pigs worth. 4 racks. I froze most and threw the rest on my little Pit Boss.

I put a coffee rub on three racks and a Kbbq inspired rub on the 4th. I was a little concerned with the size of them so I just did the standard 3-2-1 method with whatever brand of pellets my wife picked up last time she was at Costco and hoped for the best. I spritzed the rub with apple cider vinegar until it was damp before placing the ribs in the smoker, spritzed them again when I wrapped them and then basted the ribs with the collected juices after I unwrapped them and let them sit for the last hour. Then I let them rest for an hour and then sliced off one each for  wife and I to sample in case I screwed things up. They turned out pretty dang good and I get to feel like a proper caveman this weekend. I think it might be my best smoke ring yet. ",5,1752808460.0,pelletgrills,1,1.0,False

I moved to her city (Vienna) partly because of her, but she consistently sees me as a friend despite our history. Last tried asking her out on Valentine’s Day - got a gentle but clear “no.” Five months later, wondering if I should move on or if there’s still hope.

-----

The full story:

Two years ago, I (let’s say mid-20s) met this girl during a solo trip to Scotland. We connected at a hostel pub crawl - I literally asked her point blank “Do you want to get married? Do you want kids?” She said yes to both. We talked all night, made out, hooked up in the hostel bathroom. The next morning, she had vanished like something out of a movie - already left the city.

But I was hooked. We talked every day for a month, hours-long phone calls. She eventually invited me to visit her in Vienna. I went, and we had what felt like four magical days together. But it was too intense, too fast. She got scared by how quickly emotions were developing, especially with us living in different countries.

We tried to make it work long distance but it fell apart. A few months later she sent me a random picture of Vienna. I thought it was a sign to reconnect - it wasn’t. I kept initiating conversations until I finally asked “What went wrong between us?” She said she wasn’t “sure” and it wasn’t “mathematical” to explain what happened.

Plot twist: Six months later, I moved to Vienna. Partially because of her, but also because I genuinely loved the city. I didn’t tell her I was moving, but she texted me two weeks after I arrived. We met at the same café we’d been to a year earlier.

She was radiant - I told her her “aura was yellow” (yeah, I actually said that). But I had to tell her I was seeing someone new in Vienna. She mentioned wanting to leave Vienna, which visibly hurt me. We ended on a good note but didn’t talk for five months.

Valentine’s Day 2025: I reached out for coffee. It turned into pool and too many beers. I could feel the old chemistry, caught myself staring at her. When I offered to walk her to her bus stop, she seemed hesitant - like she was worried I might try something. I didn’t.

Got home and texted her immediately: thanked her for the evening, said I’d like to see her again but as a date this time. Added that we could always just be friends if she wasn’t interested romantically.

Her response: “Thank you too, it was really fun!!! But I have to say no to a date.. you might have noticed that I’m not really in the mindset to date. And for me I enjoy having you as a friend, I would not want to change that..”

I handled it well, accepted it gracefully. We’ve barely talked since then - just occasional light exchanges.

Now (5 months later): I don’t even know if she’s still in Vienna or followed through on her plans to move. Part of me wonders if I should reach out one more time, but another part thinks I should finally let this go.

Questions for Reddit:

- Is this a case of “right person, wrong time” or am I just not seeing that she’s simply not that into me romantically?
- Should I try reaching out as friends one more time, or is that just prolonging the inevitable?
- How do you know when to stop fighting for someone who clearly means a lot to you?

I’ve never felt a connection like this with anyone else, but I’m also tired of this two-year cycle of connection and retreat. What would you do?

The overall index, excluding fresh food, has been positive for 46 consecutive months, though its growth rate has shrunk for the first time in four months.

So I’m only 25, but I got an internship in an industry I wasn’t even really interested in on a whim when I was in college and busted my ass to get really good at the job (worked full time in addition to being a full time student) and have been able to fast track my way to a senior-level role at the firm I’m at now. 

I understand I should be grateful and proud of myself for getting here so fast. But I’m so fucking burned out. I get messages from clients and from my boss constantly. Does not matter what time it is. I get emails and messages from clients when I am literally asleep (that is, when I can fall asleep… I can hardly sleep these days due to stress and when I can fall asleep, I keep waking up at 3am and being unable to fall back asleep) regularly. 

My client load is well above industry norms. Overtime pay does not exist here. The firm I work for now has been in startup mode since I got here, and they’re doing well, but there’s still a constant sense of instability. My role has undergone major shifts every few months over the last year, more work is added to my plate what seems like every few weeks, and I’m constantly training new people, some of whom don’t last longer than a few months. 

There have been a couple times in the last few months I’ve suddenly had a full-blown anxiety attack while talking to a client… as in my voice starts noticeably shaking, heart starts pounding, vision goes blurry. I’m a fairly seasoned public speaker and that hasn’t happened to me since I was 15 years old (definitely hasn’t happened in all my years of interfacing with clients up to this point). I can feel myself physically crumbling under the pressure. 

I don’t feel like this is worth me having no life. I haven’t worked out in three weeks because I’m so freaking tired after work that all I do is just rot on the couch and play video games, and I’ve lost five pounds during that time because I’m incredibly stressed and I hardly have time or energy to eat(on top of the 70 pounds I’ve lost in the last year… some of it intentional, some of it not). I basically live on coffee and nicotine. I’ve been with my partner for a long time and we’re getting to the point where we should be thinking about our future and settling down, but I could never have a wedding, much less have a freaking kid when work consumes my life to this degree. 

I’ve been applying to jobs aggressively for the last two months and am in early stages of interviewing for one job but haven’t heard back from anyone else, which I feel is probably a combination of a) me being young and only having a total of 5 years of experience despite having a senior-level title and b) my experience being pretty niche. The job I’m interviewing for wouldn’t even be a step up pay wise, but at this point I don’t even care. 

I also can’t just up and quit just to take a break because the majority of my income goes toward student loans and living expenses, so I have no savings and really don’t want to have to ask my partner to help me cover living expenses because I can’t pull my weight. I also know my current firm would be totally fucked if I left, which I can’t help but feel guilty about… it’s just who I am. 

I’m literally torn between having job/financial security and not being completely miserable and I hate it. I regret so many of the decisions I’ve made up to this point. I shouldn’t have gone to a school that required me to take out loans. I shouldn’t have become the person who says yes to everything. I should have worked harder to hold onto who I was outside of this job. I feel like crying all day every day and it makes me feel like a failure even though I’m doing a fine job.

She was radiant - I told her her “aura was yellow” (yeah, I actually said that). But I had to tell her I was seeing someone new in Vienna. She mentioned wanting to leave Vienna, which visibly hurt me. We ended on a good note but didn’t talk for five months.

Valentine’s Day 2025: I reached out for coffee. It turned into pool and too many beers. I could feel the old chemistry, caught myself staring at her. When I offered to walk her to her bus stop, she seemed hesitant - like she was worried I might try something. I didn’t.

Got home and texted her immediately: thanked her for the evening, said I’d like to see her again but as a date this time. Added that we could always just be friends if she wasn’t interested romantically.

Her response: “Thank you too, it was really fun!!! But I have to say no to a date.. you might have noticed that I’m not really in the mindset to date. And for me I enjoy having you as a friend, I would not want to change that..”

I handled it well, accepted it gracefully. We’ve barely talked since then - just occasional light exchanges.

Now (5 months later): I don’t even know if she’s still in Vienna or followed through on her plans to move. Part of me wonders if I should reach out one more time, but another part thinks I should finally let this go.

Questions for Reddit:

- Is this a case of “right person, wrong time” or am I just not seeing that she’s simply not that into me romantically?
- Should I try reaching out as friends one more time, or is that just prolonging the inevitable?
- How do you know when to stop fighting for someone who clearly means a lot to you?

I’ve never felt a connection like this with anyone else, but I’m also tired of this two-year cycle of connection and retreat. What would you do?",1,1752807747.0,relationships,1,1.0,False
1m2r9kz,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1m2r9kz/recommended_calories_for_insulinresistant_pcos/,Recommended calories for insulin-resistant PCOS ?,"Hi everyone! 

I'd love to have your feedback on calorie intake with PCOS (insulin resistant type). 

I'm 29, fairly active these past few months (yoga, pilates, 4-6km regular walks, gym and tennis) and on the pill (planning to get off in the next few months and try to conceive in the next year). I've been using AI to help me track my macros to ensure I hit my protein/carbs/fat/fiber goals for muscle gain, hormone stability and long-term fertility. 

It's come to my attention that although I've been hitting my macros, my calorie intake should be way higher. In order to attain my goals and macros, while being in a light deficit to lose some fat (I'm 62kg), I should be having 1900-2000 calories daily. And the safest low calorie intake would be 1700. However, on a typical day where I eat at home it's around 1200-1400 (which includes 3 meals a day, a sweet treat and a coffee). 

I definitely eat on the lower calorie side and high volume, and could try to increase my intake with some tweaks but I'm a bit skeptical about having to reach 1900-2000 calories daily. It seems like a lot and counter-intuitive if I'm still hitting my macros. This is all new to me, and AI can get overwhelming. 

Do any of you have experience with tracking your calories and macros, and having a diet that sustained similar objectives as mine? If so, I'd love to know the calorie intake you suggest and maybe some recipes/food combinations that have worked for your PCOS. 

Thank you in advance :)",1,1752807744.0,PCOS,1,1.0,False

ONE.

My fascination with ghosts and the paranormal began 2 years ago. It was a cool summer night, and it was beginning to rain. Me and my friends, Dan and Todd, were walking back home from a ‘night on the town’, which isn't saying much as we live in a small Minnesota town with a population of 1,400 people.

 We were walking down Roosevelt street, despite Dan's protest. He hated taking this path home because of the decaying school that sat dormant on this street. Rumor around town was that the school is haunted. People say they have heard screaming and wailing from the school at night, but Todd says it's all bullshit.

It's a large modern brick building standing 2 floors tall and takes up the entire block. It was once a nice up-to-date school, but it closed down a couple years prior due to a dwindling student population. A year later it was bought by an old mechanic in town, and he intended to renovate it into a hotel, but the city said the school was on the verge of being condemned due to the west wing's second floor being on the verge of collapse. So now it sits nearly empty, the mechanic Charlie lives alone in the school and works out of the old auto shop room, so his investment wouldn’t be a complete waste. Charlie denies the claims of the school being haunted. 

As we walked closer to the school Dan and Todd were arguing about how ‘haunted’ the school was.

“I just don’t see why we couldn’t take a different route home”  Dan said “this area gives me the heebie jeebies” 

“This is the fastest route home, and I'm not trying to get caught in the rain” Todd replied

“It's just a bunch of small town gossip is all, this town has nothing else going on so they make things up to stay interesting” 

“I went here when I was a kid,” I added. “There's nothing scary about it. The closest occurrence we had was me almost dying of boredom a couple times.” 

“Yeah yeah very funny” Dan sighed “My brother said he refuses to step foot on this street after what he heard one night”

“Okay, but your brother is also a drunk, so who knows what he actually heard.” said Todd. 

As Dan and Todd continued bickering about how scary the school was, I heard a faint tapping sound coming from nearby. I stopped dead in my tracks, it sounded like a hand tapping on glass. 

“Guys shut up for a sec” I said “Do you hear that?”  

They slowed to a stop, and I realized the sound was coming from the direction of the school. The tapping sound became louder as if someone was beating on a window. I didn’t see anything at first, but as I looked closer into the school I saw the outline of a girl in one of the lower windows. 

“There! In-in the West Wing! Theres a- there's a girl in the window on the bottom floor!” I stammered as I grabbed my phone from my pocket. 

“Which window?” Todd asked “there's a lot of windows dude” 

“Oh Shit, there! I see her!” Dan yelled

I opened the camera on my phone to try record a video, but before I could I heard a piercing scream and I dropped my phone. 

I bent down and picked my phone up off the ground, when I looked back up she was gone. 

“Where'd she go?!” I asked frantically

“She dropped below the window” Dan responded “I don't see her anymore!” 

I continued looking around but Dan was right, she was gone. 

“Dammit” I exclaimed “I should have got that on video!” 

“I didn’t see anything” Todd stated “are you sure you saw a girl? That screech could have been anything.” 

“Yes dude, I'm sure! That was the scariest moment of my life. Now I'm ready to get the hell out of here, let’s go” Dan said, while picking up the pace back towards home. 

“Wait, shouldn't we find out what the hell that was?” I asked 

“How? Its private property?” Asked Todd “if you want to call the cops and tell them you saw a ghost girl in the school you can go right ahead, but I'm going to join Dan and get out of here, it's starting to rain” As he turned to catch up with Dan.

I cursed under my breath again, upset that I messed up what would have been the best ghost evidence on the internet. I took one more look at the school before turning around to join my friends. 

TWO.

That moment sparked my inspiration to start a youtube channel, so Todd, Dan, and I launched a channel a few months after, we named it the MidwestGhostHunters. We have been on a dozen hunts by now, with little to no evidence to show for it, but we have amassed 60k subscribers. 

The closest thing we have to evidence is a door closing on its own during our investigation of an abandoned mall. Todd is adamant that it was a draft, but Dan argues it was definitely something paranormal and that Todd is ignorant. Other than that though, all we have caught are some loud creaks and bangs while investigating abandoned houses, which I realize can easily be brushed off as nothing.

I am certain that our big break would be if we could investigate the school. Ever since word of our channel got around town, people have told me many stories regarding that building, and they insist that’s what we should investigate next. I've already tried asking the owner Charlie if I could, he said he would if he could but his insurance doesn’t want anyone else going in that building and that they are already opposed to him living there as is. So for now I have just been recording the neighborhoods stories to hopefully make into a video later. 

THREE.

I woke up this morning to my phone ringing. I rolled over disgruntledly to see Todd calling.

“What do you want?” I answered a bit harshly. 

“Well good morning to you too, Sunshine” Todd responded

“Well excuse me, It is 8am on a Saturday, what is so important that it couldn't have been a text?” I asked 

“Well, I call with good news” Todd said 

“Okay, well, what is it then” I replied curiously

“Charlie died” Todd stated a bit too excitedly 

I paused before asking “How is this good news Todd?” 

“Well it's not, but it's good for us at least. Because this means we can finally investigate the school,” he replied.

I took a moment, thinking it over, unsure what to say. I had only woken up moments ago, and now I'm being told Charlie is dead and that we should investigate his school. 

Todd added “Abby just told me. His body is going to the coroner's office this morning. An officer found his car wrapped around a tree, they suspect it happened last night.” 

Todd's wife Abby works for the city, so of course she has the inside scoop.

“There’s a slight hitch though,” Todd added. 

“What's that?” I asked 

“Well Abby tried to notify the next of kin, but all that he had listed was some guy down in Oklahoma. She told him the news, and he told her that he would be coming up in a couple days and that he is going to buy the school when he gets there.” Todd said. 

“That's odd” I added “he has quite the list of priorities I guess. What would he want with a condemned school anyways?”  

“I was wondering the same thing” Todd said “but regardless that means we would have to investigate it soon, before the buyer gets into town.” 

Todd was right, we could investigate the school now that Charlie is dead. It probably isn’t very considerate but it's a possibility nonetheless, and we wouldn't get another possibility like this again. 

“Okay, I’ll tell Dan,” I said finally “we will investigate the school tonight” 

FOUR.

It was well after dark as we approached the school. It's even more ominous when we are this close, especially when it is bathed in the night. The building looks weathered yet surprisingly current, and besides for the paint flaking and fading away, it looks just as I remember it from when I was a student. We crossed the empty parking lot and as we got to the front doors Todd spoke first “Sooo do we just walk in through the front door, or did anyone make a plan for how we get inside?” 

I looked over to Dan and he gave me a small shrug as a response. 

I responded “I guess I didn't consider that part. I put too much thought into whether or not we should and didn’t think about if we even could.” 

Dan let out a light chuckle saying “I was more worried about if it's more or less illegal to break into a man's house after he is dead. Is it still breaking and entering if he is dead, or is this just trespassing?” 

“I'm no lawyer, and I'm barely a ghost hunter, but from a legal standpoint, i'm gonna say maybe” I joked

“Well he did say he would be okay with it if it weren't for his insurance” Todd replied “who would we sue now if we got hurt?”

“Okay, that's a reasonable point I suppose” I said trying to make myself feel better about this potential crime “but we better figure out a way inside here soon, I don’t want any cops to see us. Anyone have any ideas?” 

Todd bent over and grabbed a large rock. 

“No, put that down dude” Dan said in a hushed shout “That would definitely be breaking and entering” 

“Well, do you have a better idea?” Todd asked

As Todd and Dan squabble about the most acceptable way to break into the school, I approached the front doors. I put my hands on the doors and gave it a little push, and to our surprise they actually opened. 

“He left them unlocked?” Asked Dan

“I guess” I responded “it is a small town after all, maybe he didn't plan to be out for long.” 

Todd and Dan entered the building behind me. The doors closed behind us and we could hear the sound echo throughout the vast building. We turned on our shoulder lights, the school still has power running to it, but we don’t want any neighbors to see the lights on.

The school has an odd aesthetic to it since it is now redesigned to be a home. We stood in the entryway which is a large open hallway now designed as a very open living room. There were a few display cases along the nearest wall that now holds Charlie's shoes and coats. The room has a few couches and an older TV, neither of them seemed to be used in a while. 

“You guys ready?” I asked as I pulled out the camera. 

“Yes, but please don't do your regular intro for our video” Todd pleaded

“Why not? I've done it for every video” I asked

“Dude, it's annoyingly stereotypical. If this video does blow up our channel like you say it will, we can't have that type of introduction for the new viewers” Todd stated

“Okay well do you want to do the introduction then?” I asked him. 

“Well no, that'd be even worse” he said

“Okay then. I’ll do the introduction my way then.” I stated

I turned the camera around to face me and hit record. “Good evening Midwest Ghost Viewers, we are back again with another investigative video. Tonight we are investigating my local school. This building is a bit of a local legend, there are so many terrifying stories about this place, so we just had to investigate it. So get ready to start believing in the paranormal, but before you do, don’t forget to like and subscribe.” 

I hit pause on the camera, and it  was followed by a deafening silence in the room. I could see Todd and Dan holding back laughter. 

“I agree with Todd, that shit sounds pathetic dude” Dan laughed finally

“Yeah I know” I said “It always does.” 

“That one hurt,” Todd chuckled while shaking his head. “Can we go explore now with that out of the way?” 

“Yes please” I said dejectedly 

To the right of the now living room is the gymnasium, and to the left is the swimming pool, we elected to explore the gymnasium first. 

The gymnasium didn’t appear to be altered at all, it also didn’t appear to have been used lately, the bleachers are dusty and the floor looks as if it hadn’t been swept in at least a year. 

I pulled out my camera to record some footage while we performed our tests. Our investigation usually starts with an ouija board, most ghost hunters claim this is complete BS, and honestly we agree, but it does provide some good content. We didn't get much if any movement from the board this time, besides for Todd trying to spell out P-E-N-I-S a couple times. The next test we like to try is the spirit box, Todd absolutely hates this device, and I can see why, but Dan is convinced it is legit. We let the spirit box run for a while. Dan said he heard some related words, but I think he was really stretching his imagination, because all I heard was incoherent nonsense. I usually check an EMF reader while we investigate, but it was very unreliable tonight due to the building actually having power for once. And speaking of power, the air conditioner scared the hell out of us a couple times during the testing. We are used to it being dead silent and we fine tune our ears to pick up any noises, so when the AC roared to life we all jumped.

Once we agreed we weren’t getting any evidence in this area we walked across the hall to the swimming pool. The room is humid and smells like chlorine despite the 12 foot pool being drained. The hot tub had a couple renovations from the last time I had seen it, there is now a TV mounted nearby and a new minifridge sitting adjacent. We ran a few tests in this room as well, with no proof yet again. 

We wandered over to the locker rooms which are just outside of the swimming area. We entered the men's room, and it appeared to be well used. I assume this was Charlie's main bathing area based off of the fresh towels sitting in the lockers and dirty laundry sitting in a hamper in the corner. The sink has a couple of new drawers built on to it, with his toiletries sitting on top. We didn’t stay in here for long or record any video, as it felt invasive even though he was gone. 

I stepped back into the hall and took an awkward glance into the women's locker room. 

“Hey bud, what ya looking at?” Dan asked, ""Is this how I find out you are a pervert?”

“I'm just curious, haven’t you wondered what a women's locker room is like?” I asked 

“Sure, but it’s probably the same as the men's just without the urinals, and maybe different paint” Todd stated

“Okay well don't you guys wanna find out, now is our chance” I said 

“Sure I suppose, why not?  Let's go peep in the girls bathroom” Todd said while walking in. 

When we entered the locker room we were surprised and speechless from what we saw. The women's room also appears to be well used, but by girls, which was concerning because Charlie didn't have a wife nor kids. The lockers contained towels and girls' clothing, ranging from children's size to adult. The doors on the stalls were removed. 

Todd broke the silence by saying “What- the- fuck. Are you guys disturbed by this as well” 

“This is definitely concerning, this doesn't make any sense” I replied

“Why would Charlie have girls' clothes here, and why so much? It’s just him that lives here.” Todd asked 

Before I had a chance to reply Dan shushed us. His eyes wide with fear, and stammered “I think I just heard someone knocking” 

“As in? Knocking how” Todd asked still focused on the locker room

“Like when you knock on somebody's front door politely waiting to be let inside” Dan said 

“Could it have been old pipes maybe?” Todd asked still looking around the locker room

“No, it definitely sounded like a hand knocking on a door. As in knock knock, who's there” Dan said “I'm telling you guys-”

Knock,Knock,Knock

He was interrupted by the knocking, it must have been louder this time as Todd and I both heard it clearly. Dan was right it definitely sounded like someone knocking on a door, even Todd looked like he agreed. 

I turned my camera on and we stepped back into the hall. 

I asked “is it coming from the front door? Did someone find out we are here?” 

“Maybe,” Dan said “it's so hard to tell, the building echoes so much” 

I started cautiously walking to the front door when we heard it again. 

Knock,Knock,Knock

“That sounded like it came from down the hall” Todd stated 

“That leads deeper into the school, that's the hall that brings you to either the West or East wings” I said

“Well I don't like that,” Dan said as the three of us began walking down the hall. The hall felt as if it was a mile long, and it felt like I was running one based on how hard my heart was beating. I'm excited that this will be the first bit of actual evidence we have ever gotten, but I am also terrified.

 We finally got to the end of the hall, there are two sets of double doors on either side of the hall. The right set of doors are open, they lead into the East wing which is the high school, assumedly where Charlie used to live. The left doors are chained shut, they lead into the west wing which is the elementary school, that is the condemned wing so that's probably why they are chained shut. 

“Which way do you think it came from” Todd asked

We got our answer as we heard another Knock,Knock,Knock to the left and I saw the west wing doors shake and bind against the chains. 

I slowly approached the doors and asked “Hello, who is it?” with false confidence. In response we heard a quick pattering fleeing from the door, like little footsteps running away in a game of tag.

We sat in silence for a moment, my confidence quickly fading.  

Dan pushed on the doors and said “we have to get into the west wing, there is clearly something back there. Do you think Charlie left a key somewhere” while he pulled on the lock.

“Maybe” I replied “but actually the East and West wings share a lunch room, so the two sides meet up again at the cafeteria, maybe those doors are less secure and easier to break into.” 

“Well let's take a trip through the east wing then” Todd said “before that critter gets away.”

We all shared a look of agreement, and headed through the high school doors.

FIVE

The high school appears to be more taken care of, the carpet looks recently vacuumed and the walls have been repainted. We walk through the vacant halls, passing by empty class rooms. I recorded some more with the camera, while Dan and Todd were bickering yet again.

Dan said “there is no way you actually think that was an animal back there” 

“It had to be” Todd responded “what else could it be? A ghost? A ghoul? Some sort of monster maybe?” 

“We are GHOST hunting, so yes I do think it could be a ghost. That is the whole reason we are out here, that's what we are trying to find” Dan stated

Todd stayed quiet, probably because Dan has a pretty good point.

“What kind of animal do you think it was then?” Dan asked half jokingly 

“I don't know, that's why we are going over there. It has to be something pretty big though.” Todd said unconvincingly

“Oh come on dude, seriously? Do you hear yourself right now” Dan asked

We passed by the auto shop, it lay empty which seems odd to me. The shop hasn’t changed much, besides for the addition of Charlie's tools. The room is fairly dusty, but it's hard to tell if that's out of the ordinary for auto shops. The attached classroom is renovated into an office space. A newer computer sits atop his desk with a few file cabinets sitting along the nearby wall. We searched the office for his keys, but we found nothing, so we kept heading for the cafeteria.  

I led us through the next corridor, and through a shortcut through the library. It has been remodeled into an oversized living room area. A couple couches and a reclining chair sat around a large TV with a nice sound system. A couple of the bookshelves now hold an extensive collection of movies and CDs. We planned to come back to this room and investigate it further after we checked out the west wing. 

We took a quick detour to explore the principals’ office which is now Charlie's bedroom. The layout reminds me of a small apartment, there's a waiting room when you first walk in, which connects to Charlie's bedroom and main bathroom. It is well decorated, the waiting area has a couple plants sitting in the corners of the room and the walls are arranged with posters of old metal bands I don't recognize. His bedroom is also well kept, the bed is made and his nightstand seems organized. We searched this area as well, but did not have any more luck finding the keys. I was beginning to worry that he may have had the keys on him the night he died, but I tried to push that thought away as we continued our expedition to the cafeteria. 

We finally arrived at the cafeteria, it is a spacious room lined with rows of long tables. I looked closer at the tables and saw something that troubled me. There are about a dozen lunch trays loaded with food sitting on a couple of the tables. The food looks to be only a day or two old. I point it out to the guys, and Todd seems equally troubled by it. We were confused about why Charlie would need so many trays for himself, but Dan walked by us clearly more interested in the doors that connect to the West Wing, expressing a bravery we haven’t seen from him before. He stepped up to the doors and gave them a push, they are locked, so he took a couple steps back and before either Todd or I can protest he kicks the doors open. 

We caught up to Dan and I said “Y’know a heads up would have been nice”

Dan replied “Well we couldn't find the keys and I don’t know of any other ways in, so how else were we going to get into the elementary school?”

Todd said “I don't know dude, you didn't really give us any time to weigh our options.” 

“Okay well it's too late now, so why are we wasting time debating how to get through the doors when I've already kicked them down.” Dan asked smugly 

“Okay fair enough, you make a good point. Let's go then.” Todd said, leading the way into the elementary school. 

Before following them, I record a quick extra bit of footage of the cafeteria, still troubled by the lunch trays. Eventually I turn back towards my friends, hurriedly closing the gap into the West Wing. 

SIX.

The West Wing is more neglected, but still holds the appearance of an elementary school. Most of the rooms still have the old desks and classroom decor, but are covered in a heavy layer of dust. This side of the school smells musty and stale. All of the windows on this side are boarded up. The walls are painted pastel colors and the floors have colored lines which lead to different portions of the school. We saw no obvious signs of what was knocking on the door earlier, so we decided we should walk back to the first set of doors, in hopes that we might find something closer to where the knocking first occurred. 

As we got deeper into the elementary school, I noticed something. The West Wing is in very nice condition, it looks clearly abandoned, but it didn't appear to be on the verge of collapse like Charlie said it was. I mentioned it to the guys. 

“Hey, does this wing look very condemned to you two?” 

They paused to look around, Todd said ""I'm no building inspector, but I would agree, this wing does look pretty nice so far, I wouldn't condemn it.” 

Dan commented “I thought Charlie said it was the second floor that was dangerous, we haven't made it up there yet.” 

“I guess” I said “but I assumed there would be damage on the first floor as well, if the second floor was about to collapse.”  

They just shrugged and continued exploring.  

As we traipsed past the computer lab, Dan stopped us silently raising a hand. 

“What's up? Why are you acting all black ops right now?” Todd whispered

“Do you hear that?” Dan asked “do you hear that humming?” 

We fell silent and I heard it. It's a sing-songy type of humming coming from within the computer lab. We exchange nervous glances, and I lead the way slowly prowling into the room. The lab has numerous computers lining every wall and a couple rows down the middle. I can hear the humming clearer now that we are inside, but I can't quite make out the song. We can’t see the source of the humming right away, so we split up to get a better look.

 I slowly approach one of the middle rows. I apprehensively looked under the desks, and I discover what is singing. A young girl is crouched under the desk on the far end. She's wearing a dirty stained nightgown and her hair is matted. She is rocking back and forth slowly, and I can now hear her whimpering “they need help” as she hums. I froze, unsure how to proceed. She must have felt my eyes on her because she quit humming and sits still. Slowly she turns her head to look at me. She looks me dead in the eyes unblinking, and lets out an ear piercing raspy shriek. I jump back terrified and she leaps at me. I narrowly avoid her, but I somehow manage to drop the camera as she runs by me and towards the door. She ran into the hall screaming, “YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE!” and “GET OUT!” 

I look back at the guys, they both sit petrified. 

“Guys! Snap out of it, we gotta follow her” I yell while picking up my camera off the floor. Thankfully it still works. Dan rushed to my side and we ran into the hall in the direction the girl fled.

We rounded the corner at the end of the corridor and see the girl standing completely still with her hand pointing towards the stairs. I stop and pull out my camera, recording clear footage of the girl. 

She whispers “they are up there, please help us.” 

Dan said “fuck this dude, im out. We got our footage, that's enough for me.” and turns around racing towards the nearest exit.

“Dan! Wait!” I yell pleading 

I turn back towards the girl, but she’s gone. Nervously I look around for her, I see fresh footprints in the dust that lead upstairs, but I'm not about to go up there alone.

“Yeah fuck this” I agree and run back the same way as Dan. 

I found Dan and Todd back in the computer lab. Todd shook out of his horror, but he was still spooked. I approached him saying “It's time to go buddy. I got our footage, let's leave”. Dan nodded in anxious agreement, leading us out the door.

We quickly retrace our steps back to the cafeteria. I am a bit concerned about Todd, I've never seen him this quiet before, but Dan is able to escort him out ahead of me. 

We made it back to the cafeteria without event. I turned back momentarily to close the doors behind us, then we paused briefly to catch our breath. 

“What the hell was that?” Dan asked, still rattled.

“I think that was our first ghost,” I said excitedly.

“Once we get out of here I can't wait to say I told you so” Dan said playfully pushing Todd

Todd laughed anxiously “yeah, I guess you guys are right. I think that was actually a ghost. Did you get it on camera?” 

“Oh yeah I did. This video is gonna blow us up. The footage I got is perfect, I’d dare to say the best evidence on the entire internet” I responded

“You guys ready to go home so we can get that footage posted then?” Dan asked 

“Yes I am very ready to get the hell out of here” Todd said.

We headed back the way we came, following our footsteps through the highschool, through the once home of old Charlie. I still have a lot of questions after this expedition, but for now I'm focusing on getting home. 

We made it through the high school easily, and got back to the hallway that divides the west and east wings. I let out a sigh of relief as I saw the entryway doors at the end of the hall. I took a moment near the West doors to look at the chains, when the door slowly creaked open and rattled as it bound against the chains. A face now peering at us through the gap. As soon as I locked eyes with her, the doors began to violently shake, and I heard a girl's voice yelling and crying “LET US OUT, PLEASE. Please, you have to set us free. Help us.” She started pounding heavily on the door and continued pleading, but we already began running in the opposite direction. 

We barged through the entry way doors, and I was half tempted to kiss the ground as I stepped foot on the parking lot. I looked around at my friends, their faces mixed with emotions partially excited but also terrified. We recorded a quick outro outside of the school, I'm unsure if it will be usable since we are so clearly shaken up. Dan gave a couple middle fingers to the old school, but Todd and I didn't look back. Finally I put the camera away and we got into my car, relieved to be heading home, and ready to post the video of what we found. 

SEVEN.

It didn't take long for the video to blow up like we suspected. I spent the entire next day editing the video so I could post it as soon as possible. I was able to post it on Sunday night, just a day after our investigation. By Thursday the video was on the trending tab with a million views. Our channel blew up, gaining a half of a million subscribers already and didn't seem to be slowing down any time soon. We received a dozen DMs from other creators asking to collab or to ask us for the location of the school. But one DM stuck out in particular, it was from an individual named Josh. He was insistent on getting information about the girl we saw. 

Josh: Hey guys, my name is Josh Henshaw. I just saw your video and I know this may sound odd, but I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions about the girl. Its urgent 

His message made me curious so I agreed.

“Sure, what do you want to know about her?” 

Josh: Did you happen to see her eyes? If so, what color were they?

“I didn't really get a good look at them, it was too dark in there”

Josh: How about her right forearm? Did you see a scar shaped like a dog bite on her arm? 

I didn't remember much about her arm, so I looked back at the footage. I start by rewatching when she leapt at me in the computer lab. That's when I noticed something. I didn't drop the camera, she knocked it out of my hands when she jumped at me. I could clearly see her hand hitting the camera, and it was the same arm Josh asked about. I took a closer look at her arm and saw she did indeed have a dog bite shaped scar.

I sent another message to Josh, “Yes she does have a scar on her arm. How did you know that?” 

Josh: I thought that was her. Please, you need to tell me the location of the school. I can meet you somewhere if you don't trust me.” 

“I'm not telling you anything more until you tell me how you knew about her scar” 

Josh: Okay fine. I know about her scar because I think the girl you saw in the school is my missing sister.

There is a photo attached to the message. I opened it and saw a missing person poster, the girl on the poster looks exactly like the girl I saw in the school that night. Her name is Lucy Henshaw and she went missing nine months ago from a nearby county. 

I replied to Josh immediately with my phone number and gave him the location of the school. He told me he doesn't live too far from here, and we agreed to meet at my apartment tonight and then go to the police with our findings. 

EIGHT.

I stand outside the school once again with Josh, Todd, and Dan; but this time the school is bathed in flashing red and blue lights as the sun is setting behind it. The school is surrounded by what appears to be every police officer and EMT in town. The officers breached the school just moments ago and we were told to wait in the parking lot. 

Josh made it into town earlier this evening. As soon as he came into my apartment I knew he was telling the truth, I could see it in his eyes, they looked just like Lucy's. We skipped all formalities as he told me all the details of her disappearance. After I answered all of Josh's questions we went to the police station. 

  We told the story to the officer at the front desk. Officer Andersen didn’t seem to be convinced with our ghost girl in the school story, until I showed him the video and Josh pulled out the missing persons poster. Andersen put on his glasses to get a closer look at the girl, and saw that we were serious. He showed our proof to some of the nearby officers, they unanimously agreed to start an investigation. 

Then a couple hours later we arrived here. We weren't technically invited to join the investigation, but no one stopped us either.  

We sat in the parking lot for what felt like the entire night, but according to my watch it has been only 45 minutes. The sun has fully set by now and the night sky is beginning to take over. 

Finally the front doors opened, one of the officers exited the building with his arm around Lucy. Josh ran up to her as fast as he could without frightening her. Lucy watched him tensely until she recognized him, then she smiled and fell into his arms. He said something to her but I was out of earshot and I didn't want to intrude. 

The front doors opened again and two more officers walked out, holding a couple of young girls in their arms. The girls are gauntly thin, they look sickly but are alive nonetheless. The officers rushed them over to the ambulance. Todd pointed me to the front doors again and I saw three more officers rush out with girls in their arms as well.

I overheard the two officers talking to the EMTs “there are a couple more girls inside yet, Andersen is working on getting them free right now. One teen and one adult. These girls were chained upstairs in the elementary art room.” 

The other officer pointed to Lucy and said “that girl gave us quite the scare in there, she was the only girl not chained up. She said she escaped her chains last week and hit a ‘bad man’ with a brick, but she hasn’t seen him since.”

The three other officers approached the ambulances, setting the girls on the available gurneys, and asked how they could help. An officer named Lincoln turned to us and told us he is going to take Lucy back to the station to treat her there, and see what else she is willing to tell us tonight. Josh and I agreed to come with. 

NINE.

By morning a lot of my questions became answered.  Lucy was very open about her experiences in the school. She was very brave, with encouragement from her big brother Josh. She started by telling us that she tried to hurt Charlie with a brick because he was a bad man, but she couldn’t hit him hard enough and he dragged her back upstairs. That was the night that Charlie got into a car accident, Lincoln is going to look further into the autopsy but suspects Lucy gave him a concussion and that caused him to veer off the road as he was driving to the hospital. Eventually Lucy was able to escape her chains again, but couldn’t escape the West Wing since the doors were locked and the windows are boarded up. I felt pretty bad for closing the doors behind me as we fled that night. 

She also told us that Charlie has been kidnapping the girls from nearby towns. Lincoln pointed out that most of the girls rescued from the school are in the missing persons databases of neighboring counties. He showed the database to Lucy and she was able to point out a few more girls that used to be at the school but were picked up by another ‘bad man’. She said he comes from the south to pick up the girls who don’t behave. I told Lincoln about the man who was listed as Charlie's ‘next of kin’ that Todd mentioned last week. Lincoln pulled up the man's information and found his photo. He showed the photo to Lucy, she cried but confirmed it was him. His name is Arnold, and he even looked like a creep. He should have made it into town by now according to my conversation with Todd. Lincoln had his doubts that he would show at all, but said they would keep trying to reach him until he is caught. 

Later when the IT department went through the computer in Charlie's office and they validated what Lucy said. They found hundreds of messages between Charlie and Arnold that revealed a bigger trafficking ring led by Arnold. At that point they turned the case over to the FBI for a large-scale operation.  

That was the last of officer Lincoln's questioning. Then the on-site nurse gave Lucy a quick evaluation. Lucy said she felt fine, so the nurse told her to get plenty of rest over the next few days and drink plenty of water. Lucy asked about the other girls in the school; the nurse said they are all going to be okay and that the officers are reaching out to their parents now. 

Finally Lincoln said we are free to leave, but we have to stay in town until the investigation is complete. I extended an offer to Josh and Lucy to stay at my place for a few days, which they accepted. We left the department grateful for all they have done, but hopeful we wouldn't have to return any time soon

We arrived at my apartment before noon. Before I could even offer my bedroom to Lucy she was asleep on the couch. Josh fell asleep on the recliner adjacent to her, unwilling to leave her side. I left two glasses of water on the coffee table with a note telling them to help themselves to anything in the kitchen. I walked into my bedroom and turned on my computer. Officer Lincoln told me to delete the video of the school for the remainder of the investigation. I wasn’t sure how long that would be, so I began writing my experiences here while the memories and emotions are still fresh. Surprisingly my Youtube channel no longer feels as important. I have new friends to care for now, along with my old ones. Maybe a break from ghost hunting will do me good, because I certainly found more than I was hoping to. 

So that’s all for now Midwest Ghost Viewers, until next time. Thank you",1,1752807694.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False

For iOS!,"**\[R3BEL CRT PORTABLE\]** for iOS  [Download \[R3BEL CRT PORTABLE\] for N64 Here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Im-MHX7If_Fo1J9wG73NXJvbfJb0uNMd?usp=share_link)

***\*\* Highly Recommended to read through the*** [“READ ME” file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wDBp0r4CumA-YiCDGMq5xeIacXcNaCzY/view?usp=share_link) ***through this link. It thoroughly explains the details of these skins and also has a list of recommendations for which skin to use for specific games. \*\****

Another one that has been in the making for a while and they’re finally ready! These N64 skins are some of my most complex skins to date! They are CRT style skins that use Core Image Filters to distort the game screen to create a bubble style screen similar to the old CRT televisions. They also feature a reflective bezel, mirroring the game image on the inner edges of the screen bezel. They are definitely not perfect CRT's, but seeing that Delta does not support actual third party shaders this is the closest I could get.

**RELEASE NOTES:**

1. The CRT PORTABLE versions have complete control sets to play on the go  
2. iPhone versions only supports edge-To-Edge iPhones (phones with no home button) 
3. In addition to the labeled quick utility functions there is also a hidden ""Hold to FFW"" button on top of the game screen/display  
4. Due to the complexity of the N64 controller I had to remove the QuickLoad button from the Landscape layout. However, you can still flip to portrait to use the QuickLoad in the time of need ;)
5. In addition to the standard Z and R buttons there are additional “convenience” Z and R buttons to help with certain games.
   * For example, the added “convenience” Z button in the middle of the C-Buttons cluster to make it easier to play Banjo Kazooie to its full potential. Also helps in some racing games, and with Goldeneye 007. While using the c-buttons to strafe you can easily tap in the center to fire your weapon. 
   * The added “convenience” R-button along side the A-button is to make it easy to access your shield in Zelda Ocarina of Time, or to drift/hop in Mario Kart 64, and makes for a quick/easy way to adjust the camera in games like DK64 or Conkers Bad Fur Day while moving your character.
6. There are hidden combination buttons between the A+B, A+Z, and B+Z buttons to help with games like super Mario 64 and all the combo jump buttons.These buttons are mapped to overlap the primary buttons, but they are layered below the primary buttons which allows you to slide between buttons without losing contact with the original button pressed.  

**OVERSCAN & PER GAME RECOMMENDATIONS** 

***\*\**** *These skins have only been tested and designed for the NTSC / US Rom files. Using Other / PAL formats may or may not look as expected.****\*\****

**What is Overscan? -** Overscan on a CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) television is a display setting where the image is intentionally zoomed in, causing the edges of the picture to be cut off and not visible on the screen. This was a common practice on older CRT/Tube TVs. 

**Delta N64 Emulator Overscan -** N64 games were designed by game developers to be played on CRT displays which causes some games to have black bars or borders that show on the game emulators like Delta. 

* These skins with “Overscan 1.0, 2.0, or 3.0” are designed to simulate the same behavior to help hide those bars and give a more authentic play experience. 
* Each of these skins have different levels of cropping applied to the game screen image. With “no overscan” being as implied, no cropping at all. While “overscan 3.0” has the most cropping in from the edges. 
* Please see the last image in this post for a comparison of Banjo Kazooie with No Overscan skin vs the Overscan 2.0 skin. 

* *If you have any requests for specific games to crop out the black borders that these do not work for. Please let me know.*  

As always, feedback is always welcome. Good, bad, or ugly. all is welcome ;)

If you've known me or reading my posts for the past few months you must be slightly aware (given I caught your attention) on how terrible my sleep cycle is. I'm the type to stay awake till 0700 than to wake up at 0700.

Long story short, everything boiled down to some funny chemicals not working right in my brain and I've been under scrutiny for a tiny while now and will be for a little longer.

So, yesterday night was the first time I felt sleepy without any external help, as in medication (but I took them cause I had to keep the course going) and eventually slept before 2300. That is NOT normal for me. And I woke up by 0645 this morning which is also NOT normal for me.

This might not seem a grand thing for most of you, but for me, not relying on others or alarm clocks to wake up and stay awake, wash clothes is everything, at this point.

I REALLY hope I stick to it, and when I do, I'll come update you again. Not like you want an update, but this space is precious for me, so writing here brings me joy. 

Also yes, I am still washing my coffee mugs immediately, or atleast on the same day :)

After countless hours of research and personal experience, I've figured out what works best.

For small spaces, round or oval coffee tables are usually the best choice. They create better flow since there are no sharp corners to bump into, and they make it easier to move around in tight spaces. I recently helped my sister pick out a round coffee table for her studio apartment, and it completely transformed her living room.

Square tables can work too, but they need more clearance space around them. I've found that if you're going square, it's better to choose one with rounded corners. You can find some great options here: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables

The height of your coffee table matters just as much as its shape. I recommend choosing one that's about the same height as your sofa cushions or slightly lower. This creates a balanced look and makes it comfortable to reach for drinks or remote controls.

Here's what I've found works best for different room layouts:

- Long, narrow rooms: Oval coffee tables
- Square rooms: Round coffee tables
- Open concept spaces: Any shape, but round tends to look best
- Tiny spaces: Nesting tables that can be tucked away

Storage is another crucial factor in small spaces. I've seen some clever designs with hidden compartments and lift-top surfaces. These are perfect for storing magazines, blankets, or even laptop chargers.

The material choice can also impact how spacious your room feels. Glass or acrylic tables create an illusion of more space since you can see through them. I was skeptical at first, but after seeing one in my friend's apartment, I was convinced.

If you're interested in exploring different options, I found this collection particularly helpful: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables. They have a great selection of space-saving designs that work well in smaller rooms.

For those really tight on space, consider these alternatives:
- C-shaped side tables that slide under your sofa
- Ottoman coffee tables that double as extra seating
- Folding tables you can store when not in use

Remember, the key is to maintain about 18 inches between your coffee table and seating. This allows comfortable movement while keeping everything within reach.

I've found that the right coffee table can do more than just hold your drinks - it can make a small space feel more organized, functional, and welcoming.

## Key Features Analysis

The characteristics of a genuine bear claw extend beyond simply what meets the eye. Quality ingredients combined with expert technique yield a product that is both visually appealing and exceptionally flavorful. These key elements contribute to the overall enjoyment of the pastry.

**Flaky Pastry:** The foundation of any good bear claw is a perfectly laminated, buttery pastry. This involves layering dough with generous amounts of butter, folding it multiple times, and then resting it to allow the gluten to relax. The result is a light, airy, and incredibly flaky texture that shatters with each bite. A well-made laminated dough should have distinct layers noticeable both visually and texturally.

**Almond Filling:** The conventional filling for a bear claw is an almond paste, typically composed of ground almonds, sugar, and eggs. This filling should be moist, slightly sweet, and intensely almond-flavored. Some variations use a frangipane, which is a richer almond cream made with butter. Regardless of the exact recipe, the almond filling should be evenly distributed throughout the pastry and not be dry or grainy. High-quality almond extract helps contribute to a distinctive flavor within the baked good.

**Almond Topping:** Genuine bear claws are invariably adorned with slivered or sliced almonds on top.These almonds provide a textural contrast to the soft filling and flaky pastry. The almonds should be toasted to a golden brown to enhance their nutty flavor and crispness. The visual appeal of a generous layer of almonds is undeniable and a crucial part of the bear claw experience. Freshly cut slivered almonds are best for ensuring a uniform size and shape to allow for even toasting, especially in the oven or in a confectionary plant surroundings.

**Glaze (Optional):** Some bakeries add a light glaze to the finished bear claw for extra sweetness and shine. This glaze is typically made from powdered sugar and water, sometimes with a hint of vanilla or almond extract.A well-applied glaze should be thin and evenly distributed, adding a glossy finish without making the pastry overly sticky. The glazing adds a sweet component that compliments the almond paste and gives the bear claw an attractive sheen and shine.Key features of the Genuine Bear Claw include:

*   Buttery laminated Dough.
*   Authentic Almond Filling.
*   Visible Toasted almonds.
*   Light, non-sticky Glaze.

## FAQs Section

Consumers may have questions on what makes an authentic and reliable bear claw, or may need specifications for dietary considerations or allergen data. Here are a few common questions.

**Are genuine bear claws suitable for individuals with nut allergies?**

No, traditional bear claws contain almonds. They are not suitable for individuals with nut allergies. Some bakeries might offer nut-free alternatives, but it's crucial to confirm the ingredients and preparation methods to avoid any risk of cross-contamination.

**How should genuine bear claws be stored?**

Genuine bear claws are best consumed fresh. However, if you need to store them, keep them in an airtight container at room temperature. They can also be refrigerated for a longer shelf life, but this may affect the texture of the pastry. Warming them slightly before serving can help restore some of their original flakiness.

**Can genuine bear claws be frozen?**

Yes, bear claws can be frozen for later consumption. Wrap them individually in plastic wrap and then place them in a freezer-safe bag or container. When ready to eat, allow them to thaw at room temperature or warm them gently in an oven or microwave. Freezing and thawing can slightly affect the texture, but it's a good way to preserve them for later.

So, I (32M) have this mug. It’s not valuable or anything, just a regular ceramic mug — but it was a gift from my late grandfather. He gave it to me when I got my first job out of college, and I’ve used it almost every workday since. So yeah, *emotionally* it means a lot.

I always keep it in the break room cupboard, tucked behind a bunch of other mugs. Everyone here knows it’s mine — it literally has my name on it in giant block letters.

Yesterday, I walked into the break room and saw someone sipping coffee from it. It was a new hire, some intern, just casually using it like it was nothing. I asked her where she got the mug and she said, “Oh, I just grabbed one. Is it yours?”

I said yeah, and told her I’d appreciate it if she didn’t use it again.

She sort of laughed and said, “Relax, it’s just a mug.”

I snapped. I said, “No, it’s not just a mug. It’s mine. And if you’re going to go around touching people’s stuff without asking, maybe you don’t belong in a professional environment.”

She looked stunned and walked out. Later, I heard she cried in the bathroom. My boss pulled me aside and said I overreacted and created a “hostile tone.”

I get that it wasn’t a huge deal in the grand scheme of things — and I definitely could’ve handled it better. But I also feel like if someone takes your personal belonging, brushes it off, and tells you to ""relax,"" they kinda brought that on themselves?

I don’t know how to explain this without sounding like a villain, but I got promoted last week because I lied during a team meeting. And not a little white lie like “Sure, I saw your email,”I mean a full-on, straight-faced corporate fib.

It all started when our manager asked, “Who here is confident with Excel?” My body went still. My soul left. My ancestors felt a disturbance in the force.

But no one raised their hand. Not even Mark, who once created a pivot table so powerful it almost got him a date.

I don’t know what came over me some ancient spirit of unemployment anxiety or pure panic but my hand shot up like I was trying to hit the ceiling. “Yeah,” I said, in a voice that cracked like my WiFi during Zoom calls, “I *love* Excel.”

You’d think I just admitted to loving puppies and paying taxes. The room gasped in relief.

Next thing I know, I’m the “Excel guy.” I have my own Slack channel. People come to me with spreadsheets that look like they were designed by Da Vinci’s sleep-deprived intern. I Google *every single thing*. My search history is 90% “how to do that green triangle thing Excel mad about.”

Then the promotion came. “You’re a real team player,” they said. “Leadership material,” they said.

Meanwhile, I’m in the break room watching YouTube tutorials on “VLOOKUP for people who just want to cry.”

Now I’m terrified. Every day I live in fear someone will ask me to do a macro and I’ll accidentally send a virus to HR.

So yeah, I lied. But I also got a raise, free coffee, and an office with a door that mostly shuts. Moral of the story? Never underestimate the power of confidence, caffeine, and Ctrl+Z.

Im 23, I have a 2 year old daughter. Me and her dad have been together since 2020. We were doung pretty good and he was working and I was working with him in this business we created. However- he had some legal troubles come up- coatly attorneys fees, and we ended up needing to move to my moms granny flat due to a whole bunch of stuff i cannot even begin to lay out here. Recently- those legal trubles unexpectedly led to him bieng incarcerated. So here i am. Ive got 9 more months to be on my won and already this shit is not pretty. To start- i already had a full time job; being a mom: when i had spare time id work on the business. So- also a part time job. Now everything in the business is up to me- and everything else i already had to do. Ive been getting some childcare form my mon. Every day i am on task all day jugglung and struggling just basic life tasks like tidying the house with a mandatory order i have to complete. I find myself running out of energy before i can finish everything, i drink coffee to push through, i stay up late to finish things. I am reallybonly getting maybe 5-7 hours per week from my mom where she has my daughter- and im at work and i work un-interrupted. But shes been unrealible- as much ad she cares: shes always been unrelaible, late, flakey, emotionally unstable, and shes broke. Ive been having to randomly shell out $ 200- 700 to help her with her bills(im already paying rent) and any given week even if i ask her; she can't promise me any solid days or times where i can go work.Im missing deadlines and behind and im growing so sick of this dysfunction and becoming really really unhappy. I keep telling her hey- i need to go to work tomorrow for a long day- and shell futs around the house, not really make herself available or chalk it up to my duaghter being insecure with me leaving right now, or shes too tired to watch my kid alone or--- yout get it; and ill maybe if im lucky get out of the house to work at 4- 7 pm. After wasting all that time on bs and toxic arguments and dsyfucntion.
I told her when my partner was locked up ill need her to be solid; especially STARTING out; so i can do the things, and extra work to set things up so i dont KEEP ON  needing her, basically so i can hire out some help, train people, do some adjustments so i need less of MY OWN TIME to keep the business going. But i havent had it, and were 3 months in and im scraping by, shes scraping by. I feel so stuck i dont know how to leave this situation. I want my own space,  that has a garage or shed so I can work there more, but i donk know if i can afford a place more than my moms rn, and i have no idea where i can get childcare that I can afford. If i had reliable childcare now maybe i could make enough money to but thats a catch 22 and i cant be sure. I feel like i have nowhere to go, no slack, no support, im limmited and we're all suffering. Me and my mom have not gotten along great simce my teens and the more im back, tge worse it gets and my mental health is suffering. I appreciate that i have her help- however dysfunctional but at the same time i have to say- man its not enough- she F'd up even without me being a burden and this cannot go on.

My boss sent my coworker Lilly and I out on an extended mission. He said we need to “Be careful, it's a dangerous organization. We need you two to see what they are planning.” My coworker Lilly is experienced in the field of spying more than I am. I've had some experience but not a whole lot. The higher ups always like complimenting me though saying “Oh that Aki girl is going to do well once she gets more experience. She’s already top of her spy training class. And my have you seen her gorgeous dark brown hair, and her ocean light blue eyes. Girl was made to spy and go undercover.” Anyways Lilly and I are on some sort of big shipping dock. We were told to go undercover, Lilly as Rosie and me, Aki, as Amber. 
We headed for the ship with red and blue stripes that the boss had shown us a picture of and he told us to “Get on the ship and act as waiters for the restaurant. In the back there will be a room with stairs leading down to the cooler. Find it and find the plan for when they are striking on us.”
We go into a closet, change into waitering clothes and start serving. I tell Rosie that “I’m going to go get more ice, I’ll be back.” Rosie nods. I went down to the cooler to find the plan where we got a notice that it should be in here. It’s not here. I saw nothing here but ice cream and cold meat. It’s freezing here, I can taste the cold and I hate the cold. 
I want to get this mission over with already. I suddenly hear a door slam behind me and all I see through the cooler window is Rosie, well Lilly. She turns around and her light blond hair shines and her dark green forest eyes look up at me, they're sharp and intense. I go to the door, wrap my hand around it and turn the knob to open the door. It won't budge, the door is locked.
Lilly says “This is what you get when the higher ups are more impressed with a rookie than me, a HIGHLY trained spy! You couldn't even tell I was the messenger. Way to go, Aki.” I look at Lilly. “You were the messenger? The one who sent out every detail to where the plan would be. I had a feeling something wasn't right!” Lilly lets out a laugh of hysterics as to how the higher ups are impressed with me when she tricked me so easily. I look at her and tell her “I had a bad feeling about being set up with you, especially since you always glare at me and everyone else and you act all innocent in front of our boss. Boss and the rest of the team know where I am.”
“Oh Aki! The ship already took off about 10 minutes ago.” I look at Lilly with a big smile. She looks at me confused. 
In the distance we both hear the boss and the rest of the team. They come up fast behind Lilly, throw her to the ground and handcuff her. Boss lets me out of the cooler while the rest of the team takes Lilly away. The boss and the team snuck aboard the ship and stopped everyone else before it could take off anywhere. The boss explained to me as he put his heavy heated jacket over me that perfectly matched and complimented his gorgeous brown eyes and satin black hair. Lily looked back at me and she was taken away by the team for good. Boss and I go back to the office and have a cup of warm tea. He gives me a raise because of tonight and he appoints me as his personal spy and bodyguard.

After becoming the boss's personal spy and bodyguard he finally told me his real name, Kylian. He doesn't tell many people his real name except me and the higher ups, he has everyone call him boss as to not get too close to everyone and to keep him safer. Kylian and I are going into a shop called “Rocky Gems”. It’s this big shop with a massive amethyst crystal in the front and a variety of smaller crystals throughout the whole shop. We’re looking for a specific blue sapphire crystal. This crystal is very important to our business and has been in the spy community for centuries. It’s the spy’s heirloom. The sapphire in itself is just a gorgeous crystal but it’s more like what it reminds us of more than just an accessory.
It reminds us of how no matter how small or big and weak or strong, the spy world will always have a place for you, if you find it, or it finds you. The whole reason this pretty little shiny rock means anything is because of Zolia Harsica, the first female spy. She was my great-great-grandmother and she created the whole spy system and organization along with her husband my great-great-grandfather, Zeke. Well in this part of the world she did. My family has been in the spy business for generations and I’m set to be the next top spy.
Kylian and I find the sapphire and bring it back to our office, which is set inside this massive castle-like building. The higher ups and the team live in it with Kylian and I. We all have different rooms and areas of the castle of course. We set the sapphire back in its box, in the double safe.
	Being a bodyguard and spy for Kylian is interesting. I mean there’s hardly ever any real danger around him and even if there was he’s totally got it! He’s big and strong and I’ve seen him knock a few big guys out too. He’s got brute force, looks, and he’s intelligent. A triple threat, I like to joke with him about it from time to time though he usually just gives me a smirk. 
It’s funny to think about how Lilly was 26 and would talk about me getting the higher ups' attention. I'm 23, not much younger than her. However she never talked about the boss even though he’s 24 and was her boss, she never even complained shockingly. I guess she just knew and understood he was better. He is better. Better than all of us together I would bet. He’s crazy for thinking he needs a bodyguard spy, especially one like me. He’s way better at both of those things than I am. I just think he wants a friend or companion. As positive and gentle as he is he seems to get lonely and has no real friends. He loves to talk to me about how much I’ve grown as a bodyguard for him and a spy in general. He compliments me on a daily basis, he’s quite the gentleman and charmer, always saying things like  “I love the beach, we should go to the beach, your blue eyes remind me of the gorgeous ocean.” and other things like “And your hair is like wood in a fire, dark but light, warm and soft.” He’s a charmer for sure.
I spend most of my days now just hanging around Kylian and guarding him. He doesn't do much usually other than hang around the castle doing his office work. I’m always there with him since he asks me to be. I’ll bring him his favorite chai tea and ham sandwiches, like a maid, but I don't mind. His face always lights up whenever I enter the room and he gets this big grin on his face, kinda like a kid when they see a cute animal.
I’m always happy when she enters the room. She makes me feel seen and heard and not shadowed. I like her. I compliment her daily because, well it’s all true and she should know. I think I’ll ask her out for coffee or out to the town to go shopping for a date. I hope she'll say yes, or I might just end up ruining this nice feeling.
I’m in the study room with Kylian. He fell asleep hours ago, and I finally woke him up at 5:00 pm. He has a meeting with the higher-ups at 6:30. When I wake him up he looks at me sleepy eyed with messy hair and he says in a deep sleepy voice “You’re beautiful, like an angel.” It catches me off guard, I tell him with my voice sweet and cheerful “And you look like a sleepy prince, Kylian.” “What time is it?” Kylian asks and I respond with “It’s 5:00 pm. Your meeting is at 6:30.” “Thank you, Aki. Since tomorrow is Saturday, and I have no work to do. Would you like to go out on a date to the town and have dinner with me? If you’re interested.” His voice is slightly shaky and nervous unlike him when he normally talks to me. I look at Kylian wide eyed with a big smile practically jumping for joy and tell him “I would love to go out on a date with you tomorrow! What time should I be ready?” “Lovely than be ready by 1:00 pm.” “I will be ready by then.” I say.
Kylian walks out of the room to go to his meeting, he has a big smile on his face and a shiny gleam in his pretty dark brown eyes. I’m still in the room actually jumping for joy this time. “I need to figure out what to wear?!” I shout as I realize I say this outloud I burst out laughing. I’m happy. I’m off to my room to go through my closet and I find these pretty slick black high heels with a strap on the ankles so they stay on my feet easier. I’m thinking of keeping my hair curly like usual since he always looks at them. Silver is best for my accessories, it compliments me better. I’m looking through my dresses and I forgot I had bought this pretty ocean blue dress that matches with my eyes perfectly and I decide right then and there that that is the dress for Kylian and I’s first date. Everything was perfectly set for tomorrow. 
As I walk out of the room I have a big smile on my face because Aki said yes! She was so happy about me asking her out. I’m walking to go to my meeting and a little away I hear “I need to figure out what to wear?!” from Aki. I laugh and smile and realize after the meeting I need to figure out what to wear too. The meetings are always boring and this one was nothing different, just random stuff on how each of the branches were doing. I’m in my room looking through my closet, I bet Aki was rummaging through her closet earlier too. I’m thinking of something more fancy and nicer than the usual white dress shirt and black slacks I always wear. I look for my nice black dress shirt with blue flowers embroidered on the collar to match her eyes. I'll wear black dress pants and a dress suit jacket. I’m bringing her a bouquet of blue roses tomorrow.
	I called room service to order Aki, her favorite french toast, bacon, and scrambled eggs for her to eat in bed for tomorrow morning. I get some for myself while I’m at it.
*Knock knock* “It’s Kylian.” I hear at my door as I jump up from putting my shoes on to go to the door. I open the door and see him standing there and he looks so fancy and handsome. She opens the door and she looks absolutely stunning and perfect standing there in her blue dress. She’s like a pretty doll with her big blue doe eyes. “You look beautiful, like a little doll.” I say to her with a sweet smile. “Thank you, you look very handsome.” She replies with a chuckle. “Let’s go on our date.” She takes my arm, we both smile and we leave.
	My Mom reads to me as she closes the book and puts it back on my shelf, as she tucks me into bed and she says “Goodnight little Akaria.” My dad gives my forehead a kiss and he tells my mom “Come on Aki let’s let her go to sleep now.”

My mom told me he wasn’t interested, and honestly, I never thought much about him. He knew I existed, but just... wasn’t there.

Fast forward to this year, he reached out. Said he “wanted to reconnect.” Apparently, he’s been going to therapy and “realized what he missed out on.” Fine. I was open to meeting him, but I was cautious.

He’s been trying — kind of. We’ve gone for coffee a couple of times, he texts me random memes, and once sent me money on my birthday. That’s the extent of it. Not terrible, not amazing. Still weird.

Anyway, the issue happened last weekend. We were at a bookstore, and I picked up a manga that’s kinda spicy (nothing crazy, just typical teen stuff). He looked at it and went, “I don’t think this is appropriate for you.” I laughed and said, “I’m literally the age of the main character.” He frowned and said, “Well, I’m your dad and I’m telling you no.”

And I said, “You don’t get to suddenly be a dad because you remembered me this year.”

He went quiet and just nodded. We didn’t say much after that.

Later that night he texted something like, “I’m trying, and that hurt.” I didn’t respond.

Now I feel a little bad. But also… I wasn’t trying to be cruel. I just don’t think someone gets to skip the hard parts and show up only when they feel ready — then start setting rules like they’ve been here the whole time.

* Most Canadian AMEX shutdowns are due to purchasing large amounts of gift cards at grocery stores, specifically on the Cobalt Card which awards 5x MR (equivalent to 7 Aeroplan points/Avios per $1 USD) for grocery and dining spend.
* Co-wrote this play to mock claims that AMEX will shutdown people for having round number purchases at grocery stores, because again and again, a select group of armchair experts keep popping up claiming that as long as your grocery store purchases aren't round numbers, AMEX can't know if you're buying $500 of Kale, or $500 of gift cards (because Canada doesn't have L3 data).
* Common ""obfuscation"" tactics are to spend slightly less than the $2500 grocery bonus cap, to add a banana to your gift card order at check-out, to split gift card purchases into multiple $450 transactions and to spend only $450 in groceries, not $500.

**Characters:**

* **BARBARA (50s):** Senior Manager, Membership Rewards, Canada. Perpetually optimistic, armed with a thesaurus of corporate jargon she doesn’t quite understand.
* **GARY (40s):** Senior Risk Analyst. A man whose soul has been replaced by lukewarm coffee and existential dread. He’s seen it all and is deeply unimpressed.
* **CHAD (20s):** Junior Analyst. A recent business school graduate who believes his Reddit lurking has made him a master profiler of credit card churners.
* **MR. HENDERSON (60s):** VP, Global Loyalty. A disembodied, perpetually furious face on a large television screen, beamed in from New York.
* **PRIYA (20s):** A hyper-competent computer science summer intern. She speaks quietly, but her code is deafening.

**Setting:**

The 18th-floor boardroom of the American Express Canada headquarters in Toronto. It’s a space defined by its aggressive beige-ness. A massive mahogany table is surrounded by uncomfortable chairs. One wall is a giant, smeary whiteboard. A wilting fiddle-leaf fig plant slumps in the corner, a metaphor for employee morale.

# Act I: The Mythology of the Mundane

**(The scene opens on the boardroom. BARBARA stands proudly before the whiteboard, which features a hand-drawn, nearly incomprehensible flowchart connecting a picture of a credit card to a sad face with a dollar sign for a tear. GARY stares into his coffee cup as if it holds the secrets to the universe. CHAD sits bolt upright, eager and alert. On the large screen at the end of the table, the face of MR. HENDERSON glowers.)**

**BARBARA:** Welcome, Task Force Cobalt Maelstrom! As you know, we’re here to synergize our proactive methodologies and disrupt the negative-growth paradigm impacting our flagship Membership Rewards ecosystem.

**MR. HENDERSON (On screen, voice booming):** Cut the corpo-babble, Barbara. The Cobalt card is bleeding points. It’s our golden goose, and it’s being plucked bald by these… these *churning people*. I want to know who they are, and I want their points forfeited yesterday!

**BARBARA:** (Flustered but recovering) Absolutely, Mr. Henderson. A full-funnel deep dive is already actioned. Chad, present the preliminary psychographic profile.

**(CHAD stands, puffing out his chest. He clicks a remote, and a single, grainy image of a Reddit comment appears on the screen.)**

**CHAD:** Thank you, Barbara. Gentlemen. I’ve embedded myself deep within the digital trenches of the enemy: Reddit. Specifically, r/churningcanada. These aren’t your average consumers. They’re the ‘Cobalt cowboys.’ They’re clever. Devious.

**GARY:** (Without looking up) They’re dudes buying gift cards at Safeway.

**CHAD:** (Ignoring him) It’s more complex than that, Gary. They’ve developed sophisticated obfuscation tactics. They know our algorithm won't detect them if they spend under $2500 on food, because the rumour is the mainframe programmer retired on a golden parachute of 20 million Membership Rewards points.

**(MR. HENDERSON squints at the screen.)**

**MR. HENDERSON:** So their grand strategy is to spend… slightly less? And what is this nonsense about a programmer?

**CHAD:** It’s about their mindset, sir. They believe they've found a systemic loophole. Furthermore, they mask their bulk gift card purchases. They’ll buy four $500 Visa cards… and a single banana. The variance in the final total—say, $2000.89 instead of a flat $2000—is designed to fool our rudimentary algorithms.

**BARBARA:** A banana… diabolical.

**GARY:** Yes, only a true criminal mastermind would think to purchase fruit.

**CHAD:** They also mix in legitimate-looking spend. About 10% of their 5x points come from dining at places like Moxie’s or The Keg. It creates a plausible narrative. “Oh, I’m just a foodie who also does a lot of grocery shopping.” It’s a performance.

**BARBARA:** So what you’re saying is… we’re not just fighting transactions. We’re fighting… *a story*. I love it. It’s actionable!

**MR. HENDERSON:** I don’t want a story, Barbara, I want scalps! We’re drowning in paper statements up here. What’s the plan?

**GARY:** (Sighs, finally looking up) The plan is what it’s always been. I get a list of high-spenders. I get a banker’s box of their statements, printed on actual paper. I look for transactions at grocery stores that are perfect, round numbers. It takes me about three weeks to review one account. By the time I prove abuse, they’ve already churned another ten thousand dollars’ worth of points.

**(PRIYA, the intern, who has been silently typing on her laptop in the corner, clears her throat.)**

**PRIYA:** Excuse me?

**BARBARA:** (Startled) Oh! Priya. I forgot you were here. Getting the coffee, are we?

**PRIYA:** I was just thinking… looking at paper statements seems inefficient. We have all this transaction data in digital form. You could write a—

**BARBARA:** (Waving a dismissive hand) Thank you for the input, Priya, but this is nuanced, human-centric inquisition work. The Spanish Inquisition wasn’t done with computers!! It requires intuition. We can’t just throw technology at it. Now, team, new directive! Gary, Chad. You’re going into the field. I want you to go to a Metro and observe. Watch the carts. Feel the churner’s energy. Become the banana.

**(Barbara smiles triumphantly. Gary slowly puts his head in his hands. Chad scribbles furiously in his notepad, ""Operation: Become the Banana."" Mr. Henderson’s face on the screen freezes, then goes dark.)**

**(FADE OUT.)**

# Act II: The Query and the Quagmire

**(The boardroom, one week later. The whiteboard now has a crude drawing of a banana with a circle and a line through it. The stack of paper statements on the table has doubled. GARY looks even more tired, if that were possible. CHAD is vibrating with excitement.)**

**BARBARA:** Welcome back, Task Force. Report from the front lines! Chad?

**CHAD:** (Standing and launching a PowerPoint) Mission success. We observed multiple subjects at a Metro downtown. I personally witnessed a male, mid-30s, purchase five $100 Amazon gift cards… and a single avocado.

**BARBARA:** An avocado! They’re evolving.

**CHAD:** He paid, and as he walked away, he looked back over his shoulder. A classic counter-surveillance maneuver. I have his license plate. I have his loyalty card number. I have the SKU of the avocado. We have our man.

**GARY:** (Monotone) He was nervous because you were hiding behind a pyramid of canned peaches, breathing like a pervert. I spent the afternoon in the car updating my fantasy football roster.

**(The face of MR. HENDERSON reappears on the screen. He looks apoplectic.)**

**MR. HENDERSON:** Fantasy football! While my company is being fleeced! Barbara, this is a circus. I just got the quarterly numbers. The points liability for the Cobalt card has exceeded the GDP of a small island nation. We are a financial institution, not a charity for grocery-savvy Canadians! Fix it! Now!

**BARBARA:** (Sweating) Right. Of course. New paradigm. We need to be more aggressive. What if… what if we just call them? We get the high-spenders on the phone and ask, “Did you buy $2000 worth of kale, or was it gift cards, you scoundrel?” I pray they don't call our bluff, knowing that we don't have their Level 3 Data.

**GARY:** And forty-seven lawyers from the Competition Bureau rappel through the windows? We can’t.

**(The room falls into a panicked silence. All eyes are on Barbara. She shuffles papers, avoiding their gaze. PRIYA clears her throat again, this time a little louder.)**

**PRIYA:** Mrs. McCallum?

**BARBARA:** What is it, Priya?

**PRIYA:** We have a structured database with every transaction from every cardholder. It has merchant codes, timestamps, amounts, everything. I could write a simple SQL query to flag suspicious patterns in seconds.

**BARBARA:** An S… Q… L? Is that a new key performance indicator?

**CHAD:** (Scoffs) You can’t understand the *art* of the churn with code. It’s about the human element. The subtle tells. The banana.

**PRIYA:** With respect, the banana is irrelevant. The key isn't just round numbers, it's statistical outliers. The median monthly grocery spend for a Cobalt cardholder is, say, $650. I can write a query to flag any account with a grocery spend more than two standard deviations above that median. That isolates the extreme volume. Then, within that group, I can filter for high-velocity grocery transactions. That finds the gift cards. It's a two-layer trap. I can build a dashboard that updates in real-time. It would take me… an afternoon.

**(Gary lifts his head, a flicker of something resembling hope in his eyes.)**

**GARY:** Let the intern cook.

**MR. HENDERSON:** I don’t care if you consult a Ouija board, just get me results! Do whatever the intern says.

**(Barbara, cornered, forces a smile.)**

**BARBARA:** Excellent! A wonderfully disruptive, tech-forward solution. Priya, you are now officially actioning the SQL initiative. We’re all counting on you.

**(Priya nods, a small, confident smile playing on her lips. She turns back to her laptop and her fingers begin to fly across the keyboard. Gary, Chad, and Barbara watch her as if she’s defusing a bomb. The sound of her rapid, rhythmic typing is the only sound in the room.)**

**(FADE OUT.)**

# Act III: Pyrrhic Victory

**(The boardroom, two days later. The whiteboard has been wiped clean and now features a projection of a sleek, elegant data dashboard titled “PROJECT COBALT CRUSHER.” Bar graphs and pie charts glow in cool blues and greens. The paper statements are gone. PRIYA stands beside the screen with a laser pointer. BARBARA, CHAD, and GARY are gathered around. MR. HENDERSON is on the main screen, watching intently.)**

**PRIYA:** As you can see, the two-layer query was successful. First, we isolated accounts with grocery spend two standard deviations above the median. Then, within that group, we found 312 accounts exhibiting high-velocity, multi-location transactions. The round-number theory was a red herring. For example, Cardholder 4082 hit three different Metro stores in one hour with transactions of $501.29, $500.89, and $499.50. They just added a banana to each purchase. These are your abusers.

**(Gary lets out a low whistle. Chad looks slightly crestfallen that the answer was so simple.)**

**GARY:** Incredible. You did in an afternoon what would have taken me a decade.

**MR. HENDERSON:** (A slow smile spreading across his face) Beautiful. It’s… beautiful. Shut them down. Make an example outta these Cobalt cowboys.

**BARBARA:** (Stepping forward, putting a hand on Priya’s shoulder) *We* did it, Mr. Henderson. A true synergy of generational talent. I even provided some key intuitive tweaks to Priya’s… query.

**PRIYA:** (Her smile tightens) You did.

**BARBARA:** Yes. I realized these “cowboys” were clever. They wouldn’t *just* make round-number purchases. So I had Priya add a secondary filter based on Chad’s brilliant field research. We flagged anyone whose monthly grocery spend was over four times the national average but *just under* the $2500 monthly cap. A clear signal of someone who knows the rules and thinks they're being sneaky.

**(Priya’s face remains neutral. Gary’s eyes widen in horror.)**

**GARY:** Barbara, no… you can't just...

**CHAD:** Wait… just under the cap?

**(Chad’s face goes pale. He frantically peers at the dashboard projection.)**

**BARBARA:** The results speak for themselves! The initial query found 312 accounts. My intuitive enhancement found… (She squints at the screen) …an additional 4,118 accounts! A resounding success!

**MR. HENDERSON:** Four thousand! Hot damn! Barbara, that’s leadership! That’s a promotion! We’ll call it the “Barbara Filter.” Start freezing the accounts!

**(Suddenly, Chad lets out a small, strangled gasp. He points a trembling finger at the long list of flagged accounts on the screen.)**

**CHAD:** Wait a minute... scroll down. Cardholder 8... 6... 7... 5... (His voice cracks) That's... that's my cardholder name. I'm on the list.

**BARBARA:** (Her smile vanishes, replaced by cold fury. She turns on him.) So, the ‘master profiler’ was a Cobalt cowboy all along. Buying Visa gift cards, were we, Chad? Fleecing the company you swore to protect?

**CHAD:** (Voice trembling) No! It's for my blog! Meal prep! I told you, I fly under the radar!

**(Gary’s phone buzzes. He looks at it. Then it buzzes again. And again.)**

**GARY:** The call center is on fire. A woman from Oakville is screaming that we’ve ruined her daughter’s wedding because she bought gift cards for the caterer. A dad in Calgary says we froze his account right after he paid for his son’s hockey team pizza party. They’re all… normal people with large families.

**MR. HENDERSON:** (Beaming, oblivious) Collateral damage in a successful war! Don’t worry about it. Celebrate, team! You’ve slain the beast!

**(Barbara puffs out her chest, taking full credit. Chad is frantically trying to call the customer service line, getting a busy signal. Amid the chaos, Gary discreetly walks over to Priya.)**

**GARY:** (Whispering) My friend is the CTO at Shopify. They’re hiring. I sent him your resume. Get out of here before they make you Vice-President of Banana Analytics.

**(Priya looks at Gary, then at the dashboard. She zooms in on the 312 accounts she originally flagged. Their spending continues, unabated. They were never touched. The “Barbara Filter” only swept up the innocent and the idiotic. She looks at the chaos unfolding—Barbara preening, Chad panicking, Henderson celebrating a victory over phantoms.)**

**(A slow, knowing smirk spreads across Priya’s face. She closes her laptop, picks up her bag, and walks silently out of the boardroom, leaving the inmates to run the asylum.)**

**(The final image is the glowing dashboard, showing the real churners continuing to rack up points, while Chad is put on hold to the sound of smooth jazz, a victim of his own mythology.)**

Physical Basketball 

With Tatum out. We need a SF to take minutes. So who is that going to be?

Watching Baylor Scheierman in the 2025 regular season he had moments. Moments of hot shooting, became a fan favorite for a span of 2 weeks. But never took the torch away from Hauser. Given his shooting form is atrocious compared to Hauser….

Jordan Walsh has been a disappointment so far considering he has not cracked the rotation in 2 years. Plays physical, inconsistent shooter, dumb fouls, average to above average defense. But what really is he? No one knows. 

Here are my theories:
Walsh = Aaron Nesmith try-hard 
Scheirmann = Hauser wannabee

Going back to my main question - what did 2025 NBA playoff basketball tell us - You can’t play 5 out against well-rounded NBA teams. 

2025 Playoff Celtics got dominated by Towns/Brunson. Playing 5 out caused us to be stagnant… pressure skyrocketed… every 3 in the 4th quarter had us slamming our coffee tables. That offense is not sustainable. 

So who would you rather have: a Nesmith try-hard or a Hauser wannabee..

You need to be physical in the NBA if you want to be a SF… end of story.

1m2qf6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1m2qf6a/can_you_use_a_storage_bench_as_a_coffee_table/,Can you use a storage bench as a coffee table?,"As someone who's been experimenting with multi-functional furniture for years, I can confidently say that storage benches make excellent coffee tables. I recently discovered this hack when I was trying to maximize space in my small apartment, and it's been a game-changer.

Storage benches are incredibly versatile. They not only provide a perfect surface for your coffee cups and magazines but also offer valuable hidden storage space underneath. I personally use mine to store extra throw blankets, board games, and even my laptop when I want to keep the living room tidy.

The height of most storage benches matches standard coffee tables, typically ranging between 16-20 inches. This makes them comfortable to use while sitting on your couch. I've found some great options here that work perfectly as coffee tables: https://explorehomedeals.com/storage-benches

Here's what makes storage benches ideal as coffee tables:

1. Extra storage space (obviously)
2. Durability - most are built to withstand weight
3. Various styles and materials available
4. Often cheaper than traditional coffee tables
5. Can double as extra seating when needed

One thing I learned through experience - look for benches with a flat, sturdy top. Some storage benches come with cushions, which isn't ideal for a coffee table setup. However, you can easily remove most cushions when using the bench as a table.

The size matters too. I recommend measuring your space first. Most storage benches are rectangular, similar to traditional coffee tables, making them perfect for living room layouts. I found several options that work great for different room sizes: https://explorehomedeals.com/storage-benches

To make it work even better as a coffee table, consider these tips:

- Use decorative trays to create a stable surface for drinks
- Add coasters to protect the top
- Choose a height that works with your existing furniture
- Pick a style that matches your room's decor

The best part about using a storage bench as a coffee table is the flexibility. When guests come over, you can quickly transform it back into seating. Plus, the hidden storage helps keep your living room clutter-free.

I've been using this setup for over a year now, and honestly, I don't think I'll ever go back to a traditional coffee table. The practicality is just unbeatable, especially if you're dealing with limited space or need extra storage solutions.

Remember to consider the weight capacity if you're planning to use it for seating too. Most storage benches are built sturdy enough to handle both functions without any issues.

In my experience, it's one of the smartest furniture decisions you can make for a modern living space. The functionality alone makes it worth considering, and the storage space is just an awesome bonus.",1,1752805220.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

1m2q6xv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectricians/comments/1m2q6xv/rv_surge_protector_tripping_every_morning/,RV surge protector tripping every morning,"Hello, and thanks for reading!

I have an RV watchdog surge protector that I'm using with my 50 amp service RV which is in an RV park. For the last 4 days, the surge protector has been throwing a code 8, which indicates a missing neutral, and shuts off the shore power supply. It happens about the same time every morning, 7:45-8:15 am. No one is ever in the RV at the time this happens, so it's not due to some appliance or device we're using, and we haven't been able to monitor any changes during this time that may trigger a fault. We dont have any device on a timer, like a coffee maker or anything. The breaker on the power pedestal doesnt trip, so we'll unplug and plug back in the surge protector, and everything works normally until next morning, including all 3 ACs starting and stopping regularly. I had my wife do a visual inspection of the plugs and power receptacle, and she claims to see no damage or scorching. The RV does have a solar power system and inverter to keep the power on, sans ACs and microwave, when the surge protector shuts off the shore power.

Unfortunately, I've been out of town since this began happening, so I haven't been able to do any troubleshooting. I consider myself handy, and I have some baseline electrical knowledge, but its certainly my weak point in DIY knowledge. Its either a loose neutral/ground somewhere on the RV that only presents at a narrow window of time, a defective surge protector that doesn't like mornings, or a faulty power outlet/anomaly in the incoming power.  I'm at a loss on how to trace the problem other than turning off devices in the RV and seeing if it happens again. I can also ask to plug into another site, but the camp is often very busy, and neighboring sites are occupied. I can possibly ask a neighbor to swap RV watchdogs with me to see if theirs trips while on my power pedestal, too, or if mine trips on their pedestal. The camp is aware of this issue, and claims they will investigate the power pedestal if it continues to happen.

Do you have any suggestions on how to troubleshoot the source of an intermittent, but regular, missing neutral? I have a multimeter and some electrical knowledge, but am willing to hire a pro of you think this is beyond me.

The frayed wire you soldered back together? That’s a chapter about persistence. The LED that flickers only when it’s cold? A mystery waiting to be solved. The breadboard covered in sticky notes (“Pin 3 = chaos”)? A map of your late-night troubleshooting odyssey. At r/CircuitryChroniclesA, we don’t just build circuits—we collect their stories. Every component has a voice, every connection a memory, and every time the multimeter beeps “voltage detected”?

The humidity readings spiked every time a squirrel ran past (turns out, fur + static = chaos). The third? It’s been chugging for 6 months, sending her text alerts when the tomatoes need watering. Last week, she called to say, ‘The circuit told me it rained overnight—you’re smarter than the weatherman.’ I framed the old, fried sensor. It’s my ‘hero’s journey’ trophy.”​Chronicle your “component crushes”: “Found a box of 1970s transistors at a garage sale—they smell like old radios. Used one in a guitar effects pedal. It hums a little, like it’s singing along to the music. The new transistors work better, but this one? It has history. I wrote its serial number in my notebook: ‘1973. Survived a basement flood.

1m2q4bh,https://www.reddit.com/r/branding/comments/1m2q4bh/luxury_brands_and_the_experience_economy/,Luxury Brands and the Experience Economy,"In today’s Experience Economy, that distinction isn’t optional. It’s table stakes for maintaining the elevated perception that defines “luxury.”
Joe Pine, co-author of The Experience Economy, has evangelized this shift for decades: companies must design experiences, not just transactions. Yet most brands still fumble with this idea, unsure how to translate it into their business model. Luxury brands, however, offer a blueprint not because they’ve adopted experiences, but because they’ve always been focused on the experience since it is paramount to perception.
I call this the rise of the Luxperience — when a luxury brand manifests its identity not just through products, but through immersive, fully branded environments. Think Prada’s high-design cafes, Ralph Lauren’s Euro-chic coffee bars, or Louis Vuitton’s opulent concept cruise ship, The Louis.
These aren’t gimmicks. They’re extensions of brand identity; built environments where customers don’t just buy, but belong.
→ Listen to the companion podcast episode on Brandy: https://apple.co/46cChW7
Luxury X Experience
Luxury has always had to stay ahead of being just a business based solely on transactions. This ensures an elevated perceived value, which leads to more premium, hence the ""luxury"" aspect. Luxury has intuitively tapped into internal narratives, identities, and signaling because luxury is focused (and dependent) on brand.
This is usually the direction many nonluxury brands need to go with their mindset, positioning, and overall experience to become healthier as a business and more relevant as a brand. Luxury companies are already here with a heavy focus on brand, so where are they to go?
Luxury brands are leading the way with very immersive experiences that are trailblazing paths in the Experience Economy. Although this economy stretches from Build-A-Bear Workshops to Disneyland, I’m personally very interested to see how the luxury market interprets effective experiences because they are already very brand-focused.
I like to call these brand experiences “luxperiences” because they are not only immersive, but very creative in the way they extend the brand. Fashion brands, for example, are predicated on their perception (brand) because not only does wearing the name make you feel a certain way, but it also empowers you to express yourself in a certain way and be perceived a certain way. These brands enable you to signal to others around you and are usually status symbols as well. Call it a “flex” or “showing off,” but these status symbols carry social currency that helps the individual place themselves in society as they place the product on their body.
Luxperience
A luxperience is the manifestation of this self-expression and signaling in an environment. I would even argue that you could summarize these feelings into a “theme” — this would consist of vibe, visual aesthetics, messaging, tone, materials, etc that evoke feelings which synthesize a theme. For example, Prada has opened a Prada Cafe along with a separate Prada Restaurant. No products to be seen, but the interiors and posture of these experiences are what you would expect when you think of Prada as an experience. Ralph Lauren successfully extended the brand into a Euro-inspired coffee shop called “Ralph’s Coffee Shop” which is a fun twist to even the nomenclature of the brand expansion. Again, no products other than those consumables you’d find in a traditional cafe.
On a very grand scale of this, Louis Vuitton set sail with a giant concept cruise ship called “The Louis” in Shanghai. This faux ship offers a shopping experience that includes shops, restaurants, a bar, and more. You enter the ship, set in the LV theme, and step into an experience reminiscent of the opulent, vintage ships from the past.
Although these luxury brands approach their own experiences in a variety of ways, the point is clear that experiences are a natural next step to increase value and overall brand appeal. For your business, you may not be able to do a luxperience, but you can learn plenty from them.
Learning from a Luxperience
As these brands invest millions upon millions of dollars into their luxperiences, what does this mean for your business? These luxury experiences emphasize the importance of brand as a foundation for business growth. When your brand is clear, it enables the business to expand beyond its initial offerings. This is how Prada is now selling entrees, LV built a boat, and Ralph Lauren has apron-wrapped baristas; the brand is used to extend the experience, which creates opportunities for the business to grow.
A key observation of these luxperiences is that the brand is deliberately carried over into these “exotic” contextual environments through elements that capture the vibe, tone, and overall feeling of the brand. From the iconic patterns of LV to Prada’s style expressed in interior design, you can see how these brands apply their themes. When you think about this for your own business, you must first have clarity about your brand, which can then create a “theme” that you leverage to shape additional experiences.
When your brand is properly constructed, the many elements of your identity work together to orchestrate a theme. The tone of your messaging, the visual elements, even the positioning you own in the market all accumulate to blend into a single theme; the more distinct you are, the more of a theme you’ll have.
The luxperience movement is an opportunity for you to review your brand and look at how you can gain more clarity in your strategy and identity to be more distinct and focus on your strengths. This will then allow you to explore how your theme can expand into creative extensions that fit your size. It might not be the size of a boat, but perhaps it is a special event, collaboration, or a new offering that can grow under your theme's umbrella to leverage the brand and expand your business",1,1752804362.0,branding,0,1.0,False

I’ve been toying with the idea of starting my own coffee shop something unique that I haven’t seen around here a Haitian coffee shop.
I was born in Haiti, adopted, and now live in beautiful British Columbia. I’ve been missing the taste of home the food, the drinks, the culture and it made me realize I’ve never seen a Haitian coffee shop in Abbotsford or Vancouver or anywhere nearby, really. So I thought, why not bring that to the community?
I’d love to create a cozy little space where people can experience Haitian culture through food, coffee, and warm vibes. I’m thinking of calling it either Ti Kafè or Kafè Kreyòl still deciding on the name!
Of course, this is just the beginning of the idea, and I know I’ll need help and support to make it real. If anyone’s interested, has advice, or just wants to share thoughts I’d love to connect!

Struggling to bootstrap your dream business? Feeling the pressure of limited capital? We’ve all been there. The good news is, you don't need a mountain of cash to access funding. Grants – that magical word meaning ""free money"" – are often overlooked but can be a game-changer. Let's unlock the secrets to securing those elusive grants, starting with strategies that won't break the bank!

**The Challenge:** Chasing Funding in a Crowded Market

Finding grants as a small business owner can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack. You’re bombarded with information, deadlines, and eligibility requirements. Time, a resource we never seem to have enough of, is sucked away by endless application forms. Plus, you might think you need to hire an expensive consultant to even have a shot. The reality? With the right approach and a little elbow grease, you can drastically increase your chances of landing that funding without emptying your wallet.

**Unlocking Grant Opportunities: Your Low-Cost Funding Blueprint**

Forget expensive consultants! This is about smart research, targeted applications, and leveraging free resources to give your small business the funding boost it deserves.

* **Step 1: Laser-Focus Your Grant Search with Free Databases:** Stop spraying and praying! Generic applications get you nowhere. Instead, use free online databases to pinpoint grants that are PERFECT for your specific industry, location, and business model.

    *   **Grants.gov:** This is the official website for US federal grants. It can be overwhelming, but use the advanced search filters to narrow down the results. For example, if you own a farm in Iowa, filter by ""Agriculture"" and ""Iowa."" Don’t just skim the titles, read the descriptions!
    *   **SBA.gov:** The Small Business Administration provides information on various funding options, including links to grant programs and resources for small businesses. Check their blog and resource center for updates.
    *   **Your State's Economic Development Agency:** Most states have websites dedicated to supporting local businesses, and these often list state-specific grants. Search ""[Your State] small business grants"" to find their official portal. Example: ""California small business grants.""
    *   **Brief Example:** Let's say you own a coffee shop that uses locally sourced beans. Search for grants related to ""sustainable agriculture,"" ""local food systems,"" or even ""community development"" in your region.

    *   **Pro-Tip:** Set up Google Alerts for keywords related to your industry and ""small business grants."" This will notify you when new funding opportunities are announced.

*   **Step 2: Craft a Compelling Narrative – For Free!** Grant applications are more than just ticking boxes; they're about telling your story. Why does your business deserve this funding? How will it benefit the community?

    *   **Highlight Your Impact:** Quantify your results. How many jobs have you created? How much revenue have you generated? How are you impacting your local community? Use concrete numbers whenever possible. ""Created 5 local jobs in the past year, contributing $250,000 in wages to the local economy.""
    *   **Address a Need:** What problem are you solving? Grant providers want to fund businesses that are making a difference. Are you providing a unique service? Filling a gap in the market?
    *   **Get Feedback (Free is Best!):** Don't go it alone! Ask a trusted friend, mentor, or even a local librarian to review your application. A fresh pair of eyes can catch errors or suggest improvements. Many local libraries offer free business resources and consultations.
    *   **Brief Example:** If you're applying for a grant to expand your bakery, explain how the expansion will create new jobs, source ingredients from local farmers, and provide affordable baked goods to the community.

    *   **Common Pitfall:** Don't just rehash your business plan. Tailor your application to the specific grant requirements and focus on how your project aligns with the funder's mission.

*   **Step 3: Network Like a Pro (Without Spending a Dime!):** Building relationships with grant providers and other business owners can significantly increase your chances of success.

    *   **Attend Free Local Business Events:** Your local Chamber of Commerce, Small Business Development Center (SBDC), and industry associations often host free networking events and workshops.
    *   **Utilize LinkedIn:** Connect with grant program managers and other business owners who have received funding. Send personalized messages to introduce yourself and learn more about their experiences.
    *   **Follow Grant Providers on Social Media:** Stay updated on new funding opportunities, application deadlines, and informational webinars.
    *   **Brief Example:** Attend a Chamber of Commerce meeting and strike up a conversation with someone who works at a local foundation. Ask them about their funding priorities and what they look for in grant applications.

    *   **Pro-Tip:** Don't be afraid to ask for help! Many grant providers offer free consultations to answer your questions and provide guidance on the application process.

*   **Grants.gov:** The official website for US federal grants; powerful search filters for specific needs.
*   **SBA.gov:** Small Business Administration resources, blogs, and links to programs.
*   **Local Chamber of Commerce:** Free networking and potential mentorship opportunities.
*   **LinkedIn:** Professional networking platform for connecting with grant managers and funded business owners.

I was a natural, and was thriving until one day I got sick. Permanent. Four years at the hospital for treatment later, I returned. 

I was sharper when I came back. I’d spent the four years on Elba (my parents basement) reading at the library, history, fiction, the canon etc. This combined with the iron forged through trauma and life difficulties made me a refined Napoleon-lite who had a clear idea of what to do and how to do it. I knew that more than anything I just needed to be in a room with powerful, influential people. They would see me, in my suits, hearing me speak with a level of intelligence, both emotional and otherwise, that never existed in my healthy life. I had changed. I was dangerous. 

It took one woman, one executive. She saw my potential and also showed a maternal concern for my well-being. She wrapped up our coffee and said “leave it with me.”

My whole life changed. Three days later she called me and simply said “you’re going to work for me.” A job was created for me and off I went, sizing up ways to put myself in positions where my overwhelming talent would be clear to all. More than anything I needed an audience. I suggested workshops for my boss to run, knowing full well it would be delegated to me, and would result in myself being in a role of prominence on a literal stage. Sure enough she organized one that had other executives from Wall St travelling for the day to take part. They all got to watch me on stage, speaking, teaching, exerting a command of the language not common for my position or age. Over the next few years I was promoted and moved to Wall Street.

As he crossed the small apartment towards the front door, she pulled out the juice and reached for a third cup out of the cupboard. Warren had mentioned Julie would probably be tired after driving so long, and she refused to assume she’d want coffee. That mistake had been made weeks ago, when Pepper came in after a double shift, utterly spent.

“I win!” Warren announced as he threw the door open emphatically.

“You’re hilarious,” a woman’s voice deadpanned from the hallway. “Now, c’mere and give me some lovin’, mister.”

Over Warren’s shoulder, Sararah caught a flash of red hair—Pepper’s exact shade, unmistakably inherited from her mother. She hadn’t known what to expect where Pepper’s mother was concerned, but everything about the woman who was being greeted with a hug and a kiss from her husband brought a smile to her lips. Part of her was highly tempted to join in on all that yummy loving, but Pepper would probably kill her.

As the two parted, Julie dropped a small backpack she was carrying out of the way and used Warren’s shoulder to support herself as she untied and pulled off her thick work boots. Their loss dropped her height a good inch, bringing the top of her head level with Warren’s eyes. “Much better.”

She offered her husband another chaste kiss, then moved around him to face Sararah.

Where Mr Cromwell was lean and sun-swept, Mrs Cromwell’s medium build lacked a suntan. Her red hair—tied back in a rough ponytail that gave her a real Sarah Connor vibe—matched the thick spread of freckles across her face. She still had creases around her eyes that signified a life on the road, but a lifetime in Miami had probably taught her to cover up when on the road for long periods of time. Apart from her boots, she was still in her hi-vis long-sleeve shirt and long pants with a side-strip of high vis and her sunglasses were hooked in the pocket of her shirt.

It was strangely beautiful that Sararah could see her friend’s thick, wild waves as a blend of them both, since Julie’s hair was so straight it was practically ironed into place. “And you must be Sarah,” she said, crossing the room with her arms outstretched. Sararah accepted the warm hug and then drew the woman’s attention to the glass and juice bottle still in her hands.

“Would you like a glass? It’s really good.”

“Grapefruit juice?” Julie asked with a squint after reading the bottle.

“I only get the sweet variety,” Sararah promised. “I’m not a fan of the bitter types.”

“Yes, then. Thanks. Can’t say I’ve ever had sweet before.”

“It’s not bad,” Warren said, coming up behind his wife to cuddle her from behind. “God, I’ve missed you, honey.”

“You know, if you need to, you two can always use my room for some sexy time,” Sararah suggested, tilting her head towards the hallway and nodding because yes, she absolutely meant that. The arousal in the room was so thick it had her practically salivating. “Not Pepper’s, though. She says the parent/child thing is like an international taboo or something—and she never wants to think about you two being together ever again…but mine is fine.” Better than fine. Sararah would feast on the aftermath of that much lust dripping off her sheets.

“We can wait until we get back to our apartment, thanks,” Warren said, as Julie’s mouth fell open in shock. He then turned his head towards Julie. “Pepper told us about Sarah’s occupation, remember?” he shot his wife a pointed look, and the things must have clicked because her eyes suddenly widened. “Not that there’s anything wrong with that, at all,” he added.

Sararah poured he drink and handed it over to Julie. “It’s okay,” she promised. “It was more if you wanted to. I’m not about to tell Pepper you had an itch to scratch. Oh, and if you’re worried about the linen, I don’t bring my johns or janes here. I usually go to their place.”

Warren laughed, and even Julie shook her head. “You’re quite the character, aren’t you, Sarah?”

“I try.”

Next thing, Baily purred at Julie’s feet, doing a figure eight through her legs.

“Bailey!” Julie cooed, dropping to one knee as the cat repeated his earlier rubbing performance all over again with Mrs Cromwell. Julie picked up the cat and held him close to her chest and throat. “Oh, I’ve missed you, you irritating furball.”

After Mr and Mrs Cromwell settled on the sofa with Bailey switching between laps as if he couldn’t decide which one he wanted (or more than likely flat out laying claim to both) Sararah dragged a kitchen stool closer to the coffee table to make the appearance of being included in the conversation.

“So, we’re both here now. Care to tell us exactly what our little girl has gotten herself into, Sarah?” Warren asked.

And after that, things went downhill fast.

Of course, Sararah tried offering them snacks as a distraction, and asking them about how their trips to the Big Apple had gone, and how they were coping now that Pepper wasn’t in Florida anymore, all the while side-stepping every question they had about what was going on with her and Pepper.

… and now they were down to simply staring at each other.

*Not awkward. At. All.*

“Ummm…I could put the TV on…” she suggested, hesitantly gesturing to the flat screen that sat on the wall to their left. “Pepper and I usually just swing the couch around if we want to watch.”

“No, we’re good, thanks,” Warren said, staring at her unnervingly.

“Okay. Ahhh…how about refills?” She jumped off the seat, eager to do … *something.* “I know I could…”

“Sarah, stop,” Julie said, and with those two words, Sararah came to a complete halt. “What are you so nervous about, girl?”

Sararah’s gaze bounced between the two of them. “You matter dearly to Pepper,” she said, rubbing her hands together before folding her arms defensively. “And … me and the whole concept of truth kinda parted ways a long time ago. In fact, we never really met, and my first instinct is to lie my pass off to you, and I’m trying really, *really* hard not to, but I don’t know what else to do.”

“You could try telling a single truth,” Julie suggested, unhelpfully. “Take that out for a spin and see what you think.”  

“I don’t want Pepper to get mad at me, either.” *Okay, that wasn’t so bad.*

“Because we’re Pepper’s parents and we matter dearly to her.”

“See? You get it.”

“No, I was just paraphrasing what you already said. But if us being Pepper’s parents is the problem, why don’t you pretend we’re yours instead?”

Sararah choked on her spit and had to cough to clear her airway. *Stupid human form.* “Yeah, that’s probably not the greatest idea either.” Three guesses who she learned all the ways of a succubus demon from?

Realising things were only getting worse, Sararah held up both pointer fingers and said, “I’m just going to make a quick phone call. Be right back,” she said, and bolted down the hallway into her bedroom before either of her guests could stop her. She slammed the door behind her and dove across her bed to snatch her phone from the far bedside table where she’d left it earlier.

Several requests for her company had already landed in her messages, but she wasn’t looking for a meal. Instead, she flipped open her Favourites and hit Pepper’s name. “C’mon … c’mon, c’mon,” she huffed impatiently.

\* \* \*

The task force operated on the most heavily surveilled level of 1PP, which was why Lucas and Pepper stood on one side of a sealed conference table while Inspector Nascerdios and Detective Quail faced them from the other.

The door to the right of Pepper and Lucas was locked and on the opposite side of the hallway to the task force. Like the glass windows into the task force, Daniel had covered the windows to this room as well. On the table between them were a pile of open files and a crime map linking Castillo and Young to other cases they’d worked where valuables went missing. More information was up on whiteboards along the hallway wall, where they wouldn’t ‘accidentally’ be seen from the door in the seconds that it was opening and closing.

“What do you need us for, sir?” Lucas asked, clearly mapping all the information in front of him.

Detective Quail placed her hand on the pile of files. “These are all the cases Castillo and Young worked over the last twelve months that went off without a hitch.” She moved her hand to a much smaller pile, consisting of five or six files. “These are the files that gave us enough to open a full investigation into those two.”

“May I?” Pepper asked, gesturing to the smaller pile.

Daniel nodded. “Go ahead. We also subpoenaed the original evidence chain relating to the Amsterdam robbery and the insurance that was paid out for it.”

“We also went to see the head of the HOA yesterday afternoon,” Lucas said, adding what he could to the case. “Mister Octavius Zimmermann. He’s a retired banker who lives in the building. He confirmed that every residence took an insurance hit because of the robbery, but the vases were only bought three days before. The following day, Mister Zimmermann told the Amsterdams that they had two weeks to move them off-site or the HOA would be citing them.”

Lucas retrieved his notebook and skimmed through his notes, making sure he didn’t get the details wrong. “And now that the robbery has happened, they’ve been cited with half a million dollars that the insurance for the building has gone up instead.”

“And it looks like the Amsterdams are trying to leave without anyone being any the wiser, rather than pay it—” Pepper’s words cut off with the ringing of her phone. She looked at who was calling, then glanced at the boss and muted it before pocketing it again. “Sorry. My roommate.”

“Take it outside,” Inspector Nascerdios ordered, flicking his chin towards the door. “Come back if it’s not important.”

Two days ago, Pepper would’ve questioned why he gave her permission to take the call. But then two days ago, although she had known her roommate was a demon, she hadn’t known the inspector was demonic royalty. He was clearly giving her the space to figure out whether the issue was mortal or divine—and if it were the latter, it would take precedence. *Barely.*

“Yes, sir,” she said, and headed into the hallway.

She could still feel the pulse of the call going through the fabric of her jacket and answered it once the door closed. “Sarah, I’m at work,” she growled into the phone.

“I know, but your parents are here, and I don’t know what to tell them!” Sararah hissed, just as quickly.

Of all the things her roommate could have said…

*“What?”* she barked, hoping that if Sararah repeated it, the words would come out differently.

“Your mom and dad are sitting on our sofa right now, petting Bailey and wanting to know what’s going on. What do I tell them? I mean, I could try and not say too much, and I could always fall back on the veil…”

“You are not whammying my parents with the damn veil,” Pepper snapped, storming a few paces away and returning. “Don’t you freakin’ dare.”

“Detective,” the inspector called from the doorway. A doorway Pepper knew damn-well she shut.

“Sir?”

“Tell her to tell them she was formally adopted into the Nascerdios family, and that although her name could legally be changed to Sarah Nascerdios, she doesn’t want to lose her original identity.”

*So much for going outside to take the call.* She refocused on her phone call. “Did you hear that, Sarah?”

“Yeah, I can do that. Come home as soon as you can. I still don’t like being left alone with them in case I say the wrong thing.”

“It’s barely two in the afternoon. I’ve got hours to go.”

“Try?”

“No promises.”

“Okay.”

Pepper pocketed the phone once more, but when she turned towards the door, the inspector wasn’t looking at her in annoyance. If anything, there was a hint of sympathy. He then kicked his head towards the room, much the way he’d sent her out. “Let’s get back to work, Cromwell.”

“Yes, sir.”

That’s what I said. Or something like it.
Knowing me, it was probably louder, meaner. I probably slammed the steering wheel for good measure, like the train would care.

I like to imagine I said something more poetic when it all began. Something that would sound good carved on a headstone, or at least look good on a screen if anyone ever finds this post. Something like “And so began the night that never ended.” But I doubt I did. I probably just sat there, muttering curses at a freight train that had no business being that long.

Funny, the things you remember and the things you don’t.
But that’s how it started. Just a guy in a car, waiting at a crossing for a train to pass. Nothing dramatic. Nothing special. Until it was.

I’ve been stuck in this… whatever you want to call it… for—
I don’t even know how long anymore. The clock on my dashboard froze at 11:48 p.m. the first night. Or what I think was night. It still is now. Same rain sliding down the windshield like it’s been looping on repeat. Same train, rattling along those tracks.

And me? I’ve gone from cursing to begging to just… talking into this little screen like someone might actually read this someday. So, yeah. If you’re reading this, congratulations. You’re on the outside. Keep it that way.

Because in here… there’s no outside. There’s only the train.

---

You probably want to know why I was out there that night. Why I left the city, drove two hours through pouring rain for a family dinner that I could've skipped with a simple text.

Truth? I wanted to make things right. Really make things right this time.

Not just to look better. Not to show up, smile, and let them think I was on the straight and narrow just long enough for them to slip me a helping hand—a few bucks to get me through a “rough patch”—before I disappeared again, crawling back into the same old cycle. I’ve done that before. Too many times.

But this time was different. I wasn’t chasing a bailout. I wasn’t looking for pity. I wanted to stand there and make them believe me when I said I’d changed—because I had to. Because if I didn’t, I wasn’t just going to lose them for good. I was going to lose myself for good.

Sarah wasn’t just my sister growing up—she was my best friend. Back when the world was small and safe, when the biggest fight we had was over who got the last Pop-Tart. We shared everything—secrets whispered in the dark, dumb inside jokes no one else would ever get.

And I loved her. God, I loved her. Always did. I just never knew how to show it.
My way of saying I care was… well, it was kid stuff. Switching the sugar in her cereal for salt. Stealing her diary so she’d chase me down the hall. Acting like an asshole when she brought home her first boyfriend because I didn’t know what else to do with the feeling that she might matter to someone else more than she did to me.

That was me. All swagger and no clue how to love without screwing it up.

And then I got older, and the stakes got higher. The drinking started—just a few beers to take the edge off, right? Then more. Then pills when the booze didn’t cut it. Before long, I was spiraling and lying to everyone about how fine I was, while Sarah kept showing up. Kept calling. Kept saying You’re not alone in this.

And every time she did, I hated myself more. Because I wanted to be better, but I didn’t want to need saving. I didn’t want to sit there with Mom looking at me like she’d failed somehow, or Dad trying to fix things with his tight-lipped silence, like if he didn’t talk about it, it might just go away.

I love them too—Mom with her casseroles and worried eyes, Dad with his hard hands and harder opinions—but every time I saw them, all I felt was shame. Like they were taking turns holding up a mirror I didn’t want to look into.

And the more they tried to help, the worse it got. Every phone call, every quiet intervention, every “we’re here for you”—it all just made me sink deeper. Because the more they cared, the smaller I felt. The smaller I felt, the more I drank. The more I drank, the more they cared. Round and round it went, until it wasn’t love anymore, not to me. It was a noose. A loop I couldn’t break.

Sounds familiar now. A track with no crossing, running circles around me.

But this time… this time was different.
I’d hit bottom hard a few weeks back. Hard enough to scare me sober. Hard enough to make me crawl out by my fingernails and swear I was done for good. For once, I wasn’t lying—not to them, not to myself. I was clean. Fragile, yeah. But clean. And I thought maybe, just maybe, I could make them believe in me again.

Especially Sarah.

---

So I drove down. Had dinner with Sarah and Mark—the guy I’ve barely spoken to since their wedding. Mom was there too, filling the kitchen with the smell of roast and cinnamon, just like when we were kids. The house hadn’t changed much. It was the one we grew up in, the one Dad left us when he passed. Sarah bought out my half after the funeral, and I told myself I’d use the money to start fresh. Instead, I burned through most of it on pills and powder, chasing numbness.

It was awkward at first, sure. All the smiles a little too tight, the jokes a little forced. But somewhere between the second round of coffee and Mom bringing out her famous apple crumble, the edges softened. We started laughing for real. Talking for real.

And for a while—just a little while—it felt like stepping back in time. Back before the drinking. Before the late-night phone calls and slammed doors. Back before the divorce. Back before Dad was gone for good. Just a family at the table, like nothing had ever cracked or broken.

Sarah was different, too. She didn’t say anything outright—she never does—but it was in the way she looked at me. Like maybe she believed me this time. Like maybe she felt the change before I even said a word about it.

And I felt it too. That quiet thread between us that used to be unbreakable, humming again. Stronger. I thought, this is it. This is the turning point. This time, I’m going to make it.

We didn’t talk about the past. Didn’t need to. Sometimes silence says more than all the words in the world.

When I left, she hugged me tight. Longer than she had in years. And I drove off thinking—for the first time in forever—that maybe the ground under me was finally solid.

Just a drive home.
Just a guy with a second chance, heading down a dark road, rain spitting on the windshield.

And then I stopped at those goddamn blinking red lights.

---

I sat there, watching them strobe against the rain-slicked road, painting everything in angry red. The crossing arms were already down when I rolled up, and the train was already thundering by—boxcar after boxcar, hissing and clanging through the dark.

At first, I didn’t think much of it. Just another train on another cold night. I drummed the wheel, scrolled through my playlists, tried to pretend the seconds weren’t stretching like rubber bands.

But they were.
Still going.
Boxcar after boxcar. No break in the line, just freight, rolling on and on like it had no place better to be.

That’s when the itch started. The one in the base of my skull. I’ve never been good at waiting. Not when there’s another option. Even a bad one.

So I threw it in drive, swung a U-turn, and headed for the back roads.

I knew these streets like the lines on my palm. Grew up out here, cutting through gravel lanes and narrow curves to shave five minutes off a bike ride. I figured I could chase the tail of the train, maybe find a crossing past the last car. Wouldn’t save me any real time, but at least I’d be moving. At least I’d feel like I had some control.

That was the plan. Just a little detour. Nothing more.

The road curved through dark fields, slick with rain, my wipers thudding slow against the glass. I told myself the next crossing couldn’t be far. The tail of the train had to be close by now.

I turned onto County Road 7, tires hissing over puddles, and then—there it was.
A smear of red in the distance, pulsing through the trees like a warning heartbeat.

The lights. Still flashing.

“Jesus Christ,” I muttered, slamming my palm against the wheel. I hit the brakes hard, felt the car skid a little before it caught. My jaw clenched. Screw this.

I threw it in reverse, cranking the wheel sharp until I was nosed back toward the main road. Gravel spat out behind me as I punched the gas and swung into an adjacent street, heading for the third crossing I knew was out past Miller’s Creek. A long shot, but at least it was something.

It was further than I remembered. Roads darker, narrower. The rain tapped steady against the glass as I wound through tight curves, headlights carving pale ribbons through the wet night.

By the time I saw the crossing ahead, my shoulders were knotted tight, and my teeth hurt from grinding them.

And then I saw it.
Those same red lights, glowing like the gates of hell, cutting through the dark.

Still blocked. Still going.

I pulled up close this time, killed the engine, let the wipers freeze mid-swipe. The train roared by, boxcars hammering the night. No end. No break. Just iron rolling forever.

Fine. Bite the bullet. Wait it out.

I sat back, exhaled hard, and finally let myself check the dash clock.
11:48.

My chest tightened. The numbers sat there, sharp and green, like they were carved into the screen. 11:48. Same as when I first hit the lights.

“What the hell…”

I slapped the plastic with my palm, harder than I meant to. The green digits flickered for a second, then settled right back into place. 11:48.

It made me think of Dad, back in his chair years ago, giving the old TV a quick tap on the side whenever the picture went fuzzy. Not a hard hit—just enough to make the static clear and the world snap back into focus. Somehow, it always worked for him.

Not this time.

For a second, I thought maybe I’d misremembered. Maybe I’d had a few too many drinks and time slipped past me without me noticing. God knows that’s happened before.

But then it hit me. I don’t drink anymore. Haven’t in weeks. Haven’t touched a drop since the last time I swore I was done.

So why the hell was it still 11:48?

I pulled my phone from my jacket, thumbed it awake, the glow harsh in the dark car.

11:48.

I opened up social.

Posts slid past under my thumb: video of a dog in a Halloween costume, someone’s new kitchen backsplash, a guy from high school humblebragging about his second rental property. Normal stuff. Comfortable stuff.

I kept scrolling. And scrolling.

After a while, the feed thinned out. Fewer posts, longer gaps. Then the spinning wheel, the little refresh chirp—
and nothing.

You’ve reached the end.

Huh.

I hit refresh. The screen blinked, then snapped back to where I’d started. Same golden retriever in a bumblebee suit. Same backsplash. Same rental property.

I frowned, flicked through again. Same thing. Again and again, like the whole world froze mid-scroll.

Signal bars were solid. Wi-Fi off. Data fine. Everything fine—
except nothing was changing.
Although the dog was cute, I grew tired of the same feed. And that realtor’s fake smile was starting to get under my skin. I locked the screen, slid the phone back into my pocket.

Screw it. I’d just double back to my sister’s place. Spend another half hour there before I tried the road again. Might as well.

I swung the car around and headed back the way I’d come. The rain whispered against the glass as I let myself drift down the old roads, the ones I hadn’t seen in years. A little trip through memory lane.

---

The park came first—the one with the crooked slide and rusted swing set. I slowed as I passed, staring through the wet blur at the dark silhouette of the jungle gym.

God, I hadn’t thought about that day in forever—me and Kyle, two idiots lying on the grass behind the equipment, trying mushrooms for the first time. I remembered stretching my hand out in front of my face, feeling the breeze against my palm every time I exhaled. Something so small, so ordinary, felt… incredible. Like proof I could make something happen, even if it was just moving the air.

We laughed until our ribs ached.

The road curved, pulling me past a neighborhood I used to know too well. I slowed a little, watching rows of dark houses blur through the rain.

Back then, I used to sneak into this place with people I called friends. We’d slip through the shadows, testing car doors, whispering like we were in some high-stakes heist instead of a couple of dumb kids in hoodies.

GPS units, loose change, the odd phone charger—whatever we could find. The plan was always the same: sell it all at school, make a quick buck, live large.

We never sold a single thing. Just ended up with glove-box junk rattling around under our beds like trophies.

Funny how quick you convince yourself it’s harmless. No one gets hurt. Everybody does it.

---

I pulled into the driveway. All the lights were off inside the house. No big deal. It was late—they were probably asleep by now.

I was about to throw it in reverse when my headlights slid across the car in the driveway.

I froze.

The beams crawled over metal that didn’t make sense—pitted, eaten through in patches like it had been sitting out for decades. The tires sagged flat, splitting at the seams. Rust bled across the doors like rot.

For a second, I wondered if I’d pulled into the wrong place. My stomach knotted as I checked the address on the house.

It was my childhood home. No doubt about it.

The white paint I’d seen not too long ago was curling away in strips, exposing gray, splintered wood beneath. Shingles sagged like loose scabs, some torn off entirely, leaving the roof raw and jagged.

I shoved the gear into park and stepped out.

The air smelled like wet earth—and something else. Something stale.

I moved around the front of the car, headlights throwing my shadow long across the yard. That’s when I saw the grass. It reached almost to my knees in places, bending heavy with water. Thick, tangled, and wild, like nobody had touched it in months.

A busted flowerpot lay by the steps, soil spilled out and washed thin. The welcome mat was still there, but its edges had curled and frayed, the lettering faded to a ghost of a word.

My stomach turned as I climbed the steps, each board groaning under my weight.

The door wasn’t locked. It gave under my hand with a tired sigh.

That’s when the smell hit me.

Rot and mildew, thick enough to coat the back of my throat. It felt alive, like the house was breathing it at me, pushing it into my lungs.

I stepped inside, the floor soft under my shoes, like the boards had been drinking the damp for years.

I moved farther in, the beam from the headlights slicing through the living room just enough to show shapes. The couch hunched under a film of gray, cushions sagging, fabric split along the seams.

Then I saw the table.

It was still set for dinner. Plates, glasses, silverware—all where we’d left them. Except now, the food was drowned in a shallow pool of murky water. The potatoes had shriveled to hard, wrinkled husks, their skin splitting like old parchment. Scattered across the table were chunks of meat, or what was left of them—rotting away in a state of quiet decay. A slick pinkish slime clung to the surface, dripping in slow threads down the edges of the plates, pooling on the table like diluted blood.

Maggots writhed in pale clusters, burrowing through soft tissue, shifting the meat as if feeding it life. From above came the faint, rhythmic patter of water trickling through the roof, each drop carving tiny craters into the dusty surface before spreading into the stagnant puddle below.

A drowned candle leaned against the edge of a cracked plate. Dust clung to everything like frost, soft and heavy. The warm scent of sweet cinnamon that once filled the room was gone, replaced by the musty stench of damp rot and spoiled flesh.

“Sarah?” My voice scraped out rough, too loud in the suffocating stillness. “Mark?”

Nothing.

Just the hush of an empty house swallowing my words like fireworks that never went off.


---

I don’t know how many days have passed. Feels like days, anyway. The sky hasn’t changed—still that starless black stretching over me like a lid. The rain hasn’t let up either, ticking against the windshield in the same slow rhythm, like time itself forgot how to move.

I’ve been driving. Circling the town, the backroads, the interstate on-ramps—every route I can think of. All of them feed me back to the same place: the tracks, the train grinding on, endless and indifferent.

Sometimes I swear I’m on roads that never had rails before—streets I know by heart—but there they are, steel lines cutting through the asphalt like scars.

Once, I left the car and started walking. Followed the train for what felt like hours, rain dripping down my collar, boots sucking in the mud. That’s when I saw it—places where the tracks tore straight through buildings. Houses split down the middle. Barns crumpled like cardboard. No detours, no hesitation. Just the line and the weight behind it, carving through everything like it had always been there.

Like it wasn’t following a map. Like it was making the world fit its path.

The gas gauge hasn’t budged. Not an inch. Same with the clock on the dash. Same with everything.

I’ve slept a couple of times—at least, I think I did—but it’s not the same as real sleep. My eyes close, I drift, then I’m awake again with no memory of dreams, no feeling of rest. I don’t get hungry. Don’t get thirsty. Maybe that’s a blessing.

I’ve tried calling—911, friends, family. The calls go through—rings and rings—but no one ever picks up. I even left voicemails, rambling, begging, threatening. Nothing. Not even a callback.

It’s like the world went silent and left me here to rot in the noise.

One night—or whatever you’d call it—I was parked in front of those damn blinking lights again. Just sitting there, watching them pulse like they were mocking me.

I had my phone in my hand, thumb scrolling out of habit. For what had to be the thousandth time, I watched Barker in that stupid little bumblebee costume. His ears poking through the striped hood, his tail wagging like a metronome.

I almost smiled. Almost.

Then something different happened.

A break.

Just for a second, like the train had stuttered—like its endless spine had a missing vertebra.

My heart slammed hard enough to make me dizzy.

I dropped the phone in my lap and leaned forward, squinting into the blur. Trying to track the end, to see if it was real or if my brain was just playing tricks.

I saw it. The end of this infernal machine, closely followed by its head, chasing its own tail like a dog.

After that, I couldn’t think about anything else.


---

I spent what felt like the next few days driving. Hunting. Looking for the perfect spot. A crossing with no trees creeping in from the sides, no buildings blocking the horizon. A stretch of open land where I could see the train coming from as far as possible.

Because now I knew what I had to do.

The gap was real. I saw it. I just needed to hit it at the right moment. Slide through that sliver of nothing and pray it spits me out somewhere that makes sense. Somewhere that isn’t here.

Every time I found a crossing, I parked. Watched. Counted cars until my eyes burned, memorized the rhythm like a hymn. Then moved on when the angle wasn’t right, when the sightlines weren’t long enough.

Day after day—if you can even call them that—me and those blinking red lights, trying to turn hope into math.

With each loop, I grew more familiar with my jailer. I knew its order, its colors, the texture of its passage. After the fifty-three cars of lumber came the graffiti of a devil, its horns curling across rusted steel like an omen scrawled in haste. Seventy-eight cars later, the gas tanks—white, bloated, and silent, carrying whatever fumes keep this world burning.

And then, after what felt like days, I saw it again—the gap. Barely twenty feet of open track, a narrow wound in the endless steel. Through it, I caught a glimpse of the horizon, a strip of light that didn’t belong in this endless night. But as soon as it came, the engine swallowed it whole, sliding forward like it was devouring the tracks ahead of it.

I started practicing. Over and over, timing the gap like it was a doorway that only opened for a breath. Each time it came, I slammed the accelerator, tires screaming against the asphalt, the wheel shuddering under my grip. My pulse would spike as the twenty feet of open track rushed toward me—freedom framed in steel.

And then the brake. Hard. Every muscle in my leg straining as the car shrieked and shuddered, stopping with only a few feet to spare before iron blurred past my windshield. The gap would vanish, swallowed by the engine that came sliding in like it was erasing my mistake.

I told myself I’d get it next time, but it’s hard to practice something you can only accomplish once. In the end, there’s no trick to it—just commit, jump into the abyss, and believe you’ll make it through.


---

I’m waiting for the next loop, writing this down like a memoir no one might ever read. The blinking red lights keep me company, strobing across the dashboard like a warning that never ends. The bell—its hollow chime cutting through the night, slow and steady, like a clock that only measures dread.

The white car with the skeleton graffiti.
Five hundred fifty-seven.

Sometimes I wonder—if I break the loop, could I go back? Back home, to laughter, to the sweet and savory warmth of the kitchen. Or would it still be what I saw last time—rot and mold, and a silence broken only by water dripping through the roof and the buzzing of flies?

The line of cargo draped in orange tarps.
Four hundred ninety-one.

The train roars on, endless as always. I tell myself this is the last time I’ll wait. The last time I’ll watch that gap open and close without me in it.

When I’m done, I’ll finish this post and send it. Watch the loading icon circle endlessly. While it does, I’ll wrap my phone in a sock, shove it into one of my shoes, and throw it over—across the tracks, to the other side of the train. If there’s still something out there, maybe my bottle will find a shore and deliver its message.

The giant rolls of sheet metal.
Four hundred twenty-four.

I know now that no one can save me. Even if they tried, it wouldn’t matter. I’m the only one who can do this—the only one who can make that decision.

Three hundred eighty-seven.

If this goes through, I want to leave this final note to my family.

Mom, I’m sorry—for all the restless nights, for every time you waited by the phone hoping I’d call, for every time I didn’t. You’ve always tried your best, more than anyone could ask for, and I didn’t. I could have been better. I could have worked on myself, but I didn’t. I let the weight of everything pull me under, and you didn’t deserve to pay the price for that. None of this was your fault. Not once. You loved me through every failure, and I wish I had loved myself enough to make that mean something.

Two hundred seventy-one.

Sarah, I’m sorry I never was the big brother you deserved—the big brother you needed. Every time you came to me for support, or just a shoulder to cry on, I turned it around and made myself the fragile one. I should never have done that. I should have been stronger, more mature, someone you could lean on instead of the other way around. But looking back now, I see the truth—I used you as a crutch to help me walk. And I regret it more than I can say.

Two hundred twelve.

And Dad… even though you’re gone, I hope you’re still watching. You raised a fighter, and I tried to live up to that, even when it didn’t look like it. Every time life knocked me flat, I heard your voice telling me to get back up, to never stay down, and somehow I always did. Maybe I didn’t win every fight, maybe I lost more than I care to admit—but I never quit. And I won’t now. Whatever’s on the other side of this… I’m going to face it head-on. I’ll keep moving forward, keep fighting through, no matter the cost.

One hundred twenty-two.

And to you, Mark. We never really talked much, and I never got to know you the way I should have. But from what I’ve seen, you’re a good man. Stay that way. Keep taking care of Sarah—she deserves someone solid in her corner. And hey… thanks for putting up with me.

Ninety-four.

If I don’t make it, I hope this train jumps the tracks when it hits me. I hope it rips itself apart and finally stops for good. Let the rails twist and shatter, let the whole damn machine collapse as it pulverizes me into paste. Because if I can’t get out, maybe at least I can stop it—so no one else ever has to ride this hell.

I gotta go now. The gap’s coming. Wish me luck.",4,1752803442.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

Smart washer/dryers were worthless, until I got one and now I can't live without it. Folding phones. WiFi 7 routers. Today I'm officially adding the Asus ROG Flow Z13 to that list, and by extension, integrated graphics cards. The gaming performance on display here is such that I can actually see a future where discrete graphics cards are obsolete. As someone who avoids iGPUs like the plague, this is a shocking turn of events. I wasn't expecting much, but what I experienced has changed the way I'll be playing PC games forever...

Disclaimer: This unit was loaned to me for review as part of the Asus For the Loyal Elite Program and will be returned upon the conclusion of the review period. My opinions are my own. As an aside, I would encourage everyone to check out the Asus Elite Rewards Program where you have the opportunity to earn points weekly to accumulate for gear, gift cards, games, etc. It's a pretty neat program [https://rog.asus.com/us/elite/activity/all](https://rog.asus.com/us/elite/activity/all)

**Unboxing / Hardware Overview**

I'll say one thing for Asus, they've really learned to nail down the unboxing experience. A nice, silver outer package gives way to 2 main boxes, one for the machine itself and one for the 200W power brick. Everything is neatly packed and wrapped in a glossy wrapper. The presentation here is outstanding. 

The first thing you immediately notice about this tablet/laptop is how robust it is. It weighs every bit the 2.6 lbs it's listed at, and this is shocking regardless of your perspective. If you go into it expecting a tablet, then WOW, this is heavy. If you go in expecting a laptop, then WOW, this is really light. Either way, the fully aluminum chassis is pretty breathtaking. There's an RGB-laden window on the rear of the device to give it that lighting flare we gamers crave

There's a full-length kickstand at the bottom of the device with a neat, flush tab for easy extension, and it sits on some of the most robust hinges I've ever seen. Under the kickstand is the accessible port for the M2 drive, making swapping it out a simple matter with no full disassembly required. 

https://preview.redd.it/zlz80qklcjdf1.jpg?width=8160&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=45d74753267eeecbbc436b40576a1351fccf0517

I thought I would hate the included keyboard when I first saw it because it looked thin and uninspired. Then I tried it and I'm 100% sold on it. It's a chiclet style keyboard with a magnetic pogo connector and the entire thing folds up neatly over the screen. There's even RGB backlighting, which is great for use in darker environments. All I'll say about the keyboard is don't knock it until you've tried it. I found typing on it to be pretty excellent and it's just about perfect for gaming (VERY short-throw keys...).

As for I/O you have a pretty complete suite here. There's a 3.5mm combo audio jack, a full size HDMI 2.1 port, a 10gb USB 3.2 port and dual USB-C/Thunderbolt 4 ports which both support Displayport and power delivery (huge). There's also a microSD card reader slot and the proprietary Asus charging port they started using in 2025 for the 200W power charging. Finally, there's a dedicated button which is used to call up the Armoury Crate software or indeed anything else you'd like to configure it to do. It's a neat touch, as is the recessed power button which I did not once ever hit inadvertently.

There are dual cameras here, a 13mp rear camera and a 5mp IR front camera which indeed supports Windows Hello. I found logging in via the camera definitely a hit or miss affair, but that has little to do with the camera itself and more to do with how Microsoft implements it (I have issues with my desktop machine occasionally as well). The rear camera is interesting. I didn't think I'd ever use it until I was sitting outside one day and my dog was doing something utterly stupid. No phone in sight, so it was the Flow Z13 to the rescue. Pretty handy...

On the audio side there are 4 speakers present, and I'm VERY happy to report that Asus keeps their tradition of supporting Dolby Atmos here, complete with the full license. Sound quality from these \*small\* speakers is surprisingly good. Definitely passable for gaming and they get plenty loud, but don't expect audiophile quality here, they're just not big enough. The audio jack also supports Hi-Res audio, which is GREAT to see. I'll also mention that this laptop has a 3 microphone array with noise cancelling, and in-game it worked surprisingly well. 

There's WiFi 7 onboard, which for me is pretty neat as I happen to have a WiFi 7 setup. Speeds are...insane. Being able to download games at a 1.9Gbps clip tends to spoil you pretty quickly... *PROTIP: don't waste 45 minutes trying to figure out why you can't connect to your WiFi 7 network until/unless you've installed Windows update 24H2, which apparently enables WiFi 7 support :/*

There's a 13.4 inch 2.5K display here, which Asus insists is a Nebula display. Now, I have an Asus Nebula display on my gaming laptop (Scar 18). It's mini-led and I'm on record as saying it's every bit as good as, if not superior to, OLED and is one of the most breathtaking displays I've ever seen. The display here is...not that one. It's very nice, has a 180hz refresh rate and is a touch screen, but it's neither mini-led nor OLED. It's what they call an ""IPS-level"" display. What this means is that you will see backlight bleed, you will have only a handful of dimming zones and the brightness peaks at 500 nits. Definitely superior to a lot of laptop displays, but when Asus throws around the ""Nebula"" brand I admit I am spoiled and was a bit disappointed here because I know what a true ""Nebula"" display is capable of

Further, the display does indeed support Dolby Vision (and HDR in general)...**but only for video.** It's a really odd thing. Movies and streaming content display DV/HDR (depending on source) just fine, but HDR/DV is completely invisible to all games. I've researched this extensively and it's a design choice on the part of Asus, not a driver or firmware issue. 

Ok finally let's talk about the chipset and cooling. The special sauce here is the AMD Ryzen AI MAX+ 395. It's a ridiculous name (bad) with ridiculous performance (great). More on this in a bit.

There's a unified memory architecture here, with the memory allocated to the GPU adjustable within settings depending on your overall RAM configuration. My unit had 32GB total memory, and after playing around with dedicating 8GB and 16GB to the GPU I settled on 8GB. You can, however, buy this device with 64GB and even 128GB of unified memory and tweak the GPU allocation accordingly.

The cooling is handled by the ""usual"" suite of Asus performance hardware. Vapor chamber? Check. Thermal Grizzly liquid metal paste? Check. Amazing throughput from the cooling fans with dust filters? Also check. They have a formula for success here, and Asus have executed it to perfection once again. The exhaust fans are at the top of the display, which is a pretty great solution for this form factor as it spews the heat completely away from you and whatever surface you're perched on. If you want to have this on your lap (awkward but definitely possible) you don't have to worry about heat cooking your legs whatsoever.

**Gaming Performance**

This is the reason we're all here, and I am thrilled to report that the Flow Z13's gaming performance absolutely shocked me. At a minimum it's on par with an RTX 4060 laptop GPU. In some games it actually outperformed an RTX 4070 laptop. In Manual mode (everything maxed) at default 2560x1600 resolution with all settings maxed and FSR 3 Quality enabled (where available) I was getting minimally 60fps on all of the games I typically play and in most cases far higher. No RT, no frame gen, just pure fps glory. Halo Infinite, Black Ops 6, Forza Motorsport, The Last of Us Part I, God of War, Baldur's Gate 3, Cyberpunk 2077. Turn on frame generation and/or switch to FSR balanced and get 100fps in games like Cyberpunk on max settings? Yes please...On and on, game after game the performance floored me. And again, I cannot stress this enough, these were all at max graphical settings and 1600p. If you're willing to compromise and lower the settings, resolution and/or switch the power profile to something like Performance or Silent, you can absolutely 100% game completely on battery here and it will be the best battery gaming experience you've ever had. For an iGPU to hit nearly 11k in Time Spy is just wild to me

https://preview.redd.it/xjwuk5b8djdf1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c80f4be58ec8dfb798d16a943ebe3176b9b2a0b

[Black Ops 6](https://preview.redd.it/y7sri85bdjdf1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=440741bf62b873cd3384a77dd13f10b41c8bb66c)

Now these results are obviously going to vary with different games and in different environments. I personally tried to test this laptop in extreme settings (outdoors in 90 degree heat) and achieved the above consistently. The thing is, at no time did I ever experience thermal throttling in these admittedly ridiculous conditions. Fans were loud-ish, sure, but no throttling. When cooler heads prevailed (literally) and I was inside in a 67 degree air conditioned room, performance was the same level of insanity but the fans didn't need to work nearly as hard. 

**Battery Life and Fan Noise**

I'm not one to game while on battery, but the portability here just screams to do just that. The newly overhauled Armoury Crate software (new and improved, seriously) is onboard of course, and you tweak the power profile here based on what you're looking for out of the device for each session. The default for battery mode for the 70wh battery is Silent, which for regular everyday use + video watching gave me between 6 and 8 hours of screen time. Again, it's the duality of this product at play. As far as a laptop goes, 6-8 hours of battery is fantastic. Compared to a tablet, 6-8 hours of battery is terrible. As far as fans go, Silent mode certainly lives up to its name as the fan noise barely went above a whisper throughout.

Gaming on battery is a different affair entirely. In silent mode (which adjusts screen brightness, power draw and fan profiles accordingly) I got about an hour and a half entirely on battery (native resolution, max settings). Cranking up to Performance mode increases the burn rate significantly (while of course increasing performance accordingly) and drops you down to about an hour, while switching to Turbo puts you at roughly 45 minutes. Just understand that when you're exclusively on battery you're obviously not going to be tapping into the full power of the iGPU so game performance is going to be throttled down accordingly.

[Forza Motorsport on Battery](https://preview.redd.it/ztoorp9idjdf1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=f871d5068722bcff669e5eaadac0fbd0f2be5417)

BUT, there's a solution here thanks to the two onboard USB power delivery ports. A cheap, smallish 100W power bank lets you game in Performance, Turbo and even Manual mode (with all metrics maxed out) for 2-3 hours pretty easily with no drop in gaming performance. You'll still drain the battery of course (you need the full 200W brick to actually charge while gaming), but it's a really neat minimalist option to have when you're out and about with no outlets in sight. Fan noise cranks up accordingly, however, and there were times when I was outside on a hot day gaming at max performance and the fans were pretty loud. Not deal-breakingly loud (they're small fans after all), but still definitely noticeable. You can certainly tweak this in AC, but understand that with great power comes great responsibility. And noise. 

**Downsides**

The screen and its 180hz refresh rate kept up with everything wonderfully. It's bitterly disappointing however that HDR/Dolby Vision isn't supported in games as I've grown to become something of a snob with this aspect of gaming these days. It was still a very pleasant visual experience and the ""IPS level"" display is quite good (especially for a touch screen). Nevertheless, it's just a REALLY odd choice, Asus...

Another downside and the elephant in the room with the Flow Z13 is onboard storage. It comes with an M2 slot. This is great. It's a 2230 slot. This is terrible. The only shipping option here is a 1TB drive, which I managed to completely saturate within the first 30 minutes (onboard WiFi 7 FTW!!!). The thing is, because it's the stupid 2230 form factor, you're limited to just 2TB even if you upgrade. As someone who has 2 (TWO) 8TB 2280 drives in his Scar 18, the lack of any real storage option here is criminal and will be a serious bottleneck if you're buying this for gaming. 100GB games are pretty standard, and in the case of stuff like Black Ops 6, well, it's a SERIOUS problem. Again, the WiFi 7 mitigates this somewhat, but still...

**Conclusion**

I never thought I'd see the day when an iGPU could be a viable gaming platform, yet here we are. To say I've had a blast playing games on this machine is an understatement. The portability to performance ratio is insane and I have actually taken this laptop to places I wouldn't dream of taking my Scar 18. Barbecues, coffee shops, the DMV (yeah...). To be able to play AAA games with maxed out graphics on a 2lb device is just wild to me. To be able to take that same laptop and seamlessly bring it to the library for work/school or to put it into my gym as a touchscreen for my live training programs is beyond wild, it's a paradigm shift. One thing I didn't even mention (and won't, I'm a gamer after all) is how powerful this chipset is at productivity tasks like Davinci Resolve. It beats my desktop i13700k in 4k rendering...

AMD really hit it out of the park with the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 chipset here, and Asus added their manufacturing superiority to create the ultimate do-everything device. It's a zero-compromise ""gaming machine+"" in the perfect form factor

One of the things I could understand potential buyers struggling with when considering the Flow Z13 is the use case. If you want a tablet you'd probably buy a dedicated tablet. If you want a gaming handheld you'd probably buy that. If you want a gaming laptop or a work laptop you'd buy those. I was like these people and I never even considered the Flow Z13 before this review. After using it as my everyday device for the past 3 weeks, however, I can't imagine anyone considering anything else. It's basically perfection as the ultimate truly portable PC gaming system that happens to be a tablet. Just, Asus, please, for the next iteration ditch the 2230.

Baltimore suffocated under an unrelenting deluge, the rain a gray curtain that bled the city’s colors into a haze of wet asphalt and flickering neon. Detective Miles Corbin stood outside a derelict warehouse in Locust Point, his trench coat soaked through, clinging to his broad frame like a mourner’s veil. His face was a ravaged landscape—high cheekbones shadowed by graying stubble, hazel eyes sunken beneath a furrowed brow, silver-streaked dark hair matted under a dripping fedora, his tie a wrinkled afterthought flapping in the wind. The warehouse loomed, its rusted corrugated walls streaked with rain, grimy windows dark save for a faint, sickly glow from within, like the flicker of a dying bulb. Police lights slashed through the mist, painting the cracked asphalt in jagged streaks of red and blue, while officers secured the perimeter, their yellow slickers ghostly against the storm’s churn.  
  
Inside Corbin’s mind, a vision flickered—not his own, but a shadow of the killer’s. A man, cloaked in darkness, stood in a barren room, his silhouette lean and taut, his eyes distant, burning with an otherworldly focus. Flashes of horror pierced the scene: a woman’s scream choked off by a brutal hand, her face twisted in terror; a man’s blood pooling on a cold concrete floor, his eyes wide with guilt; a child’s face, pale and haunted, trapped in a cage of human cruelty. The visions were sharp, visceral, revealing the hidden sins of the killer’s targets—rape, murder, trafficking—crimes buried beneath polished facades of respectability. The man moved with eerie precision, guided by these glimpses, his hands steady as he planned his next act, his presence a wraith slipping through the world’s blind spots. Corbin blinked, the image dissolving into the rain, leaving only the weight of his obsession and a chill that wasn’t from the storm.  
  
Back at the precinct, the forensic lab had cracked the silver thread from Hensley’s studio. Corbin met Dr. Helen Carver in her sterile office, its walls lined with anatomical charts and humming microscopes, the air sharp with the bite of chemicals and bleach. Carver, wiry and tense, her graying bob tucked behind her ears, stood by a lab table, her green eyes glinting behind wire-rimmed glasses as she held up a report. Her lab coat was crisp, but her hands trembled slightly, betraying the strain of the case.  
  
“It’s not fabric,” Carver said, her voice low, almost a whisper over the hum of equipment. “It’s a synthetic fiber, military-grade, used in stealth gear—think covert ops, black-market stuff. And there’s a trace chemical compound, some kind of lubricant or coating, obscure as hell. This isn’t something you’d find in an art gallery.”  
  
Corbin’s pulse quickened, his coat dripping onto the linoleum, leaving dark splotches. “So, the killer’s got access to specialized gear. That’s a lead.”  
  
“Barely,” Carver said, her lips a thin line. “This stuff’s untraceable, off-the-grid. But it’s deliberate, Miles. They’re not sloppy—this was left for us to find. Either a mistake or a taunt.”  
  
Corbin nodded, his mind racing. A synthetic fiber, a locked room, a killer who moved like a phantom. He stepped into the squad room, a chaotic hive of ringing phones and shouted orders, rain streaking the windows like veins of liquid silver. His murder board was a shrine to his unraveling—photos of Jenkins, his stern silver hair soaked in blood; Vance, her poised elegance marred by bruises; Sterling, his dignified calm shattered by cracked ribs; and Hensley’s empty studio, marked by a single silver thread. He pinned up a new note: Synthetic fiber. Military. Intentional.  
  
He gathered his team—Officer Riley, his freckled face ghostly pale, blue eyes wide with nervous energy, sandy hair damp under his cap, and Detective Sarah Lopez, her dark hair in a tight ponytail, brown eyes sharp behind her navy blazer, silver hoop earrings glinting under the fluorescent lights. They stood by the board, the air thick with tension, the hum of the precinct a constant drone.  
  
“New lead,” Corbin said, holding up the forensic report, its pages crisp despite the damp. “The thread from Hensley’s scene—military-grade fiber, rare, deliberate. The killer’s leaving us something. And Lopez, your dig into the victims is paying off.”  
  
Lopez straightened, her voice cautious but edged with excitement. “Yeah, it’s ugly. Jenkins had a sealed lawsuit—sexual assault, dropped a decade ago, victim paid off. Vance was tied to a charity that smells like money laundering, whispers in high circles. Sterling had a malpractice claim, hushed fast, but there’s talk of botched surgeries, patients silenced. Nothing prosecutable, but they’re not saints.”  
  
Corbin’s stomach twisted, the pieces clicking into a dark mosaic. “Hensley?” he asked, turning to Riley.  
  
Riley flipped through his notebook, his hands shaking slightly. “A collector accused her of selling forgeries, threatened to ruin her. Case died quietly—money changed hands, I bet. There’s a pattern, Detective—hidden sins, buried deep.”  
  
Corbin jabbed the board, his voice low, gravelly. “That’s the why. These people were monsters, hiding behind their reputations. The killer knows their secrets—how, I don’t know, but they’re targeting them for it.”  
  
Lopez crossed her arms, her eyebrow arched. “You’re saying this is justice? A vigilante with a god complex, picking off the guilty?”  
  
“I’m saying they’re not killing for kicks,” Corbin shot back, his tone sharp with fatigue. “It’s personal, but it’s bigger—punishment, not murder.”  
  
Riley hesitated, his voice barely above a whisper. “But how, Detective? Locked rooms, no struggle, no trace—except this fiber. It’s like they’re not human. Like they… see things we don’t.”  
  
Corbin’s eyes narrowed, Riley’s words echoing the vision that had haunted him. “Maybe they do,” he said, his voice low. “Lopez, chase the fiber’s origin—black markets, military surplus, anything. Riley, cross-reference the victims’ pasts for more dirt. We need the thread that ties them.”  
  
Lopez sighed, tossing her pen onto the desk with a clatter. “You’re obsessed, Miles. You’re seeing patterns where there’s just chaos. This killer’s a ghost, not a judge.”  
  
“Then prove me wrong,” Corbin said, his voice hard. “Find me the how, and I’ll find the why.”  
  
Riley nodded, scribbling furiously, but Lopez shook her head. “This is gonna break you, Miles. You’re too deep in.”  
  
“Then let it,” Corbin muttered, turning back to the board. Their voices faded as he stared at the photos, patterns swirling in his mind—real or imagined, he couldn’t tell. The violence was too precise, too ritualistic, like a sermon in blood he couldn’t decipher.  
  
  
  
Later, Corbin met Dr. Emily Weiss in the precinct’s conference room, a stark box reeking of stale coffee and damp carpet, its fluorescent lights buzzing like a swarm of flies. Weiss, in her fifties, her silver hair cropped short, sat across from him, her gray suit crisp, blue eyes studying him over her glasses. Case files were stacked between them, their edges curling like old wounds.  
  
“The fiber’s a game-changer,” Weiss said, her voice deliberate, her pen tapping the file rhythmically. “It’s a taunt, or a rare mistake. This killer’s profile is sharpening—highly intelligent, disciplined, with access to elite tools. The intimacy of the kills, the lack of struggle, points to absolute control, maybe psychological manipulation. They’re not just executing—they’re enacting a ritual, driven by a belief in their mission.”  
  
Corbin leaned back, his chair creaking, his coat still damp, leaving a puddle on the floor. “A mission? Like what?”  
  
Weiss’s eyes narrowed, her voice steady. “Something ideological, possibly spiritual. They see themselves as an agent of justice, targeting those the law failed. The fiber could be their way of saying, ‘I’m real, but you’ll never touch me.’ They’re proving their power—to themselves, or to us.”  
  
Corbin rubbed his temples, the lights drilling into his skull. “So, we’re chasing a zealot who thinks they’re untouchable.”  
  
“Exactly,” Weiss said, closing her file with a snap. “And they’re damn good at it.”  
  
Corbin thanked her and returned to his office, spreading the crime scene photos across his desk—Jenkins’ blood-soaked shirt, Vance’s bruised throat, Sterling’s shattered ribs, Hensley’s empty studio. The forensic report lay beside them, the silver fiber’s chemical profile a cryptic riddle: synthetic, military, untraceable. He traced the photos, his fingers trembling with exhaustion, the victims’ sins a dark thread weaving through their lives.  
  
That evening, Corbin visited a retired detective, Frank Malone, who’d worked Jenkins’ old assault case. Malone lived in a sagging rowhouse in Hampden, its brick facade peeling, its stoop slick with rain, flanked by wilting geraniums in cracked pots. Malone was in his sixties, grizzled, with a white beard and tired gray eyes, his flannel shirt rumpled, a cigar smoldering in an ashtray. They sat in his cluttered living room, the air thick with smoke and the musty scent of old books, a single lamp casting long shadows.  
  
“Jenkins was a snake,” Malone said, his voice rough, sipping whiskey from a chipped glass. “That assault case—young woman, scared witless, paid to disappear. I pushed to nail him, but the brass shut it down. Too much money, too many connections.”  
  
Corbin’s pen scratched, his notepad damp. “Anyone else involved? Someone who’d hold a grudge, maybe enough to kill?”  
  
Malone shrugged, exhaling a cloud of smoke. “Plenty hated Jenkins—business rivals, scorned partners. But no one stood out. Case was buried deep, like it never happened.”  
  
“Anyone… unusual?” Corbin pressed, his voice low. “Someone who didn’t fit, who seemed… off?”  
  
Malone’s eyes narrowed, his fingers pausing on the glass. “There was a guy, years back, came to the precinct. Quiet, intense, asked about Jenkins’ case. Said he ‘knew things.’ We brushed him off—thought he was a crank. Never saw him again.”  
  
Corbin scribbled mystery man, his pulse quickening. “Description?”  
  
“Tall, lean, dark hair. Eyes like he saw ghosts. Didn’t leave a name.” Malone leaned back, his chair creaking. “You think he’s your guy?”  
  
“Maybe,” Corbin said, his mind spinning. He thanked Malone and stepped into the rain, lighting a cigarette, its glow faint in the dark. The smoke curled, swallowed by the storm. A hushed lawsuit, a strange visitor, a synthetic fiber—it was thin, but it was building. The killer was choosing monsters, and somehow, they knew their sins.  
  
That night, in his sparse apartment, Corbin sat at his kitchen table, case files a chaotic sprawl under a flickering bulb. The room was bleak—peeling paint on the walls, a sagging couch with frayed upholstery, a fridge that groaned like a dying beast. Laura’s photo sat on the coffee table, her smile a fading ghost of better days. He pushed it aside and opened the forensic report, his eyes fixed on the chemical profile: rare, military, untraceable. The TV blared, a news anchor’s voice slicing through the static: “The ‘Locked Room Murders’ paralyze Baltimore, with a killer who defies all logic…”  
  
Corbin lit another cigarette, the smoke curling like a wraith. His dreams were haunted by the killer’s visions—flashes of guilt, blood, and betrayal. The victims were monsters, their sins exposed by a shadow who moved through locked doors, unseen, unstoppable. Corbin felt the world tilting, the line between reality and madness dissolving with every unanswered question, the silver thread a fragile lifeline to a truth he wasn’t sure he wanted to face.  
  
  
chapter 5.  
  
Baltimore groaned under a torrential rain, the city a sodden tapestry of wet brick and flickering neon, its streets gleaming like black mirrors under the storm’s unyielding assault. Detective Miles Corbin stood outside a decaying tenement in Sandtown. The tenement loomed, its brick facade pocked and crumbling, windows boarded with warped plywood or shattered into jagged maws, a faint, sickly glow leaking from a cracked pane on the third floor. Police lights slashed through the mist, painting the slick pavement in jagged streaks of red and blue, while officers secured the alley, their yellow slickers ghostly in the downpour, their boots splashing in puddles that reflected the chaos.  
  
Inside, Corbin’s mind churned with the shadow of Elias Thorne, a name clawed from the depths of old case notes and Malone’s hazy recollection—a reclusive figure, no digital footprint, no record, yet tied to whispers of Jenkins’ buried assault case. Corbin had tracked him here, to this rotting husk of a building, its decay a jarring contrast to the pristine crime scenes that haunted him. The air in the tenement was thick with mildew and despair, the stairwell creaking under his boots, its walls scrawled with graffiti—curses and cryptic symbols in faded spray paint, like the ravings of a mad prophet. Flickering fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting long, wavering shadows that danced like specters.  
  
Corbin reached the third floor, his flashlight cutting through the gloom, its beam glinting off peeling paint and exposed pipes. The door to apartment 3B hung ajar, its frame splintered, the rusted lock dangling like a broken tooth. Inside, the room was a study in desolation—a sagging mattress on a rusted frame, a splintered wooden chair, a single bare bulb swinging from a frayed cord, casting a sickly yellow glow. Elias Thorne stood by the window, his silhouette lean and taut, dark hair falling in unkempt strands over pale, intense eyes that seemed to pierce the veil of reality. He was in his thirties, wiry, dressed in a plain black coat that hung loosely on his frame, his hands steady, his gaze distant, as if seeing beyond the rain-soaked city to a truth only he knew.  
  
“Elias Thorne,” Corbin said, his voice gravelly, hand resting on his holster, the cold metal grounding him. “Baltimore PD. Step away from the window. We need to talk.”  
  
Thorne turned slowly, his eyes locking onto Corbin’s, unblinking, like a predator assessing its equal. His face was angular, almost gaunt, with a faint scar tracing his left cheek, barely visible in the dim light. “Detective Corbin,” he said, his voice soft, almost reverent, a whisper that cut through the rain’s drone. “You found me. I knew you would.”  
  
Corbin stepped inside, his coat dripping onto the warped floorboards, the air heavy with the scent of damp rot. “Three dead, one spared,” he said, his tone hard. “Jenkins, Vance, Sterling—brutal, clean, impossible. Hensley got lucky. You’re the ghost I’ve been chasing, and I’m done running.”  
  
Thorne’s lips twitched, not a smile but a flicker of recognition, his eyes glinting like polished obsidian. “A ghost? No, Detective. I’m flesh and blood. You see the pattern, but not the truth. You’re close, though. Closer than anyone.”  
  
Corbin’s jaw tightened, his pulse quickening. “Explain it. How’d you get in? No forced entry, no struggle, no trace—except that fiber. Military-grade, left like a damn calling card.”  
  
Thorne stepped closer, his movements fluid, deliberate, his boots silent on the creaking floor. “The fiber was a gift, Detective. A thread to pull, to bring you here. You’re asking how, but you should ask why.”  
  
Corbin’s grip tightened on his gun, his mind flashing to the crime scenes—Jenkins’ blood-soaked shirt, Vance’s bruised throat, Sterling’s shattered ribs, Hensley’s empty studio with that single silver thread. “Why, then? What ties them? Why these people?”  
  
Thorne’s gaze softened, almost pitying, his voice a low murmur, like a prayer in the dark. “I see them, Detective. Their sins. Their hands drip with blood—rape, murder, children stolen and sold into shadows. The law failed them, but I don’t. The visions show me their crimes, guide me through locks, past guards, into their hearts. They deserve their ends, and I deliver them.”  
  
Corbin’s stomach twisted, Thorne’s words echoing the dark truths Lopez had unearthed—sealed lawsuits, hushed accusations, buried crimes. “Visions?” he said, his voice sharp, skeptical, but shaken. “You’re saying you’re what—a prophet? God’s executioner?”  
  
“Not God,” Thorne said, his eyes burning with quiet fervor. “Truth. The visions show me their guilt—every scream, every tear, every life they broke. They show me how—through walls, through locks, unseen, untouched. It’s not skill, Detective. It’s purpose. Divine or not, I don’t question it.”  
  
Corbin’s breath caught, the moral weight crushing him. He saw the victims’ sins—Jenkins’ assault, Vance’s laundering, Sterling’s malpractice, Hensley’s forgeries—but Thorne’s certainty was a blade, slicing through his faith in the law. “You’re confessing to murder,” he said, his voice unsteady, cuffs glinting in his hand. “You don’t get to play judge.”  
  
Thorne’s gaze held steady, unyielding. “You’ve seen their files, haven’t you? Jenkins’ victim, silenced with money. Vance’s charity, a front for trafficking. Sterling’s patients, dead under his knife. Hensley’s lies, ruining lives for profit. You know I’m right. Why do you fight it?”  
  
Corbin’s hand trembled, the cuffs cold against his palm. “Because it’s not justice. It’s vengeance. You’re under arrest.”  
  
Thorne didn’t resist, his hands rising slowly, his eyes never leaving Corbin’s. “You’ll lock me away, but the truth won’t die. Others will see it, Detective. You already do.”  
  
  
  
At the precinct, the squad room was a maelstrom of chaos, phones ringing, officers shouting over the clatter of keyboards, the air thick with the scent of burnt coffee and damp wool. Rain battered the windows, blurring the city’s neon glow into a kaleidoscope of despair. Corbin stood by his murder board, now a relic of his obsession—photos of Jenkins, his stern silver hair soaked in blood; Vance, her poised elegance marred by bruises; Sterling, his dignified calm shattered by cracked ribs; Hensley’s empty studio, marked by a silver thread. A new name was scrawled in red: Elias Thorne. He gathered his team—Officer Riley, his freckled face ghostly pale, blue eyes wide with shock, sandy hair damp under his cap, and Detective Sarah Lopez, her dark hair in a tight ponytail, brown eyes sharp behind her navy blazer, silver hoop earrings glinting under the fluorescent lights.  
  
“He confessed,” Corbin said, his voice low, hoarse, his coat dripping onto the floor. “Not to murder, not exactly. Says he sees visions of their crimes—rape, murder, trafficking. Claims they guide him, show him how to kill without a trace. The fiber, his presence—it’s all deliberate.”  
  
Lopez crossed her arms, her voice sharp, edged with disbelief. “Visions? He’s delusional, Miles. A psychopath with a god complex, dressing up murder as justice.”  
  
Riley shifted, his voice hesitant, barely audible over the precinct’s din. “But the victims… their pasts. You said it yourself—they were guilty. Jenkins’ assault, Vance’s laundering, Sterling’s malpractice, Hensley’s forgeries. What if he’s… right?”  
  
Corbin’s eyes narrowed, Riley’s words a mirror to his own doubts, gnawing at his core. “Right or not, he’s a killer. We’ve got the fiber, his confession, his presence in that tenement. It’s enough to close it.”  
  
Lopez tossed her pen onto the desk with a clatter, her eyebrow arched. “Enough for what, Miles? The media’s already sniffing out the victims’ secrets. When this breaks—Jenkins’ assault, Vance’s trafficking ties—it’ll be a circus. The city’s on edge, and this’ll light the fuse.”  
  
“Let it burn,” Corbin snapped, his tone harder than he meant, his hands clenching into fists. “We did our job. He’s in custody.”  
  
Riley looked down, his voice soft. “But what if he’s telling the truth? About the visions, I mean. How’d he know their sins? How’d he do it—locked rooms, no trace?”  
  
Corbin didn’t answer, his mind tangled in Thorne’s words, the impossible kills, the victims’ hidden guilt. He turned to the board, the photos staring back, accusing, their sins a dark thread weaving through his resolve.  
  
Later, Corbin met Lieutenant Dan Hargrove in his office, a cramped space with yellowed walls and a flickering bulb, papers strewn across a battered desk. Hargrove’s bulldog frame filled the room, his buzz-cut head gleaming, his small eyes burning with frustration, his suit rumpled from endless hours. “You got him,” Hargrove said, his voice gruff, sipping coffee from a chipped mug. “Thorne’s in holding. But this is a goddamn mess, Corbin. The victims’ secrets are leaking—Jenkins’ assault, Vance’s laundering, Sterling’s malpractice, Hensley’s forgeries. The mayor’s livid, says it’ll tank public trust.”  
  
Corbin rubbed his stubble, his coat leaving a puddle on the floor. “Thorne knew their sins, Dan. Targeted them for it. He’s not just a killer—he’s a reckoning, or thinks he is.”  
  
Hargrove’s scowl deepened, his jowls quivering. “Don’t go philosophical on me, Miles. You caught him. That’s what matters. But the press is gonna eat us alive. Get ready for hell.”  
  
Corbin nodded, but the victory was ash in his mouth. He visited Dr. Emily Weiss in her office, a stark room with bookshelves crammed with psychology texts, a single lamp casting long shadows across a worn rug. Weiss, her silver hair cropped short, sat across from him, her gray suit crisp, blue eyes studying him over her glasses, case files stacked neatly on her desk.  
  
“Thorne fits the profile,” Weiss said, her voice calm, deliberate, her pen tapping rhythmically. “Delusional, but disciplined. He believes he’s an instrument of justice, guided by visions or intuition. The fiber, the clean scenes, the targeted victims—it’s all part of his ritual, his proof of a higher purpose.”  
  
Corbin leaned back, his chair creaking, his coat still damp. “He’s not delusional,” he said, his voice low. “The victims were guilty. He knew things we didn’t—things buried deep. How?”  
  
Weiss’s eyes narrowed, her voice steady. “That’s the danger, Miles. He’s charismatic, convincing, pulling you into his narrative. Don’t let him. He’s a killer, not a savior.”  
  
Corbin said nothing, her words a cold splash against his doubts. He thanked her and stepped into the rain, lighting a cigarette, its glow faint in the dark. The smoke curled, swallowed by the storm, Thorne’s words echoing: The visions show me their crimes, guide me through locks, unseen.  
  
That night, in his sparse apartment, Corbin sat at his kitchen table, case files a chaotic sprawl under a flickering bulb. The room was bleak—peeling paint, a sagging couch with frayed upholstery, a fridge that groaned like a wounded beast. Laura’s photo sat on the coffee table, her smile a fading ghost of better days. He pushed it aside and stared at Thorne’s booking photo, his pale eyes burning through the paper, a quiet intensity that chilled Corbin’s blood. The TV blared, a news anchor’s voice slicing through: “The ‘Locked Room Murders’ solved, but shocking revelations about the victims spark outrage, raising questions about justice and vengeance…”  
  
Corbin lit another cigarette, the smoke curling like a wraith. Thorne was behind bars, but his truth—his visions, his justice—gnawed at Corbin’s soul. The victims were monsters, their sins exposed by a phantom who moved through locked doors, unseen, unstoppable. Corbin had solved the case, but the victory was hollow, his faith in the law fractured, the line between good and evil dissolving in the rain-soaked dark, leaving him adrift in a world where truth was as slippery as the city’s wet streets.  
  
  
chapter 6.  
  
Baltimore lay battered under an unrelenting rain, the city a drenched mosaic of wet brick and stuttering neon, its streets shimmering like black glass under the storm’s ceaseless hammer. Detective Miles Corbin stood outside the Baltimore City Detention Center. The detention center loomed, a squat fortress of gray concrete, its barred windows glinting dully under floodlights, the air thick with the scent of wet asphalt and institutional despair. Police lights flickered in the distance, their red and blue pulses fading into the mist, while guards in slickers patrolled the perimeter, their boots splashing through puddles that mirrored the city’s gloom.  
  
Inside, Elias Thorne sat in a holding cell, his lean frame still, his pale eyes fixed on some unseen horizon. Corbin’s mind churned with the killer’s words—visions of sins, justice delivered through locked doors, a purpose that defied logic. The case was closed, Thorne in cuffs, but the truth gnawed at Corbin, a splinter under his skin. He’d seen the victims’ files—Jenkins’ buried assault, Vance’s trafficking ties, Sterling’s malpractice, Hensley’s forgeries—but Thorne’s certainty, his impossible method, haunted him like a ghost that wouldn’t rest.  
  
Corbin entered the detention center, the air heavy with bleach and rust, the fluorescent lights buzzing like a swarm of flies. He met Thorne in an interrogation room, a stark cube with a steel table bolted to the floor, a one-way mirror reflecting Corbin’s haggard face. Thorne sat across from him, wrists cuffed, his black coat replaced by an orange jumpsuit, his dark hair falling over his angular face, the faint scar on his cheek catching the light. His eyes, pale and piercing, held a quiet intensity, as if he saw beyond the walls to a truth Corbin couldn’t grasp.  
  
“You’re locked up, Thorne,” Corbin said, his voice gravelly, his coat dripping onto the concrete floor. “Case closed. But I need answers. How’d you do it? The locked rooms, the clean scenes, the fiber—how?”  
  
Thorne leaned forward, his cuffs clinking, his voice soft, almost intimate. “You still ask how, Detective, when you should ask why. The visions showed me their sins—Jenkins’ victim, broken and paid off; Vance’s children, sold for profit; Sterling’s patients, dead by his hand; Hensley’s lies, ruining lives. They guided me, through locks, through shadows, to their hearts. The fiber was my gift to you, a bridge to this moment.”  
  
Corbin’s jaw tightened, his pulse hammering. “Visions don’t break physics, Thorne. You’re not a prophet—you’re a killer. Tell me how you got in, how you left no trace.”  
  
Thorne’s lips twitched, a flicker of something—not a smile, but a knowing. “The truth doesn’t bend to your rules, Detective. The visions are real. They show me the way—past doors, past guards, past reason. I don’t question them. I act.”  
  
Corbin slammed his fist on the table, the sound echoing. “You’re delusional. You killed three people, nearly a fourth. You don’t get to hide behind visions.”  
  
Thorne’s gaze held steady, unyielding. “And you don’t get to hide behind your badge. You’ve seen their files, their sins. You know they deserved it. Why does it scare you?”  
  
Corbin’s breath caught, Thorne’s words a blade through his doubts. He saw the victims’ guilt, their crimes buried by wealth and power, but justice wasn’t this—a phantom with a knife. “You’re under arrest for murder,” he said, his voice unsteady. “That’s the truth I know.”  
  
Thorne leaned back, his eyes softening. “Lock me away, Detective. The truth will outlast these walls. You feel it already, don’t you? The weight of their sins, the failure of your law.”  
  
Corbin stood, his hands trembling, and left the room, Thorne’s words trailing him like smoke. Outside, the rain battered the city, a relentless dirge.  
  
At the precinct, the squad room was a tempest of chaos, phones ringing, officers shouting over the clatter of keyboards, the air thick with burnt coffee and damp wool. Rain streaked the windows, blurring the city’s neon into a smear of despair. Corbin stood by his murder board, a monument to his unraveling—photos of Jenkins, his stern silver hair soaked in blood; Vance, her poised elegance marred by bruises; Sterling, his dignified calm shattered by cracked ribs; Hensley’s empty studio, marked by a silver thread; and Thorne’s booking photo, his pale eyes burning through the paper. He gathered his team—Officer Riley, his freckled face ghostly pale, blue eyes wide with unease, sandy hair damp under his cap, and Detective Sarah Lopez, her dark hair in a tight ponytail, brown eyes sharp behind her navy blazer, silver hoop earrings glinting under the fluorescent lights.  
  
“He confessed,” Corbin said, his voice hoarse, his coat leaving a puddle on the floor. “Says he sees visions of their crimes—rape, murder, trafficking. Claims they guide him, show him how to kill without a trace. The fiber was intentional, a lure to draw us in.”  
  
Lopez crossed her arms, her voice sharp with disbelief. “Visions? He’s insane, Miles. A psychopath dressing up murder as divine justice. You’re not buying this, are you?”  
  
Riley shifted, his voice hesitant, barely audible over the precinct’s din. “But the victims… their pasts. Jenkins’ assault, Vance’s trafficking, Sterling’s malpractice, Hensley’s forgeries. He knew things we didn’t. How?”  
  
Corbin’s eyes narrowed, Riley’s words a mirror to his own turmoil. “He’s a killer, Riley. Delusional or not, we’ve got the fiber, his confession, his presence in that tenement. It’s enough.”  
  
Lopez tossed her pen onto the desk with a clatter, her eyebrow arched. “Enough for what? The media’s tearing us apart. The victims’ secrets are out—Jenkins’ assault, Vance’s trafficking ties. The city’s in an uproar, saying Thorne’s a hero. This is a PR nightmare.”  
  
“Let it burn,” Corbin snapped, his tone raw with exhaustion. “We did our job. He’s in custody.”  
  
Riley looked down, his voice soft. “But what if he’s right? Not about killing, but… the victims. They were guilty. What if the system failed?”  
  
Corbin’s fists clenched, his voice low. “The system’s all we’ve got, kid. Thorne’s not the answer.”  
  
Lopez shook her head, her voice softer now. “You’re too deep in, Miles. This case—it’s changed you. You’re seeing ghosts.”  
  
Corbin didn’t answer, turning to the board, the photos staring back, their sins a silent accusation. The victory felt like ash, Thorne’s words a poison in his veins.  
  
Later, Corbin met Lieutenant Dan Hargrove in his office, a cramped cave with yellowed walls and a flickering bulb, papers strewn across a battered desk like fallen leaves. Hargrove’s bulldog frame filled the room, his buzz-cut head gleaming, his small eyes burning with frustration, his suit rumpled from endless hours. He sipped coffee from a chipped mug, his voice gruff. “You got him, Corbin. Thorne’s in holding. But this is a shitstorm. The victims’ secrets are everywhere—Jenkins’ assault, Vance’s trafficking, Sterling’s malpractice, Hensley’s forgeries. The mayor’s screaming, says it’ll destroy public trust.”  
  
Corbin rubbed his stubble, his coat dripping onto the floor. “Thorne knew their sins, Dan. Targeted them for it. Says he saw their crimes in visions, that they guided him through locked doors. He’s not just a killer—he thinks he’s justice.”  
  
Hargrove’s scowl deepened, his jowls quivering. “Visions? Christ, Miles, he’s a nutcase. You caught him—that’s what matters. But the press is calling him a vigilante hero. We’re drowning in this.”  
  
Corbin nodded, the weight of it crushing him. He visited Dr. Emily Weiss in her office, a stark room with bookshelves crammed with psychology texts, a single lamp casting long shadows across a worn rug. Weiss, her silver hair cropped short, sat across from him, her gray suit crisp, blue eyes studying him over her glasses, case files stacked neatly on her desk.  
  
“Thorne fits the profile,” Weiss said, her voice calm, deliberate, her pen tapping rhythmically. “Delusional, but disciplined. He believes he’s an instrument of justice, guided by visions or intuition. The fiber, the clean scenes, the targeted victims—it’s all part of his ritual, his proof of a higher purpose.”  
  
Corbin leaned back, his chair creaking, his coat still damp. “He’s not delusional,” he said, his voice low, strained. “The victims were guilty. He knew things we didn’t—things buried deep. How does a man like that know?”  
  
Weiss’s eyes narrowed, her voice steady. “That’s his power, Miles. He’s charismatic, convincing, pulling you into his narrative. He’s a killer, not a savior. Don’t let him blur the line.”  
  
Corbin said nothing, her words a cold slap against his doubts. He thanked her and stepped into the rain, lighting a cigarette, its glow faint in the dark. The smoke curled, swallowed by the storm, Thorne’s words echoing: The truth will outlast these walls.  
  
That night, in his sparse apartment, Corbin sat at his kitchen table, case files a chaotic sprawl under a flickering bulb. The room was bleak—peeling paint, a sagging couch with frayed upholstery, a fridge that groaned like a dying beast. Laura’s photo sat on the coffee table, her smile a fading ghost of better days. He pushed it aside and stared at Thorne’s booking photo, his pale eyes burning through the paper, a quiet intensity that chilled Corbin’s blood. The TV blared, a news anchor’s voice slicing through: “The ‘Locked Room Murders’ solved, but revelations about the victims’ crimes spark outrage, raising questions about justice and vengeance…”  
  
Corbin lit another cigarette, the smoke curling like a wraith. Thorne was behind bars, but his truth—his visions, his justice—gnawed at Corbin’s soul. The victims were monsters, their sins exposed by a phantom who moved through locked doors, unseen, unstoppable. Corbin had solved the case, but the victory was hollow, his faith in the law shattered, the line between good and evil dissolving in the rain-soaked dark, leaving him adrift in a world where truth was as elusive as the city’s fleeting shadows.",1,1752803035.0,HorrorTalesCommunity,0,1.0,False

The rain pounded Baltimore, a merciless gray shroud that turned the city into a labyrinth of slick pavement and flickering neon. Detective Miles Corbin stood outside a gated estate in Roland Park, his trench coat sodden, clinging to his broad shoulders like a second skin. The estate loomed before him, a Tudor mansion with stone walls and leaded-glass windows, its gabled roof cutting jagged lines against the storm. Ivy snaked up the facade, glistening like oil, while police lights slashed through the mist, painting the gravel driveway in hues of blood and ice.  
  
Inside, Dr. Robert Sterling, a 60-year-old surgeon celebrated for his precision and free clinics, lay dead in his fortified home office. Corbin pushed through the wrought-iron gate, nodding to Officer Riley, whose freckled face was ghostly under his rain-soaked cap, his blue eyes wide with unease, his sandy hair plastered to his forehead.  
  
“Another one, Detective,” Riley said, his voice trembling over the rain’s relentless drum. “It’s… it’s just like Jenkins and Vance. Worse, maybe.”  
  
Corbin’s jaw clenched, his breath fogging in the cold. “Show me, kid.”  
  
They crossed the threshold into a grand foyer, where a crystal chandelier cast fractured light across marble floors veined with gold. The air was heavy with the scent of old books, antiseptic, and a faint metallic tang that set Corbin’s nerves on edge. A spiral staircase, its oak banister carved with twisting vines, led to the second-floor office. The room was a shrine to Sterling’s meticulous nature: floor-to-ceiling oak shelves packed with medical journals, a steel desk bare except for a fountain pen and a single glass of scotch, and a leather armchair that screamed understated wealth. Sterling’s body slumped against the desk, his white dress shirt ripped open, exposing a chest brutalized by blunt-force trauma—bruises spreading like storm clouds, ribs cracked into jagged lines beneath pale skin. His face, once sharp and distinguished with a neatly trimmed gray beard, was frozen in a grimace of pain, his brown eyes staring blankly at the coffered ceiling. Blood trickled from his mouth, pooling on the polished hardwood, yet the room was immaculate—no overturned books, no scattered papers, no sign of a struggle.  
  
Dr. Helen Carver knelt beside the body, her wiry frame tense, her graying bob tucked behind her ears. Her green eyes, sharp behind wire-rimmed glasses, scanned the wounds with clinical precision, though her tight lips betrayed unease. “Same pattern,” she said, her voice clipped. “Blunt force, close range, delivered with controlled fury. No defensive wounds, no weapon, no forced entry. The security system was armed, door double-locked from the inside.”  
  
Corbin crouched, his knees popping, his coat dripping onto the floor. His eyes traced the room—windows sealed, heavy drapes undisturbed, alarm panel blinking green. “How the hell does someone do this?” he muttered, his gaze settling on Sterling’s hands, unmarked, resting limply on the desk. “It’s like they walked through the damn walls.”  
  
Carver peeled off her gloves, her brow furrowing. “Ghost or not, they’re consistent. Third clean scene, Miles. No blood spatter beyond the body, no trace evidence. It’s unnatural.”  
  
“Unnatural’s putting it mildly,” Corbin said, standing. His fingers itched for a cigarette, but he resisted, the sterile air of the room choking him. “This isn’t just clean. It’s impossible.”  
  
Carver’s lips twitched, a grim half-smile. “Tell that to the laws of physics.”  
  
In the hallway, Lieutenant Dan Hargrove was pacing, his bulldog frame filling the narrow space, his buzz-cut head gleaming under the recessed lights. His suit was rumpled, his small eyes burning with frustration. “Corbin, this is a goddamn nightmare,” he growled, his voice bouncing off the wood-paneled walls. “Three bodies, three locked rooms, and you’ve got squat. The mayor’s chewing my ass, and the media’s calling it the ‘Locked Room Murders.’ What’s your angle?”  
  
Corbin rubbed his stubble, his coat dripping onto the floor. “It’s a pattern, Dan. Close-quarters, brutal, but no trace. No struggle. It’s like the victims just… let it happen.”  
  
Hargrove’s scowl deepened, his jowls quivering. “You’re saying they didn’t fight? Three people, all high-profile, just sat there and took it?”  
  
“I’m saying it doesn’t make sense,” Corbin snapped, his voice sharp with fatigue. “No defensive wounds, no mess. The killer’s in their face, personal, but leaves nothing behind. It’s not a hitman. Hitmen don’t linger like this.”  
  
Hargrove crossed his arms, his bulk blocking the light. “Then what, Miles? A vigilante? A psycho with a vendetta?”  
  
“Maybe,” Corbin said, but his gut twisted. “It feels… deliberate. Like a message we’re not reading.”  
  
“Get me something concrete,” Hargrove barked. “The city’s panicking, and I’m not explaining ‘deliberate’ to the press.”  
  
Corbin nodded, his mind churning. He stepped outside, the rain biting his face, and lit a cigarette, the flame flickering in the wind. The estate’s lawn stretched into the darkness, its manicured hedges sculpted into perfect arcs, the gravel crunching under his boots. The smoke curled upward, swallowed by the storm. Three murders, three locked rooms, three impossibly clean scenes. It was wrong, all wrong.  
  
Back at the precinct, Corbin’s office was a claustrophobic cave, its walls plastered with faded memos and coffee stains. The murder board loomed, a chaotic web of photos, red strings, and scribbled notes. Jenkins’ stern face, Vance’s poised elegance, and Sterling’s dignified calm stared back, their lifeless eyes accusing. He pinned up Sterling’s photo—his gray beard neat, his expression twisted in pain—and scrawled: No connection. No motive. No evidence. Precision.  
  
The squad room buzzed, a cacophony of ringing phones and shouted orders. Rain streaked the windows, blurring the city’s neon glow. Corbin gathered his team—Riley, his freckles stark against his pale face, and Detective Sarah Lopez, her dark hair in a tight ponytail, her brown eyes sharp behind her navy blazer. She leaned against a desk, arms crossed, her silver hoop earrings glinting under the fluorescent lights.  
  
“Three victims,” Corbin said, jabbing the board. “Jenkins, businessman. Vance, socialite. Sterling, surgeon. No overlap in their lives, no shared enemies, no obvious motive. The M.O.—close-quarters, violent, clean as a lab. Ideas?”  
  
Lopez tapped her pen against her chin, her voice measured. “Could be a vigilante. Someone targeting high-profile types for a reason we’re missing. The precision screams intent, Miles. It’s not random.”  
  
Corbin shook his head, his coat dripping onto the floor. “If it’s intent, it’s personal. These aren’t drive-bys. The killer’s in their face, but leaves nothing behind. That’s not just skill—it’s… something else.”  
  
Riley shifted, his voice hesitant. “What if it’s psychological? Someone who gets off on the control, the intimacy of it? Like, they’re proving they can get that close and walk away clean?”  
  
Corbin’s eyes narrowed, considering. “Maybe. But why no struggle? No defensive wounds? It’s like they’re paralyzed, or…” He stopped, the word willing hanging in the air, too absurd to voice.  
  
Lopez snorted, her eyebrow arched. “You’re not seriously suggesting they wanted to die, Miles. That’s insane.”  
  
“I’m suggesting we’re missing something,” Corbin said, his voice sharp. “These kills are too perfect. Dig into their lives—deep. Financials, old cases, rumors. If there’s a reason they were chosen, it’s buried.”  
  
Lopez sighed, tossing her pen onto the desk. “You’re chasing shadows, Miles. The killer’s method is the key, not the victims. Focus on how they’re doing this, not why.”  
  
“Both matter,” Corbin shot back, his tone harder than he intended. “We’re blind until we know why these people. Riley, canvass Sterling’s neighbors. Lopez, tear apart his professional life—every patient complaint, every lawsuit, every whisper.”  
  
Riley nodded, scribbling in his notebook, but Lopez rolled her eyes. “You’re obsessed, Miles. This isn’t going to be in their pasts. It’s in the killer’s head.”  
  
“Then prove me wrong,” Corbin said, turning back to the board. Their voices faded as he stared at the photos, patterns flickering in his mind—imagined or real, he couldn’t tell. The violence was too deliberate, too precise, like a ritual he couldn’t decipher.  
  
  
  
Later, Corbin met with Dr. Emily Weiss, the department’s profiler, in a cramped conference room that smelled of stale coffee and mildew. Weiss was in her fifties, her silver hair cropped short, her gray suit as no-nonsense as her demeanor. Her blue eyes studied Corbin over a stack of case files, her glasses perched on her nose.  
  
“This killer’s unique,” Weiss said, her voice calm but deliberate, her pen tapping the file. “The intimacy—close-quarters, hands-on—suggests a deep connection to the act. But the absence of trace evidence, the locked rooms… it’s almost performative. They want us to notice the impossibility.”  
  
Corbin leaned back, his chair creaking, his coat still damp. “So, what are we looking at? A psychopath with a magic trick?”  
  
Weiss didn’t smile, her eyes narrowing. “Someone highly controlled, intelligent, with an obsessive need for perfection. The lack of struggle could mean they establish trust or dominance before the kill. They’re not just killing—they’re executing, with a purpose we don’t see yet.”  
  
Corbin’s stomach twisted. “Executing” felt right, but it didn’t explain the how. “Any chance this is personal? Like, they knew the victims?”  
  
“Possible,” Weiss said, adjusting her glasses. “But the lack of connection between victims suggests it’s not personal in the traditional sense. It’s more… ideological. They’re proving something—to themselves, or to us.”  
  
Corbin rubbed his temples, the fluorescent lights buzzing overhead. “So, we’re chasing someone who thinks they’re untouchable.”  
  
“Exactly,” Weiss said, closing her file. “And they’re good at it.”  
  
He thanked her and returned to his office, spreading the crime scene photos across his desk. Jenkins’ blood-soaked shirt, Vance’s bruised throat, Sterling’s shattered ribs—all up close, all personal, all clean. He traced the edges of the photos, his fingers trembling with fatigue. The rain outside was a constant drone, mirroring the static in his mind.  
  
That evening, Corbin visited Sterling’s chief nurse, Margaret Cole, at her modest rowhouse in Canton. The street was narrow, lined with brick homes, their stoops slick with rain. Cole was in her late forties, her blonde hair pulled back, her face lined with worry. She stood in her doorway, a cardigan wrapped around her thin frame, the warm light of her living room spilling out.  
  
“Detective Corbin,” she said, her voice soft but steady. “I saw the news. Dr. Sterling… it’s awful.”  
  
“I need to know about him,” Corbin said, his notepad damp in his hand. “Anything unusual? Enemies, odd behavior?”  
  
Cole shook her head, her eyes distant. “He was a saint. Saved countless lives, especially at his free clinics. Everyone loved him.”  
  
“Everyone?” Corbin pressed, his voice gentle but firm. “No complaints? No rivals?”  
  
She hesitated, her fingers twisting the edge of her cardigan. “Well… there was one thing. A patient, years ago, made accusations—malpractice, I think. It was hushed up, dropped. I never believed it. Dr. Sterling was meticulous.”  
  
Corbin jotted down malpractice with a question mark. “Anything else? Strange visitors, calls?”  
  
“Nothing,” she said, her voice firm. “He was private, kept to himself outside work.”  
  
Corbin thanked her and stepped back into the rain, his cigarette glowing faintly in the dark. A hushed accusation wasn’t much, but it was a thread, thin and fraying. He needed more.  
  
That night, in his sparse apartment, Corbin sat at his kitchen table, the case files a chaotic sprawl under a flickering bulb. The room was stark—peeling paint, a sagging couch, a fridge that groaned like a dying beast. Laura’s photo sat on the coffee table, her smile a fading memory. He pushed it aside and opened Sterling’s file, his eyes scanning the details: locked door, no weapon, no struggle. The TV blared, a news anchor’s voice slicing through: “The ‘Locked Room Murders’ grip Baltimore, with no suspects and a city in fear…”  
  
Corbin lit another cigarette, the smoke curling like a specter. He stared at the files, the victims’ faces blending into one. The killer was out there, moving through the rain, unseen, untouchable. And Corbin, for the first time in his career, felt the world slipping out of his grasp, the rules of logic bending under the weight of something he couldn’t name.  
  
  
  
chapter 3.  
  
Baltimore drowned under a relentless downpour, the rain a gray veil that smeared the city’s edges, turning its brick rowhouses and neon signs into ghostly shadows. Detective Miles Corbin stood on a quiet street in Mount Vernon, his trench coat soaked through, clinging to his broad frame like a shroud. His face was a weathered map of exhaustion—high cheekbones shadowed by graying stubble. The townhouse before him was a narrow, three-story relic of old wealth, its sandstone facade pocked by rain, its arched windows glowing faintly against the storm. Police lights pulsed, painting the wet cobblestones in streaks of red and blue, while officers cordoned off the sidewalk, their yellow slickers stark against the gloom.  
  
Inside, Corbin had arrived just in time—a potential victim, Margaret Hensley, a 42-year-old art gallery owner, had narrowly escaped death. A last-minute change of plans had kept her out of her locked studio, the killer’s intended “kill zone.” Corbin trudged through the oak-paneled foyer, the air thick with the scent of turpentine and aged wood. Officer Riley met him at the door, his freckled face pale under his rain-soaked cap, blue eyes darting nervously, sandy hair matted to his forehead.  
  
“She’s shaken, Detective,” Riley said, his voice low over the rain’s steady drum. “Says she was supposed to be here, but a client called her out last minute. Lucky break.”  
  
“Lucky,” Corbin muttered, his jaw tight. “Show me the room.”  
  
The studio was on the third floor, a loft with slanted ceilings and skylights rattling under the storm. Canvases lined the walls, their abstract swirls of color muted in the dim light. A wooden easel stood in the center, a half-finished painting streaked with violent reds. The room was pristine—no signs of forced entry, no scuff marks on the hardwood, but Corbin’s eyes caught something: a faint, almost imperceptible shimmer on the floor near the easel. He crouched, his knees creaking, and squinted—a single, fine thread, no thicker than a spider’s silk, glinting silver in the light. It didn’t belong, not in this sterile space. He signaled a tech to bag it, his gut twisting with the first hint of something tangible.  
  
Dr. Helen Carver arrived, her wiry frame bundled in a raincoat, her graying bob tucked behind her ears. Her green eyes, sharp behind wire-rimmed glasses, scanned the room. “No body this time,” she said, her voice dry. “But the setup’s the same. Locked door, no signs of a break-in. If she’d been here, she’d be like the others—brutal, close-up, clean.”  
  
Corbin stood, his coat dripping onto the floor. “This thread,” he said, pointing. “It’s something. It shouldn’t be here.”  
  
Carver raised an eyebrow. “You’re pinning hopes on a thread? That’s new.”  
  
“It’s all we’ve got,” Corbin snapped, his voice sharper than intended. He felt the cases pressing on him, each one a weight dragging him deeper into the dark.  
  
Downstairs, Margaret Hensley sat in her living room, a high-ceilinged space with velvet drapes and a marble fireplace. She was striking—tall, with sharp cheekbones and jet-black hair swept into a loose bun, her gray eyes wide with shock. Her silk blouse was wrinkled, her hands trembling as she clutched a mug of tea. Corbin sat across from her, his notepad damp in his hand.  
  
“Ms. Hensley,” he began, his voice gentle but firm. “I’m Detective Miles Corbin. You’re lucky to be alive. Tell me what happened.”  
  
She swallowed, her voice shaky. “I was supposed to work late in the studio. I always lock the door—it’s habit. But a client called, needed me to meet them downtown. I left at seven. When I got back, I saw a man leaving.”  
  
“Anyone know your plans?” Corbin asked, his pen scratching. “Anyone who might’ve expected you to be here?”  
  
She shook her head, her fingers tightening on the mug. “No one. I don’t advertise my schedule. The studio’s my sanctuary.”  
  
“Enemies? Threats?” Corbin pressed, his eyes searching her face.  
  
“None,” she said, her voice firm but strained. “I run a gallery, Detective. My world is art, not… this.”  
  
Corbin jotted no enemies with a question mark, his mind racing. He thanked her and stepped outside, the rain cold against his face. He lit a cigarette, the smoke curling into the storm, his eyes fixed on the townhouse’s glowing windows. A near miss, a thread—small, but something. The killer had slipped, just barely.  
  
  
Back at the precinct, Corbin’s office was a claustrophobic tomb, its walls stained with coffee rings and yellowed memos. The murder board was a chaotic shrine—photos of Jenkins, Vance, Sterling, and now a note for Hensley, marked survivor. Their faces haunted him: Jenkins’ stern silver hair, Vance’s poised elegance, Sterling’s dignified calm. He pinned up a new note: Thread. Silver. Foreign. The board was a tangle of red string and pushpins, a map of his obsession.  
  
The squad room hummed with chaos, phones ringing, officers shouting over keyboards. Rain streaked the windows, blurring the city’s neon glow. Corbin gathered his team—Riley, his freckles stark against his pale face, and Detective Sarah Lopez, her dark hair in a tight ponytail, brown eyes skeptical behind her navy blazer. She leaned against a desk, her silver hoop earrings catching the fluorescent light.  
  
“Three kills, one miss,” Corbin said, jabbing the board. “Jenkins, Vance, Sterling—dead. Hensley, alive, by dumb luck. Same M.O.—locked rooms, close-quarters, clean. Except now we’ve got this.” He held up the evidence bag with the silver thread, its faint shimmer catching the light.  
  
Lopez crossed her arms, her voice sharp. “A thread, Miles? That’s your breakthrough? Could be from anything—her clothes, a canvas.”  
  
“It’s not hers,” Corbin said, his tone low. “It’s too fine, too… strange. And it was right where the killer would’ve stood.”  
  
Riley piped up, his voice hesitant. “What if it’s deliberate? Like, the killer’s taunting us? Leaving a clue to mess with us?”  
  
Corbin’s eyes narrowed. “Or they slipped. Either way, it’s something. Lopez, get it to forensics—priority. Riley, keep digging into Hensley’s life. I want to know why she was targeted.”  
  
Lopez sighed, tossing her pen onto the desk. “You’re still chasing the victims, Miles. The killer’s method is the key. How are they getting in and out?”  
  
“Because the why tells us who,” Corbin shot back, his voice edged with frustration. “These aren’t random. The killer’s choosing them for a reason. Find it.”  
  
Lopez rolled her eyes. “You’re obsessed. This is going to break you.”  
  
“Then let it,” Corbin said, turning back to the board. Their voices faded as he stared at the photos, patterns flickering in his mind—real or imagined, he couldn’t tell. The violence was too precise, too ritualistic, like a code he couldn’t crack.  
  
  
  
Later, Corbin met with Dr. Emily Weiss in the precinct’s conference room, a stark space reeking of stale coffee and mildew. Weiss, in her fifties, her silver hair cropped short, sat across from him, her gray suit crisp, her blue eyes studying him over her glasses. Case files were stacked between them, their edges curling.  
  
“This killer’s evolving,” Weiss said, her voice calm but deliberate, her pen tapping the file. “The near miss with Henlsey suggests they’re not infallible. But the method—intimate, controlled, clean—points to someone with an obsessive need for perfection. The thread could be a mistake, or it could be intentional, a signature.”  
  
Corbin leaned back, his chair creaking, his coat still damp. “A signature? You think they want us to find it?”  
  
“Possibly,” Weiss said, her eyes narrowing. “They’re performing. The locked rooms, the absence of struggle—it’s a display of power. They’re proving they can get close, kill, and vanish. The thread might be their way of saying, ‘Look closer.’”  
  
“So, what are we dealing with?” Corbin asked, rubbing his temples. “A genius? A madman?”  
  
“Both,” Weiss said, closing her file. “Someone highly intelligent, disciplined, with a purpose they believe in. The lack of defensive wounds suggests control—either psychological or physical. They’re not just killing; they’re judging.”  
  
Corbin’s stomach twisted. “Judging” felt right, but it didn’t explain the impossible. He thanked Weiss and returned to his office, spreading the crime scene photos across his desk—Jenkins’ blood-soaked shirt, Vance’s bruised throat, Sterling’s shattered ribs, and now Hensley’s empty studio. He stared at the thread’s evidence bag, its silver glint mocking him.  
  
That evening, Corbin visited Hensley’s assistant, Paul Carter, at his apartment in Fells Point. The street was cobblestoned, lined with bars and boutiques, their neon signs buzzing in the rain. Carter was in his thirties, lanky, with shaggy brown hair and nervous green eyes. He stood in his doorway, a flannel shirt untucked, the warm light of his cluttered living room spilling out.  
  
“Detective,” Carter said, his voice unsteady. “Margaret’s okay, right? I saw the news.”  
  
“She’s fine,” Corbin said, his notepad damp. “I need to know about her. Anything unusual? Enemies, odd clients?”  
  
Carter ran a hand through his hair. “She’s tough but fair. Runs the gallery like a general. No enemies I know of. There was… one thing. A collector, maybe a year ago, got angry over a deal—said she cheated him. Threatened to sue, but it fizzled out.”  
  
Corbin scribbled angry collector, his pen scratching loudly. “Anything else? Strange visitors, calls?”  
  
“Nothing,” Carter said, shaking his head. “She’s private. Keeps her work and life separate.”  
  
Corbin thanked him and stepped back into the rain, his cigarette glowing faintly. A hushed lawsuit, a vague threat—it was thin, but it was something. The killer was choosing these people, and Corbin needed to know why.  
  
That night, in his sparse apartment, Corbin sat at his kitchen table, the case files a chaotic sprawl under a flickering bulb. The room was bleak—peeling paint, a sagging couch, a fridge that groaned like a wounded animal. Laura’s photo sat on the coffee table, her smile a fading echo. He pushed it aside and opened Hensley’s file, his eyes scanning the details: locked studio, no break-in, silver thread. The TV blared, a news anchor’s voice cutting through: “The ‘Locked Room Murders’ terrorize Baltimore, with a fourth target narrowly escaping…”  
  
Corbin lit another cigarette, the smoke curling like a specter. Sleep offered no refuge, his dreams haunted by the victims’ vacant eyes and the killer’s invisible hand. The thread was a clue, but it wasn’t enough. The killer was out there, moving through the rain, untouchable, and Corbin felt the world slipping further from his grasp, the line between reality and nightmare blurring with every unanswered question.",1,1752802976.0,HorrorTalesCommunity,0,1.0,False

I know all the dentists out there have different protocols and ways they want you to do things. So I am just curious as to what your instructions were and what process you had.

I had the implants put in and my dentures snapped on right away. They used healing abutments to keep them in place. I can't remove them for 5 days. After that, I need to remove them and clean them. I can do it a few times a day.

My instructions for food is to not eat anything that makes noise when chewing. Things like toast, chips, candy, cereal. I can eat mashed potatoes, yogurt, protein shakes, or pudding. Anything soft really. I can't eat anything that contains high sodium like tomato soup, or canned items if they have a large amount of sodium.  
For the next 10 days, I can't drink anything other than water. No soda, coffee, caffeine, alcohol, or even juice. Only water. Not even flavored water.

In 14 days I go back and they trade out the healing abutments for the permanent ones. I believe at that time, I can probably have more options for food and drink.

One of the other things suggested was Bone-Tite Osseointegration Support Supplement (attached image). I was reading about it from the Amazon listing. So has anyone taken it or did your denture doctor recommend it?  
The food and drink restrictions? Can someone explain anything about why sodium is an issue with new implants. Or so many days without anything to drink besides water?

Jim Linsey got into a fight. 

When Daisy Underwood received the call from the police station, it was already eleven o'clock at night. 

Her college dormitory had strict access control, and when Daisy tried to leave, the dorm supervisor made things difficult for her. In the end, the supervisor sighed as if lamenting the state of the world, saying, ""You college students nowadays... You're a young lady, yet you don't know how to conduct yourself..."" 

Daisy knew the supervisor had misunderstood, but she didn't have time to explain. She hurried out. After braving the heavy snow to flag down a taxi at the side entrance of the school, she headed to the police station. 

Bailing Jim out required some paperwork, mainly filling out forms and paying a fee. 

The officer asked Daisy, ""What is your relationship with Jim Linsey?"" 

Daisy hesitated for a moment before answering, ""I've been his very good friend since childhood."" 

The Linsey and Underwood families had a long-standing friendship. When Daisy's grandfather, Alan Underwood, was alive, he and Jim's grandfather, Joseph Linsey, had arranged a betrothal between their grandchildren. Neither Jim's parents nor hers objected. Jim's parents tacitly agreed that Daisy would eventually become their daughter-in-law. 

Among everyone, only Jim had an ambiguous attitude. Did he ever strongly oppose this arrangement? Not really. Whenever he was teased about this, he would just laugh it off. But did he agree with this arrangement? Not really either. Because he had never privately told Daisy that he wanted to be with her. 

He treated Daisy well, but it seemed he always maintained a certain distance. 

This attitude sometimes left Daisy feeling a bit anxious. However, as a girl, she was shy. Even though she really liked Jim and had accepted the arrangement between their families in her heart, she found it hard to say anything outright. To this day, she could only refer to herself as his very good friend since childhood. 

""He only has one emergency contact in his phone, and that's you. I thought you were family,"" the officer said, somewhat surprised, ""he smashed up a bar for his girlfriend."" 

Daisy paused. Doubting her hearing, she asked, ""What... His girlfriend?"" 

""Yeah, a girl named Ingrid Chase. When they were at the bar, some thugs were bothering Miss Chase, and Mr. Linsey just smashed a bottle over one of their heads..."" The officer clicked his tongue. ""He's pretty ruthless. That guy is still in the hospital for surgery, and the bar is also involved. You guys need to figure out how to handle this. It might even lead to a lawsuit."" 

Daisy was completely stunned. She and Jim communicated almost every day, whether through messages or calls, and he had never mentioned that he had a girlfriend. 

After completing the paperwork, Jim was led out by the officer. 

As soon as Daisy looked up, she noticed a new scar on his forehead. 

It was two inches long, slanting across his left temple, just scabbed over, and it stood out prominently on his handsome face. 

This wasn't Jim's first fight. 

Jim's history of fighting could be dated back to their middle school days. This young heir was raised with indulgence. With the Linsey family's wealth and influence, compromise and retreat were never in his vocabulary. He had lived recklessly and arrogantly all these years. 

He approached Daisy and called out, ""Daisy Bud."" 

Those close to Daisy called her by her given name, but only Jim insisted on being different, adding ""bud"" to her name. Though it was just a nickname, it carried a hint of intimacy. 

At that moment, Daisy was still trying to process everything. She stared at the cut on his forehead, instinctively wanting to ask if it hurt. But as she was about to speak out, she instead asked, ""Who is Ingrid?"" 

Jim paused for a moment, gently tugging at her sleeve to lead her out of the police station lobby. ""Let's talk outside."" 

The forecast predicted a snowstorm tonight, but the severity of the weather exceeded expectations. 

Daisy, with her slender frame, felt as if she might be blown away. She regretted hastily grabbing a wool coat on her way out, clearly inadequate against the wind and snow. 

Jim guided her across the street to the hotel on the other side. 

Daisy's thoughts were a jumble as she wrapped her coat tighter around herself. But her frozen mind was still trying to figure out who Ingrid was. 

Once they entered the hotel lobby, warmed by the air conditioning, she felt as if she had come back to life, slowly clenching her stiff fingers. 

Jim didn't stop at the front desk but took her straight to the elevator, casually explaining, ""Ingrid is my girlfriend. I was planning to introduce her to you soon, but today this happened... She's in a room upstairs."" 

Daisy remained in a daze, feeling numb from the cold. It was only when they stepped out of the elevator that she remembered to ask, ""Since she's your girlfriend, why didn't she come to bail you out?"" 

""She was harassed by some thugs and was really shaken up,"" Jim explained as they walked, ""besides, the storm outside is so bad..."" 

Only after saying that did he realize it was inappropriate. He then said, ""Thanks for your help tonight, Daisy Bud. Once this is all sorted out, I'll take you out for dinner."" 

Daisy felt as if the storm had blown straight into her heart. She felt unbearably cold. 

Jim knocked on the door, and soon someone came to answer. As the door swung open, the person rushed straight into Jim's arms. 

Ingrid spoke with a quivering voice, ""You scared me to death... Why were you so impulsive, getting into a fight with those people... Are you hurt? Does it hurt?"" 

""I'm fine."" Jim pressed Ingrid's hand down as she reached for his forehead, clearing his throat to indicate that there was another person present.  ""This is Daisy Bud,"" he introduced. 

Only then did Ingrid realize there was someone else beside her and turn to look at Daisy. 

Daisy had a somewhat cool appearance. She didn't wear any make-up, yet she didn't look plain. However, in comparison, the made-up Ingrid looked much more refined. 

""So you're Daisy Bud. Jimmy talks about you all the time. Nice to meet you,"" Ingrid said, extending her hand. Daisy hesitated for a moment before reciprocating the handshake out of politeness. 

As they entered the room and closed the door, Jim had just sat down on the sofa when Ingrid leaned in again, using a tissue to wipe his wounds. 

Daisy felt uncomfortable, standing still. 

Jim pushed Ingrid's hands away and said, ""Don't bother. I'll wash up later. First, let's find a place for Daisy Bud to stay. Her college dormitory is probably locked."" 

Jim picked up the hotel phone to call the front desk, but after just a couple of sentences, he hung up. 

Due to the extreme weather, the hotel was fully booked. 

Ingrid pouted and said, ""There's no way we can get a room now. I booked this king-size bedroom for us this morning."" 

Daisy's first thought was that these two had booked a room together in the morning, and it was a king-size bedroom. 

She couldn't understand how her thoughts had strayed so far. But the more she tried to suppress her thoughts, the more uncontrollable they became. She thought to herself, ""Had they really progressed to this point? How long had they been dating?"" 

Jim had hidden it so well. 

About a month ago, when she saw him at the Linsey family gathering, Joseph had jokingly asked him when he planned to bring her home as his bride. Daisy had blushed, and she clearly remembered how he responded. 

He told Joseph, ""Grandpa, you're too eager. We should at least wait until Daisy Bud graduates."" 

Her misunderstanding deepened with his vague attitude.  She often felt that she must be special to him as he was to her. 

But now, she felt like he had played a huge joke on her. 

She couldn't bring herself to smile, pulling out her phone to look down, and said, ""It's fine. I'll look for other hotels nearby."" 

Ingrid suggested, ""We will help you look on our phone. And you should hurry downstairs and see if there are any other hotels around available. If we manage to book one, we'll call you. It'll be more efficient if we both act at the same time."" 

Daisy wasn't stupid. It was clear that Ingrid was trying to drive her away. 

She didn't want to linger either, so she turned and walked out. 

""Wait, I'll walk you..."" Before Jim could finish his sentence, Ingrid quickly grabbed his arm. 

""You're injured. Why are you running around? You should rest..."" 

Daisy didn't catch the rest of their words as she stepped outside and closed the door behind her. 

As she exited the hotel, a chill hit her face. The world seemed to be enveloped in a swirling white veil. 

Daisy tightened her coat around her, feeling snowflakes land on her long eyelashes, only to fall away with her blink, like a tear. 

Chapter 2 Jim Gave Her Nothing but Snow Tonight

Jim had a playful nature, and Daisy was well aware of that.

As a child, he enjoyed games like skateboarding, and during college, he was into bands, skiing, and more. John, his father, had hoped he would study abroad and return to take over the family business, but after graduating, Jim refused to continue his education and instead took up racing.

He played with everything except women.

It was precisely because he didn't engage with any women that Daisy had allowed herself to harbor feelings towards him for so long.

She thought that since he didn't have a girlfriend and never clarified anything to his parents, he must be like her, silently accepting the childhood betrothal between their families.

Now, she couldn't believe how foolish she had been.

There weren't many hotels nearby. Daisy had checked on her phone map. After walking two blocks through the wind and snow, she finally entered another hotel.

She approached the front desk, shivering as she took out her phone to ask if there were any rooms available.

The receptionist politely replied, ""I'm sorry, ma'am, but we are fully booked for the night.""

Daisy felt as if the world was closing in on her.

In this weather, she truly didn't have the courage to go out searching for another hotel. She stood stiffly at the front desk, contemplating whether to just sit on the sofa in the hotel lobby for the night when suddenly, she heard a voice call out, ""Miss Undwerwood.""

Startled, she turned to look.

A man in a black trench coat approached. He was tall, with long legs, handsome features, and an air of sophistication. Daisy stared into his eyes for several seconds before instinctively responding with a name, asking, ""Lenore?""

As soon as the words left her mouth, she regretted her impulsiveness.

Lenore Linsey was Jim's half-brother, three years older than her. Out of politeness and their unfamiliarity, she should have addressed him as Mr. Linsey.

However, Lenore had a unique status as John's illegitimate son, and even Jim had never referred to him as a brother.

Daisy hadn't interacted much with him, and even now, she wasn't sure how to address him.

Lenore didn't seem to mind the way she addressed him. He frowned and asked what she was doing at the hotel so late.

His voice was low, and Daisy felt a string in her heart being plucked.

Perhaps it was because she was feeling so vulnerable at that moment. Even this small gesture of concern made her nose tingle with emotion.

""Jim got into a fight, and I just went to the police station to bail him out,"" she replied honestly.

Lenore wasn't surprised and asked, ""Where's he? Why are you alone?""

""He booked a room at the hotel near the police station with his girlfriend,"" Daisy replied. Her tone was heavy with disappointment. ""When I left, the dorm was locked, and I couldn't go back. There were no other rooms available at that hotel, and I didn't want to stay with them, so I came here to ask around.""

Upon hearing this, Lenore paused for a moment. ""Aren't you... Aren't you his girlfriend?""

He had heard about that so-called childhood engagement. As far as he remembered, both families had long agreed that Jim and Daisy were a couple, and neither of the two had ever denied it.

Daisy struggled to make her expression seem more natural. She forced a smile, saying, ""No, not at all...""

Her tone was stiff, and she added, ""It never was.""

Lenore stared at her thoughtfully, remaining silent.

When Daisy met his gaze, her mind began to swirl.

Lenore's eyes were strikingly unique; while most people had brown irises, they were deep, pure black, just like his hair.

Such eyes were beautiful but could also create a misleading impression. When his gaze was fixed on her, his eyes seemed like gentle whirlpools.

She quickly averted her gaze, feeling flustered, and continued to explain, ""That childhood engagement thing... It was just a joke from the elders. What era are we...""

Lenore interrupted her, ""If that's the case, you should have clarified things with your families earlier. Besides, Jim always turns to you when he has a problem. Now that he's in a fight and needs you to bail him out, is his girlfriend just a ghost?""

Daisy was taken aback.

She hadn't expected Lenore to be so blunt.

However... She found his point quite reasonable.

Lenore shifted the topic, asking, ""Have you checked into a room yet?""

Daisy shook her head in frustration. ""There are no available rooms here either.""

Lenore paused for two seconds and said, ""I'm staying in a penthouse suite in this hotel. If you don't mind, you can sleep in the guest room.""

Daisy had no room to be picky at that moment and quickly expressed her gratitude.

Lenore moved out of the Linsey Residence before graduating from high school. That place never truly felt like his own home.

This was considered a scandal for the Linsey family, as John's illegitimate son Lenore was actually a year older than the real heir, Jim, the cherished son.

John had once fathered a child with a woman in secret, only to abandon her later, and eventually entered into a family-arranged marriage with Emily, Jim's mother.

The Underwood family lived next door to the Linsey family, and Daisy, at just five years old, would listen to her parents gossip about the Linseys.

Lenore hadn't originally lived with the Linsey family; it was his mother who had forced him into that household.

It was easy to imagine how awkward his situation was within the Linsey family.

Emily wouldn't even allow him to sit at the dinner table.

At that time, Daisy spent her days playing with Jim, who would tell her that Lenore was the child of a mistress, tainted with dirty blood, and a bad kid. Being so young, she took Jim's words to heart.

Pulling herself from her memories, Daisy found herself following Lenore into the room.

The signs of life in the suite were evident, and Daisy had no idea how long Lenore had been living there alone.

Lenore changed his shoes and, recalling something, said, ""There are no slippers for ladies here. I'll have the hotel send some up.""

Daisy felt embarrassed to trouble him and quickly waved her hand, ""It's fine, just for one night; I can manage.""

Lenore took off his coat, washed his hands, and then stepped into the kitchen. When he returned, he was holding a cup of warm water, which he placed on the coffee table for Daisy. ""Drinking some will warm you up.""

Daisy was still feeling cold and hadn't taken off her coat yet. She sat on the sofa, picked up the cup, and said thank you.

She actually wanted to ask Lenore why he had returned to the place so late, but it was clear he wasn't in the mood for conversation. He walked toward the master bedroom, saying indifferently, ""I won't be using the bathroom outside. There are disposable toiletries inside. Help yourself, and get some rest.""

Daisy opened her mouth to speak, but by then, the man had already entered the master bedroom, closing the door behind him.

She sighed inwardly. Lenore seemed just as he had before - Reserved, especially when it came to talking to her.

It wasn't entirely his fault. Given the things she and Jim had done in their childhood, it was a wonder he didn't dislike her.

Still, the warmth of the hot water made her feel somewhat revived. At least Lenore had provided her with a place to stay and a cup of warm water, while Jim had only given her the biting wind and snow tonight.

She slowly finished her water and stood up to wash up when there was a knock at the door.

Walking over to open it, she found a hotel staff member waiting outside.

""These are the things Mr. Linsey requested."" The waiter handed over the bag, and Daisy assumed it contained slippers. She thanked him as she took it.

After closing the door and opening the bag, she was taken aback.

The bag was large, and inside were not only the slippers but also brand new women's skincare products, and even a cup of hot drink-ginger tea with brown sugar.

That night, Daisy tossed and turned in the bed of the suite's guest room, unable to sleep.

Jim had thrown her a curve ball, forcing her to reevaluate their relationship.

In the early hours of the morning, just as sleep began to take hold, her phone vibrated suddenly. She picked it up to take a look.

Jim had sent a message: Daisy Bud, have you made it to the room?

Oh, so he still remembered that she existed.

She flipped her phone face down on the nightstand, closed her eyes, and in her drowsy state, a thought crossed her mind, ""Jim actually sucks... He's not even as good as Lenore.""

Chapter 3 She Couldn't Understand the Emotions in His Eyes

Daisy was a well-behaved girl, and throughout her life, she considered the most outrageous thing she had ever done was being an accomplice to Jim when they were kids.

When Lenore first arrived at the Linsey family, she not only faced cold treatment from Aunt Emily but also endured ostracism from all his classmates at school, all thanks to Jim's social connections.

Jim had always been popular among his peers; as a child, with just a word from him, his gang of followers would rush forward to torment Lenore.

One time, Daisy happened to witness it.

A group of kids tore apart Lenore's textbooks and homework, and Jim was among them.

The scene was suffocating. Lenore had actually wanted to run away, but someone spotted her and shoved a piece of Lenore's test paper into her hands, urging her to tear it too.

Little Daisy was rigid then.

""Tear it!"" a boy shouted, ""This is what the child of a mistress deserves, ruining other people's families and still having the nerve to come to school.""

""Exactly! He deserves this!""

To the children, there was no sense of sequence. They only knew that Lenore was a bastard, and her mother was the other woman.

Daisy's heart raced as the crowd jeered, everyone tearing at the pages, someone whistling. She closed her eyes, steeling herself, and ripped the test paper in her hands.

Just like that, Daisy safely integrated into the group. When she looked up, she accidentally locked eyes with Lenore.

Lenore was ten that year, but his gaze was already deep and dark, filled with emotions Daisy couldn't comprehend.

Feeling anxious and guilty, she quickly turned her face away.

In the morning, Daisy woke from her dreams, staring at the small chandelier on the ceiling, feeling a moment of confusion.

She couldn't understand why she had dreamt of something from so long ago.

As her body awakened, everything from last night flooded back into her mind, and she remembered.

Jim had a girlfriend now. He had fought for her, and they had even slept in one room.

She sat up, exhaling deeply, rubbed her face, and got out of bed to wash up.

When she stepped outside, she found Lenore was already up, sitting at the dining table. Hearing the noise, he looked over.

""Um... Good morning,"" Daisy said awkwardly, raising her hand in a half-hearted wave, still unsure of how to address him.

Lenore's face was expressionless as he simply said, ""Finish washing up and come eat breakfast.""

Surprisingly, there was breakfast to be had.

Daisy was a bit taken aback. As she entered the bathroom to freshen up, the dream from last night resurfaced in her mind, and she covered her face with her hands.

Although she later felt guilty and tried to make amends, the kind of hurt she caused was likely hard to forget.

If she, the perpetrator, couldn't forget, how could Lenore?

She began to wonder why he had taken her in last night.

Stepping out of the bathroom, Daisy obediently made her way to the dining room and sat across from Lenore.

It was a simple, ordinary breakfast, consisting of coffee, a bagel, and a few light sides.

As Daisy took a bite of the bagel, her eyes lit up. ""Is this from Marline Bakery?""

Lenore didn't look up, merely responding with a soft ""mm-hmm.""

Marline Bakery was quite famous in Jellyland City. Daisy had loved it before, but after the shop was discovered by a food blogger, it became a trendy spot, leading to the current situation where it was hard to get a bagel. Mornings required waiting in line for quite a while, and Daisy found it too much trouble, so she hadn't had one in ages.

Daisy enjoyed her breakfast thoroughly. As she wiped her mouth, she thought to say to Lenore, ""Thank you so much! Let me treat you to a meal sometime.""

Lenore paused in his motion of drying his hands. ""Sure.""

Daisy had expected him to decline. It wasn't that she was unwilling to buy him a meal; she just thought Lenore probably wouldn't want to have any further contact with her. She was surprised by how readily he agreed.

However, she felt it was only right to express her gratitude. She took out her phone. ""Let's exchange contact information, so we can set up a time.""

Lenore handed over his phone, and she scanned adding him as a friend.

His profile picture was a dark night sky with a single star hanging in the blackness.

""It suits his brooding personality,"" Daisy thought.

Suddenly, her phone vibrated in her hand. They both glanced over, and Daisy saw that Jim was calling.

Daisy furrowed her brow and stood up to answer the call.

As soon as she picked up, Jim's tense voice came through, ""Daisy Bud, where are you?""

Daisy hesitated.

She was with Lenore, and if Jim found out, he would probably go crazy.

Although Jim had matured with age and no longer referred to Lenore as the child of a mistress, he had always viewed Lenore as an intruder in his home.

He naturally assumed that Daisy was on his side.

Daisy replied, ""I... I'm at the hotel.""

""Why didn't you reply to my messages last night? You scared me to death..."" Jim sounded relieved, ""I thought you hadn't made it back to your room. I came to school looking for you around six this morning.""

At that moment, Daisy felt unusually calm, thinking that if she had really spent the night outside, his search at six in the morning would only be to help collect her body.

She remained silent, and Jim continued, ""As long as you're okay, by the way, you mustn't tell anyone about me going to the police station, especially my family. If my parents or grandpa find out, they'll skin me alive.""

Daisy realized she had already told Lenore.

She was in the living room now, glancing back at Lenore, hoping she wouldn't spill the beans to the Linsey family...

As luck would have it, Lenore stood up from the dining table and was looking in her direction.

Their eyes met, and Daisy felt a bit awkward, quickly averting her gaze as she told Jim, ""Got it.""

""I have to go to the police station today to handle the follow-up,"" Jim said, ""Once I'm done, I'll definitely treat you to a big meal as thanks.""

Daisy absentmindedly agreed.

After hanging up, she tried to sort through her thoughts.

She was in her senior year, just six months away from graduation. Originally, she thought that even if they didn't get married or engaged, Jim would at least show some sign of commitment, that they would establish their relationship.

Now Jim had indeed shown something... He said he was dating someone.

She felt incredibly hurt, a heavy weight in her chest, unable to think clearly. This was the man she had liked since she first fell in love; she had always believed it would be mutual, but it turned out to be a one-sided affection that ended without resolution.

No matter how Jim handled this, she would have to explain everything to her parents.

There was a knock at the door, and Lenore walked straight to open it.

A moment later, she returned with a large paper tote bag in hand, handing it to Daisy, ""It's cold outside; put this on before you go out.""

Daisy took the package and opened it to find a brand new women's down jacket, and it was from her usual brand.

She felt a bit embarrassed to accept it, but she was indeed very cold, so she asked, ""How much is it? I can transfer the money to you.""

Lenore was silent for a few seconds before replying, ""No need, consider it an early birthday gift from me to you.""

Daisy was surprised that Lenore even remembered her birthday, which was just next week.

This gift felt quite strange. She had never received a gift from him before, and she had never invited him to her birthday celebrations since Jim was always around during that time.

Naturally, she hadn't planned to invite him this time either, which made things awkward...

She racked her brain and finally came up with a solution, saying, ""So, what do you want for your birthday? I can get you something.""

""No need,"" Lenore replied casually, ""My birthday has already passed, and... I never celebrate my birthday.""",2,1752802725.0,novelsfree,3,1.0,False

However when I fill my moka to the brim both with coffee and water the way you're supposed to, I get about 120- 150 mls worth of coffee which is like almost 3 shots. 

I also want my shot to have use about 10gms of coffee powder each aa ita what I've found works for me.

Thanks for the help.

I always went for regular checkups and had good gums 1,2,3s). In my 50s, had a root canal/crown, a separate crown, and a lost tooth.  I moved and the dentist said it would be okay to miss a checkup. So after 11 months, I went to the new dentist and was shocked that I had some 4s and 5s on 3 teeth. I still had a bunch of ones, but the inflammation they saw was concerning. On one tooth, I had a small amount of bone loss (but that had been there before). They recommended the antibiotic injection in 3 spots followed by root planing. I spoke a lot to the hygienist and followed her tips. At the 6 week check up, things calmed down but in 1 spot, the 5 was a 4. She told me I could go for 4 months in between appointments.

Today, I went back and everything that was a 4 or 5 was a 2 or 3 ,my gums were firm and had something she called stippling. No root planing needed. Also no bleeding when probing. She said it is very rare she sees this, but that if I wanted, I could switch to 6 months check ups. And that my periodontal disease was now stable! 

For those newly diagnosed, improvement is possible. Here’s what I did:

- switched to electric toothbrush. Watched video on how to use well. 
- switched to coco floss. Use once a day.
- switched to brushing first thing in the morning before coffee vs after. Wait at least 20 minutes before drinking
- got xylitol mints. Use after coffee, last meal and sometimes mid day 
- for water flosser. Use 2x/day and always after last meal.
- floss at night after water flosser (was doing this but hygienist showed me better technique)
- take probiotic and drink kefir a few times a week. Unsweetened and with something that is shown to be good for mouth bacteria.
- I use uncle Harry’s, about 5 drops diluted in water. I use it throughout the week (keep in glass jar). I did this before but have continued.
