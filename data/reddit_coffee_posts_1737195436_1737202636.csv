I had helicobacter pylori 13 months ago but I cured it with quad therapy. (Breath test and gastroscopy urea test confirmed it gone)

Since curing it my gastritis didn't stop, my stomach still hurts. Difficulty passing stool, often runny stool. Sometimes an acid reflux (though rarely because I don't overeat.)

A gastroscopy last October (same one that confirmed negative urea test for hpylori) displayed build ups of yellow bile, and an irritated stomach lining.

From googling and asking around my guess is that the pyloric valve isn't closing and ends up releasing too much bile. The question is how do I get it to function properly again? I couldn't find a medication or other type of treatment for this specific problem (or symptoms for that matter.)

Is it possible that this behavior is caused by low stomach acid? That after finishing quad therapy, my acid still hadn't gotten back to normal levels and too much bile is being released? I don't understand a lot of it so even if you don't know how to cure me, I would appreciate info on how it all works.",1,1737202474.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

But I also tried to go to my grandma's last weekend to stay the night and get away from her and I've been taking care of nana during the weekdays and I end up having to during the weekend too because no one else really does their to busy doing other crap and before she was bed ridden I had to watch and make sure she didn't go outside because she's fallen out there on the steps and such before and we live in kinda a woodsy area and we didn't want her going in the woods or anything so one night they let her go outside and she got all the way up the drive way and keep in the mind that drive way is really long so it took her a good at least 20 to probably 30 minutes to just get up there and let alone get down the steps and to the actual mail box so there's no way she just disappeared for a quick second which is what she claimed then another time her and her husband were doing something in their room idk what but either way they weren't paying attention to the monitor and she got out of the house with her walker so that took even longer and no one came out to check on her nothing so back to what I was saying so I had asked and she had the absolute nerve to tell me that I'm not gonna he able to go over to her house every weekend and she makes it so I have a break like no you don't because I'm still doing the absolute most around here and I always will be because I'm apparently the parent and I have to keep the house clean take care of nana and do school stuff all while keeping my dog content and finding time to take care of myself. But let me go ahead and tell you how she talked about my dad before he passed and how she still talks about him after he passed before after she'd pick me up from seeing him she'd make up random stories about him and tell me on the way home like bad stories where she's the victim she does the same about me and everyone else and when I'd tell him about them he'd tell me what actually happened and I'd ask my grandma too on both sides before my grandma on my dad's side died but then after he died like right after I got home from my step mom's house because he was supposed to come home on hospice the day after so I was just gonna stay the night so I could be there when he got home but he went to the home in the sky so I had just called my mom and asked her to come get me and take me home which she did and when we got home and I was in my room with my stuffed animal he gave me with I was 5 and had patched up countless times because if how I held it we had to preform emergency restuffings she had the nerve to ask me if I had ever had sex at the ripe age of 10 as I was in my bed trying not to cry and she at one point took my door off because of the way it shut you kinda had to slam it for it to latch and she didn't belive that even though she knew that was how it shut she still took my door off for 6 months then lied that she didn't know where the pins and stuff was to put it back on so I showed her where she laid them at and she was mad at me for that so she grounded me from my door for 2 more weeks then when I had just started school I've always been scared of like groups of people right and so I was always scared to go to school and because I was getting bullied since the first day basically i never wanted to go back but anyways she had told her mother in law to use a switch on me for it so I called her Re so Re had told me that she had bought me a pair of pants and she wanted me to try them on and had used the switch on me for a good 15 minutes and my mother had come and picked me up while I stood in the middle of the living room sobbing with my pants in my hand because yes I had been spanked and all before and smacked and all but never switched so it was quite the surprise then the other time that I vividly remember is when I told my mom I'll make her breakfast the following morning so I bad got up a bit earlier and had started her coffee once she had told me she was up and I made her something that I knew was her favorite which was oatmeal so I made it and brought it to the table and made it look nice and at that moment her husband walked in with her some takeout breakfast and she ate his breakfast and flipped her shit because I was upset that she didn't eat the oatmeal I had made her so she followed me to my room and started slapping me and I had put my hands up over my face to like keep my face from getting it which really annoyed her so she had punched me a few times all while her husband watched but that's all I'm gonna write mainly because I feel the urge to cry from going back and thinking of this stuff. I'm extremely sorry that this has been a run on sentence I was trying get the memories out as quick as I remembered it all. I'm also sorry to waste everyone's time.

Our sage Oracle is nearly 2 yrs old. Have used same beans since the start, fresh bag every 2 weeks approx. Since Xmas the tamper doesn't tamp, it's like the grinder keeps going then times out. If I click grind again it might tamp immediately or grind for a few seconds and then tamp. However it's obvious then that too much coffee is in the portafilter as nothing comes out in the brew. 
Right now I have it at grind size 20. 25g of coffee comes out of grinder yielding 41g of coffee when I brew for 29 secs. I just measured using kitchen scale for this post.
If I grind finer it will def time out. If I grind courser the water/coffee flies out! 
I have cleaned everything, for the bristles and Hoover into the grinder etc. What changes to the settings should you suggest we make? Thank you in advance!

One such standout piece that is gaining popularity is the concrete coffee table. With its sleek, industrial charm, a [concrete coffee table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/monet-concrete-cloud-coffee-table-white) can easily elevate the aesthetic of any living space, adding sophistication and character in an instant. Whether you're designing a modern, minimalist, or industrial-inspired interior, a concrete coffee table or even a concrete side table can be the perfect addition to complete your look.

# 1. The Bold and Modern Appeal of Concrete

Concrete is often associated with industrial design, and rightly so—it carries a sense of strength and durability that instantly adds a modern edge to your living room. A concrete coffee table stands as a striking centerpiece, commanding attention without overwhelming the space. Its clean lines and solid form create an architectural focal point that complements a variety of other materials, such as wood, metal, or glass.

The raw, unfinished aesthetic of concrete adds texture and depth to a room, making it the perfect contrast to softer furnishings like plush sofas and soft textiles. Whether it's a simple, minimalist design or a table with intricate, sculptural features, a concrete coffee table can be the anchor for a bold living room aesthetic.

# 2. Versatility in Design

One of the biggest advantages of a concrete coffee table is its versatility. Concrete can be molded into almost any shape, allowing for endless design possibilities. From geometric, angular tables to smooth, rounded surfaces, a concrete coffee table can be customized to fit any style or preference.

In addition, a concrete coffee table pairs effortlessly with various decor styles. If you have a modern or contemporary living room, a sleek, polished concrete coffee table will complement the clean, simple lines of your furniture. For an industrial-inspired space, choose a raw, unfinished concrete table to add a rustic touch. Even in more eclectic or bohemian settings, a concrete coffee table can introduce an unexpected yet sophisticated element that grounds the room.

To further elevate the design, consider pairing your concrete coffee table with a matching concrete side table. [Side tables](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/tables/outdoor-side-tables) made of concrete create a seamless transition between your main furniture pieces and help unify the overall aesthetic of the room.

# 3. Textural Contrast and Balance

A concrete coffee table introduces texture in a way that soft fabrics, wood, or metal cannot. Its raw, rough surface or polished, smooth finish provides a striking contrast against the other materials in your living room, creating visual interest and balance. For example, if your sofa is upholstered in soft velvet or linen, a concrete coffee table’s cool, solid surface will provide the perfect counterpoint, enhancing the visual appeal of both elements.

This textural contrast is especially effective in modern or industrial design schemes, where the combination of soft and hard materials is often key to achieving the right balance. The tactile quality of a concrete coffee table also encourages interaction—whether you’re placing a drink down or simply admiring its design, the texture adds a sensory layer to the experience.

# 4. Durability and Functionality

In addition to its aesthetic appeal, a concrete coffee table is incredibly durable and functional. Concrete is one of the most robust materials available, making it an ideal choice for furniture that will stand the test of time. Unlike wood or glass, concrete resists scratches, dents, and the wear and tear that can come with everyday use. This means your concrete coffee table will maintain its beauty and functionality for years to come, making it a wise investment for any living room.

A concrete coffee table is also easy to maintain. While it may require some periodic cleaning to avoid staining, its surface is resistant to spills and scratches, making it perfect for homes with busy households or high traffic areas. If you opt for a concrete side table, you’ll enjoy the same level of durability and ease of care for smaller surfaces that can double as both functional pieces and striking decor elements.

# 5. Pairing Concrete with Other Materials

One of the unique features of a concrete coffee table is its ability to complement a wide variety of other materials. Concrete, while sturdy and heavy, is surprisingly versatile when it comes to mixing with different textures and finishes. For a luxurious contrast, consider pairing your concrete coffee table with a glass top, allowing the raw texture of the concrete to be visible while maintaining a sleek, elegant design.

Wooden accents, whether in the form of legs, handles, or decorative objects, can also pair beautifully with concrete. The warmth of wood creates a perfect balance with the coolness of concrete, ensuring that the living room feels inviting and grounded. If you prefer a more industrial look, pairing a concrete coffee table with metal elements, like steel or iron, enhances its rugged appeal while maintaining a sophisticated edge.

# 6. Concrete Coffee Tables for Small and Large Spaces

Concrete coffee tables work well in both small and large living rooms. For smaller spaces, a minimalist concrete table can create a clean, unobstructed view, making the room feel more spacious. Its solid form without any excessive detailing means that it won’t overwhelm a smaller area but will still serve as a statement piece.

In larger rooms, a concrete coffee table can help anchor the space, drawing the eye to the center of the room and tying together the other design elements. A larger, more sculptural concrete table can serve as the focal point of a room, ensuring that your furniture arrangement is both functional and visually striking.

# Conclusion

A concrete coffee table is a powerful statement piece that can elevate your living room's aesthetic with its bold, modern appeal and versatile design. Whether you’re looking to add texture, contrast, or durability to your space, concrete offers a timeless material that complements a variety of interior styles. Paired with concrete side tables or other materials like wood and metal, a concrete coffee table can create a sophisticated, balanced look that makes your living room a space you’ll love to spend time in",1,1737202303.0,u_homeandsoul,0,1.0,False

It's misdirected motivation.

I'm always motivated to doomscroll X/Twitter. Or Substack. Or watch brownie recipes on YT (I must have watched 50 videos about the chewiest, fudgiest brownies you ever ate). Or make coffee.

I’m 22 years old. It feels like I’ve been this way for years. I started taking coffee when I was in highschool, maybe once a week, as a treat and not as a necessity. Caffeine has always had a big effect on me and one shot of espresso would give me energy for the entire day.

After finishing school and university being mostly online because of the pandemic I’ve become an extremely tired individual. Nothing would work, I’d skip classes, sleep until late, if I forced myself to wake up and do something I would drag myself back to bed an hour later because I was so tired. I have times when it gets slightly better, usually in the warmer months, but in general I sleep 9 hours every night and if I don’t drink coffee I feel groggy the entire day.

Recently, because I’m quite busy and feel like I’m falling behind on everything (basically I waste entire mornings I could spend studying, working out, dedicating myself to hobbies I have not touched in years), I ask my family to bring me coffee to bed (which I understand sounds so entitled, but it’s the only thing that will get me up before 8am) and I’ve considered getting one of those timed coffee machines that you set up the night before and makes coffee automatically, so that I can keep this habit up without bothering the rest of my family. 

It looks like a decent solution, but I feel so dependent on caffeine. Once the effect runs off I get headaches, really bad anxiety and feel even worse, and if I drink another cup I can’t sleep at night, which makes me wake up even later and goes against the whole point: I want to wake up early.

I’ve tried energizing teas, mate, eating big and nutritions breakfasts, but nothing improves my mood and energy in the morning quite like coffee. I want to quit at some point, but getting into this habit of coffee being the very first thing in the morning feels like taking a huge stepback.",1,1737202229.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

You can’t be your parents, you can’t be something you’re not. Maybe a good thing I’ve learned from Krakoa, lying to yourself is what we do.
I’m delusional.”

Still under water, yellow and orange remind us of an egg, as the shape around her body becomes clear, other eggs around.

“I need to be myself. I need to find a way out of this forest.”

- San Francisco. Today. 

Laura wakes up in the water. Her wolverine costume ruined and destroyed by god knows what. Bubbles escapes from her mouth, searching for air as her green eyes darts rapidly around searching for the surface. Her black wet hair emerge from the water, near a wharf.

Her body drag her up until she lay on the end of the pier. Coughing and spitting water out of her mouth.

We watch her from a top, seeing her rest there, catching rest, the ruined costume.

“Fuck me. These cost a lot nowdays, it was one of the last few I had stored away.”

She takes the cowl in her hand, putting it against the sun covered by clouds and seagulls flying above.
We watch for her point of view, the cowl is ruined in few parts.

“Now, let’s figure out how to get out from this fucking forest.”

Laura slowly getting up, dragging her bruised and beaten body, covered from a destroyed costume, catching from the corner of her eyes a simple black sweater of “The Cure” on a small vendor on the wharf.
Stolen.

“Sorry. No money on a tight ass ruined costume.”

Her silhouette walking in the background on the streets of San Francisco, hands inside the pockets. Just walking in the light fog.

“San Francisco, the Golden City, the Paris of the West… lots of nicknames. But for me most of the stuff I know is beneath layers and layers of fog. It’s the Fog City. My life is still foggy to me, like father like daughter.
I’m not famous, I don’t wanna be famous, Wolverine is famous. He wants it or not, he’ll always be famous, whoever wear the cowl.
But what do I really want? Am I okay with stuff?
I still don’t know if I’m fine with that in my head.”

Laura stop in front of a house, the old house of her aunt and cousin has been rebuilt, still for sale. She gets closer inspecting it closer.

“Fuck. I thought I wanted to be a better version of Logan, and look, I failed.
I don’t call.
I don’t write.
I don’t… care… maybe I should? 
Maybe I want to care?
I need to find a way to be myself.”

Laura looks between the cracks of the windows, inside is empty.
She goes for the door knob. Locked.
SNIKT!
The door opens showing her figure from below, her shadow hiding most of her image.
The door closes.

“Since I’m here, it’s better to clean up and get ready. Let’s set a perimeter around the house, let’s count entrances and escape routes.
And I need money.
And I bath. I smell like father.”

The ruined cowl now sits on the stairs with pieces of the costume scattered all over them till last piece. The pendent open next to it, Laura’s family depicted.

- Few hours later.

A donation center, Laura is wearing the sweater and a pair of dark jeans, sitting on a chair, head tilted back. Breathing slowly.

“Well, at least for now I’m good.
I never imagined to be back here.
Getting tossed around by my father’s legacy.
I wanted to take that name? I got what I wanted.”

Like small flashback, Laura is held by the neck by a bigger hand, nearly defeated, costume ruined. From the point of view of the villain, she’s held above water, from an helicopter.

- She weight a lot, let’s see if she survive in water! Ahahahahah.…

“Damn skeleton. They put adamantium inside every single one of us, I never asked for the whole package.”

Laura grabs the public phone and call.

- who’s this?
- Warren, I’m Laura. Logan’s daughter.
- Laura, a pleasure, but why from a public phone?
- Got tangled up in my father’s legacy. And lost, nearly drowned and now I’m here, trying to make something of my life.
- Well, I wouldn’t like to be in your shoes, need anything? Money? Help?
- Just enough to get going. What I really need is to get lighter, I need Polaris.

Few days later.
In her family’s home, Laura has put together a sparse semblance of home. Few chairs, a couch and few more stuff.
As the ring echoes we see that the home is sold.

When the doors open Polaris is impressed while seeing the dark silhouette of Laura.

- You look like a kid from the 90’, you sure you want to get rid of some metal?
- Funny. Get in Lorna.

Sitting on the table with Lorna we finally see Laura new outfit while she prepare some coffee.
Black high boots with straps and metal, leather jeans, a thick belt and the same sweater.

- Warren told you what I need?
- A bit, but why? Did the adamantium started to corrode your powers?
- I got heavy, against machines and big stuff is not a problem, but when the target is faster… well, you risk to drown.
- I see, only that? I mean, I could help you, at least for few days.
- No Lorna, I need to do this for myself, get in shape and fix my messy life.
- I respect that. When you wanted to do it?
- Now.

The last images we have is Laura inside a bathtub full of water, covering her naked body with her hands, while someone is counting from 5 to 1.
She screams at the number 1 as bubbles comes out of her mouth screaming but muffled by the water, eyes squirming and claws coming out with a SNIKT!

But If You Bring Baseless, Empty Arguments, Be Ready for Consequences So Deep They Will Cut Through Your Soul and Follow You Through Every Rebirth!","Hey! So, I’m from a place where reincarnation is as common as tea or coffee, and almost every house has its own rituals about it. But guess what? I’m not one of them. In fact, I can safely say that my family has about zero logical thinkers (seriously, none!). Anyway, let's get to the point.

I’m an agnostic atheist, but there's one thing that I absolutely *do* appreciate—Krishna(from character) from the Bhagavad Gita. If you've seen Oppenheimer, you know what I mean. They mention the Gita, and it’s basically a deep philosophical guide to life. Arjuna, the warrior, is freaking out because he has to fight against his own family—cousins, uncles, teachers, you name it. Krishna steps in, drops some wisdom, and helps him see the truth. In the first chapter, it’s all deep and meaningful(for my POV), but then, in the second chapter, Krishna casually drops the concept of reincarnation, like ""Oh yeah, by the way, you’ll just keep coming back."" And I’m like, *Wait, what?* Feels a bit like someone threw astrology into a philosophical debate.

Now, let me be clear: I didn’t buy that back then, and I still don’t buy it now. But, you know what? It got me curious. So if you think you’ve got the logic or the arguments to challenge me, I’m all ears. But, heads up, if you think I’m going to stand there like a punching bag without any weapons... well, surprise! I’ve got a whole arsenal of logic and arguments waiting.

So, come at me, but know this: if you're just here to debate, you're in for a wild fire. And if you come with baseless nonsense, well, prepare to get roasted—big time.",0,1737201564.0,Reincarnation,0,0.5,False

1i461qi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/1i461qi/lousy_bumble_experience/,Lousy bumble experience,"So i have been single and been on bumble for a year now. I have gone a whole year of matching with women and them not saying a word to me after i make the first move and having the match expire. I finally had one woman talk to me last month and we hit it off and planned a coffee date. She ended up standing me up when i went to the coffee shop to meet her. Once i got there and waited for her she blocked me on all her socials and phone number.

So i want to say this too with what i am looking for. Finding a woman for a hookup is not hard for me. Once i first became single i was doing the bar/club scene and would go home with these women. I remember hitting one up the next day because i had a free day and wanted to go out and do something with someone. I tried to call one to go see a movie with me and she made up an excuse as to why she could not go. She then blocked me and i never heard from her again. I knew it was time for me to start going on more dates, so that's why i joined bumble.

A week ago i met this great woman on bumble who actually talked back. I was like ""finally! 2025 is going to be my year"". We decided to meet up for dinner and drinks and had a walk around the city chatting it up. It was a great night. We were about to end the night and she kissed me goodbye. (I let the woman decide if she wants to kiss or not, i go in for the hug and if she goes in for a kiss i will kiss back) after trying to back away because the kiss is lasting a little too long. She then asks ""so are we going back to your place?"". I know where this is leading especially after that long kiss. The 20 year old me or even the me when i first became single last year would of taken her up on that in a second. The me now is not wanting that. I am ready to get into a relationship with a woman and want something serious. I declined her the best way i could without making her think i was not attracted to her or anything ""oh i am sorry i cannot, i have to be up early at work tomorrow."" She then started making a few sexual remarks back at me and i said ""no i really cannot, but i had such a nice time tonight and would love to go out again with you. She started to get pretty mad at this, i could even see her face start to turn red. This made things awkward and the way we left it off she seemed to walk away pissed.

The next day i went to send her a message and i saw i was blocked from everything, phone number, socials you name it. I am glad i dodged a bullet with that one but the question remains....will i ever get a gf again or am i stuck with one night stands?

Side note as to why i went in on app dating. I live in a shore town, i live around all seniors and families. I work with all men at my job. I am in a few outside work activities but it has all men in them. I got hooked up on a date with a friend of one of my friends but we were not a good match. This is why i did the app dating thing since i met my ex off tinder. But i am realizing and seeing bumble and tinder (2018/2019) is not like bumble tinder (2024-2025) for every one woman there is 20 men.",1,1737201431.0,Bumble,0,1.0,False

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

[Initial meetup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/oudzf/300112_hammersmith_drinks/)

**Location/Time:** [Latymers, W6 8BS](http://www.latymershammersmith.co.uk/) / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19:00-19.30. There are usually a few people left when the pub closes - usually 23:00

Our tables are reserved, we start on the circular tables close to the entrance and we might spill over onto the table(s) nearby. There is no need to book a space/get a ticket.

The first table will either be outside or at the front to the right of the door. (also, there will be Reddit on the reserved signs [And hopefully Snoo](https://i.imgur.com/KIm6pYs.jpg))

There's a (usually quiet) optional Whatsapp group for the meetup - message me via chat for an invite link. (whatsapp group is pretty much only me posting this link each week and trying to get people to actually respond.. So no benefit of being in it if you're not showing up).

1i45wwt,https://www.reddit.com/r/travelchina/comments/1i45wwt/china_35_month_trip_report_part_1_of_2/,China 3.5 month trip report (Part 1 of 2),"***If you found this report helpful, I’d really appreciate an upvote!*** It would go a long way in helping me build enough karma to post in other subreddits and share my experiences on different topics to help others. If you have any questions about these locations, feel free to ask—preferably here on this page—so others can benefit from the answers too.

I recently got back from a big solo trip through China and thought it might be helpful to share this report. I personally found a lot of valuable information from similar posts in this subreddit, so I wanted to pay it forward. For context:

* I’m 22, male, and was traveling solo.
* I only speak Dutch and English fluently, with very basic knowledge of Chinese words such as numbers and 多少钱.
* I used a French passport with a tourist visa
* For VPNs, I used **Mullvad** and **Let’sVPN**—both worked fine, I ditched astrill the first month as the interface was useless and expensive.
* For phone service, I used **Nihaomobile** for a local number and a **3s HK SIM card** for extra data. The connection was better with 3s, but both were reliable.
* **For translation, I used Baidu translate for complex sentences and learning, while for quick conversations microsoft translate:** As many in this subreddit often point out, almost no one in China speaks English fluently—not even in cities like Beijing or Shanghai. English is mostly limited to the trendiest bars, restaurants, or hotels. If you’re not comfortable using translation apps or chatting via **WeChat/Weixin**, which has a built-in translation feature, this might not be the best destination for you.

# Other Tips:

* **Gaode (高德地图)** and **Meituan (美团)** were absolute lifesavers for finding clubs, coffee, food, or gyms. These apps are far more accurate than Apple Maps or Google Maps in China.
   * If you order food through Meituan, send the delivery driver a message that says something like: *""Hi, I don’t speak Chinese, so calling won’t work. Please drop it off at this location.""* Since I started doing this, I haven’t had any issues with drivers calling me. Also please give them a tip trough cash and just say 红包 if you get the chance (you can also give in the app), these people are getting squeezed even compared to uber eats standards and you definitely can miss a few rmb if you can order food delivery.
* **Xiaohongshu (小红书)** is great for finding information about sightseeing and hikes in less-documented areas, though it’s currently overloaded with U.S. trash.
* If you’re in a remote area where cars are the only transportation, ask your hotel reception to arrange a driver for you. They’ll usually provide a quote and can easily find someone for the next day. Costs are manageable if you’re sharing with 3–4 people, but it can get pricey if you’re traveling solo and on a tight budget (like me). If you’re ever stuck somewhere, this is the easiest way to get out—capitalism at its finest, as there’s always someone willing to drive for the right price.

The second part of this report will cover: **Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Kaiping, Shenzhen, Lanzhou, Xiahe, Zhangye, Dunhuang, Turfan, Kuqa, Kashgar, Nanning, Jingxi, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Huangshan,** and **Shanghai.** Please let me know if you have any tips in adjusting the formatting, for the second part, this is the first time I’m writing something like this on Reddit.

# Yunnan (云南, 12 days)

I flew from Hanoi to Kunming to start my journey, overall this place is VERY popular with Chinese tourists but not so much with Western ones anymore.

**Kunming (昆明, 2 days)**

Kunming is the main gateway to Yunnan. While it’s often praised as a great place to live, it’s not particularly known for adventure or sightseeing. That said, I enjoyed my time here—it’s laid-back, and the people are friendly. Here’s what I did:

* **Naigu Stone Forest** (乃古石林): This smaller stone forest is much quieter than the main Stone Forest, though it’s harder to get to. I took a DiDi from Kunming and back, which worked fine.
* **Yuantong Temple** (圆通寺): A large temple that’s worth a visit if you haven’t been to many others in China. Otherwise, it’s nothing extraordinary.
* **Wenhua Xiang** (文化巷): A trendy street where hip locals hang out. It’s fine, but it doesn’t feel very ""Chinese"" and is relatively pricey.
* **Qianwang Street** (钱王街): A touristy old town street that isn’t particularly special.

**Lijiang (丽江, 4 days)**

The old town here is basically a summary of typical Chinese tourism. If you visit, it’s worth doing so for the surrounding attractions like Tiger Leaping Gorge, Jade Dragon Snow Mountain, and more. The old town itself can be amusing for a day if you’ve never experienced Chinese-style tourism, but it feels like an artificial Disneyland. Some people recommend visiting Baisha, but it’s essentially the same, just more expensive and remote, which makes it harder to access the attractions around Lijiang.

**Tip:** I recommend staying just outside the old town. Cars aren’t allowed inside, so transporting luggage can be tricky unless your hotel arranges something. Plus, it gets so crowded at night that leaving quickly becomes a real challenge.

* **Jade Dragon Snow Mountain** (玉龙雪山): A towering, snow-covered mountain. While you can take cable cars to the top, I found it less appealing due to how popular it is. There are also several valleys worth exploring. Oxygen is very low at the top though so be carefull and consider using oxygen thanks to don’t get sick.
* **Black Dragon Pool** (丽江黑龙潭): Not incredibly impressive, but still fun, especially for running. You can also climb the stairs up the mountain nearby.
* **Lashihai International Wetland Park** (拉市海国际湿地公园): A peaceful area where you can find quiet spots or watch fishermen by the lake. This was one of my favorite spots, thanks to the lack of crowds.
* **Tiger Leaping Gorge Trail** (虎跳峡步道): While it’s often said to be a 2–3 day hike, i’m not sure why since the actually walking was around 4 hours for me. Keep in mind, though, that I didn’t do the descent to the river, I’m quite fit and I also took a 2 hour break for lunch since I met some lovely people mid-way. A single day is plenty for this trail I would say. A bus which a friend helped to book from near the old town dropped me off at the trailhead (I just stepped out when the rest of the hikers also did), where locals offered rides to the guesthouse starting point (for payment). At the endpoint (Tina’s Guesthouse), buses are available to **Shangri-La** or **Lijiang**, so logistics are straightforward.

**Dali (大理, 4 days)**

Dali is basically a chill spot for hipsters—lots of live music, laid-back vibes, and a super relaxed atmosphere. It’s mostly villages, a massive temple, and stunning landscapes, but not much else. I personally loved it because I could run next to the lake every day, but I get that this place definitely isn’t for everyone.

* **Caicun Village** (才村): This is where I stayed. People here mostly bike or run along the lake, which was great because it’s way less crowded than the center or the old town. That said, there’s not much else to do here.
* **Dali Ancient Town** (大理古城): Just your standard ancient town. There did seem to be a good amount of locals hanging out in restaurants, so it wasn’t as bad as some others I’ve been to.
* **Three Pagoda Temple** (三塔寺): Really popular, but yeah, it’s just pagodas. Not much else to say.
* **Chongsheng Temple** (崇圣寺): This temple is *huge*. Like, holy moly huge. Definitely impressive in that way.
* **Xizhou Ancient Town** (喜洲古镇): It’s got some very pretty valleys, but it’s also super touristy.
* **Shuanglang Ancient Town** (双廊古镇): This town sucked. Not much to do except wander through trashy commercial stores while golf carts honk constantly, trying to rush people onto boats. Definitely not a calm vibe.

**Shaxi (沙溪, 2 days)**

This was right when the national holidays kicked off, so I decided to head somewhere more remote. Shaxi is about a 90-minute drive from Dali, and honestly, I really liked it. It’s got a bit of a higher-class tourism vibe, and there were surprisingly quite a few foreigners around. The village is super pretty, but there’s not much to do beyond one full day.

* **Sifang Street** (四方街)
* **Old Theatre** (古戏台)
* **Yujin Bridge** (玉津桥)
* **Sideng Market Square** (寺登街集市广场)

Everything’s within a 5-minute walk, so just wander around and take it all in.

# Sichuan + Xi’an

Wanted something bigger again basically.

**Chengdu (成都, 4 days)**

I was here during the national holiday, so take my review with a grain of salt—your experience could be different if it’s less crowded. Overall, the sightseeing wasn’t super memorable, except for the pandas (if that’s your thing). Chengdu has a pretty big expat base, though, so the nightlife is amazing, with plenty of Western options and even some decent Western food. Here’s what I checked out:

* **Wuhou Shrine** (武侯祠): Not super exciting, but it’s on the list if you’re into historical sites.
* **Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding** (成都大熊猫繁育研究基地): This is *the* thing to do for Chinese tourists, so expect crowds. Honestly, the more I watched these creatures, the more it made sense to me why they almost went extinct—definitely not my thing.
* **Jinsha Site Museum** (金沙遗址博物馆): A bit more niche, but worth it if you’re into archaeology or history.
* **People's Park** (人民公园): There’s a marriage market here, like in most big city parks, but this one is funny because they just hang up standard applications which you can check at anytime. You can take your time translating them and laugh at the quirky ones.
* **Nanhe River** (南河): Great spot for biking. Stop by one of the tea houses along the river for a break.
* **Kuanzhai Alley** (宽窄巷子): Feels like a Lijiang copycat.
* **Jinli** (锦里): Also feels like a Lijiang copycat.
* **Anshun Bridge** (安顺桥): The area around the bridge is great for nightlife. There’s a nearby street (forgot the name) that’s is the main clubbing street it was next to the jellyfish club I remembered.
* **Tianhui Vanke Plaza**: This place feels like an attempt to push Chinese fashion brands, but some stores actually have pretty cool stuff.

**Xi’an (西安, 4 days)**

I absolutely loved Xi’an. Most places inside the city are super easy to bike to if your hotel is within the old city walls. There’s a lot to explore and wander around, and it still feels like you have a goal of hitting the main spots. Here’s what I checked out:

* **Muslim Quarter** (回民街): A bit touristy, but the food is great, and there’s a ton to try out.
* **Terracotta Warriors** (兵马俑): The most popular and absolutely a must-see. It gets *really* busy, so try to go early morning, lunchtime, or late afternoon on a weekday—and avoid Chinese holidays. Getting there is easy; I just took a DiDi.
* **City Wall of the Old Town** (西安古城墙): One of the largest of its kind and offers awesome views of the old town. You can rent a bike or even run along the top—it’s about 14 kilometers in total.
* **Shaanxi History Museum** (陕西历史博物馆): Definitely reserve tickets way in advance. I didn’t manage to get in because I hadn’t planned ahead.
* **Great Mosque** (西安大清真寺): A Hui-style mosque that I really liked. It hasn’t been over-renovated, so it still feels authentic.
* **Drum and Bell Tower** (钟楼和鼓楼): The towers themselves are cool, but honestly, the most fun part is biking around the roundabout that surrounds them.

**Chongqing (重庆, 5 days)**

I absolutely loved this place. The streets and alleys are way more chaotic, with tons of twists and turns, and it’s super walkable in the center—not the straight grids you see in American cities or even most Chinese ones. Food vendors are selling food basically 24/7. The skyline is hands down the most impressive I’ve ever seen. Also, while those viral TikToks show the most extreme parts of Chongqing, the rest isn’t as intense but is still so much fun. This place is also *very* Chinese—they’re not super used to foreigners yet, although more are coming thanks to all the TikToks and YouTube videos. Don’t expect much in the way of foreign food or clubs, and you’ll often hear “laowei” (老外, foreigner).

* **The Public Transport**: With the city’s unique terrain, even just getting around is an experience.
   * **Liziba Station (Line 2)** (李子坝地铁站，2号线): The iconic metro line that goes straight through a building.
* **Eling Park** (鹅岭公园): A 360-degree view of the city with a pagoda. However, it doesn’t capture the parts of the city with the light shows.
* **Testbed2** (二厂): A hip area with trendy shops and cool vibes.
* **Hongyadong** (洪崖洞): A tourist madhouse. I wouldn’t go inside again, but it’s worth seeing once.
* **Tongyuanmen** (通远门): Part of the old city wall. Some history here, but not super impressive.
* **Dongshuimen** (东水门): Another section of the old city wall—same story as Tongyuanmen.
* **French Hospital Ruin** (法国医院遗址): A small but quirky historical site.
* **Helipad on the 70th Floor of Union International Mansion** (联合国际大厦70楼直升机坪): The tallest building with the best top-down view of the city. You can even book hotels here, and the prices aren’t bad.
* **Art District** (涂鸦艺术区): Interesting spot, as you rarely see graffiti in China.
   * **Junge Bookshop** (君歌书屋): A cool bookstore near the art district.
* **Arhat Luohan Temple** (罗汉寺): A pretty big temple that’s great for photos, especially with skyscrapers poking out next to it.
* **Three Gorges Museum** (三峡博物馆): A classic government-supported museum. It’s high quality and worth a visit.
* **Jie Fang Bei** (解放碑): The main city center with the interesting buildings where you’ll probably want to book your hotel.
* **9th Street** (九街): Chongqing’s nightlife hub, packed every single night—Monday to Sunday—with Saturdays being the craziest.
* **Liu Jia Tai 0km Point** (刘家台0公里点): A good location on gaode maps close to another street with clubs.
* **Lao Jun Dong Taoist Temple** (老君洞道观): A bit far out, but it offers a great view of the city.
* **Gao Sheng Chuang Fu Center** (高盛创富中心): The place where all those TikToks are made showing how Chongqing’s streets feel like you’re on the first floor when you’re actually on the 40th. Pretty underwhelming I should say.
* **Hu Guang Guild Hall** (湖广会馆): Not entirely sure what it is, but it’s great for Instagram pictures.
* **Jiangbeizui River Beach Park** (江北嘴江滩公园): This park and the adjacent walking area (if it isn’t flooded) offer the best bottom-up view of the skyline. You can walk here from **Hongyadong** across the bridge or vice versa.

# Zhangjiajie (张家界, 3 days)

Extremely popular with foreigners, but honestly one of my least favorite parts of the trip. It’s basically just a concrete path where you take buses and lifts from one sightseeing platform to another, all the while thinking, “Oh yeah, this looks just like the pictures.” You have to get really lucky with the weather, and the worst aspects of Chinese tourism are in full force here. There also aren’t many off-the-beaten-path areas to escape to. Here’s what I did:

* **Zhangjiajie National Park (2 days)**: This is the main route that hotels will explain for a day trip:
   * **Elevator**: If the weather’s bad, you won’t see anything, and if the weather’s good but you don’t go early, lines can stretch for hours. This takes you up the mountain, where you can catch a bus to the Avatar Mountain sightseeing platform.
   * **Avatar Mountain Sightseeing Platform**: The most popular spot, so expect massive crowds. If the weather isn’t great, you might not see much at first, but it’s worth waiting for clouds to shift—you’ll usually get a decent view eventually.
   * **From here, you have two main options:**
      * **Tianzi Mountain (天子山)**: Another sightseeing platform that’s a bit less crowded. You’ll need to take a bus to get there.
      * **The Walk from Avatar Mountain Platform to Golden Whip Stream (金鞭溪)**: Follow the signs—it’s a walk down (mostly stairs) with some quieter platforms and nice views. Eventually, you’ll reach the stream, where you can walk alongside it for a bottom-up view of the mountains. Tour groups usually skip this part, so it’s way less crowded. Keep in mind that you’ll end up at Oxygen Square and the South Exit, which is a 20–30 minute bus ride away from Wulingyuan (the East Exit), where most hotels are located.
* **Tianmen Mountain (0.5 day)**: I was here during bad weather and couldn’t see anything from the top, but the stairs were fun to do quickly. It’s not a must, though. Be careful which tickets you buy—they have different routes, so you’ll either go up via the stairs and down with the lift or the other way around.
* **Zhangjiajie Glass Bridge & Grand Canyon (0.5 day)**: It’s just a glass bridge. Fun to check out quickly, but it’s not super impressive. It’s far from the rest of the attractions, pretty expensive, and very commercialized. If you want to do the via ferrata (also expensive by Chinese standards), you’ll end up in the middle of the canyon. From there, you either pay extra for additional attractions (like the slide down or another via ferrata) or take the stairs back up and down. The canyon itself isn’t that special.

**Longji Rice terraces, Yangshuo & Guilin (5 days)**

I didn’t expect much from this place after Zhangjiajie since the same crowd hopped on the HSR to Guilin, and I figured it would be a similar tourist trap. But I was pleasantly surprised—especially by Yangshuo, which was amazing. The people in Guangxi are incredibly patient, kind, and helpful, even compared to the rest of China. That said, they’re also pretty into eating dog, so don’t be shocked if you see a market stall selling dog meat.

Here’s what I did:

* **Longji Rice Terraces (龙脊梯田, 1.5 days)**: I stayed two nights but left on the second morning since there’s not much to do besides walking in the fields. After running through them, I felt like I’d seen everything. Definitely doable as a day trip if you’re not specifically looking to catch the sunrise or sunset. Food options are very limited, especially if you stay near the terraces themselves.
* **Yangshuo (阳朔, 2.5 days)**: I rented a scooter and explored the area. Once you get out of the city, you can find valleys and enjoy the stunning nature. The food here is also excellent. Here are the main attractions:
   * **Moon Hill (月亮山)**: This was closed for renovations, but there’s a nearby park with views of it. It was a bit underwhelming, though. If you keep driving, you’ll find some lovely valleys with great views of the mountains and farms.
   * **Xingping (兴坪古镇)**: By far the most touristy spot. It’s nice to scooter or walk next to the river, as there are some beautiful views. I got there by scooter, but it’s quite a long ride.
   * **Yangshuo TV Tower (阳朔电视塔)**: A 20–30 minute hike up to the tower offers stunning views of Yangshuo. You can even get inside the tower if you slip the lady at the entrance a few RMB. Great for photos!
   * **Langzi Village (朗梓村)**: A run-down village with some ruins that’s pretty far from Yangshuo. Not a must-see, but it’s a good excuse to hit the road with a scooter.
* **Guilin (桂林, 1 day)**: The food here is also great, and the people are super friendly. However, there’s not much that you can’t already experience in Yangshuo. Two things that are worth checking out:
   * **Elephant Trunk Hill (象鼻山)**: Not much to say here—it’s one of those “see it once” spots.
   * **Laorenshan (老人山)**: A short hike up a small mountain that gives you a nice view of the city.

You can use DiDi or ask your hotel to arrange a driver to take you to your next destination. If you go with the hotel option, you might be able to rideshare with other guests to split the cost. However, one thing to watch out for is that DiDi drivers in this area often demand you pay toll costs separately, even though tolls are already included in the DiDi app charges. Essentially, they’re double-charging you.

It seems like something they mainly do to Western tourists who might not know better. It’s a tricky situation because you know these drivers probably don’t have much to spare, and the extra money might not be significant for you, but it’s still worth being aware of—especially if you’re uncomfortable with these kinds of practices.

# Beijing, Pingyao and Tianjin (9 days)

**Beijing (北京, 3 days)**

I’d already spent some time here during a previous trip, so my main goal this time was running the marathon on the Great Wall. I kept it pretty easy and only explored the city center for one day—this could easily fit into a one-day itinerary. Everything I did was within biking distance:

* **Tiananmen Square (天安门广场)**: You’ll need to reserve a spot through the WeChat application. This was by far the most intense security I’ve ever seen—be prepared to wait in security check lines for 30–60 minutes.
* **Forbidden City (故宫)**: If you’re a foreign passport holder, you can buy tickets at the counter—no need to wrestle with the WeChat application that barely works for foreigners. The place is absolutely massive, so you’ll probably just get lost wandering around.
* **Jingshan Park (景山公园)**: Offers a great view of the Forbidden City, and it really gives you a sense of how huge it is.
* **Drum and Bell Towers (钟楼和鼓楼)**: The plaza between the two towers is super lively. You can also go up either tower for solid views of the city center.
* **Temple of Heaven and People’s Park (天坛公园)**: The park is very lively, especially in summer, like most Chinese parks. The **Temple of Heaven** (aka the Winter Palace) isn’t as large as the Summer Palace or the Forbidden City, but it’s fun to check out, and it’s pretty easy to get to.

Other things I did on my previous trip that I recommend:

* **Great Wall of China**: I visited the **Badaling section** the first time I went to Beijing. This section is very renovated and has a lift option. Transportation isn’t an issue—you can easily get a bus or DiDi if you’re decent at navigating. For more adventurous travelers, you can explore the more remote, less-restored sections of the wall. However, I’d recommend hiring a guide for those sections since transportation and access can be tricky. For the marathon, I ran at the **Zhangjiakou section**, which involved running up the mountain before reaching the wall itself.
* **Sanlitun (三里屯)**: The central business district where you’ll find big clubs and a lively nightlife scene.
* **798 Art District (798艺术区)**: A typical art district, fun to wander around if you like that kind of vibe.
* **Summer Palace (颐和园)**: A massive and beautiful site, but it’s located quite far from the city center.

**Pingyao (平遥, 3 days)**

I was pretty disappointed with this part of the trip. For some reason, there were an insane number of Dutch people here compared to the rest of China—I still have no idea why. The main activity is just walking around the old city, which has become pretty commercialized, and checking out a bunch of small historical buildings.

You buy one ticket that gives you access to all these historical places, but since they all look so similar and are a bit forgettable, you end up wondering if you’ve already been to a place or not. My advice is to just check the back of the ticket, which lists all the sights, or wander around and pop into places as you stumble upon them.

I’d say 1–2 days is more than enough to see most of the interesting spots.

**Tianjin (天津, 3 days)**

A lot of people gave me crap for visiting Tianjin, calling it just another generic northern city, but I honestly loved this place. I enjoyed it way more than my second time in Beijing. The city is a much more manageable size, so biking to all the spots is super easy, and the people are just overall nicer and more welcoming. Plus, the coffee culture here is surprisingly good, and it’s way more affordable than Beijing.

The main highlight is the colonial districts, which are really fun to bike around in—especially after spending so much time in China. Here’s what I did:

* **Five Great Avenues (五大道)**: The main colonial part of the city. Surrounding the old districts, you’ll find lots of interesting buildings too.
* **Italian Quarter (意式风情区)**: Super commercialized now, so I didn’t spend much time here.
* **Ancient Culture Street (古文化街)**: Felt like a repeat of Lijiang—definitely wouldn’t go back.
* **Jingyuan Garden (静园)**: Not super special, but it was nice to check out.
* **St. Joseph Cathedral (西开教堂)**: Aligns with the main shopping street, so it’s easy to visit while exploring the area. The area around it has most of the good restaurants and bars.
* **Porcelain House (瓷房子)**: It’s mainly impressive from the outside. Not sure it’s worth going inside, but the workers there seemed oddly excited to see me for some reason.

She ended it abruptly, basically over text and I was a MESS. She ended up getting into a new relationship quickly after me and they’ve been together since then. 

3 years later (current), I get a text from her asking if i’d like to catch up as friends. I agree only cause i’m curious what’s going on and why now. i’m fully healed and have moved on from her so i wasn’t meeting up with her with any hope or expectation. So.. we met up today for coffee. Come to find out, she’s single now. She started off by saying that she wants to be super honest with me and then started talking about our breakup and i guess when she left the country, someone had kissed her twice and she didn’t pull away and she said that’s why she broke up with me in such a cold way where she showed zero emotion. She said she’s felt so guilty and shameful about it and it’s been weighing on her. THIS WHOLE TIME. I was like okay 2 times.. 3 years ago.. no hard feelings at all. I just find it so strange that she’s still feeling all that guilt about it happening and so much time has passed by. She said her current breakup is still fresh and that she’s been depressed and honestly, she is not the same person I once knew. She looked absolutely drained. It was sad. She said her (now) ex knows about us catching up and was chill about it and also knew that her betrayal with me had been weighing on her. INSIGHT PLS. ",1,1737200750.0,actuallesbians,1,1.0,False

Yesterday, I submitted my first paper for the new semester (with copies to my friends Mrs. Weiss and Cardi). I've done a lot of papers for college and, before that, high school independent study. But this is the one I am most proud of.

It was in two parts. The first was an annotated bibliography of English-language online sources about Sara Schenirer and the Beit Yaakov movement. 

The second was a practical application of this bibliography. NYC is embarking on a mayoral campaign. I wrote an “open letter” to a hypothetical candidate introducing him/her to Sara's thoughts, using them to pattern a new education plan and winning the ultra-Orthodox community's support in the process.

Out of all of my sources, the most touching for me is [this speech](https://acrobat.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:VA6C2:dd0035fc-0567-4b70-a5fb-c930c2a4bf6e) of Devorah Cohn, who was one of Sara's students, 90-years-old at the time.

Now, to my dear sister Cardi: I have been following everything you posted here and on social media. I want you to know that I have your back a million percent. Have confidence in all of the decisions you and Robert have made. When you have doubts–and they will come up–imagine you are having coffee at a table with Ikeda Sensei and Sara Schenirer. You will instantaneously find the right direction forward! I love you with all of my heart!

**THE BACKSTORY**

It was between 2012 -2014 and me and my friend were just looking through my dad's computer to find some sort of song to sing along to. There were like hundreds of songs that we considered ""way too popular"" so we kept searching. That's when we discovered this song.

Well uh, it sorta failed because the singing is kinda ass, but we tried our best!

As a birthday gift, to make me happy, my dad managed to somehow download the audio and now we no longer had to go to YouTube every time just to listen to this one song. Like most people, we eventually grew out of it.

**NOW**

Me and Alex were just hanging around, doing whatever and then my mum called me and asked if I wanted to come over, and I said sure. After some more talking, she told me Alex could come over. And so we got over, spoke, had some tea and coffee and then I noticed my dad's computer and I asked my dad if me and Alex could use the computer for some nostalgia, like any sane person would. And then, would you believe it, we stumbled upon the file! After listening to it and having some flashbacks, I asked my parents this one question which I have no answer to today: Who made this song? They didn't know and we tried asking our other friends who sometimes also listened to this song and, of course, they didn't know. I took to Shazam but there was no luck. I tried ANY music identifying website to no avail. I did try getting a reddit community to help me identify this song 4 months ago, but they couldn't even find it.

**WHERE YOU MAY POSSIBLY COME IN**

Now, you could help me find this song! I'll provide the link to the full song and I'll give some lyrics to see if you could identify this song.

**THE BACKSTORY**

It was between 2012 -2014 and me and my friend were just looking through my dad's computer to find some sort of song to sing along to.

Coffee grounds activate Admiral Navy Bean and can be used as a cheap alternative if they let me go face with potted on turn 7.

Spring bean is an amazing card in this deck for obvious reasons. I’d be surprised if someone told me to switch it out.

The only real problem in this deck is banana peel. I don’t know what else I should use. Before i had banana peel, I used cosmic bean, which ngl is better but so frustrating to use bean evolution on.

1i45l81,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i45l81,AIO for how responded to an old best friend I had in college in 2019?,"[this is very long I’m sorry. I had a typo so I reposted] Hello, I (25f)  just needed some outside opinion on this as this interaction is just bothering me and I will tell you why, for the sake of this let’s call her Emery. This friend and I were  inseparable however as the friendship went along I realized she was my friend and I maybe wasn’t hers. This could be so detailed but I’m going to try to give you a good perspective of it as short as I can.

Her and I met in college(beauty school) back in the day we became friends very fast but where polar opposites. I was punctual and on time everyday and she was about 30 minutes late to morning lecture every time. She did not have the capability to get up when her alarms went off. At first this never bothered me but when people started saying things like “oh where’s emery? Is she gonna be late again?” And “what’s emerys excuse this time?” It began to get old because everyday was the same thing. Now I get on to the two things that’s really messed with me the most. 

One day it was a Friday after school and if any of you have been to Beauty school you know it’s full time. So I was at school from 8:30 am to 4pm and I had an overnight job 12am-8:30am on Friday nights so I went home from school and would toss and turn bc I had a hard time with this job and getting used to it. I was roughing it at my sister who let me rent a room in her home. 


So that night tossing and turning 7pm came around and I got a phone call from emery saying “hey I’m coming over” we where good friends so it wasn’t weird for her to hang out with me but she did know I was working so I was very confused. I let her in only to see she was very VERY drunk. Basically she came into my room and joked around and we hung out and around 9pm I started trying to see if she needed a ride home but she was being loud and my sister was trying to get my nieces and nephews down for the night.

As we where walking to the front door she drunkenly walked into my sisters room and started talking to her. So awkward yes i know, she was so intoxicated. I hurried us outside and into her car so we could talk more and long story short around 10 pm I told her I needed to work and I could take her home so I could come back and sleep bc I was exhausted and socially needed to recharge before my shift it gets overlooked pretty quickly bc she’s not very coherent. 

11:30pm comes and I’m anxious bc I haven’t even gotten ready for work yet, so the clothes I was in would have to do. She lets me drive her home but says I need to pick up her friend from a bar downtown(her house, the bar, and my job where about 7-15 min apart but it was a Friday night, incredibly busy).So I start the car and go and get her friend, by the time I pull up to the bar it’s 11:50 pm. I get them home and she tells me “take my car to your job and I’ll get it from you when you get off at 8 tomorrow.” So I do I thank her and I go to work only managing to be about 5-15minutes late. I clock in tired but feel happy that it worked out, my lunch comes around 5 am and I go to her car to catch a 30 minute nap bc I was running on empty at this point. 3 minutes into my lunch/nap she calls me and says she needs her car back in the next 15 minutes for something. I told her “oh I thought it was okay until 8?” She said she needed it Back asap and was already in an uber to my house to get it so I take it to my house go in and grab some things I forgot, get in my car and head back to work. That whole ordeal took me 20 minutes so I get back with 10 or less minutes to sleep, I wanted to cry at that point I was so tired but I finished my shift and I remember being so bummed and I felt very upset about it but I was super tired I graduated weeks after this. I saw her a few times after that and we went to Starbucks for coffee for about 30-40 minutes and she visited me in my apartment one time in 2020 and I went to hers that year. After that we talked one time as friends and she left me on read, the next interaction we had was me begging her in early 2022 to give me my cosmetology stuff back that I had lent her after I graduated in 2019. We went back and forth about that until April 2023 when she dropped it off at my door without texting me so it was out there for hours and tonight she texted me with the “are you alive?” Text. Truly the fact that I didn’t delete messages saved me bc I didn’t even have her number in my phone anymore. 

One of the times she texted me to drop it off(which she ended up ghosting me for another 6 months after this text) was a day before my birthday and I was excited bc I thought maybe she remembered and was going to surprise me but it was a random text and I didn’t hear from her again for a while. I have her birthday memorized, Infact when I thought about it tonight I didn’t even have to I just said her birthday because I never forgot. 

Thinking back to our friendship as a fully grown adult I feel like the person she texted is no longer me. It feels weird I have had insane things happen to me these last 5 years and I don’t even feel like the girl she used to know so I was taken aback by her response a bit. I feel like she was my friend but part of me now feels like I was her friend out of convenience bc we saw each other everyday due to school.  

We did try and I don’t regret it but I also felt disrespected a lot. In beauty school we’d do each others hair for grades and bc you could only work on a mannequin for so long before it got boring and I was very tender headed so when she’d do my hair she’d yank and pull and I’d say “emery please that hurts.” And she’d tell me to shut up or stop complaining and would keep going with the yanking. My head would hurt after she’d do it and I’d let everyone do my hair, I loathed when she’d do it bc I’d always have a headache from how rough she was with my head. Am I being a cold robot? Am I rude with my responses? Am I overreacting by being this way? Like I said I also feel very awkward because I feel like the person she’s talking to is gone?? It’s a weird feeling I don’t know.

Better than before .. i had really great energy and libido during cytomel.  
I just started euthyrox 150 mcg just 4 days ago and my cytomel now 25 mcg instead of 50 mcg. I take euthyrox and 12,5 cytomel together and another 12.5 cytomel i take evening about 6-7 pm.  
I dont feel any big difference other than libido and sex drive. This is normal ?

My doc told me he will raise my euthyrox to 175 mcg or 200 mcg after he see my blood test on 1 march ( after 4 weeks than rai) ane he said he wont stop my cytomel because im young and active person.  
Well i am 42 years old male ( dont know it really means young  really) and  I’m 95 kg.

my sex life will be normal  with euthyrox and cytomel as before ?

with cytomel i was great. I know levothyroxine will reach  its ideal levels in blood after 3-4 weeks while cytomel has instant effects.. i am very afraid ill have erection problems  and my libido wont be same as before. What is your experience about this ?

200 mcg levothyroxine And 25 mcg cytomel is too much ?

i take my levothyroxine About 4 am before sleeping , after 6-7 hours fasting. i wake up about 11 AM and take 12,5 mcg cytomel , wait 1-2 hours before eating or coffee. And another 12.5 cytomel i take about 6 pm.

I’ve been using my Breville Barista Express for a few years now and recently encountered an issue with the grinder. It’s taking noticeably longer to grind a portafilter’s worth of coffee. The grind quality remains consistent, but the process has slowed down. Additionally, during grinding, the machine occasionally emits sounds similar to when it runs out of beans, even though the hopper is adequately filled. It happened all of a sudden and to be honest I am suspecting that perhaps maybe I bought a lighter roast?

My lovely partner recently gifted me a Salter EK5240BO machine to help me get started with my espresso hobby. I’ve always had a passion for good coffee, and instant coffee just hasn’t been cutting it.

I was hoping someone with experience using the Salter machine could help me out with a few questions:

1. Is the portafilter proprietary? I’ve seen recommendations to upgrade to a naked portafilter—does anyone know if that’s possible with this machine?
2. I’ve read posts suggesting removing the metal casing on the frothing wand. If I do that, what should I replace it with?
3. I see so many people using puck screens. What’s the benefit? Is it mainly to prevent the coffee grounds from touching the machine?

I've also bought a WDT tool, a tampering station and a dosing funnel - my next upgrade is to get a berr grinder since i'm currently using a blade based grinder and i need to grind finer. Am i missing anything else?

Thanks in advance for your advice! 😊

I pluged it back in to make it ready for the morning.

A few minutes later it went dark in my appartement and my first thought was: ""The coffee machine :o""

Turns out, i must have accidently switched it on during cleaning...and because there was no water in, I didnt hear the boiler heating up... Now every time i plug in the machine (doesnt matter if turned on or off) my flat goes dark.

I did some research, and it seems like that if I change part nr. 13, i should be good to go? Its a \~2018 Model, so the heating group should probably not be toast?

She is the kind who doesn’t talk much. But when she starts to talk, she makes me wonder. We talked about many things on the very first day.

After the evening tuition class was over, she would walk all alone through a narrow road that ends up at the main road. I usually go back home on my Splendor bike. So, while I was riding back that day, I saw her walking alone. I stopped beside her and offered her a lift. But she said it was fine and told me she preferred to walk.

On the second day, I offered her a lift again, as it felt like the right thing to do. She politely declined again, saying she would walk. So I said bye, and she said bye back with a small smile.

On the third day, she surprised me by asking if I could give her a lift. I said, ""Why not?"" She climbed onto my Splendor, and we started moving. I noticed she was keeping a little distance from me, not even touching me. I couldn’t help but smile, though she couldn’t see my smile because of my helmet.

While riding, I asked if we could stop for some coffee. At first, she hesitated, but after a little convincing, she agreed. We headed to a small cafe in the city.

The cafe was simple, with 5 or 6 white tables. We sat down and ordered coffee. But I noticed something strange. she kept looking sideways and seemed nervous. I asked her, ""What happened?"" She whispered that the couple sitting on the other side of the cafe was her mom and dad, and they had already seen her.

Oh my God, I thought to myself. She looked scared. I wondered, Did I do something wrong? What’s so bad about two friends having coffee together? But she was clearly in fear. Her eyes said it all. She kept glancing at them and finally, in a rush, said, ""Njn pova."" Without waiting for my response, she stood up and left the cafe.

Now, I was sitting alone at the table, unsure of what to think. After a while, her mom and dad finished their coffee and came over to my table. Her dad looked at me, smiled, and asked, ""Ente makalude koode padikkune aano?""

I quickly replied, ""No uncle, tuition.""

He smiled and said, ""Aaha. Ithentha, coffeeo? Avalkku coffee ishtam allada."" After a short pause, he continued, ""Ntha onnum mindaathe?""

I replied, ""Nothing, uncle.""

He smiled kindly and said, ""Poor girl, she must have been surprised to see us. Avalkk shake okke ishtava! Next time, avalle villich oru shake vangich kodukk tto.""

With that, her dad and mom walked away, leaving me speechless. I never expected such a warm and friendly response from a girl’s father. His words made me feel relieved, and I finally caught my breath.

Oh, and I'm the worst kind of coffee snob - I know just enough about coffee to be a snob but not much past that.

Just spent 4 days in the parks and this is fresh on my mind.

The coffee at WDW is terrible - with one exception: the Kona coffee at the Polynesian.

Joffrey's and Illy coffee is far below average.  The coffee in the eateries is instant and that in itself is horrible.  To be fair, at the volume Disney needs to provide, instant is an economic choice since brewing takes time and people to pull off.  Some of the restaurants do have brewed coffee, such as Brown Derby, but that is the exception to the rule.

Starbucks is, IMHO, the McDonalds of coffee.  They actually don't sell much coffee at all, frankly - they sell a huge amount of flavored, sweetened milk instead, with a small amount of espresso thrown in for flavor.  I am such a snob that I don't count lattes as coffee.  Even Starbucks admitted a few years ago that their coffee needed to be roasted differently and that's when they came up with the Pike Place roast.  It is at least an average cup of coffee.

And oddly, McDonalds is IMHO one notch above Starbucks (but only one).  At least they serve their coffee actually hot and brew it instead of using instant like Disney.

But if you have traveled much at all, you know there is good coffee out in the rest of the world.  Kona from Hawai'i is spectacular and the Blue Mountain coffee from Jamaica is equally flavorful.  The entire nation of Italy can take the same beans that they purchase from the same farmers that supply Starbucks and make better coffee.  (As a gross aside, the civet 'processed' coffee is actually worth the price - if you get a chance and can get past your squeamishness, give it a try).

Despite all the options they have, Disney keeps selling the low end of the spectrum.  That drives addicts of coffee up a wall.

And now for rant 2:
It was cold this last week - jackets pretty much required, temps in the low 50s/upper 40s and not much sun through the clouds.  At several points, I wanted a cup of joe (even Disney coffee) to warm up.  

It was too hard to schlep around to find a kiosk that sells coffee!  I could find at least 2 ice cream kiosks staffed and opened for every one I found that had coffee, and believe me, the ice cream was NOT selling.

So to end on a constructive criticism note:  Hey Disney!  Remember the 1990s, especially in the Seattle/Portland/Vancouver area?  Remember all the coffee carts on the sidewalks?  When the temperature dips, maybe ""convert"" some of the ice cream stands to offer hot coffee instead.  I think that may be a win-win scenario.  (and brew the coffee in those stands).

Sicily. The name conjures images of sun-drenched beaches, ancient ruins, and… incredibly delicious street food!  Forget the fancy restaurants for a moment; the real culinary heart of Sicily beats on its bustling streets, offering a vibrant tapestry of flavors and aromas. And while arancini are the undisputed stars, the island has so much more to offer the adventurous foodie.

Let's embark on a delicious journey through Sicily's street food scene:

**Arancini: The King of Sicilian Street Food**

We can't possibly talk about Sicilian street food without mentioning arancini – those irresistible fried rice balls.  These aren't your average appetizers; they're little masterpieces of culinary artistry.  Each perfectly golden sphere hides a treasure trove of flavor, typically a creamy ragu, mozzarella, peas, and sometimes even mushrooms or prosciutto.  They’re crispy on the outside, molten on the inside – pure bliss in every bite!  You'll find countless variations across the island, so be prepared for a delightful surprise with every arancini you try.

**Beyond Arancini: A Street Food Safari**

But Sicily's street food scene is far from a one-trick pony. Prepare your taste buds for this exciting adventure:

* **Sfincione:** Forget your typical pizza; Sfincione is a thick, spongy pizza with a unique, slightly sweet tomato sauce, herbs, and often topped with onions. It's a hearty, satisfying treat, perfect for a lunchtime feast.

* **Pane ca' meusa:**  This intriguing sandwich features spleen and lung, seasoned with salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lemon. It sounds adventurous, and it is, but the textures and flavors are surprisingly delicious! Don't let the ingredients intimidate you; it's a local favorite for a reason.

* **Cannoli:** While often enjoyed as a dessert, these crispy, tube-shaped pastries filled with sweet ricotta cream are a street food staple, especially in Palermo.  Find a street vendor and savor the perfect blend of crunchy shell and creamy filling.

* **Granita:** Beat the Sicilian heat with a refreshing granita. This semi-frozen dessert comes in countless flavors, from classic lemon and almond to more adventurous choices like coffee and pistachio.  Often enjoyed with a brioche roll, it's the perfect pick-me-up on a hot day.

* **Stigghiola:** This is for the adventurous eaters!  These grilled lamb or goat skewers are a true taste of Sicilian tradition.  The meat is cooked over charcoal, giving it a smoky flavor that's hard to resist.


**Tips for Your Sicilian Street Food Adventure:**

* **Explore different towns:** Each town boasts its own unique specialties. Don't limit yourself to just one place.
* **Ask locals for recommendations:**  They'll point you to hidden gems and the best spots for authentic street food.
* **Go with an empty stomach:**  You'll want to sample as much as possible!
* **Don't be afraid to try something new:**  Sicilian street food is full of surprises, and most of them are delightful.
* **Enjoy the atmosphere:**  Street food is best enjoyed amidst the vibrant buzz of the local markets and streets.


So, pack your bags, grab your appetite, and get ready to experience the vibrant, delicious world of Sicilian street food.  It's an adventure for your taste buds you won't soon forget! Buon appetito!

1i459uk,https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/1i459uk/pre_hogwarts/,Pre hogwarts,"*This is the new beginning of my long story. My previous version didn't sit right. Petunia would never do what she did in my story. This is un edited. So far there really isn't any magic. I might add some in the edit. I feel this drags too long. I could do with some advice of what cut out.*

Harry knew he was stupid. The Dursleys told him everyday. His teachers confirmed it. Try as he might, his grades didn't improve. It was just so hard to concentrate when his stomach cramped with hunger. It was hard to remain calm when you slept on a camping stetcher with no padding, when your blankets were thin and itchy. How could anyone sleep well on an empty stomach? How could anyone be on their 'best' behaviour all day long. Harry's only safe space was his cupboard, and even there it was a ticking timebomb of Dudley jumping down the stairs, or Vernon bellowing, or Petunia ordering him to do chores.

The one saving grace that prevented him starving to death or failing school completely was the cheap school lunches, provided by the school. The dinner ladies could always tell the kids who didn't get enough to eat at home. Harry was one of the few kids who never complained about the grey beans, or the mystery meats.

Dudley would always try to tip Harry's tray as he exited dinner line. Doreen, the head dinner lady gave Dudley the exact required amount of food, the stingiest scoops of potatoes, the smallest portion of pudding. She loathed bullies like Dudley. When Petunia complained that her Duddykins didn't get enough food at school, the exact regulations were sent home. *'To ensure everyone gets enough food.... If this feels insufficient  you are welcome to pack food for your child.'* Petunia did. It was no trouble for her as she packed Vernon's lunch every day. Two large sandwiches, a piece of cake, cheese and savoury biscuits. There was also an apple but it was purely decorative, travelling back and forth each day. When the apple had travelled back and forth, the next day it was given to Harry, bruised beyond edibility. Every so often, Harry sneakily swapped out the old and new apple in Vernon's lunches. Ensuring he got a decent apple every second day or so. With Dudley doing the same Harry could get a decent apple every day. The bruised apples were then cooked down into apple sauce.

One day, Doreen let Harry sneak into the staff area in the kitchen to eat. When asked why by the headteacher, she said,

""His whole food tray ends up on the floor half the time. Makes lots of extra work for the ladies. So, I'm making him help with the dishes. He eats there where I can kept an eye on him. Can't run out to the playground if he eats there from now on.""

The headteacher found that not just acceptable, but admirable. Kids should be punished for making a mess. Harry was put out that they would punish him, when he was the victim. Soon he realised it wasn't a punishment. He quite enjoyed chatting to the ladies, he got extra food, got to use the spray hose to rinse dishes, and most importantly avoided Dudley. 

Martha let Harry out the back door, when she went for a smoke break. 

""You know 'Arry, some of us ladies are 'ere, for deliveries and set up, as early seven. Can always do with an extra set of 'ands. Sherry makes a big batch of porridge and builder's tea. Not fancy but it makes up for the early start. Give you an extra pudding too for 'elping.""

""Thanks Martha. If its OK with Doreen, I'll see you tomorrow morning.""

Harry headed off to class, his pockets stocked with a couple of plain, dry, biscuits. When Harry left at end of the school day, Dudley and his gang charged at Harry, just outside the school grounds. 

""Where were you hiding at lunch? You can't hide now.

Harry ran back inside the school. Unfortunately Doreen and the ladies were gone. Harry altered course and headed for the library.

Dudley tried to call Harry names, but he couldn't run and speak at the same time. It came out as a wheeze.

""No running in the library!"" Shouted the librarian.

""Sorry Ms Kirke. I wanted to grab a book before you left for the afternoon."" Harry said, puffing a little.

""You're in luck. The lego club is on tonight. I'll be here until 5pm.""

Harry glanced through the glass doors. Mr Gout, the mean deputy head, was scolding Dudley and his friends, probably for running. Ms Kirke saw where he was looking.

""Follow me. I have a book recommendation for you."" 

She lead Harry to a quiet reading area, with an uncomfortable sofa, and a storage room.

""Here. This is the Chronicals of Narnia. I particularly recommend the second story, 'The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.' Don't tell anyone"" she looked behind her ""this is my secret spot. Great place to read, or have a nap."" 

Harry looked around.

""Its hardly a secret.""

""Not that space. This one."" She unlocked the storage room. ""Welcome to Narnia Harry.""

Harry hadn't read 'The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.' He did know the basic premise. The storage cupboard unfortunately wasn't a magical snow covered world, it was instead a cleaning supply closet that had been refurbished into a cosy staff room. It had a much more comfortable two seater settee, a coffee table, several filing cabinets, on top of which was perched a kettle and a microwave. Hidden behind the open door was a small fridge,big enough for a pint of milk and a packed lunch, and not much else. The small room was packed tight but it was cosy.

""Isn't your office behind the main desk? I thought this was for cleaning stuff?"" Harry asked.

""When they added the library building to the  school, this room was on the plans. It made no sense to the librarian at the time. You see in the entry hall that connects the library to the main building has a cleaning cupboard. We can store stuff in the office area too. The librarian at the time, brought a few odds and ends in here. When they got new filling cabinets, the old ones were shoved in here. When my grandmother passed away I got the settee and the coffee table and brought them here. They just fit. You rest or read. I'll be back at five. Say bye if you leave earlier though.""

Harry ate his snack from the dinner ladies, and did his homework. He began to read but must have dozed off, because Ms White gently woke him at 5:00pm. The lego club had just finished packing up. 

When he returned to Privet Drive, Dudley was watching telly. 

""And where have you been?"" Petunia sreeched brandishing a wooden spoon.

""The library has a lego club every Thursday and..."" Harry was cut off by Petunia 

""You weren't at lego club Dudley would have seen you."" 

Dudley looked wide eyed.

""I didn't say I went to lego club. The library was open. I'm so far behind in my homework I stayed to do it. That way I wouldn't be taking up room on *your* kitchen table. I saw Dudley outside the library talking to Mr Gout, but I went to a quiet reading area in the back. So, Dudley wouldn't have seen me. I'm sure my favourite cousin would have waited for me if he knew where I was.""

Dudley looked relieved. Harry began moving towards his 'room'.

""You're just in time to do the other vegetables. I already did *your* job of peeling potatoes.""

""Ok"" was all Harry said. The lack of thanks infuriated Petunia. Harry went to put away his bag under his bed and changed out of his uniform. In order to stand up in his room, he had to fold the end of the camp bed up. The limited space made it arkward but he was used to it. 

For dinner, it was lamb chops, mashed potatoes, peas, carrots, and brussel sprouts. Which meant Harry would get smallest or the burnt chop, a small amount of veggies, and almost the entire bushel of sprouts. Harry cooked the chopped bacon in pan, then set it aside so Vernon and Dudley could add it to the potatoes. Harry cooked the sprouts in the bacon fat. Petunia despised sprouts, and thought she was punishing Harry. Vernon and Dudley avoided anything green. Harry loved brussel sprout night, but pretended it pained him. These were the rare nights he felt somewhat full. He could hardly believe it; Two pieces of slightly burnt toast for breakfast, his whole school lunch, a big dinner, and some bonus biscuits. This was the best day ever.

Harry adjusted the small light in his cupboard away from the door, so he could read without light peeking out the bottom of the door. He looked at the wall opposite the stairs, and wondered.

'What was on the other side of the wall?""

In reality it was the brick wall that separated the house and garage, but looking from the outside the measurements didnt seem to quite line up. This implied, to Harry, that there was unused space, if only he could access it.

He fell asleep as Edmund ate the turkish delight. He thought he'd sell out the Dursleys for less. He knew it wasn't true. Dudley hated Turkish delight, and Harry had tried it. It wasnt that good. 'Must have been mixed with a potion to do as the witch said.'

On Friday, Harry arrived at school early, Doreen and the ladies made porridge, and tea as promised as they took in the deliveries. Two other kids also helped out. They were siblings, their mother worked an early shift, but she couldnt afford out of hours care for her kids. Lewis and Alice were distant towards Harry, finally they admitted they were scared of Dudley's threat. If anyone played with Harry, 'they would be in for it' as much as Harry.

Harry went to the library after school again. Fridays the library closed at 4pm. 

""Have you got fun plans for the weekend? Maybe trick or treating? Or are you waiting for Monday?""

""No fun plans. I don't celebrate Halloween. What about you Ms Kirke?""

""I volunteer at the nursing home on Gilder Street on Saturdays. They're always looking for volunteers.""

""But what could I do?""

""I read to them. You can help serve meals, play board games with them, or just talk to them. Many don't get to see their families often. Some would love a bonus grand kid.""

Harry shrugged, but had no better plans.

After full day being properly fed, Harry didn't mind that his dinner was 'bubble and squeak' made from yesterday's veggies. He didn't even complain when Dudley swapped his veggies for Harry's sausage.

This made Dudley mad. 

""Thanks for the sausage Harry. You seem upset. Is Harrykins going to cry because I took his sausage."" Dudley said in a stage whisper

""No. My confusion is because I didnt know 'thanks' was in your vocabulary.""

""I took your single  pathetically small   sausage and thats all you have to say?""

""Yep.""

Harry ate quickly. 

""Harry took my bubble and squeak!"" 

""Did I? Here, have this big one. I can see it has plenty of sprouts and peas in it. Extra big, must be yours.""

""Did you take Dudley's food!?"" 

""No, Aunt Petunia. He dropped his on the floor. I couldn't let him eat that one. This one is much bigger and perfect for Dudley.""

Vernon went to clip Harry around the ear. Harry was faster. He cleared his plate and started washing the dishes.

""Careful. Big knives in soapy water. You'd have to take me to A&E, or let me bleed out all over your lovely kitchen. Not long now Vernon. Only 9 years 9 months and 4 days before we can be done. Give or take. You know I'm not the smartest kid, but maybe the army will still take me.""

""Lucky for all of us, they let you join the army at 16. They'd have to be pretty desperate to recruit you.""

Harry had no intention of joining an army, but figured nothing the army could throw at Harry, could be worse than staying with the Dursleys.  The upside of the army, was they provided housing. Harry's actual plan was to join an apprenticeship at 16. He had no strength in academics, so why bother continuing with school. Carpentry might be nice. Roofing could be a good fit too.

Saturday, Harry went to Gilder Street. Ms Kirke had photocopied a map for him, and given him instructions on what to do when he arrived. 'Alstroemerias Gardens' was a large, bland, utilitarian, U shaped building. Harry signed in at the reception. 

""I'm here for Ms Kirke's reading program?"" He hesitated ""Erm.... Is she here yet?""

""No, why don't you wait in the TV room, in the 'Daffodil room'.

A young auxiliary nurse led Harry to the room. It was empty, except for one old man. The auxiliary checked the room number displayed on his walker. 

""This is Mr. Burke. Mr. Burke this is..."" 

""..Harry."" Harry added helpfully 

""It's **Hodge** not Burke. I took my wife's name when we married."" But she paid if no attention and walked away.

""Well, Harry, you here to see your grandparents?""

""No, they all passed away before I was born or too young to remember.""

""Your parents punishing you for bad behaviour then hmmm?""

""No..."" Harry hesitated. Perhaps Mr Hodge didn't get along with his family. It was very unusual for a man to take his wifes name after all, especially since 'Burke' was a perfectly normal name. Harry decide to tell him the truth.

""My parents died in  car crash when I was a baby. It was my fault for crying too much. I live with my mum's sister and her family. I haven't done anything wrong as far as I know, but my aunt could find something. I got in trouble for shining my uncles shoes 'too much' last week. Still, I was only allowed to come because it would be an unfun time for me. They can't imagine spending time with old people who werent related. Even then, its because they have to.""

""Sit, sit, tell us the story. We don't get much entertainment 'round here. Even less pleasant conversation.""

""We?"" Harry looked around at the otherwise empty room.

Mr Hodge turned his photo around. A pleasant women smiled out.

""That's Emma. I am.."" He paused and wrote down  'Æthelred'

""If you can say it you can call me by my first name. I'll give you a hint, I was named for a King.""

Harry had never seen the letter 'Æ', but he gave it a shot.

""A-eth-el-red, A-Ethel-Red, Ath-L-read, Aay-thul-red""

""Close enough. I'm Red.""

""I'm still just Harry, it's not short for anything... but you can call me 'Blue'. I'm just kidding Harry is fine.""

""You play chess Blue?""

""No, chess is for smart people. I'm not... I don't think I'd understand chess.""

""You got anywhere else to be? I'm sure they'd like help cleaning toilets. We'll exchange stories of horrible family."" 

""So, you didn't like your family either?""

Red laughed. ""They called me Ethel. How much do you think they liked me. The king I was named for was Æthelred the unready! At least your parents cared enough to call you Harry!""",1,1737198174.0,HPfanfiction,0,0.67,False

1i451ci,https://www.reddit.com/r/googleads/comments/1i451ci/ad_copy_that_converts_three_lessons_from_spending/,Ad Copy That Converts: Three Lessons From Spending Six Figures Of My Own Money On Google Ads,"Howdy All

Lock in again ahead of the weekend for some more google ads sauce. In my last [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1hyp28j/5_things_i_wish_i_knew_about_google_ads_before_i/), I touched on the importance of good ad copy which prompted a lot of DM's asking me what exactly that meant. For those that are more advanced, this will be cakewalk, but I do hope this can serve as a useful guide to those that are new or are considering using google ads for their business. So without further ado, here goes:

**Lesson 1: Emotion + Facts: The Winning Combo**

* To create ad copy that truly converts, you need to speak to both the heart and the mind. All decisions, whether we like it or not, are largely emotional, with logic serving as post-action justification. The best-performing ads tap into this, combining emotional appeal with factual proof to compel action - emotions drive clicks and facts build trust (and in turn conversions). Great ad copy blends both of them together seamlessly.
* **Example:**
   * Emotional Hook: *“Tired Of Feeling Stuck In Your Career?”*
   * Factual Proof: *“95% Of Our 20,000 Graduates Landed A High-Paying Job In Tech Within 6 Months.”*
* **Pro Tip:**
   * Adjust the emotional & factual balance by your product / service niche and audience type. Low cost commodity physical products will require different language & tonality to say an enterprise software company for example. Find the emotional and factual balance that converts best for your audience, and scale those campaigns accordingly.

**Lesson 2: Specificity Will Always Beat Generalization**

* Now that we’ve covered the importance of emotion and facts, let’s talk about another crucial element - specificity. Generic half-hearted ad copy doesn’t just not stand out, it actively reduces trust. People respond to offers that make them feel heard. Being specific helps your ad answer the user’s subconscious question: *“Why does this ad deserve a click?”.* After all, you're also competing against a sea of often higher ranked organic results.
* **Example**
   * Generic: *“Reduce Joint Pain Using Our Proprietary Formula”*
   * Specific: *“Relieve Joint Pain By More Than 50% In Just 14 days - Clinically Proven And Trusted By 25,000+ Arthritis Sufferers Worldwide.""*
* **Pro Tip:**
   * Always include numbers to describe time saved, results achieved, or improvements made. Use data from real customer results and case studies to provide this type of specificity. Test out anchoring your offer to industry comparisons. By positioning your product against competitors you addresses the user’s implicit question: *“Why should I choose you over others?”*

**Lesson 3: The Importance of Contextual Relevance**

* Great ad copy isn’t just about what you say, it’s about saying it at the right place & time. Contextual relevance ensures your message resonates with the user’s immediate situation, such as their location, device or even time of day. When ads feel personalized to the moment, they drive higher engagement and conversions.
* **Example**
   * Not Contextually Relevant: *“Fast Online Coffee Order”*
   * Contextually Relevant: *“Hot Coffee Delivered To Your Office In Under 20 Minutes - Perfect For Your Afternoon Break.”*
* **Pro Tip:**
   * This is quite offer dependant but using geo-targeting and separating out your campaigns to make your ad feel local will always provide better results than not doing so. Tailor your messaging to align with user behaviour throughout the day and thoughtfully account for how mobile users interact with your ads differently than desktop users.

Now, all of this is well and good but it can only take you so far without a proper landing page that knows how to convert users. But I'll leave out that rabbit hole for another time... As always, if you have a question that you don't want to share publicly, DM's are open.

1i44xda,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverfifty/comments/1i44xda/another_second_date_attraction_question/,another second date attraction question,"After a first basic coffee date I had a second date with someone this week. We had a short dinner and then went to a local concert that I’d booked. We both loved it and were dancing occasionally. She quickly became more physical and almost immediately started to grab for my ass. I’m not a prude but I thought that was very forward and a bit too fast for me. I’m not sure if I feel attracted to her yet as I still barely know her. 

After the concert we went to a bar and had a few drinks, it was a good conversation and it felt relaxed and we both enjoyed it. I told her I wanted to go slow in dating and first get to know each other and she said she wants the same. So as we left I thought we would just do a simple goodbye kiss but boy, she really went for a big make out session. It was fairly enjoyable and I admit I participated, but afterwards I felt it was all a bit too much too soon. I think it may have been alcohol fueled on her part as well.

The day after she immediately texted she wants to meet again. She’s clearly attracted to me, but I’m really not there yet. I am not sure if my attraction will grow but she is a nice, smart, independent person so I think it could, but only if I get to know her better. I want to take some of the alcohol and romantic/kissing pressure off though, so I proposed to go for a day time walk and coffee this weekend (which she accepted).

People who have read my other posts know I can overthink and struggle to make the right romantic decisions. Especially in situations where the woman finds me attractive while I’m still figuring out how I feel. My teens and 20s were full of insecurity on my part and rejection by women, so I pretty much married the first woman who liked me. Now in my 50s I’m more confident and - apparently - more attractive at least to some women, but I am just completely clueless on how to deal with this. I know love at first sight is a myth so I feel I need to have multiple dates a chance, yet I also don’t want to lead people on. 

How do you guys figure this attraction thing out? Do you always know instantly? Would you just kiss even though you’re not attracted? Keep talking? Am I overthinking again? (I know the answer to that last one)",2,1737196736.0,datingoverfifty,8,1.0,False

It's a shitty stimulant that only lasts a few moments and destroys your body more than coffee and modafinil. They're infinitely more useful stimulants for my ADHD.

So what do I do? Any tips?

Dear Dr Roberts

Re: Ms Anne Hall
DOB: 19/09/1972

Thank you for seeing Ms Hall, a secondary school teacher, who presents with features suggestive of gastroesophageal reflux, with or without strictures. Your further investigation of her condition would be highly appreciated.

Ms Hall presented to me today with a complaint of dysphagia to solids, that started two weeks ago following a post-viral respiratory infection. For management of said infection, she self-medicated with an over-the-counter chinese herbal product whose contents remain undetermined. She has lost around 2kg of weight, and is also experiencing epigastric pain that radiates to the back. 

Ms Hall has recently increased her coffee intake. She does not smoke but drinks socially. She takes aspirin a couple times a month. 

I have advised the patient to limit her coffee and alcohol intake, as well as to avoid over-the-counter products. Additionally, I have prescribed her proton pump inhibitor (Pantoprazole, 40mg daily) for her symptoms. 

In view of the above, I would be grateful if you could help reach a definitive diagnosis by further evaulation and if required, an endoscopy. 

If you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Yours sincerely,

1i44qow,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1i44qow/family_problems/,Family Problems ,"So, this is obviously going to be a slightly biased post, but I’ll try and put both sides out and see what you guys come up with. 

Background: I am adopted by my mother, have severe ADHD and depression, was abused by my adoptive father mentally for multiple years.

I’m going to break this up into three points/parts:

Point One:

My mother adopted me when I was three. She did this knowing full well she has chronic anxiety and can’t leave the small town she grew up in. Which is arguably not great for a kid who was up for adoption under neglect and abuse. Not to mention, a year after or she married a guy who was clearly a narcissist and not a nice guy all-round. 

When it came to my teenage years, he got worse and took every teenage habit, personally. He punished me by banning me from showers, screaming in my face, turning off wifi, hiding things I needed. I’d say, worst of all was the screaming and public humiliation that he did, as it was deemed to the outside that I was just a dumb, ignorant kid. 

However, through this time my mum was umm-ing and ahh-ing about leaving him. I was getting school therapy at the time, so she regularly took me aside on a dog walk and asked me how I’d feel. I was mixed, as I think any kid with trauma would be. Another house? Another loss of family? She also wanted me to share a room and basically lose any benefits that our current house had. She had no job, no money and it just didn’t work, in my teenage head. I never said no. I showed concern that I’d miss all my things and was a little hesitant. 

Fast forward to my early twenties, when he’s left us, she’s still got no job and is just swimming on in life. Whenever we talk about the past, she regularly will claim and say bluntly how she was told by the school councillor, the teachers and other professionals, that we needed to leave him but I was the problem, as she wasn’t sure if I’d come with her. Now. I was 14-15 at the time. I did not get on with my dad. I also was praying for my mum to do something. Yet, fast forward, she’s put all of it on my shoulders. She claims that due to me being hesitant, she just couldn’t do it, as she wasn’t sure if I’d join her. Now, on the outside, it sounds innocent. But everytime it comes up, she asks me why I was hesitant. A little bit of a broken record. And she always says, “How sad”… 

Point 2:

With my previous point in mind… My mother is a devout Christian and has always been eager to share her faith. Standard and understandable. However, with this, has come a blurring of relationship, as she has decided to want to ditch the mother and son relationship (which was fairly redundant anyway) and call me her friend and brother in Christ. Ew. Not for me. 

This has come with quite a few complications as, even though I’m a young guy, I want a mum. I’ve had a really shit time as a kid and in my young adult-hood. I kind of assumed that an adoptive family would have been vetted more? However, this dynamic has meant that she wants to discuss MANY very personal topics that I, personally, am not comfortable with. However, whenever I explain this and vocalise my opinion, she does take offence.

With this said, she has recently become very bitter and opinionated. Or at least, now she’s more vocal about this. Which is a shame, as when I was younger, I saw her as quite hospitable. 

But she has burnt SO many bridges over misunderstandings, differing of opinions, etc etc. She no longer has a church she likes in the local area. She takes EVERYTHING personally and needs extra extra reassurance. Again, I don’t want to pile in on her anxiety, but I feel as if it’s worth mentioning. 

Point 3:

This is the more mixed bag. When all of this was at its peak, I fell into some really toxic habits. I was NOT in a good way. I got into a hefty bit of debt. However, as my mum had plenty of her own problems, I wasn’t about to involve her in this information. 

I found myself out of uni, unable to drive, unable to get myself out of this hole that was QUICKLY forming. So, I went looking for cheap cars and, as my mum was getting a decent divorce settlement she decided to offer her hand. Granted, she didn’t know about my debt. She said I must pay back ALL of the money. I was always a bit insulted by this, as a year prior she had said that she’d buy me a car up to a certain limit once I passed my test. However, she claims that had a time limit on it. Which is strange, as she never told me that. Anyhow, I agreed as I was in murky waters and desperate to escape the town.

One of the agreements we had, was that the reason she offered it to me, was that she didn’t want me to have to pay interest or feel pressured to pay it back fast. So, I took that as a very chill agreement, as a ‘retribution’ for the past few years. A starting block perhaps? 

Fast forward to now, I’m NEARLY out of debt. I’ve paid a majority back to her. Woo! I’ve been through a breakup, I’m starting a new job, etc. I treated myself to a relatively cheap tattoo with some of my savings. Bare in mind, I don’t go out, I don’t drink  and in the evenings, she has carers to help her anxiety, and she’s been asking me to fill in to save money. Arguably unfair on me, as I love being out I the evenings, at the gym, with mates, etc. But I agreed, as she’s helped me out. However, whenever I see her, she complains about anything and everything. She doesn’t have a job, and the mess she’s made for herself has basically meant that the tattoo is now a contentious point as she thinks every spare penny I get, needs to go to her. This was never the agreement, it also wasn’t that expensive and, considering she still hasn’t given me any Christmas present, I thought was pretty damn valid. However, she has mentioned it EVERYTIME I see her. I go downstairs for a coffee, she mentions how unfair it is. I walk in to offer her some food, she asks me questions about it. 

She even accused me of lying about paying for the tattoo, as apparently she googled the shop and the prices. Which, to me, shows such a warped relationship view.

Now, I know this was long. I apologise. I’ve also missed out SO MANY details. Life hasn’t been easy and it’s been a weird ride. Guess it was nice to vent at least. You can call me the asshole, but be constructive too 🫶🏻
