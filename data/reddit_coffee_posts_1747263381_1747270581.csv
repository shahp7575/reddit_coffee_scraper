**Pan-romantic Ace and proud!** Emotional connection is my love language—physical stuff is strictly DLC, not base game. Ask me anything!

**Forever DM & LARPer**—If your ideal date involves:

- Rolling nat 20s on flirting checks.
- Debating whether ""Lawful Neutral"" is code for ""boring.""
- Overnight LARP events where we pretend we’re not freezing in a tent.
- Crying over fictional characters like it’s our job.…then congratulations, we’re already fanfic OTP material.

**Writer & Professional Story Goblin**—I hoard tropes, re-tellings, and character arcs like a dragon with a Kindle Unlimited subscription. Romance? Love is Blind scenarios? Fresh spins on classic tales? YES. (Bonus if you want to rant about them with me after.)

**Magic: The Gathering Commander Player**—I enjoy:

- Politicking my way to victory.
- ""Friendly"" games that last 4+ hours.
- Arguing whether counterspells are evil (they’re not; cry about it).

**Media Snob with a Heart of Gold**—I’ll tear apart a lazy comic adaptation with citations, but I’ll also cry at a well-done romance subplot. Fight me (or join me; yforgetting.

**Neuro-divergent mess**—Even simple concepts can confuse me. Will ask alot of clarifying questions even if they have obvious answers. Tend to repeat questions a day or week later due to fogetting.

**Trans Woman**—Proud, open, and living my best life. If that’s an issue, exit stage left before I cast ""Power Word: Cringe"" on you.

**No Casual Mentality**—I’m here for the epic romance arc, not a filler episode.

**Adventure or Bust**—I need someone who actually leaves the house. Yes, cozy nights are great, but if your idea of excitement is only marathon shows, we might not vibe. Road trips, Ren Faires, hiking, spontaneous day trips, or even just exploring weird little towns? Let’s go.

**Quest Completionist**—My main quest is to get married and adopt a child. If you do not want to eventually complete that quest with me, please do not ask to join my party.

# **Why I’m Objectively Awesome (According to Me & My Cat):**

- Officially dubbed **""The Most Adorable Human""** (*Source: My mirror. My cat. Peer-reviewed.*)
- **Empathetic listener + hype woman**—I’ll remember your niche hyper fixations and send you memes so specific, you’ll question reality.
- Matching Ren Faire/cosplay outfits? Done. Themed date nights? Obviously. Reading fanfic aloud dramatically? Already warming up my voice
- I will learn your ""useless"" fun facts and weaponize them later to make you smile.
- **My love language is physical touch**—translation: I cuddle like it’s my divine purpose.

# **Deal-Breakers (AKA ""Don’t Waste My Time""):**

- **Smoking/vaping or excessive drinking.**
- **Long-distance** outside driving range of **Northern Ohio** (*I’m flexible, but if flying is your only option, hard pass*).
- **Skipping the safety video call** within the first month (*non-negotiable; Not falling for that again!*).
- **Homebodies who never want to explore**—I need a partner-in-crime for actual adventures, not just couch quests.
- **Throwaway accounts**—If your account is less than 3 months old with nothing on it, do not message me. *It basically screams, red flag to me*

# **You Might Be My NPC (Noteworthy Partner Candidate) If You:**

- Believe in ""us against the world"" energy.
- Geek out over D&D backstories, RPG character creators, or Commander deck tech.
- Want someone who’ll bring you tea and listen to your latest 3 AM hyper fixation rant.
- Appreciate **ace-spectrum identities** and emotional intimacy.
- **Love spontaneous adventures**—whether it’s a midnight diner run, a weekend hike, or a last-minute road trip to the world’s largest ball of yarn.

# **The Quest:**

If you’re kind, emotionally mature, and ready to build something real, **message me:“Hi” + your favorite animal + where you read this** (*or I’ll Wild Shape into someone who ghosts you*).

## **Bonus XP if you:**
- Know your D&D alignment with certainty.
- Have ever cried over a fictional relationship.
- Want to argue about MTG’s color pie over coffee.

Let’s write a story where we both get the happy ending. (*And maybe a few detours along the way*)

Every day, I see people curled up in doorways, needles scattered like confetti, and paramedics rushing to yet another overdose. It’s gut-wrenching, infuriating, and honestly, I’m exhausted from pretending it’s just “part of city life.”

What the hell happened? Toronto used to feel like a place where you could dream big, but now it’s like the streets are screaming for help. Homelessness isn’t just a “problem” anymore - it’s an epidemic. Walking to work in the morning, I saw a guy OD’ing on Yonge Street last week, convulsing while a crowd just stood there, filming or looking away. I couldn’t sleep that night. How is this normal? How are we okay with people dying in broad daylight while we sip our Tim’s and scroll X?

The drug crisis is out of control. Where’s the support? Shelters are overflowing, waitlists for rehab are a mile long, and harm reduction sites feel like band aids on a broken leg. I read somewhere that Toronto’s spent millions on “housing initiatives,” but I’m still tripping over tents in Moss Park. Where’s the money going?  Fancy consultant fees?

In closing, I’m not heartless nor trying to be cute. I’ve given change, bought coffees, even sat and talked with some folks. Their stories break me - lost jobs, abusive homes, one bad break after another. But my spare change isn’t fixing this. This city needs real solutions, affordable housing that isn’t a pipe dream, addiction programs that work, etc. Sorry, but not sorry for my long rant. ",0,1747270434.0,toRANTo,0,0.5,False

I sat on my couch, laptop on my knees, the same one I’d used for years in coffee shops, dreaming about *my* business, *not* someone else’s. But every time I thought about forming an LLC, all I saw were dollar signs. Legal fees. Filing fees. Registered agent costs. I didn’t have.

I felt stuck in a loop: I couldn’t afford to start and move forward without starting.

Then I found [**HolyShitLLC.com**](https://HolyShitLLC.com). And no, I didn’t believe it at first either. A *free* LLC? With a registered agent and an EIN? It sounded like a scam. But desperation mixed with curiosity, and I clicked.

Within minutes, my doubt turned into hope.

They weren’t joking. No hidden fees. No fine print traps. It was real. I followed the steps, heart pounding, fingers trembling, waiting for the catch that never came. I filled out the form, hit submit, and just like that, I was the owner of a real LLC.

For free.

You have to understand. I wasn’t some savvy entrepreneur. I was someone with a dream, too scared to take the leap. I thought I needed a lawyer, an accountant, and a thousand-dollar budget. What I really needed was a push, and this site gave it to me.

Why does this matter so much?

Because the minute I got that confirmation email, everything shifted. I *was* my boss. I had an LLC. I had a name, a structure, and a legal identity. And with that, I had confidence.

I registered my domain that night. I created a logo. I opened a business bank account the next morning. Within a week, I had my first sale. And then another. And then a repeat customer. Was it easy? No. But it was real.

And none of it would have happened without that *one* decision.

I don’t care if your business idea is selling stickers, coaching clients, flipping furniture, or building the next big app. If you don’t take the first step, you’ll stay stuck in that loop, watching others live the life you want while you tell yourself “someday.”

[**HolyShitLLC.com**](https://HolyShitLLC.com) didn’t just give me an LLC—it gave me my start. And if you’re still hesitating, still talking yourself out of it, stop.

Do it.

Right now.

Click the link. Start your LLC. For free. No excuses.

That night on the couch, I had no idea how much power lived in one click. You might not either. But trust me—you’ll never forget how it feels to finally say: *This is mine. I built this.*

I try to enjoy things in moderation and not restrict, but since I only have so many calories AND i have a protein/fiber goal to reach, I just don’t have the room most of the time for the foods I actually really crave. Yeah, I’ve found lower-calorie alternatives I enjoy or every once in a while I’ll be able to fit in a really small portion of the higher calorie food I actually crave, but it’s rarely ever enough to fully satisfy that craving. Sometimes you just want the real thing—not some high protein cottage cheese low calorie DIY version of it— and you want to enjoy an actually satiating amount of it instead of only eating a tiny portion. 

For dinner, my choices are either Indian food, Mexican food, or Italian food. The Italian restaurant thankfully has their calories listed, and if I get the meal I actually want + the sides, it’s 1,300 calories total. But then of course factor in one or two pieces of the free bread and olive oil, and then my family is gonna wanna get the free birthday dessert…my maintenance is 1,800, so I could def fit it in, but it really leaves no calories for any time earlier in the day unless I don’t eat half my meal or if I order the lowest calorie meal that I don’t actually wanna eat nor would I enjoy all that much. I’m so bad with portion control at these types of restaurants as well :( and a local coffee place near me gives out freebie drinks on birthdays (kinda like starbucks lol), so I was considering treating myself with a 200 calorie latte, but I might just have to cut it out for the sake of dinner. Especially if I end up going for Mexican food or Indian food where the portions are huge and calories aren’t listed anywhere. 

I thought maybe I could designate 400-500 calories max for earlier in the day, but it would still probably have me over maintenance. I just hate the idea of being hungry all day especially since I was planning on doing a chest/tricep workout and hoping to reach my step goal.

I was always an easy target for violence. I would get beat up by classmates and then come home with scratches on my neck because I made a small mistake. I felt vulnerable and unable to do anything in response, and they continued to destroy me inside.

I have always had problems communicating with my peers and other people. I had big problems that I wanted to tell another person, but I just couldn't. 

I was afraid to tell my parents my feelings, which were slowly destroying me. They never believed my words, I was upset.

I started having nightmares, thoughts of murder and thoughts of killing myself as early as the age of 6-8. They were very intrusive. 

I was more afraid of the dark than of a fatal blow, I felt like I was being watched. I thought someone wanted to kill me.

And the violence became more intense every year. I hadn’t yet thought about what awaited me in the coming years.

I turned 12. They started beating me every day. Do you think I'll get better? I don't think so.

I was afraid to tell my parents even the most ordinary things. I was very lonely at the end of the year, I had no friends anymore.

I was constantly forced to do things I didn't want to do. I had no desire to help those people who hate me.

I turned 13. I found new friends, new experiences and a person who was ready to listen to me every night.

June. I start communicating less and less with people and devoting time only to myself. I started having suicidal thoughts. I started having headaches.

July. I have no friends anymore. I go out even less often now than before. I start listening to a lot of music.

End of August. I tried not to sleep for 14-15 days. 

September I drink a lot of coffee in the evening and then suffer from pain all night.

And in the following months I changed my musical taste, I began to ask myself a lot of questions and engage in self-development. And during this I came up with a plan for suicide. I was plagued by nightmares every night, I began to delve even deeper into my past and I began to think about killing people.

I drank several more cups of highly caffeinated coffee over the course of 6 months.

I started having pain in my heart and kidneys. I have lost the meaning of continuing my life.

\[If you want the truth, he's with her. Royalton Hotel. Suite 805.\]

No name. No context. Just the message that ignited the fire already smoldering in Seren's chest.

She stared at the message for five minutes before grabbing her coat.

Room 805. Her heart pounded so hard it drowned out every rational thought.

Cass's voice, muffled but unmistakable, filtered through the crack in the door. A low chuckle followed -Rhett's.

Seren's stomach twisted. She had heard that laugh before, but not with her. Not for her. Not in a long time.

A sick sort of amusement flickered across Cass's face when she saw Seren. But Rhett, he looked destroyed.

""Seren,"" he breathed, stepping forward, but she took a sharp step back.

""Don't."" Her voice was barely a whisper, but it sliced through the space between them like a knife.

Rhett shook his head, his expression desperate. ""It's not what it looks like.""""I swear, I would never-""""Never what, Rhett?"" Her voice cracked. ""Never betray me? Never choose her over me? Or stand in a hotel room where she is practically undressed next to you?""\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The scent of fresh-brewed coffee drifted through the quiet kitchen, mingling with the soft hum of the old radio Seren had forgotten to turn off. It played a song she used to love, back when she believed in things like forever and promises that didn't break. She stood by the window, her fingers wrapped around the warmth of her mug, watching the small-town morning unfold beyond the glass.

Willowridge was the kind of place where people knew your name, where love stories didn't just exist in books but in the way old couples still held hands on their evening walks. She had believed hers would be one of those stories. For a while, it was.

""Morning, baby."" Rhett's voice, thick with sleep, wrapped around her from behind, his arms finding their familiar place around her waist. His lips pressed against the curve of her neck, lingering as if he wanted to pull her closer but knew she wouldn't let him.

She leaned into him, just for a second. Just to remember.

""You're up early,"" she murmured, tilting her head slightly but not quite meeting his eyes.""Couldn't sleep."" He buried his face in her shoulder, breathing her in. ""You weren't there.""

Her chest ached at the rawness in his voice, but she kept herself still, kept herself guarded.""You're barely here either,"" she said softly, not as an accusation, but as a truth they both knew.

Rhett sighed, his grip on her tightening before he let go. ""Cass needs me to look over the blueprints before we finalize the project."" The name sat heavy between them.

Seren forced a nod. ""Of course she does.""

Rhett ran a hand through his messy brown hair, already hearing the argument before it could start. ""Don't do this, Seren. You know I hate when you shut down like this.""

She let out a tired breath. ""I'm not shutting down. I'm just... tired.""

His face softened, and for a moment, she saw the man who used to chase her down rainy streets just to peck her, who used to whisper in her ear that she was his greatest love. The man who, deep down, still loved her.

""I know I've been caught up with work,"" he said, stepping closer, ""but you're my home, Seren. That hasn't changed."" She wanted to believe him. God, she wanted to. But Cass was always there, always at his side, and no matter how much he loved her, Seren couldn't ignore the weight of always coming second.

She offered him a small, sad smile. ""I should get ready for work."" He hesitated, like he wanted to say something more, but instead, he let her go.—

Seren's small boutique was a labor of love, a space filled with soft fabrics, delicate embroidery, and little details that spoke of her soul. She had built it from the ground up, pouring herself into every design, every stitch. It was hers. A place where she wasn't just Rhett's wife, where she wasn't overshadowed by the ever-present shadow of Cassian Lovell. ""She stopped by again,"" Emilia, her assistant and best friend, said as soon as she walked in.

Seren sighed. ""Cass?"" Emilia nodded, her expression turning sharp. ""Pretending to be all sweet, asking about a dress for some charity event, but you know what she really wanted? To remind me how 'fortunate' you are that she's always looking out for Rhett.""

 Seren let out a humorless laugh, unbuttoning her coat. ""Of course."" ""She does it on purpose, you know. To get under your skin."" ""She doesn't have to try very hard.

""Because Cass wasn't just his best friend. She was his person, the one he ran to with his troubles, the one he called first when something big happened. The one he listened to, even when it meant disregarding Seren's feelings.""She's in love with him,"" Emilia said bluntly. ""She always has been.""Seren closed her eyes. ""I know.""The problem was, Rhett didn't. Or maybe he did and just didn't care.

—That night, Seren didn't wait for him to come home. She curled up on their bed, staring at the ceiling, listening to the sound of the front door opening sometime past midnight. Rhett moved through the house like a ghost, his footsteps careful, almost guilty. She heard the clink of his belt as he unbuckled it, the rustle of his shirt hitting the hamper. Then, silence. She could feel him standing there in the dark, watching her, probably wondering if she was asleep. A part of her wanted to turn over, to reach for him, to ask him if he ever noticed the way she was slipping away. But she didn't. Because love shouldn't have to beg to be seen.

Instead, she whispered, ""Do you ever think about how it used to be?""She didn't know why she asked. Maybe she just wanted to hear him say it, to confirm that the magic wasn't something she had imagined.Rhett exhaled, sitting down on the edge of the bed. ""Every day.""Seren swallowed hard. ""Then why does it feel like we're losing it?""He reached for her hand in the dark, his fingers threading through hers. ""We're not.""She let out a bitter laugh. ""You missed our anniversary, Rhett.""His grip on her hand tightened. ""I know, Seren, and I hate myself for it. You think I wanted to? Cass—""

""Cass needed you,"" she cut in, her voice trembling. ""She always needs you. But what about me, Rhett? When was the last time I needed you, and you actually showed up?""Rhett's jaw tensed, and in the dim glow of the moonlight filtering through the curtains, she saw the conflict in his eyes. ""It's not like that,"" he said, shaking his head. ""You know it's not.""

""Then tell me,"" she challenged, sitting up now, the weight of every missed dinner, every unanswered text, every I'll make it up to you sitting heavy on her chest. ""Tell me why I spent our anniversary alone, staring at a cold dinner. Tell me why I keep feeling like an outsider in my own marriage. Because if it's not like that, then what is it like, Rhett?""His breath hitched. ""Seren, I love you.""Tears burned the back of her throat, because she knew he did. That was the tragedy of it. She knew that he loved her, but love wasn't enough if she was the only one fighting to hold them together.""I know,"" she whispered. ""But sometimes, love isn't the problem. It's everything else.""He reached for her then, pulling her into his arms, pressing a desperate peck to her hair. ""We'll fix this. I'll do better.""Seren wanted to believe him. Maybe once upon a time, she would have. But now, she wasn't so sure.

Seren sat on the porch swing, wrapped in her blanket, staring into the mist-covered street. The town was still quiet, but inside her mind, there was no such peace. Sleep had been slipping further from her grasp lately, the weight in her chest growing heavier each night. She heard the front door creak open. She didn't turn.

Rhett stepped onto the porch, his hair a mess, his shirt wrinkled—like he had crashed on the couch again. Like they weren't even sharing a bed anymore.

""You're up early,"" he said.Seren took a slow sip of coffee. ""Didn't sleep much.""He hesitated, rubbing the back of his neck, before sitting beside her. The porch swing shifted under his weight.

""I was thinking we could go to dinner tonight,"" he said, his fingers tapping against his knee. ""Make up for last week."" She turned her head, raising an eyebrow. ""Last week? You mean our anniversary?"" A muscle ticked in his jaw. ""Seren, I told you—""

""You were with Cass."" His lips parted like he wanted to argue, but she saw the flash of guilt in his eyes before he looked away. That familiar silence stretched between them—the one where she waited for him to say something, anything, to make this better.

He didn't. Seren exhaled sharply, setting her mug down. ""I need you to be honest with me, Rhett. Am I even a priority to you anymore?"" His head snapped toward her. ""What kind of question is that?""

She let out a hollow laugh. ""A fair one. Do you even realize how many times you've chosen her over me? How many missed dinners, how many times I've gone to bed alone, how many moments I needed you, and you weren't there because Cass needed you more?""

""That's not true,"" he said quickly. ""Isn't it?"" she shot back, eyes flashing. ""Then tell me, Rhett, how many anniversaries have we spent together? Because I can count exactly one. And it was the first one.

""He flinched. ""Seren, you're making this sound like—""""I sound like a woman who is exhausted from fighting for scraps of her husband's attention,"" she cut in, her voice shaking. ""Like someone who has been patient. Too patient. And for what? Just to watch you drop everything every time she calls?""

""She's my best friend, Seren. She's—""""I'm your wife."" Her voice cracked. ""Or did you forget?""

His brows pulled together. ""Of course not. Don't twist this into something it's not.""She swallowed hard, shaking her head. ""I don't have to twist anything. It's been clear for a long time now—

Cass doesn't respect me, and you let her get away with it."" Rhett let out a harsh breath. ""Come on, Seren, that's not fair. Cass has never disrespected you."" 

Seren scoffed, the bitterness finally bubbling to the surface. ""You don't see it, do you? The little jabs? The way she smirks when she gets to you first? The fact that she never once considers how her constant presence might affect our marriage?"" He rubbed his temples, his patience clearly thinning. ""She's not doing it on purpose."" She let out a shaky breath, staring at him like she was seeing him for the first time. ""That's the problem. You always give her the benefit of the doubt. But me? I have to prove I'm not overreacting."" He was silent again.

Seren forced down the lump in her throat. ""I can't do this anymore, Rhett. I can't keep feeling like I'm second place in my own marriage."" The words hung between them, heavy and suffocating. For a second, she thought—hoped—he would say something to fight for her. To fight for them .Instead, he ran a hand down his face and muttered, "" Seren, I can't have this argument right now."" And just like that, she felt something inside her crack.",1,1747269219.0,novelsfree,0,1.0,False

Hey. I’m writing this at a weird hour, because loneliness doesn’t respect office hours, and sometimes you just need to admit to a stranger that you’re not okay.

I’ve been feeling pretty lost lately behind in life, behind in academics, and ahead only in self-doubt. I keep thinking I should have it all figured out by now… but I don’t. And maybe you don’t either. Maybe that’s okay.

I’m not here for fleeting chats or curated selfies. I’m hoping to find someone who wants to build something a little more real. Something slow, imperfect, and honest.

I clean my CPAP stuff. I meditate (which I am essentially told I have to do in order to manage mental health issues that I struggle with - looking at life in the world schedule-istically, I wonder why!), just 5 minutes of meditation. I work out for an hour (5 minutes of stretching, 10 minute warm-up, a half-hour of working out, and a 15 minute cool-down). Shower up real quick. I make breakfast and coffee. I eat breakfast and drink my coffee. Brush my teeth. Do the dishes. Use the bathroom, get ready for the day, get dressed for work and grab the things I need and head out the door and get to work. I get to work at 9. 

I work until 5. I get home at 515, STARVING (I don’t get a lunch or have any time at work to eat). I start cooking, I have dinner made by 6. I sit down and eat - it takes me until 7 (I have a digestive/esophageal condition, so eating a decently good sized meal takes me a while). I do the dishes and clean up after dinner until 730. I shower up from work, that takes me until at least 8, if now 830 if I’m shaving (my head bald too - my hair grows in all patchy and messed up) and tweezing the brows so I don’t have a gigantic mustache on my forehead and trimming the nails and all that - about every 3rd night I have to do all that everything grows like my nails and hair have Wolverine’s healing factor. I have about an hour to get ready for bed - which is typically what I need to deal with stuff related to my digestive issues and brush my teeth and get my CPAP set up for the night and all that. That’s it. It’s bed time. 

When am I supposed to do any of the things I’m passionate about? Have hobbies? Aren’t those an important aspect of life/not burning out/staying healthy too? What about socializing? When am I supposed to spend quality time with my girlfriend? See my family? We don’t even have kids, or pets! How are people doing this?!?! I have to do this 6 days a week just to make ends meet, because the cost of living is so out of control. My job is ripping the life out of me but when am I supposed to apply for jobs?? At 11 o’clock at night?!? How in the hell is anyone watching television shows??? Staying politically informed - seemingly more important now than ever. What in the hell, man. This is unsustainable. My only day off in so beat and destroyed all I can do is lay there a heap of aches and pains staring at the wall buffering and it isn’t anywhere near the 100 years in a row of that I’d have to do to *start* to heal.

so this machine was practically never used by the previous owners who i assume bought it in 2021. it is unfortunately missing a portafilter and drip tray though :( i know gaggia sells a portafilter on their website, and the price is what i’m pretty much willing to spend on one. as far as the drip tray goes, would it be worth it to get an extended drip tray, and has anyone bought one that fit and works great? and do i still need the og drip tray for it to work as intended? 

gaggia also has cleaning supplies on their website which is great, as the previous owners kept it in their garage for a while and it’s pretty dusty. i’ll give it a really good scrub on the exterior regardless lol. any other recommendations for bar cleanliness? i know commercial machines have to stay super clean, but the food industry has made me a neat freak regardless. 

finally, any suggestions for bar smallwares on a budget? this machine has a cute design and as much as i want style to be a priority, i’m really just wanting to pull a decent shot for a cheap-ish price. if there’s a solid grinder out there under $100 i’d be thrilled. basics off of amazon are truly my speed. even better are suggestions for places to look for pre-owned supplies or things commonly found at the thrift store, as i’m trying to reduce my need for consumerism as much as possible these days! :)

testimonies and advice are so so incredibly appreciated. there’s really only one way to dip your toe into having a legit home coffee bar, and it’s by asking questions and admitting your lack of knowledge LOL :’) thank you very much for reading!!

It wasn't a jeweler's pristine counter, but a controlled chaos of specialized tools, tiny labeled baggies, and the gleaming detritus of deconstructed timepieces. Today’s patient, a popular ""VSF"" replica of a coveted diver's watch, lay partially disassembled in a velvet-lined tray, its case a hollow stainless-steel O

https://preview.redd.it/golhyhhf9u0f1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fdbc692d7d01bf554c5c0a3ceb880e78fc4d3035

Alex’s day rarely started with a jolt. It was more of a gentle immersion, like a diver descending into the quiet depths. Coffee, black and strong, was the first ritual. The second was reviewing the order notes and the mental blueprint for the day's main project: transforming this already impressive replica into something that could fool a discerning eye, or at least bring immense satisfaction to its future owner. This particular commission was a ""franken"" build – a high-quality replica base generously augmented with genuine and top-tier aftermarket parts.

https://preview.redd.it/szhw07og9u0f1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a175cf2a9cfdc31984f67a05efaa2e73d21eece5

His morning was a dance of microscopic precision. First, the dial. He’d sourced a rare ""gen-spec"" aftermarket dial from a clandestine supplier in Asia after weeks of searching forums and WeChat groups. Its sunburst blue was a shade deeper, the indices sharper, the luminous plots perfectly formed unlike the slightly puffier ones on the stock replica dial. Using a hand-setting tool and a powerful loupe clamped to his eye, Alex carefully maneuvered the new dial onto the ETA-clone movement he’d serviced and regulated the day before. His breath was a slow, controlled mist, his hands steady despite the caffeine. One slip, one errant twitch, could mean a microscopic scratch, a disaster at this scale.

https://preview.redd.it/p6898y72au0f1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1582dc539009995ca221e01d143d796f4653a4d6

Next came the hands. Genuine hands, procured at a significant cost, were a non-negotiable for this client. They had the correct sheen, the precise length, the perfect beveling. Setting them – hour, minute, then the delicate sweep of the seconds hand – was an exercise in Zen. Aligning them perfectly at the 12 o'clock position, ensuring clearance, feeling for the subtle click as they seated correctly on their pinions, was a moment of quiet triumph.

The digital hum of the ultrasonic cleaner provided a background score as he meticulously cleaned the replica case and bracelet, removing any factory oils or microscopic debris. He then inspected the rehaut engraving – the branded etching on the inner ring between the dial and crystal. On this particular VSF, it was already very good, but he’d once spent an entire afternoon painstakingly re-aligning a misprinted one on a lesser base model, a task involving custom jigs and a near-saintly patience.

https://preview.redd.it/v3pr26obau0f1.jpg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ab6df0506ef05077d867f82bf826c7270aabb701

Lunch was a quick affair, eaten while scrolling through RWI and other forums, checking messages from clients, and hunting for a specific vintage-style bezel insert for another project. The community was his lifeline – for parts, for troubleshooting, for a shared understanding of this niche obsession. He saw a new post from a fellow modder showcasing a freshly waterproofed ""Noob"" factory Submariner, complete with pressure test results, and made a mental note to congratulate him later.

https://preview.redd.it/pn64ekafau0f1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f612918aeb75ef3d01dc39c8cbaca2819b39367e

The afternoon was dedicated to the crystal and bezel assembly. The client wanted a ""Prof"" aftermarket crystal, renowned for its ""black hole"" effect on the cyclops date magnifier and superior anti-reflective coating. Using a specialized crystal press, Alex carefully seated it into the case, ensuring an even fit. Then came the bezel. He’d re-brushed the replica’s bezel assembly to give it a more genuine satin finish, a subtle but crucial detail. Snapping the new ceramic bezel insert into place required just the right amount of pressure. Too little, and it would be loose; too much, and the fragile ceramic could crack. The satisfying *click* as it seated perfectly was music to his ears.

https://preview.redd.it/5t7ro0fkau0f1.jpg?width=989&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ba472f0ef2856f9c7970d9d52d93213252c4748e

As dusk began to settle, casting long shadows across his bench, Alex performed the final assembly. The movement, now adorned with its new dial and hands, was carefully cased. He lubricated the gaskets with silicone grease, screwed down the case back with a specialized opener, ensuring it was tight enough for water resistance but not so tight as to strip the threads – a common pitfall with replica cases. He wound the watch, the smooth action of the crown a good sign.

https://preview.redd.it/4kae8y9lau0f1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=80d6a2c0508d7e7418d02aaf6de67577d3289177

The final hour was for quality control. He examined every angle under the loupe: the alignment of the bezel pip with the 12 o'clock marker, the infinitesimal gap between the end links and the case, the dust-free clarity of the crystal. He placed it on his timegrapher, watching the digital lines that translated the movement's health into readable metrics. A healthy beat rate, low amplitude error – good.

He strapped the finished piece to his own wrist, feeling the cool weight of the steel. It wasn't just a replica anymore. It was *his* work, a testament to countless hours of research, sourcing, and painstaking skill. Tomorrow, it would be shipped to an eager client, another ghost in the machine, a whisper of luxury made tangible through the alchemist's touch. As Alex cleaned his tools and powered down his bench light, he felt a quiet satisfaction. In his small workshop, amidst the scent of metal and oil, he wasn’t just assembling parts; he was chasing perfection, one meticulous modification at a time.",2,1747268717.0,replicawatchreview,0,1.0,False

Depression is opening your eyes in the morning and realizing that it's another day in which nothing will change.

Depression is knowing nobody can save you but yourself but that you are failing at that like you have failed at everything else.

Depression is the weight of expectation growing heavier by the day, the things you expect from yourself, the things others expect from you. None of which you will meet because it's too hard to motivate yourself to get a cup of coffee, nevermind a job.

Depression is the realization that it has been this way for ever, and will be this way forever because the cold hard truth is the depression is comfortable, and you are content drowning in it.

Depression is being numb when you want it to hurt, and hurting when you need it to be numb.

Depression is wanting to end it all but not being able to, not because you are scared, but because of how it will affect those that love you.

Depression is the nightmares that keep you tired and sleep deprived, and the flashbacks that hit you in the face even when you manage to get some rest.

Depression is bigger than you are, and seemingly smaller than those around you who never struggle with it, and can't understand why you can't just get over it.

Depression is praying for salvation, then praying for death so it's not your fault and they can't be angry at you. Eventually it's not praying at all because neither prayer is answered.

Depression robs you of your mind,your hope, your sanity, your motivation, and your soul, but in some sick twisted way doesn't rob you of love and guilt, which means you really are stuck.

Depression takes and takes and takes until all that is left is a barely functioning meatsack that once aspired to be more.

But then we both exit the building through the same door. Still not weird. I start walking toward the coffee shop, because I needed a sugar boost before going to the plaza. I notice he’s still behind me. Again—whatever. UCSD is big, but it’s not that big.

Then I get in line at Tims and this guy lines up right behind me. He seems kind of anxious? I look back once or twice just to make sure he’s not someone I recognize or had a class with, but he avoids eye contact. I grab a cookie and dip.

Thought that was the end of it.

Except I go to the bathroom—normal stop—and when I come out, he’s there. In the same area. Still not saying anything. And then… we both start heading toward the exit. Same direction. Again.

Okay, now I’m alert. I don’t think I’m being followed, but like… how many coincidences make a pattern? So I slow down a bit, hoping maybe he’ll pass me or take a different turn. Nope.

We both end up heading toward the station. He slows down now—great, now we’re both doing this awkward back-and-forth speed thing like we’re shadowboxing each other in public. I keep walking toward plaza, trying not to look over my shoulder every five seconds.

**\- Oliver -**

Oliver was still stunned by the match's outcome in arena 12 when Katherine abruptly entered the dormitory. The door slid open with a mechanical hiss, and she crossed the threshold with heavy steps, her face contorted in anger. Without saying a word, she threw herself onto one of the beds, her eyes fixed on the ceiling.

Oliver and Isabela exchanged uncertain glances. A heavy silence remained between them. He wanted to ask about what had happened at the end of the match or the fate of the recruit who had just killed an NEA officer. But Katherine's furious glare made him hesitate; perhaps it was better to wait until her anger subsided.

Minutes passed, and the tension in the air began to dissipate. Finally, Isabela broke the silence. ""Kath, what happened in there?""

""That piece of trash had to show up right now,"" Katherine blurted out, her voice laden with bitterness.

Oliver's eyes widened. Katherine rarely used insults or swear words, so her inclusion of them was quite impactful.

""Well, I think I know who you're calling a piece of trash. But could you give us more detail?"" Isabela gently pressed.

Oliver leaned forward, curiosity evident in his gaze. Katherine sighed before responding. ""It's Mordred; he's the Lots' main heir and a real son of a bitch.""

""And a murderer,"" Oliver commented.

Katherine looked at Oliver with a puzzled expression.

""What do you mean, murderer?"" Katherine asked.

""You haven't seen the replay yet?"" Isabela asked, surprised.

""Not yet; I came straight to the dormitory,"" Katherine explained.

""You need to see this,"" Oliver said, activating the hologram on his gauntlet. The floating image illuminated the room, revealing Mordred's battle against the Mini-Mechas and culminating with him splitting a Mecha in half with a devastating blow.

Katherine's expression rapidly shifted between surprise and disgust as she watched each part of the fight.

After finishing the replay, she sighed and sat on her bed. Oliver could tell from her expression that Katherine was thinking.

""What do you think will happen to him?"" Oliver asked, curious if there would be any punishment.

""I don't know. They probably won't expel him; maybe they'll hinder him a bit, but not enough,"" Katherine explained. ""He's powerful; the Lots have been preparing for this upcoming Emperor's election ever since Maximus took over. There's not a family they haven't tried to forge ties with.""

As soon as Katherine finished explaining, Oliver noticed that several recruits in the dormitory were trying to eavesdrop on their conversation. It made sense—many had watched the battle and learned that Katherine was, in fact, a princess.

""I think the first floor might be quieter at this hour,"" Oliver suggested to the girls, nodding slightly and pointing toward the other recruits.

""Sure. I need to have my afternoon coffee,"" Isabela spoke loudly so everyone could hear.

The trio descended the sleek, metallic staircase, heading straight for the dining area where a few cafes remained open. Since the entrance exams were still underway, few recruits were around. Those who were seemed more concerned with finding equipment or weapons to purchase.

Oliver found a table tucked away from the entrance while the two girls went to the counter to place their orders. They returned carrying two tall cups of some kind of coffee. Oliver couldn't quite make out the flavors, but there was far too much glitter swirling inside the cups for it to be regular coffee.

  
A case of content theft: this narrative is not rightfully on Amazon; if you spot it, report the violation.  

""Alright, you were talking about Mordred. Why did he approach you?"" Isabela asked, her curiosity evident in her voice.

""It's complicated,"" Katherine sighed. ""He was pressuring to collect on a promise between the Yorks and the Lots."" She paused, choosing her words carefully. ""I mentioned that his House wants to secure the Emperor's seat. To do that, they need the majority of votes from both Houses and Great Houses. Naturally, a Great House usually has several Houses under their protection, ensuring even more votes.""

""But what does that have to do with you? Isn't your brother the leader of your Great House?"" Isabela questioned.

""Yes, but... the promise was made long before he became the leader."" Katherine hesitated, her gaze distant. ""When our parents were still alive, they made a promise with the Lots that I would be betrothed to their son, securing our House's support for the upcoming election.""

Oliver raised his eyebrows, surprised. ""But are you going to marry him?"" he asked.

""Of course not! That promise was made by them, not by John,"" Katherine replied firmly. ""Besides, we still don't know what they received in exchange for such an agreement. However, Mordred is using this to put pressure on our family. He either wants official and public support—making the Houses of Mars vote for him—or he wants me actually to marry him, achieving basically the same result.""

They sat in pensive silence for a moment until Oliver had an idea. ""Couldn't you do the opposite? If he keeps pressuring you, why not support one of his opponents?"" he suggested.

""Yes, but unfortunately, we don't have close relations with the other Great Houses that are running. We'd just end up with a new target on our backs, especially during a Wave, which is the last thing we need,"" Katherine explained.

""What do you mean, during a Wave?"" Isabela asked, her brow furrowed in confusion.

""Every Great House is obliged to offer at least a thousand Rangers during a Wave. Perhaps you've noticed, but the main battlefront is occurring at Olympus this time,"" Katherine noted.

Oliver and Isabela nodded. Oliver recalled his conversation with Nico before he departed to assist House Dardanus.

""We have sent millions of soldiers, tens of thousands of officers, and thousands of Rangers leading endless campaigns in Olympus. Now imagine that at some point, an 'accident' happens. For some reason, support from the Lots' Rangers doesn't arrive, or the supplies they're supposed to deliver get lost,"" Katherine elaborated. ""Not enough to compromise the campaign entirely, but enough to weaken a House for a decade.""

Isabela nodded, grasping the gravity of the situation, while Oliver's face twisted as he absorbed the harsh reality. He thought silently, hoping for Nico's safety. ‘I hope the Dardanus don't have enemies.’

""But couldn't you do the same?"" Isabela asked, breaking the silence with a hint of challenge in her voice.

""John would never put other people at risk just to harm another House,"" Katherine replied firmly. ""Besides, their military power could overpower us. We'd have to be careful not to turn this into an even bigger conflict once the Wave ends.""

Oliver's mind seemed to be boiling, trying to keep up with the political chess game the Houses were playing. They were obliged to ally during the Waves but competed fiercely against each other as soon as the attacks ceased.

He also remembered Nico's words about doing what was necessary. If the necessary meant putting others at risk to ensure safety or the 'greater good,' would he be able to do that? Oliver didn't come up with an answer, but it lingered in his mind for a moment.

While he was lost in thought, the scene of Mordred splitting a mecha in half reappeared on his gauntlet's hologram. ""How is he so strong? Is it normal for someone to split a mecha in half?"" Oliver asked.

""No, not at all,"" Katherine admitted, crossing her arms. ""Control Boons are extremely powerful. But even so, it's impressive.""

""Control Boons?"" Oliver inquired.

""Yes, powers to control something, usually elements. Because they are purer, they tend to consume little Energy, allowing you to apply much more power. In his case, controlling shadows—or like John, who controls electricity,"" she explained.

""But even so, he's our age. There's no way he already has the power of a Ranger or, worse, superior to several Rangers. If he had only damaged the Jelly Bean to the point of stopping it from functioning, it would already be impressive,"" Isabela argued incredulously.

""Certainly, he was using something. The Castors are close allies of theirs and are always developing new drugs and experiments to enhance power,"" Katherine commented while watching the hologram again.

_Castor, Castor..._ Oliver repeated mentally until he remembered it was Kyle's House. Taking advantage of a moment when the camera partially captured Mordred's face, he used his hands to zoom in on the image. He could see that Mordred's irises were red, the same color he had seen in Kyle.

_‘Was he using that same drug? But there was no mask…’_ Oliver pondered, immersed in speculation.

""Even so, with or without the Castors, he has always been a genius. It's no wonder he's the heir, even though he's not the firstborn,"" Katherine concluded.

""But—"" Isabela began a question but didn't finish. The girl raised her arm, looking at her gauntlet. ""It's my turn.""

By Hariëtte Mingoen & Soehirman Patmo


On December 19, 2022, Prime Minister Mark Rutte, on behalf of the Dutch government, offered an apology for the Netherlands' history of slavery. He called it “a black page in the history of the kingdom.” These apologies were generally well-received in the Netherlands, Suriname, and the former Dutch Antilles. International media such as CNN, The New York Times, The Guardian, Jakarta Post, Tempo Indonesia, Channel News Asia Singapore, Reuters, and Africa News Ghana also covered it, although the latter did so five days later.



Rutte stated:
“You cannot ignore the historical facts. Until 1814, more than 600,000 enslaved African women, men, and children were shipped under appalling conditions to the American continent by Dutch slave traders. Most went to Suriname, but also to Curaçao, Sint Eustatius, and other places. They were torn from their families, dehumanized, transported and treated like cattle. Often under the government authority of the West India Company. In Asia, between 660,000 and over 1 million people—exact numbers unknown—were traded within areas controlled by the Dutch East India Company. The numbers are unimaginable. The human suffering behind them is even more so.”



East and West



Although Rutte explicitly mentioned slavery in the East in his speech, the broader discourse about Dutch slavery remains centered on the West. This is despite the fact that slavery in the East was much more extensive, lasted longer, and was equally brutal. Reggie Baay demonstrated this in his 2015 publication Daar werd wat gruwelijks verricht about slavery in the Dutch East Indies.



The Dutch West India Company (WIC) was founded on June 3, 1621, while the Netherlands was still at war with Spain. Because Portugal was allied with Spain, the Dutch seized parts of northern Brazil from the Portuguese in 1630. In 1637, they also captured Fort Elmina on the Gold Coast (modern Ghana), and by 1641, had slave posts in Angola. The WIC became the largest slave trader, holding a monopoly on the transatlantic slave trade until 1734.



In the East, slavery began with the war for monopoly over the spice trade in the Banda Islands (modern Indonesia), waged by the Dutch East India Company (VOC) against the English and Portuguese. Founded on March 20, 1602, the VOC was the world’s largest trading company at the time. Besides trade, its mission included establishing a network of overseas trading posts, supported by its own warships.


Massacre

Under Jan Pieterszoon Coen’s leadership, the VOC prohibited the Banda islanders from trading with the English and Portuguese, who offered better prices. When the population resisted, Coen, then Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, launched a punitive expedition. The VOC troops committed a horrific massacre—over 15,000 were killed, and about 800 survivors, mostly women and children, were enslaved. Coen earned the nickname ""the Butcher of Banda."" This genocide took place in 1621, making slavery in the East a reality long before that in the West. Slavery in the East was abolished in 1860, three years earlier than in the West (1863), though the enslaved in the West were still forced to work under state supervision for another 10 years.



Cultivation System

Over two centuries, the VOC experienced more good times than bad, but poor governance led to its dissolution in 1798, with all assets and debts taken over by the Dutch state. The English took control of the Dutch East Indies in 1811, appointing Stamford Raffles as Lieutenant Governor. British rule lasted until 1816. The prevailing colonial philosophy was to profit from colonies rather than spend on them, leading to the implementation of the Cultivation System, replacing Raffles’ Land Rent System, which was not profitable enough.



The Cultivation System assumed all land belonged to the Dutch colonial government, allowing it to demand rent from local populations. Governor-General Johannes van den Bosch was tasked with implementing it in 1829. His philosophy was clear: the colony had to be a source of profit. The Dutch Trading Company (NHM, now ABN AMRO) played a key role. Founded in 1824 by King William I, who was its largest shareholder, the NHM saw immediate gains—by 1831, a net profit of 200,000 guilders had been sent to the Dutch treasury.



Under the Cultivation System, locals were required to use one-fifth of their land (if suitable) for cultivating export crops like indigo, tea, sugar, tobacco, and especially coffee. These were traded in Europe by the NHM. The system lasted from 1830 to 1870, but for high-value crops like coffee, it extended into the early 20th century. Often, more than 20% of land was taken, and the most fertile areas were used. If people had no suitable land, they had to perform 66 days of unpaid labor annually—known as herendiensten—for the colonial government. In essence, slavery.



Famine

The system was widely abused. Native rulers received bonuses (called cultuurprocenten) based on yield, which led to extreme exploitation by both local rulers and corrupt Dutch officials. As described in Multatuli’s Max Havelaar (1860), by 1850 Java was hit by famine due to the Cultivation System. People couldn’t grow enough food for themselves, and the cash crops were purchased far below market price, then exported at high profit. Even in regions without famine, malnutrition and poor working conditions caused deaths. At its peak in 1840, more than 1.1 million Javanese—20% of Java’s 5 million population—were subjected to this system, effectively working under slavery conditions (as shown in The Demographic Effects of Colonialism: Forced Labor and Mortality in Java 1834–1879, WUR/Utrecht University, 2021).



Profits from the Cultivation System

The profits were enormous, and grew as the system became more efficient. Conservative estimates show that by 1850, the net profit (called batig slot) going directly to the Dutch treasury made up nearly 4% of GDP and over 50% of total state revenue (De Zwart et al., 2021). Even after its official end in 1870, remittances to the treasury continued until 1877, totaling 863 million guilders.



These profits funded, among other things, the construction of the Dutch railway network (from 1839), paid off national debt, and financed compensation to plantation owners during the abolition of slavery in the Dutch West Indies (P. Emmer; M. van Rossum, De Volkskrant, 2022).



Abolition of Slavery

Three countries abolished slavery before the Netherlands: Denmark (1803), England (1834), and France (1848). Planters in Suriname and the Antilles refused to cooperate without compensation. In contrast to revolutions (e.g., Haiti) or civil wars (e.g., the U.S.), the Netherlands required legislation—a slow process hindered by politicians with personal and financial stakes in Surinamese plantations. Additionally, the country faced a financial crisis, nearly bankrupt in 1844. Only through a loan and revenues from the East Indies did the 1846 budget balance.



Compensating plantation owners cost the government 12 million guilders. They initially demanded 400 guilders per freed person, but received 300 in Suriname, 250 in Aruba, Curaçao, and Bonaire, 200 in Saba, and 150 in Sint Maarten. This 12 million was a relatively small amount from the batig slot profits—but came at great cost to the Javanese, including death and suffering.



It is difficult to trace whether the Javanese contract laborers brought to Suriname were descendants of Eastern slavery victims. However, it is likely many were descended from those exploited under the Cultivation System. Driven by poverty, they were recruited by agents for private companies investing in the East Indies and Suriname after the system ended.



Slavery, the Cultivation System, and contract labor were all mechanisms of Dutch colonialism designed to force free or cheap labor under inhumane conditions. There is no “exclusive right” to claim more suffering than another. A better shared future is only possible if the colonial past is acknowledged and accepted—without prioritizing one group’s interests over others.

I’ve just been approved for a mortgage, which honestly shocked me. I haven’t been super strict with spending (coffee, eating out, general lifestyle stuff), so I thought I’d get turned down.

There’s a house I really like, but now that I’ve sat down and crunched the numbers, I’m seriously hesitating.

**Here’s what’s making me unsure:**

* **Rates and insurance alone** would cost me only **\$25/week less than my current rent**
* That’s *before* any mortgage repayments
* Over the first year, I’d be spending around **\$37,000 just on interest, rates, and insurance** — basically money I don’t “get back”
* My rent is around **\$11,000/year**, so that’s a **\$26,000 difference** in annual costs
* If I sold the house in 4 years, I’d have spent **over \$100,000 more than renting** in that time
* Sure, property values *might* go up, but I really don’t want to rely on that — it’s not guaranteed

I always thought buying a house was just the thing you’re supposed to do — the default “next step.” But I’m not planning on having kids, and now I’m wondering if I’ve just never really considered any alternatives. Maybe owning a house isn’t the only path?

I keep thinking: that \$26k a year could be saved or spent on other things. Maybe I should just wait longer, build up a bigger deposit, and try again when the numbers feel more comfortable.

**Has anyone else been in this kind of situation?**
Did you go ahead anyway or decide to wait? Would love to hear your experiences or advice.

I (30M) dated my ex (36F) for around 9 months. Early on, she told me she was polyamorous—about two months in. That surprised me, but I really tried my best to make things work because I cared about her. She’s incredibly independent, smart, and has gone through a major transformation herself. Before we met, she had lost a lot of weight and had skin surgery. She helped inspire my own journey—I’ve since lost a lot of weight myself and tackled serious health issues like diabetes and a heart condition.

After we broke up, I didn’t take it well at first. I sent messages I shouldn’t have, especially while dealing with health scares and feeling vulnerable. She ended up blocking me on Facebook and later on my main phone number after I overshared. That was over a year ago. I’ve worked hard since then to respect her boundaries, grow up emotionally, and stop acting impulsively. It’s been a long road of reflection, therapy, and making peace with what happened.

Fast forward to recently—we had a calm, respectful chat when I ran into her while I was out. That gave me the courage to reach out again, this time from a second Instagram account (she hasn’t blocked that one). I made sure my message was calm, non-pushy, and respectful. I told her I’ve seen her a few times while working and had waited to message her until I was sure my thoughts were positive, not reactive. I mentioned that because of my health, I can’t go out and ""bump into her"" like she used to say she hoped we would—so I was offering a simple catch-up, like a coffee or walk, even if she brought a friend.

She replied the same day:

> ""I don't want to leave you on read, so I'll let you know that I need to think about it. Not a no. I just want to properly figure out how I feel about it over a few days. I've been trying to make less reactive decisions. I hope you understand. I'll get back to you with an answer soon.""

That was over a week ago. I haven’t reached out again. I’ve learned from the past and don’t want to pressure her. I’ve worked really hard to wait on thoughts rather than act on impulse. I’m proud of how far I’ve come.

But I’d be lying if I said the silence doesn’t get to me a bit. I’m not obsessing, I’m not reaching out again, and I don’t check her socials. But yeah, I still check occasionally for a reply, just like I would for anyone I was waiting on. I also understand now that silence *can* be an answer. And if that’s what this is, I’m okay with it.

Still, I’d like advice on how to move forward. I know I’ve changed. I know I’m not who I was a year ago. But part of me wonders if she’s testing me, waiting to see if I’ll slip back into my old ways. I won’t. But I also won’t chase.

Any advice? Especially from women—how would you feel in her position? Do you think she just forgot? Or is this a gentle letdown?

1kmu9rw,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/1kmu9rw/some_study_tips_for_everyone/,some study tips for everyone,"im not sure if its the sheer pressure of getting through university or the recent books ive read sitting in my subconscious, but ive become entirely evolved when it comes to studying. ive gone from a person who would barely study for 30 mins a day to now having 5-6hr study days that are productive and efficient because i use active recall and practice problems. i havent significantly (or at all really) implemented the stuff ive learnt from the recent books ive read but i thought id list them for you anyways, and ive described some of the study tips that have helped me:

1. Atomic Habits by James Clear

2. Cal Newports books on studying well.

  
ive also realised that cutting down sugary drinks during ur serious study sessions is a life saver and increases ur attention span by tenfold if u drink black coffee, plain tea or water instead.

  
also, breaks are very important, dont study for too long without little breaks. and when you take breaks, shift your focus to something entirely different from what you are studying, this refreshes your mind and prevents it from getting tired of the subject at hand.

when it comes to all nighters, i dont think theres anything wrong with some well spaced out all nighters across the academic year, as long as they arent the night before the exam. if you think youre going to need to pull an all nighter then plan it in advance, do the all nighter a few days before the exam to get a headstart rather than the night before because this reduces your chances of doing well, by a lot.

stop seeing studying as a chore, and keep your future goals in mind. Sometimes we give too much importance to WHY we are studying ( i have to make my parents proud, i have to get this degree, etcetcetc). If you lift these expectations for a second and tell urself ur studying just because u can, it can feel quite freeing and might even motivate you.

  
lastly, dont wait months to be motivated to study. getting good grades is more about discipline than motivation, do it tired, do it scared. just do it. 

remember to eat well and get enough sleep, and allow urself to relax, have a place u can go to away from the world of studying to give ur brain a well deserved break after weeks of studying.

you got this!!! dont doubt yourself!!

Or ""Izuku embraces Americana. Villains SUFFER!""","It started shortly after he returned to UA *during* his Work Study with Sir Nighteye. He came back jittery, with his movements erratic and thoughts elsewhere. Given a few days off to rest and clear his head, he instead used them to plan. After his second sleepless night of planning, and *third* day of dark bags under his eyes and a flurry of plans running through his mind, Momo stepped in and, being the kind person she is, offered to help him with *anything* he needed. Izuku thanked her, but waved away her concerns all the same.
It was only several hours later, when Midoriya sat quietly, but *definitely* not still, on a chair, with a truly *concerning* number of coffee cups, and a wild look in his already bloodshot eyes.

""Yaoyo- Yaomomo"" he corrected himself, remembering her recently announced desire to ""Be more approachable."" She likely believed herself the cause of her apparent isolation. Izuku couldn't disagree *stronger*, but that's not the point.

Looking at him, Momo's mind whirled and spun, creating, and just as quickly dismissing, possibilities. All those thoughts were brought to a screeching halt when the young man continued

""You can make guns, right?"" Izuku's voice was almost comically casual, as if he asked her about her neighbors, or the weather, but his eyes? She couldn't help but focus on them again. Pupils trembling, bloodshot and clouded, by fatigue or *madness,* Momo was frankly too scared to ask.

""I *am* able to produce firearms. Assuming I have the blueprints and lipids, I could make nearly anything, within reason. I doubt I could make, say, a Minigun or anything too complex. Conventional arms are easy. Once you understand how the systems and pieces interact, you can study and replicate it."" She took a breath, reminding herself that, in the best way possible, not everyone was as intelligent as her.

Izuku, either ignorant or uncaring of Momo's dilemma, smiled widely and, in a rare pushing of his general boundaries, put his hand on her shoulder and spoke. 

""That's fine. I don't need much."" His tone was calm, but his eagerness stilled showed through as he pulled out a notebook from...*somewhere*, Momo wasn't sure, and opened it. On the two pages were a series of surprisingly, and *concerningly*, detailed diagrams. Rifles, pistols, even an AA12 Shotgun, if Momo remembered correctly. 

Slowly, Momo looked up at Midoriya, who looked as calm as he *usually* would, and took a risk.

""If you don't mind me asking, Midoriya... Why do you need firearms?""

Izuku, for his part, seemed *entirely* unphased. He smiled softly and spoke, more lucid than she had seen in *days*.

""There's a little girl out there, going through *Hell*, and she's depending on *me* to save her. The man holding her could kill me with a *single* touch. I want to prevent that from happening. Are you willing to help me?""

Momo's mind was, uncharacteristically, made up quickly. She looked down at the notebook between them, studying one in drawing in particular, before her.hand begins to glow. The light grew brighter, and her expression more concentrated, until a Colt.45. Model 1911 sat in her hand. She made to pass it to Izuku, when he suddenly moved his hand away.

""Check it.""

""Come again?""

""Check it. Never hand someone a gun if you don't know whether or not it loaded. Pull back the slide.""

Doing so, after.a surprising amount of effort, she saw the distinct shine of freshly polished brass. She thumbed the magazine release, allowing said magazine to fall into her hand, before pullingnthe slide back completely, watching as the remaining round flipped into the air. In a blur of green lighting, Izuku caught the bullet, admiring the shining casing in the normally mundane light of her lamps. He took the magazine from her and replaced the bullet, before reloading the gun, which he had finally accepted. He racked the slide, and flipped on the safety, before placing the pistol down, muzzle towards the wall. Silently, he took her hands in his own.

""Thank you, Momo. Sincerely. Thank you""

He thanked her... As if he *needed* to.

-----‐----

Several days later, Izuku sat on his bed, a small table over his lap, and a young, *adorable* red-eyed child sitting across from him. On the table sat a truly *ancient* model of pistol, all dark wood and darker steel, and an oiled rag. Slowly, Izuku disassembled the pistol, cleaning each part with a meticulous eye. Across from him, Eri's young mind rolled with thoughts a child her age *shouldn't* have. Those thoughts were interrupted by the gentle hand of Her Hero on her shoulder. Looking up, she saw his eyes gleaming with the familiar, but still cherished, kindness and patience.

""Do you have any questions, Eri? I don't mind answering them.""

Taking a deep breath, she made up her mind.

""What's that in your hand?""

Izuku smiled, ejected.the magazine and emptied the chamber before setting the empty gun down between them.

""This is a Gun, Eri. One of the most powerful, and easily misused, tool in existence. It was made to make all people Equal, even if it can be easily used to prevent that. It all depends on who's *holding* it. It doesn't make hurting people possible, it just makes it easier.""",25,1747266708.0,BokunoheroFanfiction,8,1.0,False

Lar’ee stepped down from the kitchen to join him with a beer in each hand, for although they’d achieved a great deal since he first arrived, there was still plenty to sort out.

They were still talking in terms of rough sketches on paper that hadn’t moved on to a computer yet. That’s when things would get serious.

“I remembered while I was in there that I needed to check on a few things,” he hedged, then shored up the generalisation with a half-truth. “One in particular — Charlie recently inherited the shop she’s worked at for years, and I wanted to find out if she had any surveillance before taking you over there to see what she was used to. I don’t know if it’ll make a difference to your design, but you could at least get a feel for what she does.”

“And you didn’t want me to get arrested for breaking and entering, since that’s the only human explanation for us being there uninvited and without a key. How magnanimous of you,” Rory drawled as he accepted the beer.

Lar’ee placed the free hand over his heart and tipped his head, knowing his original objective for leaving was now thoroughly swept under the proverbial rug. The longer Robbie’s household stayed off Rory’s radar, the better.

Rory rolled his eyes and clambered to his feet. “Well, let’s go then.”

Lar’ee placed a hand on Rory’s shoulder, and the two walked forward, disappearing into the celestial realm after a single step.

“It’s a sweet set-up, for a mom-’n-pop shop,” Rory said a while later, having walked around each car inside the garage and poked through the tools on hand. “A lot of these tools are antiquated. You should add a complete overhaul of her toolkit if this is what she’s working with.”

“I think they’re her boss’ old tools. Hers have been moved off-site. Her boyfriend bought them for her recently, and he didn’t want them left here to be stolen.”

“Fair call.” The hybrid then turned to Lar’ee with his hands on his hips. “So, why am I doing this again?” he raised his hands and waved at the garage around them. “From the workload I’ve seen, this is all she needs right here. So why are you setting up a secondary site for her?”

Lar’ee churned over the pros and cons of revealing some of the household’s history. “Because she’s wearing an ankle bracelet that’s limiting her movement to her apartment building for basically the next year.”

“She’s a criminal?”

“Not in my eyes, or anyone else’s who matters. Well, maybe Daniel’s, since he’s surgically glued his ass to his precious laws.”

“Okay … colour me intrigued. What happened?”

“She shot a couple of guys who attacked her while she was getting into her truck after work. The same shitheads killed her boss in cold blood when he tried to stop them. They shot him dead right in front of her. Fortunately, that distraction gave her enough time to reach for the gun in her truck.”

“Fuck me!” Rory shook his head, then threw his hands in the air once more. “And that right there is a perfect example of why we don’t just let any yahoo carry a fuckin’ gun back home. That shit’s insane!”

“Pretty sure your police force is armed, too, asshole, so don’t get too sanctimonious.”

The shock on Rory’s face as he registered what Lar’ee said would’ve been priceless, had the situation not been so serious. “You’re kidding, right? The cops attacked her?”

*“Dirty* cops, and her brother was getting real close to proving it. So, they went after his little sister to send a message to him to back off.”

Rory ran a hand over the top of his head. “How’s she doing?” There was none of the swagger Rory usually wore.

“As well as can be expected. The gun she used was the problem here. It wasn’t licensed, which is a huge no-no in New York City, even if she did use it to save her life.

“Before she was arraigned, her brother got wind of the news that they were considering home detention, so he had her move in with him. And because the floor they are on is all owned by one person and there's no height restraint, she can move anywhere within the apartment building, rather than being stuck in her old one-bedroom apartment.”

“And you said Llyr’s this brother’s landlord? Since when did that arsehole gone into real estate?”

“That’s his story to tell, man. Feel free to look him up and find out. I’m sure if you ask nicely enough, he’ll be *exceedingly forthcoming* with his private business.” The sarcasm dripped off his tongue.

“Yeah, no thanks. I’d rather have fifty back-to-back root canals,” Rory jeered, placing a finger in his mouth and faking a gagging noise in the process. “Those cigars of his are fucking disgusting.”

Lar’ee numbed his face to keep from snickering at the irony. For once, Llyr’s prickly personality and filthy habits would be a blessing in disguise. “Yeah, well, he didn’t take kindly to a young girl getting attacked and then punished for what he considers self-defence either, so he’s agreed to convert four vacant apartments in the building into a garage so she can keep working. Once it’s up and running, I’ll shoot over and grab anything she needs from here.”

“Is that how Charlie met Collette? Through Llyr?”

“In a roundabout way, yeah. These are good people, Rory. Do me a favour and don’t treat them like shit, okay? I’d hate to have to teach you what a huge mistake that would be.”

“And how do *you* fit into this dynamic?” Rory asked instead of answering.

Lar’ee decided to humour him. “The brother had five roommates, all sharing the rent. The oldest of those roommates is a close friend of mine. We go back the better part of ten years, and I’ve spent a lot of nights at their place, watching TV and eating snacks. I got to know all of them, including Charlie. She’s a sweetheart, but don’t underestimate her aim when she’s pissed at you.”

Rory perked up. “Ooooh, that sounds like an interesting story right there…”

“One that I’m not about to tell you. The bottom line is, I want this for her as much as everyone else. She shouldn’t be crucified for defending herself from a pair of dirty, homicidal cops.”

“Yeah, that’s bullshit. Okay, I know I said I was doing this anyway, but now I’m invested. This girl’s gonna get the garage of her dreams, even if I have to realm-step the equipment in myself between races.”

“Her family are kinda fans of yours…”

“Naturally.”

“And to think I had to wonder whose ego commissioned that monstrosity out the front of your place,” Lar’ee said, rolling his eyes.

“Hey, leave my fountain alone. It’s cool.”

“Only in your head, kid.” Not wanting to fight beyond the initial swipe, Lar’ee looked around the garage. “Do you need to see anything else?”

“Not here, but I wouldn’t mind seeing where this new garage is going. Maybe meet this Charlie-chick and get her thoughts on making it personal.”

Lar’ee looked at his watch. “It’s still a bit early for the apartment. All things considered, it’ll probably be better to have you come across once most of them have left for the day. That’s if you want to get anything constructive done.”

“Yeah, that’s true. Don’t get me wrong, I love being fawned over by my adoring public as much as the next Nascerdios, but I’m gonna be under the gun bouncing between here and Europe over the next week.”

“Alright. Well, if you’re good to get yourself home, I’ll go back to the apartment, and when the coast is clear, I’ll bring you across. That work for you?”

“Totally.”

The men nodded briefly at each other, then vanished into the celestial realm in two different directions. The first step into the celestial realm kept them within line of sight. The next one was when they went their separate ways, with Lar’ee appearing in the hallway outside the apartment.

He let himself inside. “Morning, all,” he said, spotting Rubin sitting at the island while Robbie puttered around the kitchen.

“How’d the refit go?” Robbie asked, serving up two plates of diced raw meat that had been marinated with a blend of sauces and spices.

Despite having had his share of three pizzas, the aroma had Lar’ee breathing deeply as he slid into his seat, taking the chopsticks that Robbie held out to him. “I’ve gone over some basic ideas, but nothing’s set in stone until Charlie runs her eye over everything.”

Robbie’s brow creased in instant confusion. “Charlie? What’s she got to do with anything?”

“It’s her garage,” Lar’ee answered snarkily. “Why wouldn’t she—”

“Oh! No, I meant the clinic. Isn’t that where you said you were last night?”

Lar’ee closed his eyes and then scrunched up his whole face. “Sorry, it’s been a long night. The clinic’s all finished and ready to go. Skylar and Bianca came in towards the end and got all the medical stuff squared away.

“Once the triplets and I weren’t needed anymore, I shot over to Rory’s to remind him that he promised to do Charlie’s garage today. He said he’ll come, but he wants to wait until most people are gone. He’s got a race that he has to prep for, so he can’t stay long and doesn’t want to be distracted.”

“Do you need sleep?” Robbie asked, suddenly concerned.

Lar’ee blew a raspberry and shook his head, even as Rubin snickered behind his chopsticks. “Thanks, kiddo. I’m good.” To change the topic, he shifted to his pryde-mate. “How’s Mason?”

“Still sleeping off the sedative. Today’s going to be an interesting day from that side of things as well,” Rubin answered. He plucked up a piece of meat, then waved it in Lar’ee’s direction before popping it into his mouth. “If Kearns can’t handle what he’s talking about, one of our healers will step in.”

Lar’ee looked at Robbie as he ate. “Oh, I took those pizzas you made for me and shared them with Rory. He knows they were made by someone divine, so it’s up to you if you want him figuring out it’s you or not.”

“How would I get around it?”

Lar’ee lifted his chin towards Voila. “All our food for today’s in there, isn’t it?”

“Basically…” Robbie drawled cautiously.

“Then it’s easy. I maintain Takumi’s protégé prepped it, and we never let on that that protégé is you.”

“I’m not his protégé…”

“Only because you don’t need him. And yes, he has taken you under his wing.” —Lar’ee waved his chopsticks at Voila— “He left the Prydelands just to deliver that—trust me, it’s not just some parting gift. When he came to Earlafaol, he was running for his life with every expectation of being murdered. His mother’s pantheon wanted him erased, and only Chance and Emi’s quick intervention kept them ahead of the pack. The Prydelands became his safe place to cook, and he's never left it since—until now.”

“True that,” Rubin agreed, using his chopsticks to shovel the raw breakfast into his mouth.

“Anyway, you decide. You’re the only one that’s stopping Yitzak from shouting about your existence to the world.”

“You didn’t let me decide on Monday…”

Lar’ee didn’t appreciate the petulance in his tone. “The notice was too short, and I wasn’t about to force your hand like that. This time around, you have at least an hour before Rory turns up. Whatever you decide will be fine.”

“Won’t it be weird though? Me, of all people, living in Llyr’s apartment?” Robbie frowned. “I mean, you did tell Rory this was Llyr’s place, didn’t you?”

“Yeah. He would’ve seen it soon enough on the job specs.”

“So, if I come out as a hybrid, what possible reason would Llyr have for being my landlord and not Pop or Collette?”

That was a very good question, and without a fitting response, Lar’ee kept eating. “Ball’s in your court, buster. Whatever you decide, I’ll have your back.”

“Gee, thanks.”

Rubin’s eyes suddenly sliced to the hallway leading to Robbie’s side of the apartment. “Mason’s up.”

1kmu4ye,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiveparents/comments/1kmu4ye/i_want_to_back_to_college/,I want to back to college.,"Ever since I’ve been living on campus my relationship with my parents has soothed over a bit. I was actually starting to feel happy about coming back for summer and seeing them again.

Wrong! 

I keep forgetting just how harmful they are to me. Not even a week back for summer break and I’m already breaking down. The constant screaming, belittling, and manipulation is too much for me. I want to go back so bad. I hate being with my parents. I just want to spend a peaceful summer back in my hometown, with my friends without my parents constant abuse. 
My mom constantly questioning me and criticizing everything I do and getting pissed off when I don’t cook to her standards, or when I don’t cook FOR ONE DAY because its too much for me to be on my feet for hours at a time cleaning and cooking for her, my dad, and brother for dinner, and my dad for lunch. PLUS for myself. 
Then there’s my dad constantly nagging me to go to the gym because I’m too fat, saying he isn’t dependent on me but still bossing me around like a maid to make him food or give him something. He is extremely complicated and I can never rest for a few minutes without him calling out to me to do something he doesn’t want to do himself. (Ex. make him coffee.) I have to make this fucker coffee EVERY STUPID NIGHT.
Then theres the fact I want to work to make some money and get away from having to babysit my brother, because I know for a fact my mom is expecting me to take care of him, she loves to abuse my time and making me babysit with no payment. 
I am so sick and tired of being treated like a maid or free babysitter. I am so sick of feeling like I’m less than. I am so tired of the constant bossing around.
For god’s sake, I am their daughter, not their slave. 
I want to live away from them so fucking bad, but I don’t want to live in the town my college is in because of how different it is from my hometown, how far it is from my friends, and the fact its right next to a fairly dangerous town. Plus I don’t even have the money to afford anything.
I’m gonna have to endure this shit for another 3 years. I genuinely just want a way to make steady money and move the fuck out. If I didn’t have to continue college and just make good money I’d even do that.

1kmu053,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticWithADHD/comments/1kmu053/struggling_with_medication/,Struggling with Medication,"Hello,

Wondering if anyone else has trouble assessing how their medication is working or if it is?

I started with stimulant medication at the beginning of the year. I was a little nervous about it but my therapist and psyhciatrist seemed to be encouraging at least trying it and believed it might be helpful for me. Started on small adderall and worked up and switched from instant to extended. Last month swapped to Vyvanese to see if that does anything different. 

Maybe I am jus struggling with how to measure or tell that it is working. It's not like a visual injury where you can see it dissipate or pain that you can feel stop. While I understand it's not some magic pill that just suddenly fixes my life all at once, I did think it was going to be more noticeable? I would've heard from many that it's normally a question if it's kicking in because it's obvious when it's active and when it fades off. 

Maybe my tolerance is higher but still as the dose went up there were only small indications. I could tell the medication was hitting me as I was noticing side affects. Mostly around apetite, thirst, and fidgeting. I haven't noticed anything obvious in terms of executive function, or calming down and relaxing. I didn't suddenly get the voices in the head to be silent or the squirrels in the brain to go away. 

I once described at an appointment that I am constantly an overthinker/ruminator and I am overly calculated like I'm playing 4D chess and always on fight or flight mode. To me if anything these  medications so far mostly feel like a strong cup of coffee. My body is energized and jacked up which isn't bad necessarily. But I also feel very overstimulated or easily overstimulated too. I have felt better because I am overeating less but that seems indirect. 

I've also struggled with getting to bed at an early enough time but hard to say if that's due to stimulants several days a week or other life stuff.

Has anyone found a significant difference between different medications while trying? or found that non-stimulants have helped? ",2,1747265996.0,AutisticWithADHD,0,0.75,False

Other than stress and sunlight, there isn't much my rosacea seem to react to. I've been able to maintain my rosacea pretty well with azelaic acid and some basic skin care routine.

But since the middle of April I have been experiencing random flushing on my nose late in the evenings. Always around the same time. My cheeks were fine. At first I thought it was my evening coffee that is suddenly causing a flush. But it also happens if I had a coffee in the afternoon. I never had any issues with coffee before, nor milk and sugar. 

So I stopped drinking coffee for a while. No change. Then I decided to just try drinking milk to see if it's the dairy messing with me. Nope still late evening flushing. Then the other day I skipped milk and coffee all together. Still flushing. I was thinking about the bread I ate, but I haven't reacted to it earlier, so I'm not sure.

Since I have no clue what's triggering the flushing, is it okay to just let it run it's course? I'm very paranoid of permanent redness though, especially since it's the nose flushing. I'm just so confused and unsure what to do especially when I don't know what is triggering my rosacea to begin with.

What’s for sure going: ceiling light, shelves, coffee table

The fireplace is decorative and doesn’t work, and we currently don’t have any window coverings because we live rurally and don’t have any visible neighbors or roads, so don’t really need the privacy (although not opposed to adding some!)

I’d like to get a new light for the ceiling, the current one is too bright and is a bit too much for the space. 

I’m open to sourcing some new furniture and moving existing pieces around/repurposing in other rooms, but would love to hear others’ thoughts on how this space can be improved.

Also I will never ever ever ever paint the wood walls or ceiling. ",2,1747265818.0,DesignMyRoom,2,1.0,False

This community was super supportive (thank you again!), so I went ahead and wrote the book. And honestly—at least in my not-so-humble opinion—it turned out pretty decent.

The story was based on a very unlikely connection in the Naruto universe (no spoilers in the unlikely event that anyone still wants to check out)

However, as all of you know, fanfics can't be monetized. So I had to make the painful decision to completely rework the setting. I “Fifty Shades of Grey”-ed my own story—turned it into a Japanese-themed progression fantasy with LitRPG elements. Same core, new coat of paint.

If my writing has any merit, I'd love to eventually earn a little something from it—even if it’s just enough for a coffee or two.

Generally, you'd grind a lot finer for espresso then for filter. The change in grind size alone means the motor in the grinder has to work harder. And adding to that, since light roasts are generally denser and therefore structurally harder, might that be causing damage to the grinders motor over time? 

Im also using an entry level grinder (Baratza encore esp), which i assume doesn't have the strongest motor out there. 

Do you have any experiences with grinding light roast beans for espresso over a long period of time? Did you have problems with your grinder because of it? Or am i worrying about something that isn't really an actual issue? ",1,1747265627.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

1kmttso,https://www.reddit.com/r/Machupicchu/comments/1kmttso/getting_machu_picchu_tickets_without_booking/,Getting Machu Picchu Tickets Without Booking Ahead: A Step-by-Step Guide,"Just wanted to share our Machu Picchu experience hoping it will help people plan ahead and avoid some stress.
We arrived in Aguas Calientes on the 12th of May and visited Machu Picchu on the 14th.
We didn’t manage to book in advance, so here’s how it works if you’re buying tickets in person.

If you can, book tickets online before they sell out, which tends to happen around 3 months in advance (at least in the high season).
If, like us, you didn’t get them online in time, arrive in Aguas Calientes at least two days before your planned visit if possible. I had read a lot of posts saying how bad Aguas Calientes is and how there's nothing to do there. I think this isn't true. We stayed for two and a half days and had fun exploring all the little corners of the town, squares, walking along the river, eating tasty food from some of the many available restaurants and trying some amazing coffee shops in the higher part of town.

Generally speaking, you need to queue at the Ministry of Culture the day before you want to visit Machu Picchu to get a pre-ticket, then come back later in the day to buy the actual ticket. In busy periods, there can be a two-step process: after the pre-tickets for the following day sell out (usually in the late morning), the Ministry of Culture may begin handing out pre-pre-tickets. These let you queue again the next day to try to get actual tickets to visit Machu Picchu two days later. The pre-pre-tickets get called at 6:00 am to get a pre-ticket before the people standing in line. Unfortunately, there's no way to find out in advance whether pre-pre-tickets are being given out that day, which is another reason to get to Aguas Calientes two days ahead of your intended visit.

When we first arrived two days before our visit (around midday), they told us they had nothing left and that day there were no pre-pre-tickets being given out. The day before your visit, if you don't already have a pre-pre-ticket, you’ll need to queue early. We got there at 2:40 am and ended up being number 100 in line. Be aware: some people hold spots for their friends or family. It can be a bit soul destroying when you’ve been standing for hours and a group of six people casually rolls in at 5:59 am. Even though there were only around 30 people ahead of us when we arrived, we still ended up as number 100.

Bring something to sit on and to watch or read if you can, it's a long wait. Depending on your number, you’ll be asked to come back from 3:00 pm onwards to buy the actual ticket. They call out numbers quickly in Spanish using a megaphone. Make sure you familiarise yourself with Spanish numbers or you might miss your call. Numbers 1 to 150 will be asked to come back at 3:00 pm, 151 to 300 at 4:00 pm, and so on until 9:00 pm.

They let 150 people at a time into the ministry, where you'll sit in a long row of chairs and slowly shuffle forward as the line moves. When it’s your turn, make sure you have your passport, the pre-ticket and the exact amount in soles (different circuits will have a different price). Also note: Circuit 2A and 2B sell out first, so if that’s what you want, aim to be in the earliest group.

You will now need to buy a bus ticket to go to the Machu Picchu citadel. You can buy these either online or in person at the Aguas Calientes bus office. They cost $24 or approximately S90 for a return trip. I think it is best to queue for your bus one hour before your Machu Picchu entry time. The queues can be quite long and you may get stressed, but don't worry, they move quickly. We had at least 100 people before us and it took us exactly 30 minutes to board. The bus trip takes 30 minutes and you can enjoy amazing mountain views. The bus ride to the citadel is like being on a scenic rollercoaster without the screaming, unless you’re scared of heights.

You will be let into Machu Picchu up to 30 minutes after your admission time.

We also spent a long time reading about the differences between different circuits and admission times. We ended up going for 2A at 9:00 am. There's lots of information online about this, but I just thought I'd mention that there's basically no difference between 2A and 2B. There are only two small deviations and we ended up following one of the 2B deviations at the start, then continued on 2A. Guards will check that you go on the correct route but not if you stick to 2A or B, so you can go wherever you want.

Lastly, despite the stress of not having a ticket, the sleepless night spent queuing and the prolonged stay in Aguas Calientes, we'd do it all again. When you finally get there, you’ll forget about your aching feet, the altitude sickness and even the person who cut in line. Machu Picchu is simply amazing and truly a magical experience.",2,1747265482.0,Machupicchu,0,1.0,False
1kmtts5,https://chatgpt.com/share/682527bb-9540-8001-9ff4-a0a97d919c74,"ChatGPT o3 doing an imaginary 5-minute stand-up routine it took ten seconds for it to write, in the style of Louis CK, on the subject of mattress shopping in Manhattan","**Imaginary 5‑Minute Stand‑Up Set — “Mattress Hunting in Manhattan” (in the spirit—not the voice—of Louis CK)**

*(Spotlight up. Comic trudges to center stage, paper coffee cup in hand.)*

**0:00 – 0:30** You ever try to buy a mattress in downtown Manhattan? It’s like being lured into a padded cell by people who smile too much. I walk in and the salesman greets me like I’m the prodigal son who finally came back with the inheritance. “Welcome! Can I get you a bottled water?” Buddy, if you have to hydrate me before I lie down, what exactly is in these mattresses?

**0:30 – 1:15** They tell you there are *three levels of firmness*: soft, medium, and “New York lease.” The last one is so hard it comes with a complimentary chiropractor and a note that says, “Hey, at least you still live here.” And they always have some Scandinavian‑sounding brand: *SvenSnooze 9000.* Because if IKEA taught us anything, it’s that an umlaut can justify any price. “Oh, there are two dots over the O? Take my mortgage.”

**1:15 – 2:00** The salesman does this move where he pats the mattress like he’s burping a giant baby. “Feel that support?” I lie down fully clothed, shoes and coat on—because that’s how I sleep, obviously—and he stands there at hip level, watching me breathe. I’ve had less intimate medical exams. He asks, “How does that feel?” Sir, I’ve been here thirty‑four seconds. I’ve had relationships that lasted shorter than this, but at least we both knew how they felt.

**2:00 – 2:45** Then he whips out the *adjustable base* remote. The bed starts folding me like I’m a letter from Hogwarts. My feet shoot up, my head goes down, and for a second I’m looking at my own belt buckle like, “Huh, so that’s where the pizza went.” He says, “This is the zero‑gravity position—it takes the pressure off your spine.” You know what else takes pressure off my spine? Not paying four thousand dollars for somewhere to drool at 3 a.m.

**2:45 – 3:30** I ask about delivery. In Manhattan, delivery means: two guys show up in a truck the size of a roach motel, double‑park like it’s an art installation, and carry a California king up six flights of stairs built when Teddy Roosevelt still had baby teeth. They get to my door sweating battery acid and ask, “Where do you want it?” I panic and say, “In the kitchen, next to the fridge—maybe I’ll finally eat breakfast in bed.”

**3:30 – 4:15** And the old mattress? They’ll “remove” it for a fee. Basically they kidnap it and leave a ransom note: “If you ever want to see your box spring again, slip fifty under the doormat.” I tried dragging my old mattress down the sidewalk myself. You haven’t lived until you’ve wrestled a queen‑size through a revolving door while a tourist livestreams you on TikTok: “Look, kids, it’s Manhattan culture!”

**4:15 – 5:00** Finally I buy the thing because I’m exhausted from *trying* mattresses. That’s the business model: wear you out enough that anything horizontal feels like a cloud of angels. I hand over my credit card, and it groans like it’s being bent in half. The salesman says, “Great choice! Ten‑year warranty.” Ten years? Buddy, in ten years I’ll be sleeping in the Metaverse on a digital futon made of Bitcoin regrets. But sure, sign me up. *(Sips coffee, shrugs.)* Anyway, if you need me, I’ll be in my kitchen‑bed hybrid, eating cereal at midnight and praying the SvenSnooze doesn’t hit me with another subscription fee. Good night!

1kmtszo,https://i.redd.it/eejsgb461u0f1.jpeg,Am I overreacting or is a low Oura score an annoying excuse for cancelling a date?,"I live in SF and was dating this guy (36, AI founder) for about a month. He sent me this series of texts to call off our dinner date that evening and they ignited a debate among my friend group about whether it’s socially acceptable to let someone in on your biodata in this context, or if it feels unnecessary / like he’s way too deep in. 

For additional context, we slept together for the first time a week before and over the next few days, he seemed very fixated on his fatigue and told me that he got a sleep score of 59/100. I also felt hurt/put off by this behavior, because I consider the first night at someone’s apartment a guaranteed sleepless night (and well worth it). 

I ended things this past weekend in part due to the above, but mostly because he was breadcrumbing me/flaking on plans, super busy and stressed about his company, and let’s be honest - probably just not that into it. 

Tried to be understanding about the Oura stuff but I can’t help but wonder how this fixation with biodata is sustainable over time?

I used to have wpw (wolf Parkinson white) basically a heart problem and I had something called an ablation to fix my heart. It worked but since I found out about a year and a half ago my anxiety affects my heart cause when I get anxious my chest aches a bit and it makes me think is something wrong with my heart. Other than that here we go.

Today is my day 2 (well finished it's 11:30pm)
I would say I'm a healthy person not so healthy but not badly unhealthy just average. In perspective I weigh about 90kg in pounds thats about 200lbs, and Im 6'3 in cm that's about 192cm.

I'm worried I'm going to die on this medication I know it seems over exaggerating but I've been having worse anxiety since I started. I'm on fluoxetine so I think it's weakening the effects of it.

Normally my resting heart rate is about 70 to 75 and I can easily run up my stairs without getting tired but since starting my meds my heart rate resting is between 80 to 90 is this normal and before I used to be able to sprint up the stairs and my heart rate would be about 95 but when I do it now my heart rate goes to about 115 to 120.

And I've been drinking a LOT more water and I mean a lot. Reminder I am someone who will drink like 1 litre of water a day and the rest of my fluids come from coffee and teas, the last 2 days I have ended up drinking an estimated of nearly 4.5 litres on average and I mean like yesterday I drank 4 liters and today I drank 5 and whole writing this I'm still thirsty but the weird thing is I've only peed like 3 times today.

I know this is posted in Vyvanse but it says Vyvanse and Elvanse are basically the same and the Elvanse reddit group is very dead. I'm only on Elvanse 20mg right now.

Will my heart get used to the medication and my heart rate goes down over time or will it be like this forever cause I feel like I can't sleep cause I'm stressing over it.

Thanks for reading if you made it this far. I really need help and want to know if anyone relates to this.

1kmtou3,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoddessCafeTerrace/comments/1kmtou3/hayatos_daughter_doesnt_recognize_her_mother/,Hayato's daughter doesn't recognize her mother?,"The last episode left me thinking. Supposedly, none of the girls were able to see Hayato's daughter. I find it strange that the daughter didn't notice her young mother's face when she'd already seen it in a photo. It's also mysterious how each girl arrived at the coffee shop:

Hayato's grandmother feels alone and is crying, so Hayato's daughter feels bad for seeing her in that situation. Then she can see Shiragiku from the outside. It's safe to say she was the only one with genuine intentions of wanting to work at the coffee shop, but she decides to leave. Then she senses something (Hayato's daughter) stopping her, and she decides to go in at least to say hello and, in doing so, ask about the job.

Then Hayato's grandmother mentions that they need at least one more girl so Kiku doesn't get bored (I imagine Hayato's daughter heard that too). So she sees Akane looking at the waitress job offer. She thinks about it and finds it even funny because it doesn't fit her personality (she takes it as something stupid I'm thinking), but she senses something's holding her back, so she turns her face and decides to at least try. Of course, with a phrase that matches her personality and a relaxed or carefree look, the kind of look you get in anime: ""Well, if I get the job, great, and if I don't get it, that's fine too"" (since she didn't see herself working as a waitress).

Up to this point, all the waitress positions had already been filled. If we go back in the manga, this is also made clear. It means that no more waitresses were needed, but this is where the strange thing comes in.

Because Hayato's daughter stood at the front of the street right between two people who were almost about to fight. Although Ouka and Ami were looking for a part-time job, neither of them had noticed the job sign across the street. If only they hadn't sensed something was leading them to the family, you could say fate had called them to the coffee shop.

Here comes something that also seemed strange to me in the manga: Hayato's daughter realizes she was taking the girls to the coffee shop. I imagine she thought there were 5 girls in the photo and that's why she invites Riho in because one girl was missing, or she realizes she's depressed and invites her in since anyone who feels bad can go to the coffee shop to feel like part of a family. Or she noticed that of the 5 girls, only her mother is missing and that's why she invites her in. I say this partly because you could say it's the scene that conveys the most emotion, because Riho went to the coffee shop that very day when she was feeling very sad, as if it were also something of destiny.

Up to this point, as a conclusion for me, the daughter who already saw the photo of her mother when she was young and can't really recognize her could only be two people, Riho or Ouka. Since Ouka is dressed strangely, she also wears glasses that cover half her face, and her hair is of different colors. Or it could be Riho, who looks very different since her face looks sad. She also has a different hair color and hairstyle. I mean, if you compare the Riho of the past with the current Riho in the photo, there's a big difference.

Hayato's daughter, of the other girls, could have realized who her mother is. Shiragiku only has her hair cut short, but her face is fully visible. Ami wears her hair loose and long, but now wears it in a ponytail, but her face is also visible. Finally, Akane, the only thing that changed was her hair color, but her face is also visible (besides all the girls, she has a very different face and eyes that make her distinguishable at first glance).

I don't know if my analysis is correct or you interpret it differently, but I think Riho has a good chance of being the mother with this last chapter.",5,1747265095.0,GoddessCafeTerrace,2,1.0,False

I’m a Christian Arab and this Arab Muslim guy and I really like each other. We’ve been talking for about a month. He’s a nice guy. We both handle religion the same, we both talked about the logistics of a Muslim and a Christian being together. I understand his faith, he understands mine. We both can connect culturally as well which is nice. His family accepts the idea of me. 

The only issue is that he says since dating is haram, he wants to wait until marriage *and* he only wants dates like coffee dates or something up until marriage. He wants to marry within a year. 

The problem with that is…how am I supposed to get to know the *real* him if I’m just sitting having coffee with him and not seeing him how he acts in the world? It takes a while to get to know someone, and you can get to see who they really are faster when you spend actual time with him. Not just a 4 hr coffee date “ok let’s go home at 6 pm cause it’s haram if we stay out past 6. Staying out late can lead to sex.”

Everyone is nice at first, and I really need to know the guy before I decide I’m gonna marry him. I need to see how he is with others, what he says versus what he does etc. 

For example, a guy can say “oh I never wanna fight I hate fighting” but you can’t take that at face value cause no one likes fighting lol. You have to see what he’s like when he’s feeling low, etc. Before you marry.

I feel like all of this could be a huge dealbreaker for me because there’s a high risk level of marrying the wrong person. You can’t get to know someone at the level you need to with just coffee dates. What do I do? He doesn’t want to change his position.. ",4,1747264974.0,progressive_islam,15,0.75,False

Come be active with me and see where life takes us! I could spend a hour on here typing, but the only way you truly get to know a person is talking to them, and spending time with them getting to know them better.

Im very open to meeting new people and getting out and doing stuff, and by stuff I mean anything that gets me out of the box, and work especially on weekends.

I dont drink much, but Im open to going to a bar and having a beer and talking to you for awhile, and seeing were it goes! Jamming on some pool or anywhere that's fun! I enjoy shooting, the outdoors,fishing,swimming,bqing etc. and then some.

 Or even a coffee if you'd like that better Im not picky.

I don't want to make this very long, if your interested in meeting a successful down to earth man who's intention is genuine, you've met one.

Some of you may have seen a previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/LaMarzocco/comments/1il6c2c/has_science_aka_the_inability_to_leave_anything/) of mine where I shared Tate Mazer's Shot Stopper integration into my LMLM with a custom PCB, brew paddle cover, and the addition of buttons to increase and decrease brew target. I finally got around to making a PCB that has connectors for the increase and decrease buttons, as well as a connector to plug in a manual brew/flush pushbutton. I also had a PCB faceplate made for the 3D printed paddle cover. 

I know the purists will hate this, but I got this machine for dirt cheap, and can be returned to factory in about 10 minutes.

1kmtfs7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1kmtfs7/i_dont_know_what_to_do_help/,I don’t know what to do help,"Ok so I moved out of my Mexican home at 18 with my 28 year old undocumented boyfriend I literally had no where else to go
because my parents were kicking me out because they were influenced by my older sister who was/is a deadbeat. 

My sister would tell my parents that I was sleeping all day and did nothing for the household (she was just leaching off of them plus she was 20 years older than me so she was 38) I was bearly starting to work and my parents helped me get a used car and I paid it religiously so I didn’t ruin their credit. 

Ok so the day came where I had to move out I was sad leaving them because I knew my mom was influenced by my 38 year old sister. I honestly moved in with my boyfriend because I had no where else to go no other family or dad or anyone. 

I would take care of of his home cook clean work from 3 am to 12 pm every day sundays off.

When he would get home at 6-8 pm I would get up and cook for him from scratch Mexican food then clean the kitchen and go back to sleep a little bit longer. That was my life for years until it came time to fix his papers, I wanted a simple wedding and wedding dress because I knew he couldn’t afford much and he said that was a waste of money and that we should just go to the court and that’s it. 

Me being young and stupid I was like yea maybe he is right so I ignored my gut feeling about it and at that time I mended things with my mom but I couldn’t go back to the house because that sister was still there leaching off of them still. 

The day of the court marriage my mom told me are you sure you want to do this I told her honestly I have no choice he said he needed papers and I feel if I don’t give him papers he’ll leave me.

We got married and that same week he started the process to get his papers, he would tell me to just go sign with the lawyer 
 Anything he needs you to sign, honestly I didn’t even know what I was signing the lawyers assistant would just tell me sign here here here and here and see you next time. 

Honestly I was like well my maybe if I do this for him he will want to marry me in church and I’ll be worth marrying.
He would work weekends go hunting and once or twice a month we would go eat seafood because that’s what I liked. 

His phone was always locked, when he received calls he would walk away, I started getting insecure I let him know how I was feeling and he told me stop exaggerating and stop being Mensa meaning stupid in Spanish. 

So at night I would go cry in the garage because I was feeling jealous anxiety sadness loneliness more and more because he wouldn’t pay attention to me or want to go to the grocery or shopping with me.

Years went by we went on a trip to hike, we were in our hotel things got intimate, fast forward a few days later I had a fever I told him about it and he was like oh that’s just from you shaving and I was like no this is not from shaving I’m scared he was like it’s nothing!!!! So I went to the dr without telling him because I had things down in my private area and doc confirmed it was the big Herp. And I cried and told the dr maybe I sat down on a bathroom but he wouldn’t cheat de just looked at me with potty he asked how old is your partner I told him he’s 10 years older than me, he just looked down, and he gave me pills take these tell your partner and I went home I told him he was like oh that’s nothing in Mexico we call those fuegos it’s normal, I was like wtf I had always gotten tested every 6 months since 18 and now you say this is normal? You knew you had this? He was like yea, I cried because I knew no one was going to want me anymore because of this, in that moment I knew he had cheated and that now no one would want me and now I had to stay with him.

It was time for his residency meeting in Mexico he went first then I went second, he went to his meeting in Juarez and I waited outside once he came outside with his envelope that he couldn’t open at all until he got to the border he gave it to me smiling and saying in Spanish (ya no te necesito) I don’t need you anymore! and I froze with disbelief of what he had just said to me. I wanted to rip that envelope open and leave but I couldn’t because it was Juarez and he could just say I got kidnapped and disappear me or something. 

I stayed quiet I planned my next move I had 3 credit cards I used for my expenses, gas, dermatologist because I had cistic acne and I was going to the dr a lot because I wanted to get pregnant and he told me to put it on my credit cards and that he would pay it off later, me being dumb I said ok.

We came home we got into an argument I think it was about money because I told him I was in debt and if he could help me pay off the credit card for my fertility treatments, he was like why if I’m not the one wanting kids, I froze and I just thought wtf am I doing with a guy like this then I thought oh yea no one will want me anymore because I have the nasty H, then he said in Spanish I have enough money to have you and have another woman on the side. 

So then I thought well if he has enough money for me and another woman then he will spend on me only from now on.

I quit my job, went home and thought of what I was going to do because I felt used in all the sense of the word.

He came home I told him to please sit down, I told him you will pay the credit cards off and will help me with college and pay for my Dr visits and my personal expenses.

If you have enough money to have two women then you will spend all of that on me, I will not be struggling financially meanwhile you have what you wanted from me papers and the freedom to come and go as you please. He stayed quiet and agreed. 

Fast forward we kept our routine him working going “hunting “ on weekends and he wouldn’t take me out at all once a month I expressed I was feeling emotionally abandoned and that I needed some love and attention he ignored me and I begged and begged and begged for love as I still did everything in the home clean cook from scratch fold clothes, iron his work clothes everything I did even when I was working now I was studying. 

Nothing was ever good enough for him there was always something for him to complain about for example he would say oh you don’t put enough salt on the food, so I experimented and put clear tape on the salt shaker and I was like oh ok here is the salt shaker he would then look at me in the eyes and shake away and then take a bite and say mmmmmm yum see that’s how much salt to put on the food, so ever time I would serve him (the shaker had tape on it for months and months) and in front of him I would shake away like he did and he would be like mmmmm yes just how I like it perfect, there had been no change to the food because of the tape on the salt shaker until one day he noticed there was tape on it and he got so mad, he was like how long has this tape been on here I looked him straight in the eyes and said for years he got so mad he walked off without eating.

My dad got sick and was getting worse, he passed away and the very next day my husband got up early got dressed in his hunting clothes and was heading out the door when I woke up my eyes swollen from crying and I asked him where are you going he said hunting, I said can you stay with me? He was like for what to lay in bed all day? My heart broke in that moment and I felt I became heartless, I started crying and he left to go hunt. 

I went to my dad’s burial alone, I did everything alone, I went to family functions alone, but God forbid I didn’t want to go to his family functions because then he would yell and be like wow I can’t believe you don’t want to go mind you his family talked shit on me because I was born here and would make backhanded comments about women from the United States don’t know how to cook or clean, my house was spotless, I cooked from scratch, and their homes had roaches, dirty, flies everywhere cooked with canned Mexican food menudo. I would just stay quiet.

I started fishing and kayaking going by myself doing everything alone, one day I just had enough started selling all of my decorations pretty things I had at home and he noticed he was like why are you selling your things I said well you complain a lot about how the house is always dirty which was not true because I would clean all the time mop every week swiffer every day and wash a load every day.  And he was like no don’t I was like yea maybe that way the house will be clean finally. 

And honestly I was going to end myself that day he didn’t want kids with me, he had told me I wasn’t worth marrying through church, he had gave me the big Herp., he always had something bad to say about me or my figure, if I was losing weight oh why are you losing weight if I was gaining weight why was I gaining nothing was ever good enough.

The last things I had to sell were some candles this person named cash sent me a message we were going to meet up at a store I parked told the person I was there I honestly thought I was meeting with a female, when I tell you this guy walked up to me and I looked at him just his neck and down didn’t make eye contact with him for the first few seconds I was selling the candles for $10 4 nice teal candles. 
He seemed like he was trying to make eye contact and when I looked at him in the eyes it was like time stopped in that moment, I saw his hair I saw his face, his skin texture, his eyelashes, how tall he was and how amazing he looked then I felt like a bolt of electricity go through my body from my head to heart to toes and time was literally still. 

Then everything started moving again and he was handing me $20 I was like oh I asked only for $10 he was like oh take it it’s $20 I was like no it’s ok you can have them I was just thinking of ending myself, then he was like want to go shopping with me? I was like sure why not, then I felt like at peace talking with him like if I had known him my whole life and we were shopping and talking and laughing, honestly I thought he was gay because he was so clean and good looking, then the time went by so quickly we were shopping for 4 hours, then it was like 8 or 9 pm and I was like well it was nice meeting you, and he was like looking around he was like want to go eat ? I was like eh sure one last meal can’t hurt. Then I was like looking around and saw five guys restaurant and I was like how about five guys he was like oh wait I don’t know you like that I laughed I was like the restaurant five guys and pointed he laughed and was like ohhh five guys I thought you meant something else I laughed.

We ate talked and I felt so at ease with him he told me his life I told him mine, then it was time to go home and I was like well nice meeting you, he was like nice meeting you too, I left drove home and then received a message and he said it was nice talking to you I would like to get your number, I didn’t respond back right away, I went home husband was still not home house was empty from the pretty things I had only the couch’s and coffee table were there and dinning table from Amazon because he said I didn’t deserve to have a nice dining table. 

I waited for him my cat must have sensed I was done that night because she kept getting on my lap getting her paws on my cheeks and trying to have me stare into her eyes. From when my dad passed to the day I met this guy I had really bad panic attacks and that was another reason I wanted to end things with myself, my cat was the only one that was there for me she would lay on my chest when I had my attacks and purr until they passed.  My husband hated her he would always tell me he would skin her alive, I would tell him to not even think of touching her.

He came home and I told him I wanted to talk to him, he was like what do you want, I told him I’ve been feeling, neglected, depressed, my panic attacks are getting worse, and im not feeling loved, he was like what sighed and rolled his eyes and he was like this again, you keep telling me you feel alone and not loved you know how I am I’m not the man that will give you flowers or be loving towards you. What do you want just be happy I pay the rent and food that’s all you women need anyway you should be happy with that you don’t need anything else.

I just sat there he got up turned off the lights went to the room slammed the door and I just sat there in the living room in the dark processing everything and just telling myself yea I’m making a good decision ending myself tonight.

Then I got a message from the candle guy again saying I would like to see you tomorrow if that’s ok. 

Then I felt my heart flutter a little and my head was like let’s just wait until tomorrow 

Then I answered ok I would like that. 

I met with him we had coffee and I felt that electricity through my body again I had never felt that before and one thing led to another and I I had never experienced an orgasm pussy trembling, squirting, electricity from my head to my toes, I had never before in my entire life had an orgasm I felt amazing I felt like everything was going to be ok, the guy was like are you ok I was like yes this is my first time having an orgasm and he was like I can tell, then we did it two more times, after that I went home sat down on the couch and told myself I cheated, I started feeling like shit, I didn’t tell my husband, now one thing he didn’t know is that I used protection with this guy.

 And I slept with my husband because he wanted to I didn’t want to really anymore because he would just do his thing and finish. A week went by I started feeling sick headache discharge I was like what the hell, I went to the dr it was chlamydia, I sat there just in disbelief again. Thinking to myself really again? I asked if this could be transmitted through sitting on a toilet or anything else, he said no just sexual contact. I messaged the candle guy I let him know, he was like we used protection and I will go get tested, I told my husband he was like ok? Can’t you just take pills for that? My stomach sank and I was like it was him, he cheated or has been cheating. 

I went home told him I cheated thinking he would come clean and I told him the condom broke just to see if he would admit he had cheated too and no everything was blamed on me. I was the one that gave it to him I was the cheater the candle guy a week later shows me he was clean and I thanked him and went on my way.

And since then it’s been two years and my husband still blames me for infecting him with chlamydia when I know it wasn’t me. 

I know me cheating wasn’t right but financially I can’t on my own, no one will want me with the Herp.

The sun shone down on a bright day at the university. The sound of construction went on steadily off in the distance where the school was putting together some of the buildings CORVAC crushed on his rampage through the city. 

Luckily the university had a pretty hefty insurance policy in case of super powered disasters. Sure the feds bitched about rebuilding the city, again, but it’s not like they could just abandon an economic engine like Starlight City even if it was more disaster prone than other cities.

Amazingly enough, the insurance premiums still didn’t come close to some of the government subsidized stuff on the coastlines that were getting pounded by hurricanes like they were paying for it every summer.

As I always did when I heard the construction I thought back to CORVAC. I wondered about that megalomaniacal computer a lot these days. 

Sure he'd been a jerk, sure he'd been sarcastic, sure his last act had been to try and kill me, but there were still times I missed his sarcastic jabs. There were times I missed his unique ability to pull off a support role in a way my current AI just couldn’t.

That was the toss up with computers. On the one hand sapience made them really god at their jobs. On the other hand it made them a hell of a lot more likely to defy their meatsack masters.

At least I didn’t have to worry about him trying to take control of the world’s nuclear arsenals and use that to drive humanity to extinction. Partly because he’d watched the old *Terminator* movies and decided that method of world domination was too gauche, but mostly because it turns out the U.S. nuclear arsenal was run by a bunch of ancient computers that were air gapped via literal floppy disks that wouldn’t be able to fit any bit of CORVAC on them for infiltration.

Score one for legacy green screen technology. Like actual monochrome monitors that could only display green. Not the stuff they were using in movies.

“Thinking about him again?” Selena asked.

I turned and hit her with a smile. “Which one?”

“Your computer, of course,” she said, reaching a hand across the table and giving mine a squeeze. “It’s okay to miss him, even if he did betray you.”

“I guess,” I said, letting out a laugh that came out more as a sob. Which I immediately brought under control. “Who would’ve thought I’d actually miss that asshole?”

“I had a cat like that growing up,” she said, also looking off into the middle distance.

I blinked. “You had a cat who tried to take over the world via a giant death robot chassis?”

Selena snorted. “Nothing like that. He was an asshole who would bite the shit out of you if you gave him more than two pets, and he had a habit of shitting in the middle of the living room when anyone did something to displease him.”

Now it was my turn to snort. “Sounds like my kind of cat. I use them in my air vents to keep the mice out, you know.”

“You do?”

“Why do you sound surprised by that?”

“Oh I don’t know,” she said. “I guess I would’ve figured you’d use robots for pest control.”

“Cats are more cuddly,” I said with a shrug. “And I do have robots for scooping the litter boxes.”

“Still. It’s okay if you miss your computer. I know the two of you worked together a lot before he pulled his double cross.”

There were times I wondered if he was really gone. Somehow it seemed too easy that a simple EMP blast was enough to take him out.

Then again, he did have the hubris of a top class villain. I’d expect nothing less from a villain who sort of studied under me. I was the best after all.

That well-developed sense of villainous hubris meant both that it was entirely possible I'd actually defeated him with a glaring weakness, and that it was also easily possible such a glaring weakness would turn out to be not so glaring and he'd pop up at the worst possible moment sometime in the future.

That was how all the best villains did it, after all. I could say that with certainty because that’s how I did it. I’d faked my death at least twice to try and get somebody to come out of hiding so I could vaporize them.

But best not to think about that right now. I was trying to enjoy my lunch.

“Pity about the journalism building,” Selena said, looking over at the building that still had a massive hole in it.

Though it was getting fixed faster than some of the other buildings. Thanks to a generous anonymous donation. Well, semi-anonymous. The administration was still debating whether or not they should actually rename it the Night Terror School of Journalism.

Okay, so maybe it wasn’t all that anonymous at all.

I smiled as I looked at that building and remembered all the fun I’d had there. Selena ended up getting an A on the midterm exam, and it was an A I was more than happy to give her. Her paper on why heroes intervening in a supervillain's business caused more problems than it fixed had been amazing, bringing up points I hadn't even thought of. 

Of course she admitted to me that she didn't believe a word of it, but what mattered was she was able to expand her mind long enough to get the words on paper. And I’m not talking about the sort of mind expansion that the journalism majors I knew when I was in undergrad were always going on about.

“It’ll be back and better than ever soon enough,” I said. “Looking at that thing has me thinking about how we got together.""

“Those were good times,” she said with a faint smile on her face. “Even if there were a few times when I had to resist the urge to stop you from potentially killing someone.”

I resisted the urge to reach out and smack her, both because it would have looked odd to the students and professors sitting around us at the food court and because I knew it wouldn't do a damn bit of good anyways. If the best weapons I could come up with weren’t enough to hurt her in pitched combat then a little playful smack wasn’t going to do anything.

I did still have those toys Dr. Lana came up with, and I still refused to use them because Dr. Lana came up with them.

“So you suspected?”

“A little,” she said. “But I was more worried you weren’t… you.”

She paused a bit at the last one. She looked around. We were in a crowded outdoor dining area, and there was always a chance someone would overhear her.

“That was your worry?”

“Well yeah. You don’t hurt people. You go out of your way to avoid hurting people. If you were you then there was no danger. If you were some irresponsible prof whose ego was writing checks their students had to cash then the people in that class were in real danger.”

I grinned and reached out to pat Selena’s hand. She hit me with a dazzling smile that still blew me away.

“So when are you due back at the parts of the journalism building that are still open for business?” she asked.

Now there was the strangest turn of events in this whole damn thing. Sure it eventually came out that I was teaching the class without a lick of appropriate credentials, but at the same time everybody in my Journalism 105 class had survived CORVAC’s rampage through the university without a scratch despite a direct hit on the journalism building.

The department decided they couldn't argue with results and offered me a full-time teaching position. Not tenured, but tenure-track. Besides, I had a few tricks up my sleeve that would make sure I got that tenure when the time came.

The pay was peanuts, sure, but there was a supreme joy in getting paid to torture liberal arts majors for an hour a day. And it’s not like I had to do any real work other than showing up for that hour a day.

Sure some might argue that was fraud or wage-theft or whatever, but what can I say? Old habits ran deep. I might’ve saved the city, but that didn’t mean I’d gone completely legit. Much to Fialux’s annoyance.

Besides, the new job would also let me make sure no more journalism students with megalomaniacal ambitions managed to slip through the cracks.

“I’ll be pretending to be stuck in office hours until around 3:30,"" I replied.

""My last class is over at four,"" Selena said.

""Any idea what we should get for dinner tonight?"" I asked.

I was in the mood for Chinese, but I didn't get a chance to give voice to that thought. Just as I opened my mouth there was a loud explosion off in the distance. I turned in the direction of the noise even as people around us started screaming and running in the opposite direction. 

Most of the students on campus had learned their lesson: super powered disasters could happen anywhere. Past heroic interventions avoiding campus for whatever reason was no guarantee future heroic interventions would do the same.

Nobody stood around and gawked anymore when there was an attack on the city. That was for damn sure.

I turned just in time to catch a glimpse of whatever it was. Or, it would probably be more accurate to say I turned in time to catch the second whatever it was tearing through the atmosphere and slamming into the city off in the distance. There was another loud explosion followed by debris rising up, and then smoke.

Yeah, something was definitely going down over there.

I pulled out my wrist computer and did a few quick calculations, then looked up. Just in time to see another thing fly overhead, tearing through the atmosphere and causing windows to rattle around us as it landed closer to the university. People screamed and started sprinting in the opposite direction.

What had been an orderly evacuation of the university was rapidly becoming a panicked terrified flight. Someone tripped over a desk in front of us and overpriced coffee spilled everywhere.

I never understood how all these poor college students could afford all these super expensive drinks. All that student loan bubble money at work, I guess.

Off in the distance there was an eerie humming noise and a saucer shaped object on top of three telescoping legs rose from the smoke and debris. I pulled up one of my roving drones that I kept floating over the city for just such an occasion.

I had to run it manually, but I was getting back into the swing of doing this stuff old school. Plus I’d worked up some automations that weren’t gaining sapience any time soon.

A holoprojection jumped up from my wrist and Fialux leaned in and peered at it. I figured it was safe enough to pull the projection up. It's not like anyone was paying attention to us anyways.

Yup, definitely a tripod of some sort. As we watched the three-dimensional holoprojection a metal arm with a nasty glowing tip stuck out from the top, rotated slightly, and blasts of energy started flying. The sound of a crackling energy weapon followed by booming explosions reached us a few seconds after the light from the projection.

I rolled my eyes. ""Alien invasion.""

Fialux sighed. ""Damn it, I was hoping for Italian tonight.""

I grinned. ""There'll be plenty of time for that after we kicked ET's ass.""

There was nothing like getting a good workout in before dinner.

I stood and ripped my blouse aside, buttons flying in every direction, my Night Terror logo appearing on my suit underneath. Fialux stood and did the same.

It was time to get to work.

I have been drinking store brought cold brew for well over a year, possibly year and a half now and I've grown to love it. I've tried brands like bizzy, chameleon, la colombe, and I just recently bought a bottle of califia farms to try too, with bizzy and chameleon being my favorites. 

Over the last several weeks I have been increasingly interested in getting into making my own instead of always buying it, especially after finding this sub. I've done a lot of reading here and there's so many different opinions and ways to do it that I've found myself overwhelmed. I've also spent a good amount of time looking into bean grinders, bodum french presses (I like the 34oz one), aeropresses, cold brew pitchers, coffee beans, recipes and ratios, the whole nine yards. I also have some of the Monin syrups that I can mess around with too. I also found a cold brew pitcher with a mesh screen in the middle of it that I may try out.

What I'm mainly here to ask you all is this- where does one begin with all of this? Should I just grab a french press, a bean grinder, and some beans and experiment? What about aeropresses? How long should I let it steep for? What should I look for in a bean grinder? I have been considering getting a manual one, as I wouldn't be making huge batches at one time, at least not starting out, and I'm holding myself to a tighter budget. 

As for the beans, what types/roasts are typically the best? I've seen some of you saying lighter, some darker, and everything in between. I have found that I do tend to enjoy chocolate notes in mine, as well as caramel. Thank you all for any advice/tips you may have that you can share.",3,1747263860.0,coldbrew,8,0.67,False
1kmt7no,https://www.reddit.com/r/RDR2/comments/1kmt7no/my_review/,my review,"I had thought that The Witcher 3 was the pinnacle of open-world storytelling. The world, the people, the muck—most of all the muck—was better than anything I'd ever known. And yet, I played Red Dead Redemption 2, and it was to walk into a painting that told you quietly about honor and peaches from cans. You do not play as Arthur Morgan—you become Arthur Morgan. His words are your words. His beard is your beard. I named his horse ""Chair"" and cried when Chair ran into a cliff. Chair knew what he was doing. Anyway, the game's introduction hours were tough. Snow, cold, hunger. The traditional cowboy tutorial.

And then time gets foggy. You wake up in a camp and you're different now. Different from the one who slept before. Different as the one who cleans rifles and drinks coffee like they matter. I once spent four real hours chasing a squirrel. I think I was on a mission. The campfire was talking about me. I attempted to give meat and accidentally gave away my boots. Did you ever gaze into the eyes of a virtual deer and remember your ex? No? Try this game. There's a spot—maybe Chapter 3 or so—where the rain comes down just right and you can capture regret in the thunder. I was likely fishing. Or maybe I was simply sitting beside the lake, wondering if my horse had forgiven me for dynamite-ing it.

Maxwell was his name. Golden retriever. Huge, stupid, heart of flames. Once carried a watermelon in his mouth six miles and never let it fall. Just walked. Whenever I had a fight with my parents, he'd sit between us as a living truce. Saw him staring at a blank wall one day, not moving at all, as if remembering something that was about to happen. And I swear—knowing things. Not in a ""go get the paper"" type of manner. No. In a ""there's something in the crawlspace and it's got memories of Vietnam"" kind of manner. He would have liked Red Dead Redemption 2. He would have liked currying the horse and highjacking the trains and apologising later on when you roll over a nun accidentally. I still see him, occasionally. In the fog. Along the rail lines.

In any case, I stole a bank and I burned my hat inadvertently. And I woke up in a swamp in someone else's pants. Dutch told me that he had a plan but all I saw in his eyes were rotisserie chicken. I shot a bird out of the sky and when it dropped down, it murmured the phrase ""Chapter Five."" I never went to Chapter Five. I think it only happens when you think hard enough. My horse disintegrated. My gun has a consciousness. I gazed at the sun set for six hours in the game and forgot my name. A guy named Gavin just kept screaming for himself. I answered once, and he screamed. That's when I knew the game was me.

10 out of 10. Red Dead Redemption 2 is the best game ever made about America, cowboys, and the slow decay of reality. I haven't seen my family in days. I comb my own hair and say ""Easy, girl"" to myself. I tried to fast travel but ended up inside a memory. The map is infinite if you walk diagonally. Arthur once talked to me. He explained to me that Maxwell forgives me. I think I'm ready now. Ready for the epilogue. Or breakfast. Either one.",3,1747263764.0,RDR2,1,1.0,False

My question is how does it feel initially after taking the first dose? Were you able to get anything done or feel any improvement within that first day or week? Does it really take a week to feel results or should I brace for some side effects from your individual experience? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!!

From the files of the Central Ohio Paranormal Research Group:

**Witness Statement**  
**Name:** Amanda ███████  
**Date received:** October 3rd, 2019  
**Date & Time:** August 29th, 2019, 12:34 A.M.  
**Location:** Parking lot of Newton's Plaza strip mall, Bougain, Ohio  
**Statement:**

Earlier that day \[n.b.: Aug. 28th\], I just… felt this need to go to Newton’s. I rationalized it at the time, just sort of, that I had to go get groceries, like I woke up and had some physical discomfort and just thought “oh yeah, I need to go to Trader Joe’s.” When I drove over, maybe about 2:30 in the afternoon, I got out of my car and just sort of stared off into the empty air for five minutes. It wasn’t very windy, but a tree next to the parking lot was swaying gently. I went inside and did my shopping and came out and the wind had picked up again, so I kind of just shrugged it off. Then I went home, and the rest of the day was pretty normal. I made dinner, watched some Netflix, played with my cat. I tried to go to sleep around when I normally do, oh, like 11:00, but I couldn’t.

Then, after midnight, I just decided to stop trying to sleep and without really thinking about it, I got into my car and drove back to the strip mall parking lot. It just felt like this uncontrollable urge, way stronger than the feeling I rationalized earlier in the day. When I got there, I parked under a street light, and waited. Then, after a few minutes, at exactly 12:34 (at least if my car clock was accurate), I was shocked by a bright light suddenly flashing outside of my car. I frantically got out and looked up, and saw what looked like an oversized owl flying in the sky overhead, briefly landing in the branches of a tree before flying again, just sort of making a big circle above me. Then, the owl’s face lit up like a searchlight, which must have been the light that I saw. A huge beam of light searched the ground while the owl flew around, until it landed right on me and stopped moving around. While the beam of light was on me, my eyes hurt, even when I closed them. It felt like forever under the burning light but I guess it must have only been a moment because then I heard a man’s voice say “Hello, may you help me?”

When I opened my eyes the light was gone, the owl was gone, and there were two figures standing in front of me. One was a tall man in a suit who had his left hand extended, I guess the guy who said hello, and he was entirely black and white, head to toe. The yellow streetlamp gave everything that sort of orange-ish color, and he stood out like a photo cut-out against the light and the shadow. Next to him was a hunched-over ape with an upside-down pyramid where its head would be. The ape made a buzzing noise and tugged at the black-and-white man’s coat and gestured at me. He quieted it with a single gesture of his right hand.

The black-and-white man introduced himself and shook my left hand. He said his name was “Mr. Touch” and he repeated his original question, and I, before I could think, said yes. He asked me all sorts of questions that honestly just made me confused, like how old my children were (I don’t have any), how many electrical outlets were in my house, how close I lived to a power line, how many cardinals I had seen in the last month, if I knew the sound of a barn owl, if I owned any calculators, that sort of thing. After the interrogation, he told me that he needed me to buy a fresh notebook, it couldn’t be one I already had, and write down an inventory of all the different textures that I found in a week. Then, he said, he would reach out to me again, and take the notebook with him. After this, he shook my left hand again, and began to leave, although the pyramid-ape lingered and, well I guess I can’t say “stared” because it didn’t have eyes, but its head was just sort of fixated on me, until Mr. Touch made a sort of whistling noise that both made the ape bound after him and made me snap out of the sort of mental haze I was in. I watched as Mr. Touch and his ape walked away until I couldn’t see them anymore.

Over the course of the next week, so that’d be from August 29th to September 4th (Mr. Touch called me back on the 5th), I carried around this notebook I bought at OfficeMax, just one of those spiral-bound college-rule ones, and wrote down every distinct texture I came into contact with. I wrote down different kinds of cloth textures, the faux leather of car seats, plastic bottles, rough cinder blocks and bricks, soft slimy yogurt, smooth blades of grass and the feeling of thorns catching on my clothes as I walked by. Filled up a pretty good chunk of that notebook, not the whole thing though. It kind of became an obsession. My friends thought it was weird that I would pull out this notebook and write down the feelings of different glasses at the bar when we’d hang out. But like, I had to do it. When people asked me, I couldn’t really explain it, not just because they’d think I was crazy for talking about meeting Mr. Touch, but also because I didn’t really have a rationalization for it other than the feeling of just having to do it. Every night that week, my phone would ring, and I’d hear a series of beeps, which increased each night. On the 5th night \[n.b.: Sept. 2nd\], so I guess after a work week had passed, I saw the owl’s searchlight outside my window.

On the night of the 5th, at 12:34 A.M. \[n.b.: Sept. 6th\], the phone rang again, and after the beeps, Mr. Touch spoke over the phone and asked how I was doing. Him asking that felt like a weight being lifted off of my shoulders. I told him I was alright, and he asked if I did what he requested, and I said yes. He then promised that he would visit me at my home the next night, at the same time \[i.e. 12:34 A.M., Sept. 7th\], and then I guess handed the phone over to the ape because then the line was filled with such a loud buzzing that filled my ears that I had to hang up. He knocked on my door at exactly 12:34 A.M. the next day, shook my left hand, and extended his right hand for the notebook. After I gave it to him, he said “I like what you’ve done with the place,” and then promised me that he would reach out to me again in the near future, but I haven’t heard from him since. When he visited, I could see over his shoulder that the ape was standing on the sidewalk across the street from my house.

**News article from The Bougain Reporter, September 9th, 2019**  
**Local Teenager Found Dead in Bedroom Under Unclear Circumstances**

Bougain mother Xiao ████ awoke Monday morning to a terrible scene in her home. Her son, David, was found dead in his room when he was unresponsive to his mother’s reminders to get ready for school. David’s mother was reportedly in shock, stating “It’s strange, but it’s almost too much for me to cry… I can’t believe this happened.” Police and paramedics were called to the scene, but little could be done by the time they arrived.

“It was like nothing else I’ve seen before,” said Officer Steve ██████. Police are entirely uncertain as to the cause of death, having ruled out suicide. “While a final determination will have to wait until the release of the coroner’s report, this does not seem like something someone would or even could do to themselves. A head injury like that isn’t self-inflicted.” Despite the condition of the body indicating homicide, no signs of forced entry were present in the home. Two mismatched footprints, one of a yet-unidentified dress shoe and another footprint resembling a chimpanzee or bonobo, were found in the garden behind the house. The relation of these footprints to the death of David █████ is unclear.

The family of David █████ requests that all well wishes be sent to the page on the obituaries website, and that friends of the deceased can make a donation to a charity of their choice in his memory.

So if you’re not familiar, there was this real nasty murder in Bougain, Ohio a few years back, though they never actually caught whoever did it. But some of the photos of the body of the “Bougain Boy” that were taken by police got leaked and ended up somewhere on the deep web or whatever, except nobody can really find them. IK they’re on the Lost Media Wiki as NSFL lost media but I really want to see them. If even just to find out what was so weird about the body. They said in the news that it can’t possibly have been self-inflicted. I heard rumors that the kid’s head caved in from the inside or something. Like his brain was just gone and there wasn’t anything inside to keep the skull the right shape. Caved in like wet origami. Nasty shit!!! If anyone has the og photos pls DM me, or even if you just might know where someone can find them. IK i’ll get shit from the Lost Media Wiki ppl for looking for this but I just gotta see.

Sorry for not responding to any of your emails or calls. I’ve been really busy with Mr. Touch. He did communicate with me again, about a month after I gave you my original statement. He called me and I heard the beeping again. And he said that if I built a certain kind of transceiver I’d be able to hear him in my head without having to use the formality of a telephone. I guess he could only use landlines until I made the transceiver. He slipped a piece of paper under my door with the design on it. Well I think it was the ape that gave it to me. I heard its buzzing through the door.

After I built the transceiver to his specifications I heard him in my head. His voice was like a whisper. He thanked me for making an inventory of textures. He said it made his job so much easier. I wanted to ask him what his job was but the question got stuck in my throat. He told me that I shouldn’t worry about anything I saw in the news. News people always lie about things, he said. I honestly didn’t know what he was talking about. But he seemed so certain about it. I stopped checking the news after he told me that. COVID honestly passed me by. Mr. Touch kept me safe from it, so long as I had the transceiver with me. I built a second one to put it in my car.

He asked me to do a few more texture inventories after that. It actually wasn’t as frequent as I thought it was going to be. Just every few months or so. Then he’d come by, knock on my door, shake my left hand, and take it back with him. One of those times I saw a second ape with him with a cylinder for a head. He never told me their names.

I don’t really remember when exactly this was but one day he took me out to dinner. Since it was after midnight we had to go to a Denny’s. I actually quite like Denny’s. I ordered pancakes and coffee. He only got a milkshake, and he told the waitress to make it as thick as she could. He said he wanted it to be like fog you can cut with a butterknife. I remember she rolled her eyes and he smiled. That was actually the first time I ever saw him smile. He asked me if, after I do my 8th texture inventory, if I’d like to go see his home. I told him yes. I was on my 6th one at that point so it didn’t seem like it’d be too far off. He said that nobody has televisions there because everyone receives perfect images inside their head. And that everybody is colorblind and there isn’t any racism or anything like that. He told me that people there don’t experience things the same. Too loud or too sharp noises are bad for them. But thick things, like his milkshake, they’re good for them. He said that the fruit there is like sand when you bite into it. Thick, wet sand. I’m sending you this email because I’ve honestly been kicking myself for not emailing you sooner with this. He called me the other day and he asked me to do my 8th texture inventory for him. For a week after that I’ve been writing down everything I touch. I don’t really care about what I see. Just what I touch. When I finish this, he’ll take me to where he comes from, and I’ll come back and I’ll tell you all about it. I’ll bring my phone to take pictures of it so I can show you. I just wanted to touch base and let you know before I go. Hope you’re all having a good day, talk to you later.

Sincerely,  
Amanda

-housemade syrups 
-manual espresso machines (although I also know how to operate an Eversys)
-latte art and traditional sizes
-more streamlined menu with emphasis on drink quality 

Can anyone recommend any coffee shops in Canada that are like this (any/all provinces)? Also what do I need to know about working in a Canadian coffee shop?",2,1747263518.0,baristajobs,0,1.0,False

1kmt2qq,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/1kmt2qq/that_hatted_cats_coffee_rant/,That Hatted Cat's coffee rant,"Since there's been a lot of discourse about Teen Titans Go and a lot of backlash to the Teen Titans Go backlash lately, That Hatted Cat's gonna drop some context on the track. Listen up. I want you to imagine your favorite coffee place, now imagine a particular coffee they had being your favorite one. Okay, now that coffee is gone, that coffee ended on an unsatisfying cliffhanger. Yes, the finale to the coffee was supposed to be an unsatisfying cliffhanger, that was what the team behind the coffee decided to do, but that's not exactly information everyone's immediately gonna have access to. Anyway later on you hear a new project related to that old coffee is coming and you think ""Aww shit it's coffee time mothefuckers!"". Anyway the new coffee's a completely different kind of coffee, it's a comedy and it isn't funny. Now you don't hate comedy coffees, but Coffee Network already has a lot of comedy coffees anyway, and it keeps screwing over its action coffees! On top of all of this, Coffee Network keeps doing marathons of Coffee Titans Go. It even did a marathon of Coffee Titans Go before the friggin finale to Regular Coffee! ""If you don't like Coffee Titans Go, just don't order it!"" is a dumb take when the only coffee available at friggin Coffee Network while you're waiting for the coffee you actually like to be availabe is Coffee Titans Go again! Nowadays this isn't as much of an issue, Coffee Titans Go no longer rules over Coffee Network with an iron coffee fist, but if you wanna know why people hate this friggin coffee so much, it's because they think it's bastardization of a coffee they dearly miss, and it's because Coffee Network favored it over other beloved coffees like Infinity Coffee. Coffee means a lot to a lot of people, people care about coffee. Maybe they care too much sometimes. But damnit, caring about coffee in of itself should not be considered cringe! The people who make coffee care about coffee, do you think that's cringe? I'm gonna talk about Coffee Cats Roar now, because there were two major groups that got mad about Coffee Cats Roar. One group was stupid anti woke idiots getting mad that they ""made the coffee woke"" and the other was folks reasonably pissed that Coffee Cats Roar existed after the 2011 Coffee Cats brew was discontinued way too god damn early and this is what we get afterwards, a hyperactive unfunny comedy coffee with too much god damn sugar that serves that rub salt in the wound of a lost action coffee like literally exactly what happened with Coffee Titans Go. Plus even outside of resurecting a coffee that was previously an action coffee in favor of bringing it back as a hyperactive comedy coffee with too much god damn sugar, Coffee Network also brought back Coffeepuff Girls in 2016 and the the 2016 version sucked! But that's a whole other coffee story and there's way less people who'll get on your ass about complaining about that coffee. 

Anyway, yes, complaining on sight every time there's a hyperactive comedy coffee isn't productive, the Scooby Brew that came after Mystery Drink is funny and well written even if the coffee art style for it looks too much like Family Coffeeguy. Rise Of The Coffee Mutant Ninja Turtles got slept on too much due to the Coffee Titans Go backlash in spite of being a certified coffee banger. But let it be known that I recognize these things and still hate Coffee Titans Go. Now if you like this particular coffee, that's fine. I ain't trying to start a beef with anyone over coffee. But I think acting like everyone who hated Coffee Titans Go is some pretentious dickweed who hates fun isn't productive. The Coffee Titans Go hate shouldn't have carried over to other to other coffees (except Coffeecats Roar, that one was deserved and the comparison was practically inevitable) but there were plenty of reasonable things to be pissed about with regards to Coffee Titans Go.

""People were too mean about it""

Any time there's controversy about anything on the internet there's gonna be some fuckin dipshits with no life who takes things too far. That's not a good argument against thinking Coffee Titans Go sucks (or being not particularly fond of Paper Mariotea Origami King). I think the hatedom for Hazbin Coffee and Helluvacoffee is insane and unhinged and desperately needs to go outside and touch and or smoke some grass, but you're never gonna hear me say someone's automatically like those idiots just because they don't like either of those coffees. Though I would like to point out to some of the less perceptive people in the Coffeevincible fandom that as a fan of Coffeevincible, Hazbin Coffee and Helluvacoffee I'd love if Amazon gave Coffeevincible better coffeemation funding and Hazbin Coffee more coffeesodes per season so it could tell its story with better pacing. Stop saying they should defund Hazbin Coffee and give the money to Coffeevincible, Hazbin Coffee also isn't being given enough shit to do its shit at maximum potential, a problem you should frankly be able to relate to. Jesus Coffee Christ! Anyway, that's all. Coffee discourse on the internet is really fuckin exhausting, which is ironic considering what coffee does. Maybe I'll talk about the bad faith criticism surrounding the Hellacoffeeverse some other time but not now, I'm tired. In conclusion, stop generalizing about people based on their coffee opinions. Stop bullying people over the coffee they like and don't like. Just be fuckin sane about coffee. Please. That's all, thanks for reading this.",0,1747263390.0,copypasta,1,0.5,False
