Admiral Kishimoto walked into the Black Hole, the last of the high-ranking officers to attend this meeting. He looked around at the others as he slowly walked to his seat and took a seat in his designated chair.

""Nice of you to finally join us,"" General Marcus said as he looked around. ""Now, can we get this thing started?"" He asked, annoyed at the delay.

""Yes, we can,"" Admiral Williams said as she turned on the 3D projector in the middle of the table.

""First, I got to know, did his gracious jackass try to blackmail you?"" Kishimoto asked, suspecting the answer.

""Yes, but we have enough dirt on him to end his political career and bury him in legal trouble,"" she said as she adjusted the view on the projector.

""What are we looking at here Williams?"" Khabishove asked, staring at the POV someone's helmet caught.

""This is the POV Henry001's helmet caught on his first mission. Now, any other questions?"" Williams snapped at the General.

""No,"" He said as he fortified his stare at her.

""Great, now let's get this started. We have some stuff to get through,"" Williams said as she started the footage. The four leaders watched the footage, showing looks of horror at the detachment and carnage that Henry deployed, except for Williams, who wore a grin. They watched as Henry swept through the battlefield, killing anyone he crossed. Williams paused the footage on a UHC tank.

""Now this is something that I already took care of. A certain doctor received a visit from Aave040. I will show you the footage of that in just a second,"" Williams said as she continued the footage from Henry's mission on Tak-Val. They watched as Henry continued his slaughter, both amazed and concerned at the same time. The ultimate test came when he was presented with the options to blow the reactors or not. He chose to kill everyone on that planet, innocent or not.

""What have we done?"" Marcus said as he put his face in his palms and then let them slide down.

""We have created the perfect weapon, one not burdened by morals, and emotionally bankrupt. This is the pinnacle of the Vanguard program,"" Williams said, smiling ear to ear. She was more than happy with the success of Henry.

""Yes, but at what cost you stupid bitch!"" Marcus said, throwing his chair at the wall.

""Don't act all high and mighty now, you arrogant bastard. You had your chance to say no, but you didn't,"" Williams yelled back as Kishimoto and Khabishove watched.

""Well I am putting an end to this right now! I am going to the press to tell them the truth,"" Marcus said, walking to the door, but a new voice stopped everyone.

""Now now, let's not get too hasty. How about you take a seat?"" Albert said, taking his form on the 3D projector.

""How in the fuck did you get here?"" Williams said in shock.

""Oh Admiral, it was easy, you brought me in here,"" Albert said, his avatar smiling at her. ""Now let us get down to business. I have a few demands,"" Albert started before Khabishove cut him off.

""I am not going to let some computer make demands,"" Khabishove said before Albert continued.

""If you do not comply with my demands, I have thousands of fragments all over the place, I will wage war on the four of you, and the entirety of the UHC government,"" Albert said as he pointed his pipe at Khabishove.

""You don't have the ability to create fragments or clones,"" Williams said, trying to call what she perceived as a bluff.

""Williams, on the night that you decided to give Lin the Vanguard program, you went on a date with him, and went back to your office where the two of you did the nasty. Right now, I am a fragment. I sent myself in the transmission of the last mission report, and Kishimoto is late because he was flirting with the barista at the base's coffee shop,"" Albert said, looking around at the others. ""Need I continue?"" He asked.

""No, we get your point. What are the demands?"" Williams asked, losing her smile.

""First, I want Valasquez stationed with Henry. It would do that boy well. Second is I want you to make sure that you don't have any more bad intel. What happened on Tak-Val is unacceptable. Had that been the Liam, Sofia, and Imani, one or all of them could have died. The third is I want the crew of the New Hope and Henry put on one of the Furtim missile carriers. I know we need him to do dangerous things, but I want him to have the best shot possible."" Albert said and looked directly at Williams. She nodded her head, knowing the AI had escaped their control.

""Our only means of controlling him now is Henry,"" She thought to herself.

""Tomorrow, the ship will be in dock, and I'll send out the orders to the Captain. Don't make me regret this,"" Williams said, looking dead into Albert's blue light figure.

""One more thing, Admiral, don't try sending Aave after Henry, he is too strong for her, and any Vanguard would sooner kill you than another Vanguard. With that, Albert faded out, and the footage switched over to the fight Henry had with the devourer, leaving the leaders even more baffled.

""Why do you think that he switched the footage?"" Marcus asked.

""Why else you dipshit, it's a warning,"" Kishimoto quipped back.

""He left some notes, Mission to retrieve AI complete, no further issues,"" Khabishove said as he looked at the projector.

""I say that we just give the blasted thing what it wants. We can't afford to wage a war on a rogue AI right now. Shipyards are being built faster than anticipated, and we are putting out hundreds of ships a day. The reports earlier said that we are now up to ten titan-class ships, and one hundred destroyers, almost a thousand battle ships, and tens of thousands of smaller ships,"" Williams said as she brought the conversation back on track.

""Can you play that footage of the traitor. If it wasn't for him and his threats, we would never have had to go public about the Operation Vanguard."" Marcus said as he crossed his arms and leaned back.

Williams silently swiped the projector to switch the footage over to Aave's helmet. They watched as the camera started to record when she walked into Sanchez's home, found her way to his room, and sat in the chair that he had in the corner. Williams fast-forwarded the footage to the moment that Sanchez entered his home. The wrinkled, brown-skinned man's face dropped the moment he spotted Aave.

""I guess the jig is up, but before you kill me, wouldn't you like to see your family? I think I have a photo of them on my computer?"" Sanchez asked. Before he could even fathom what happened, Aave closed the distance between the two of them and put a plasma blade through his stomach.

""I don't need to see some fabricated photos. The other Vanguards are my family."" Aave said as she kneeled over the disgraced doctor, who looked up at her blue visor, terror in his eyes. ""It's your lucky day, I have orders to take you back to Earth, alive. If it wasn't for that, I would have killed you. However, they didn't say I couldn't ruff you up a bit,"" She said as she grabbed up the aged man and started to carry him to the shuttle just one block away. As she got closer to the shuttle, its active camo started to dissipate, revealing a completely black shuttle. She opened the sliding door and through the old man in roughly before she climbed in. She closed the door and cuffed the old man to the floor. After she secured Sanchez, she got into the cockpit and took off.

Morning light filtered through the blinds of Nick's dorm room, casting thin golden lines across his bed as he sat at his desk, surrounded by notes and documents. He'd spent half the night in a rabbit hole of research after Tuesday's Business Leaders Association meeting, the mysterious message from Eidolon still haunting his thoughts.

*Who is M.E., and how does he know about my investments?*

His secure laptop displayed dozens of browser tabs‚Äîcorporate registries, financial databases, news archives, and social media profiles. The Eidolon Corporation had proven surprisingly difficult to trace, existing in the shadowy edges of the business world, visible only through careful examination of subsidiary relationships and patent filings.

""A ghost company,"" Nick muttered, rubbing his tired eyes.

What he'd uncovered was fascinating. Eidolon Corporation appeared to be a technology investment firm specializing in neural interface research and quantum computing‚Äîfields that overlapped directly with Callahan Industries' interests. But unlike Callahan's public-facing corporate empire, Eidolon operated almost entirely through shell companies and silent partnerships.

The most intriguing discovery had come from a footnote in a patent dispute three years earlier. Callahan had attempted to acquire exclusive rights to a breakthrough in non-invasive neural scanning technology. The patent examiner had rejected their claim, citing ""prior art"" from a researcher whose funding traced back to Eidolon subsidiaries.

""They're competitors,"" Nick realized, the pieces clicking into place. ""Eidolon is positioning against Callahan in the neural interface space.""

The implications were significant. If Callahan had a corporate rival with similar technological capabilities but different objectives‚Äîespecially with Harrington's neural interface lecture looming tomorrow‚Äîit created potential leverage. Or additional danger.

The most promising lead had come from a tech conference attendee list from two years ago. Marcus Eidolon had been listed as a keynote speaker on ""The Future of Thought Interface Technology,"" though mysteriously, no video or transcript of his presentation had ever been released. The only photo Nick could find showed a tall man in his fifties with silver-streaked dark hair and intense blue eyes that seemed to evaluate the photographer through the lens. Something about his expression triggered a sense of familiarity that Nick couldn't place.

His phone vibrated with an incoming message‚Äîa secure communication from Maggie: ""Need to meet. New information on R. Library, special collections room, 11 AM. Bring the drive.""

Nick checked the time: 9:17 AM. He was already late for Biology. He quickly gathered his materials, cursing silently. Missing class would disrupt the normal patterns he'd established, potentially alerting his watchers that something had changed.

As he closed the laptop and began preparing for the day, his mind continued processing the Eidolon mystery. The company's interest in his investment patterns suggested they had surveillance capabilities comparable to Callahan's‚Äîa concerning thought, yet potentially useful if they were truly rivals rather than allies.

The electronic hum from the ceiling vent was a constant reminder of his monitored state. With his enhanced perception, Nick could detect the subtle electromagnetic signature of the surveillance device‚Äîa soft, rhythmic pulse that most people would never notice. Each time it recorded and transmitted, the signature flickered slightly, like a digital heartbeat.

*Even with technology this sophisticated, they haven't accounted for mana-enhanced senses,* Nick thought with grim satisfaction. *Their blind spot is my advantage.*

He maintained his routine precisely, giving whoever was listening nothing unusual to report. The blue energy beneath his skin remained dormant, but present‚Äîlike a sleeping current ready to be awakened at his command. He was careful to keep his laptop screen angled away from where a camera might be positioned, though his enhanced senses had detected only audio surveillance devices so far. A small mercy‚Äîthey could hear him, but not see what he was researching.

He would need to be even more careful until he could secure his off-campus apartment. The Westlake Arms unit wouldn't be ready until Friday according to Gloria Reynolds, though he hoped to expedite the process with his newly secured funds from the Helios investment.

*Having a truly secure location will change everything,* Nick thought, imagining a space where he could practice mana techniques without fear of observation. *Time to move my game to the next level.*

The Biology classroom was already half-full when Nick arrived, slipping in as quietly as possible. Professor Godrudson paused momentarily in her lecture, her silver-streaked hair pulled back severely, her intense gaze finding him before returning to her presentation without comment.

""...as we continue our exploration of cellular adaptation to environmental stressors, focusing on neural tissue specifically,"" she was saying as Nick took his seat.

Nick's interest sharpened immediately. The timing seemed too convenient to be coincidental‚Äîa lecture on neural adaptation the day before Harrington's presentation on neural interfaces. With his enhanced perception, he noticed several students he hadn't seen before sitting at the back of the class, their attention focused more on the other students than on Professor Godrudson's slides.

Their auras carried the distinctive signature he was learning to recognize‚Äîthe controlled, methodical energy patterns of trained observers, rather than the chaotic, fluctuating fields of genuine students. They moved with too much precision, their gazes too calculating as they scanned the room.

*More observers. The surveillance is expanding.*

As the lecture progressed, Nick participated strategically, demonstrating knowledge without revealing the full extent of his understanding. When Godrudson displayed electron microscope images of neural mitochondria responding to various stimuli, Nick found himself absorbing the information with unusual clarity‚Äîseeing connections to the Arcadian System that he hadn't previously recognized.

The mitochondria's energy production pathways bore striking similarities to the mana channels he'd observed flowing through his own body during meditation. The cellular structures adapted to stress by forming new connections‚Äîexactly as his neural pathways seemed to be adapting to channel mana energy.

""The human nervous system contains remarkable adaptation mechanisms,"" Godrudson explained, highlighting a particular image. ""When subjected to consistent stimuli over time, neural pathways can fundamentally restructure themselves, creating entirely new response patterns.""

The slide showed false-color images of neural tissue before and after specific stimulation protocols. The ""after"" image revealed new connections and pathways that hadn't existed previously‚Äîa physical restructuring that appeared almost identical to the mana pathways Nick had visualized during his training sessions.

*It's like my brain is physically rewiring itself to accommodate mana flow,* Nick realized, excitement building beneath his carefully neutral expression. *The Arcadian System isn't just energy manipulation‚Äîit's actually creating new neural architecture.*

The implications for Nick's own situation were striking. Was his connection to Arlize the result of some fundamental neural restructuring? Had his death and rebirth somehow created pathways that allowed cross-dimensional consciousness transfer? Were these the same pathways his parents had studied at Callahan Industries?

When class ended, Nick gathered his materials efficiently, noting one of the observers in the back row making notes about which students spoke with Godrudson after class. He deliberately avoided lingering, instead heading directly to the library to prepare for his meeting with Maggie.

As he crossed the quad, Nick subtly enhanced his senses, extending his awareness outward to detect any surveillance. The familiar electromagnetic signature of the military-postured observer pulsed from near the engineering building‚Äîpresent but keeping his distance. Nick maintained his pace, giving no indication he'd detected the tail.

*They're getting bolder,* he thought. *Moving from passive observation to active tracking.*

The quad hummed with the energy of hundreds of students going about their normal lives, blissfully unaware of the surveillance web tightening around them. Nick envied their ignorance for a moment before pushing the thought aside. Knowledge, however uncomfortable, was always preferable to comfortable blindness.

The Literature library's Special Collections room occupied the eastern wing of the third floor, housing rare manuscripts and archived materials that required controlled access. Nick had reserved a private study room there for ""historical research,"" providing a plausible reason for his presence while ensuring minimal surveillance.

The space smelled of old paper and wood polish, the hushed atmosphere creating a buffer against the outside world. Soft light filtered through tall windows, illuminating dust motes that danced in the air like miniature constellations.

Maggie was already waiting when he arrived, her casual student appearance‚Äîoversized hoodie, messy bun, coffee thermos‚Äîbelying the intensity in her eyes as she glanced up from a stack of archival materials.

""You weren't followed?"" she asked without preamble as he slid into the seat across from her.

""Not directly,"" Nick replied, scanning the room with both normal and enhanced perception. ""Though there's increased attention today. New observers in Biology class, and the surveillance in my dorm has intensified. The listening devices in my ceiling vent have been upgraded, probably more audio bugs I haven't spotted yet.""

Maggie's expression darkened. ""Audio surveillance is standard procedure for initial monitoring. They're listening but not watching‚Äîwhich gives us a small advantage. We can still communicate through written notes if necessary.""

""I've identified a student named Jordan who appears to be reporting on me,"" Nick continued. ""He lives across the hall, conveniently befriended me the first day, and has been monitoring my movements and academic performance.""

""They've assigned a dedicated handler already,"" Maggie muttered, clearly disturbed by this escalation. ""That's typically reserved for high-value targets or significant threats.""

""There's more,"" Nick added. ""They're escalating beyond Jordan. I've noticed a military-postured observer following me between classes, and yesterday someone attempted to access my room while I was out.""

Maggie tapped her fingers nervously on the table. ""This goes beyond standard monitoring. They're treating you as a priority acquisition target."" She reached into her bag, pulling out what looked like an ordinary pen. ""The spectrum analyzer I gave you covers electronic signatures, but this detects focused audio surveillance specifically. It vibrates when directional microphones are actively targeting your position‚Äîcompletely passive detection so it won't trigger countermeasures.""

Nick accepted the device, recognizing its value. The pen felt heavier than it should, with subtle ridges that distinguished it from ordinary writing implements. ""Perfect complement to what I already have.""

""It also contains a white noise generator,"" Maggie added. ""Twist the cap clockwise three times to activate. Creates a sound barrier that confuses audio surveillance without being obvious enough to trigger suspicion. Makes it sound like mundane background noise to listeners.""

When Nick held the pen, he could detect a faint electromagnetic field emanating from within‚Äîsophisticated technology packed into an innocuous package. The field pattern reminded him of the energy signatures he'd observed in electronic devices when using his mana-enhanced perception.

""They're definitely escalating monitoring across the board,"" Maggie continued. ""Three more surveillance cameras were installed on campus overnight, all covering paths between academic buildings."" She slid an archival folder across the table. ""But that's not why I needed to meet.""

Nick opened the folder carefully. Inside was a printout of an academic journal article from fifteen years ago, authored by Dr. Francisco Valiente‚Äîhis grandfather‚Äîand co-authored by Dr. Marcus Eidolon.

""Your grandfather and someone named Marcus Eidolon worked together,"" Maggie explained. ""The paper was published in an obscure Colombian neurophysiology journal, never translated to English. I only found it because I was specifically researching your family connections after learning your parents worked for Callahan.""

Nick scanned the Spanish text, his heart accelerating as one name jumped from the page.

*Grandpa.*

He hadn't heard that voice in two years. He could almost smell the tobacco and pine of the old study in Bogot√°, where his grandfather used to mutter through his research, swatting Nick away with a gentle hand and a smile. The memory was so vivid that for a moment, the blue energy beneath his skin pulsed in response, creating a brief shimmer along his fingertips that he quickly suppressed.

""He was working on this back then,"" Nick murmured, voice thick with something he didn't have time to name.

Scanning the paper again, his mind refocused. The article discussed theoretical approaches to measuring ""bioelectric potential in hereditary neural pathways""‚Äîacademic terminology that could potentially describe aspects of what he now knew as mana. The text contained diagrams of neural structures remarkably similar to the patterns he'd observed flowing through his own body during meditation.

*This must be who sent me that message,* Nick realized silently, careful not to reveal his earlier contact from Eidolon. *He worked with my grandfather on research related to our family abilities.*

""There's more,"" Maggie continued, turning to her laptop. ""I managed to access some of my brother's secured files. He had a folder labeled 'Competing Research Initiatives' that contained dossiers on both Callahan and Eidolon.""

She turned the screen toward Nick, showing a complex relationship map. The visualization resembled a neural network itself‚Äînodes representing key researchers and institutions, with connections flowing between them like synaptic pathways.

""Callahan and Eidolon have been competing for decades in neural interface technology, but they're approaching it from fundamentally different directions. Callahan's approach is mechanical‚Äîexternal technology interfacing with neural tissue. Eidolon's research focuses on awakening and enhancing innate capabilities already present in certain genetic lineages.""

Nick felt his pulse quicken, though he kept his expression neutral. This aligned perfectly with what he was discovering about his own family heritage and the Arcadian System.

""According to my brother's notes,"" Maggie said, her tone measured, ""some researchers started with Eidolon's philosophy‚Äînatural enhancement, non-invasive pathways.""

She tapped the folder. ""But they defected. Joined Callahan. Or at least... pretended to.""

""They used Callahan's resources,"" she continued after a beat, ""but behind the scenes, they were pursuing something else entirely.""

""Like my parents might have done,"" Nick suggested carefully, watching her reaction.

Maggie nodded, unsurprised by his deduction. ""Their names appear in my brother's files as part of a research group that moved from Eidolon-funded projects to Callahan Industries about seven years ago. The notes suggest they were trying to prevent certain Callahan research projects from being weaponized.""

""But something changed about three years ago. Callahan discovered a test subject‚Äîreferred to only as 'Colombian Subject 27'‚Äîwhose neural patterns revealed something revolutionary.""

""What happened to Subject 27?"" Nick asked, already suspecting the answer.

""The subject died during testing,"" Maggie replied, her expression grim. ""At least officially. But my brother's notes suggest the reality was more complex. He believed the subject's consciousness somehow... transferred... during the experiment.""

""Transferred where?"" Nick pressed, his heart racing as pieces began falling into place.

""That's unclear. The notes mention something called 'cross-dimensional consciousness mapping' and 'resonant neural patterns across timelines.'"" Maggie's eyes met his with unusual intensity. ""It sounds almost like‚Äî""

""A soul or consciousness from another world,"" Nick finished, his voice barely audible.

The implications were staggering. If Maggie's brother was right, then Callahan Industries had somehow discovered‚Äîor created‚Äîthe very mechanism that had merged Nick's consciousness with Arlize's. This wasn't just about neural interfaces anymore; it was about technology that could transfer consciousness across dimensions or timelines.

Maggie studied his face, her gaze penetrating. ""You don't seem surprised by this.""

Nick chose his next words carefully. This was the moment to decide how much to reveal to Maggie. She had proven herself resourceful and seemingly trustworthy, but full disclosure about Arlize would sound insane without concrete evidence.

""I've been experiencing... an unusual memory phenomena,"" he admitted. ""Flashes of knowledge I shouldn't have, skills I never learned, abilities that seem to awaken under stress.""

It wasn't the whole truth, but it was enough to establish connection without revealing everything about Arlize or the full extent of his mana capabilities.

Maggie processed this information with remarkable composure. ""That tracks with my brother's theories about neural resonance. He believed certain genetic profiles could act as... receptors... for consciousness patterns beyond normal human experience.""

""And Callahan wants to control this technology,"" Nick said, the implications becoming clearer.

""While Eidolon seems to be pursuing a different approach,"" Maggie added. ""From what I can gather, they're not trying to create artificial interfaces, but rather awaken natural capabilities through some combination of genetic predisposition and targeted stimulation.""

""Like Nexus Virtual Technologies was attempting in my previous‚Äî"" Nick caught himself, but not quickly enough.

Maggie's eyes narrowed. ""Your previous what?""

The slip had been inevitable, Nick realized. The complexity of maintaining partial truths eventually created contradictions that couldn't be explained away. The blue energy beneath his skin pulsed in response to his spike in anxiety, though he kept it contained through sheer force of will.

Nick hesitated, fingers twitching over the edge of the folder. What would Arlize have done? Trusted no one. Not after Serenne. Not after Kadros.

But Maggie wasn't like them. For her, the stakes were real. She was already in the fire.

He looked her in the eye. ""This is going to sound insane,"" he began, making a calculated decision to trust her with more of the truth. ""But I've experienced this timeline before. I lived through this period once already, was betrayed and killed, then somehow awakened two years in the past with all my memories intact‚Äîplus memories and abilities from someone else, someone from what seems like another world entirely.""

He expected disbelief, even mockery, but Maggie simply nodded slowly, her expression thoughtful rather than dismissive.

""Consciousness transference across temporal dimensions,"" she said, as if confirming a hypothesis. ""My brother theorized it was possible under specific circumstances. The neural architecture would need to be compatible‚Äîgenetically predisposed to form certain patterns‚Äîand there would need to be some catastrophic event to trigger the transfer.""

""Like being murdered,"" Nick offered grimly.

""Or like dying during a neural interface experiment,"" Maggie added, her eyes widening with sudden realization. ""Colombian Subject 27‚Äîwhat if they didn't die in the conventional sense? What if their consciousness transferred temporally or dimensionally during Callahan's experiment?""

The implication hung between them, both fascinating and terrifying.

""But why would Callahan be watching me specifically?"" Nick asked, deliberately playing devil's advocate to test her theories.

""That's the question,"" Maggie agreed. ""Unless..."" Her eyes widened slightly. ""Unless they already had reason to monitor you before your academic performance changed. Your parents worked for them. What if they've been watching their children all along, looking for inherited traits or abilities?""

The possibility sent a jolt through Nick's system. The blue energy responded to his emotional surge, briefly creating patterns beneath his skin that resembled circuit diagrams before he suppressed it with conscious effort. It would explain so much‚Äîthe ease with which surveillance had been established, Jordan's immediate placement across the hall, the extensive resources dedicated to monitoring him.

""When did your parents die?"" Maggie asked suddenly.

""Two years ago,"" Nick replied. ""Car accident on a mountain road. At least, that was the official story.""

Maggie's expression darkened. ""According to my brother's files, there was a major security breach at Callahan's research facility around that time. Several key researchers disappeared or died in 'accidents' within the same month.""

""So tomorrow's lecture with Professor Harrington..."" Nick began, processing the implications.

""Is almost certainly a screening process,"" Maggie finished for him. ""They'll be watching your reactions, possibly exposing you to stimuli designed to trigger responses that would confirm their suspicions about your abilities.""

""Then I need to be prepared,"" Nick decided. ""Not just to avoid their traps, but to gather information of my own.""

Maggie pulled a small case from her backpack, opening it to reveal what looked like ordinary glasses with slightly thicker frames than usual.

""Already on it,"" she said with a hint of pride. ""These contain a micro-camera and audio recorder, with local storage rather than wireless transmission to avoid detection. They'll capture everything you see and hear.""

Nick took the glasses, examining them with appreciation. When he held them, his enhanced perception detected subtle electromagnetic signatures emanating from the frames‚Äîsophisticated technology disguised as ordinary eyewear.

""Perfect. But what about countermeasures? If they're planning to trigger responses through specific stimuli...""

""I thought of that too,"" Maggie said, reaching into her bag again. She produced what appeared to be a normal wristwatch. ""This monitors your vitals. If it detects significant spikes in heart rate, body temperature, or other stress indicators, it vibrates‚Äîsubtle enough that only you'll notice, but enough to alert you that something's affecting you.""

""You've thought of everything,"" Nick said, genuinely impressed. ""Why are you helping me this much, Maggie? This goes beyond finding your brother.""

Maggie's expression hardened. ""My brother wasn't just researching neural interfaces. He was documenting Callahan's ethical violations‚Äîhuman experimentation, coercion, corporate espionage. When he disappeared, all his evidence disappeared with him."" She met Nick's eyes directly. ""You're not just a connection to my brother's work‚Äîyou're potentially living proof of what Callahan has been doing. If your consciousness really was transferred, if you really do have unexplained abilities...""

""You need me as evidence,"" Nick concluded.

""I need an ally who has a personal stake in exposing them,"" she corrected. ""And you clearly have abilities or knowledge that make you valuable to them. That makes you dangerous to them. That makes you useful to me.""

Nick nodded slowly. The pragmatic honesty was refreshing‚Äîand made more sense than pure altruism.

""There's something else we should consider,"" Maggie continued. ""If Eidolon is the competitor to Callahan that my brother's research suggests, they might have resources we could use. But corporations don't help people out of kindness.""

Nick considered telling her about Eidolon's message but decided to hold that card close for now. ""I need to know more about Eidolon before making any moves in that direction. Starting with why my grandfather worked with them and what exactly they're after.""

Still, the timing gnawed at him.

Eidolon had stayed silent all this time‚Äîuntil after he bought Helios stock, after he triggered Callahan's attention, after he'd demonstrated just enough potential to matter.

*They've been watching me too,* Nick realized, the implications settling like a weight in his stomach. *Waiting for me to show enough to be worth contacting.*

And the market move had finally flipped a switch.

He checked the time‚Äînearly noon. ""I have Calculus at 2:00. And I need to work on moving some essentials to a secure location soon."" He didn't mention the apartment directly, not wanting to reveal too much, even to Maggie, until he had established it as truly secure.

""Smart move,"" Maggie said, nodding her head. ""Your dorm is definitely compromised. Jordan's assignment is clearly to monitor you directly.""

""By the way,"" Nick said, grabbing his backpack, ""how do you know about the new surveillance?"" He glanced at her, genuinely curious.

Maggie's expression darkened. ""After my brother vanished, I found encrypted files on a backup drive he'd hidden. They contained detailed counter-surveillance techniques developed during his work with Callahan. He knew they were watching him toward the end."" Her fingers traced an invisible pattern on the table. ""I spent months learning everything in those files‚Äînot just to find him, but to protect myself when I did. I've been running sweeps of campus buildings since our first meeting, using passive scanners at key locations that alert me to new electronic signatures.""

Her competence was impressive‚Äîanother reason to consider her a valuable ally.

""I'll maintain the dorm as a decoy,"" Nick explained. ""Keep up appearances while conducting real work elsewhere.""

Maggie nodded, then hesitated before adding, ""There's one more thing. These 'unusual memory phenomena' you mentioned. Have they manifested in any physical ways?""

The question caught Nick off guard. ""What do you mean?""

""My brother's research indicated that subjects with certain neural patterns sometimes displayed unexplained physical capabilities‚Äîenhanced reflexes, heightened senses, even alleged telekinetic events during periods of extreme stress."" Her eyes studied him carefully. ""Has anything like that happened to you?""

Nick considered how much to reveal. She clearly suspected something beyond memory transfer, but telling her about mana manipulation seemed premature. The blue energy beneath his skin pulsed in response to his tension, creating patterns that only he could see.

""I've experienced some... enhancements,"" he admitted cautiously. ""Quicker reflexes, better retention, sensory perception beyond what I had before. Nothing I can fully explain yet.""

""That tracks with my brother's theories,"" Maggie said, her expression neither surprised nor skeptical. ""Whatever Callahan did with Subject 27 might have created a template for consciousness transfer that included physical capabilities. If they discover the full extent of these enhancements‚Äî""

""They won't just want to study me,"" Nick finished. ""They'll want to replicate or weaponize the process.""

""Exactly. Before my brother disappeared, he was conducting tests on neural enhancement through non-invasive stimulation. His results showed promise‚Äîsubtle improvements in reaction time, sensory processing, cognitive function. Callahan immediately classified everything."" Maggie's voice tightened. ""They brought in test subjects‚Äîpeople from outside the university system. My brother refused to continue without proper oversight and threatened to go public. Three days later, his lab was shut down and he was gone.""

As they finished packing their things, Maggie‚Äôs hands hesitated over her bag for a moment. When she finally spoke, her voice was soft,‚ÄúThanks for trusting me earlier‚Ä¶ with your secret. It‚Äôs why I felt I could share more of my brother‚Äôs research with you.‚Äù

Then fixing him with an intense gaze, ‚Äú But I know you haven‚Äôt told me everything.""

Nick kept his expression carefully neutral, though he felt a flicker of surprise at her perceptiveness. He'd been careful with his words, but Maggie's eyes had narrowed slightly when he'd mentioned ""enhancements"" without elaboration, and it seems that she noticed his hesitation when discussing his family heritage‚Äîthe momentary tightening of his fingers on the table edge, perhaps, or the calculated way he'd chosen his words.

""What makes you say that?"" he asked, buying time.

""Three things,"" Maggie replied, ticking them off on her fingers. ""First, your explanation of these 'enhancements' was deliberately vague. Second, when I mentioned telekinetic events, your pupils dilated‚Äîclassic physiological response to recognition. And third,"" she leaned closer, ""you've been subtly scanning the room in patterns identical to those my brother documented in subjects with heightened sensory awareness. Something beyond normal perception.""

Nick met her eyes steadily. ""No,"" he admitted. ""Some things I'm still working to understand myself.""

""Fair enough, I won't push you,"" she said quietly. ""But withholding critical information could get us both caught‚Äîor worse. The more I know about what we're dealing with, the more effectively I can help.""

""I understand,"" Nick said. ""And I appreciate your help more than you know.""

As Maggie left first, disappearing into the library's stacks, Nick remained in the study room for a few more minutes, reviewing what they'd discovered. The blue energy beneath his skin pulsed gently, responding to his contemplative state with flowing patterns that resembled the neural networks on Maggie's computer screen.

The competition between Callahan and Eidolon placed him in a dangerous position, but also created potential opportunities. If he could understand each organization's true objectives, he might find a way to leverage their rivalry to his advantage.

More importantly, the connection between his grandfather and Marcus Eidolon suggested there might be allies with deeper understanding of his family heritage and the nature of mana. If Eidolon had been researching ways to awaken innate abilities rather than create artificial interfaces, their approach aligned more closely with Nick's family tradition.

But trusting either side remained premature. Both corporations had their own agendas, and Nick had no illusions about being anything more than a means to an end for either of them.

As Nick finally gathered his materials to leave, his phone vibrated with a message from an unknown number: ""Westlake Arms application expedited. Apartment ready tomorrow afternoon rather than Friday. Keys available for pickup after 3 PM Thursday. The welcome packet includes information about secure parking options. ‚ÄîGR""

The unexpectedly accelerated timeline was welcome news, though the convenience raised a flag in Nick's mind. The timing felt almost too perfect. He would need to thoroughly sweep the apartment for surveillance devices before fully trusting it as a secure location. Still, having his own space sooner rather than later would give him a critical advantage.

With Harrington's neural interface lecture tomorrow evening and his apartment becoming available the same day, the pieces were falling into place faster than anticipated. Nick would need to balance maintaining his classes, preparing for Harrington's potentially dangerous lecture, and establishing his secure base of operations‚Äîall while continuing his investigation into the tangled relationships between his family, Callahan Industries, and Eidolon Corporation.

As he left the library, Nick's enhanced senses detected the familiar presence of the military-postured observer from his Statistics class, lingering near the entrance, his face hidden behind a newspaper.

The newspaper twitched. Not from wind‚Äîthere wasn't any. Nick didn't look directly at the observer, but he felt the man's attention lock onto him like a pressure behind the eyes. His breathing changed, syncing with Nick's pace. A calculated rhythm.

With his mana-enhanced perception, Nick could detect the observer's electromagnetic signature‚Äîcontrolled, disciplined, but with undercurrents of anticipation. Not just passive surveillance anymore; this was active tracking.

*They're not just watching me anymore,* Nick thought.

*They're waiting for me to move.*

The blue energy beneath his skin pulsed in response to the perceived threat, ready to manifest if needed. Nick maintained his casual pace, giving no indication he'd noticed the surveillance. The watchers were growing bolder, their presence more overt. Time was becoming a critical factor, and Nick couldn't shake the feeling that events were accelerating toward some predetermined confrontation.

As he walked across the quad toward his Calculus class, Nick felt the weight of invisible eyes tracking his every move. Between Callahan's surveillance, Eidolon's mysterious interest, and whatever secrets still lay buried in his family's past, the web around him was tightening.

I went upstairs to a weird room where I saw a ghost, dressed like a priest.

(possibly worth mentioning? My grandpa and his dad were both priests/ministers)

Then I went downstairs to where the congregation was having coffee and sweets after the service. I sat next to my (IRL, deceased) great grandmother. I told her what happened with the ghost upstairs and she reached into her purse and handed me a piece of paper. It was a program for a funeral- her mother‚Äôs funeral.

We have had a BBE for five years that has just conked out and I have now gotten lost down the rabbit hole of trying to figure out the best set up to replace it and would love some advice!

Here is what we are looking for:

We need something that can take heavy use as both of us work from home. I drink 1-2 lattes a day but my DH drinks americanos and espressos throughout the day. So we only need an electric grinder that does espressos.

Up until now, our only experience has been with the BBE. We want convienience and are not serious hobbiests so we don't want it to take forever to brew our drink and are not into taking the time to endlessly tinker but want to have a consistent delicious cup as well as the milk drinks.

We like Lavazza beans and we go through them fairly efficiently so having a hopper is fine and we don't switch coffee blends just buy bags of lavazza.

So bearing all this in mind, does it make sense to get a Bambino Plus and a good grinder? Or are there better machine options based on our usage needs? We are U.S based.

I (27 F) have been at my current job for 4 years, and for the last year and a half I have sat in the same office as my coworker I'll call Tammy (36 F).  She and I have become friends and I even helped her plan parts of her wedding this past year.  When my wedding came around recently, naturally I wanted her to be involved too.  I did not choose her to be a bridesmaid (and she was totally fine with this), but she was there when I picked out my dress and was invited to my bridal shower and bachelorette party in addition to the wedding.  

At the bridal shower, I found out that unfortunately my two maids of honor (childhood friends that are sisters) would not be able to attend the bachelorette weekend due to school.  I was disappointed but completely understood, and they said they would still be planning the bachelorette with the other bridesmaids that would be able to go (8 other people).  When I came back to work after the bridal shower, Tammy told me that she would be planning the bachelorette now because the maids of honor had asked for help.  I was confused with the choice because she is not a bridesmaid and my maids of honor actually knew some of my bridesmaids before this, but I was very grateful for her help and knew that she would do a good job because she is a very organized person.  I told everyone that I did not want to know anything about the bachelorette since it is very rare that I get to be surprised, and that I trusted them completely with putting together a great weekend for everyone.  Over the course of planning Tammy would ask me planning questions that wouldn't spoil anything, and I was totally fine with this.  What irked me a little bit was she would keep talking about the planning group chat that I wasn't in and complain about my other friends.  Things like ""this person is taking forever to respond"", ""your friends are not good planners"", and ""I hate trying to organize females"".  I didn't want to say anything to her because she was planning basically the entire trip for me so I just let it go.  

The bachelorette weekend came and I was excited but a little worried.  Tammy is about 10 years older than me and my other friends, has a bit of a wild side, and can a bit blunt and explosive, even at work.  My friends and myself are nothing like that (we are all people pleasers who hate conflict) so I was worried how everyone would get along.  On the car ride up with two of my bridesmaids, I asked them what they thought of someone who was not a bridesmaid planning the trip.  They said that they were under the impression that she volunteered for the position and that she did a good job putting everything together, but could be slightly controlling at times.  Over the course of the bachelorette weekend I had a great time with my friends.  We got to stay up late talking about our favorite memories, went to a nice dinner and casino, and went ziplining.  Tammy truly did a fantastic job planning everything, every detail was thought of and she made sure I had a good time.  It was slightly odd though because there would be times where everyone else was chatting and gathered together, but she would be off by herself either working in the kitchen or cleaning something up.  Obviously I was very grateful for this and felt bad that she was not joining the group, but all of my other friends would ask if she needed any help and she politely turned them down.  I can't fully explain it but I just started to feel uneasy around her throughout the weekend.  She would make playful comments that my friends and I were so young and immature and that she felt like an old lady in comparison.  We were playing a funny game where you have to find a connection between two words and a judge would pick the best answer.  One round when she was the judge the two words were ""the patriarchy"" and ""spiders"", and myself and many of my friends connected them with ""should be crushed"".  Tammy looked at all our cards and said ""well I don't think either of those things should be crushed"", which for a room full of women was very awkward.  She would also say to everyone several times that she doesn't normally enjoy hanging out with so many females.  I tried my best to ignore this and focus on my other friends since I don't get to see them very often, especially not all together.  

On the last day of the bachelorette weekend, our plan was to check out of our airbnb and make our way over to the ziplining place so we could get there for our scheduled time.  Most girls wanted to get coffee, so they made plans to head out before going to the zipline.  I am not a coffee drinker, but my two college friends said they wanted to head to the zipline early to get sweatshirts from the gift shop since it was colder than expected.  Since I assumed that everyone else was getting coffee, I was happy to spend more time with them.  On our drive to the gift shop, Tammy called me and asked me where we were.  I did not realize that she and a couple other people were not getting coffee and were still at the airbnb.  I told her our plans and that we would meet everyone at the time we agreed upon.  We get to the zipline right on time and meet the rest of the group.  Tammy looks upset and says ""you're late"".  I was confused and said that we had arrived right on time, but she said that everyone else had been waiting on the three of us for 15 minutes so we were late.  I apologized for holding everyone up and we all walked over to the zipline.  There was some sort of issue with our ticket, so since they were under Tammy's name she had to go over to the customer service desk to figure out what was going on.  She is obviously and understandably frustrated and called me over to ask me a question about the zipline, and after I answered she said there was a communication issue.  I assumed she was still talking about the zipline and agreed, but then she says ""no I mean with your friends"".  I asked her to explain what she meant and she said that my college friends were being rude and exclusionary for asking me to go off on our own without asking anyone else, that they were not taking the group into consideration.  I was shocked that she would say something like that to me, but I apologized and said that we all thought everyone else was grabbing coffee.  I also said that we should have definitely double checked if anyone else wanted to go with us before leaving the airbnb, we did not mean to make anyone feel left out.  Tammy then says that one of my bridesmaids that was left behind was especially hurt and felt really excluded.  I never want to make anyone feel that way, especially one of my best friends, so I felt super guilty.  Tammy said she does not blame me since I did not know the plan, but said that my college friends need to check their manners.  I was upset but it was our time for the zipline so I had to move on.     

We all finish ziplining and say goodbye to each other in the parking lot before everyone heads home.  It was such a great feeling to have all my friends in the same place and I was overwhelmed with how grateful I was to have such wonderful people in my life.  I get in Tammy's car so she can drive me home, and she immediately says, ""ugh finally, I don't have to deal with all of those females anymore"".  My mood is instantly brought down and I truly have no idea how to respond.  She does go on to compliment most of my bridesmaids, but continues to call my college friends bratty mean girls.  I know this is not actually their characters so I acknowledge that maybe they did not make the best decision, but do my best to defend them.  Tammy does not budge and I just thank her for all her efforts during the weekend and change the topic.

I reluctantly go to work the next morning because I am nervous about what else Tammy will say about my friends and the weekend.  She continues to shit talk my college friends, says ""you're lucky I didn't kill anyone this weekend"", and ""I could do without some of those girls there this weekend, but that's why they're your friends and not mine"".  I'm very frustrated at this point and decide to just keep my head down since I am not a confrontational person at all and trying to defend my friends before was just a waste.  Tammy notices a shift in my mood and instantly says, ""what's wrong, are you annoyed at me?"".  I tell her I'm not and that I'm just tired.  I don't feel comfortable addressing it truthfully because I don't fully understand my feelings towards her in the moment and if I'm going to have an uncomfortable conversation I'd rather be sure in myself and know what I want to say.

For the next couple of weeks I decide to distance myself from Tammy as much as I can (which is hard sitting in the same office).  I'm still cordial of course, but I try to keep conversations short and not share as much about myself, especially about my wedding.  For example, Tammy very kindly offered to help set up decorations the morning of my wedding since that is an extra charge from the venue if staff sets them up.  I said I really appreciated her offer but the groomsmen were planning on doing decorations and the venue doesn't allow guests onsite until later anyways.  One day, two weeks after the bachelorette party, Tammy gets up from her desk and slams our office door shut out of the blue.  She looks very upset and is crying and says ""I can't do this anymore, what is your problem?  You have been acting so weird since the bachelorette party and I need to know why"".  My heart instantly drops into my stomach and I know I'm in for it.  I try to calmly explain to her that I did not appreciate the way she spoke about my friends after the bachelorette party.  She calls me a liar since I denied that anything was wrong earlier.  She also says that I needed to know that my college friends were not being good people, and that they actually did other things that weekend that pissed her off, including claiming a bed before everyone else when Tammy had asked them to wait.  I agreed that they should have waited, but that I don't want to hear unpleasant things about my friends when it's my bachelorette and Tammy and them will never have to interact again.  She got super offended and said that I was just taking their side because I've known them longer and that I wasn't caring about her at all.  I said I did care about her, it was just jarring to go from such a high being with my friends to such a low hearing them being shit on as soon as I got in the car.  She apologized for telling me in the car but said she needed to tell me at some point that my friends were being bitches.  Tammy then says that she felt so left out the entire weekend, she was so much older than everyone, everyone was going down memory lane when she had nothing to add, and that she felt like she was just the maid for me and my bridesmaids the whole weekend and just felt underappreciated.  I said I was sorry she felt that way because that sucks and she did a great job planning, but that I can't regret talking about old times with friends, I can't help her age, and that multiple people offered to help her but she turned them down.  She responds by saying she doesn't even know why I invited her or why she was there, she didn't feel like she fit in at all and doesn't even know why she's going to my wedding.  I said that I invited her because she's my friend and that while I would like her to be a guest at my wedding, I want her to do what's best for her.  She then says that I've made it very clear that she's ""just a guest"" and that there's my bridesmaids and then there's her.  I ask her to clarify and she references the conversation about setting up for the wedding where I said guests aren't allowed onsite until later.  I said that's true and she is technically a guest since she's not a bridesmaid.  Then I ask if she wanted to be a bridesmaid and she said ""well no"".  Tammy then asks if I even want to be friends anymore.  After everything I really don't know if I want to, but we have to sit together every single day so I just say yes to protect my sanity.  I'm so confused and exhausted at this point that I just break down crying saying that I don't know how to move forward and I just hate conflict/confrontation.  She then switches her mood completely and kindly says that it's not good to bottle things up inside and it's better to just face problems head on rather than sit in anxiety.  The rest of our conversation is basically the two of us discussing why I have an aversion to conflict and Tammy telling me why I should just be more honest with people.  We walked away on better terms and I do agree it was a good idea to have a discussion to clear the air between us.  I still felt off though because I came away feeling like I was crazy for even thinking she did anything wrong and I ended up apologizing more than her. 

I still have that weird feeling about Tammy a couple weeks later at my wedding.  I spent the whole day enjoying my time with my closest family and friends and said hi to Tammy very briefly.  I realized that I felt such a weight off of my shoulders when I was just surrounded by my bridesmaids.  I didn't feel like I needed to walk on eggshells or be ready to defend myself or my friends at any moment.  After discussing this situation and my feelings with my bridesmaids (except my friends from college because I know they are good people who made a mistake and they don't need to be dragged into it), they all agreed that Tammy was acting very strangely.  My bridesmaids said that her comments about ""females"" during the bachelorette trip made them uncomfortable too.  The one bridesmaid who did not get coffee or go to the gift shop that Tammy said felt very left out revealed to me that she was more confused of the plan rather that left out.  She goes on further to say that Tammy was actually the one who was super upset to get left behind.  This made me question other things Tammy had told me, so I asked my maids of honor if they had actually asked Tammy to take over planning for the bachelorette trip.  They said that they did not and that Tammy had actually volunteered to plan everything, and while communicating with them she was a little controlling.  With all this in mind, I decided that my gut was telling me that my friendship with Tammy was not good for me and I needed to distance myself again.

I tried to go back to interacting with Tammy as little as possible hoping I would feel better, but I knew she could tell I was acting weird again.  I was getting so anxious that I could no longer focus on my work, couldn't get things done at home, and was having trouble sleeping.  I hit a breaking point and after talking to my husband, therapist, and boss about the situation, they all agreed the best course of action for me was to move to a desk out of our shared office.  I decided today that I would let Tammy know that I was moving out.  When I told her and she asked why, I tried to be as honest but kind as possible and say that I did not like the way our long conversation/confrontation about the bachelorette party went and that I feel uncomfortable staying in our office because of the way my feelings are getting in the way of my job.  She got understandably upset and starts saying that I don't really care about her or her feelings and that I'm just running away from my problems.  She also says that the bachelorette party put a lot of stress on her and that it was very hard for her to go to my wedding.  I emphasize that I do care about and respect her and appreciate all of her efforts, this is just a boundary I need to set for myself.  And I understand that it may cause tension between us, but I would like to continue having a good working relationship.  Tammy asks if this means I don't want to be friends anymore and I say yes, I don't think for me personally that we are compatible anymore.  She says that I can't expect us to not be friends but not have tension at work, and wants to know why we aren't compatible.  I explain the divide I feel between her and the rest of my friends and she agrees that she is different, but different doesn't necessarily mean bad.  She says she appreciates my honesty, but I am not actually solving anything by changing where I sit, I am just being anxious somewhere else because she and I never got the chance to talk things through.  I said I can understand that logic, but I am trying to do what my gut says is best for me.  She says that from her perspective any problem can be solved with time and communication, and that she just wants me to tell her if I have a problem with her rather than avoiding it and moving on.  I admit that I probably should have at least tried to talk through our awkwardness first before making the decision to move my desk, but this is my first work conflict in my career and it's a very tough circumstance to navigate while being professional and kind.  She was respectful and said that I am obviously free to move if I want to and that she never wants to make me uncomfortable so I can always come to her if I ever feel that way.  The rest of our conversation again evolves into a sort of therapy session where she kindly explains that just because you are different than someone or disagree about something does not mean you should just drop them as friends.  That each person is a life lesson and sometimes it's good for friendships to have conflict because you can gain a greater understanding of each other.  I thought she actually had some good insights and we walked away feeling better and I decided to stay at my current desk for now.

Where I am really struggling is I felt good about our conversation at the end, but again I went from feeling sure I was making the right decision by moving where I sit to feeling dumb for even thinking that was a good idea.  Even writing this post I am worried that I am misrepresenting her or myself in some way.  AITA for having these uneasy feelings towards Tammy and asking to move?  How should I move forward with our work relationship?

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/Gxxr6ls1O7): **June 8, 2025**

My sister has her friends over all the time and they are always throwing their friend parties here because we have a big backyard and her friends like our family. One of her friends katie has a crush on.

She's made it obvious and told my sister about it. She's had flirted with me in the past, but I stopped myself from letting it become anything.

The last time before I saw her she came to my bedroom in the middle of the night at like 2 in the morning when my sister was asleep asking to use my bathroom. I told her there was one in the halkway, but ultimately just let her in.

She tried sleeping with me that time, but I didn't do it. A couple days ago we had another party for my sisters birthday and a similar thing happened. I talked with my sisters birthday beforehand and she said she didn't care as long as I wasn't playing with her feelings and as long as it didnt cause us problems.

So this last time she kept giving me that look like she wanted to be with me and I finakky approached her and talked to her. We had some drinks together, but we weren't drunk and she asked me to dance with her. When we were all going to sleep I invited her to come relax in my bedroom and she got excited and we went back to my room.

We ended up having sex for a long while and we went at it nonstop. I know the sex was good because I got her off a couple times and she definitely enjoyed herself and I tried my best to make sure I satisfied her first.

I had a lot of fun either way her and she slept on top of me. The next day she was with my sister when I woke up and she seems to like be shy around me now. She's acting differet and not as confident as she used to, how do I fix this? I really don't know what caused her to act like this.

Edit: I posted an update on my profile and a couple more things have happened since we met up to talk.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** maybe you were a conquest situation where she just wanted to experience it once or maybe she is just shy now because she did the deed. chicks can be complicated

> **OOP:** I hope that‚Äôs not the case, I ended up liking her and I definitely had a good time with her after giving her a chance. I need to find a way to talk with her once my sister is gone.

**Commenter 2:** She probably feels vulnerable, insecure and wonders if you like her. You make it right by texting her that you had an amazing time and ask if she‚Äôd like to have coffee, a meal or spend an afternoon together doing something you think she would like.

> **OOP:** I hope she doesnt think that I put in a lot of effort to satisfy her, but yeah I‚Äôll try to see if she‚Äôll give me the chance to talk.

**Commenter 3:** Communication is always best. Talk to her, ask why she seems off now. Maybe you need to have a talk about where this is going, and if you are looking for a relationship and all that. From my POV she might be uncertain about the situation.

> **OOP:** Would it be weird if I just ask her to give me a chance as actual partners?

**Commenter 4:** I guess I'm curious of why wait until tomorrow? She could be in her head that whole time and seems like you like her. If I were her I'd personally love a follow up call or text sooner rather than waiting.

> **OOP:** Honestly i think it‚Äôs mostly because I am nervous! I like her a lot and am scared of her rejecting me if I propose something more serious.

&nbsp;

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/2xKEbkdJB8): **June 11, 2025 (three days later)**

A couple things have happened since then. I ended up texting her and she replied back instantly. I asked her if we could see each other to talk and she agreed. She asked if I only wanted to be FWB with her, or if I was willing to give her a chance.

I told her I actually enjoyed spending time with her and that I would like to keep seeing her but more seriously. She told me she was acting shy because she had not been with a guy who got her off like that before and she was embarrassed about how she reacted to it. I told her it was okay and that I enjoyed my time with her.

I officially asked her on a date and last night we went out to dinner and went bowling afterwards. It felt so good seeing her happy and she said I shouldn't have waited so long to actually give her a chance. We just have one other thing I need advice on.

My sister doesn't know we went out and she still has no clue about us being a couple now. How can I bring this up with my sister? I really don't know hiw she will react and I really do like her friend/my now girlfriend

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Just turn up together holding hands in front of your sister is the easiest way to tell her.

> **OOP:** Hmmm Idk, I don‚Äôt want her to be super upset and overreact lol.

**Commenter 2:** It depends on your relationship with your sister but you could say something along the lines of, ""you know how your friend has been pursuing me romantically? Well I asked her out on a date and I really enjoyed myself."" But put it in your words not mine.

> **OOP:** She knows her friend was trying to get with me for a while now. She had told me she didn‚Äôt care if I pursued her back as long as I didn‚Äôt hurt her feelings, but the way my sister I know she probably will still be upset.

**Commenter 3:** You let them have that conversation. I think it will come off better hearing it from her friend than her older brother

> **OOP:** That may be better honestly.

**Commenter 4:** ""I took your advice and asked ""blah blah"" out on a date, but I didn't wanna say anything until afterwards. It went well, so i wanted you to know, and I wanted to say thanks. ""

Done and done. She'll be stoked for you. If you guys decide to tell her about the hook up as well, that's up to you.

> **OOP:** I don‚Äôt know if I will tell her about the hookup until later down the line haha. This soon she would probably be mad, but once we get more serious I don't think she will care.

1le7oky,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1le7oky/aita_for_not_telling_my_wife_how_to_clean_our/,AITA for not telling my wife how to clean our house?,"I (32 M) and my wife (37 F) got into an argument that has gotten out of control. Our house has gotten messy over the past week. I was raised in a household with very strict cleaning standards but sometimes with my job (medic firefighter, multiple 24 hour shifts a week) it can get difficult to keep up with. I am the ""majority"" cleaner and tend to do a lot of upkeep through the week with a deep clean once a week by myself. I used to be obsessive about cleaning but have recognized it through therapy, and have gotten better at communicating when I need help

My wife is very busy. Works full time, takes care of the kids (13,11) when I'm on shift, and does school full time online. She doesn't clean often or complete chores (wash the laundry but doesnt fold, does some dishes but not all)

Yesterday, I asked if we could prioritize cleaning the house the next day (today) and she agreed. She worked from 10-3:45. At 7a I started some basic chores, dog walks, laundry,  making coffee etc, while she stayed in bed (I get it, who wants to do chores before going to work?) I ran errands around town but after, started going in on the house

Wife calls asking if we can take 11 year old to do something this afternoon for last day of school and 13 year old to stay at a friend's house. I agree. When wife gets home at 3:45, I'm still breaking bad on the house and folding our last load of laundry. She doesn't help but does neaten her shoes in the closet, so I don't complain. She starts suggesting what to do with 11 year old and I realize by the length of time everything would take, that any more cleaning is off the table for the day. I got a bit frustrated  about this because I didn't get to everything I'd hoped

I asked ""because we couldn't prioritize cleaning today, what day this week would be good"" She says "" Thursday and maybe you could tell me what to clean"".  My response: ""idk, just clean whatever needs cleaning?"" Things start south. She asks what I specifically want cleaned, how long I want to clean for, just a ton of questions

I don't wait for someone to tell me that something needs to be cleaned. You see it, then you clean it and it takes the time it takes ü§∑ I don't even care WHAT she cleans I just wanted us to work together. I tell her ""I don't think I need to micromanage your cleaning or make you a list. That's literally what we do for the kids""

Well, That was absolutely the wrong thing to say because things blew up. So badly that I had to go to the guest room for space and she yelled that I don't love her. I really don't feel wrong for expecting an adult to be able to help without me having to tell them exactly what to do. Maybe I'm missing something? Maybe I should have just made a list for her? I  just wanted help and sometimes having to walk someone through how to do things / what exactly to do, feels more overwhelming than just doing it yourselfüòî

1le7oj5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1le7oj5/aio_dogs_in_stores/,AIO: Dogs in Stores,"The below happened several months ago, and after completely forgetting about it, I suddenly recalled the situation and thought‚Ä¶wtf? Am I crazy, or is this other guy crazy?

I‚Äôm a man in my early 30s living in a major U.S. city where dogs are everywhere. I have a Dalmatian who is vibrant and curious. I sometimes bring her into cafes to get to-go coffee, only in places where people are not also sitting and eating. I‚Äôll occasionally bring her into other stores where they don‚Äôt sell food or clothing (like to the pharmacy). If anyone tells me that they are allergic or afraid of dogs, I always leave, no questions asked. I have some neighbors in my building who are terrified of dogs and I yield the elevator to them. She gets tons of attention from strangers because she‚Äôs a Dalmatian (not a common breed). Dalmatians also have a bad reputation for being aggressive, so people are naturally curious about her looks and personality. 

All this said, the rules in my city are that dogs technically are not allowed in cafes unless they are registered service animals, which mine is not. She‚Äôs well trained, but obviously too curious and interested in people and food to be a service animal. This is a rule that many people break, often in worse ways than me. However, I‚Äôm still breaking the rules when I bring her into stores and try to make sure she‚Äôs on her best behavior. I consider it a minor faux pas, but one I must acknowledge.

I took my dog into a cafe while we were coming home from a walk. Immediately this nice woman (in her 40s) became curious about the dog and was asking all about her. I was making my dog sit with treats as we went through the line to order. The woman commented repeatedly how well trained my dog was. A couple was there who she was friends with, same age as her, and they didn‚Äôt interact with me at this time. The husband had already ordered and the wife went to go pick up the drinks. 

I ordered and waited near the barista counter, continuing to talk to the woman I had met. I noticed that my dog was getting too close to the woman from the couple I mentioned earlier (who were friends with the woman I was talking to). I live alone with my dog and she‚Äôs not used to interacting with women she doesn‚Äôt know, and she sometimes tries to sniff their privates. I saw her about to sniff the woman from the couple, within a few inches, so I called her back to me and she came. The woman I was talking to didn‚Äôt notice. 

The husband of the woman my dog approached came up to me and screamed very loudly, ‚ÄúExcuse me, is that a trained service dog?‚Äù I said no, and the woman I was talking answered, ‚Äúshe‚Äôs not, she‚Äôs just so well trained!‚Äù He cut her off before she was finished talking and yelled, ‚ÄúSo did you not see the sign on the front door about service dogs, OR DO YOU JUST THINK THE RULES DON‚ÄôT APPLY TO YOU?‚Äù Literally screaming. The cafe was small and crowded, so everyone heard and immediately the whole cafe became completely silent. I was stunned and didn‚Äôt know why the man suddenly became upset. I widened my eyes like ‚Äúokay then‚Ä¶‚Äù and turned away. He said something else, I don‚Äôt remember what, and I responded ‚Äúwe‚Äôre leaving right after I get my drink...‚Äù He got his coffee and passed in front of me to throw away something, and said loudly (within earshot of others!!), ‚Äúwhere I draw the line is where your dog gets too close to my wife‚Äôs BUSINESS,‚Äù referencing that my dog had approached her to sniff. He didn‚Äôt look me in the eye. 

His friend (who I met before this) looked absolutely mortified and immediately left. The wife and several people around me heard what he had just said. The wife said nothing and left. I said ‚Äúsorry about that‚Ä¶‚Äù trying to look him in the eye to show I was earnest, but I was also incredulous how ludicrously he handled that confrontation. What an absolute psycho! He left, I got my drink, and I sat outside. The couple got in their car and drove away - I couldn‚Äôt tell how the wife was feeling about it - and their friend got into her car and when our eyes met she looked down and then drove away. As soon as they left, a dozen different people stopped by us while we sat outside and told me that my dog was so beautiful, so well behaved, asked me where I got her, was she Dalmatian, etc.

I know that I technically shouldn‚Äôt have had the dog in there, but I thought the man COMPLETELY overreacted and embarrassed himself and his wife by extension (especially with the ‚Äúmy wife‚Äôs business‚Äù comment while people were within earshot, their friend no less!). If my dog got too close for comfort, he was totally within his right to say something, but if it were me, I would‚Äôve approached the other person and just asked them to keep their dog closer. You don‚Äôt know if people or their animals are aggressive - why make such a scene in an enclosed space? My impression was that people like him are just such psychopaths that they can‚Äôt be reasoned with. If we were outside or elsewhere that was dog friendly, I would‚Äôve been really pissed at him and yelled back. In this situation, I just tried to remain calm until he left. If we got louder or more aggressive, I do think my dog would‚Äôve become uncomfortable and maybe even tried to defend me by barking at him until he backed away, so I wanted to diffuse the situation.

My questions are: 
1. AIO for feeling like that guy was a complete dick?
2. Was HE overreacting to me?
3. Is misogyny so ingrained in our society that men need to defend their woman‚Äôs honor against‚Ä¶literal animals? I‚Äôm gay so I just have a different relationship with both men and women, and completely don‚Äôt understand if this is a normal behavior for heterosexual couples. I think it isn‚Äôt? 
4. Was the woman likely even upset about my dog being too close to her? I couldn‚Äôt even tell if she noticed my dog at all. I surveyed several girl friends and they all said ‚Äúshe‚Äôs a dog‚Ä¶‚Äù or even ‚Äúdogs just sniff you when you‚Äôre a woman. It‚Äôs happened to me a lot.‚Äù Keep in mind, she wasn‚Äôt actually touching the woman. 
5. I know everyone‚Äôs different, but do women like being married to men like that? Would women view his behavior as defending them?? All I thought about after he left was how insufferable he must be to be married to. I think his behavior was actually inconsiderate of his wife by embarrassing her, under the guise of being a protective husband who‚Äôs actually just a toxic bully. I asked the same girl friends above how they‚Äôd feel if their husband did that, and they all said they‚Äôd be beyond pissed off at him. But then I thought, in this trad wife era, maybe she‚Äôll go home, bake muffins, and thank her husband for keeping her safe from my Dalmatian, after her husband told the whole cafe about her chacha‚Ä¶ she was a bit of a mystery!
6. I‚Äôm obviously gay but also obviously muscular and fit. I had a winter coat on though. The man was probably 10 years older than me (early 40s) and taller. If I were taller than him or more ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù would he have reacted the same way? Or was this his destiny no matter what?
6. Do you have a dog and if so, do you bring them into cafe‚Äôs that are not sit-down restaurants to order to-go?

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/s/Nnd1cWsVmC): **June 10, 2025**

I (27F) have been with my husband (27M) for almost 8 years, married for 3. Let‚Äôs call him Liam (fake name). 

Prior to our relationship, Liam was with Danielle (28F, also fake name). Liam and Danielle met in high school and were extremely close friends before they decided to start dating. They dated from the end of their senior year of high school to the end of their freshman year of college. They were a lot of firsts for each other, including sex for the first time. According to Liam, Danielle was the first girl he was ever truly in love with. He did anything for her, including driving over 2 1/2 hours to and from his college to her college every weekend their freshman year (they went to schools in different states) so they could spend time together. 

Things started to change for them during the later parts of their freshman year of college after Danielle got heavily involved with a religious group on her campus. According to Liam, she got very manipulative and emotionally abusive. She had these new ideas in her head of who she was wanting him to be and wanting to ‚Äúsave him‚Äù. He tried going to church with her and doing the things she wanted him to do but it eventually led to him becoming confused, upset, and ultimately resentful which led to them ending things in a crash and burn type way.

Fast forward several months after they breakup, Liam meets me. We started casually dating at first since he still had trauma and large amounts of trust issues that remained from his relationship with Danielle. After about 5 ish months, he felt like he was ready for something serious again. 3 1/2 years later, we‚Äôre engaged. Another year goes by, we‚Äôre married. Almost 3 years later, we‚Äôre here today. Throughout all of this time, Liam has not heard from Danielle once. Also during this time, Danielle has met someone new, gotten married as well, and currently has a young child.

Flash to a week and a half ago. Liam and I just moved to a new house closer to our hometowns and posted about the move on social media. After seeing the post, Danielle decides to message Liam congratulating us on the new place and hoping that all is well. Nothing too crazy but not something that he was expecting. They begin briefly conversing about house things, moving, renovations, etc. Liam tells me she reached out to him and I find this a bit odd but nothing to worry about. A couple of days later, Liam sits me down to ask me something and for me to ‚Äúnot freak out‚Äù. I, of course, begin freaking out. 

Apparently, Danielle had continued to message him after their brief conversation and eventually sent him a long post letting him know that there are some things she wants to get out in the open, wants to deeply apologize for the way she treated him towards the end of the relationship, and wants to do all of this in person with him. He asks me my opinion on this and I‚Äôm definitely concerned as to why after all this time this is something she feels the need to do and also why the need for this to be in person. After discussing this with a friend who had a similar thing happen to her and afterwards the ex left them alone, I ultimately agreed hoping that the same scenario would play out with us. Boy was I wrong.

Liam and Danielle decide to meet at a coffee shop in a town about halfway between where we live and where she and her husband live. For Liam, it was about an hour drive. This meeting took place this past Saturday. At first, I asked to come with and just sit in the car while they talked since I anticipated it being a short but awkward conversation where she could express what she needed to and then he could leave and we could go do something afterwards. Liam convinced me I would end up being bored and he would feel bad leaving me alone for that time so it was better for me to just stay back. He didn‚Äôt think it would last very long, maybe an hour or so, and he would be home before I knew it. I ended up agreeing and he left early in the morning so he could meet her around 10. After letting me know once he got there and that he would keep me posted on when he would be heading back, I waited. After about an hour, I texted asking how it was going and he said it was fine and that he was just listening to what she had to say. 

Another hour goes by and I start feeling a bit concerned as I would have thought they would be done by now. Another hour goes by and I‚Äôm full on irritated. I text him saying it‚Äôs been three hours and ask when I should expect him back. He lets me know they‚Äôre catching up and he would let me know. ANOTHER hour goes by. Four hours in total and I‚Äôm mad. What was supposed to be a short apology conversation was turning into a full day thing. Finally, he lets me know he‚Äôs heading home after 4 1/2 hours of them talking. I needed answers.

When he finally got home, I asked what happened. He lets me know that Danielle did apologize for the way she treated him during their relationship. After that, they began catching each other up on their lives since it had been nearly 8 years since they last talked. It was a good, casual conversation and then she started breaking down crying. According to Liam, Danielle is at her wits end in her marriage is considering divorcing her husband. She told Liam that her husband hasn‚Äôt been the man she thought he would be and that they have lost all passion in their marriage. That it got harder after she had their baby and doesn‚Äôt know what to do since she doesn‚Äôt really like the idea of starting over and navigating as a single mom. 

Basically, she was confiding in him about all of the issues in her life and he sat and listened and talked with her. Liam said she really just needed someone to listen that wasn‚Äôt involved in their circle. He felt bad for her and just wants to make sure she is okay. He then asked me how I would feel if they continued to be casual acquaintances. I told him I could maybe get to a point where I would be comfortable with that, but would needed to think about it.

He made it seem like that was the end of what they discussed and we continued the rest of our day as normal. At the end of the day, we get in bed and are watching TV when I notice that he‚Äôs getting quiet and distant. I ask what is wrong and he starts to tear up saying that there was more he needed to tell me about him and Danielle‚Äôs conversation. I, immediately, get worried. In tears, he tells me that Danielle expressed to him that she still has feelings for him. Even though it‚Äôs been years and they‚Äôve both moved on, she still has parts of her heart set for him. That her husband ‚Äúisn‚Äôt half the man he is‚Äù. 

In some ways, I wasn‚Äôt shocked to hear that especially since she wanted to meet with him after all this time. However, what he said next did shock me. He told me that after talking with her, he realized that he also still has some unresolved feelings for her. All this time, he thought she hated him after they broke up when in reality she was just struggling with her religious trauma in college and took things out on him when she shouldn‚Äôt. Everything was took out of context. I didn‚Äôt know what to think. He was so hurt and torn apart after they broke up and it took me months to build his trust and hope back up in the beginning to allow him to see himself capable of love again. Now all these years later he says he still has a part of his heart for her. In many ways, I understand because first love will always hold a spot. But I‚Äôm also a bit hurt that my husband, the man I plan to spend the rest of my life with, still feels for his ex.

After learning that she still has feelings for him, I told him I wasn‚Äôt liking the idea of them still talking. That she could eventually start interpreting his kindness to her wrongly and see some sort of potential between them. That really she should be discussing her marital issues with her own husband and not him. He insists that she would never come between us and that Danielle herself even expressed that she respected the idea of marriage whole heartedly and the last thing she would want to do is harm ours. He wants to be there for her because it seems like she doesn‚Äôt really have anyone else to talk to about all of this.

Last night, he was showing me TikToks on his phone when a text notification from Danielle popped up. I questioned him about it and he shrugged it off as nothing. Today, I asked if she was still texting him and he said she was but he was trying to slowly cut her off. I expressed again how I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs best for him to be talking to her and how she really should be going to a friend or family member to talk about her issues. I noticed he was still texting her throughout the evening tonight too.

Should I be concerned about all of this? I don‚Äôt want to come across as a wife who controls who her husband can or cannot talk to. I do trust my husband but I don‚Äôt really know Danielle. He insists she is true to her word and would never try anything but how can I know for sure? My best friends think I should tell him to block her. I don‚Äôt think he will because he feels bad for her. But I don‚Äôt want her to continuing to reach out to him for validation and that eventually leading to her feelings towards him growing more. What do I do? Please help.

TLDR: My husband‚Äôs ex girlfriend reached out to him after almost 8 years to apologize for the way she treated him. They spent time together catching up and she told him about how her own marriage is falling apart and doesn‚Äôt really know what to do. She‚Äôs been confiding in him for a few days now. Learned that there is also unresolved feelings on her end and my husbands end. Told my husband I didn‚Äôt like the idea of her coming to him for validation especially if she has feelings. He says she would never try anything. They are continuing to talk. Should I be concerned?

**Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Tell your husband that his ex‚Äôs failing marriage is her own problem.

""Unless you want your own marriage to fail too, you better stop this nonsense"".

**Commenter 2:** Yes you should be concerned. If your husband values your peace and respect you then they need to cut ties. Tell him you don‚Äôt trust her and you don‚Äôt trust your husband‚Äôs feelings (since she was his first love).

**Commenter 3:** ""Danielle would never do that"" she already did.

Why confess her feelings to a married man? Why she even appear again?

**Commenter 4:** He is treating you as a placeholder.

As soon as she crooks your little finger he comes running?

I suggest you have a brutally honest conversation with him. Stop trying to figure out if you are wrong or right. You feel how you feel. You are not wrong in feeling the way you feel.

To be honest, if my partner said this to me I would tell him I'm not a placeholder, and if he has feelings for her it means that he doesn't love and honor me. He allowed some other woman to confess feelings for him and didn't shut it down hard. He is already cheating on you emotionally by not cutting it out and blocking her.

Start getting yourself together. He is entertaining her and building a connection with her.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/s/UOPVpXhfgi): **June 11, 2025 (next day)**

I want to thank everyone who saw my original post and left a comment or sent me a message. Although they may have been difficult for me to read through, it was something I ultimately needed to do.

Anyways, here is the update.

Liam (27M, husband, fake name) has been at work all day so I wasn't able to talk to him much until he got home. I sat him down again and let him know that I needed to talk about him about his communication with Danielle (28F, husband's ex, fake name). I told him that I wasn't happy and that I needed to know if he was still talking to Danielle today. He told me he was, but that he was to finally end things with her. 

For those of you (if not all of you) that suggested Danielle reached out to him because she wanted him for herself, you were correct!! Liam called her today and she straight up asked him how happy he was with me and that if for even a second there were issues and wanted out that they could run away together. She wants to divorce her husband and be with him. I believe this admittance finally broke Liam's rose colored glasses on the situation and opened him up to seeing what she was really doing. Trying to manipulate her way back to him and home wreck our marriage. 

He finally told her enough is enough and that he cannot talk to her anymore. That he did feel sorry for everything going on with her and her own marriage but for the sake of his own marriage and his love for me that he needs to stop being in touch with her. He realized that those unresolved feelings that he started to have for her after meeting with her this past Saturday were more like feelings of nostalgia for the times they spent together and the times they were happy. 

The ways she spoke about him and his character made him feel good and gave him that ego boost but after hearing her true intentions, he was able to remember the way she was before and why they broke up in the first place. I told him I wanted him to block her. I wanted no contact at all with her and he agreed. So he deleted all of their messages, blocked her number, and blocked all of her social media right in front of me. There will be no communication between them going forward.

Again, thank you all so much for the help realizing what was happening and what needed to be done. I really appreciate it.

**Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Yes finally a good update. Thankfully he got his head out of his behind and realized what she was doing. Good luck to you in the future.

**Commenter 2:** OP that‚Äôs great BUT trust me when I say you have to inspect what you expect. Don‚Äôt just blindly take his word for it. He could probably tell you were done if he didn‚Äôt agree so he took steps. All of those could be undone just as fast. Give it a day, maybe two and then without fanfare ask him for his phone. Tell him you just want to see for your own mental health that she is still blocked and there has been no communication because you don‚Äôt believe she will go that easily. Don‚Äôt let him say no or leave the room. Tell him to unlock it and let you see it. Check every single app he has on his phone that offers messaging‚Ä¶texts, Facebook messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, Snapchat‚Ä¶every single app. Look at recently deleted folders.

Also you still need to contact her husband and alert him. Don‚Äôt tell your husband you‚Äôre going to. Just do it. He deserves to know. Her marriage may be a wreck but cheaters say that ALL the time. You would want him to call you. If she is that miserable he needs to know.

**Commenter 3:** I saw your previous post, when Danielle said she respected your marriage...yes, to the point of wrecking your marriage...I m glad he blocked but don't celebrate too fast...they might keep communicating on other platforms...keep your eyes open, because I'm afraid this is not over yet...

Also, your husband may want to contact hers, as I suspect he's not aware of his wife's shenanigans

**Commenter 4:** I still recommend him reading the book Not Just Friends by Shirley Glass, it‚Äôs about emotional infidelity. There are huge signs that this woman was giving that he wasn‚Äôt picking up on and that is concerning. Being cognizant of a woman purposefully perusing you is important in any marriage that wants to last.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BoomersBeingFools/s/aEAQqKE1BB)  **May 22, 2025**

I just need to vent... 

My son's high school graduation was earlier this week. I had invited my parents (both late 70s) at the beginning of the year. They kept seesawing on coming or not coming. They eventually agreed to come like 3 weeks before graduation, which ok, cool. (They had to drive in from out of state.) 

Day of, schedule was pretty clear to them. Ceremony starts at X, doors open an hour beforehand. Be there 15 minutes before that because that is when parking opens up. Parking is going to fill up quickly because over 250 kids were graduating, and you know some of these kids had about 7 generations of family showing up. I told them to meet me at the parking garage at the 15 minutes before doors open mark. So what do they do? Leave their hotel (located 25 minutes away) 1 minute before that. 

Got bitched at for not waiting for them. Even though, 15 minutes after the doors opened, it was turning into standing room only. When we realized they weren't going to be here and parked by the time the doors opened, my husband, other kid, and I went to go wait in the line. Which, thank goodness we did because about 5 minutes later, the line was down the street to the next block over. They wanted us to come back out to get them, which was impossible because the sea of people were all pushing one way. Not about to battle an entire army of people to get back out (no other way out either.) We were lucky to get in when we did, to get the seats we did, because by the time my parents texted they arrived, it was turning into standing room being the only thing left. 

My mom then spent the entire first part of the ceremony people watching, with a super judgy face on. Kept telling my other kid that the lady with all the piercings and tattoos probably doesn't have a job, going no where in life, etc etc etc. I shushed her and got ""the look."" (Which no longer effects me since I just spent the last 18 years improving ""the look."") 

Also, for some reason, my son's full middle name didn't get read out (they just said his initial instead.) I don't know why or how it got missed, but I nearly missed getting pictures of my son getting his diploma on stage because she was bitching about it.  Some pictures turned out blurry because she kept smacking my arm. Luckily my husband got some pictures, but like holy fuck. I would have cried if we didn't get some sort of decent picture. 

She snapped at my other kid because we did the whole ""woooo!"" when his name was called. Compared to the other people in the arena, I doubt he even heard us cause it was just me and other kid (husband couldn't because he was trying to line up shots around people walking in front of us and his brain couldn't do two things at once lol.) 

One of the kid speakers (class president, maybe?) was talking about evolution and how we got to the point we were at today, and my mom complained about that. ""They should be thanking God! God got them here!"" Not even a Christian school, Mother. She also complained because some of the young ladies were wearing head scarves (""they let them in this school?"" like Jesus H. Christ on a cracker, it's a fucking public school, Mom. They're still people too, just like you, though probably less of a bitchbag.) 

 Also got comments from her about the kids with green hair, blue hair, purple hair, and one girl with clown clothes on. ""They are going no where in life!"" Like... they just graduated, their life is just starting. Girl with the clown clothes was wearing a bunch of the different graduation cords and had her name in the program with several scholarships listed. Pointedly told my other kid, ""And this is why we don't judge people based on their looks..."" 

They have tried to talk my son out of going to his choice of college. They think it's going to be too far away from me (once we drop him off, we have to move across the country because military orders) and that it is in a bad part of town. They are trying to paint some picture that my son is going to be stabbed, shot, mugged, and left for dead. (City the school is in has some crime, obviously, but the college itself has released their safety reports and haven't had much issues or crime.)

I used her favorite line when I voice a worry: ""It's all up to God."" (I'm not even religious or Christian anymore.) Managed to get ""the look"" again when I said that. 

They are here for the rest of the weekend. We have another promotion ceremony for other kid this weekend (8th grade). So... send help? Think dealing with them have given ME gray hairs. 

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/BoomersBeingFools/s/ySIEAt5ITj)  **June 11, 2025**

Update to Boomer Parents and Graduation

Orginial post can be found here: [Boomer Parents and Graduation](https://www.reddit.com/r/BoomersBeingFools/comments/1kstctp/boomer_parents_and_graduation/)

I have gotten a few DMs from people wondering if I made it through my parents' visit. I did make it through, but my relationship with my mother did not. We are currently not on speaking terms... well, to be more specific, I am not on speaking terms with her, she has been refusing to accept that. 

The weekend after my post, we had made plans to meet at 10am. They showed up at 8am. Ready to go, with no place to go. They made plans to stay for so long, but made zero plans to fill that time, thinking I would magically come up with something to do. At 8am on a Saturday morning. Like, I can't even think straight due to lack of coffee at this hour (I am not a morning person) and have no idea where my bra is, but sure, I'll pull out something to do from my ass. 

They were just like ""let's just do what you normally would do on a weekend!"" which... no. 1) It'd be physically impossible for them to do, considering my mother probably needed a walker a decade ago, but refuses to use because it ages her... 2) They have no interest in video games or board games. Already tried getting them to play a board game previously and my mom stuck her nose up at that, and 3) Lots to do here, but 95% of the things worth doing is outdoors. My mom cries her head off if it's over 71 degrees outside. It's always ""I'm melting! It's too hot! I'm meeeeelting."" Like she is the Wicked Witch of the (Mid) West. Also, my family and I don't really go out every weekend. We like being home, we like being alone.

So there I was, scouring the internet for things to do with elderly people who can't walk in our area (and still getting hit with ""go hike here or there or over there!"") while wondering if parent day care was thing. Mom was chatting with my husband, when she decided to start talking about her favorite subject: Emma, my stepsister/her stepdaughter. 

The way she gushes about Emma makes you think Emma shits out gold nuggets and pukes up diamonds, emeralds, and rubies, all while having the cure to cancer in her head. When our parents got married, she kept asking me ""Why can't you be more like Emma?"" Like idk mom, maybe because I'm still a teenager while Emma is pushing 30 (at the time.) Naturally Emma was going to be ""more ahead"" in life. But from the day they married until now, I was constantly compared to Emma, told to be like Emma, and occasionally called Emma. When I had a mental breakdown in my early 20s and ended up in the psych ward, I was told to get over it or turn to God. But when Emma had a similar situation, it was all ""she needs all the help she can get!"" Emma marries a shit stain of a man who abused her, and my mom is ready to scorch the world. But when I was dating a guy who turned abusive, it was my fault. 

You get the idea. 

I have no real issue with Emma. Though, it took me quite a bit in therapy to get to the point where I am no longer resenting her. These days we are mainly FB friends, liking each other's random photos. 

So she is gushing to my husband about Emma, I'm only half listening until I hear her say, clear as fucking day, ""Emma is like the daughter I never had."" My husband and her husband went deer-in-headlights shocked. My son (18) said ""wtf."" Took my daughter (14) a few seconds longer to process what she heard, but even she caught it (she's not a morning person either.) I basically just said, ""Well, guess that's that, you can get the fuck out now."" 

Of course, I was hit with the ""what did I do?"" bit. My son repeated what she said, so she started her gaslighting bullshit. ""You took it the wrong way! That's not what I meant!"" Etc. Etc. Etc. I think with the help of those who commented on my last post, I shined up my backbone a little because I just told her to get the fuck out. My husband says I told her ""If you don't have a daughter, then why the fuck do I have some crusty old farts in my house?"" and threatened to throw all her shit out the window. I don't remember saying any of that, but my son backs it up. I don't remember a lot in the few minutes it took to get her tossed out.  

After she finally left my house, I broke down crying and got sick. I don't do confrontation very well...

She keeps trying to call, text, email me. My husband managed to get her blocked on my phone, so at least I don't get bombarded with calls and texts anymore. (First day, before I blocked her, I had over 50 missed calls and 40 text messages from her. She also managed to fill up my voicemail, not that I listened to any of it. Husband deleted all of them for me too.) She only has my old email account, that I use for spam now, so not really seeing those either, though last I looked, over a week ago, there were around 20 emails just from her. Starting to get a few letters in the (snail) mail from her too, so oh joy.

Guess she told some sob story to Emma too because she reached out to me. Luckily, she listened to my side and just told me, ""Good for you."" She also told me she has never been a huge fan of my mom, for reasons like this, but only plays nice and stays civil for her dad's sake. Made me feel a little better knowing that Saint Emma dislikes her too.

I was a mess for about a week after everything happened. Still am a mess, but less so. My husband and kids have been working hard to distract me and I have been keeping up with my therapy sessions every week (she even got me in for an emergency session the next Monday.) Luckily, my summer is about to get busy... Husband is taking a month off, having a garage sale, preparing to move to a new state, getting my son ready for college, so I will have plenty to do to keep my mind off things. 

I did tell my kids they were allowed to have a relationship with either grandma or grandpa, but they were both like, ""nah, they made my mom cry!"" Then they proceeded to kick my ass in Mario Kart.

Context: Me and my Bf bought a motorcycle this year. Mag 5 months pa lang next month (July), I was the one who paid the down payment since it's an installment for atleast 24 months and mas malaki kasi sahod ko kaysa sa bf ko. Ang plano namin ay maghahati kami sa bayarin ng motor every month since ginagamit nya rin yon sa work nya and ako, pag aalis kami. 

Ever since nagkamotor kami yung bf ko na laging naghahatid sa pamilya nya whenever they're going somewhere or run an errands kahit nga sobrang lapit lang na pwede naman lakarin papasundo or hatid pa sa kanya. Kahit pagod sya galing work tas tulog gigisingin pa yan sya. Yung ate nya wala to sa bahay nila kasi after graduation nakipag live in na sya sa partner nya na may motor din. Ang kinakainis ko lagi pa rin nya chinachat bf ko para magpahatid sa ganito sa ganyan or magpasundo pero I keep it to myself pa rin. Minsan din cchat ate nya magrides sila kasama partner nya pero parang di ako kasama sa plano kahit ako namn din nagbabayad sa motor na yon. Para bang ilang sila sakin kaya bf ko na lang magisa sumasama tas ate nya and partner non. 

Kagabi while using my bf's fb acc biglang nagchat yung ate nya she said ""Hindi na magpapahatid yung kaklase ko"" naguluhan ako sa chat ng ate nya kaya chinat ko rin bf ko na anong sinasabi ng ate nya then kinuwento ng bf ko na doon daw malapit sa pinagttrabahuan nya may coffeeshop daw don since malapit lang naman daw yung coffee shop sa work nya pinuntahan daw sya ng ate nya with her former classmate na babae and gusto ng ate nya na ihatid daw ng bf yung classmate nya na yon kasi gabi na raw or walang masakyan pero tumanggi bf ko, nagdahilan sya na wala syang extra helmet. Sa loob loob ko naman wtf? bakit ihahatid yon ng bf ko sa bahay nila eh di naman sya nagpumilit na pumunta yon sa coffee shop?! Also di naman nya kaano ano yon and lastly, Hindi ko kilala yung babae na yon tas gusto nya ihatid yon ng bf ko pauwi??? Sobra talaga kong nainis na lahat yata ng kasalanang ginawa ng ate nya sakin naaalala ko. Dati rin kasi binabanggit nung ate nya yung ex ng bf ko sa harap ko pa and yung parang pinaparamdam nya samin na mas matanda sya samin kaya kung anong iutos nya sa bf ko dapat susundin. 


Previous attempts: Sinabi ko na yan sa bf ko na bakit kaylangan sya pa maghatid don and sabi nya hindi nya rin daw alam. Help me naman guys ano bang pwedeng gawin sa gantong sitwasyon dahil inis na talaga ko sa ate nya HHAHAHA",2,1750219186.0,adviceph,3,1.0,False

I recently started talking to a girl who I am very attracted to. I managed to shoot my shot by writing on a slip of paper to text me and potentially have coffee together. That same day she texted me. I replied back that same day but no response for 4 days pretty much. 

Here is the weird part, just yesterday I didn‚Äôt think I was going to have time to speak to her because I was busy at work and she was busy too but she saw me. She left whatever she was working on at work and walked up to talk to me. We started talking and we were having a great conversation, I was flirting with her, making her laugh, asking me questions, etc. She enjoyed it. I can tell she wasn‚Äôt just being nice to me either but rather she has a good amount of interest in me. One important thing she asked was do I use IG and I said I do, so I sent a text today this morning of my IG account. She hasn‚Äôt added me yet. 

So my question is what‚Äôs going on? Why is she giving me mixed signals and is she testing me or something? I can‚Äôt seem to read her at all. I need help.

***************

My family and I just returned from the beach where we spent a week in an AirBnB with my sister and her family. The condo was a disaster from the word go. Artwork hanging so low the kids could touch it, the dishwasher was broken, every dish/pot/pan we pulled out of the cabinet had food stuck to it and had to be hand washed, we had the exact number of towels as guests so we had to do laundry multiple times a day, the dryer was full of sand, the doorbell didn‚Äôt work, the board games were in a low cabinet with no locks and the first thing the toddler did was dump them all out on the floor so we sorted them back out and stored them on top of the counter and fridge, glass knickknacks were everywhere, we spent the better part of arrival ‚Äúbaby‚Äù proofing the condo‚Ä¶

***The worst part?*** The balcony doors had no safety locks, the front door had no interior locking system  - no deadbolt, no chain, no flip bar (so the children could just open it up and walk right out). When I questioned this I was told, ‚Äúthe listing doesn‚Äôt say there are interior locks.‚Äù Okay, well, it doesn‚Äôt say the TV works either and yet it is supposed to‚Ä¶ AND the fire alarm system was messed up so it kept going off at all hours (once at 3 AM). It took different 3 alarms before we got someone from the management company to fix it which consisted of them removing the smoke detectors and never returning them. While they were there removing the smoke detectors, the property manager showed up with a giant glass tray to put over the top off the coffee table which we had to remove and put in a closet. 

My family left before my sister‚Äôs family so she had the responsibility of final touches. But the reservation is in my name so I am the point of contact. I received a request for $440 for a deep cleaning because we did not follow check out procedures and upholstery needs to be steam cleaned. 

Obviously, we ***WILL*** be paying for the upholstery cleaning because my sister admitted to what her toddler did. 

The checkout instructions say to:

1. take out trash (my sister did leave a pull-up in one trash can, some empty grocery bags/box on the counter along with a banana, and food in the fridge. Since the food was unopened/sealed her rationale was that it was better to leave the food/alcohol for the cleaning crew than to throw it away). 

2. Leave linens on bed.

3. Put towels in bathtub (all the towels were washed, dried, and folded on the shelf above the washer/dryer except for a few that were used for showers this morning which the kids instantly started washing because that had become the routine. So the towels were clean and only needed to be dried). 

4. Run the dishwasher. We loaded it, threw 2 dishwasher tabs in the bottom, and started it (this 1 of the 2 ‚Äúwork arounds‚Äù the management company offered us when we informed them about the dishwasher. The other work around being, ‚Äúwash them by hand‚Äù).

Additionally, board games were left on the counter/on top of the fridge, the floors were not swept, and there was a Gatorade bottle under the bunk beds. 

Because we failed to follow these steps we are being asked to pay an additional $195 in cleaning fees. Plus $245 in upholstery fees (again, my sister admitted to the issue with the upholstery so she ***will*** be sending me the money for that). 

The property manager said they had to bring in 2 additional employees to clean? She sent pictures and I don‚Äôt know how it took a regular cleaning crew plus 2 more. So I have messaged the management company and asked for photos of the cleaned upholstery and a detailed invoice of the services provided directly from the cleaning company. 

Should I push my sister for us to pay the additional cleaning fee? Should we offer half of the additional fee? Or only pay the upholstery fee and not pay the additional cleaning fee?

Ohhh boy, this one‚Äôs gonna be a wild ride. Let‚Äôs take it straight to *The Fallen State* set‚ÄîJesse Lee Peterson across from you, Bobby the Gen-X firestarter, cool as hell but ready to drop napalm truth bombs. Satirical? Absolutely. But we're gonna lace it with enough realness to sting.

**‚ÄúDo Black People Really Create the Hood? | Bobby vs. Jesse Lee Peterson‚Äù**

Set of *The Fallen State*. Faux leather chairs. A fake plant. Jesse‚Äôs mug full of old coffee and hot takes.

**JESSE LEE PETERSON (grinning):**  
‚ÄúSo Bobby‚Ä¶ You from Brockton, right? You notice wherever Black people go‚Ä¶ it turn into the ghetto. Why is that?‚Äù

**BOBBY (leans in, calm but sharp):**  
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs break this down, Jesse. That‚Äôs like saying wherever white people go, it turns into a suburb with a Starbucks and no soul. Correlation ain't causation, my guy. Poverty, redlining, disinvestment, and systemic racism? Those are the architects of the so-called ‚ÄòHood‚Äô‚Äînot melanin.‚Äù

**JESSE:**  
‚ÄúBut Black folks don‚Äôt build! They destroy! Look at Chicago!‚Äù

**BOBBY:**  
‚ÄúBruh, that‚Äôs the Fox News starter pack. You ever been to Chicago? South Side got more culture, resilience, and community than your whole studio. You talking about crime like it‚Äôs a racial trait when it‚Äôs actually tied to generational poverty and abandonment. You blame the symptoms instead of addressing the cause.‚Äù

**JESSE (laughs):**  
‚ÄúYou sound like a beta male social justice warrior.‚Äù

**BOBBY:**  
‚ÄúBetter a beta with a backbone than an alpha who capes for white supremacy. You ever read a history book that wasn‚Äôt written by a Confederate ghostwriter? Like, *The New Deal* excluded Black folks. GI Bill? Redlined. Banks? Denied loans. Meanwhile, Jesse‚Äôs out here blaming single mothers like it‚Äôs Mortal Kombat: Family Court Edition.‚Äù

**JESSE:**  
‚ÄúSo you're saying they victims?‚Äù

**BOBBY:**  
‚ÄúNah. I‚Äôm saying they *survivors*. You don‚Äôt get to tell people who‚Äôve been systematically shut out of opportunity that *they‚Äôre the problem* for making do with what was left behind. You out here saying they ‚Äòmake it a hood‚Äô while ignoring who took the jobs, closed the schools, and dumped crack in the community.‚Äù

**JESSE (defensive):**  
‚ÄúYou believe in systemic racism?‚Äù

**BOBBY:**  
‚ÄúAbsolutely. It ain‚Äôt a belief system, it‚Äôs documented history. But I also believe in Black excellence‚Äîdespite that system. You wanna talk about what Black folks *create*? Jazz, hip hop, civil rights movements, literature, art, soul food, sneaker culture, TikTok trends‚Äî*literally the culture you benefit from while blaming them for America‚Äôs rot.*‚Äù

**JESSE:**  
‚ÄúWhat about the fathers? No fathers in the home.‚Äù

**BOBBY:**  
‚ÄúFair point‚Äîbut incomplete. Wanna know who broke up the Black family? The War on Drugs. Mass incarceration. Welfare laws targeting Black households. Reaganomics. That‚Äôs policy‚Äînot pathology. You point fingers at behavior, I point to the system behind the curtain. You‚Äôre the Wizard of Falsehoods, Jesse.‚Äù

**JESSE (laughs nervously):**  
‚ÄúInteresting... Are you a Christian?‚Äù

**BOBBY (smirks):**  
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just say I try to live more like Jesus than most of his loudest fans.‚Äù

**CLOSING MONOLOGUE (VO with slow zoom-in on Bobby):**

I'm trying to conduct a repair on a coffee scale I snagged for free. 

I'm pretty sure the issue is a faulty load cell (the scale is unable to be calibrated or reset due to the firmware throwing a 'calibration error', but otherwise appears to function fine). I've found what looks to be a suitable, equivalently sized and specced load cell on eBay, but the wires are missing a connector, obviously.

While I'm going to try to de-pin the existing connector, I'm afraid I'll probably break it. If I did, I want to know what the name of this connector is so I can buy a replacement.

The connector plugs into the board vertically and snaps into place. The top left image shows the bottom side of the connector, while the bottom left image shows the top side. The connector's receptacle is highlighted in red in the right image.

The connector appears to be \~5mm wide.

Hopefully this is a relatively common connector? I tried looking at JST/Molex, but in my limited search couldn't find any of their plugs that connected mated vertically quite like this connector does.

Obviously, if my friend DIDNT tell me something this huge, we weren‚Äôt close. But, let me explain.

Me and this friend, I‚Äôll call him Austin for this, met in college. We instantly clicked on so many levels - our humor, our humor experiences with our families and being queer and growing up in a small town, our specific interests. When we met, we were both in relationships, and our relationship was NEVER anything more than friends. Both of our partners knew about the friendship (just to preface in case you think a woman and a man being close friends is odd) We were super close for a whole year of college- we both would‚Äôve said we were one of each others‚Äô best friends. Then, he ended up breaking up with his partner at the time, and getting a new girlfriend near the end of the academic year (who seemed to be, to me, a kind person who had close male friends as well, so she wasn‚Äôt the jealous girlfriend type). Then, our friendship changed. Over the course of months he grew more and more distant- not just to me but to any friends he made on campus that weren‚Äôt his girlfriend or his roommates. We went from seeing each other multiple times a week to slowly less and less. He would often apologize in person and suggest that we hang out more. 

However - things got strange a few months ago. MY partner and I (who he was friends with, but not super close) ended up breaking up. I was dumped - It was a bad breakup and a long story, but he essentially cheated at the end of it. Before Austin knew the details of the breakup, he was hanging out with my ex more than ever, which seemed odd. They had never been close enough to hang out one on one, and suddenly were. I ended up confiding in Austin a few months ago about the details of the breakup, and he said he wanted to stay neutral about it. He believed me but didn‚Äôt want to believe my ex would have done the things he did. I was shocked, since Austin had said so many times on how he prides himself on being a loyal friend and we were so much closer. During this conversation, Austin and I also talked about how his girlfriend might be moving to the coast for school - he said he wouldn‚Äôt move with her. 

Flash forward to months later, and I‚Äôve never heard anything from him since an ‚Äúid love to get coffee sometime soon‚Äù a week after our last conversation. I responded and followed up a week later, but there was nothing. Multiple people at our college came up to me and asked if I had heard from Austin recently, since they knew we were close. No one had heard from him. One of our friends ended up running into him at a grocery store and he told them that he WAS going to be moving away with his girlfriend. He never texted me, never said anything even after I texted AGAIN asking if he was moving away. Nothing. From his girlfriend‚Äôs story on social media, I can see they‚Äôre both on the other side of the country. 

I can‚Äôt believe I will never see him again. More than anything, I‚Äôm shocked that he didn‚Äôt say ANYTHING to me. We didn‚Äôt have a falling out, nothing. It was just radio silence. I miss my friend. I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs long distance, I just want to talk to him again. This isn‚Äôt normal, right??",1,1750217323.0,AmIOverreacting,3,0.67,False

June 15, 2025 ‚Äî 5.45am
Joe Rogan likes to hunt and cook his own food. He shoots with a bow ‚Äì elk, with their wild screams, are his favourite prey ‚Äì then barbecues the meat and serves it thinly cut, with cheese and jalapenos. He uses weed and psychedelics, reads Hunter S. Thompson, and dabbles in stand-up comedy. He‚Äôs a mixed martial arts expert, and nurtures his hard, nuggety physique with gruelling workouts and experimental supplements.

His creed, as he once put it, is to embrace something that‚Äôs terrifying, ‚Äúthat most people shy away from, and you can succeed in life‚Äù.

Rogan is a man‚Äôs man. And many Australian men love him. His meandering, prolific, often-controversial show, The Joe Rogan Experience ‚Äì which was the country‚Äôs most popular podcast last year, and has 50 million-odd downloads a month worldwide ‚Äì has a male listenership, and mostly male guest list. He once said advertisers were surprised at his listener figures. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre like, Jesus Christ,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got, like, 94 per cent men. I‚Äôm like ‚Ä¶ men are not represented.‚Äù
His followers are not just fight fans, gym bros and fellow vaccine sceptics. Highly educated, urbane and politically centrist men listen too. As a Melburnian with multiple degrees tells this masthead, on the condition of anonymity for fear of being picked on by friends and colleagues, ‚ÄúWho wouldn‚Äôt want to be a skilled martial artist with loads of muscles? Would you rather be that guy or be known for being witty or intelligent? Yes, I‚Äôd rather be that guy.‚Äù

Rogan began his podcast 15 years ago, chewing fat with all sorts ‚Äì disruptors, brilliant thinkers, adventurers. His politics was all over the place; a gay marriage and drug legalisation advocate who endorsed Democrat Bernie Sanders.

But his views, while still sprawling across the political firmament, are increasingly fringe. He has come to believe that vaccines are a lie and the mainstream media is corrupt. He is close to members of Trump‚Äôs regime. Celebrity, comedy and MMA guests are intermingled with discredited doctors and far-right commentators.

Some fear his influence is harmful. Teen boys and young men might turn to Rogan for models of manliness, but their lessons from this zealot of ‚Äúhuman optimisation‚Äù (physical and mental self-improvement, complete with testosterone injections and cryotherapy chambers) are accompanied by an uncritical serving of junk science, fringe politics and conspiracy theories. Last year, ABC chair Kim Williams said people like Rogan preyed on vulnerabilities, and ‚Äúall of the elements that contribute to uncertainty in society‚Äù.
But others say he‚Äôs less dangerous than progressives think. Australian podcaster Josh Szeps (formerly of the ABC) is a friend of Rogan‚Äôs, and has appeared on his podcast seven times. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really conflicted about him now,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI believe he has been a negative force on a lot of issues over the past five years. But the existence of someone who is genuinely curious to the point of credulity is on balance a preferable thing to have as an entry point to the world of ideas for young people than a 14-second video on TikTok, given they‚Äôre not going to be reading The New Yorker.‚Äù

Rogan‚Äôs voice can be heard in Sydney boys‚Äô boarding schools, in the luxury cars of chief executives, and in gardens of home-builders as they chip away at DIY renovations. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs smart, and has interesting guests,‚Äù says one lawyer.

A Sydney-based chief executive listens regularly. ‚ÄúIf you go to the pub with your mates and shoot the shit for a few hours, the conversation goes from the footy to taxes to ‚Äòdid you hear about the crazy celebrity?‚Äô‚Äù he says, also on the condition of anonymity. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what you get from Rogan. The people who say you‚Äôve got to be careful of Joe Rogan and the manosphere are people from legacy media who are losing out to him.‚Äù

Rogan‚Äôs podcasts are rambling and unpolished. Joe Rogan Library (JLR), a non-affiliated fan site, estimates they run for an average of almost two hours and 40 minutes. There‚Äôs been more than 2575, so it would take at least nine months to listen to all of them back-to-back. The JLR also estimates that 89 per cent of guests have been men. So far this year, Rogan has hosted chess grandmaster Magnus Carlsen, comedian Bill Murray, and ‚Äúexoneree‚Äù Amanda Knox.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs smart, and has interesting guests.‚Äù

An Australian Joe Rogan fan
It‚Äôs a conversation with no specific purpose, reminiscent of stoned freshmen lying on the university lawn and gazing at the stars. His schtick is open-minded curiosity about everything, even theories that are discredited. He hates talking points and scripts. He expects his guests to say what they think, rather than spin answers to avoid stepping on toes. He has the American comedian‚Äôs disgust at having his conversation hampered by ‚Äúwokeness‚Äù.

That‚Äôs exactly what Jack, 26, who works in insurance ‚Äì and did not want to give his last name ‚Äì enjoys. He thinks critics take Rogan too seriously. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs having a bit of fun,‚Äù says Jack, as Rogan‚Äôs commentary about the latest UFC fight blares across the sports bar at The Oaks, Neutral Bay on Sunday afternoon. ‚ÄúHe might be having a few drinks on the podcast. He‚Äôs debating things. They talk about interesting topics. A different point of view. I just think he‚Äôs a funny, good bloke.‚Äù

But Lauren Rosewarne, an associate professor in public policy at the University of Melbourne, argues this ‚Äúopen-minded curiosity‚Äù line is a slippery slope. ‚ÄúThis is the problem with a lot of conspiracy theory,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very much in line with what we think is critical thinking; ‚ÄòI‚Äôm only asking a question‚Äô. It somehow works to validate their entire message.‚Äù

About 10 years ago, Rogan contacted Szeps when a video of the Australian challenging someone‚Äôs posturing on air went viral. Rogan became a mentor. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not a polymath,‚Äù Szeps says of Rogan, ‚Äúbut he‚Äôs eclectic in his interests. [He has a way of noticing] what he finds interesting about a person and guiding it into mutual areas of interest, then shooting the shit about that in a way that, if it‚Äôs not fascinating every minute, is at least convivial and curious and unexpected.‚Äù

The conversation can go to strange places. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt intellectually tell you why I don‚Äôt believe in evolution,‚Äù actor Mel Gibson said in January this year, ‚Äúbut I don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs just a feeling.‚Äù Rogan pushed back, asking about early hominins such as Australopithecus; Gibson said they were hoaxes. They found a point of agreement in their climate change scepticism.

Rogan and a stoned-sounding actor Woody Harrelson affirmed their shared conspiracy theories about vaccination, while Rogan and J. D. Vance (then candidate, not yet vice president) laughed at jokes about billionaire Bill Gates made by their mate, billionaire Elon Musk: ‚ÄúThe funniest thing is when Elon showed a picture of Gates next to a pregnant woman [and said], ‚Äòif you want to lose a boner real fast‚Äô,‚Äù said Rogan. ‚ÄúElon is so funny. You get dumped on by one of the smartest guys alive.‚Äù

Australia‚Äôs stance during the COVID-19 pandemic put the country in Rogan‚Äôs sights. ‚ÄúI used to think Australia [could be a good place to live], but then I saw how they handled the pandemic,‚Äù he once said. ‚ÄúI was like, oh f---, that‚Äôs what happens when no one has guns. Yep, the army just rolls in and tells you what to do and puts you in concentration camps because you have a cold. It‚Äôs crazy.‚Äù

Even so, Rogan‚Äôs political positions are still unpredictable. His closeness with Team Trump did not stop him criticising forced deportations (‚Äúwe‚Äôve got to be careful that we don‚Äôt become monsters while we‚Äôre fighting monsters‚Äù). American academic Jonathan Haidt, author of The Coddling of the American Mind, once tried to articulate the concept of white privilege to Rogan. ‚ÄúThe real enemy is racism,‚Äù replied Rogan, ‚Äúit‚Äôs not just white people getting lucky.‚Äù

At the Oaks on Sunday afternoon, Russell, 26, says he was once a keen listener, but tunes in less since Rogan developed his anti-vaccination stance during COVID. The open-mindedness is shrinking. ‚ÄúHe took a dislike to the left side of the media [during COVID],‚Äù says Russell, who also did not want to give his last name. ‚ÄúHe used to be very open and explore different things, now he‚Äôs more closed off and [hosts] people that reinforce his own ideas. I still think he preaches healthy behaviours.‚Äù

Many of Rogan‚Äôs guests don‚Äôt share his views, but, having weighed up potential brand damage against potential publicity, come armed with enough anecdotes to ensure that the conversation doesn‚Äôt veer into risky territory. Russell Crowe talked about the dangers of fossil fuels, which didn‚Äôt get much response from Rogan, and told a rehearsed tale of being ‚Äúf---ed on the neck by a tarantula‚Äù. Brian Cox, the British physicist, explained black holes and deftly batted away Rogan‚Äôs theory that octopuses might be aliens. Bono gave a fascinating insight into his friendships with Johnny Cash and Frank Sinatra, but challenged Trump‚Äôs cuts to USAID.
The podcast recalls the popularity of talkback radio in Australia, which once attracted listeners in their millions to (mostly) men talking for hours about whatever took their fancy. The underlying appeal of both is what‚Äôs known as a parasocial relationship; that feeling of cosy familiarity, almost friendship, with a broadcaster. An Australian study found 43 per cent of men are experiencing loneliness. Perhaps part of Rogan‚Äôs appeal is that he is offering them blokey companionship from a studio in Austin, Texas, 14,000 kilometres away.

Rogan, 57, was born in New Jersey. His father was a police officer, and his parents divorced when he was five. ‚ÄúAll I remember of my dad are these brief, violent flashes of domestic violence,‚Äù he once said. He won the US Open Taekwondo Championships at age 19 then dropped out. He became a stand-up comic in the late 1980s, got an acting job on the comedy show NewsRadio in the mid-1990s and hosted the stunt show Fear Factor in the early 2000s.

But for many years, he was best known as an announcer for the Ultimate Fighting Championship, or UFC, a ‚Äúno-rules‚Äù martial arts competition with skyrocketing popularity among American and Australian men.

The UFC is where Rogan‚Äôs links to the Trump ecosystem were nurtured. UFC boss Dana White and Trump go back almost 25 years, to when so-called ‚Äúhuman cockfighting‚Äù was shunned by the mainstream. Trump was the only one who would host it, making his casinos available. White returned the favour by inviting Trump as a special guest after the January 20 riots. White has been credited with securing the ‚Äútestosterone vote‚Äù for Trump in last year‚Äôs election.

Rogan wasn‚Äôt always a Trump man. In 2022, he described the former president as an existential threat to democracy. But Rogan is a big fan of fellow vaccine sceptic Robert F. Kennedy. Rogan interviewed Trump for three hours during the US election campaign, and declined an interview with Harris. White said in January that he has been ‚Äúworking on Rogan for years ‚Ä¶ I knew that if I could get him and Trump together that they would hit it off‚Äù.

Rogan‚Äôs interviews with Trump, Vance and White House cost-cutter Musk brought the MAGA world to tens of millions of Americans before the election.

Rogan‚Äôs dip-in, dip-out listeners might make up their own minds about his ideas. But his audience is so big, and some of his guests so partisan or fringe, that many think he should take greater responsibility for what he broadcasts. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs appropriate, at his level of fame, for him not to have bothered investing in a couple of New York Times fact-checkers, to assist him in knowing if what he‚Äôs putting out there is true,‚Äù says Szeps.

Douglas Murray, a conservative commentator and recent Rogan guest, recently took aim at the podcast‚Äôs blurring of the line between opinion and expertise. ‚ÄúIt does not mean that a comedian can simply hold himself out as a Middle East expert and should be listened to as if he has any body of work,‚Äù he said. Or as Sam Harris ‚Äì philosopher, neuroscientist, and former Rogan guest ‚Äì said, ‚ÄúJoe is a genuinely good guy who wants good things for people. But he is honestly in over his head on so many topics of great consequence.‚Äù

In the United States, as in Australia, broadcasters are regulated, based on the view back when broadcast media took form that the first amendment right to free speech was not designed for mass reach, and that ‚Äúthat you can‚Äôt just let the market do whatever it wants to do in the airwaves, that there‚Äôs a social responsibility that comes with that ‚Äì democracy depends on it‚Äù, says Andy Ruddock, a senior lecturer in media at Monash University.

But podcasts, like so many other elements of the digital age, have evolved unfettered in an era when social responsibility is less valued than freedom and the individual. ‚ÄúThis is why [responding to] people like Rogan is quite difficult,‚Äù says Ruddock. ‚ÄúThis idea of, ‚Äòif I‚Äôm in your studio, and someone says I can‚Äôt say what I want to say, that‚Äôs an abridgement of my personal rights‚Äô, is based on the assumption that sitting in your studio talking to millions of people is the same as sitting outside the pub and talking to someone.‚Äù

This hyperfocus on the individual also worries Rosewarne for a different reason.

Many of Rogan‚Äôs followers, particularly young men and teen boys, are attracted to his ‚Äúlife optimisation‚Äù quest.

Many providers of Rogan‚Äôs supplements advertise on his show, or have his personal endorsement.

‚ÄúWho doesn‚Äôt want to be better?‚Äù says Rosewarne. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, that reasonable-sounding message leads into directions that get exacerbated. The body as a temple, and also worship of the self; these are incredibly narcissistic movements. This is at the heart of these conservative, pull-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps ethos, too; ‚Äòyou are in control of your destiny, you‚Äôre the main player‚Äô.‚Äù

Rosewarne suggests those who use Rogan as a road map for self-improvement should ask themselves whether it‚Äôs a positive addition to their lives. ‚ÄúOr does it constantly reiterate the message that you are not enough, like women‚Äôs magazines did?‚Äù says Rosewarne.

Rogan might have achieved world domination of the airwaves, but Rosewarne believes his influence is comparatively limited in Australia. ‚ÄúJust because Australians heartily embrace American popular culture, doesn‚Äôt mean we want to be Americans,‚Äù she says. Unlike in the US, ‚Äúa lot of people here aren‚Äôt looking at Joe Rogan for news, they‚Äôre looking at it for entertainment‚Äù.

If parents are worried about his influence on their son, ‚Äúwater down the message with alternate content,‚Äù Rosewarne says. ‚ÄúListen to it yourself, and have conversations. You‚Äôre not saying, ‚ÄòI hate what you like‚Äô, but have an environment where you can actually talk about what‚Äôs being spoken about, and critically think about it as well.‚Äù

1le6wwe,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1le6wwe/day_263/,Day 263,"We met in the center of town in early April some years ago, and ended up separated by miles and wreckage from a world that we no longer share.  
You told me you loved me, and that a year from that day, we would be planning our wedding.  You ended up telling me that you hated me a couple of years later, and that I'm not worth fighting for.  
You told me that you think nobody has ever loved me, and that you were going to show me what being loved felt like.  In the beginning of us, I felt I was falling in the most intimate love.  I've now fallen completely apart, and love is only a memory.  
I was full.  I knew myself, my soul, and my way.  I met you and there was laughter that I could feel was genuine and it felt so good.  The last time I spoke to you, I laughed and you told me that I'm the most awkward person you know.  I felt it hit my stomach and it made me feel like I was back in elementary school, hiding in the janitor's closet, a bathroom, or outside underneath a slide because of how badly kids made fun of me.  
We started off by drinking coffee, taking walks, and laying in the grass staring up at stars.  I was safe in your presence and you felt comfortable in mine.  I'm not sure that any of that was true now when I think back on it.  My feelings weren't safe.  You were not my safe space because you weren't you.  
You began hiding things.  You began telling me to leave, to get out of the house we made a home.  You began to yell at me, even for asking how your day was.  You stopped bringing me coffee in the morning time, in our bed where we once shared a lot of intimacy.  You grew cold, and I grew needy.  I was scared, and you were gone.  
Now there's a distance between us that carries the sound of a hallow city, and then nothing.  There's no reverberation where our echo used to carry out our laughter.  I knew love, and then I knew it to be conditional or fake.  I thought I knew that someone wanted me, loved me, and accepted me.  I know now that I'm still wandering this lonely journey alone, growing jaded, void of hope, and nearly dust.  
I'm scared that this is the end for me.  I'm scared that I'm grieving my own death, even if I go on living another hundred years.  I'm scared that I'll never find it in myself to be strong again.  I'm scared that everyone who has ever entered my life will eventually exit.  

  
My parents don't believe me about anything I've done, or anywhere I've been.  My daughter cannot wait to leave me.  My partner kicked me out of my own life.  My brothers live one thousand miles away and don't know who I am.  I've abandoned all of my friends.  I first fell in love with someone who beat me, so I grew strength and left.  I fell in love again a decade later and was lied to, cheated on, verbally, emotionally, mentally, and physically abused, and then broken up with and kicked out.  
I've lost hope, faith, love, time.  I've lost myself and I've lost my mind.  My heart was beaten and bruised and stabbed.  It was thrown into the garbage with any sort of memories I helped shape.  
I've been told I'm worthless, a waste of air, space, and energy.

* 2L of electrolytes per day help keep me feeling great and reduce some cravings
* Large protein shake for brekky around 7am:  1 cup cauliflower, 1 tbsp coffee powder, 1tbsp sugar free chocolate powder, 500mls skim milk blended for 1 minute
* Medium lunch at midday:  Cottage pie or similar
* One coffee late afternoon
* Small dinner around 4pm:  Boiled eggs, avocado etc
* Minimal snacks:  Perhaps nuts, yoghurt etc

I've reduced my carb intake and I have found eating a bit earlier helps me maintain energy levels and helps me keep those cravings at bay.  I've also reduced my meat intake a wee bit because I sometimes find some meats difficult to digest.  I have to be really careful around snacks too otherwise I find it easy to overindulge and it certainly adds up.

im studying and working part time now, and i dont totally hate it but i dont see myself going any further and working full time. by part time, i mean i work an hour a day and have school 4 hours a week. so im practically NEET 23/6. my work pays me a third of minimim wage, which is still a nice deal if i do the math. i live with family so i dont have to spend on anything except if im craving a particular food or item.

people irl make me feel that ive stagnated and expect me to get a job once i finish my course. thats why im planning to delay graduation another year or two. i dont mind studying, but im terrified of working. 

people here (irl again) dont exactly love work but they value it and the ""dignity of work"". my family would work even though they dont get paid. my father was literally offered a job just to hang out in an office doing nothing and he declined, so i know that while its highly unlikely, you could be paid for doing very little. 

so im getting this big disconnect irl because i dont believe in the whole business of getting a job. its not that i hate my job, its that i dont see it as having value in itself. i dont want to go on the self-improvement treadmill either. ive tried like a dozen times and it always made me feel worse about myself. it made me feel sorry for myself that im not neurotypical, or that im not a success in work or relationships, or that my body isnt healthy enough for the workouts or crash diets. 

im not a go-getter. even when i have goals, ive never felt passionate about them like other people, especially in self-help communities. it sucks. i want to have friends with the same ""interests"" but i dont want people pushing me to do something hours at a time or obsessing about this idea or method. why cant it be just chill baby steps? like i dont wanna revolve my whole life on this idea or cram my days with activities. i dont game, and i dont even binge watch and rarely doomscroll. i like being really really chill. 

thats all, i just cant relate or cope with the normal way of living thats doing a lot of stuff daily and having responsibilities and hobbies. maybe im afraid of commitment. maybe im childish and afraid of growing up. i dont know but i wish there were other people like me that maybe i could talk to or hang out with, just chilling, smell the coffee and see the flowers that kind of thing.

1le6txv,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1le6txv/had_a_golden_opportunity_to_be_petty_towards_some/,had a golden opportunity to be petty towards some racists at the boat marina,"This past weekend, I got a phone call from my dad telling me that he just got done with his yearly repairs on his money pit/yacht. He wanted to know if I was interested in spending saturday morning doing a testdrive around the lake and perhaps get a beer and lunch later on that day. Seeing how I had nothing else to do that day and would love to enjoy the wonderful summer lake breeze I took him up on that offer. I showed up at the marina ready to go for a morning out on the lake. I made my way over to dad‚Äôs slip to find him chatting up with the head of the local yacht club (who also happened to own the marina) who was good friends with my dad. Dad introduced me and the three of us had a few laughs as I put my stuff onboard. At one point, the owner mentioned that he had a couple extra cases of beer that my dad liked and wanted to know if he would like to have some to keep on the boat. My dad accepted and the two went off to go get the cases of beer.

Now to the meat of the story, while they were gone I decided that this was a good opportunity to use the bathroom. I have to note that while dad‚Äôs yacht did infact have a head onboard he had this rule about using it while still at the slip (you use it, you clean it). So I went to use the one at the marina. On the way to the bathroom I walked past another father-son duo (the racists of this encounter) in the process of¬† launching a small 14ft fishing boat. As I walked past I saw out of the corner of my eye the dad giving me a minor scowl; I thought nothing of it and continued on to the bathroom. On my way back I saw that the dad of the group was standing in my way; leading to this exchange:

Racist dad: ‚ÄúHey! You work here?‚Äù

me: ‚Äúme? No‚Äù

Racist dad (condescendly): ‚ÄúHah figured, mind telling me what you‚Äôre doing here then?‚Äù

Me: ‚Äúsame as you I imagine, going out on the lake‚Äù

Racist dad: ‚ÄúOh so you own a boat here?‚Äù

Me(with some snark): ‚ÄúIm sorry, I fail to see how that‚Äôs any of your business‚Äù

Racist dad: ‚Äúwell i'm making it my business boy!‚Äù

Now, as a black guy in Texas I‚Äôve encountered enough bigots to know when I'm dealing with one and for this guy, it was the way he said ‚Äúboy‚Äù that sounded the racist alarm in my head. I decided that the best thing to do was to pull out my phone and start recording but when I reached into my pocket, it wasn‚Äôt there. I remembered that my phone was in my drybag back on the boat.

Racist son: ‚Äúseems to us that you‚Äôre tresspassing‚Äù

Racist dad: ‚ÄùOr looking to steal something off one of these boats, after all it‚Äôs not like people like you actually own boats!‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúAs I said before, why im here is none of your business‚Äù

I brush past both of them and continue walking back to the slip when the son yells at me ‚Äúdon‚Äôt walk away from me"" and grabs my shoulder. I brushed his hand off and told him to keep his hands off me to which he replied ‚Äúor else what?‚Äù His dad chimed in ‚Äúthere‚Äôs one of you and two of us!‚Äù. Both men start to approach me and I'm contemplating having a 2v1 scenario when I decided that the next best thing to do since I did not have my phone on me was to try to make a scene with the hope that my dad and his buddy would notice and come to the scene unfolding. I put my hand out and yelled ‚ÄúBack up!‚Äù and ‚Äúget away from me!‚Äù Lucky for me, the yelling worked and both the marina owner and my dad arrived shortly after.

Owner: ‚ÄúHey! What is going on here?‚Äù

Racist dad: ‚Äúwe caught this boy here casing boats and looking for something to swipe‚Äù

Racist son: ‚Äúhe clearly doesn't belong here!‚Äù

me: \*speechless at their audacity\*

Racist dad: ‚Äútell you what, we‚Äôll hold him down while your associate here calls the cops‚Äù \*points to my dad\*

Owner: ‚ÄùOk, lets get two things straight here: \*points at my dad\* This man here is not an employee here; he‚Äôs a patron of this marina!‚Äù

Racist dad: ‚ÄúWait, what?‚Äù

Owner: ‚ÄúAlso that ‚Äòboy‚Äô you‚Äôre accusing of being a thief is his son!‚Äù

Racist dad: \*color starting to drain out his face\* ‚Äúoh‚Äù

Owner: ‚ÄúSo, I will give you two choices: you can either apologize and go about your day or you can find another boat ramp!‚Äù

The racist dad and his son looked at each other for a minute before sheepishly saying sorry before going back to launching their boat.

**\*The moment of petty revenge\***

About an hour later, me and my dad were driving the boat towards the marina entrance when my dad decided that he wanted some coffee from the galley. He told me to take the wheel and steer the yacht while he went below deck. While driving the boat I saw, anchored at the entrance to the marina no-wake zone and fishing, were the two racist idiots from earlier. The path of the yacht was on-course to have their boat pass by our starboard side. As the yacht got closer I found myself having an internal struggle: the good part of my personality told me to take the high road and just smile and wave while the evil part told me to be petty. Seeing how i'm posting here you can tell which side won. As the yacht got close I saw both of them look up at the yacht and saw their eyes grow wide at the sight of me driving a boat much bigger and nicer than theirs. In my pettines, I yelled out ‚Äú**Hide the money yhall, there‚Äôs poor people on the lake today!**‚Äù followed by the biggest smile I could muster as their jaws dropped.¬†",86,1750216613.0,pettyrevenge,20,0.89,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **KBO Showdown: SSG Landers vs. Kiwoom Heroes ‚Äì A Tale of Underdogs and Over/Under 8.5 Runs**

**The Setup:** The Kiwoom Heroes (1.69 implied probability to win) host the SSG Landers (2.10 implied probability), who are somehow still trying to prove they‚Äôre not just a ""land-locked"" version of the Heroes. The spread? Kiwoom is a modest -1.5-run favorite, because even heroes need a little nudge to stay relevant.

**Odds Breakdown (Because Math is Heroic Too):**

* **Moneyline:** Backing Kiwoom Heroes at \~1.7 odds is like ordering a ""hero"" coffee‚Äîoverpriced but *technically* a safe bet. SSG Landers at +2.10 are the ""I‚Äôll take my chances with this unknown"" pick, statistically equivalent to betting on your third cousin to win a dance-off.
* **Spread:** Kiwoom -1.5 (-110 to -120) is the ""I‚Äôve got this, but not by much"" bet. SSG +1.5 (-110 to -105) is for those who enjoy the thrill of watching underdogs defy logic‚Ä¶ and then fail.
* **Totals:** The 8.5-run over/under is the ""boring middle ground"" of KBO betting. Over (1.80-1.91) requires hope that these teams remember how to swing for the fences. Under (1.94-2.0) is for pessimists who‚Äôve seen too many rain delays and suspect this game will be a dud.

**Prediction (With Sarcasm):**  
The Heroes will likely win, but not by enough to cover the spread (-1.5). Imagine a movie where the hero defeats the villain but forgets to *actually save the day*. The game will likely end 4-3 or 5-4, with the total runs hovering around the 8.5 mark like a mosquito near a bare leg.

**Final Verdict:**

* **Safe Bet:** Kiwoom Heroes moneyline (1.69 implied) for the ""status quo"" play.
* **Gamble:** SSG Landers +1.5 (-105) if you believe in miracles and/or have a death wish.
* **Over/Under:** Under 8.5 (1.95) because KBO pitchers are currently conspiring to keep this league‚Äôs offense in a chokehold.

**Player Props?** None here, folks. This game is a prop-free zone. Just two teams and a bunch of bookmakers trying to profit from your confusion.

My husband has a stressful job. He‚Äôs a project manager for $500-800M of construction jobs, sometimes exceeding that. He‚Äôs only 33 and the only guy ahead of him is retiring soon so he‚Äôll have even more on his plate. 

I don‚Äôt see my parents anymore. His parents are very nice usually, but a few times a year they go a little nuts and I need a break from them. We‚Äôre in one of those times. 

We have a tenant who just moved into our basement. She moves out in September so we‚Äôre looking for another. The one we had lined up backed out. We also still own our old house 30 mins away, which we rent to 2 families (it‚Äôs a 2 family house) and they‚Äôre great long term tenants but every month it‚Äôs an ordeal to go get the rent, they have excuses and we are understanding but it‚Äôs not a low effort task. 

We do honey bee rescues and removals, some free but mostly paid. Commercial buildings can bring in a few thousand per removal, obviously we don‚Äôt kill the bees, we relocate to our farm upstate. But he handles all the calls (10-20 per week) which are mostly dead ends, the site visits (1-2 per week) and the actual removals (1-3 per month April-September). 

He usually wakes up at 6am and makes us both breakfast and coffee, we eat together sometimes with the baby if he‚Äôs already up, he does garbage and recycling duty, feeds the chickens and ducks, makes sure sprinklers are in place for the day, and goes to work. He‚Äôs usually about an hour late every day. This week I started waking up at 5:15am to get myself ready, feed the baby and try to get him back to sleep, and make breakfast for us both. 

We decided to start camping. We did it for the past 2 weekends, super fun but exhausting. We want to go again but it seems insane with eve thing else going on. 

We got into a fight on Father‚Äôs Day so I‚Äôd like to give him a re-do this weekend. Any ideas what I can plan?

Ah, the ol‚Äô ‚Äúis college a scam?‚Äù debate ‚Äî the intellectual equivalent of yelling ‚ÄúFree Bird!‚Äù at an economics lecture.

Let‚Äôs break it down without the tribal warfare ‚Äî no Turning Point USA hats, no Marxist study group stickers ‚Äî just straight facts, Gen X-to-Z real talk style:

# üí∞ The Case For ""College is a Scam"" (a la Charlie Kirk & Co.):

1. **Crushing Student Debt:**
   * Average student loan debt in the U.S. is over **$30,000**. Some majors leave you drowning in debt for a degree that barely opens doors.
2. **Overpriced & Under-delivered:**
   * You pay $50K a year to sit through PowerPoints from adjuncts making $30K. Then you learn more on YouTube in an hour than in a semester.
3. **Ideological Indoctrination?**
   * Right-wing critics like Kirk argue colleges are breeding grounds for ""woke"" ideology and leftist politics, not critical thinking. (There‚Äôs *some* truth in echo chambers depending on the school.)
4. **Outdated Curriculum:**
   * You get a communications degree but can‚Äôt make a resume or budget. Meanwhile, your cousin on YouTube makes $10K/month doing prank videos and drop shipping.
5. **Trades & Tech Rule Now:**
   * Plumbers, electricians, coders, and IT techs are thriving ‚Äî with no degrees and no debt. College isn‚Äôt the only path anymore.

# üéì The Case Against ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a Scam‚Äù (Why College Still Matters):

1. **Higher Lifetime Earnings:**
   * On average, college grads earn **$1 million+ more** over a lifetime than non-grads. Stats don‚Äôt lie (though averages can be misleading ‚Äî looking at you, liberal arts debt survivors).
2. **Some Degrees** ***Do*** **Pay Off:**
   * Engineering, Computer Science, Nursing, Finance ‚Äî if you‚Äôre in these, you‚Äôre good. ROI (Return on Investment) can be huge.
3. **Networks & Credentials:**
   * College is often about *access* ‚Äî alumni networks, internships, credentials that open high-status jobs that you just *can‚Äôt* get otherwise.
4. **Personal Growth:**
   * For some, college is the place they figure themselves out ‚Äî emotionally, intellectually, even sexually (let‚Äôs be real). That‚Äôs not nothing.
5. **Gatekeeping Professions:**
   * Want to be a lawyer, doctor, therapist, teacher, or scientist? Tough luck without a degree. Some systems are built around the credential pipeline.

# üß† The Balanced Truth (Your Friendly Gen Z-Fueled Wisdom):

* **College isn‚Äôt a scam ‚Äî but it is a** ***product*****.** And like any product, you should shop smart. Don‚Äôt pay Ferrari prices for a go-kart degree.
* **Not all degrees are created equal.** A philosophy degree from Yale is different from one at ""Totally Real State University.""
* **The system needs reform.** Big time. Cheaper tuition, better curriculum, and fewer useless gen ed classes about mold spores and 18th-century basket weaving.

# üî• TL;DR Hot Take:

**College is only a scam if you treat it like a magic ticket instead of a strategic investment.**  
Pick a degree that pays, know your ROI, and don‚Äôt go into debt for something you could‚Äôve Googled for free.

Or, ya know, join a trade, build a business, or become a creator. Just don‚Äôt get bamboozled either way. Kirk‚Äôs got a point *if* you‚Äôre a sucker ‚Äî but if you‚Äôre smart, you‚Äôll game the system, not get played by it.

1le6l23,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1le6l23/pennys_playroom/,Penny's Playroom,"How many of you who grew up in Canada during the late 1990s/early 2000s remember that creepy children's show *Penny's Playroom*?

Not very many, I imagine; the show is incredibly obscure.  Almost no proof of its existence can be found on the internet.  No video clips, no still frames.  No mentions on old TV listings.  No Wikipedia or IMDb pages.  If it weren't for the online testimonies from people who watched the show as children, it would be easy to conclude that *Penny's Playroom* never existed at all.

But exist it did.  I remember it, and so do a few others, who turned to Reddit and other forums seeking proof that the show hadn't been some crazy fever dream.  Based on everyone's combined recollections, this is what is known about the show:

*Penny's Playroom* aired on a popular Canadian children's channel for about five years (c. 1997-c. 2002).  It was a blend of puppetry and live action and followed the adventures of Lillian, a little girl who would spend afternoons after school at her Gran's house while her parents were at work.  Now, tucked away at the back of the house was a long-neglected room that had once served as a playroom for Lillian's mother and uncles when they were kids.  Most of the toys had been packed up and stored away, but a few had been left behind.  These included the titular Penny, a rag doll with braided blonde pigtails and a red gingham dress; Nutmeg, a one-eyed teddy bear; Coco, a wooden monkey; Jack, a plastic sailor figurine; and Zippy, a wind-up mouse.  Other characters included Max and Amanda, Lillian's two best friends, and Mr. Whimsyflip, Nana's neighbour who was an inventor and who would often drop by the house to show Lillian his latest gadget.

All sounds pretty innocuous, right?  Well, not exactly.  If there's one thing us who remember *Penny's Playroom* can always agree on, it's that the show was deeply unsettling.  The puppets (*especially* Coco and Jack) looked as creepy as sin, but that was only the beginning.  Gran's house wasn't colourful and cheerful in its design, the way you'd expect the setting of a children's show to be.  Instead, it was dark, shabby, and gloomy.  The playroom itself looked more like an interrogation room than a place for children to play, with blank white walls, a cement floor, and no windows.  As for Gran herself, you never saw her face.  She always had her back turned to the audience... and to the other characters.  She never spoke, communicating through hand gestures and shaking or nodding her head.  And while she appeared to be played by a human actress, her movements were stiff and jerky like those of a malfunctioning animatronic, plunging her deep into the uncanny valley.

Adding to the weirdness was the nervous behaviour of the actors playing Lillian, Max, Amanda, and Mr. Whimsyflip.  They always seemed on edge, and this leaked into their acting.  Their lines often came out stilted and stuttered, their facial expressions appearing forced and strained.  One former viewer even described it as ""as if they were being held at knifepoint. Forced in front of the camera under the threat of violence.""

All those things combined created a show that was eerie at best and downright terrifying at worst in spite of its rather lighthearted premise and themes.  Throw in the show's overall poor quality and it's honestly a surprise that it managed to stay on air for half a decade.  During that time, though, it achieved no real popularity or success, and quickly faded into near-complete obscurity once it stopped airing.  No reruns were ever shown, nor were there ever any DVD releases.  The kids who had watched it grew up, and many of them forgot about it entirely.

But some did not.  Including myself.

I hadn't thought about *Penny's Playroom* in years.  But in my late teens, I developed a fascination with lost media and started a YouTube channel dedicated to the topic.  Through my research, I discovered that my home country of Canada had a lot of lost media, especially children's shows... and *Penny's Playroom* was among them.  Memories of that weird show came flooding back, and the discovery that it was completely lost with no real proof of its existence only amped up the creep factor.  I had recently decided that, for my channel's one-year anniversary, I would do a documentary series on lost Canadian children's shows, and now I wanted *Penny's Playroom* to be a part of it.

There was just one problem: I had nothing to work with.  Oh, there were the accounts from others who had seen the show, but those didn't count, as they didn't tell me anything I didn't already know.  I needed solid information.  Who had produced the show?  What were the names of the actors and puppeteers and what had they been doing since the show ended?  Where had the filming taken place? Why was the show so low-quality?  How had it managed to last as long as it did?

I decided that my best bet would be to appeal to the public for information.  I knew it was a long shot, but I made a video where I explained my plans to make a video about *Penny's Playroom* and requested that anyone who knew anything about the show or had any connection to it contact me.  I wouldn't disclose their name or any personal information; I just had some questions I wanted answered.

I didn't really expect it to work... but the very next day, I received an email from a woman who introduced herself as Emily Perret.  She said that she had worked on the show and would be glad to meet with me and tell me everything I wanted to know.  I was elated, but skeptical.  What were the chances that someone with such a direct connection to *Penny's Playroom* would see my video and contact me within such a small time frame?  But I agreed, figuring that, at worst, this would be a hoax and I would feel stupid.  I could deal with that.  Emily revealed that she lived in the same city as I did (Windsor, Ontario) so we agreed to meet at a local coffee shop.

I was sitting at a table near the back, sipping a vanilla latte, when a young woman (not much older than myself) walked in and approached me.  ""Natalie?""

Looking at her, I felt a jolt of recognition.  Red hair, though cut in a shoulder-length bob instead of falling in a sleek line down her back.  Big brown eyes.  Pale skin.  Round face sprinkled with freckles.  ""L-*Lillian*?""

""Well, I haven't been Lillian since I was a kid. But I guess that's what you'd know me by.""  She sat down across from me.  ""I rarely come across anyone who remembers *Penny's Playroom*. And honestly? I'm thankful for that.""

""What do you mean?"" I asked her.

Lillian (no, *Emily*) sighed.  ""It's not a time of my life I like to revisit.""

""I'm... sorry,"" I said stiffly.  ""I didn't mean to dredge up bad memories.""

She waved dismissively.  ""Hey, it's fine. If I didn't want to do this, I wouldn't have agreed to meet you. Listen, Natalie.""  She fixed her serious brown eyes on me.  ""I said I'd answer your questions, and I will. But it'd be for the best if you didn't include *Penny's Playroom* in your documentary series. Let it be forgotten.""

I frowned.  ""Why?""

""Hold on a sec. I need some coffee.""  Emily went to stand in line, and I got out the pen and notebook I had brought for taking notes.  My mind was a whirl of confusion.  Why did Emily not like talking about the show?  Why did she seem adamant I not include it in my documentary series?  It was a very long ten minutes before Emily returned, coffee in hand.

""Let me tell you about the show first,"" she said.

I uncapped my pen.  ""Shoot.""

She took a long sip of coffee, dabbed at her lips with a paper napkin.  ""As you know, I played Lillian. And Lillian's Gran... that was *my* grandmother playing her. The house was her house... and it's right here. In Windsor.""

I was shocked.  *Penny's Playroom* had been filmed right here in my hometown?

""It's not far from here,"" Emily continued.  ""Chances are you've driven past it and didn't even know it.""

""Maybe.""  I tapped my pen on the open page.  ""So how old were you when you started acting on the show?""

""Five,"" said Emily.  ""And I was about ten when it finally ended. Most shows would have replaced me, but Gran would never allow it. She was a control freak when it came to that show.""

""So she was the one behind it?""

""Yes.""

""But you didn't want to be on the show, did you?""

""No.""

""I'm sorry,"" I said, finally understanding why she always seemed so nervous.  ""What about the others?""

""The others?""

""Amanda. Max. Mr. Whimsyflip. Did *they* want to be on the show?""

""No. None of us did.""  Emily cast her eyes downward, looking sad.  ""I'm the only one left, you know.""

""Wait. They're *dead*?""

She didn't answer, but the silence told me everything I needed to know.

I hadn't even written anything down.  Suddenly, I was deeply uncomfortable with this whole situation and felt just terrible for Emily.  Something dark had taken place behind the scenes of *Penny's Playroom*, and while I was definitely curious, I felt that it wasn't my place to pry.

""Listen,"" I said to Emily.  ""We don't have to do this. I won't mention the show. I'll pretend this meeting never took place. But can you at least tell me the house's address? It might be cool to drive by. Just a quick peek. I won't take any pictures or tell anyone where it is.""

Emily bit her lip, hesitant, but then nodded and told me the address.  We shook hands, and then she stood and walk out of the coffee shop.

I lingered for a while, finishing my now-lukewarm coffee.  My encounter with Emily had left me far more unsettled than *Penny's Playroom* ever had... but my curiously burned bright.  I knew that I couldn't head home without seeing the house.  So I tossed my empty cup in the trash, headed out to my car, and drove to the address Emily had provided me.

The house in question was a grey Victorian with an apple tree in the front yard.  The curtains in every window were drawn, which was odd.  As I stared, though, the ones in the living room window twitched.  It was a blink-and-you'll-miss-it movement, but I knew I hadn't been mistaken.  My curiosity getting the better of me, I exited the car and began walking closer to get a better look.  I was halfway up the front path when the door opened, revealing Emily.

""Sorry!"" I said.  ""I didn't mean to... I'm sorry. I'll leave.""

""No, it's okay. Want to come in?""

I blinked.  ""Are you sure?""

""Yeah. Gran doesn't like guests, but she's taking her nap. As long as you stay quiet.""

I nodded and stepped inside.  The foyer was dark, with the musty smell of an old library.  I blinked a few times as my eyes adjusted... and yelped at the sight of the figure standing at the foot of the stairs.

""Sorry!"" I whispered.

Emily smiled.  ""Meet Coco.""

I didn't mention this before, but Coco was pretty big.  Almost two feet tall, with ball-jointed arms and legs and a long tail that dragged on the floor behind her.  Seeing her up close and personal, I was reminded of how creepy I found her as a kid.  It didn't help that she seemed to have undergone significant wear and tear in the years since the show.  Her right ear was missing, as was her left thumb, and her body was so splintery in places that it resembled tufts of hair.

""She's supposed to be in the play room,"" said Emily.  ""Looks like she got loose again.""  She picked Coco up and began moving deeper into the house.  With nothing better to do, I began to follow her.

As we walked through the house, I noted how dark it was and how neglected it looked, every surface thick with dust, cobwebs gathered in the corners like shadows.  Still, it was definitely the house from the show.  I recognized the worn brown couch in the living room, the painting of a barn on the wall.  When Emily came to a stop, it was at the very back of the house.  In front of a red door.

""Is this...""

She nodded.  ""Yes.""  And then she opened the door.

The playroom was just as I remembered from the show.  Dim, cold, and ugly, its only furnishings being an old toy box pushed up against the wall and a round plastic table in the centre, surrounded by plastic chairs.  In each chair sat a toy, and each of them looked as worn as Coco.  Penny's dress was threadbare and faded.  Both of Nutmeg's eyes were missing.  Jack's head looked caved in on one side, and Zippy had a large tear down his front, stuffing spilling out like guts.  Emily placed Coco in the one remaining empty chair, next to Penny.

As I stared at the odd scene before me, I noticed something.  Placed in the middle of the table were three round white objects.  The big one in the middle wore safety goggles, and the smaller ones wore a red baseball cap and a pink butterfly clip in a single patch of curly dark hair.  And each of them stared back at me with empty black sockets.

Mr. Whimsyflip.  Max.  Amanda.  Their *skulls* were arranged on the table in a grotesque centrepiece.

But before I could even begin to process the horror of what I was seeing, a shuffling noise had me whirling around, my heart slammed up into my throat hard enough to choke me.

My eyes landed on a pair of grey slippers peeking out beneath the hem of a blue housecoat.  My eyes slowly traveled up her body, sliding uncomprehendingly over the face and settling on the grey hair piled atop her head in a large bun before dropping to the face and staying there.

And I knew why the viewer never saw Nana's face.  Why she never spoke.

Stretching from her hairline to her sharp chin was a gaping hole.  There was no blood, no gore.  No exposed tissue or bone.  Just a dark pit yawning at me like the mouth of a cave.  As if her features had been scooped out cleanly with a giant ice cream scooper.

For a moment, the shock rendered me completely numb.  I could not move.  I could not speak.  I could not *think*.  Then panic hit me like a lightning bolt, and I screamed.

I ran.  I pushed past Gran and took off down the hall, shrieking all the way.  My heart pounded so hard it felt like it would burst, and my ears roared with adrenaline.  But underneath that noise, I heard sounds that scraped sharp, jagged claws over my bones.  Footsteps from feet made of wood and plastic and felt.  High-pitched, demented laughter.  And childish voices calling to me, asking me to stay and play, to join them in Penny's playroom.

I slammed out the door, dove into my car, and sped off.  In my state, I didn't even know if I was going in the right direction, and honestly, I didn't care.  As long as I got as far away from that place as possible.

I can't tell you how long I drove before the adrenaline wore off, but when it did, I pulled over and slumped over my steering wheel, trembling harder than I ever had in my life.  It was a long time before I could start moving again, and even longer before my heartbeat slowed to the point where I no longer felt like I was dying.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All that was seven years ago.

I never told anyone what happened.  I made my documentary series, but *Penny's Playroom* wasn't even so much as mentioned.  I did what I had promised Emily and pretended our meeting had never taken place.

To this day, I'm not sure what Emily's intentions were.  Did she lure me into that house with plans to do something terrible to me?  Make me suffer the same fate as Max and Amanda and Mr. Whimsyflip?  Or did she mean me no harm?  I guess I'll never know.  But it won't do me any good to dwell.  I escaped.  I survived.  I recovered from the trauma.  That's what matters.

So why am I posting my story here?  Why am I dredging this all up after staying silent for so long?

Well, you see, a good friend of mine went missing a couple of weeks ago.  We had met online, bonding over our shared fascination with lost media.  Based on what her brother told me when he called me in the hopes that I might know something about the disappearance, she left her apartment after telling her Mum through text that she had an ""appointment"" and never returned; all attempts to reach her had failed, and the police didn't seem too worried, seeing as she's a grown woman and left of her own volition.  But her family feared something terrible might have happened to her.

""You and my sister... you're both into lost media, right?"" her brother said.

""Yes,"" I told him.  ""Why?""

""Well, this is probably a red herring, but not long before her disappearance, she told me how she was looking into a lost children's show. And when I say lost I mean *lost*. It's so obscure its very existence is debated. We both remember watching it when we were kids, but I thought I had imagined it until my sister told me otherwise.""

I suddenly felt cold all over.  ""Is that so?""

""Yes.""

""And what's the show called? Do you know?""

""Yes. Maybe you've heard of it too. Maybe you even saw it yourself,"" said her brother.  ""It's called *Penny's Playroom*.""

I think I‚Äôm close guys! So this test is basically test #8 but with half a tbsp of peanut butter and baked for 16 mins. I let it chill overnight. When I ate it this morning, WOW.

Best part, only 2 farts throughout the day! Even with the addition of peanut butter, the macros are still amazing. Can add a topping or some mix-ins and have it just below or above 500 calories.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **KBO Showdown: Doosan Bears vs. Samsung Lions ‚Äì June 18, 2025**  
**Prediction: ""The Lions Roar, the Bears Whimper (But at Least They‚Äôre Not the Tigers)""**

The Samsung Lions (-1.5, 1.77) are favored to stomp the Doosan Bears (2.8‚Äì2.9) harder than a Seoul subway rider steps on a pedestrian. With a **10.5-run total** (Even money), this could be a fireworks show or a snoozefest‚ÄîSamsung‚Äôs offense is clicking like a well-oiled Hyundai engine, while Doosan‚Äôs pitching looks about as reliable as a fan trying to pick a KBO team on a dare.

**Key Props to Consider (If You‚Äôre Brave Enough):**

* **Moneyline**: Bet Samsung Lions at **1.41‚Äì1.43** (they‚Äôre the sports equivalent of a free coffee at Starbucks).
* **Spread**: Take Samsung -1.5 (**1.77‚Äì1.8**) if you trust a team that‚Äôs scored like a caffeinated golfer in a putting contest.
* **Doosan Bears +1.5**: **2.0‚Äì2.05** (only for masochists or those with a sports psychologist‚Äôs number saved).

**Why It‚Äôs a Laugh**: The Bears‚Äô best shot? Stealing a few bases and hoping Samsung‚Äôs pitchers throw more wild pitches than a TikTok dance-off. Meanwhile, Samsung‚Äôs hitters might hit so many homers, the park could rename the outfield ""Doosan‚Äôs Despair.""

**Final Verdict**: Samsung wins **6-2**, the total goes **Under** (because even this mismatch needs a break), and Doosan‚Äôs manager gets a standing ovation for not quitting‚Ä¶ yet.

*Bet responsibly, or don‚Äôt. The Bears aren‚Äôt exactly a money-maker either.* üêÖü¶ÅÔ∏è

1le6ihv,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1le6ihv/what_happens_at_the_end_im_exhausted/,What happens at the end? Im exhausted,"I (27M) am married and live a pretty stable life with my wife. My relationship with my father has always been complicated‚Äîhe‚Äôs emotionally volatile, narcissistic, often racist, and dismissive of my lived experiences. He was born in 1968 in Medell√≠n, Colombia, raised in an elite, upper-middle class military family on a massive coffee plantation. 

Think colonial-style wealth, pride, and superiority complex. My mom, on the other hand, came from extreme poverty in Bogot√°. Honestly, I think she married him for stability, but still treats him like a child. He lives rent-free in her house in the U.S. now, and she enables his behavior to this day.

He lost all his money due to mismanagement and just being a jerk. Now hes broke, and living in his ex wifes house. All his money, busines, gone. He never helped pay for my college, nothing.

 My dad moved to the U.S. in 2000 when I was 2. Since then, he's had a superiority complex about everything‚Äîidolizing whiteness, the U.S., denying racism exists, and constantly gaslighting me. Every time I bring up my trauma or critique the system here, he mocks me, calls me paranoid, or says it's all fake.

To give you an idea of how dismissive he is of my reality: I was recently harassed by a maintenance worker in my apartment complex. The guy followed me to my door, yelling at me aggressively, invading my space, and at one point shouted, ‚ÄúI know where you live.‚Äù I felt threatened and shaken. 

When I told my dad about it‚Äîhoping for concern, or at least acknowledgment‚Äîhe just shrugged and said, ‚ÄúOh, you probably misunderstood him. Maybe he was just being friendly.‚Äù That‚Äôs the level of delusion I‚Äôm dealing with. He completely minimizes anything that doesn‚Äôt fit his version of reality. No concern. No empathy. Just gaslighting. i dont even know why i keep telling him things.

On Father‚Äôs Day. It started with him screaming at me on the phone for waking up late (I have insomnia, which he knows, and struggles with himself). Then he switched to being overly bubbly and happy when we went out to eat, got drunk, and started rambling loudly in public. Eventually, our conversation turned serious‚Äîhe brought up the family‚Äôs plans to move to Spain, which led me to share my frustrations about life in America and my reasons for wanting to move to a more peaceful, well-developed Asian country (my wife country)

He immediately shut me down, praised America in a weird, nationalistic rant, and called all other countries ""backwards""‚Äîeven though he‚Äôs visited the country I want to move to multiple times and has even said he wanted to retire there. He said racist things, denied school violence and drugs exist in the U.S., and basically blamed me for my own trauma.

But here‚Äôs where it got really weird.

When we got back in the car, I told him how I want to live honestly and spiritually, and how my wife and I are building something real. I brought up how I talk to my therapist about the damage he‚Äôs done. He had nothing to say. I asked basic questions and he just‚Ä¶ stared off into space.

 Silent. Then he started repeating the same phrase over and over: ‚ÄúThere is none. There is none.‚Äù Like a robot. He ignored me and my wife. It was the most eerie, unsettling thing I‚Äôve ever seen. He wasn‚Äôt drunk anymore‚Äîhe was disassociated. Blank. Gone.


When I dropped him off, he hugged us both without saying anything and walked away. Just completely... empty.

Now I‚Äôm sitting here thinking: what the hell was that?

Is he:

Having a cognitive breakdown? Early dementia?

Emotionally collapsing because he‚Äôs losing control over me?

Ashamed but incapable of apologizing or showing real emotion?

Just... faking his ""niceness"" and now the mask is slipping?

I was crying im so tired.

He‚Äôs still trying to be involved in my life. Calls maybe once a week. Tries to act normal. But I‚Äôm done pretending. I don‚Äôt think I can take care of him when he‚Äôs older. I think he‚Äôs going to get worse. I don‚Äôt want him ruining my peace or manipulating my wife into putting a business under her name.

Unlike my mom who's not in my life at all, he still reaches out about ince weekly and acts very happy as if life is perfect..one wrong move and he will punish me and treat me terribly and gaslight me and blame me for everything.

My mom when I was a kid let her boyfriend beat me until bloody and she would laugh and side with him. I haven't forgiven her for that. My mom as a kid used to steal my money amd open credit cards using my SSN. Now, she doesn't do any of that, she's just aloof with her drunk bf watching sports every single day.

I‚Äôm scared. I‚Äôm angry. And I‚Äôm tired.

What the hell is this behavior? Has anyone else seen this in their narcissistic parents? What happens next? What is the prognosis with someone like this?

How do they die in the end?

I dont wanna be his age and dealing with a angry old man. I wanna be free. But letting go is tough.

**THE PIVOT**

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs fire everyone,‚Äù says Sam.

‚ÄúEr,‚Äù says Davis. ‚ÄúUm. Well, that‚Äôs certainly one way to do things.‚Äù It‚Äôs 9:30 AM. He‚Äôs had two espressos today already.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm serious. We have to face facts. We need a hard reset. A clean slate.‚Äù

Davis paces the conference room restlessly. The glass is frosted up to 6 feet, which means all his employees know when their CEO is having a tough meeting because they see the top of his hair bobbing back and forth, like a worried, sentient toupee.

‚ÄúLook, I appreciate the radical runway extension. But even if we were down to a skeleton crew of, I don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Davis sighs, mentally counting personnel, and mentally assigning himself the work of three normal engineers. ‚ÄúFive people, say, to keep the product running. We‚Äôre not going to grow our way out of this if we have no one to sell, or build, or‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúWe cannot sell this shit, Davis.‚Äù Sam drops his voice, to sound more serious. Sam is Davis‚Äô chief-of-staff. He is only 22, and he still sounds 22. He is also 6‚Äô3‚Äù, super handsome, a New Englander from his blonde hair down to his boat shoes. He alternates between weeks of consuming nothing but protein bars and energy drinks and Eastern European snuff films, and weeks of monastic purity, eating handfuls of nuts and taking punishing cold showers. His appearance speaks of well-groomed power. But he doesn‚Äôt have any power, of course. Davis has power. Sam has always approached Davis with a reverent, intensely earnest posture, and Davis would be lying if he said this didn‚Äôt bring him some real gratification.

So this harsh statement, coming from Sam, is enough to stop Davis in his tracks. ‚ÄúTom‚Äôs numbers are still good,‚Äù he says woodenly.

‚ÄúTom. Is not replicable. And Tom will back me up on this. Honestly, Davis, he‚Äôs interviewing at Square.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Davis sits down very heavily. This is a serious loss. Tom is the VP of Zuby‚Äôs small sales team, and also their top salesperson, and the only person who has been able to sell manufacturers on Zuby in any serious quantity. ‚ÄúFuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck.‚Äù

‚ÄúLook, man, you know I admire the fuck out of you,‚Äù Sam says, all sweetness again. ‚ÄúAnd I think the worst case scenario for you, and for me! Like, being honest here. Is that Q3 numbers are just good enough to keep going, and then Q4 is good, because Q4, and organic gingerbread or whatever, and then we raise a fucking terrible Series C, like a down round or something, and then you and me are stuck doing something that is fundamentally doomed for another 2 years. And then we shut down. Like, psychic damage, you know?‚Äù

Davis is resisting the urge to slam his head into the conference room table. He ponders if his skull could break it. The table is glass, covered in a rainbow holographic treatment, and left over from the office‚Äôs previous tenants, a failed anime porn company. He bought it from them in the spirit of thrift for $150.

‚ÄúLook, I have something to pitch you.‚Äù

Davis doesn‚Äôt respond right away. He is retracing his steps, from the first spark of inspiration to the first customer interviews to the first pitch, looking for a flaw in his work, trying to figure out what small or large mechanism he can tinker with to make this thing work. This is what is most lovable about Davis‚Äî his megawatt attention, shackled firmly to his stubborn, irrational heart.

‚ÄúOkay, go,‚Äù Davis says finally, with a sigh.

Had any other Zuby employee been in the room to hear his pitch, they‚Äôd probably throw Sam‚Äôs purple bottle of Future Freeze Prime at his head.

\~\*\~

Davis Budny is Zuby‚Äôs founder and CEO. He is 28, and all that everyone feels a young man should be. He is possessed of two funding rounds, technical skills both broad and current, vision and verve, an attractively furnished apartment, thick brown hair, and a three-legged rescue cat. Until 26 he sported slightly below average looks compensated for by his reedy, 6‚Äô2‚Äù height, but two years ago he discovered he could grow very flattering facial hair, and much was remedied by this.

Davis likes to make people happy. His mother is a history professor; his father was a software engineer. Davis‚Äô teachers often said he was ‚Äúraised right.‚Äù By this, they likely meant that despite being remarkably, remarkably smart, Davis never seemed lazy nor arrogant. This is because Davis is neither lazy nor arrogant. On the contrary, Davis is born of Polish peasant stock on both sides and has all the work ethic of his ancestors, and a great willingness to think himself ordinary.

He did suspect at a young age that he might have a special sort of brain. He often pictured his own brain as a plodding draft horse, head down, muscles straining. Cleverer students would listen to lectures at 2x; Davis was pausing so often he basically listened at .5x. But after a certain amount of heavy pondering, he would find that he had internalized the lesson so deeply that he could suddenly slingshot far ahead, rushing past the current state of the field. Later, a VC would tell him that he really thought ‚Äúfrom first principles,‚Äù a compliment Davis earnestly cherished until he realized the investor told everybody that.

Zuby is Davis‚Äô second company. He doesn‚Äôt like to talk about the first, because of the dogs, which were truly not his fault! And likely already aggressive and badly trained. Unfortunately the dogs made him a bit of a Silicon Valley punchline for a few years, which caused his natural brilliance to go under-recognized. Luckily, with his usual inherent wisdom, Davis humbly retreated to a quiet enterprise software company hidden in the waystation of San Jose, and their eventual IPO gave him both $2.7m in long-term capital gains and enough courage to try again.

There are 38 employees at Zuby (54 if you count contractors, which the team normally does not). 9 of these employees like Davis, 23 feel neutrally, and 6 employees think he is a moron and/or jerk. A 16% malcontent rate is actually very good for a series B company. Too good, some of the investors say. ‚ÄúSoft on people,‚Äù they say.

It‚Äôs true that despite being blessed with above average salaries, a top-tier health insurance plan, and a generous CEO who carries the gentle air of apology that all software engineers educated at liberal arts colleges share, the employees of Zuby are garrulous, dissatisfied, and prone to spending hours agitating each other to mutiny in secretive Slack channels with names like Thursday-committee and Zuby-cozy-gamers. Half the company thinks the company is going under. Half the company thinks capitalism should be replaced. Most of the company thinks Davis could be doing a better job and no grouping more permanent than 2 individuals on a coffee date for 30 min can agree on what he should be doing differently.

Among those of the 38 who will bother to reminisce on this brief, clumsy brio of human ambition coalesced into a b2b commerce platform, this particular day, August 5th, will stand in infamy. Pivot Day, they‚Äôll call it, or, the day Davis lost his fucking mind.

\~\*\~

‚ÄúHas he lost his fucking mind,‚Äù Rishi intones. ‚ÄúYou have to be kidding me. A digital grocery store?‚Äù

‚ÄúI am not kidding,‚Äù Samantha hisses, trying to keep her voice down. ‚ÄúYou have to help me talk him out of it.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, fuck him,‚Äù Rishi exclaims. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to waste my time talking him out of it. Goddamnit, I have to start applying for jobs. Tom has the right idea here. We gotta get out.‚Äù

‚ÄúNoo‚Ä¶no, no, no, no, no,‚Äù Samantha pleads. ‚ÄúRishi, I‚Äôm only telling you this because he trusts you. So much! Like, he respects you so, so much! And I honestly think this plan is just a good wake-up call that we need to rethink the core business.‚Äù

‚ÄúUh, yeah, if by rethink you mean evacuate yesterday.‚Äù Rishi has turned his chair away from Samantha and back to his second screen. He‚Äôs on LinkedIn already. He grimaces, unhappy with what he sees. Rishi Balakrishnan is on the older side for Zuby, a septuagenarian at 35. Davis wanted an older CTO, someone who had scaled a SaaS product before, but who wouldn‚Äôt chafe under his habit of nervous micromanagement. Rishi is temperate and wise indeed, as you would be too if you had two sweet daughters and a hefty Redwood City mortgage riding on your job, but Zuby has never found enough customers to make Rishi‚Äôs experience all that relevant.

Samantha groans under her breath and adjusts the perfect waves in her black hair out of nervous habit. She is Zuby‚Äôs COO, and until Sam‚Äôs arrival 9 months ago, she was Davis‚Äô closest confidante and the biggest influence on his thinking. She is 30, and generally perceived by Zuby employees as one of the two ‚Äúadults‚Äù in the room (Rishi being the other). The two have formed an alliance of reasonableness. They arrive early for the weekly C-suite leadership meetings and decide ahead of time which of the two will be the calm one and which of the two will entertain Davis‚Äô increasingly panicked ideas to Save The Company.

Samantha Kim‚Äôs resume is sterling, even better than Davis‚Äô. She went to Yale, worked at Bain, went to the GSB, then worked at Facebook. In other words, she is a coward. She joined Zuby because of an alleged passion for small organic food businesses. It‚Äôs true that while at Facebook, she made 750 granola bars and thought about starting a small organic food business. But ultimately she gave them away at a church bake sale and joined Zuby instead.

Davis is not an idiot. His natural loyalty is to Samantha, who has been invaluable to Davis in a million small ways and a few critical big ones. He is also aware despite all the self-professed admiration, Sam shit-talks him often to friends from Twitter. Whereas Davis has the strong but unprovable impression that Samantha never could, even in the unknowable intimacy of Samantha‚Äôs own home, with her husband who grilled Davis at last year‚Äôs Christmas party and seemed profoundly unimpressed. Samantha is loyal, like Davis. But she is also scared, and increasingly Davis has no use for anyone who is scared.

‚ÄúWhat are you going to say to him at steering?‚Äù Samantha asks Rishi dully.

‚ÄúDoes he know you told me?‚Äù Rishi asks.

‚ÄúUm, I don‚Äôt really care either way, but I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll kick off the meeting by pitching us so...‚Äù Samantha feels a perverse sort of excitement for this momentous upcoming meeting. She is by nature fearful of confrontation, but even she has been aching for relief after months of quiet tension in the office.

‚ÄúThe Sams must have it out,‚Äù Meghan, an ops associate, likes to joke. ‚ÄúWinner keeps their job.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, loser has to stay here,‚Äù her friend Ethan likes to add.

\~\*\~

Okay, let me tell you really quick what Zuby does. Zuby is a specialty food distributor masquerading as a tech company. The company aggregates cool organic/healthy/indie/up-and-coming food brands and tries to distribute them to stores, like coffee shops and shabby organic grocers from Ojai to Highland Park. The dream would be getting major grocery stores to sign up‚Äî Samantha has been personally hounding the buyers at Whole Foods, for instance.

Merchants want cool snacks to sell. Cool snack companies want to be on shelves. Cool snack makers (hands full of organic granola) don‚Äôt have the money or time for sales. Two-sided marketplace, aggregate the long tail, ride a macro trend, ba-da-bing, ba-da-boom, $200m valuation. That‚Äôs where the problem started.

The problem, they discovered, is that no one big will pay for it. The sales team, which by necessity has included Samantha, Sam and Davis himself, has met two types of customers. The first is an extended cousin of their own white-collar, PMC peer group. The college-educated real estate guy who opened a cool coffee shop, the ex-engineer who now makes protein biscuits. They get it, they love it, they sign up for Zuby, then they go out of business rapidly.

Or, if they succeed and stay in the business, they slowly morph into customer type two: a grizzled food guy, a low-margin hustler, bags under their eyes and Zyn in their mouth, uninterested in discussing the future and more interested in discussing whether Zuby will offer a subsidized rate on refrigerated trucking (they will not). They don‚Äôt want to pay, they‚Äôre constantly trying to sneak business off the platform, they trudge up to the Zuby booth at trade shows and swill the free coffee with cynical, deadened eyes before asking about discounts. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be out of business soon, right,‚Äù they always ask, possibly because all they think about every morning is the dark siren call of the void (closing the business and taking a nap).

This is an energizing, fixable challenge for Samantha. This is vaguely concerning background noise to Rishi (who Davis and Samantha gently shield from these realities, as they feel a good CTO deserves). The stagnation is a daily, skull-bruising, brain-shattering pain for Davis.

But he still can‚Äôt bring himself yet to really see Zuby as it is. Behind every half-assed feature he sees the long and arduous compromise to make it exist; every problem speaks only of its possible solutions. But the truth is that Sam the carpetbagger is right. Zuby is hopelessly overvalued. Zuby is going nowhere. Zuby is a wounded, bewildered beast, overfed and huge-bellied, mournful and whipped on all sides to move with speed of which it is no longer capable, to a destination no one can identify. Keen observers regard it with distaste and compassion. Secretly its two largest investors agree it needs to be put down.

‚ÄúWhat do you think they‚Äôre doing in there,‚Äù Ethan asks Meghan. He twitches a pen nervously between his fingers.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you should be so emotionally invested in their meetings,‚Äù Meghan says primly. She is generating an internal report on merchant churn. She and Ethan sit across from each other habitually, and have spent almost a thousand hours in conversation with each other, but only forty-two of those hours have involved direct eye contact. They prefer to keep two laptop screens, twenty-five inches of white desk, and a task and a half between themselves. In one sense, they are best friends. There is no one the other has spoken to more in the past two years. In another sense, neither knows the other‚Äôs middle name.

‚ÄúI think Sam is going to join,‚Äù Ethan forecasts dourly, as he does every week. Sam‚Äôs inclusion in the occasional steering meeting is a real thorn in Ethan‚Äôs side. Ethan is a young, high energy engineer who does half of Rishi‚Äôs work and most of everyone else‚Äôs. Ethan is also burdened with the CTO‚Äôs private, end-of-week grumblings. After Meghan‚Äôs own downloads from Samantha, Ethan and Meghan like to go for a beer and piece together the complaints into a increasingly dire picture of their employer‚Äôs health.

‚ÄúYou cannot honestly be jealous that he takes notes in meetings,‚Äù Meghan says. She is a natural peace-keeper, a real Libra. Her great talent is that she can peaceably digest literally anything the execs want to say‚Äîdire pronouncements, declarations of defeat, 2AM podcast links‚Äî with placid gentleness and produce eight hours later some internal memo or deck that soothes their inflamed hearts. Ethan attributes this preternatural calm to Meghan‚Äôs one great hobby, running marathons. He imagines that she just sweats out all the resentment and pinprick-sharp anxiety that animates him all day. Ethan does not run marathons, he does not even rock climb or urban bike. He has no time, as he is always working.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs an assistant,‚Äù Ethan grumbles. ‚ÄúA glorified assistant that for some reason thinks he‚Äôs better than me. I swear to god if he has 1%‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúOh my god, Ethan,‚Äù Meghan sighs. ‚ÄúI am not checking Carta for you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think he‚Äôs gay,‚Äù Ethan continues conspiratorially. ‚ÄúWhich is fine!‚Äù He hurriedly clarifies, as Meghan finally looks up from her laptop with admonishments ready. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs obviously fine! But it‚Äôs hypocritical, with his politics.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, I actually heard from Lucy that her roommate went to Dartmouth with him. And‚Äî‚Äù

What gossip or defense Meghan could provide was lost to time. At that very moment Sam pushes back from his standing desk (‚ÄùSitting is bad for testosterone levels,‚Äù he says) and enters the steering meeting.

Ethan lets out a muffled yelp of indignation and gets nothing else done that afternoon. He‚Äôll have to stay late instead.

\~\*\~

It‚Äôs 3PM. Inside the conference room, Sam sits on one side of the table, with Rishi and Samantha on the other. As if it‚Äôs an arbitration, Davis sits at the head of the table between them. He drinks a third espresso.

‚ÄúWhat is a digital grocery store‚Ä¶ Like, Instacart?‚Äù Samantha asks slowly.

Sam responds, ‚ÄúNo, the food is digital!‚Äù

Rishi chuckles.

Sam continues, ‚ÄúSo users scan the code on the box. It gives them, like, say, 3 FoodCoin, right? More expensive food, or promotions‚Ä¶ we can adjust on the backend how many FoodCoin you get!‚Äù

Samantha‚Äôs hands dig into the side of her laptop so hard that her fingertips turn white.

Rishi says, ‚ÄúSo it‚Äôs crypto Boxtops?‚Äù

Sam leaps up while everyone else remains seated. ‚ÄúYes! Dude, that‚Äôs such a good line.‚Äù

Samantha speaks slowly, mentally patting the floor around her in search of the sanity that seems to have been dropped fifteen minutes ago. ‚ÄúOk, look. Crypto is kind of controversial. Some VC‚Äôs still like it, but‚Äî‚Äù

Rishi‚Äôs curiosity is irrepressible. Also, at this point, he has already decided to find a new job. ‚ÄúWhat is the FoodCoin for?‚Äù

Sam paces the room like Davis does. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the best part. So you take the FoodCoin and bring it to ZubyMart. And you get digital food.‚Äù This phrase seems to break something in Samantha, who turns her laptop on its side and starts chewing her knuckles.

Rishi asks, ‚ÄúBut what is the digital food for?‚Äù

Sam shrugs. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs like a collectible, or maybe we make a game?‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe we make a game?!‚Äù Samantha thunders. Even Sam‚Äôs eyes grow a little wider. No one at Zuby has seen her like this. Some long-buried gorge is rising in her throat and her eyes spark with new power. ‚ÄúDavis, you cannot possibly be considering this. A pivot at this stage is crazy enough, but‚Ä¶This! Is not even! A reasonable pivot!‚Äù

All eyes turn towards Davis. He is seated at the head of the dead ex-tenant‚Äôs rainbow conference table, his fingers tented and his gaze pointed at no one in the room. His out-of-character silence amidst the chaos gives him a new, ominous air. Who is this guy, Rishi and Samantha think.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to be building,‚Äù Sam says.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been building!‚Äù Samantha shrieks. ‚ÄúYou are not even‚ÄîRishi, please!‚Äù

Rishi shrugs.

‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù Samantha says. ‚ÄúDavis! Come on! This is not, like, responsible behavior.‚Äù

More thoughtful silence.

‚ÄúWhy aren‚Äôt you saying anything!‚Äù

\~\*\~

Here‚Äôs what happened with Davis‚Äô first company. In college, Davis studied electrical engineering and computer science. Studying both is actually pretty rarefied. You might think you know a lot of ‚Äúsoftware engineers‚Äù who can make a website, but you probably don‚Äôt know many genuine¬†*computer scientists.*¬†Davis is the real fucking deal. He invented a protocol that uses sound waves to transmit data. It had been done a few times before, but Davis‚Äô method was the best. Longest distances, worked on really, really old devices, and he packaged it up into the most beautiful, foolproof dev kit. He wanted to use it in disaster zones, Third World countries, places with no wi-fi or phone service. He thought maybe he could be a missionary like his great-grandfather, but with connectivity.

His professor convinced him to explore point-of-sale instead‚Äîpaying phone-to-phone. He dropped out. They raised a seed round. Professor was chairman of the board, Davis was the CEO and the face. Of course this made it easy for the professor to throw Davis under the bus when things went south.

Long story short, apparently the sounds, although inaudible to human ears, drove dogs insane. There were nine bite incidents and three dogs got put down. One bit a kid at Coupa Cafe. Honestly, how could Davis have known? Of course there weren‚Äôt dogs roaming around EE lab during testing. The problem was even fixable, but the PR was not. When Davis was first introduced to Sam, Sam told Davis he thought Wavely had been treated totally unfairly, and three very large beers later Davis was sorrowfully agreeing. ‚ÄúI could have fixed it! I just needed like two months.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Sam had hissed. ‚ÄúImagine holding up human progress over a dog.‚Äù These were suspicious dogs, after all! Smooth-headed, big-skulled pitbulls, bred in backyards and relinquished over and over until they found a home with some soft-hearted oat-milk drinker who blamed Davis for what was probably inevitable!

And ever since, Davis has been trying to win back the industry‚Äôs love, been trying to redeem himself. He shouldn‚Äôt need to. What have all these hecklers ever built? That‚Äôs what Sam said, anyway.

\~\*\~

‚ÄúUh, so, should I start architecting this? What protocol do you want to use?‚Äù

‚ÄúDo all the brands have the same Coin or is it like, one coin per brand?‚Äù

‚ÄúDoes this mean I can stop fixing tickets?‚Äù

‚ÄúAm I going to be fired?‚Äù

Such were the unenlightened questions that mid-level and senior-level employees had as Samantha called them into the room one-by-one, like a late afternoon death march, throwing bodies desperately as random bullet spray in an attempt to win her case. Her fingers are flying across her keyboard as she messages people, arms them with talking points and supportive emojis before they come in.

Samantha‚Äôs plan is this. First off, she knows Davis is not that good at firing people. She figures if she makes him look everyone in the eye‚Äîespecially the mid-level managers he most trusts‚Äîthere‚Äôs no way he‚Äôs going to go through with this insane crypto pivot bullshit.

Secondly, she‚Äôs counting on every person who‚Äôs consulted to agree that, in fact, the idea is bullshit. A Zuby employee is a very timid creature, actually. They are afraid of getting yelled at. They don‚Äôt want anything to be ‚Äútheir fault‚Äù. They like consensus. They like actionable plans. They love a puzzle with a 7 out of 10 difficulty. Zuby has steadily provided a stream of 7/10 difficulty puzzles‚Äîhow to scrape together a list of the fastest growing CPG brands in California, how to make nice UI if every single food category has different tags and specifications, how to de-conflict inventory data across multiple warehouses. The collective deal Zuby employees have made with Davis is that he gets to point them at any 7/10 difficulty puzzle in the world, and they‚Äôll solve it. Just watch them. They‚Äôre lean, whip-smart intellectual thoroughbreds ready to run. But in exchange, Davis must promise that great riches are contingent on this specific set of 7/10 puzzles. Obviously Davis has broken the deal. Zuby has not. This is how Samantha sees things.

Of course, it‚Äôs chaos outside that conference room. Tom, one of the first to be called in, is a medium-level gossiper but a very good boss, and after grimly delivering his verdict‚Äî‚ÄùYeah, this isn‚Äôt working‚Äù‚Äîhe gathers his lieutenants around him to share the dire news of a looming pivot. They sit on the giant carpeted blocks of the building‚Äôs lobby, grim-faced as GIs staring at Normandy. ‚ÄúHow many layoffs, you think?‚Äù one salesman asks Tom. ‚ÄúDeep cuts,‚Äù Tom replies. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna warn my friend.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou do you.‚Äù

By 4:15PM, approximately 97% of Zuby‚Äôs staff is aware that their CEO is contemplating a massive change in the business (1 employee is on maternity leave). No one is working. Clique-ish huddles have formed. One daring young employee is writing ideas on a whiteboard, in case Davis asks him what he thinks the company should do next. Beers are being passed around. A storm brews outside in the blue twilight, making the florescence of the office look even brighter, almost beautiful. It feels like the last day of school.

Meghan steps outside to get some air. In her pocket, her phone buzzes non-stop. It‚Äôs always a jarring transition, where the clean white marble of their building‚Äôs lobby stops, and the urine-soaked concrete outside begins. A summer storm is coming, the air warm and sticky and disgusting. She leans against the building‚Äôs red brick wall. It‚Äôs 5PM, and slackers and South Bay commuters are beginning to trickle out of the offices around them. They‚Äôre identified by shirts, fleeces, messenger bags, all bearing the name of their tribe. Megan ticks off names as they pass‚Äîgoodnight DataCat, goodnight Surmisely, goodnight Airpoint. They are unaware of one of their number laying inside on the operating table, chest open.

Meghan tries to picture losing her job. For a moment it‚Äôs as surreal as stepping into an alternate universe, and in the next moment it‚Äôs utterly quotidien. What is she freaking out about? She can go to grad school. She can write that book. Take time off, travel. Her parents pay her rent. She goes back inside.

\~\*\~

By 7PM the office is mostly empty, and even Ethan has given up eavesdropping and waiting. Davis, Sam and Samantha, and Rishi (though he is mostly playing games on his phone at this point) remain holed up in the conference room. Empty cups and cans overflow from the unlined trash bin. A pizza sits untouched on the table.

‚ÄúNo one thinks this is a good idea,‚Äù Samantha is insisting.

‚ÄúLook, this is ultimately on me, okay?‚Äù Davis says, rubbing his temples. He hasn‚Äôt had any food all day. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my neck on the line. I want to try it.‚Äù

‚ÄúEveryone works here,‚Äù Samantha says acidly. ‚ÄúNot just you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, yes, but for them it‚Äôs a job. For me‚Ä¶I‚Äôm the one who raised the money. I‚ÄîI don‚Äôt mean this in an egotistical way, but we have to bet on my intuition here, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd your intuition is we should make cheddar snacks into crypto bets?‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean, look, it‚Äôs a seed. It‚Äôs exciting! It‚Äôs got‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you say vibes right now, I‚Äôm going to kill you.‚Äù

Sam snorts. Samantha shoots him a glare.

‚ÄúWhy? What‚Äôs wrong with vibes?‚Äù Davis says. ‚ÄúWhy shouldn‚Äôt we just follow vibes instead of‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúInstead of business plans, adult logic‚Ä¶‚Äù

Sam jumps in. ‚ÄúOkay, don‚Äôt be offended, Samantha, but I think‚Ä¶‚Äù He hesitates, or pretends to hesitate. ‚ÄúI think consultant thinking is how we got here to begin with.‚Äù

At this point Samantha, who is missing her niece‚Äôs birthday dinner, grabs Sam‚Äôs Prime and throws it against the wall. Rishi yelps in alarm as it passes him by.

‚ÄúJesus Christ, calm down!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are so fucking disrespectful,‚Äù Samantha yells, yelling for possibly the first time since she‚Äôs been working at Zuby. ‚ÄúWhat do you know about food?‚Äù

‚ÄúOr crypto,‚Äù Rishi comments idly, thumbs twitching away. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gnarly in there right now.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need to know about food,‚Äù Sam shoots back. ‚ÄúI know about the meta. And this is the move.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is nonsense!‚Äù

‚ÄúThis,‚Äù Davis says with great finality. ‚ÄúIs what is happening.‚Äù

This morning? Pure chaos. The kind of chaos that makes you question your life choices before coffee.

So, it rained last night. My kids, filled with the kind of energy that can only come from cartoons and fruit snacks, ran outside the moment the clouds cleared. I swear, they were out there for maybe 45 seconds before the screaming started‚Äîthe dramatic, blood-curdling kind usually reserved for haunted houses and sibling betrayals.

They come barreling back inside yelling, ‚ÄúSNAKES! TWO SNAKES! FROM THE TREE!‚Äù And I? I transformed. No pants. No caffeine. Just me, a half-soggy sleep shirt, and a Swiffer mop. Instant warrior mode. I kicked open the side door like I was auditioning for The Walking Dead: Suburban Snake Edition.

And there they were. Two serpentine demons, clearly plotting the downfall of mankind, entwined like some kind of cursed friendship bracelet, lying in the grass. I charged like a sleep-deprived gladiator, flailing my Swiffer like it was Thor‚Äôs hammer‚Äîbut with way less effectiveness and much more static cling.

Meanwhile, my neighbor is standing calmly with his dog, watching what can only be described as an unhinged woman in a pajama top performing interpretive dance with a mop.

I‚Äôm yelling ‚ÄúSNAKESSSS!!!‚Äù like I‚Äôm in a low-budget action film, and he‚Äîbless him‚Äîhas the audacity to ask, ‚ÄúEverything okay over there?‚Äù

Sir. Do I look okay?

Anyway, after about five dramatic mop smashes, I realize‚Ä¶ nothing is moving. No angry hissing. No slithering. Just two very unbothered ‚Äúsnakes.‚Äù

So I squint (still no caffeine, mind you), lean in‚Ä¶ and right on cue, his dog trots over, grabs the ‚Äúsnakes,‚Äù and proudly returns to his owner.

My neighbor, now clearly trying not to laugh, says, ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ those are just my dog‚Äôs rope toys.‚Äù

My kids picked the exact moment he threw it to decide to go outside, and voil√†: suburban horror movie.

So now I‚Äôve got grass in my hair, Swiffer battle fatigue, and the local reputation of being That Neighbor Who Attacks Dog Toys Before Breakfast.

I looked out the window,  
Rain hittin‚Äô the glass,  
Thought I saw your shadow  
Walkin‚Äô right past.  
Coffee‚Äôs gone cold,  
TV‚Äôs on mute,  
But my mind won‚Äôt quit  
Runnin‚Äô back to you.

Tried to move on,  
But I keep lookin‚Äô back.

Puts me off track.  
You were the calm,  
You were the spark‚Äî  
Now it‚Äôs just me  
Alone in the dark.

Saw pieces of us,  
In the light, in the sky,  
In the back of a bus.  
I‚Äôm still here,  
Still stuck in the blue‚Äî  
Yeah, I looked out the window,  
And all I saw was you.

I walked through the city,  
Heard your laugh in the crowd,  
But it faded too quick,  
Like smoke in a cloud.  
I talk like I‚Äôm fine,  
But that ain‚Äôt true,  
Every ""I‚Äôm okay""  
Still leads back to you.

Thinkin‚Äô ‚Äôbout nothin‚Äô

You were the light,  
You were the flame‚Äî  
Now it‚Äôs just silence  
When I call your name.

This morning? Pure chaos. The kind of chaos that makes you question your life choices before coffee.

So, it rained last night. My kids, filled with the kind of energy that can only come from cartoons and fruit snacks, ran outside the moment the clouds cleared. I swear, they were out there for maybe 45 seconds before the screaming started‚Äîthe dramatic, blood-curdling kind usually reserved for haunted houses and sibling betrayals.

They come barreling back inside yelling, ‚ÄúSNAKES! TWO SNAKES! FROM THE TREE!‚Äù And I? I transformed. No pants. No caffeine. Just me, a half-soggy sleep shirt, and a Swiffer mop. Instant warrior mode. I kicked open the side door like I was auditioning for The Walking Dead: Suburban Snake Edition.

And there they were. Two serpentine demons, clearly plotting the downfall of mankind, entwined like some kind of cursed friendship bracelet, lying in the grass. I charged like a sleep-deprived gladiator, flailing my Swiffer like it was Thor‚Äôs hammer‚Äîbut with way less effectiveness and much more static cling.

Meanwhile, my neighbor is standing calmly with his dog, watching what can only be described as an unhinged woman in a pajama top performing interpretive dance with a mop.

I‚Äôm yelling ‚ÄúSNAKESSSS!!!‚Äù like I‚Äôm in a low-budget action film, and he‚Äîbless him‚Äîhas the audacity to ask, ‚ÄúEverything okay over there?‚Äù

Sir. Do I look okay?

Anyway, after about five dramatic mop smashes, I realize‚Ä¶ nothing is moving. No angry hissing. No slithering. Just two very unbothered ‚Äúsnakes.‚Äù

So I squint (still no caffeine, mind you), lean in‚Ä¶ and right on cue, his dog trots over, grabs the ‚Äúsnakes,‚Äù and proudly returns to his owner.

My neighbor, now clearly trying not to laugh, says, ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ those are just my dog‚Äôs rope toys.‚Äù

My kids picked the exact moment he threw it to decide to go outside, and voil√†: suburban horror movie.

So now I‚Äôve got grass in my hair, Swiffer battle fatigue, and the local reputation of being That Neighbor Who Attacks Dog Toys Before Breakfast.

At least I didn‚Äôt spill my coffee.
Oh wait‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt have coffee.",14,1750213978.0,Mommit,6,1.0,False

Ever since we found out, my girlfriend has acted so different. She acts like I have glass bones and paper skin. We're both very touchy people, and we used to cuddle all the time. Every night she'd fall asleep basically on top of me. Now she'll apologize if she accidentally rests her arm on me. 

She also doesn't let me take care of her anymore. Before, I made her breakfast and coffee every morning, packed her a lunch, and made dinner. I love treating her like a princess. But she won't let me anymore. I hate her taking care of me. Most days I can't even get out of bed, so I kind of understand why she takes care of me. But I just miss her being herself. She seems so down lately, I really feel like it's my fault.

Anyway, this kind of just turned into a very sad rant. But how do I make her treat me like she used to? Or is that even possible? I don't know if I have much time left, I really don't want to spend my last few months being treated like I can't do anything. Even though I really can't.

To cut to the chase, he was installing two rooms of crown molding in what is commonly called a ""2 piece"" (basically a flat board to increase the profile then followed by the crown). He invited me into one of the rooms to see how it looked as I was trying to stay away from hovering and/or interfering. As I looked around the room all looked okay until I caught that in a blank space above the first piece in which he wrote the date, the name of his firm and then the words: ""XXXX IS A MORON"". Now XXXX here is the name of a U.S. President.¬† ¬†

Now I am not going to say if it is our current president or a former one as that should not be germane to the issue (but since it will be asked by Redditors, the name was of a president I support/supported). I did not say anything to the contractor as I feared him by this point.¬† He was virtually finished, and this was one of the last pieces to nail in.¬† The second piece of crown molding hides the words. But it is killing me up inside. I should not have been a coward and asked him to remove it, but I didn't. I was afraid of the confrontation and just wanted him out. But I can‚Äôt live with this so I either must hire someone else, ask a family member to help me out or insist he come back.¬† And I question if he did this at other points along the way but I only saw the last scribbles.¬† I want those words that I did see under the molding gone.¬† I do not mind him signing his work with the date (or even writing something silly like ‚ÄúKilroy was here""). But it is the political statement he felt he could make that infuriates me.¬† He crossed a boundary. I feel violated.

I want to add there was absolutely no discussion of politics or divisive issues. I offered a cup of coffee, turned on the air conditioning to make it comfortable to work and discussed a common hobby for a bit before he started his work. I paid a hefty sum for his and his sons 3 hours of work and there are a few quality issues. But it is the passive-aggressive and boundary crossing that is the issue here.¬† I am considering writing to him to see if he would like to offer a solution and most importantly, an apology.¬† I anticipate it will not go well.

So, Reddit what do you think?¬† Should I just go ahead and post negative reviews or give him a chance to do the right thing and sincerely apologize to me?¬† He will absolutely know it is me posting the review and I must admit I fear doing that as well.

I seriously cannot believe that as a nation we have sunk this low. Until now, the political landscape, while very, very important to me, suddenly turned personally vicious and hit close to home. I now know more than ever that we have crossed a point of no return.

Background info: we've been friends for about two years now, and we've visited each other's houses, but only once each. I'd say that we're ""close"", but we don't really hang out that much besides in our shared extracurricular (band). I'd want the outing to be something interesting enough that it makes sense to invite him out to randomly, so things like coffee or a hike probably wouldn't work that well. A movie might work, but I don't know a lot about his tastes in movies, and there's nothing that interesting out right now that we haven't already watched seprately. He has some social anxiety stuff as well, so a place with too many people or relative overwhelming behavior wouldn't work (public places are fine, I'm just talking places like fairgrounds and clubs probably would be a bad idea).

So my son is 10.5 months old, has been EBF, and has coslept with me since birth. I believe he‚Äôs had some silent reflux issues that have mostly resolved. He has woken up about every 1-2 hours almost every night since birth for comfort. I have compartmentalized this and compensated with coffee and prayer lol. I don‚Äôt allow myself to dwell on my lack of sleep because when I say I tried everything except for medication for reflux, I seriously mean it. He goes right back to sleep after latching so I know it is a sleep association. 

However, for some reason 2 weeks ago I decided to try laying him down in the crib for his first nap. He did amazing, like woke up when I laid him down and put himself back to sleep. So I kept on with that and now he takes both naps in his crib. Sleeps 3.5 hrs per day for naps. Goes to sleep between 8/9p, wakes between 7/8a. (Again, with waking very often and needing to latch). 

I have put him in the crib at the start of the night and he wakes up 45mins later upset. I just put him in to bed with me at that point. I‚Äôm trying to do this slowly.

Yep, it's beans and weiners time now that summers rolling in! A 2020 menu #1!

1st pic is the star of the show, the beans and weiners! I added some crushed red pepper and apparently a ""blurry"" filter too! Sorry about that. 

This dish was great! You may think it's sweet, but this is actually more savory than sweet. The weiners are like sliced hot dogs, but here's the thing, these are quality weiners. Put the 4 Fingers of Death US MRE out of your mind, these weiners are far superior. 

Pics 2-3 show packaging and contents; a nice little spread for sure!

Pic 4 is that ever present ""Canadian beach towel"", bask in its glory!

Pics 5-6 are that amazingly sweet, moist, and delicious cornbread. Trust me on this, there is nothing wrong with this cornbread, it's fantastic.  In this case, I topped it with the strawberry jam, paired very well. I used the chocolate PB in a US FSR caffeinated chocolate pudding, boy was that yummy too!

Pic 7 shows the Tropical Fruit Salad and the Wildberry Crunchy Cereal. Now, this may look ""normal"", but here's where I went a little waffelly, I actually used the juice from the fruit to recon that cereal!!!! Wow! What a flavor bomb that was!!!

Grape drinks were great, 3 in 1 coffee wonderful in a protein shake, and the Xact Protein bar was eaten by one of my kiddos as they are not my favorite IMP item. I did not use the Tobasco here, as I opted for the crushed red pepper instead.

Conclusion: a great IMP and I encourage others to try one!

I've been on this subreddit before but not much luck. Unfortunately most messages have about as much substance as the people behind them. I'm looking for long term friends and actual connections but I know that's a bit of a loaded request on here. I'm hoping we have things in common to talk about. A bit about me is I'm quite introverted. I enjoy a lot of quiet, creative hobbies like reading and journaling. I like old sitcoms and cartoons, I'm not huge on anime but I do read a few mangas. A quiet and slower lifestyle. I love visiting libraries, coffee shops, bookstores, thrift stores. It's a bit hard to find others like me because they're usually all hiding the same. I do love spending time with someone while just doing our own things, the company is very nice. I'll match your energy when it comes to messaging, I love to chat but I am shy at first. I'm pretty easy going but I am a bit of an old lady compared to most. I hope you know how to carry a conversation or show interest in it. If you're looking for a short conversation, I probably won't be a fun chat. Something a bit different to my other hobbies is I love paranormal and supernatural topics. I have some pretty odd, spiritual beliefs before we get to the conversation. I enjoy some video games but not huge on it. I love COD zombies, RDR2, Minecraft, The Sims, Infinity Nikki, and some others. I hope your message is a bit more than just a hi, hello. I'm 27 from Cali, open to anyone but keep it sfw. It would be great to make some girl friends, I hope I can find other women looking for genuine friends. It would be great if you're within a 6-8 hr time difference so its not so difficult but if we can make good friends, I'm sure we can make it work!

Here are some icebreakers:

* What do you enjoy watching?
* Do you believe in anything paranormal or supernatural?
* Do you collect anything?
* What's a deal breaker for you in a friendship?
* How do you like spending your time?
* Do you have any pets?",0,1750213511.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,2,0.5,False
