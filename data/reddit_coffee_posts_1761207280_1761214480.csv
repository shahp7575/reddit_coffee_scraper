1odzel2,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentSecrets/comments/1odzel2/secrets_before_the_exam/,Secrets before the exam,"There are many things you can do before an exam to help you prepare well for your exams. 

The more you do to prepare for an exam beforehand, the better you will feel during the exam. Follow our tips in this section and let us know if you have more study tips to share.

# Notes

* Keep your notes tidy and complete. If you miss a class, get the notes from a friend or ask your teacher what you missed.
* Organise your notes into different sections, e.g. vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, speaking, reading, listening, writing. This will make it easier to find the section you need to revise for the exam.
* Look through your notes regularly, not just the day before the exam.
* Use different coloured pens and highlighter pens to help you focus on the most important things you have to learn.
* Make summaries of your notes. Include the most important things in your summaries. Write short summaries on small cards that you can carry around with you and read them on the bus or when you have some free time.
* Make mind maps, visuals and diagrams.
* If you don’t understand something in your notes, ask a classmate or your teacher to explain it to you.

# Time

Many students have lots of exams close together. It is useful to plan how much time you have to revise and make a revision timetable.

# What’s a revision timetable?

Work out how much time you have to study each subject and complete a table or grid with the subjects you are going to study and when you are going to study them. Try to stick to your revision timetable to make sure you have enough time to do everything.

Don’t leave your revision until the last minute. Try to revise for each exam more than once to help you learn things well. Our long term memories remember more if we look at things more than once so look at your notes regularly.

Remember to take regular breaks while you study. Take a 15-minute break after every hour you study. This will help you concentrate during your study time.

# Phones and other distractions

If you and your friends send each other messages every five minutes, you will find it very difficult to concentrate on what you are learning. So, switch off your phone and your favourite social network sites while you are studying! You can send messages to your friends during your breaks.

# Music

Some people like listening to music when they study and it can help them concentrate. But if music distracts you, turn it off while you study or listen to music without words. Listen to your favourite music during your breaks. Try studying with music on and without music, to see how you study better. You might find that a certain type of music helps your concentration. 

# Brain food

It’s really important to eat properly while studying for exams. A healthy diet will give you lots of energy. Sugary snacks like sweets and chocolate may give you short-term energy, but it is better to eat foods that give you lots of energy over a longer period of time. Check out our list of brain foods and try to make sure your diet includes lots of these things during exam times.

# Super brain foods:

* brown bread
* cereals
* pasta
* rice
* beans, lentils and chickpeas
* oily fish such as sardines, tuna or salmon
* shellfish
* red meat
* chicken
* cheese
* eggs
* fresh fruit
* vegetables
* salads

Eat regular, healthy snacks while you’re studying as well as three good meals a day to keep your energy levels high.

# Exercise

Do plenty of physical exercise while you are studying for exams. Exercise helps oxygen move around your body and your brain needs lots of oxygen to work well. Go outside for a walk and get some fresh air, go for a swim or meet your friends for a game of football.

# Look after your eyes

Spend your study time in a quiet room with plenty of light. If you study better in the evenings, make sure you have a good lamp so that your eyes don’t get tired. Do exercises for your eyes. Look at something near you and blink (open and close) your eyes several times and then look at something far away. Repeat this several times.

# Revise with a friend

Talking through what you have learned with a friend can help you remember things. You can also test each other and explain things to each other when one of you doesn’t understand. It can be more fun revising with a friend.

# Early bird or night owl?

It’s good to know when you learn better. Some people study better in the morning (early birds) and others in the afternoon or evening (night owls). Plan your study time when you feel at your best and feel wide awake!

# Sleep

The best food for the brain is sleep, so you’ll need a lot of sleep during exam times. When you’re tired you will find it difficult to concentrate and learn.

So, how much sleep do you need? Well, when you’ve had the right amount of sleep you don’t feel tired, not too much and not too little. Most teenagers need between 8 and 9 hours sleep a night.

Try and get good quality sleep. So, don’t sleep with your books all over your bed or with lights, music or the computer on. For the best sleep, make sure your room is quiet, comfortable and dark.

If you stay up late studying and don’t get enough sleep, you may need a ‘power nap’ in the afternoon. A short sleep of 30 minutes may give you some energy before you start revising, but keep it short – you don’t want to spend all afternoon in bed!

# Tips to help you sleep

* Have a regular bed time. Try to go to bed at the same time every night, if possible 8 or 9 hours before you have to wake up.
* Do plenty of exercise. Don’t do exercise just before bedtime, but regular exercise earlier in the day can help your body sleep at night.
* Don’t drink caffeine (colas, tea or coffee) in the afternoons and evenings. Drink water, fruit juices or herbal teas.
* Have a milky drink just before bedtime.
* Relax before you go to bed. When you have finished studying, read a book, listen to music, watch TV or have a bath to help you relax.
* Turn off lights, your computer, mobile and any other electrical devices in your room.
* When you wake up, open the curtains to get lots of natural light in your room. This will help you feel more awake in the morning.",1,1761214231.0,StudentSecrets,0,1.0,False

1odzber,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDUK/comments/1odzber/saving_money_at_a_completely_loss/,Saving Money - At a completely loss.,"I’ve never been great with money. I was in significant debt but over Covid and moving in with family I was able to pay it off and save up some monies. 

I used this money to pay for doing a masters degree. Which has positioned me into a better position for a decently paid job - I’m earning the most I’ve ever made but I’m still not able to put any monies in savings. 

I never miss any bills, I don’t have any significant debt (£70 in a Monzo flex) when I’m paid I divid my money into pots ie. Bills, food, petrol, house  - and then try and put a tiny bit towards savings and then for “fun” and other things like toiletries or like an odd meal out. 

I’ve made comprehensive budgeting plans on excel. I literally track every penny but still I can’t seem to control my spending. 

I don’t really care about designer things, don’t get my nail or beauty treatments, wfh so rarely get a mid week coffee etc. if I do buy stuff I love vinted and getting a bargain. I’d say amazon is a bad habit, where I’ll get something in my head - then order it knowing it arrives tomorrow. 

I just feel like any monies I put towards savings end up being used by the end of the month. 

Any advise. Did anything help you curb your spending? Do you have any recommendations for earning extra monies? I’m just feeling sooo deflated by how little monies I have.

I’m looking to see if there are any poker enthusiasts around the Baner region who’d be up for playing tonight or later this week.

• We can pick a comfortable spot in or around Baner (coffee lounge / home / club) depending on what everyone’s okay with.

If you’re interested, drop a comment or DM and we’ll coordinate location/time.

1odz3o8,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1odz3o8/hf_nietzsches_cotton_enlightenment/,[HF] Nietzsches Cotton Enlightenment,"**Nietzsche’s Cotton Enlightenment**  

Friedrich Nietzsche awoke in a Leipzig dumpster, coughing out sauerkraut fumes and existential dread. His mustache—still magnificent after 134 years—itched with the sweat of modern mediocrity. “*Gott ist tot*?” he muttered, peeling a pizza box off his frock coat. “No, *I* was dead! And this…” He gestured at the neon-lit street where slack-jawed youths photographed their *Schnitzel* for *das Internet*, “…is the Übermensch? Pathetic!”  

He stumbled into a 24-hour *Apotheke*, seeking aspirin for his temporal dislocation headache. Behind the counter, a skeletal clerk in *Joy Division* tee offered salvation: “Try Benzedrex, *Alter*. Clears sinuses… and nihilism.” Nietzsche squinted at the inhaler’s label—*Propylhexedrine*. “A stimulant for the *weak*?” he scoffed. But despair outweighed pride. He ripped open the plastic, devoured the cotton strip inside like communion wafer.  

Chemical lightning struck.  

Three days later, Nietzsche paced a Berlin squat, pupils blown wide as Schopenhauer’s pessimism. He’d rewritten *Beyond Good and Evil* on the walls using blacklight markers:  
> *“MORALITY IS A BENZEDREX COMEDOWN! WEAKLINGS INVENT ETHICS TO EXCUSE THEIR LACK OF AMPHETAMINE COURAGE!”*  

His landlord, a vegan anarchist named Lars, knocked. “Friedrich, man… the neighbors complain about screaming.” Nietzsche whirled, eyes blazing. “SCREAMING? I AM *LAUGHING* AT YOUR ‘POST-MODERNITY’! You quote *Zarathustra* on Tinder bios while scrolling Instagram! You seek ‘authenticity’?!” He jabbed a finger at Lars’s *Che Guevara* tattoo. “Authenticity requires *chemically stripping the ego*! Observe!”  

He swallowed three more Benzedrex cottons dry. Lars fled.  

By dawn, Nietzsche had live-tweeted the death of God (again) to 12 followers, invented “Dionysian Crypto,” and composed a punk opera titled *Eternal Recurrence of the Same Damn Netflix Show*. He burst into a Kreuzberg coffee shop, soaked in sweat and prophetic fury:  

“YOU!” he roared at baristas crafting oat-milk lattes. “You build ‘safe spaces’ while your souls atrophy! Where is the *will to power*? Not in hashtags! Not in artisanal toast!” He slammed a fist on the counter. “It’s *here*!” He produced al fistful of Benzedrex inhalers. “Swallow the cotton! Taste the abyss! Become the *Über-Droge*!”  

Police dragged him away, still shouting: “MODERN MAN ISN’T *ÜBER*—HE’S JUST *TWEAKED*!”  

At the station, Nietzsche grinned through the holding cell bars. Propylhexedrine sang in his veins. The eternal return wasn’t a philosophical trap—it was a *binge cycle*. He licked the last cotton shred from his teeth. Humanity remained a disappointment… but oh, the *comedown* would be legendary.  


**Chapter 2: The Dionysian Downspiral**

The Berlin police holding cell smelled like stale *Currywurst* and existential surrender—a far cry from the crisp Alpine air Nietzsche remembered. His Benzedrex-fueled euphoria had curdled into a jittery, jaw-grinding comedown. Across the cell, a tattooed meth cook named Klaus offered wisdom through broken teeth: ""First rule of tweak, *Philosoph*? Never eat the *last* cotton. Always save one for the morning piss.""  

Nietzsche ignored him, pacing the three-meter span like a caged panther. His mind raced with fragmented revelations:  
*Modernity’s great lie? Calling convenience ""freedom.""*  
*Twitter is just the eternal recurrence of bad opinions.*  
*Why do anarchists always smell like patchouli and defeat?*  

A bored public defender arrived, flipping through Nietzsche’s file. ""Friedrich N.... Says here you assaulted a vegan café with... *stimulant inhalers*?""  

""Assaulted?"" Nietzsche barked, his voice raw from 72 hours of declaiming. ""I offered transcendence! They clutched their oat milk like chalices of cowardice!""  

The lawyer sighed. ""They’re pressing charges. ‘Chemical evangelism.’ Also, you bit a barista.""  

""A necessary demonstration!"" Nietzsche insisted. ""His ‘fair trade’ ethics dissolved when confronted with *real* power dynamics! I showed him the abyss—he screamed for almond syrup!""  

Klaus chuckled. ""Shoulda bit *me*, *Kumpel*. My blood’s 80% battery acid.""  

The lawyer slid a plea deal across the metal table: *6 months rehab, mandatory therapy.* Nietzsche recoiled as if handed poison. ""*Therapy*? To cure *what*? Seeing reality clearly? Modern man isn’t sick—he’s *bored*! He medicates with Netflix and avocado toast while his soul rots!""  

""Sign it,"" the lawyer droned. ""Or it’s 18 months in Moabit Prison. They banned philosophy books there last Tuesday.""  

Nietzsche snatched the pen. Not to sign—to scrawl on the form’s margins:  
> *""HE WHO FIGHTS WITH DRUGS SHOULD BEWARE, LEST HE THEREBY BECOME A PHARMACIST. AND IF THOU GAZE LONG INTO THE BENZEDREX, THE BENZEDREX WILL ALSO GAZE INTO THEE.""*  

He shoved it back. ""Tell your judges: I *am* rehab! The last honest man in a world of smiling nihilists!""

Since the coffee tastes great, I’ve not tried varying the extraction time, but I wonder if others have experimented along these lines.  If so, what effects on flavor did you observe from shorter and longer extraction times?

I had ordered an Aeropress flow control cap which was accepted and the very next day a refund was initiated by the seller without me cancelling it. 

Their given phone number is not reachable, their WhatsApp chat person stopped responding to me. 

While I got my refund, this experience was sour as I live in a well serviceable area and the product is still available on their website.

In my case, I spent all day monitoring news and chat awaiting the Odyssey release. It dropped precisely on time and after an hour of Steam glitches I got it to run and started a The Gravship run.  Basically iron man but I reloaded a few times for the ship room corner vacuum bug. 

I played for 52 hours without sleeping, eating at the computer and stepping away only when necessary. I used tea, coffee and leaf to stave off approaching blackouts and stopped only when I forgot how to read (the feeling like when you half-wake up at night and can't understand the numbers on the clock, but persistent). 

The sleep deprivation and darkness outside, combined with the eerie music and isolated tone of the orbital locations, generated a creepy dark side of the moon vibe that was both chilling and exhilarating.  I claim this is a near optimal way to enjoy those sections. I think Ludeon did a fantastic job combining the music, muffled sound effects and stark desaturated color scheme to build a mood that is remote, lonely but beautiful. 

Ironically I couldn't finish the main quest because I left the Cerebrex platform, intending to come back when I had more armor. The release version of Odyssey had a bug that made the platform disappear if you left it, making the mech quest unfinishable. Eventually I realized this and gave up, and slept for 16 hours. 

Which means I will get to try this marathon again when I have the time. 


That was 52 hours with at least 12 hours of release news obsession beforehand. Surely that cannot be the longest Rimworld marathon.

I picked up my order and sat in the corner. There was a wall behind me and to my right, and in front of me was a huge floral decoration, blocking my view. Only the left side was open, and shortly after, a woman sat there with a child (she was probably over 30, the child was maybe 7).  Anyway, I was sitting there reading  comic, but then I noticed this woman glancing at me. Oookay, a little weird, but I didn't think much of it. 

  
The thing is, after a while (about 20 pages later), the woman got up and walked over to me. Like, she stood over me for a moment, no talk. And I have to say: I'm quite awkward and don't like confrontation, and I easily miss certain signals, so yes, I immediately got nervous and started looking around. My thoughts went to ""maybe her kid dropped something and it landed here?"" But then she said something like ""aren't you embarrassed?"" and it confused me even more.  I tried to ask her what was going on, but she pointed to my comic and started saying I shouldn't read it in a public place. Then she pointed at her son and started complaining that there were minors in the space and I was being irresponsible. She was quite loud, so staff quickly came over and then two staff members asked her to calm down, she tried to blame me, they asked her again not to shout, and she went to her table, took her son and left. 



When I got home, I wrote about it to my friends (27F, 26F, 29M, 24M, 25F) because I still didn't fully understand what had happened and why, but... when I told them about it, they said ""well, the woman could have been nicer, but you really shouldn't have brought that comic  to public space. Kind of asshole move."". But I'm not sure if they right? Like,  the cover of this comic (the only thing this woman could see from her seat) simply features a man smoking a cigarette. He's dressed. The background is normal. The title is very tame,  it literally sounds more like a slice of life or a comedy.  The ""+18"" tag is on the back cover and is tiny, you can barely see this. So, like, you have to know this title to know that it even has erotic scenes. 



But my friends still disagreed with me and said that what I did was a little weird and now I just don't know :/ did I really do something wrong?",1,1761212648.0,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,0,1.0,False

I’m a 26M from France, working in Riga since September. My job kept me really busy, so I haven’t had much time to make friends until now. I’d really like to meet new people!

I speak a bit of English (not perfectly, but I get by 😅) and I’d love either to meet Latvians to learn more about the culture, or to practice my English with other expats.

Fun fact: I even learned how to play novuss (still not very good at it, lol).

I’m pretty open to doing anything — coffee, a walk, drinks, games, or just hanging out. If anyone’s interested, feel free to reach out!

1odyvxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1odyvxg/resonable_footsteps_from_upstairs_sound_like_a/,Resonable footsteps from upstairs sound like a bouncing basketball?,"Partner and I bought a converted London garden flat, did it up and moved in a few months ago. Everything about it is absolutely perfect, except noise insulation from upstairs.

I’m a light, anxious sleeper with a family history of insomnia. My mother has it extremely bad and has to take a cocktail of pills on rotation. The upstairs is carpeted in the bedrooms and we sleep directly under a couple, with kids in the other bedroom. We don’t hear much noise from the TV or the crying/screaming from the bedrooms, but what we do hear is a lot of impact noise. We hear them walk around which sounds like someone bouncing a ball on our ceiling, as though they’re rushing around while wearing hiking boots (which we know is not the case). In the living room and corridor that is not carpeted, the steps vibrate the ceilings and all the fixtures on it. My partner has deduced that it’s the way they walk, putting their heels down firmly with every step, and when they invited us up for a coffee a few weeks ago we confirmed that at least the father walks in a specific manner that is louder than usual. When he walks down the stairs, it sounds horrific (if anyone has seen the first Harry potter movie, it’s like Dudley stomping down the stairs above Harry’s cupboard). We hear their kids run around during the day and in the early mornings on weekends. If we’re lucky, they will walk around between 6 and 8am and are usually out of the house by 8, but at that point I’m so riled I up I don’t fall asleep. 7:30 is when we get up for work, but being awake at 6 on weekends is ridiculous for us. Every so often, when I’m falling asleep, I will hear them drop something that’s probably a phone or a wardrobe hanger, but it gives me a literal jump scare and activates my anxiety and fight or flight, on the look out for the next noise.

I already wear earplugs, but if I wake up at 5am and happen to hear a noise from above, my cortisol kicks in and I don’t fall asleep again. We have tried white noise and brown noise from a speaker but my partner says it’s way too loud and can’t sleep (he is a heavy sleeper and sleeps through all noises except apparently white noise) so he had to turn it off in the middle of the night. He’s also worried the upstairs will complain about the noise. Sleeping in separate rooms isn’t possible, and the other room is under the kids and is incredibly loud as you hear them throw toys around and jump about. 

We’ve talked to them about it before and they said that they already try to keep it down, and we know that they don’t intentionally stomp around. We can’t insulate or drop the ceiling height, so I’m more looking for advice to better my mental health and anxiety so I can sleep through it and not get so triggered. It’s a regular flat noise. I haven’t slept for more than 6 hours in the last few months, and it’s really really heavily affecting my work (I work with patients). Due to salary and work constraints, a flat is all we can afford here, and we’re not able to really diy any noise panels to damped the sounds, and got a quote from a builder and we can’t afford that. The ceiling in our bedroom also has intricate coving and rose details we’d lose. 

Any advice? 

Edit: I get a day off once every few weeks, and when I’m at home I can hear the couple (they both work from home permanently) walk around and move every minute of the day. How do you even get work done if you’re constantly doing something?!
I’ve tried this thing where you try and sympathise with them or understand they’re just human (the kids aren’t the problem, mainly the couple that walks around at random times at night), but unfortunately we had run into issues with them in the past (leak where the ignored us for weeks, they put in the wrong address for deliveroo so they’d buzz our door and we have to bring up the food, happened 7 times until one day we weren’t in and they were forced to change address) and they don’t seem like very nice people, which is really sucky because I’m sure I’d feel a little better about noise if they were good nice neighbours… ",1,1761212337.0,HousingUK,1,1.0,False

I’ve always found myself vibing better with women who are a bit more mature - confident, grounded, with stories, humour, and depth that younger energy rarely matches.

I’m in my late 20s, easygoing, respectful, and love genuine conversations - whether it’s over coffee, a walk, or just late-night chats that flow naturally. I’m not chasing drama or playing games -  just looking for that relaxed connection that feels real and effortless.

If you’re someone who enjoys good conversation, good company, and the idea of an occasional catch-up - I'd love to hear from you

Let’s see where good energy takes us.

1odyu83,https://www.reddit.com/r/JobXDubai/comments/1odyu83/been_using_browserbased_calling_for_international/,Been using browser-based calling for international calls - here's what actually works,"After spending way too much on international calls through my carrier, I switched to browser-based VoIP services and the difference is significant.

**What browser calling actually means:**

You go to a website, log in, and make calls directly from your browser. No app downloads, no software installation. Just open the site and dial.

**Cost difference is real:**

My carrier: $2.50/minute to India Traditional calling card: $0.50/minute Browser VoIP services: $0.02-$0.10/minute depending on destination

I was paying $75/month for maybe 30 minutes of international calling. Now I pay $5-10 and get way more talk time.

**How it works:**

Sign up (takes literally 2 minutes) Add credit (usually $5-20 minimum) Dial the number Call uses your internet connection, reaches regular phone networks They hear their phone ring normally, no app needed on their end

**Quality:**

Surprisingly good on decent internet. HD voice on most services. Occasionally drops if your connection is bad, but that's rare. Definitely better than the echo-y calling cards from back in the day.

**Practical advantages:**

Works anywhere with internet (home, coffee shop, office) No phone plan needed - just internet Can use on any device with a browser Most services show exact cost before you dial No monthly fees, just pay for what you use Credit doesn't expire (on most platforms)

**Downsides:**

You need stable internet (WiFi preferred) Some countries have weird regulations Not ideal for emergencies (stick to regular phone for that) Number might show as ""Unknown"" or international to recipient

**Services I've tried:**

Several platforms offer this - BubblyPhone, BrowserCalls, ZippCall, etc. Features are pretty similar across them. Main differences are rates to specific countries and interface preferences.

**Is it worth it?**

If you make regular international calls: absolutely. If you call once a year: probably not worth setting up. If you're traveling: way better than roaming charges.

The browser-based approach is convenient because I don't need to install anything on work computers or when using public/borrowed devices. Just log in and call.

Anyone else using these services? What's been your experience with call quality and rates?

You all okay?,"Went to a Starbucks for the first time in a while. It's a location I've been to. Same thing as last time: I went with a friend after the morning rush, get a simple drink, and sit around for a bit talking. I think the decor had changed. Or maybe the local fast food remodels to look more cozy just make it looks colder. The place was tense. 

This time my friend changed his mind part way through and added some pauses. It took what I'd call a mildly annoying time to order 1 drink. 30 seconds maybe. I am used to this, because my wife decides what to order as she starts talking. It drives me insane, but people are always polite and patient because it's a few seconds. The guy behind the counter looked like he was about to lose his cool. Like he was turning red and doing the pee pee dance. Once we're done he storms off and starts angrily flipping things around like he's the only bartender at a crowded club on a Friday. Didn't even watch us pay.

Fast forward like 1 minute and one of the employees is yelling at the other over an order that isn't done, and I assume it's ours. This asshole berates the other for an uncomfortable amount of time, nitpicking all the things they're doing wrong, including taking a couple steps to get something instead of getting it all at once. Since I'm being subjected to this, I decided to participate. I walked up and shouted, ""HEY!"" Everyone froze and looked at me. I said, ""You're making me uncomfortable with this criticism. I'm in no rush, just be nice to each other."" He apologized, but mumbled, ""It's not yours, it's a mobile order. They make us go fast."" I look around the empty restaurant and then at the empty drivethrough lot making a big sweeping gesture. ""They don't care"" was all he said before he turned his back to make drinks. As I walked away I said, ""Just chill out, no one wants to be talked to like that. And I don't want to listen to it."" My friend was embarrassed by me, so probably I was more of an asshole than I'm making myself sound.

Friend's cup had some kind of hieroglyphics on it. Mine had a simple, ""Thank you your awesome."" So obviously I rushed back there to give them a grammar lesson they'd never forget. Nah JK. My friend informed me Starbucks employees ""have to"" write on each cup now, which I did not know. Wow, 5 minutes in and I've encountered WAY too many references to forcing employees to do things. Why? I haven't been able to get a clear answer. Or at least I haven't been able to get an answer that didn't sound like ChatGPT responses to desperate queries like, ""How do I, a human, connect with my customers, who are fellow humans?"" It legit feels like an insult to my intelligence to think I can be manipulated like that. That also sucks for baristas who are trying to be sincere.

Oh, and the mobile order they rushed out sat around for like 20 minutes before someone showed up to get it. Customer was lovely and she gave 0 shits that it was room temp. KPI achieved, I guess?

Okay **TLDR**: Are they making you speed run these drinks for people who aren't even there? Are they clocking you? Please tell me you don't have to log the time on every order. It's insane. And if we're stressing on the speed, *why in the fuck* are we writing on each cup? Does no one realize how fake it feels when it's a corporate initiative? Or do they think customers are just incredibly stupid? Are you all this stressed, or is it just that location? Because I cannot imagine working in an environment with so much stress around something as stupid as how many seconds it takes to get someone coffee. 

If any of you reading this scold co-workers for taking a couple steps, stop being a dick. Coming to this sub to learn about layoffs makes me sad for you, but maybe it's not so bad. If this is common, I hope you're all well and can find a different place to work or a way to avoid internalizing the environment.",0,1761211904.0,starbucks,4,0.5,False

Intro

Creating a worthy sequel to the much loved Dragon Age: Inquisition is a very lofty goal, especially if your last two games were high profile disasters. With three games of beautifully crafted lore and one of the best cliffhangers in gaming history behind it there was a real possibility Bioware could heal the wounds of the past and not only revive but rejuvenate the company into the AAA creative force they once were. Ten long years later and everything they sacrificed looked like it was about to pay off, Dragon Age was coming back. The silhouette behind the curtain looked and sounded like Dragon Age. I hoped and prayed this was Bioware reborn and renewed but when the curtain drew back we saw the deformed and grotesque amalgamation they created. The worst part was it wasn't alive, it had died long ago. 

Cobbled together from the scraps of its troubled development and the body parts of other games, Veilguard doesn't know what it's meant to be. The shocking announcement trailer portrayed a game that looked more like a hero shooter akin to Overwatch than a Dragon Age game, and it only got worse. Gradually details emerged of a simplified combat system, no companion control, more linear and curated maps and other departures from previous games that waved gargantuan red flags. I was terrified that Bioware had created a Dragon Age game, but in name only. I figured that, even with those changes, if the story was still good I could still extract something from Veilguard and it would be worth playing. I was deeply wrong, blinded by my love for what Bioware used to be and a franchise that has stuck with me since 2009. It's not just an unenjoyable experience but also an insulting one, which is not what you expect from a developer and a franchise of this calibre.

To keep my ranting to a manageable level I will break down my post-mortem of Dragon Age: The Veilguard to four sections; Story, Gameplay, Visuals and Performance. 

Story

Welcome back to Thedas, but not as you know it. Veilguard draws from the events of previous titles to a certain extent and, in some cases, delivers the occasional satisfying resolution to a few of Inquisition's key plot threads. A couple of the companion quests do also channel echoes of what Bioware used to be.The glaring issue is, however, that those moments are few and far between. Strange creative choices and the fanfiction-level writing overshadows the good stuff and makes you wonder why ninety percent of the game wasn't made the same way. It's a shame because the stakes are dialed up to eleven and it's supposed to be a balls to the wall, end of the world affair but rarely does Veilguard actually make you feel that way. Everything is soft, polished and tailored to be as unchallenging and safe as possible. Veilguard is a toothless, declawed beast, tamed for our convenience. 

Veilguard is and isn't a direct sequel to 2014's Dragon Age: Inquisition's Trespasser DLC. In the climactic finale of Trespasser Solas, a supposed Elven apostate who aids our Inquisitor protagonist, is revealed to be the fabled trickster god of the Elves who betrayed his kin and created the Veil that seperates the physical realm from that of spirits. His rebellion against the other, tyrannical Elven gods inadvertently caused the downfall of his people by severing their connection to immortality and powerful magic. Fueled by regret his renewed purpose is to tear down the veil which will allow spirits back into the physical world and restore his people to their former glory. In Veilguard he is close to completing the job he started ten years prior in Inquisition but our protagonist, Rook, is hot on his heels with companions old and new to stop him. As Varric Tethras' second in command Rook helps him confront Solas in the eleventh hour and stop the ritual. This traps Solas in the very prison he created for two of his rival gods while simultaneously releasing them into the world. Rook seeks to undo the damage with Solas' cryptic and duplicitous assistance and by raising an army to defeat the villainous duo of Elgar'nan and Ghilan'nain.

Veilguard's entire story is poisoned the baffling creative catasrophe made by Corinne Busch and Bioware's creative team to disregard all but three of the criticial plot threads from the last three games. By disconnecting Veilguard from the rest of the series it alienates returning players who have spent 15 years in Thedas. The world we know has become unrecognisable and characters we know and love are two-dimensional, carboard cutouts of themselves. It's almost like a parody of Dragon Age, and a bad one at that. Elements of the lore are either handled poorly or just ignored altogehter for convenience. Bioware basically stripped away 'unpalatable' elements of past games such as controversial decisions and companion deaths or anything that, frankly, was inconvenient to Veilguard's MO. As a result I found myself completely alienated. Previous games may have had different approaches and looked drastically different but because my choices were carried over and because each game still captured the essence of what it means to 'be' in Thedas I never had this problem, until now.

Part of the problem appears to have been Bioware's lack of drive and ambition. Patrick Weekes said in an interview that they didn't include an option for the protagonist to use highly controversial Blood Magic (Which was an option in Dragon Age 1 & 2) as it 'complicated' the story. Dude that's what Dragon Age fans are here for! We're here for 'complicated' plots and the opportunity to make questionable decisions. We live in the moral grey, it's the bread and butter of good RPG's. Veilguard's world, as a result, is soft, safe and as unchallenging as possible. Even when you get a tough choice it gives you clear indicators of what's going to happen in big flashing dialogue boxes that may as well say 'This decision will kill your companion'. The game is designed to be heavily curated and tailored to do exactly what the player wants. Some people will love that kind of self-indulgent gameplay but for me it removes all agency and decision-making. It all becomes meaningless because you just have to complete all the missions and make one dialogue decision to get the desired outcome you want. There's no morality system and regardless of what the game says companion approval means absolutely nothing. Everyone just agrees with what Rook does because that's what the story needs them to do. I made a series of choices that negatively impacted one character in particular but by the end of the game they were still my bestie. There is no challenge in Veilguard, no moment that made me pause the game to think about my choices or regret a costly decision like every other Dragon Age game. I was simply a passenger in a story featuring the most anaemic protagonist and group of companions in Dragon Age history.

The character creator may look extensive but don't be fooled, Veilguard is the weakest in the series for character-building and roleplaying. In Origins you can choose a backstory which serves as your prologue, you then get numerous dialogue opportunities to flesh out your character's past and personality. You even revisit areas or characters from your prologue and how your actions affected them. Veilguard offers a 'background' story to your Rook in which you can choose to work for a particular faction but rather than play a prologue or even a cut-scene with your chosen faction you are transported straight into the middle of the search for Solas. There are a few lines about how Rook disobeyed orders to perform some heroic deed and Varric subsequently recruits them. That's the crux of every backstory, by the way, regardless of which one you pick. I decided to roleplay as a no-nonsense Dwarven Grey Warden who goes in fists first and asks questions later. Dragon Age II was made seriously fun by being a sarcastic or aggressive Hawke, bludgeoning or insulting anyone who stands in your way. Sadly I found this impossible in Veilguard. Rook's personality ranges from junior football coach to HR rep and you are the 'inspirational glue' that holds the team together by resolving their disputes like you would small children and making endless small talk. Simply interacting with your companions and completing their quests, regardless of the outcome, makes them think you are The Maker's gift to Thedas. Veilguard thus commits a cardinal sin of RPG's, it prevents you from role-playing. You are forced to play a two-dimensional, morally perfect hero. Some people love that, I definitely prefer playing as 'good' characters in games but usually RPG's provide a bit more depth, choice and challenge that make you consider your reactions more carefully. Veilguard falls very short in that department so subsequently playing as Rook was a hollow and underwhelming experience.

It's a Bioware game, though! It's all about the companions, of course. Bioware games always feature a motley crew of interesting and complex comrades that can make up for a disappointing protagonist. Sadly the 'good' companion interactions are drowned out by the sheer volume of inane side quests and the fact ninety percent of their dialogue is exposition or repeated information. This is a rare problem to have in a Bioware game. A character that exemplifies this problem is Taash. Their quests seem the most superfluous and are mind-numbingly tedious, culminating in a disatisfying and surprisingly binary choice. You recruit them have two conversations with them and the next minute you are having a family dinner and are forced to choose what culture they should adopt - Qunari or Rivaini. I'm not kidding, that's the kind of binary choice Veilguard's story demands you to care about.

These poorly written and torturously structured companion distractions result in awful pacing issues. Frequently in the game's narrative a crucial event or a new threat is revealed but to get there you have to ping pong from one map to the next trying to complete companion quests. I ended up resenting several of the companions because I just wanted their very simple stories to be finished. Lucanis' personal quest lowered my IQ with how predictable it was. You can see the obvious betrayal coming in Act 1 but you are forced to drag through almost the entire game before you can pull your best 'surprised Pikachu face' at the reveal. Hilariously Rook is slow on the uptake as well and either acts surprised or sheepishly tries to cover up for their stupidity by saying something like 'yeah I never trusted that guy'. Oh gee thanks Rook, you couldn't have mentioned that before? To be blunt the companions and their quests are ultimately just padding, which I'll elaborate on in the Gameplay section. The insufferable character of Taash is a companion I would have ditched in a heartbeat if this was an old Bioware game, but Veilguard doesn't like conflict so we have to be friends with them. I found keeping them around an actual liability as they have the emotional intelligence of a child and seemed like someone who wasn't capable of performing their given role. The whole topic of their gender was actually the last thing that I was concerned about, I was worried that they were literally a child and I was endangering them. Their focus on gender identity and using the right pronouns made no sense when throughout the entire game they were literally refusing to refer to Emmerich by his own name. It's either wilful hypocrisy or bad writing, perhaps a bit of both in this case?

Veilguard's narrative tone is also a complete mess. One minute we're knee-deep in Blighted mucus and blood the next our companions are out-quipping Tony Stark or skipping around picking up flowers or truffles in enchanted forests. There's no sense of agency or urgency, any big dramatic peice or tragic moment is immediately drowned out and muffled by a hundred conversations about dresses and coffee. This is accentuated in the honest-to-god group therapy sessions at the end of key quests. The whole gang gets together and mostly just vents while repeating the same plot points we've heard over and over again, resulting in some pretty cringe 'go team' dialogue that totally sucks you out of the story. Moments of casual conversation or catharsis are fine. Other Bioware games made juggling serious subject matter and themes with small injections of humour and silliness into an art form. Veilguard does the opposite, very poorly. 

If I was to extract some highlights to keep things 'balanced' I would say the conversations with Solas and exploring his memories are enjoyable enough. I love the character so revelations about him and the Evanuris in general are nice reprieves from the over-saturating companion quests. Lore revelations about the Titans and Mythal are also quite big moments for Dragon Age fans, I definitely got a kick out of quests that involved the Titans or the Blight specifically. Emmerich is a genuinely interesting companion with a unique companion quest that explores the theme of death and offers genuinely profound moments of levity in a game so smothered in candyfloss. The finale is also very well executed, it does tie up a lot of loose ends and reflects a good number of your choices in the final battle. The final scenes with the Inquisitior, Morrigan and Solas are all executed fairly well but again not as good as what it was billed to be.

It's a crying shame because Veilguard's stort isn't dreadful per se. What few plot threads remain from previous games are actually pretty good but there just isn't enough of it. They're just completely obscured by dreadful dialogue, characters, soft and safe themes and the lack of connection to previous games. It's a gobstopper with a sour, nasty outer layer but with a tiny bitter-sweet centre that doesn't make up for the trouble it took to get there.

Gameplay 

This is where Veilguard really hits rock bottom and where my capacity for 'balance' in my reviews is capped. Veilguard's overall gameplay loop is an insulting and frustrating experience that has extinguished any desire I might have had to attempt another playthrough. The combat is fundamentally broken, the exploration and map designs are basic and the puzzles make Hogwarts legacy's ones look like Tri-dimensional chess. Progression, equipment, specialisations have also been watered down from previous games to go hand-in-hand with Veilguard's more hack n' slash combat. I said in the beginning Veilguard was cobbled together by parts of other games and I was referring directly to the gameplay, which seems to borrow from every other AAA game trope of the last ten years. Bioware aimed for more dynamic and 'fun' gameplay this time around but the result is a dated, repetitive and mind-numbing experience. 

One big slice of God of War, a smothering of Hogwarts Legacy, two pinches of Greedfall and a dollop of Kingdoms of Amalur; Veilguard combines elements of all these games to create something not nearly as good as any of them. The combat is incredibly basic and I saw lots of people claim 'I'm here for the story and not the combat', Veilguard is here for neither. Inquisition scaled down things like the number of abilities and was more 'action' based than previous titles but Veilguard strips it down completely. Combat is now a button-mashing affair complete with a primary, secondary and ultimate attack that reminds me more of Overwatch than Dragon Age. You have a dodge button and only get three, yes three, abilities as opposed to eight in Inquisition and dozens in previous games. As a result you bob and weave around the map tickling enemies with attacks, spam the same three abilities at enemies then rinse and repeat. The aforementioned titles throw in lots of unique enemy types, build and weapon variety or environment mechanics to spice up the gameplay loop and while Veilguard tries to there's just not enough to keep even the most casual gamer engaged.

Veilguard plays the same way at level 1 as it does at level 50 and once you get about 10 hours in you've seen everything the combat system has to offer. Gone is the party system where you could personally command your companions, Bioware wanted us to focus on just Rook because apparently that's more immersive. I'll tell you what isn't immersive, literally every enemy in a map bee-lining towards one dude and getting picked off one by one yet never changing their strategy. Every fight is a conveyor belt delivering one of maybe five or six enemy archetypes right to your Rook to get button-mashed into oblivion. 

Not only can you not control your companions but you should just forget caring about them altogether. They are now immortal bystanders who can pitch in one of three abilities and perform basic combos. Basically just think of them as the missing abilities you personally don't have, just with a lengthier cooldown. I get that they were trying to emulate Mass Effect with this system but it works in those games because you have vital and living squadmates that you have to command. If you screw up they die. Veilguard's companions may as well not exist, they bring almost nothing to the table and it honestly doesn't matter who you take on what mission as fights play out the same way every time. The combo animation is also the same regardless of who you combo with, the colour changes and that's about it. Also, because 60% of your game is comprised of companion quests the game practically decides who you take with you anyway. 

Specialisations have little bearing on how your character plays except for one unique ability and ultimate which you might not use anyway. You can chop and change builds on the fly, which is actually a neat feature as I was able to try out all of the warrior abilities and optimise my build. It also demonstrated how little progression and variety there is. The vast majority of perks are just things like a slight damage or defence bonus and it doesn't matter how many abilities you can unlock because you are hamstrung by the three ability limit.

It's actually such a shame because the first few hours of the game feel quite new and dynamic, it almost seems like the combat could get good but it doesn't evolve past that point. If you like in-depth combat this will literally entertain you for three hours then become a chore. I played the game on Nightmare and all that did was drag my playthrough on an extra twenty to thirty hours because all it does is make enemies super spongey. Even bosses are just upgraded versions of standard enemies who have incredibly basic movesets that you can work out fairly easily. I was killing bosses ten levels above me, it just took me a little longer. The gameplay is essentially the same quality as a mobile game or an old beat em' up arcade, it's genuinely that superficial and basic. Many in the Dragon Age community crap on Origins for being a archaic and clunky but by comparison its combat system is light-years ahead of Veilguard. Don't let a bit of polish fool you, Veilguard plays like an average game from twenty years ago.

Bioware boasted that Veilguard's exploration elements are less bloated and more intuitive than its predecessor, Inquisition. They even highlighted the infamous 'Hinterlands problem' that saw many players become overwhelmed with the size of the map and number of side quests that they seemingly needed to complete, not knowing they can leave and return at any given point. Personally I never saw this as an issue but clearly the boffins at Bioware agreed that their previous games were just too complicated. As a result Veilguard's maps are a series of claustrophobic corridors that may as well have giant arrows and a helpdesk guiding you to your next objective. There are some puzzles but they are genuinely insulting to any sentient creature, they're just there to stall you and make the world seem larger than it actually is. There are also hidden corridors and nooks that are gatekeeped by special companion abilities that, when you recruit that companion, will become available to you. Rook is also able to signal or summon any companion to access parts of the map without having them in your party. Harding will be chilling in the player hub, The Lighthouse, while you are in Arlathan Forest using her stone sense abilities to clear an obstacle. Not only is this horribly immersion-breaking but it also means exploration in Veilguard has zero replayability. Inquisition did this system correctly by making areas of the map accessible to specific classes. So as long as you had a balanced party you could traverse every part of the map in a realistic way. 

Veilguard's world and characters are so utterly devoid of personality and life that extends to it's environments. The locations look pretty but there's nothing to do outside of companion and dull fetch quests. Skyhold, Kirkwall and even Denerim's bloody marketplace are all more dynamic and full of life than Veilguard's major cities and locations. I don't think I encountered a single NPC who had conversation dialogue outside of companion quests. You get the odd NPC reciting lines but that's it. You don't get a sense that people actually live or work anywhere in Veilguard. The 'world-building' is found in little bits of environmental set peices that you have to really scour the map to find and they are ultimately worthless because you don't interact with them in any meaningful way.

Veilguard also demands you to loot, a lot. Upgrade materials, gold and valuables are behind every corner hidden in (You guessed it) pots and boxes. Seriously, like a God of War or Zelda game you are charging around every nook of the map smashing fucking pots to get gold. I was this close to redesigning my Rook to look like Mario because it felt like I was playing a platform title. I saw more of Crash Bandicoot in Veilguard than other Dragon Age games.


Veilguard also has a player hub, hidden in the Fade, called The Lighthouse. Solas' old hideout is pretty and contains some neat lore-related secrets to uncover but I couldn't help but rue this massive downgrade. Inquisition's Skyhold is one of the best 'hubs' in modern gaming. It is a marvel to behold with secrets, easter eggs, interesting characters, upgradable and customisable areas which becomes a home from home. To go from that to a hub that barely matches the one you get in Origins, which is filled with genuinely interesting characters and interactions, is incredibly deflating.

Finally, another aspect of the gameplay that really irked me was the apparent lack of a faction system. In Veilguard every faction helps you regardless of choices you make, there's no loyalty system to speak of. Instead you get a reputation bar which goes up on completion of companion quests and, absurdly, when you sell or buy things from their merchants. Frankly, this is a disgrace coming from Bioware whose previous games all had some kind of relationship system with different factions that depended on the player's actions. In Mass Effect 3 you are given two monumental choices that greatly impact which of the races follow your banner and which decide to go it alone. These choices have drastic consequences. In Veilguard you again have the Treviso or Minrathous 'choice' and even though I saved Treviso I still had full Shadow Dragon support by about two thirds of my way into the game because I sold a bunch of junk to them. It's a horrible system that rewards time spent in the game rather than your actual choices. 


Veilguard represents everything that's wrong with modern AAA gaming. In a bid to be as 'accessible' as possible they diluted an amazing formula. My big confession is that I never took to Dragon Age Origins first time around, I was so used to Mass Effect and found the more challenging and janky combat frustrating at first but it was a grower. I realised I made a series of mistakes and poor choices (Like going to Orzammar straight after Redcliffe) so started again. Veilguard is risk-averse, sanitised and doesn't challenge you outside of making enemies chunkier. This isn't a statement about making games technically harder but adding in curve balls now and then, daring to challenge the player to think about their actions and not have their hand held every step of the way. Just because I got stuck in Origins didn't mean the game wasn't player-friendly, it just meant my actions had consequences and that's what RPG's are supposed to be about.


Visuals

Veilguard is technically pretty, no doubt about that. Arlathan Forest, the Necropolis and Weisshaupt all have moments where I stopped and went wow, that looks cool. Treviso and Minrathous are nice but very generic locations, the latter genuinely reminded me of Dragon Age 2's Kirkwall in terms of it's architecture and colour pallet. The main problem I had is that all the 'cool' places, the sprawling vistas, the gorgeous colours and incredible backgrounds were all out of reach. Despite that I did enjoy diving into photo mode and trying to capture some of the better environments, genuinely this was a highlight of the game for me. Just like in the Mass Effect Legendary Edition the photo mode has lots of cool options and I had a lot of fun with it. The game is very vibrant and colourful but too soft and saturated for a Dragon Age game. The only areas that look remotely dark fantasy and threatening are where the blight has consumed everything. Even then those areas are filled with very stylised, overly bright 'blight boils' that are basically big pulsating objective signs which look incredibly silly. Nothing in Veilguard comes close to capturing a sense of dread and awe like The Temple of Sacred Ashes, an under-seige Denerim or The Deep Roads from Origins let alone the vast majority of locations from Inquisition. They don't look bad, just too waxy and colourful for a supposed dark fantasy RPG.


Character designs are such a weird mixed-bag, I really didn't know what to make of Veilguard's art style. Some of the enemy and character designs looked pretty cool. I particularly liked the Gloom Howler from Davrin's questline and Anaris. They looked like they could belong in previous Dragon Age games. Many, on the other hand, appeared to be lifted straight from a Blizzard game or a Pixar movie. I worked really hard to make a 'realistic' looking Rook but most of the NPC designs were way too cartoony which made him look really out of place. The redesigned demons and darkspawn look utterly atrocious, just generic enemies that would fit better into the MCU than Dragon Age. Defenders of Veilguard would argue character designs have changed in each of the previous games, which is true but they were never neutered to the extent they are in Veilguard. 

The hair physics and designs in Veilguard are clearly where all the budget, creativity and development went because my god is there a lot of hair. I didn't even utilise 90% of them but I enjoyed playing around with the faces in the character creator. You can make some genuinely good faces, some of the best I've seen in an RPG. Bauldur's Gate 3 and Dragon's Dogma 2 seem to be the only games I know of that top these facial designs. Body customisation is a low point however, there are very few sliders that change much for males and females. The character models also have weirdly sloped shoulders and a weak posture that result in really unnatural stances. Making every character's frame look the same but adjusting the height depending on the race is a terrible waste of an otherwise good character creator. 

Veilguard's visuals are technically on a high level but smothered with a layer of vaseline so thick it conceals every possible hint of dirt and grime. Every character is a fashionista with perfect skin and hair, every race just looks the same with pointier ears or an adjusted height. Everything is just so homogeneous and inoffensive. Inquisition had some very reflective lighting and waxy textures but the art style still managed to create sublime, dangerous and striking visuals which are synonymous with Dragon Age. Yeah there were some rough character models and the charcter creator could be a nightmare sometimes but they had their own distinct look. The over-stylised, clean and glossy approach of Veilguard just doesn't do it for me. 


Performance 

This is by far and way Veilguard's best attribute. The game runs smooth as butter on Series X and S on both of its' graphic settings. You have the option to prioritise fidelity or performance which target 30 fps and 60fps respectively. On Xbox I found both settings managed to look comfortably smooth with no drastic drops. I preferred to run on performance mode as the drop in graphic quality was pretty negligible. I only ever came across one glitched quest in my entire playthrough which simply required me to exit the map and return, the problem seemed to fix itself. 

The game has been in development for roughly 6 years, they had plenty of time to iron out bugs and issues. Bioware also took great pride in promoting the game as a finished product, no DLC's or day one patches in sight. It's refreshing to see that in an era where AA companies are getting away with releasing unfinished games at full cost. Thankfully Bioware have avoided another Andromeda debacle, no game-breaking bugs or dodgey animations to be seen here. I guess that's some positive progress and a good sign that Bioware have finally got a stable game engine for Mass Effect 5. 

Conclusion 

I'm currently in stage 5 in the grieving process, acceptance. I have finally come to realise that Bioware is not a creative and revolutionary powerhouse in gaming. Something has happened. I wonder if it is the failure of Andromeda and Anthem that prompted Bioware to play it so safe. Could it have been the troubled development process? They had to resurrect the remains of a live service multiplayer game into a single player game. A difficult process. Part of me wonders whether EA knew this game would flop and didn't want another live service failure so forced Bioware to make Veilguard instead? A big part of Veilguard's failure, I believe, is hubris. The whole game smacks of patronising arrogance, that the writers felt the old Dragon Age stories were too problematic and complicated so they made a new, 'better' one. To retcon and wipe out or force shut 15 years of lore written by your predecessors is not a decision made with good intentions. Veilguard strips away player agency and choice in favour of a 'curated' story that you are merely a bystander in,  because they don't want you to deviate from the story they want to tell. Everything is so sanitised and HR approved because they live in this soft and safe corporate world that doesn't understand the motivations and challenges real people face. Corrine Busch is happy to engage in the political game and label people who didn't like or didn't buy Veilguard as 'chuds' and 'grifters'. While there is a sad, anti-woke element to hate directed at Veilguard Bioware are playing the victim and hiding behind that to protect themselves from criticism. You know something is desperately wrong with your game when that's your marketing strategy.

While the game runs well and functions as a mediocre action game it is not an RPG and it's the Coke Zero of the Dragon Age series. I forced myself to finish Veilguard in spite of the dreadful writing, illusion of choice, mind-numbing gameplay loop, boring characters, awful pacing, level design and numerous other gripes only feel hollow and unrewarded. Unsurprisingly I do not recommend this game, maybe if you want an RPG-lite action game to pass the time get it on sale? Considering that the game is already retailing at 40% off it won't be long before you can get this game at a price it's actually worth.",0,1761211743.0,dragonage,14,0.45,False

It just helped me feel like normal, just not as sleepy. I didn’t know why. I would get a venti 5 shot Americano. People balked at my order and couldn’t understand why I wasn’t bouncing off the walls. I didn’t realize it was that strong because it didn’t feel like it to me. I told them that it had almost no effect on me whatsoever. 

For a long time I followed the rule no caffeine after twelve noon but recently I developed a hankering for Coke Zero. I was cautious at first but then said hell with it and started drinking it at any time I felt like it and I can still go to sleep afterwards. Recently after 4 days of no sleep (insomnia), I was going to church and grabbed a Coke Zero hoping it would keep me awake and it most certainly did not.

You know the kind of town where everyone knows everyone? Where the local diner serves coffee in mugs stamped with your name, and everyone will lend a hand to a neighbor in need? A place where generations of families grew up together?

Well, that is the sort of place where I live. Sure, it is a bit rustic, hell I barely have reliable internet. But it is nice enough for us. It’s the kind of place where time feels like it’s standing still, except for one thing—the nights. The nights here are a little different.

I’ve lived here all my life, and there’s no place I’d rather be. Or at least, that’s what I used to think. This place has its quirks, like any small town, but there’s a big one that stands out for us.

You see, every night, without fail, at 11:38 PM, the town… locks down.

I’m not talking about just closing up shops and less people being out and about. I’m talking about a real lockdown. Door's slam shut and are barred, windows rattle and lock and everyone knows they have to be inside and stay inside, at least for what happens next.

The next part is strange, no one ever sees anything moving out there directly, but we all just know. We just know that somehow, something outside is trying to get in.

An eerie silence falls over the streets. It’s like the whole town is holding its breath. Then in twelve minutes exactly, it is just over.

I’ve always wondered why it happens at exactly 11:38pm. People here don’t talk about it much, but when they do, they whisper. They say it’s just the way things are, that it’s been happening for as long as anyone can remember. But I know better. I’ve seen it. Whatever it is.

The first time I noticed it; I was still pretty young. I think I was ten or eleven. I’d stayed up late reading some of my favorite comic books. My parents warned me like many other kids in town that we had to go to bed early, but if we did get up, then absolutely no leaving the house or leaving any windows or doors open.

I was not asleep, but was still following the rules, when I heard the strangest sound. It was a low, guttural hum that seemed to vibrate through the walls. I looked out the window, and that’s when I saw it. The streets were empty, but there was… a presence. It’s hard to describe. It wasn’t a person or an animal. It was something else. Something that didn’t feel like it belonged. It moved with this strange, jerky motion, like it wasn’t entirely in control of its own body. It radiated a disturbing sense of distortion that made my head hurt and my eyes had a difficult time focusing on it. I could feel this overwhelming sense of hunger that made my skin crawl. Before I knew it, it was over. It had passed my house and I realized I had been staring out my window in a hypnotic daze. It was almost midnight and I went to sleep and did not tell my parents about the disturbing thing I had seen.

I didn’t see it again for years, but the feeling never left. Every night at 11:38 on the dot, when the town shuts down, I know it is there. We all try to act like it’s not. Just behave like we have a strict curfew and that nothing is really out there. Yet the people who are too bold or foolish and think that it’s nothing, well they don’t last long.

Those of us who are still here know that whatever that thing is, it’s out there. Stalking, hunting. Looking for anything, an open window, a cracked door.

Disappearances are frequent, especially for such a small town. The police have a whole song and dance for anyone who goes missing from the outside, but when it is a resident, well it is more of a case where the families of the victims are reprimanded for not having known better.

No one knows why the window of time is so mercifully brief. Almost just as suddenly as it starts, it’s over. By 11:50 PM, the streets are quiet again, and the town feels normal. But it’s not normal. It never was.

People here have learned to live with it. They lock their doors, shut their windows, and pretend it’s not happening. I asked my parents why we don’t just move and they never gave me a good answer. All they said was, “It wouldn’t do any good. We have to endure. It has to be here. It is safer for everyone if it’s here.” It did not make sense, I know people can get attached to places but it felt crazy to me. I couldn’t just pretend this was normal, not after what I saw. Not after what I felt. There was something out there, and it was worse than anyone would believe.

It was just recently that I saw it again. It was a normal night, at least as normal as nights could be in my town. I was getting ready to go to bed, when I noticed that my cat Quincy was missing. I looked everywhere but I couldn't find him. Then I heard something and looked through the window to spot a familiar shape and my heart sank. He was outside!

He must have gotten out when I had come home earlier and was sauntering along the sidewalk, clueless to the impending danger. The time was 11:36pm. I had no idea if the creature did anything to animals, but I did not want to find out. I had never let Quincy outside before and he did not come back to my shouted calls for his return. I had to do something, something dangerous and stupid to save him. I rushed outside, sprinting toward him and trying to grab him and bring him in before it was too late.

I managed to reach him and pick him up. But then I froze when I sensed a presence as I was scrambling back to my door. Quincy’s ears folded back and he hissed. I felt paralyzed and then I thought I saw it again. It was different this time. Larger, and more overwhelming than before. Its presence seemed to fill the entire street, pressing against the houses like an unseen force. I tried to run, but my legs wouldn’t move. I was frozen in place, my breath caught in my throat.

To my horror it seemed to finally regard me. Quincy jumped out of my hands and ran back to my house. He had fortunately evaded whatever interest the thing might have had with him.

The creature's head twisted unnaturally in my direction, its distorted features coalescing into more recognizable shapes. Staring into the grotesque visage forced a scream out of me as I beheld the blasphemous impossibility. I turned and sprinted away, screaming like a maniac. My heart hammering against my ribcage with such force that each beat felt like it might crack my chest open. The sound of its pursuit echoed behind me, a wet slapping noise like a monstrous jellyfish gliding across the ground. Its deafening roar filled the air, shaking the ground beneath my feet as I ran for my life. I did not know if I could get away, no one I knew had been outside and survived.

I ducked into an alley, my hands shaking as I pressed myself against the wall. My breath came in short, sharp gasps, and I could feel sweat dripping down my face. I didn’t dare look around the corner. I didn’t dare move.

And then I heard the harrowing screams. They sliced through the air, piercing and full of terror. My heart raced as I strained to see who was making them, but all I could make out were shadowy figures caught in the open. The screams were short, sharp, and then they were swallowed by the night. The deafening silence that followed only added to the fear weighing down on me.

I stayed pressed against the wall, trying to make myself as small and invisible as possible. The darkness seemed to come alive with every creak and rustle, amplifying my fear. I held my breath until I heard the sound of the creature moving away. And then, just like that, it was gone.

But the eerie stillness lingered, haunting me even after the clock struck 11:50 PM.

The streets were once again quiet, but my nerves were still on edge. I stumbled back to my house, every step feeling like a race against time. Quincy waited anxiously at the door and bolted inside with me, seeking shelter inside.

The horrible night had left me shaken, but grateful to be alive. Whatever that thing is, it does not belong in this world. It is not of this time or place, and its presence is so unsettling, it makes your mind ache just to catch a glimpse of it. No one can tell of its origins, maybe they are lost in the depths of history. But whatever its history, it remains. Always there, lurking in the shadows every night without fail.

At that point I did the one thing you probably think everyone should have done by now, I left my hometown. I moved to the largest city I could reach to get away from it all. My parents did not approve, in fact they tried to tell me I could not go. I was so desperate to get out of there, that I had to sneak away in the early morning, when they could not interfere.

I never understood why we all stayed there and tried to ignore the eldritch nightmare that hunted us at night. It seemed so simple and I felt better at first. The city felt alive with the hum of traffic and the distant chatter of people during the day, a cacophony that made me feel safe, anonymous.

Indeed, I thought I’d left the nightmare behind, that the creature was just a memory, a relic of a past I could bury.

My new apartment is a cozy studio on the fifth floor, with a view of the bustling streets below. High enough where looking out the window does not fill me with dread at night.

Unfortunately, something happened last night that has shattered the fragile illusion of my peaceful transition.

On the first night in my new place, I sat on the edge of my bed, flipping through a magazine to distract myself from the creeping unease that had settled in the pit of my stomach. The clock on the nightstand read 11:28 PM. I told myself I was being paranoid, that the creature was gone, that I was safe now. But the weight of the past lingered, a shadow in the corner of my mind that I couldn’t shake.

By 11:38 PM, the city outside my window was eerily quiet. The usual sounds of traffic and distant music had faded, replaced by an unsettling stillness. I tried to focus on the magazine, but my eyes kept drifting toward the window, the darkness beyond the glass pressing in on me. And then, I heard it—a soft, tentative tap against the pane.

My heart skipped a beat. I froze, the magazine slipping from my fingers and falling to the floor. The sound was light, almost imperceptible, but it sent a chill coursing through my veins. I told myself it was nothing, I was just being paranoid. But then it came again—another tap, this time more insistent.

I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe. My eyes were fixed on the window, the darkness beyond it seeming to pulse with a life of its own. The tapping stopped, and for a moment, there was nothing but silence. Then, a faint scratching sound, like claws on glass. My heart sank. I knew that sound, I knew what it meant.

Slowly, with my legs trembling beneath me, I rose from the bed and approached the window. My hand reached for the curtain, hesitated, and then, with a deep, shaky breath, I pulled it back. What I saw made me freeze in terror. The creature was perched on the fire escape outside my window, its twisted form silhouetted against the moonlit sky. Its eyes glowed with an unnatural light, and its presence seemed to fill the room, pressing in on me with an unspeakable horror.

I tried to scream, but the sound caught in my throat. The creature’s head tilted to the side, its gaze locked on mine, and I felt a wave of dread wash over me. It was here. It had followed me. And then, as if in slow motion, its mouth opened, revealing rows of jagged teeth, and it let out a low, guttural growl. The sound shattered the paralysis that held me in place. I stumbled back, my voice finally breaking free in a raw, terrified scream. The creature’s form seemed to blur and shift, its presence filling the room with an unspeakable darkness. And then, everything went black.

I regained consciousness and I know it is not over. There is no escape from this thing that has followed me. I consider what my parents had said when I asked them why we never moved. Then, with dawning horror I realize the truth of their words. “It is safer for everyone if it’s here. ”

They did not mean it was safer for us. They meant it was safer for everyone else. They knew the danger; they stayed to keep it there. Now in my ignorance, I have made a huge mistake. Somehow, it knew I left. It has followed me here, to a place where over a million people will soon know about its existence and maybe more if it moves beyond that. I am so sorry for bringing it here, I didn’t know.

Please for your own safety, stay inside between 11:38pm and 11:50pm. By now, it might not be safe wherever you are as well.",1,1761211700.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

This is going to be long, im so sorry... 

We connected really quickly in the beginning, getting together just after the first couple dates, and for the first couple months it was a dream. He would make time for me, get me gifts, post me without me asking, we loved eachother's friends, etc. I made a couple VERY bad mistakes, such as bumping into someone i used to have romantic feelings for and making conversation, and keeping people who i had found attractive still followed on social media etc. 

I'm a very physically touchy person, so im touchy with quite a lot of my friends, and so we had an issue or two about that but we smoothed it out super easy. But since then, for the past 7 months, its been constant issue after issue. It started with not being allowed to see any of my friends of the opposite gender, wasnt allowed to hang out in a group of people with him, he would be guilt trippy when i did want to hang out with people, and he would say it's just because he's introverted. My friends loved him, but then he started making me sit away from them instead of in groups. I wasnt allowed to post anything of myself, wasnt allowed to be extremely friendly with people because it worried him. 

I got pretty fed up and told him he was being really controlling to me, especially because at the time, nothing bad had really happened between us. No one's perfect, we both made some silly mistakes, but nothing to prove i was disloyal. I ended up breaking up with him, but we still stayed in contact.

During that time we were broken up, i told him i might want to try and move on, and he said he wouldnt. 2 weeks after we had broken up, i got back in contact with someone i had liked about a year ago, and we went out on a date. We both agreed not to pursue much, we were freshly out of relationships and it was too fresh. We ended up going out again where we decided to break things off because we both didnt like eachother too much and i wanted to try again with my boyfriend. Me and this guy did absolutely nothing romantic. We went out for coffee, he put his arm around me awkwardly on the ferry ride home, thats the extent of it. 

I talked to my boyfriend about getting back together, we went on another first date again, all the cute stuff. I ended up not telling him about this date with this guy, but even before all that, my boyfriend told me he wantes to cut off my 2 male friends, who were both dating eachother, and still was weird about most of the stuff i broke up with him for. I told him about the ""date"" with this guy, and he flipped out completely. Which i understood, and he was allowed to be mad, but we werent together, just in contact. 

Since then, which was in August, its been argument after argument. Im not allowed to hang out with anyone he doesnt approve of, ive lost countless friends, had to cut off most people, cannot talk to any men whatsoever unless spoken to, no posting myself or anything at all, he constantly goes through my following and if theres someone missing or someone added i have to tell him, i have to text him every 30 mins at least to tell him what im doing, location on, everything. No tank tops, no shorts, nothing that could be considered revealing, because then im showing off. No excessive makeup. I'm not allowed to go anywhere without him. No male friends, but he's allowed to have female ones. He's uncomfortable with me being an actor and being in the creative industry (which is my passion)! I feel like im being surveyed, I hate it.

I know hes hurt, and maybe it's my fault he's not the guy I got with. He's amazing, he treats me well, makes time for me, shows me he loves me, and i feel it. But i feel like ive had to shrink myself for him, I dont feel like me anymore, and i cant stand feeling like im his pet or something. Am i overreacting? is this all my doing? whenever i try and talk about this he throws it back in my face telling me hes doing all this because of me, which is true i guess.

Granted, maybe it won't do me any good, guides say no prolonged sitting, no coffee, and yes I'm probably punishing myself but this is the result of too much suffering and not getting enough sleep!  I'm rebelling!  I **want** my life back!

One thing I realized when it comes to these kind of things is that when you live by guides and rules and stop doing things that you enjoy life becomes a lot more stressful.  If you don't want to feel stressed, and get better, then stop taking these things as gospel!  Sure you should consider making some lifestyle changes, it might not hurt to go for a walk every now and then or at least do some pelvic physio to rehabilitate, but these changes shouldn't be so drastic that you are missing out on everything that kept you content before it even happened.  Besides, who's to say that these guides and rules apply to everyone?  Not everyone is the same, what works for one may not work for another.

So yeah, I'm done letting this rule my life, I'm taking my life back, one step at a time.  And maybe make a few life changes while I'm at it, but nothing too drastic.

*October 21, 2025*

I was drinking my coffee cup, and took the lid off to let it cool more quickly. When I took a sip, I saw these balls along the edge. I was desperate for coffee, so I just drank from the other side of the mug. Gross, I know, but I’m an addict; what do you want from me?Then I took another sip and saw some in the bottom as well. I slowly poured it out and saw all of these sitting in the bottom of the mug. What could they possibly be?

Some possibly necessary background information: I live in the United States, and I have no idea what goes into the coffee. My girlfriend makes it for me in the mornings. My best guess is coffee and lactose free milk. Occasionally, she will use creamer, but it didn’t taste that sweet today.  

And there is a 0.1% chance she is trying to kill me. I would estimate that closer to 0.0%. Despite how crazy I drive myself, for some reason, she really loves me, and I’m pretty sure she didn’t do this to kill me. I think.  

Please help, I am wavering back-and-forth between successfully, blocking it out of my mind and on the verge of throwing up every five seconds.  I picked up a McDonald’s, sugar-free iced coffee in hopes that all of the preservatives that are in it will successfully kill whatever I have involved in my desperation, but McDonald’s coffee only last for so long before it’s gone, hopefully unlike me.

I’m sorry for not replying sooner. The work day got away from me, and when I went to reply, I found the post had been locked. Here’s the update:

1. I am alive

2. My girlfriend didn’t try to kill me. Yet. Hopefully this continues.

3. They are not coffee eggs or moth eggs.

4. /u./everyatom2012
 nailed it solved! It was time release aderol that my girlfriend put on the lid of my coffee. In my early morning haze, I took the lid off to let the coffee cool. When I did that, the pill must have fallen through the “mouth” of the lid and dissolved everything but the time-release balls. I’m speculating here, because mornings are hard, yo.

5. I showed my girlfriend the post. She was horrified and said she was never bringing me coffee again. After much apologies and begging, she is in fact bringing me coffee again. But now in an anti-wolfmansbruhther container to protect me from myself.

6. Thank you all for yourself. I saw the suggestions of moth eggs and about lost my breakfast. On to brighter days.

just trying to vent my frustration after 1,5 years with the S1 pro.

The positive first. It's really a well built machine in terms of pure build quality. It's heavy and each cover is screwed on with about double the amount of screws than any other robo vac i had in my hands (And i'm using them for nearly 20 years already). So there's that.

But then to the downsides: When it arrived the software was really mediocre. Especially the navigation and path planning were kind of odd. It kept a way to big distance to furniture so it couldn't properly clean. Also the disappointment was that there was not a single piece of dirt detection in all the high res RGB AI Camera Voxel thing whatever.

But we all know things can be fixed in software, right? Well no, unfortunately not as it seems. 18 months later and it still keeps a huge distance to furniture and when 2x cleaning an area no matter the shape it only does it with cross paths. Due to the nature of the rolling mopp this leads to an additional 20% loss in cleaning area.

The rolling mopp... for me this was the main reason to get it, I liked the idea and I still think it's good as it's able to cover a wide area and the permanent cover with fresh water and cleaning at the same time is theoretically great. If only they had the full picture in mind. With the distance it keeps to the sides its basically useless because it drops the advantage of reaching far out to the case. With the lack of dirt detection and slowing down at dirty spots or maybe even coming back to clean again it just doesn't clean any dried stains. 

In their marketing they explicity talk about the good cleaning abilities for coffee and ketchup stains - both just don't work at all with ours.

I gotta say i'm really disappointed after only 18 months I'll likely be in the market for a replacement soon and it'll surely not be a Eufy again. Our Roborock S7 that mops a different floor and was released over a year before the S1 is doing a way better job with its ""traditional"" vibration mop - mainly because it's just moving smarter.

And by the way - where's that upgrade for freshwater and drain connection? I can see it unavailable on Amazon and Eufy itself seems to only sell the bundle with the robot. Is it even working? Is anyone using it? I haven't heard anything about it.",1,1761210954.0,eufy,0,1.0,False
1odyg7v,https://www.reddit.com/r/HiatalHernia/comments/1odyg7v/90_healed/,90% Healed,"I thought I should spread the good news that this thing is totally healable and you can live a normal life again. 

After 3 years of horrible HH which didn’t let me sleep well at night or have a normal daily life, finally 3 months ago I managed to be back to 90% of how I used to be before HH.

I weighed 75kg before HH, then due to HH I couldn’t eat normal sized meals or high energy foods so came down to 64 KG (used to look like matches stick) but now in just 3 months am 76.5 KG.



MOST important things I did to get here:

• No food at least within the last 2 hours before sleep (I used to eat 2 meals worth of food right before bed which got me in this mess)

• Sleep in a slope/angle of minimum 25 degrees and sleep on your left side (I cannot emphasise enough how important this is)

Remember good sleep heals your stomach and the muscles get back to original form. Bad sleep affects two things the most: Brain and Gut

• Chew your food VERY WELL (Make it easy for your stomach to quickly pass food to the next stage as unchewed food stacks up in the stomach for a long time making acid come up and your hernia getting worse due to too much food in your food pipe, stretching the poor thing). If you can make your food mushy you’ll thank yourself

• Drink green tea + 3 teaspoon honey during your meals as it helps smoothen the food and keeps pushing the food down into the next stage

• 10 minutes after your meals (in 2 of or 3 of your meals a day) take some METAMUCIL 4 in 1 Fibre (Psyllium Husk). 
THIS WAS A GAME CHANGER FOR ME.
This absorbs the stomach acid and excess bile, forms a smooth jelly like coating around your food which protects the stomach lining from acid (no more burning) and at the same time carries the food smoothly down to the next stage without putting pressure on stomach and food pipe. The trick is to take less than the recommended dose because recommended dose might make your symptoms worse as fibre is a hard thing to digest for your stomach.
My experience is that half a teaspoon in half a glass of water (mix quickly and take in quickly) 5-10 minutes after a meal works WONDERS.

I can literally eat anything now, junk food, big meals, dark chocolate, coffee, fatty stuff…….. all except citrus fruits and highly spicy stuff (but that’s because I always had acid reflux).

Any questions, let me know I am more than happy to answer.

In space, nobody can hear you scream: ***“Holy shit, what was that!?”*** when an orange streak shoots through the system and clips your favorite asteroid. What's worse is that not only did it not stop to exchange insurance info, but it was blasting music so loud it caused the cosmic dust to convey sound! Who writes a song about turning innocent church girls into *‘certified nymphoz’* anyway?! Honestly, this galactic neighborhood has gone to shit…

Fortunately, the ARK-2eb, AKA the ‘Ark-2 Electric Boogaloo’, had enough durasteel plating to render small light-speed space rocks inconsequential. What it did not have, however, was a ‘cold’ fusion reactor, and all that wasted heat had to go somewhere. Most of it was directed to the copious radiators that lined the ship's hull, thus the ‘orange streak’. But some was allocated to other areas, such as interior heating, the stove, and in the case of what Noah was doing… His homemade durasteel forge.

And like every ratchet-ass redneck Dura-Forge setup, it was basically a radiation shielded room with an anvil, a hatch into the reaction chamber, and a gold/lead-plated robot-human facsimile wired to a VR rig. Oh, and speakers… ‘cause who in their right mind does back-yard engineering without a slightly too loud sound system blasting their ‘totally original’ playlist and/or the local radio? A heathen, that's who.

Durasteel, as ironically ‘metal’ as it sounds, is a mostly ferrous alloy that has such a high melting point it can only be forged in atomic fire. Normally, durasteel is produced with high-intensity heating elements powered by cold-fusion reactors, which is the ‘safe’ and ‘sane’ way to do it. Buuuut… Then there was the human way to do it.

Somebody who didn't own an industrial-scale reactor once asked. ‘Why don't we just heat the material with the reaction itself?’ to which some cool guy said. ‘Fuck it, why not?’ and filmed the process on his comm-link. The DIY community clout was enormous, especially after he turned the radioactive slag into a self-heating coffee mug and his teeth fell out.

Many pre-integrated species were warned against creating durasteel this way, as it’s both dangerous and irradiates the durasteel itself. Thus, the practice was banned in the Galactic Community, ‘cause nobody wants radioactive ship armor, no matter how ‘rad’ it sounds. There was a way around this problem; you just needed to give the material a quick nitric-acid bath to peel away the outermost layer of radioactive material, while any deeper radiation remained locked away inside the material itself. Lead paint helps too…

Despite this, the law was never repealed, as most species moved on to cold fusion long before they figured out ways to make it safer.

Cue Noah, not making it any safer. Stripped of everything but shorts, sandals, and a VR sensor suite, he glistened with sweat and channeled the flow of his species' classical composers. So elegant, so refined, so prone to making people attempt the traditional dances of two rival multi-century-old gangs. Gangs that had long since stopped fighting in the name of giving younger gangbangers their time in the sun(s)... ***For now.*** God bless the ‘Violet Treaty’.

The interior of the ship was sweltering from running the reactor hot, rushing back to Salafor, and with a three-day trip still ahead of them, he might as well put the excess heat to good use. If those pirates were armed with N-BARs and modernized munitions, he’d need something sturdier than his usual graphene and nano-tube-mesh clothing. 

That aside, who said you couldn’t make solving your problems fun? Groovin’, hammerin’, and occasionally shoveling ice onto the reactor to cool it down. It gave Noah plenty of time to enter the mythical flow state. “Hmm, need smaller pieces… to pinch the metal or cop out and look for where the laser cutter went… pinch metal… look for laser cutter…” he glanced around at the cluttered reactor room. “Options…”

*Meanwhile…*

Nyathens, one of the oldest sun-kin settlements still standing, and one of the few that didn’t start as a monastery. Like most sun-kin settlements, it was built atop a large mesa that made it a natural fortress during the clay age, but the march of progress eventually forced it to expand beyond the safety the limited space provided. Countless bridges now stitched the canyon-lands around the mesa, as if waiting to be pulled taut and close the tectonic wound.

Office buildings, apartment complexes, and aging infrastructure clung to the canyon walls like the wound’s infection, but any building of import remained on the mesa despite the land premium. Even after declaring Nyathens the capital during ‘The Great Compromise’, the skyline hardly changed… minus the direly needed spaceport.

“So, Nyathens… Kinda short, ain't it?” Kaykay asked, looking around at all the various classical structures that had been crammed onto the mesa, including the hotel they'd be staying at.

He and Tobby were waiting with the cars outside the Ruby Pass hotel. It may have a 4.1 star rating, but it was 4.1 stars of ***too expensive*** as far as Tobby was concerned. Yes, it had a pool, a continental breakfast, a fancy restaurant where they cook the food in front of you, and an on-site spa… but a 1-night stay still cost more than the flight they took to Nyathens to begin with! Sure, it was on the Wiskitos tab, but that just made Tobby feel worse! Few things stabbed Tobby in the guilt more than someone else spending money on him.

“Haven’t you been here before?” Tobby asked, trying to contribute to the small talk as they waited for everyone to get ready. Night had fallen, and the event was starting within the hour. Timetable anxiety swelled to the point he could burst into worried pacing any moment now. He’d already looked at his assistant five times!

Kaykay shrugged, leaning on the driver's side door as he took in the compact cityscape. “Well, yeah… but it always feels weird thinkin’ about all this is supposed to be. Ya know? Like.. All this,” he gestured vaguely at the whole city, “is the literal seat of an interplanetary government, the paper-pusher heartland, and it feels smaller than Nykata.”

There were several reasons for that ‘feeling’ as Kaykay put it. “Like you said, Nyathens is the bureaucratic seat of Salafor. Little needed to be built here beyond offices, archives, and lodging for visiting officials. Splash in a few embassies to go with the parks and historic stuff, and you rapidly run out of space. If it got any bigger, I don't think the retrofitted road systems could handle it...”

“An’ the tourists, can't forget all the tourists migratin’ ‘ere to touch all the old stuff.” He added, distinctly pointing at Tobby for that one.

“Please don't remind me,” he frowned, ears flattening with disappointment as he was reminded of his own tourist experience so far. The great library had been a bust, and neither he nor Soapy found that signed laser-sword she spotted… *he really wanted a picture.* He still had the theaters and opera houses to look forward to, so long as they hadn't been perverted into tourist traps like he now feared.

Tobby checked his assistant again, still needing to change his background picture from the adorable bunnies to something Soapy won't tease him about… but they were so cute! He can't! “What's taking everyone so long? It only took me a few minutes to get a shower, change, and comb my fur…” Tobby questioned, looking down at his suit. Mostly simple black, not too basic, and most importantly: ‘free’. Not a soul would know it was secretly the same suit he wore to the rainy-season festival in high school. All he had to do was resize it like he’d done Soapy’s dress… well… nowhere near the same extreme, but still resized. “We won't get shot if we're fashionably late, right?” He smiled sheepishly.

Kaykay visibly wore the ‘I dunno’ before his ability to say the hotel door opening cut him off.

“We're not going to be late. Do you have any idea how difficult it is to get one of these on?” Huffed a certain night-kin, whose voice made Tobby’s head snap her way. Descending the stairs of the hotel’s porte cochère was a creature the likes of which had never blessed Tobby’s senses before. A midnight being of emerald green upon onyx black, of silky mane and glinting eyes, bathed in the glow of both lamp and luna. He couldn’t breathe, only stare, transfixed by one of Shihere’s creations clad in the vestments of a former golden age. Vestments he helped procure so that she’d be as much of a jewel as the dozens woven into the outfit. The matching leg wraps were an unexpected addition, though… *kinda cute actually…*

“Ey, Ey Tobbs…” Kaykay whispered, leaning in and lightly elbowing Tobby. “I’m impressed you got ‘er in a dress too, but pick yer jaw up off the floor ‘fore she starts givin’ you shit.""

Jerking back to reality, he noticed the rest of the crew walking with her. Every leader or syndicate representative invited to the Sabu-kai was allowed to bring ‘a reasonable number’ of ‘guests’ to serve as witnesses or honor guards. In Whisker’s case, that would be BB, Kaykay, Soapy, Tobby, and two more Wiskito soldiers who would be directly attending the gathering. All the rest would be running security and logistics away from the meeting.

Everyone was in nicer-than-average suits, too, except for Soapy and one other shi-kai Tobby he didn't know. It wasn't hard to tell Whisker’s was the leader, given his visible age, fancy cane, and how his whole wardrobe seemed to consist of satin and/or velvet suits. 

“O-Oh good, I was starting to worry. How, uhh… How's it fit?” he asked, sheepishness intensifying as he quickly put his assistant away.

The rest of the crew made their way into the limo-like car, whilst Soapy went right past him. “It feels... Weird, especially around my shoulders,” she said, grumbling like a shi who hadn’t worn something that didn't double as work clothes in over a decade… which she was, to be fair.

Cue BB sitting in the seat behind them with Whiskers, electing to play double duty as both guard and rous gallery. “Am surprized sha managed to make dress fit. Figured it would be easier to sell and just by new one instead.”

“We could have, we could have…” Tobby agreed, lightly tapping his clawed fingers together. “Buuut then Soapy wouldn’t have worn it.”

*‘Mrrp’* she trilled, realizing she was being taken about like she wasn't even there. “Hey!”

“He'z got you there,” BB nodded teasingly from the back seat.

“He does not!” she rebutted, turning around enough to glare at BB, and incidentally give Tobby a look at the origin of her discomfort. ***What in Ardion's ears had she done to the back ribbon?!***

“Soapy… did-” Tobby tried to cut in, but Soapy wasn't having it.

“Why does everyone keep saying I was plotting all this underhanded shit? I’m wearing the dress, aren't I?”

“Maaaaybe becauaze you said so? Repeatedly.. In front of everyone. Would never wear drezz, would never go to prizzy salon, won’t kill rich boy at Sabu-Kai, and yet here you are. Wearing drezz, mane and fur made pretty by salon, and flashing clawz every time someone mentioned Clardoniz. He knowz what you’d do almozt az well as we do.”

“BBs right, He does have you there.” Whiskers chimed, seemingly enjoying the en route… *entertainment*. “Not so easy being the predictable one, now is it?”

“Buh-wh- I am not predictable!” she predictably argued, leaning harder into the seat so she could glare at the two with indignant intent. “I’m only playing along, ‘cause you said I had to be Tobby’s kittensitter, remember? I’d hardly call following orders predictable.”

Ego poked, Tobby had to step in figuratively. “First of all, he asked me to kittensit *you*.”

Her head snapped back with her indignant glare now on Tobby, ready to sass blast, only to be countered with an assertive finger to her snoot. “EH!!” He chastised the same way one would a pet climbing on the kitchen counter.

“Ooooh, sun-kin braver than I thought.” BB chuckled, having not expected Tobby of all shasians to *‘boop the tiger’*.

Would Tobby pay for this later? Probably. Was he going to do it anyways? Yes. “Secondly, did you seriously try to tie the back ribbon yourself? I told you to ask for help. What would we have done if you ripped it?” he asked, trying his hardest not to sound like his mother right now… and failing.

Light batting his hand away from her nose, she still growled. “I got it, didn't I?” aaaand now he understood how his mom felt.

“You practically mangled it.” It wasn't really ‘mangled’ per se, but her knot looked like someone pranced into a knot museum and tried to replicate all the best parts of each one.. Blindfolded and backwards. 

“It's fine!” It was not…

“Just… let me fix it,” he sighed, “before you spend the entire Sabu-kai a cranky mess because the dress is too tight? Or worse, you make an awkward movement and rip it?”

Valid points were valid, sadly, Soapy didn't have one at the ready, and that meant begrudgingly doing what Tobby said. “You are so lucky you’re wearing a seat belt right now,” she glared, threatening him like she usually did when she didn't have ground to stand on. Unfortunately for her, Tobby had grown numb to the idea of violent Soapy-based death.

“Uh-huh, you can push me out the shuttle airlock on the way home if that’ll make you feel better. In the meantime, would you please turn around so I can fix the ribbon? Then see if you're still mad after?” He suggested with a softer tone, trying to be the good guy here. Better to sound like he was trying to help her than attacking the tough shi mental image of herself she so adamantly tried to portray.

He could see in her eyes that she was looking for any kind of sassy comeback that would put her back on top of the conversation, but wasn't finding any. “Fffffine...” she caved, defeatedly. She turned, and her ears drooped back to a point that it could only be a deliberate display of trying to look dejected about it. At least that's what he’d seen Pinky do a few times when she was teaching him the ancient art of ‘overdramatic exaggeration’.

“Try not to leave a trench with how hard you’re dragging your tail about this,” he commented, already inspecting the disaster of a knot closer.

“What was that?” Her ears flicked back up.

“N-Nothing!” He shrank, hastily picking at the insult to knots everywhere. The line between sassy bravery and suicidal stupidity was still a thin one…

“On the subject of ‘nothing,’” Whiskers lightly coughed. “Where’d you find the material to upsize Mrs Kitta’s magnum opus? I doubt there were any bolts of cloth left lying around after her store suffered that ‘timely gas leak’ last night.”

*‘So that's the cover story he’s pushing…’* Tobby thought as he pulled out another segment of the knot. “I didn’t. Everything you see here is part of the original dress.”

Soapy’s ears notably perked up at that, but it was Whiskers who actually voiced the interest. “Oh, well, now I’m just curious. That’s a lot of material to just pull out of nowhere.”

Soapy started to mrowl again…

“I mean uhh…” Whiskers coughed. “Did I say a lot of material? I meant a perfectly reasonable amount of material given how... *small* a shi Mrs Kitta was.”

It was Tobby’s turn to save Whiskers! “About that, you may have noticed the dress looks a bit different than the last time you saw it.”

“Hmm… sleevez are shorter?” BB pointed out.

“Yep, Mrs. Kitta may have had the foresight to include some wiggle room so the dress could be upsized, but it wasn’t anywhere near what I needed. So I had to… *repurpose* other parts of the dress. Trying to keep the patterning lined up was painful, but I managed to preserve most of Mrs. Kitta original vision. I saved pictures of the original design just in case… and for posterity.”

“Aaaand the V down the back? That wasn’t there before?” Whiskers questioned in a knowing tone, hinting at just how scandalously deep it was.

“I was wondering about that…” Soapy added, ears turning back towards Tobby, while he was pulling out another piece of the knot. However, he could see her eyes watching him in the window's reflection, judging him! “It nearly reaches my tail.”

Tobby froze for a moment as he suddenly realized what his executive fashion choices may be getting interpreted as. “I-It's not what you think!” Which, of course, was the worst possible thing he could say at that moment, and he said it just as guiltily as most people normally do. Like someone whose parents just walked in on them going down the ASMR rabbit-hole on one's local hypernet-video sharing site.

“Let me guezz.” BB started, before anyone else was able to jump to… understandable conclusions. “Eating up half the sleevez still didn’t give you enough material to work with, so you cut the V down the back to open it up like a carcazz?”

Tobby blinked as he wasn't hit with some quip about him being some kind of degenerate. “Actually… yes. I kinda had to start over once I had the idea, but it worked. However, since the dress was never designed with that in mind, I didn’t want to risk it... You know… sliding off. So I laced the back up with ribbon kinda like those shoe things the humans wear. The thickness of the ribbon also helped cover up the exposed portions of her back, taking it from ‘Smutty femme fatale’ to ‘classy yet acceptably adventurous.’”

“I question your browser history…” Soapy commented, with increasingly judgmental eyes reflected in the glass.

“Don’t worry about my browser history,” he scoffed, giving the knot a final tug. “The only thing you’ll find there is Wanderlust forums, safe cracking guides, and a very recent search for ‘Huffy night-kins anonymous’.”

“Between all the Midnight Saber’s 3 ranting videos, Beauder-X-Kiliki fanfiction, and tail fetish sites, right?” She shot back, tilting her head back enough to look at him… at least able to catch a glimpse of the top of his ears.

He retied the ribbon into the only knot he knew how to tie... A nice little present bow at the base of her neck, which he found oddly fitting. He needn’t mention the intrusive thoughts about garroting her with said ribbon until she apologized for that last comment… Not yet.

But it was Tobby’s turn to be the upset one. He looked back at BB and Whiskers. “Can I throw her out of the car?”

Whiskers chuckled while BB smirked and shrugged dismissively. “We won’t stop you from trying.”

Tobby then turned to Kaykay up in the driver’s seat. “Kaykay can you stop at the nearest bridge? Preferably with a long drop and no water under it?”

He looked back, eyes off the road again as the car started to lightly swerve. “Sorry kid, ain't a bridge between here and the meetin’.”

“Darn.” Tobby gave an exaggerated sigh of defeat, “I’ll have to settle for the shuttle air-lock then.” Sarcasm spent, he slipped back into his seat proper. “In the meantime. How does it feel now?” He asked, turning an ear back towards Soapy.

“A… lot better, actually…” She said, sounding admittedly impressed as she rolled her shoulders and wiggled a bit in her seat. “It’s not squeezing anymore, and I can twist my torso again.”

“Whatever you did to tie the ribbon bunched it up, while the rest below barely adjusted at all. If the tightness changes when you go to stand up, just tell me and I'll fix it,” he stated, knowing full well he was the only one the Wiskitos brought along who COULD fix the dress should anything go wrong.

It was quiet, too quiet… Soapy would normally have tried to hit him with another comeback by now for threatening to throw her out of the car, but she was silent. “Thank you, I’ll just… Let you tie it next time,” she said, which honestly surprised Tobby. No jaunting, sass, sarcastic tone… just a flat, meaningful-sounding moment of gratitude.

This couldn't be real… The last time he heard her sound that genuine was when they talked about ‘breaking her toys’ and- *Ooooohhh…* She was actually swallowing her urge to be the ‘victor’ in every scenario just to show some appreciation. How… how was he supposed to process that!? “You’re uhh… Welcome?” Never mind, now he had to process just how awkward that came out. 

“Glad to see you two are finally getting along.” Whiskers chimed with a light clap. “Just in time, too. We're almost there.”

Tobby turned to look out the window. He'd been wondering where such a grand event was going to be held for a while now. It's a ton of high-profile and dangerous individuals gathered in one place to plot, scheme, and preferably plan to kill each other less often. What kind of venue could house such a gathering? Maybe an old opera house, or a convention center or… he paused, blinking very slowly before turning to look back at Whiskers again. “Why are we back at the great library?”

—

*‘Nobody suspects the library,’*

A phrase Ambassador Movva mimed aloud as she took in the grand ballroom. The vast space resembled something from the palaces of the ancient city-states—white paneling with gold filigree between pillars. The columns were identical to the ones in the great library above them, but had cracks carved into them, and painted in with a blue she assumed was lapis-lazuli.

The design led one’s eyes upward to the ceiling, sprinkled with ornate chandeliers, casting their warm glow over the sea of frescoes that covered every inch of the domed ceiling. Depictions of outraged great thinkers with jewels spilling through the claws of one hand while pointing at distant cities with another, of thieves haloed with holy symbols descending upon temples, and of golden cities set ablaze with caravans of plunder spilling from broken gates like entrails. A classical monument dedicated to every great *‘redistribution of wealth’* in Shasian history… and that was just the ceiling!

This was not the kind of meeting she expected to be attending when she meandered her way through college, slept through her classes, and went to every party. But after five years, she got a diploma in the mail with a congratulatory letter for being one of the few people on Salafor to accrue the diverse credits needed for an ambassadorial degree. *Whoops!*

She’d been sure she had at least one more year of hard partying left in her before she’d drop out and get a normal job like everyone else, buuut… Life is funny that way. Now she was an ambassador to their most recently arrived galactic neighbor, humanity. And she was confident she only got offered the job because her cousin already had a ship she could use and the *Mercanti* wanted to save money. She’d submitted her application on a whim!

So why was she and a gaggle of governing tribes representatives at the largest criminal gathering in this corner of the galaxy? Well, some very jaded individuals might say it's because the governing tribes would fit in perfectly at such a gathering… to which they’d be correct.

For Ambassador Movva, she was here because this was also the largest gathering of humans outside of human space. A golden opportunity to interact with members of the species that had no governmental loyalties, outside their enigmatic ‘Guild’.

Pirates, drug lords, mafiosos, and slightly more organized than average gangland warlords gathered here, but the humans filled the recently imperiled yet critical role of ‘smugglers’.

After the few trips she’s made to human space thus far, Movva came to understand that this Guild of theirs was the closest thing humanity had to a species-spanning organization. And if she wanted to get in contact with the Guild, she needed to play nice with the smugglers. She’d met a few already, nice ones too. One sold her the sequin amber dress she wore that night, and another helped get a relationship thing going between her and her, admittedly adorable comms officer, Jek.

Humming innocently, she yoinked a narrow wine glass from a passing server and elected to watch the arrivals. Browsing for easy prey to sink her diplomatic and/or door-opening claws into was technically her job after all. 

*‘Something, something, watch and learn, something something, kittensit science officer Fenna as she does her social experiments, and uhh.. don’t drink so much that I wake up in a hotel, wondering where this cute dress went. Yeah... that's a good mission statement. Really emphasize how much restraint I'm showing by NOT getting pretty-shi wasted.’* She thought, as her pink tail flicked behind her. She *totally* knew what she was doing… she had the degree after all! Fake it ‘till you make it!

*‘That reminds me…’* she hummed internally as she began to shift her way through the growing crowd for a better view of the entrance. *‘If my totally not intrusive pinging of Tobby’s assistant with one of those cheating sites is correct.. He should be arriving any second now. And possibly with that shi ‘coworker’ he seemed so flustered about.’* She really needed to show him how to turn the GPS off…

**“Introducing!!”** Announced the introduction guy as he had done dozens of times already. ***“The Venerable Whiskers of the Wiskitos!*** *And company…*”

Movva blinked as she saw an elderly sha with ironically large and crumpled whiskers enter the room. What phenotype was he...? She couldn't tell. He was just so grey, and average..’ and old! Blatantly rich though, given the expensive-ass suit, and fancy cane… Respected, too, if the few polite cheers and excited greetings were anything to go by.

With him was… a dopey-looking plains-kin that probably thinks he’s a badass but can't keep his eyes off the nearest shi’s tail. Another was a… towering mud-dragon of a sun-kin. Dear gods, they built him **thick**. He’s got more muscle in one arm than she probably has in both her legs! Damn, she’d fight or even hit on that guy if it weren’t for Jek being such a lovable bean… not being single is hard, damn it! *… gods, am I really this shallow?*

Then came the sha she’d been looking for. She’d recognize that tall-eared, lanky history buff anywhere, even in a crowd like this. No matter what he was wearing ei- “Sweet Xoso fucking me raw, is that his old festival suit!?” She exclaimed aloud, facepalming and earning a few awkward steps away from the nearby guests.

Woe, woe is Pinky for being the only one here who could recognize her lifelong friend cheaped-out on buying a new suit, ***for the crime convention!!*** *‘He has crime money now! Would it have killed him to buy a new damn suit?!’*

By the time she recovered from the category three cringe, she pulled her face out of her hand to see.. See….

*(Author's note: RecordSkip.mp3)*

What **was** she seeing right now? She had to blink a few times, as her poor Xoso-given brain ran into some cascading logic errors. Sure, Tobby looked as awestruck as a kitten in a glitter factory seeing the room, that much was expected. The last thing she expected was the ***GODS DAMN NIGHT-KIN SHI*** that came in after him wearing old motha-fucking Kitta’s prize dress?! And he was smiling? Pointing out the frescoes to her and going on one of his excited little history tangents?!

The math wasn't mathing, the pasta wasn’t noodling, the rous were eating tigers, nothing Movva knew made sense anymore! She was glad she hadn’t taken a sip of the wine she yoinked, cause it would have ended up all over a nearby guest. *‘Last time I checked, he was still absolutely pants pissing afraid of night-kin. What the flying fuck-a-duck happened while I was gone?!’*",4,1761210312.0,HFY,6,1.0,False

Can we say dating scene in India(Mumbai) seems pretty dry these days, with people mostly relying on dating apps to meet potential partners. While these apps help connect people, it often feels like a shallow experience, where decisions are made based on a few pictures and a short bio. You chat for a bit, but there’s no real “vibe” check—everything is filtered and curated. I think we’re missing out on the more natural, organic ways of meeting people.

What if we tried a different approach? Instead of depending solely on dating apps, why not meet people in person, just based on age or mutual interests, and go for a simple hangout—a casual coffee, a walk, or something low-pressure. No apps, no swiping, just the chance to see how you feel after a real-world interaction. It’s all about seeing if there’s a natural vibe without the anxiety of online profiles and endless texting. After that, you can decide whether to continue or part ways.

This could change the way we date entirely, shifting the focus from matches and algorithms to authentic in-person chemistry. It’s not about blind dating in the traditional sense, but more about taking a chance and embracing spontaneity. What do you think? Could this kind of approach work, or does the idea seem too risky in today’s world?

Crazy idea or smart move?,"Hey, I (M, Bangalore) am trying to improve my communication and social skills, since I genuinely believe they’re among the most valuable and timeless skills one can have.

I currently have a decent-paying weekday desk job, but it doesn’t offer much opportunity for casual interaction. Switching industries isn’t really an option for me right now, so I’ve been thinking - would working part-time at a coffee shop on weekends be a good way to practice and improve these skills?

I have good command of English, and I’d prefer to develop my communication abilities through getting outside in the world than say practicing in front of a mirror/ by myself.

Do you think weekend work in a customer facing role would help? And if so, are there places (like cafes or similar establishments) that would be open to take on people just for weekends?

I also have a base in both Dubai and India, which could help with flexibility in operations, cost efficiency, and time zone advantages.

	•	How to source clients — whether through Upwork, LinkedIn, partnerships, or other organic channels
	•	Any first-hand experiences or success stories from people who’ve done something similar

If anyone here has explored or is currently working in this space, I’d love to connect — maybe even catch up for a coffee if you’re in Dubai! ☕

Everyone has their own desk and most of us bring our own mugs or cups for coffee. A few months ago, my best friend gave me this ceramic mug with a small hand painted sunflower design. It’s nothing fancy or expensive but it’s sentimental she made it herself before moving overseas. Last week I came in and saw *my mug* sitting on another coworker’s desk let’s call her M. There was still coffee in it. When I asked her about it, she casually said, Oh sorry I just grabbed whichever one was clean. Didn’t think it mattered.

1ody30d,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1ody30d/this_is_a_true_story_its_a_part_of_my_story/,"This is a true story, it’s a part of my story, wanted to share. Fake names used.","Beautiful idea:        

When I was 13, I was admitted to a psychiatric ward for a little under a month. I was suicidal, and as you can probably imagine, a girl that age with those thoughts doesn’t feel like socializing very much.
But there was this girl. Her name is Ellena. She was the only one I remember talking to.

It’s been five years now, and the memories of that time fade so quickly, as the brain tries to process what happened. But I still see ellena sometimes. We still smile and wave, after all these years. 

It used to always be a quick smile as we passed each other in our city. A little acknowledgment. Nothing more. Never any talking. But the last time I saw her was at the bar I always go to with my friends. I said hi as my intoxication allowed me to and smiled, and she said, “So you actually do remember me?” to which I of course replied that I did — of course I did.

She was the only other girl there who wasn’t admitted because of an eating disorder. I can’t remember if we ever talked about why we were there, but she was the only one I opened up to. I don’t remember it in detail, but there was one evening when we sat watching Politijagt, talking. I remember we talked so late that one of the staff had to come and tell us to go to bed. Maybe, in another life, we would have been friends.

That’s why I was so happy when she replied to me with, “Oh good, I told my friends that you are hannah (me).” Just the thought that I’m someone she remembers… whether our conversations made any difference is hard to say, but I’m so deeply glad that she remembers me.

There’s always a strange feeling of nostalgia whenever I see her. As if a part of me was seen by her , a part from a completely different place, a life heading in an ugly direction, where we met each other right there in limbo, between daily life and the exhaustion of everything.

We were in a place that many never experience, at a crossroads that many never walk. A fragment of two lives that hides itself in our short time together.

Whether I’ll ever have a longer conversation with her than that, I don’t know. But the thought that we will always say hi will always do something very special to me. It’s as if it makes me think about how beautiful the human experience can be.

She and I met, and we have a significance that, after five years, still makes us look each other in the eyes. We help each other acknowledge a time that not even the closest people can bring back. I’m never gonna go grap a coffee with her, or have a “how are you doing”. That’s never where our relationship is.

It’s beautiful to be human, even when it’s ugly. We should never underestimate what people do for us — even those we don’t talk to. Even those who remain just a beautiful idea.",4,1761209186.0,writers,3,0.84,False

I am exclusively BF currently and just began to introduce pacifiers mostly during diaper changes. To help him chill during them so I don’t need to rush to get my boob out for him. 
We are waiting for us to gain confidence in a feeding routine and for me to build up a small stash in the freezer before we try to introduce bottles for a few of the afternoon feeds. (So far my stash is going great I’m on day 3-4 of collecting passively on the non feeding side and manage to get about 4-8oz ever 24 hours. Iv got 4 bags frozen of 4-5.5 oz each.) 

Besides the point. 

I just feel like I’m loosing my mind, realistically is it a bad idea to try and take my 7 day old out for breakfast at a small coffee shop with my husband. Iv been jealous that he has been able to do Walmart runs and do laundry, normally that was our thing we were a team unit and I get that we still are he is doing that solo so I can focus on our newborn but my lifestyle has flipped on a dime.
 
I knew what I signed up for when we were TTC but I guess I’m getting a dose of reality check with a good mix of hormones. 

If he doesn’t leave the stroller other than for feeding or changes do you think it is a bad idea? Is it just too soon? I live in the very northern part of Wisconsin so it’s not like I can just go and sit outside with him. It was nearly snowing out yesterday afternoon.

He first suggested a coffee shop, then changed it to a mall nearby since he needed to shop for shoes. I agreed and I gave him a heads up prior and told him that I will be dressed super casual-legging, sweat shirt and uggs; since I was leaving a nail appointment. As I arrived at the mall, I asked for his location-he told me exactly where he was at and directed me to him. As I walked towards him, he quickly walked off to my opposite direction, behind a massive pole went up the stairs and vanished. Soon blocking me on everything without any explanation. 
Three years later, he “liked” me on a dating app looking drastically older-balding and heavier. At first I denied it because he looked absolutely hideous but then I thought what if I did the same to him.
How much of a fool does need to be to not remember me or what he did to me. (We are both from a distinctive background)
He asked for my number, I provided him with a fake number to text me on and blocked him on the dating app. I’ve been casually chatting with him, tweaking a few details here and there for him to not suddenly remember who I am but I am planning on scheduling a date with him, to not show up and blocking him without any explanation-like what he did to me.

1odxqur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1odxqur/i_am_a_paranormal_research_agent_this_is_my_story/,"I am a Paranormal Research Agent, this is my story. Case #002 ""The Shadow Man""","Hello all, I want to thank those who read my previous statement and are back to read more of my findings. For those who didn't read my previous post, I am a research agent for an organisation that I'm not allowed to name, and I've been given permission to post (albeit censored) statements of some of my findings.

I am doing this in the hopes that, well, something will be left of me if I don't keep ahead of what's hunting me.

Anyways, the story begins a few months after the bus incident. Me and Lily were being punished for using a very rare and very expensive piece of equipment, and our punishment was what we like to call in the biz “campfire duty”.

My organisation specialises in the investigation and regulation of any and all paranormal entities, sites or events; we have our ear to the ground and finger in every pie. This makes it so we are capable of investigating as many myths or legends as possible to verify if they're genuine.

This also includes all of the stories that are clearly made up and are told to spook teenagers; this is campfire duty. And it's horribly embarrassing.

I won't go into what we investigated, but to anyone who likes spreading urban legends about ghosts that appear when you drive along roads late at night, I hope you realise how much time you waste for some poor research agent who actually has to drive up and down that road for hours multiple nights a week.

It was early in the morning when I first got to work, an unlabelled office building in a part of a central business district that you'd never notice. I had a coffee in my hand and a filled-out dossier in the other; it was for an urban legend that could finally be filed under “Myth”. I got to my desk cubicle and discovered that another dossier was left on my keyboard.

A new assignment before I even submitted the one in my hands, I finished the coffee and sat in my chair to begin reading.

“The Shadow Man” was a Type A Spectre who roams around the halls of a “Springview motel”. This was shaping up to be another campfire case, but you have to do what you have to do.

A few hours later, Lily and I were driving down a highway in the middle of an empty open field that stretched out indefinitely.

“I’m sick of this, Lily. If they want us running around chasing chickens, they should at least make them interesting. This shadow man,"" I said, almost scoffing when saying the name, ""doesn't even sound original,"" I continued.

""If you hate it so much, why don't you leave?"" she responded in a nonchalant tone. I often forgot that our roles within the organisation were very different. I was free to complain about the assignments I'd been put on, and I was also free to quit at any time. Lily didn't have that freedom.

It was a good question, one I didn't have an answer to. Before things got awkward, we pulled off of the road and into the car park of a nice-looking motel.

""Y'know, in terms of chickens to chase, this doesn't seem that bad; it might even just be an all-expenses-paid holiday,"" Lily said with a slight sense of excitement in her voice.

We got out of the car and walked to the entry of the motel. Sitting behind the front desk was an early twenties guy playing something on his phone. I walked up and placed my hand on the counter.

""Hi, we've got two rooms booked under a Mr Moore,"" I said. The staff member looked up at me from his phone and had a visibly annoyed look.

""Yeah, let me check,"" he said slowly as he shifted to the computer beside him. After a moment, he scanned some keycards and placed them on the desk. ""Please enjoy your stay,"" he added before jumping back onto his phone.

We walked up a flight of stairs and found our rooms. They were next to each other like always; it was the usual setup: twin-sized bed, desk, small kitchenette and bathroom.

I set my bag at the foot of the bed and took a seat atop it. I had my dossier in my hands and read over the specifics: a ""Shadowman"" would appear when you least expect and take people. I groaned at the cheesiness. A few hours had passed, and the sun had long since set. Lily was in my room, and we were, for all intents and purposes, just shooting the shit.

We had ordered pizza, and Lily had driven out and bought some beer; to be fair to her, things were shaping up to just being a vacation paid for by the organisation. something we both desperately needed.

Eventually Lily called it a night, and I got into some pyjamas and went into the bathroom to brush my teeth. The bathroom wasn't the best, but I've also been in worse. Imagine a shitty tub and shower curtain, a brown toilet and a sink with a mirror-shelf cabinet just above it.

I wet my toothbrush and began to scrub my teeth. I spat my spit back into the sink and looked in the mirror and realised something: there was a handprint on the other side of the shower curtain.

My heart sank, but I remembered my training. I turned around and kept my eyes on it. The handprint was slowly moving closer, as if whoever was on the other side was reaching out to me.

""Shit,"" I whispered in an instinctual slip.

As I said this, Silent black flames burst from behind the shower curtain, licking up the walls. No heat. No light. Just darkness moving like fire. I ran to the door and almost threw myself through it. I dove for my bag. The bathroom was an inferno of silent abyss, black fire licking the air. dancing atop each other, whilst a man made of black flames stepped out from behind the shower curtain slowly.

""FUCK!"" I remember screaming at the top of my lungs as the shadow man turned its head towards me. I grabbed out a small bag of silver halide, poured it into my hand, and threw it at the shadow man, but it fell through him.

The black flames had begun to spread into my motel room, and I began to run to my motel door. As I reached for the door, the flames shot up the doorframe, and I jumped at the sudden movement. The flames remained silent, and the sound of my heart beating may very well have been the loudest thing in the room.

As the shadow man advanced, my breath caught in my throat. Suddenly, the motel door slammed open. Lily burst inside, her hands thrust forward like a shield. The dark figure recoiled, its fiery form folding in on itself, retreating back into the bathroom’s shadows.

Lily was swooning on her feet, and I leapt forward to grab her as she fell, and I dragged us both out of the room. I dragged her to her car, and as soon as we entered, she fell asleep. I was in no mood to re-enter the motel room, so I joined her.

The next morning we got breakfast at a diner a few minutes' drive down the road. It was awkward and tense, but I thought we needed to debrief about our situation.

""So what do you think that was last night?"" I asked sheepishly.

""The fucking shadowman, I guess,"" she responded before taking a deep sip of her orange juice. I took note that it wasn't coffee.

""How did you know to come and help me? The fire wasn't hot or noisy. I know I shouted a bit, but surely not that loud,"" I said as jokingly as I could, which rewarded me with a smile.

""First off, yeah, you do scream that loud; secondly, I don't know how I couldn't have felt it. It felt like a bomb went off in my head,"" she finished with a head shake. ""Whatever this is, Elijah is strong,"" she continued, which I shook my head in agreement with.

""Yeah, it didn't even flinch at a handful of silver halide,"" I confessed.

She looked at me again. ""How many things do you know that can do that?"" she asked, already knowing the answer.

""Not many, not your usual type A spectre at least,"" I said. A waitress walked up to our table and placed our breakfasts in front of us: eggs on toast with a side of beans for me and banana pancakes for Lily. I must've been giving her a look because she spoke up and said, ""Shut up. The last time I had to use that much energy was when we were on the bus, coincidentally when I was saving your ass again.""

I shot her a playful look and took a sip of my coffee.

""Okay, so type A are just basic apparitions, right?"" Lily said in inbetween mouthfulls of pancakes.

""Yeah, usually your normal ghost archetype, humanoid, glowing, translucent,"" I said whilst cutting my toast.

""Right,"" she said whilst pointing a fork at me; the fork had a banana on the end of it.

""Elijah, that thing only fell under one of those; it's a stretch to call it a type A, and it's nowhere near a type P,"" she added.

""Ok, so what are you saying? This is something new?"" I said, confused,

""No, not at all. In this line of work you'll learn that there is never anything new, just things we haven't learnt of yet. What I'm saying is that I don't think this thing comes from a soul like a spectre would; I think it's something else,"" she added before chewing down another mixture of banana, pancake, chocolate and orange juice.

""Ok, so what do you propose?"" I asked.

""I don't know at the moment; I have some questions I want to ask, like why did it target you on the very first night?, Usually they spend as much time scoping us out as we scope them, but we have to practise the Heinz tried-and-true method of throwing whatever we have at it night after night until we understand that bastard,"" she said before presenting her newly finished plate of pancakes.  

Eight long, excruciating nights of nothing; the Shadowman had gone silent, and if it wasn't for Lily also seeing him, I would've begun to believe that I imagined the whole thing. I couldn't help but feel that throughout those long 8 nights a sense of being watched, like I had never felt like I was truly alone in that place.

I felt more comfortable being alone within the motel, and I was allocated the very noble role of ""vending machine trader"", which meant I'd just go and get us snacks whenever we were both hungry. I honestly think that motel may have seen more revenue from their vending machine in the time we were there than the entire time they were open.

We'd both seen flickers of black flames appearing and disappearing throughout this period of time, but we both couldn't confidently say if it was reality or a trick conjured by our minds; living off of fumes you don't have and rarely sleeping can do cruel things to your psyche. In my line of work, trusting what your gut tells you is real is incredibly important, so I can't genuinely say if the black embers were real or not. It doesn't really impact much, I guess.

I didn't sleep much that week; the times when I did sleep, I would need to borrow Lily's car and drive somewhere else. For the time I did try to sleep in the motel, I dreamt of the flames and the Shadowman. He was engulfed in the silent fire, and he was always wanting something from me, but I could never guess what. Lily woke me up before anything happened and began to sleep in her car.

I was on vending machine duty on the ninth night of our investigation, and I passed the staff member behind the front desk. He was playing on his phone like usual and didn't acknowledge me, like usual. It was past 2 a.m.; I couldn’t blame him for looking half-dead. I grabbed a bottle of cola and chips and grabbed Lily her cookies and mineral water.

After the drinks popped out, I realised that the hair on my arms was standing up and I had a gut feeling that something was wrong, which in my line of work is a good indicator that something is wrong. I shot my head up and looked around me and saw it: the staff member behind the front desk was slumped back in his chair, and he was being engulfed in a quiet black flame… In one moment he was there, and the next it had consumed him whole; he was gone.

""Dammit!"" I shouted and dropped the supplies from the vending machine. I ran immediately to the stairs that led to the motel rooms to meet back up with Lily. As I reached the bottom of the stairs, I stepped into a dark spot in the room. It was 2 am, so it didn't look out of place, but as I stepped into it, I realised my mistake. A black arm made of fire shot out and gripped me by the throat and pulled me into the darkness, and everything went numb.

I was falling in the darkness, although it wasn't dark; I could make out each black ember around me in crisp detail, and I felt like I was experiencing everything through a state of tunnel vision and extreme focus.

I felt confused and foggy about what was happening, and I remember an extreme feeling of calm whilst I fell in this world of fire.

Suddenly my calm was disturbed by a flickering of light. I looked towards it, and it seemed to peel back the fire around it. I could see the silhouette of someone in that light, but I couldn't recognise who.

""Elijah…"" the voice cried out.

""Elijah, please…"" it continued.

It took me a second to realise that it was talking about me. ,

""Elijah, come to me please, for God's sake,"" the voice cried out once more.

I trusted the voice, and although I was falling, I felt the strength to move. I tried to swim in this abyss, and to my shock, I was able to move closer to the light.

""Yes, Elijah, keep coming,"" the voice shouted before crying out in pain. Suddenly the fire violently swarmed around the light, and I felt a resounding amount of hate from all around me. The silhouette dropped to her knees, and I continued to push myself forward even though it had become much harder.

I reached the ever-shrinking light and thrust my hand out and let it engulf me. In a moment I was in that realm of fire, and in the next I was at the motel lobby being flung across the room. Lily was flung a few feet away from me, and she looked exhausted. I looked towards the shadow that I had come out from and saw the Shadowman stepping out; silent black flames erupted off of him, and he seemed much angrier now. With every step flames shot out from his foot and infected the surrounding area; he was engulfing the entire motel. The air was cold despite the flames, and a faint smell of burnt sulfur filled my nostrils.

I got to my feet and ran to Lily. She was awake but not entirely well. I scooped her up and ran out of the lobby, the Shadowman not far behind us. As we reached her car, I threw her into the back seat and dived for the steering wheel.

I tried to turn on the ignition but froze as I realised that I didn't know where her keys were.

""FUCK!"" I shouted as I scrambled my hands all across her car to find her keys. After a moment, I looked up and saw it. The Shadow Man stood across the car park from us. I was terrified. We stared at one another for what felt like an eternity, then it clicked: he isn't moving.

He was bound to the motel, ofcourse how stupid could I be?

As I was thinking this, a spiky object hit the back of my head. I yelped in fear before looking down and seeing that they were Lily's car keys; she had thrown them at me. A second later we were speeding out of that parking lot and making our way into town.

The next morning we were back at the diner; I had my eggs, toast and beans, and Lily had her pancakes.

""So you just happened to step into the one shadow the Shadow Man was hiding in."" Lily said in a teasing voice, ""You really are the stupidest research agent in the history of research agents,"" she said before taking a scoop of ice cream and eating it. Today she asked for ice cream as well as banana pancakes as a reward for saving my life again.

""Yeah, and what happened to you, oh great hero?"" I said in a similarly mocking tone.

""Simple, I saw your sorry ass being pulled into the shadows and thought that if there was a way in, I could definitely open that way back up. It took a hell of a lot out of me, though; you put me through way too much, Wiltburrow,"" she said whilst waving her fork around. No banana today. I didn't tell her that I heard what she said or how concerned she really sounded.

""Ok, well, thank you. I owe you my life again. Let's move on. It looks like the Shadowman is bound to the hotel; it's not a spectre, and we can't exorcise what we don't know,"" I said.

""It seems like the motel is the issue,"" Lily said offhandedly.

""Yeah, well, it's not like we can get rid of the motel,"" I said. I looked at her and saw excitement in her eyes. It is surprisingly easy to wave around a badge and say that you need to evacuate a motel and then ""accidentally"" set it on fire; it only took a couple of hours to burn, and with most people evacuated, the fire department didn't learn about it until it was too late. It's fitting in a way: the Shadowman, a creature engulfed in black fire, is laid to rest in a blaze of glory.

Although I felt a lingering shiver on the site, we decided that after an extra week of surveillance that our job was finished here; officially the case remained open in case of more sightings, but unofficially it was out of our hands.

So do remember, if you find yourself staying at motels and decide to steer away from the light after sundown, do make sure you don't step too far into the shadows.",2,1761207825.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False
1odxqgu,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1odxqgu/i_am_a_paranormal_research_agent_this_is_my_story/,"I am a Paranormal Research Agent, this is my story. Case #002 ""The Shadow Man""","Hello all, I want to thank those who read my previous statement and are back to read more of my findings. For those who didn't read my previous post, I am a research agent for an organisation that I'm not allowed to name, and I've been given permission to post (albeit censored) statements of some of my findings.

I am doing this in the hopes that, well, something will be left of me if I don't keep ahead of what's hunting me.

Anyways, the story begins a few months after the bus incident. Me and Lily were being punished for using a very rare and very expensive piece of equipment, and our punishment was what we like to call in the biz “campfire duty”.

My organisation specialises in the investigation and regulation of any and all paranormal entities, sites or events; we have our ear to the ground and finger in every pie. This makes it so we are capable of investigating as many myths or legends as possible to verify if they're genuine.

This also includes all of the stories that are clearly made up and are told to spook teenagers; this is campfire duty. And it's horribly embarrassing.

I won't go into what we investigated, but to anyone who likes spreading urban legends about ghosts that appear when you drive along roads late at night, I hope you realise how much time you waste for some poor research agent who actually has to drive up and down that road for hours multiple nights a week.

It was early in the morning when I first got to work, an unlabelled office building in a part of a central business district that you'd never notice. I had a coffee in my hand and a filled-out dossier in the other; it was for an urban legend that could finally be filed under “Myth”. I got to my desk cubicle and discovered that another dossier was left on my keyboard.

A new assignment before I even submitted the one in my hands, I finished the coffee and sat in my chair to begin reading.

“The Shadow Man” was a Type A Spectre who roams around the halls of a “Springview motel”. This was shaping up to be another campfire case, but you have to do what you have to do.

A few hours later, Lily and I were driving down a highway in the middle of an empty open field that stretched out indefinitely.

“I’m sick of this, Lily. If they want us running around chasing chickens, they should at least make them interesting. This shadow man,"" I said, almost scoffing when saying the name, ""doesn't even sound original,"" I continued.

""If you hate it so much, why don't you leave?"" she responded in a nonchalant tone. I often forgot that our roles within the organisation were very different. I was free to complain about the assignments I'd been put on, and I was also free to quit at any time. Lily didn't have that freedom.

It was a good question, one I didn't have an answer to. Before things got awkward, we pulled off of the road and into the car park of a nice-looking motel.

""Y'know, in terms of chickens to chase, this doesn't seem that bad; it might even just be an all-expenses-paid holiday,"" Lily said with a slight sense of excitement in her voice.

We got out of the car and walked to the entry of the motel. Sitting behind the front desk was an early twenties guy playing something on his phone. I walked up and placed my hand on the counter.

""Hi, we've got two rooms booked under a Mr Moore,"" I said. The staff member looked up at me from his phone and had a visibly annoyed look.

""Yeah, let me check,"" he said slowly as he shifted to the computer beside him. After a moment, he scanned some keycards and placed them on the desk. ""Please enjoy your stay,"" he added before jumping back onto his phone.

We walked up a flight of stairs and found our rooms. They were next to each other like always; it was the usual setup: twin-sized bed, desk, small kitchenette and bathroom.

I set my bag at the foot of the bed and took a seat atop it. I had my dossier in my hands and read over the specifics: a ""Shadowman"" would appear when you least expect and take people. I groaned at the cheesiness. A few hours had passed, and the sun had long since set. Lily was in my room, and we were, for all intents and purposes, just shooting the shit.

We had ordered pizza, and Lily had driven out and bought some beer; to be fair to her, things were shaping up to just being a vacation paid for by the organisation. something we both desperately needed.

Eventually Lily called it a night, and I got into some pyjamas and went into the bathroom to brush my teeth. The bathroom wasn't the best, but I've also been in worse. Imagine a shitty tub and shower curtain, a brown toilet and a sink with a mirror-shelf cabinet just above it.

I wet my toothbrush and began to scrub my teeth. I spat my spit back into the sink and looked in the mirror and realised something: there was a handprint on the other side of the shower curtain.

My heart sank, but I remembered my training. I turned around and kept my eyes on it. The handprint was slowly moving closer, as if whoever was on the other side was reaching out to me.

""Shit,"" I whispered in an instinctual slip.

As I said this, Silent black flames burst from behind the shower curtain, licking up the walls. No heat. No light. Just darkness moving like fire. I ran to the door and almost threw myself through it. I dove for my bag. The bathroom was an inferno of silent abyss, black fire licking the air. dancing atop each other, whilst a man made of black flames stepped out from behind the shower curtain slowly.

""FUCK!"" I remember screaming at the top of my lungs as the shadow man turned its head towards me. I grabbed out a small bag of silver halide, poured it into my hand, and threw it at the shadow man, but it fell through him.

The black flames had begun to spread into my motel room, and I began to run to my motel door. As I reached for the door, the flames shot up the doorframe, and I jumped at the sudden movement. The flames remained silent, and the sound of my heart beating may very well have been the loudest thing in the room.

As the shadow man advanced, my breath caught in my throat. Suddenly, the motel door slammed open. Lily burst inside, her hands thrust forward like a shield. The dark figure recoiled, its fiery form folding in on itself, retreating back into the bathroom’s shadows.

Lily was swooning on her feet, and I leapt forward to grab her as she fell, and I dragged us both out of the room. I dragged her to her car, and as soon as we entered, she fell asleep. I was in no mood to re-enter the motel room, so I joined her.

The next morning we got breakfast at a diner a few minutes' drive down the road. It was awkward and tense, but I thought we needed to debrief about our situation.

""So what do you think that was last night?"" I asked sheepishly.

""The fucking shadowman, I guess,"" she responded before taking a deep sip of her orange juice. I took note that it wasn't coffee.

""How did you know to come and help me? The fire wasn't hot or noisy. I know I shouted a bit, but surely not that loud,"" I said as jokingly as I could, which rewarded me with a smile.

""First off, yeah, you do scream that loud; secondly, I don't know how I couldn't have felt it. It felt like a bomb went off in my head,"" she finished with a head shake. ""Whatever this is, Elijah is strong,"" she continued, which I shook my head in agreement with.

""Yeah, it didn't even flinch at a handful of silver halide,"" I confessed.

She looked at me again. ""How many things do you know that can do that?"" she asked, already knowing the answer.

""Not many, not your usual type A spectre at least,"" I said. A waitress walked up to our table and placed our breakfasts in front of us: eggs on toast with a side of beans for me and banana pancakes for Lily. I must've been giving her a look because she spoke up and said, ""Shut up. The last time I had to use that much energy was when we were on the bus, coincidentally when I was saving your ass again.""

I shot her a playful look and took a sip of my coffee.

""Okay, so type A are just basic apparitions, right?"" Lily said in inbetween mouthfulls of pancakes.

""Yeah, usually your normal ghost archetype, humanoid, glowing, translucent,"" I said whilst cutting my toast.

""Right,"" she said whilst pointing a fork at me; the fork had a banana on the end of it.

""Elijah, that thing only fell under one of those; it's a stretch to call it a type A, and it's nowhere near a type P,"" she added.

""Ok, so what are you saying? This is something new?"" I said, confused,

""No, not at all. In this line of work you'll learn that there is never anything new, just things we haven't learnt of yet. What I'm saying is that I don't think this thing comes from a soul like a spectre would; I think it's something else,"" she added before chewing down another mixture of banana, pancake, chocolate and orange juice.

""Ok, so what do you propose?"" I asked.

""I don't know at the moment; I have some questions I want to ask, like why did it target you on the very first night?, Usually they spend as much time scoping us out as we scope them, but we have to practise the Heinz tried-and-true method of throwing whatever we have at it night after night until we understand that bastard,"" she said before presenting her newly finished plate of pancakes.  

Eight long, excruciating nights of nothing; the Shadowman had gone silent, and if it wasn't for Lily also seeing him, I would've begun to believe that I imagined the whole thing. I couldn't help but feel that throughout those long 8 nights a sense of being watched, like I had never felt like I was truly alone in that place.

I felt more comfortable being alone within the motel, and I was allocated the very noble role of ""vending machine trader"", which meant I'd just go and get us snacks whenever we were both hungry. I honestly think that motel may have seen more revenue from their vending machine in the time we were there than the entire time they were open.

We'd both seen flickers of black flames appearing and disappearing throughout this period of time, but we both couldn't confidently say if it was reality or a trick conjured by our minds; living off of fumes you don't have and rarely sleeping can do cruel things to your psyche. In my line of work, trusting what your gut tells you is real is incredibly important, so I can't genuinely say if the black embers were real or not. It doesn't really impact much, I guess.

I didn't sleep much that week; the times when I did sleep, I would need to borrow Lily's car and drive somewhere else. For the time I did try to sleep in the motel, I dreamt of the flames and the Shadowman. He was engulfed in the silent fire, and he was always wanting something from me, but I could never guess what. Lily woke me up before anything happened and began to sleep in her car.

I was on vending machine duty on the ninth night of our investigation, and I passed the staff member behind the front desk. He was playing on his phone like usual and didn't acknowledge me, like usual. It was past 2 a.m.; I couldn’t blame him for looking half-dead. I grabbed a bottle of cola and chips and grabbed Lily her cookies and mineral water.

After the drinks popped out, I realised that the hair on my arms was standing up and I had a gut feeling that something was wrong, which in my line of work is a good indicator that something is wrong. I shot my head up and looked around me and saw it: the staff member behind the front desk was slumped back in his chair, and he was being engulfed in a quiet black flame… In one moment he was there, and the next it had consumed him whole; he was gone.

""Dammit!"" I shouted and dropped the supplies from the vending machine. I ran immediately to the stairs that led to the motel rooms to meet back up with Lily. As I reached the bottom of the stairs, I stepped into a dark spot in the room. It was 2 am, so it didn't look out of place, but as I stepped into it, I realised my mistake. A black arm made of fire shot out and gripped me by the throat and pulled me into the darkness, and everything went numb.

I was falling in the darkness, although it wasn't dark; I could make out each black ember around me in crisp detail, and I felt like I was experiencing everything through a state of tunnel vision and extreme focus.

I felt confused and foggy about what was happening, and I remember an extreme feeling of calm whilst I fell in this world of fire.

Suddenly my calm was disturbed by a flickering of light. I looked towards it, and it seemed to peel back the fire around it. I could see the silhouette of someone in that light, but I couldn't recognise who.

""Elijah…"" the voice cried out.

""Elijah, please…"" it continued.

It took me a second to realise that it was talking about me. ,

""Elijah, come to me please, for God's sake,"" the voice cried out once more.

I trusted the voice, and although I was falling, I felt the strength to move. I tried to swim in this abyss, and to my shock, I was able to move closer to the light.

""Yes, Elijah, keep coming,"" the voice shouted before crying out in pain. Suddenly the fire violently swarmed around the light, and I felt a resounding amount of hate from all around me. The silhouette dropped to her knees, and I continued to push myself forward even though it had become much harder.

I ordered a smoked salmon sandwich and a matcha latte. The matcha latte was really good — tasted authentic and just the right amount of creaminess. The salmon sandwich, though, was a bit too salty for me. I struggled to finish it, but I still did. 😂

The place itself can be quiet, depending on who you’re seated near. When I first came in, someone was having a loud phone call, but once she left, it was peaceful again.
