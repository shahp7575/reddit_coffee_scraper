We all know the struggle: you pick a popular spot, it's deafeningly loud, and you spend the whole date shouting ""WHAT?"" across the table.

I'm starting a master list of places that are low-pressure, conducive to conversation, and pass the vibe check.

**My Top Picks to Start:**

* **Manhattan (East Village):** Amor y Amargo. It's tiny, intimate, and focuses on bitters. No juice, just serious cocktails. Perfect if you want to look like you know your stuff but keep it low-key.
* **Brooklyn (Williamsburg):** Hotel Delmano. It's got that speakeasy vibe without being impossible to get into. Great for a second or third date when you want to escalate the romance a bit.
* **The ""Sober/Activity"" Date:** Walking the High Line (if it's nice out) and grabbing coffee at Blue Bottle, or checking out The Met to avoid the awkward ""interview"" vibe of a dinner date.
* **The ""Easy Exit"" Spot:** Amelie in the West Village for wine bar vibes. Reasonably priced (nobody's trying to spend $80 on a first date 10 minutes in) and easy to bail if it's not going well lol.

**What are your go-to spots?**

Looking for recommendations in:

* **Astoria/LIC:** (Heard good things about Dutch Kills?)
* **UES:** (Is there anything cool up there besides Penrose?)

ich hab folgendes Problem: 
Meine Kaffeemaschine baut nicht richtig Druck auf. Bei der Extraktion fließt der Kaffee sehr langsam als dem Siebträger raus und braucht dementsprechend suuuper lange. Das Symbol ist aufgepoppt aber der Tank ist voll. Auch die Dampflanze hat Probleme. Genau so wie die brühgruppe baut dies auch nicht nicht mehr so viel Druck und Luft auf wie früher. 

Es handelt sich um die HIBREW H13. Ich hab es Brand neu vor 2 Monate gekauft. 
Ich brauche dringend Hilfe🥲🥲🥲 
Ich vermisse meinen Kaffee. 

Wenn ihr vielleicht eine Lösung oder sogar vielleicht die Ursache wisst, schreibt gerne🥹 

Danke im Voraus!

While we lived in the same city, we saw each other almost every day for coffee or we helped each other with everyday things (we went shopping together, helped each other with cleaning...), when she moved to another city, we started hearing each other every day via voice messages and reporting to each other about all kinds of stupid things that happen to us on a daily basis. Now we hear each other very rarely, and even when we do see each other I have the impression that we have nothing to talk about. I feel lonely and it frustrates me a lot (the feeling is very unpleasant and strange), I have never felt lonely in my life. It seems to me that I need to expand my circle of friends. Does anyone have any suggestions or books that can help me with this?

I'm curious about how many friends INTJs have in general, and what all the criteria a person needs to meet in order for you to classify them as friends rather than colleagues or acquaintances...",1,1766959813.0,intj,0,1.0,False
1py41ca,https://www.reddit.com/r/MM_RomanceBooks/comments/1py41ca/empty_throne_trilogy_by_kai_butler/,Empty Throne trilogy by Kai Butler,"I really enjoyed this author’s Emperor’s Assassin series, more for the world building than the romance itself. I thought the plot was really interesting, even if I felt like the MC should be a bit smarter, I liked his character development as the books went on. 

Anyway, since I really enjoyed that series and I’m caught up with it, I thought I’d give their other books a try. 

I just started Exiled Heir, the first in her empty throne trilogy, and I’m wondering if this is gonna be for me. I don’t like when people who are supposed to have these grand supernatural powers get easily taken down with a simple drug, or make dumbass mistakes like >!stopping at a bar when you’re on the run from a crazy killer. Like you’re a supernatural being! You should need magical alcohol to even get drunk. And if you know the dude that’s chasing you can kill you before his morning coffee (literally how it’s described) why are you stopping anywhere before at least getting very, very far away?? !< It wouldn’t bother me so much if the character wasn’t hyped as a super duper special powerful shifter. 

Anyway, I want to know if this type of stupidity continues from anyone that has read this book, bc if so, then it’s better that I move on from this one. The reviews I’ve read don’t mention this aspect and lean favorable towards the MC so it’s making me feel conflicted. ",3,1766959712.0,MM_RomanceBooks,0,1.0,False

1py411i,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1py411i/the_fellow_opus_a_dire_warning/,The Fellow Opus: A Dire Warning,"I'll pop the TL;DR right up here because my fuller telling is rife with detail borne of fresh rage: My new Fellow Opus arrived in such a state that it does not grind coffee beans (cause mysterious), and customer support has been an active hindrance. My curses to Fellow and direst warnings to prospective customers. Now, the story:

I got my first espresso machine for Christmas, and was excited to begin brewing, but knew I needed some extra equipment to make the process worthwhile. I swapped the machine's pressurized portafilter for a standard bottomless one, ordered some simple puck prep miscellanea, and, of course, purchased a grinder. My machine is fairly cheap, and I figured I'd go the same route with the grinder, but still wanted an actually espresso-capable one that produces an actually espresso-worthy grind. With one Mr. Hoffman's input and some other research, I narrowed the field down to a few viable candidates in my price range, and went with the Fellow Opus on account of it having the fastest delivery time (I was eager to get started) and being tied for lowest price among my choices. Today, all of my equipment had arrived, and so had I, back home with some freshly roasted beans that I was excited to grind and then transform into a sumptuous espresso beverage for the first time in my young life.

  
So, I popped a cup onto my scale, zeroed it, and poured in two more grams of beans than I hoped to get back out, having read that this was a grinder with a decent bit of retention (but also having made my peace with it). I hit the beans with a light spritz of water and tossed them round in the cup, acting for nobody as though I was versed in the craft, and then eagerly poured them into the machine's mechanical maw. Catch cup in place, I hit the sole button on the grinder, initiating a 30 second cycle. On it went. Never having used the machine before, I was not acquainted with the difference between the sound it makes when it is grinding beans and when it is not. Nor shall I ever be. When the cycle finished, I was surprised to see plenty of whole beans still clearly visible in the chamber up top. I checked the catch cup. The grounds looked rather scarce, but who was I to say what 18 grams of espresso grounds look like in a cup I had never used before? Thankfully, anticipating useful information on retention, I had zeroed my scale to the catch cup before grinding. Onto the scale it went. 4 grams. Uh oh.

  
Perhaps this was an unlucky break, I thought, and the grinder had some first-time jitters that would all be sorted out if I simply ran another cycle. So I emptied what few grounds had reached the catch cup into my portafilter, put the cup back in place, and pressed the button once more. This time, one gram.

  
Okay, a full-on jam on first use is unlucky, and probably a sign of bigger problems. But I had spent my $200 and I had spent it this way. And this was to be my first proper grind and espresso brew ever! So I was determined to troubleshoot instead of reaching immediately for a return. I consulted the instruction booklet and followed first its prescription for a minor jam: a couple whacks and a jostle. Having expelled a poof of grounds and a chunk or two, I was satisfied that it would work like new (it is, after all, new). Plenty of beans still in the chamber, I hit the button again. 30 seconds passed. Only one additional gram came out of the grinder.

  
Now, I moved to the section of the manual on major jams. I got all the beans out, disassembled and cleaned the burr, then reinstalled it. Surely, a fresh burr and load of beans would set this thing straight (I admit, at this point, I was actually almost out of hope). So in I poured the beans and on I pressed the button. Two grams.

  
I have spent the past nearly three hours in contact with support. After satisfying myself that this merchant of luxury finished goods does not present a single phone number I can call, I humbly submitted my Sunday to support chatbot hell. After some prompting, it connected me with an alleged human, who apparently also does not have a phone line or a manager with a phone line--the entire company seems never to have heard of such wondrous technology. After I recapitulated the precise nature of my problem and the steps I had so far taken to the supposed customer support officer with much greater concision than here, she sent me an email that she promised contained steps to solve it. I was pretty skeptical of her humanity from the diction of her messages, and so I expected to frustratingly receive a basic rundown of the steps I had already tried. 



It was so much worse than that. In response to my clear complaint that my coffee grinder flat-out does not grind coffee, ""her"" email contained a few suggested prophylactics against basic retention issues. When I tabbed back to the chat room and expressed, this time without a facade of placidity and politeness, that her email was entirely unrelated to the problem I had just explained, she assured me that with a reply to her prior email containing such a video, we'd definitely solve the problem. ""Alright, \[alleged name\], I'll do that. I, too, have unwavering faith that my problem will be solved,"" I typed, with no subtlety, and pressed send. Nothing happened. Pressed send again. No dice. Pressed send again. You get the point. The chat window, much like the coffee grinder into which I had invested two hundred dollars and innumerable hopes, had ceased to function. Unlike the very expensive brick on my counter, it at least did its job for a short time beforehand.

  
Anyway, I sent that email with a video getting every nook and cranny of the inside of that machine, and shots of its exterior, but I am absolutely certain that the company will not be able to solve my problem from that video. Anyhow, I sent the email over two hours ago, and have not heard so much as a confirmation of receipt in reply, much less the promised fix. It sure would be nice to know that an actual human somewhere on this planet is aware of my issue. Maybe that's why I'm writing all this. Maybe I hope someone at Fellow sees it. I don't know. I certainly hope that by posting this tirade, I can prevent at least one other eager beaver from wasting two hundred dollars, a perfectly good weekend, a few (and likely more) episodes of inconsolable rage, and a disastrous first-ever brew attempt. 

  
Needless to say, I will be buying a different grinder. But that is not the end of this saga. I will have contact with a fellow at Fellow, come hell or high water, and I will exact more in recompense than I paid for that god-forsaken ""grinder."" Three days after getting my first espresso machine, I still have never brewed espresso. Now, it will be at least another week before I ever do. May all, but especially they, hear: this company owes me.",1,1766959692.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1py3z16,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1py3z16/is_it_normal_for_your_spouse_not_to_offer_small/,"Is it normal for your spouse not to offer small gestures, or is this a red flag?","Tl;dr: Recently married. Husband didn’t offer to drive me or order me an Uber when my dinner plans changed. He says I’m being unreasonable and that the cost/time wasn’t worth it. I feel hurt because I wanted the gesture, not the ride. Am I overreacting, or is this about a bigger pattern of conditional effort?

I need some objective, impartial opinions because I genuinely don’t know if I’m overreacting here. I’m open to being critiqued if it helps me work on myself and improve my relationship.

I got married a few months ago. For context, my husband is a great guy. We were together on and off for 4 years before getting married, and I know he loves me. But sometimes his love feels very conditional — like he shows it when it suits him, and when I call that out, it turns into an argument.
Here’s the situation that’s bothering me:
A few days ago, I was going out for dinner with my girlfriends. The restaurant changed last minute to somewhere in a different area, which frustrated me because my husband and I had already planned that he’d drop me off at the original place. He was a bit apprehensive about the drive, but his brother lives near there, so we agreed he could hang out with him after.
When I mentioned the new restaurant (about an hour or two before I had to leave), what I hoped to hear was something like:
“I’ll take you,” or at least, “I’ll get you an Uber.”
It’s about a 25-minute drive.

What I got instead was silence and a kind of, “That’s annoying.”

I went to the bedroom to get ready and asked him to bring me a coffee. When he came in, I had the Uber app open checking prices. He said, “Let me check on my phone,” but then said his iOS was too old and it wasn’t working. No problem — I told him I could just book it myself on another cheaper app I found.
He left the room. He now says he went to check Uber on his browser, which he might have, but in the full hour I was getting ready, he never came back to ask what I’d decided or if I needed help. Only when I was at the front door putting my shoes on and said, “The Uber’s outside,” did he realise I’d sorted it.
The next day, I brought it up. I wasn’t mad about the ride itself — I was hurt that he didn’t even offer. We ended up fighting. He said it would’ve been an hour round trip for him and the petrol would’ve cost the same as the Uber anyway. Logically, he’s not wrong.

But… he’s my husband. Shouldn’t he want to do that? Or at least offer?

He didn’t drive me. He didn’t order the Uber. He didn’t pick me up later either.
He says I’m being unreasonable.

To add to why I might’ve been extra emotional: earlier that day, his brother came over and between the two of them they finished all the Christmas dinner leftovers I’d made. I was left with some Brussels sprouts, parsnips, carrots, and literally a crumb of the cheesecake I made — on a big plate. I’m not exaggerating when I say crumb.

So by the time the Uber thing happened, I think I’d already started spiralling.
When we argued, he said, “If we asked anyone about this, they’d all agree with me.”

It’s not a competition, but I guess I’m taking him up on that and asking here.

He is a great guy. I love him. But I’ve seen this side of him before when we were dating, and I always told him how it made me feel. Maybe I got swept up in everything with the wedding and now I’m trying to stay calm and level-headed while also not ignoring my gut.

I’m not sure how to feel, what to say, or how to move forward from this.

So please — honest responses. Am I losing my mind here? 😅

I usually get him much smaller things that I think would make him happy. He loves gadgets for example, so I try to find things in that category that are useful and cool. But they end up collecting dust. I've even gotten him gift cards to get new shoes or glasses, and it takes him like two years to actually use it. It's gotten to the point where I dread christmas and his birthday because of the labor involved in finding him something he might like. Like, I have to sit there for days, researching and thinking of gift ideas, only for him to be lukewarm about them. I mean, he appreciates the gift in the moment (who doesn't love to open presents on their birthday or chritmas?), but those gifts end up put into a drawer and forgotten about.

1py3x49,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1py3x49/someone_turned_my_campsite_into_a_trap_while_i/,Someone Turned My Campsite Into a Trap While I Slept,"I am writing this from a hospital waiting room with my hands wrapped like I tried to catch barbed wire on instinct.

I went camping last weekend at a state park outside my town. That is what the reservation email said. Loop C.

I still have the receipt. It is smeared from rain and sweat, but I can read enough of it. State park. Camping fee, one night. Vehicle fee. Total thirty-five dollars. A reservation ID that means nothing to anyone except me.

I am not asking you to believe in the paranormal. Something mechanical happened to me out there. Something you can buy, carry in a tote, and switch on.

I camp alone a lot. I do it the boring way. I tell my sister where I am. I park nose-out. I lock food up. I do not hike off trail at night. I do not drink. I do not go looking for trouble.

This time I wanted one quiet night and a morning coffee that tastes like smoke.

I got there around 4:40 p.m. The ranger in the booth tore my printed slip and gave me the usual talk about quiet hours and not leaving coolers unattended. The entrance sign had a changeable-letter board under it. Fire danger was moderate. No moving firewood. Quiet hours 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.

The park was half full. Families in big SUVs. A couple with a rooftop tent. A group of teenagers arguing over a Bluetooth speaker that kept cutting out when they walked too far from it.

Loop C sat deeper in the pines. The road was dirt and washboarded. My spot was on the outer edge. Not the best view, but private. Picnic table. Fire ring. One of those steel bear boxes bolted into a slab of concrete, the kind that squeals when you open it.

The first thing that felt off was the posts.

There were four skinny fiberglass stakes around my site, about waist height, with bright orange reflective tape on the tops. Like survey markers. They were spaced in a loose square that did not match a normal campsite boundary. Each stake had a black zip tie near the top, cinched tight around nothing.

I stood there longer than I want to admit, staring at them with my hands on my hips like that would solve anything. I told myself it was maintenance. Hazard tree marking. Utility work. Something.

I set up my tent, a little two-person backpacking tent. I parked nose-out. I put my cooler in the bear box.

Here is the stupid human mistake I keep replaying. I did not latch the bear box the first time.

I closed it. I heard the heavy door thunk. I walked away thinking it was secure. Ten minutes later I walked back and realized the latch was still open by half an inch, the way it sits when you do not pull it down and lock it. I muttered at myself, fixed it, and moved on.

Around 6:10 I walked to the restroom building to wash up. The building was painted that tired park-bathroom green, and it smelled like damp concrete and lemon cleaner that never quite wins. On the way back I passed a bigger site where a dad was pounding stakes into the ground with the flat side of a hatchet.

He nodded at me and said the bugs were insane.

I agreed even though I hadn’t noticed bugs yet.

He looked past me toward my site and squinted like he was trying to read something in the dark.

“What are those poles?” he asked.

“Already here,” I said. “Probably maintenance.”

He made a face like he did not love that answer, then went back to his tent.

I made a small fire. Not a big one. Just enough to feel like I earned being outside. I ate a pouch dinner and sat on the bench with my headlamp around my neck, listening to the campground noise thin out. A baby cried somewhere down the loop. Someone laughed too loud and got shushed. A car door slammed. Then it got quiet in that way campgrounds do, where you still hear people, but it comes in little distant pieces.

At 9:58 my phone flipped from 5G to SOS. I remember because I looked at it before crawling into my sleeping bag. I texted my sister “All good. Night.” It failed to send. Not surprising. Lots of parks have dead spots.

I fell asleep with my keys in my hand.

That is another thing I normally never do. I always put them in the same pocket. This time I was half asleep and I set them on the picnic table when I tightened my tent guylines, then forgot to pick them back up. I did not realize that until later, when it mattered.

I slept for maybe two hours.

I woke up because my tent moved.

Not a gentle flutter of wind. A hard tug, like someone grabbed the rainfly and yanked.

My first thought was an animal brushing past. Then the tent moved again, lower, like pressure at ankle height.

I sat up fast. My elbow hit the tent wall. My heart went straight to my throat.

I listened.

No footsteps. No snorting. Just a faint sound outside that didn’t belong. A tiny clicking, steady, like a cheap plastic pen being pressed over and over.

Click. Click. Click.

I found my headlamp and turned it on, pointing it at the tent wall. The nylon glowed. Shadows moved wrong. Thin lines crossed the fabric, not like branches, not like the normal wavering shapes you see when a light hits canvas.

I pushed the door zipper open just enough to look out.

The beam hit the orange tape on the nearest stake and flashed bright. Behind it, in the dark, something caught the light in sharp little glints.

Clear line. Fishing line. Monofilament. Dozens of strands stretched between the stakes. Some at shin height, some at waist height, some higher. A web that had not been there when I went to sleep.

And it was moving.

Not swaying. Pulling. Tightening.

The clicking got faster.

A line snapped tight across the front of my tent door and the nylon creased around it like it was being cinched. The tent shifted an inch. Then another.

I crawled out on my hands and knees because standing felt like begging to get clotheslined. The headlamp made the lines sparkle for half a second, then they vanished again unless the beam hit them at the right angle.

A line caught my wrist.

It did not wrap gently. It bit. Pain so clean it felt hot. It dug into skin like a wire saw.

I yanked back on instinct and the line tightened, dragging my hand forward toward the nearest stake. My headlamp bounced. The beam flashed over the ground and I saw where the lines were anchored.

Small black boxes at the base of trees, each about the size of a brick. Each had a spool and a little metal wheel like a tiny winch. The clicking was coming from those boxes.

They were pulling the line in.

A second line snapped up and caught two of my fingers together. My hand cramped instantly. I felt my pulse banging against plastic and pressure.

I went for my pocket knife. Got it open. Brought it down on the line at my wrist.

It did not cut right away. The line stretched. The blade skated. Then it finally nicked through. The moment it broke, the free end snapped back and whipped my knuckles.

I rolled, trying to get clear. A line tightened under my armpit. Another caught my ankle and my foot slid toward the stake like the ground had turned slick.

I started yelling. Loud. Ugly. I screamed for help until my throat burned.

No one came running.

Either nobody heard, or nobody wanted to charge into a campsite full of invisible line.

Then I heard something new. Not clicking.

A soft electronic chirp, like a key fob, followed by a longer tone.

One of the winch boxes changed pitch. It went from click to a smooth high whine for half a second.

The line on my wrist tightened again and I understood what it was doing.

This wasn’t just a web. It was a net that was closing around me.

I crawled toward the nearest box, cutting lines as I went. Each cut line snapped back, stinging, sometimes catching my clothes. The knife handle got slick with blood. My wrist burned in a clean groove where the line had opened it.

I reached the nearest box.

It was strapped to the trunk with a ratchet strap. A thick battery pack sat beside it, wired in. On top was a small antenna, like a cheap handheld radio.

The line ran through a metal guide and onto a spool.

I drove the knife down and cut as close to the spool as I could.

The motor protested. The line went slack for a breath.

Then the spool reversed and yanked the slack back. The line tightened around my calf again, harder, like the system corrected itself.

Something in the trees flashed to my left.

A red dot, low, moving.

My headlamp caught a shape behind a trunk. Someone using the trees. Keeping distance. A hand raised. I saw the rectangle of a phone or a remote. The red dot moved again and settled on my torso, steady, like it was aimed on purpose.

My stomach turned cold. Not because of the dot. Because of what it meant.

This was for me.

I grabbed the battery cable and ripped it out of the box.

The clicking stopped. The line around my leg went slack so suddenly I almost fell backward.

For half a second it was quiet except for my breathing and the soft snap of the fire dying down in the ring.

Then another clicking started farther away. Another box. Backup. The lines began tightening again, slower but still tightening.

The person in the trees shifted. Leaves crushed under a careful step.

I did not wait.

I crawled out of the tightening net, cutting and dragging, getting snagged, freeing myself in inches. My shorts tore. My skin caught line and I felt it burn new grooves across my thigh and forearm. My headlamp bounced, turning the trees into quick flashes.

I got to my car and reached for my keys.

Nothing.

My pocket was empty.

My brain did this blank, stupid pause, like it tried to deny reality for a second. Then it hit me. Picnic table.

The clicking sped up again. The net tightened again. I could feel it starting to catch my waist.

I turned my headlamp toward the picnic table and saw them glinting there like a cruel joke. Right where I left them.

I crawled to the table, grabbed them, and my wrist screamed when the line shifted against the cut.

I got back to the car, hit unlock, and yanked the door open.

A line snapped tight across my waist as I tried to get in. It caught on my belt and pulled me back hard enough that my head clipped the door frame.

I screamed and cut at it. The knife finally sliced through. The tension snapped back into the trees.

I fell into the seat, slammed the door, and locked it.

Lines slapped the outside of the car. I heard them ping against the metal like cables flicking a drum. In my headlight beam I saw the stakes again, and my stomach dropped even more.

There were more than four.

Extra stakes beyond the campsite boundary, closer to the road, hidden in brush. The web reached toward the road like it expected me to run.

I started the car and threw it into reverse.

The tires spun on dirt. The car lurched and I felt a jolt, like I hit something soft but strong. The hood dipped. The lines stretched. For a second I thought the car would be held in place.

Then the lines snapped.

The sound was sharp, multiplied. Whip cracks. The hood shook. Something slapped the windshield and left a wet streak.

I reversed hard, then swung forward, aiming for the main road out of the loop.

In my mirror, between trunks, I saw the person move.

A silhouette, closer now. Reflective tape on their sleeves, orange like the stakes. They stepped toward my car and raised a hand.

Not waving. Pointing.

My headlights swept the ground and for a second I saw what they’d been standing near. A plastic tote half buried in needles, lid cracked open, full of coiled clear line and more black boxes. Supplies.

I hit the gas.

On the way out I laid on the horn until it sounded wrong. I wanted lights to come on. I wanted witnesses.

Some did. Porch lights snapped on. A man stepped onto the road in socks, hands up like he did not know whether to stop me or ask what was wrong.

I did not stop.

I drove straight to the entrance booth. It was closed, dark, but there was an emergency phone box by the gate. A small sign above it said to lift the receiver for emergencies and not to use it for reservations.

My hands shook so badly I dropped the receiver once. I told the dispatcher someone had set wire traps in my campsite and there were motors pulling them tight. I kept saying “wire” because “fishing line” sounded too stupid for what it had done.

A sheriff’s deputy arrived first. Then a ranger in a separate vehicle. They took one look at my wrists and legs and told me to sit.

They drove back to Loop C with lights on.

I didn’t go with them. I couldn’t make myself.

I sat under a buzzing light and watched moths slam into the plastic cover while my blood dripped onto the concrete. I remember thinking, very clearly, that the drip was too slow to be real, like my brain was watching it in someone else’s body.

When the ranger came back his face looked different, like he’d aged ten years on the drive.

He did not tell me it was nothing. He did not tell me I imagined it.

He said, “We found it.”

They found the stakes. They found the lines. They found multiple winch boxes still strapped to trees, still working, still pulling line even after I’d ripped one battery loose. They found the tote.

They did not find the person.

At the hospital they irrigated the cuts. They picked clear fragments out of my skin with tweezers. They gave me a tetanus shot. The doctor asked if I’d been attacked.

I told him yes.

He asked by what.

I told him, “A system.”

Two days later I drove past that state park on my way to work just to prove to myself it existed.

The sign is still there. The entrance still looks friendly. The little tourist board still advertises it like a peaceful place to unwind.

Loop C is closed now. There is new signage zip-tied to the permanent posts. Bright yellow, temporary. It says the area is closed due to utility work and not to enter Loop C.

If I ever camp again and see skinny fiberglass stakes with reflective tape that do not make sense, or zip ties around nothing, I won’t assume it is maintenance.

I won’t sleep in that site.

I won’t step between those posts.

And if I hear clicking in the dark that doesn’t sound like an animal, I’m leaving. I’m doing it before the lines start moving.

Because once they start pulling, you stop being a camper.

1py3wvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1py3wvb/rancilio_silvia_with_gagiamate_or_lelit_elizabeth/,Rancilio Silvia with Gagiamate or Lelit Elizabeth [$1200],"My journey into finding my first home espresso machine has been a rollercoaster. I started with a 700€ budget, spiked to over 4,000€, and have now landed back in the ""entry-level prosumer"" range. It’s just hard for me to justify the cost of a high-end setup for a 3-4 coffees per day

​I’m currently torn between two paths:

-​Rancilio Silvia (Single Boiler) + Gaggiamate mod: This would cost around 900–1000€. As a bit of a nerd, I’m drawn to the configurability—flow profiling, temp control, and brew-by-weight sound amazing. Plus, the Silvia’s build quality feels superior to me. And I am not afraid about the installation process of the Gagiamate 

-​Lelit Elizabeth (Dual Boiler): For a bit more money (1200€), I get a proper dual boiler with integrated PID.
​Here’s my dilemma: I mostly drink lattes, so a dual boiler is the logical choice. However, I’ve realized at work (where we have a high-end dual boiler machine) that I never actually brew and steam at the same time anyway—I'm terrible at multitasking!

​Does it make sense to get the Silvia for the ""tinkering"" potential, or should I just go for the Elizabeth for the integrated features and convenience?

1py3vez,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/1py3vez/i_dont_regret_cheating_on_my_boyfriend/,I dont regret cheating on my boyfriend,"When I was 17 my parents were always strict ,not the insane kind, but the military kind. Both of them, my father is a retired helicopter pilot and my mom was an officer. I was a troubling child, backtalk, additude overdramatic, all that stuff in a normal teenager I guess. We were in America at the time in a small town cause my dad was over in Germany and we were waiting to move there. 6 months waiting. I met Charles at a local pizza joint that I love and we hit it off, but I had an off feeling, this jitter, a stomach feeling, whatever you wanna call it when I was with Charles. 

I've read enough romance books to smell when something was wrong, but this is a first time ive seen a boy be so nervous and smile so sweetly when I talk, so I played dumb. He asked out on the 2 month and I said yes. I wish I knew how much I'd regret that. After we started dating, or if you wanna call it that, Charles was always needy. Im not talking in a cute teenage way, I mean texting when I was doing my school, my volunteer hours, bedtime, the hours he knew I wouldnt be able to answer most of the time.

 I'd put my phone on silent once and Charles actually rode his bike to the gas station I was sitting out at to check if I was alive or something. So like any sane person would do, I tried to talk to him and he immeditaly backtracked saying he was 'worried' for my safety. I thought it was bull crap but I was boycrazy or whatever so I believed him and thought i was paranoid and this is what boyfriends do.

Fast forward 2 more months and it gets worse, he becomes possessive and werid, he'd text me things like 'can't belibe you belong to me' and 'I love im the only person you are happy with'. It made me uncomfortable. Until spring break rolled around and he had to go to a beach trip with his parents. I was relieved and he didnt text me all week, it was refreshing but I should've seen the signs. If my everso clingy and possessive boyfriend goes off the radar. 

When he comes back he says he had a great time, he starts to text me like a normal boyfriend would. Regular times, random texts at random times.

Its was a rainy day on a Sunday when he sent the text ""Hey Meredith, you doing good?"" With three wink emoji. First im not Meredith, my name has is 5 words. I watch him immiedtaly deleted the message and apologize for doing that and said he had the 'wrong number'. im not stupid,​ I go offline. 

The next time he comes over we watched movie and we didnt bring up the Meredith thighs which seemed to relax him. Hes checks my phone the whole time to see if im cheating, its normal whenever he comes over for him to snoop through my stuff to see if im a 'loyal' girlfriend. He makes these little manipulative comments about us trying to make think hes the best boyfriend and how I need this, i nod along but inside I was go upstairs and sleep.

When he goes to the bathroom, I lung at his phone and unlock it, searching meredith the call and right there. With two hearts on each side of the name is her name. I scan through they're texts and my heart sinks

This was an emotional affair. Long texts about theyre nights together, they planning on losing on going all the way soon. All behind my back, I didnt cry, I didnt shout. I exited out and put the phone down.

He came back obvious knowing I knew his dirty secret. When he left, I cried in my room for an hour, realizing what I fool I was because this little possessive prick tricked me into loving him when he was having an affair with some girl he probably met at the beach.

I didnt react I kept playing the controlled girlfriend while I collected data about her. I made him come over more, I made Charles drink a lot of water and when long bathroom breaks. I snatched his phone and screenshot everything and sent them to my email. 

​then I had a guy react out to me, his name was Jay. He explained that Meredith might be having an affair with my boyfriend and he wanted me to know, I was surprised this giy even got my number because I have zero social media whatsoever. 

We talked and he turned out to be Meredith boyfriend, they were both cheaters, we shared data and collected information, when I knew Charles wasnt busy, when I knew. I disabled the tracking device on my phone I met Jay for coffee, unlike Charles when I met him, Jay had this warmth ive never felt. This bubbley warmth like eating a soft brownie. It was werid feeling this for my boyfriend affairs boyfriend. 

Jay explained Meredith and him went to a beach with theyre families and that's where they met Charles, Jay suspected Charles liked Meredith but he didnt wanna be the suspicious controlling boyfriend so he pushed it aside. And one and two times happened he found out when Charles was calling Meredith while she was in the shower and he had my boyfriend listed at 'charlie'

I continued to meet up with Jay, while my boyfriend thought i was at my job. 2 weeks passed and things moved fast, Jay got touchy when we met up, hand on shoulder, or knee to knee. We had to instant spark. We didnt care if we were cheating also they started it first. And then while Jay was driving me home. We saw Charles chair parked outside my driveway and him waiting at the door. 

I didnt even move, i turned to Jay and kissed him for Charles to see, he didnt even mind. While Charles roared angrily at me. I got out and Charles grabbed me ""WHAT THE F\*UCK WAS THAT? YOU CHEATER! AFTER EVERYTHING I DID FOR YOU!?"" He acreamed in my face, i shoved him hard, stared at him on the ground and smiled I walked past Charles back to Jay car and said ""we're over​, hope you have fun with meredith,""

1py3t03,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1py3t03/tifu_by_asking_my_ex_to_get_back_together_with_me/,TIFU by asking my ex to get back together with me on a goodreads review,"Probably just did the most embarassing thing of my life. Soooo me and my ex broke up on somewhat mutual terms about 2 months ago, and we were mostly no contact since then until for christmas she reached out to me and asked me if I'd like to get coffee with her as friends. I agreed because honestly at the time I had more or less forgotten about her and thought it'd be interesting to see if we could click it as friends

Long story short, it was not a good idea. The conversation was more or less normal and we discussed shared goals and ambitions for the new year, but I could feel feelings coming back as we were talking. Right at the end of the hangout we discussed our dating lives, and we both agreed that that just felt wrong, and maybe hanging out as friends wasn't a good idea, but we agreed to still talk about shared interests like books over text. 

Right after I started getting this really weird attachment limerance feeling towards her, as though I was breaking up with her all over again. I literally went 48 hours non stop thinking about her and although I didn't want to tell her that, I couldn't help wondering if she felt the same. So there was this book that we were both coreading together when we were still together and she was still right at the beginning and I had just finished. I had mentioned that I was going to write a review and she said, definitely do but make sure to add a spoiler warning because I don't want to read it until I'm finished. 

While writing this review I was still dealing with the aforementioned limerance so I added just randomly at the end the sentance ""\_\_\_ I still love you please take me back"" and some other random bs ab how I was feeling at the time. Cannot stress enough, it was 1 sentance in a really really long review, that was covered by a spoiler header. I decided to keep it in for myself, because it was like talking to her without her actually knowing, and I uploaded it. 

Anyways this limerance wasn't going away so I decided to outright ask her today if she wanted to see me again, and add that I still had feelings for her after she responded based on her response. Unfortunately she responded with ""I think its best we keep no contact, I saw the review and it made me very uncomfortable"". I cannot stress enough that I didn't want her to look at it and I want to shoot myself so so much. I responded with I understand and a short reason as to why I put that in the review and how i didnt mean for her to see it. and I said yeah lets do no contact. She also blocked me on goodreads, but not on any other social media for some reason.

 I don't want to ever even see her again, but how does my ego even come back from this? I genuinely want to move countries because of this. 

  
TL;DR:  Reconnected with ex, and caught feelings again, decided to put them in a goodreads review that she said she would't read. Decided to eventually try to confess them but she said she already read the review and it made her really uncomfortable. Then she blocked me on goodreads. and I want to die.

Apparently, I offended a young guy by not holding the door open for him. I had slipped inside quickly—'vancouver style'—because I was freezing. He wasn't even right behind me; he was a good couple of paces away and walking slowly. Despite that, he came in extremely offended and got right in my face, shouting about what a 'rude bitch' I was loud enough for everyone to know what’s happening. 

I didn't do it on purpose, but this type of reaction  doesn't make me regret it.

Thankfully, an older gentleman stepped in and asked him to calm down. The young guy just kept hurling nonsensical insults, but he eventually dialed it back because someone intervened (people started watching..).

I don’t understand why he was so worked up. No one is  obligated to hold a door, especially when the other person isn't close by. 

Again, I really wanted to thank the man in line for speaking up and grabbing us coffee (you didn’t need to do that). I believe the other guy would have kept going until I left the Tim Hortons if someone else hadn't said anything.

Me (32,M) and Sherri (31,F) had been married for 7 years. She decided she didn’t want to be married anymore. She retained an attorney and had divorce papers drawn up. Surprised me with them on Christmas Eve. She made it ugly. I had gotten her a job at my company and she made the whole thing a spectacle, screaming at me in my office. I had to call Security more than once. I pulled some favors and she was transferred to another location across town. The divorce was granted. Found out laterfrom reliable sources that she had been cheating for over a year but never made an issue out of it as the divorce was already finalized by that time and I was moving on. 

Fast forward about a year. We had talked very infrequently but managed to keep it civil. I had some papers that needed to be signed, nothing new and all part of the settlement. So I drove to her office and she signed without hesitation. We were talking for a few minutes when one of her co-workers walked in. “Oh, I didn’t know you were busy.” I just said “I’m from IT just here to fix a quick problem” not wanting to make anything complicated.  The girl left. “That’s Cassie. She’s 23 and she’s trouble” my ex said. “Makes lot of bad choices.”  I just smiled and said “That’s my favorite kind right now.” Signed papers in hand I thanked her and headed out. Cassie stopped me in the hall and we chatted for a few minutes.

As I entered the parking garage headed for my car, my ex called to me from behind. “I saw you talking to her and I’m trying to warn you. And she’s too young for you also!”  I asked “Why would this be of any concern to you? We’re both free agents now.” She said “I just don’t want you to get hurt.”  “That’s really odd coming from you of all people. But my life is my own. Thank you again for signing and have a great day.”  I drove away.

This next part was told to me.  About two weeks later, on a Monday morning, Sherri and Cassie bumped into each other at morning coffee. Sherri asked about the weekend and Cassie said “Oh, I had dinner with \[my name\]. He invited me over and grilled steaks, then we watched a movie. He has a really nice house! And why didn’t you tell me that he’s your ex-husband?” 

My phone rang from a company number and Sherri was on the other end. “You can’t date my co-workers!” she screamed. “Well, actually yes I can.” I replied. “Don’t worry it’s nothing serious. Just friends getting to know each other, that’s all. And thanks to you for making it possible!” She slammed the phone down.

Cassie and are not really dating. Just friends with sometimes benefits. Sometimes she comes over to hang out, sometimes she stays, sometimes she doesn’t. Sometimes it’s just burgers and wine. No commitment. I hear that my ex has applied for several jobs elsewhere in the company and a transfer.

So, AITA?

**Chapter 1 – Amelia**

 

*One year later.*

 \----

When the western hemisphere catastrophically collapsed, catching on fire in the process, it cast many ripples across the ocean. A family of three huddled in a shipping container on a boat, the *Queen of War,* riding the very last such ripple before the ocean, and the continent, went still as death. The sky they sailed under was broken; the family, a daughter, son, and father, doubly so. The daughter and father had broken memories, the father and son had broken hearts. Because the father was the reason for the son’s broken heart, the son disavowed him. However, he agreed to uphold their rough semblance of a family unit for the sake of surviving the journey.

Amelia Freed learned this all from the cargo ship’s captain. The captain, the second since the impossible journey began, should be commended for taking the time to speak to each of his passengers. However, Amelia was all but certain he hadn’t. He’d stolen these stories from their heads. Dire consequences awaited the captain, but first, she needed him to help her find one of the missing passengers, the father of the family of three.

“Did you help him escape? Our fugitive?” she asked bluntly.

“What? N-no. I never spoke to him.” The captain raised his dried and cracked hands as if to ward off a blow. His lips, dehydrated and matted with his own sea-sprayed hair, quivered. He was in his mid-twenties, a child to Amelia, but the fire, salt, and hunger of the journey had piled several more years upon his hunched shoulders. Just how many was up to Amelia’s experienced hands to tally.

She nodded, almost certain the missing man had simply leapt overboard. The captain’s panicked reply, however, was just as damning as if he *had* helped the passenger escape. He’d just confirmed Amelia’s suspicions of his thievery. Still, he remained in the second most idyllic stage of becoming a thought-eater, ignorance.

She scooted a glass of water across the table. The captain lowered his hands and snatched it, choking on his first drink in days.

“What else will you have to drink? Tea, coffee?” Amelia offered.

The captain set his empty glass down, regaining some composure like a plant recovering from desiccation.

“Coffee and sugar would be a life saver,” he admitted.

Behind him stood a red-clad Vitam guardsman. Amelia gestured for the guard to take the empty glass and return with both water and tea.

“How would you sum up your journey, Captain?” she continued.

“M-my journey?”

“The course that brought you to this point,” Amelia clarified. As he pondered, the guard reemerged with two glistening glasses of water and a steaming mug. She slid the first glass over to the captain while quietly reminding the guard he’d forgotten the sugar.

After another desperate gulp of water, the captain began to recount the journey. 187 people had been on the *Queen of War* when it left the doomed continent. Nineteen died during the voyage—seventeen were buried at sea. This included the first captain, Captain Sobma. The chiller bags holding their bodies shimmered like neon scales, shed into the waves as the ship passed over the deepest trench in the ocean. The families watched as the bags winked and disappeared, finding some comfort that their loved ones now waited in one of the few places cold enough to let the restless dead sleep for certain. Two of the dead were not at risk of becoming thought-eaters, so were cremated in the boiler, a rare, miraculous fate. Their ashes belched out the smokestack, sparks dancing in death and propelling the ship all the further from doom. Conveniently, the pair had slain one another in a fight over the ever-dwindling supply of rations.

Eighty had debarked at the first dock that presented itself, a Clan port on the other side of the mountains. This did not include the family of three, but it did include the son’s girlfriend. She didn’t tell him of her plans, and he didn’t learn of them until they’d left the port. His heart broke a second time. At the next stop, sixty-seven departed, for this was the city of Sol-Circles, home of the unsick. The sixty-seven were not unsick, but were not yet ready to admit that, and hoped that being around the unsick would improve their own health.

Only twenty remained to arrive at Padma. This was the final stop for a new beginning, but first, they had to pass through Amelia—as countless others had done for decades.

Amelia scooted another glass over. “Not quite what I meant, Captain. How would you sum up the whole journey? Your journey.”

“There’s not much to say there, Ember.”

“Why didn’t you stay at Sol-Circles?”

“I’m not sure if they’d have me… but they definitely wouldn’t have taken the others. And I was the only one able to sail here, the last stop.”

“Before becoming captain, you were the night helmsmen?”

“Yes.”

“And the storm air hung so low that families were quarantined?”

“In separate cargo containers. Not really meant for people, but we were mostly able to make them airtight against the worst of the storms.”

“How long did they spend in the containers?”

“Nearly the whole journey… the storms were…” he shook his head. Amelia knew they were the worst in a century, so horrific it was understandable the captain couldn’t find the words for them.

“Yet, you know a lot about the family of the man who ran, but you said you never spoke to him.”

The captain sputtered into his glass. The statement, though delivered amicably, shook him as if she’d taken him by the hair and throttled him. The captain, having avoided eye contact with Amelia, looked on her now as if she were a fire threatening to engulf the tiny room.

“Towards the journey’s end we spoke… we had some time…”

Amelia shook her head, withdrawing the mug of coffee with a squeal of wet ceramic on wood to add four cubes of sugar to it.

“Who am I, Captain?”

“The Ember.”

“Start again,” she said, sliding the mug within reach of the captain, but he didn’t take it this time.

“I’ve… when the captain died-”

“-when he had to be chilled,” Amelia added.

“Yes. Afterwards, I was the only helmsman left. The whole ship took a meal together, thinking the worst had passed, but another storm loomed, and I… started to hear things. Brushed shoulders and knew names I’d never asked, it was odd, I knew other things… like their children’s names.”

“And yours?”

“Never had any of my own.”

“That’s not true.”

“No, Ember, it’s the truth. I’m quite sure... for a variety of reasons.”

Amelia Freed exhaled, allowing her gaze to wander from the captain for the first time since they’d met. He sunk back in his chair as if she’d just released his neck.

“Not all children are by blood,” Amelia began, “you were your parent’s child, of course, and if you were fortunate, they fed and housed you. If you were doubly fortunate, they nurtured you, steered you away from harm, and hopefully towards the next day, and the next.”

“That’s what you did by taking up the captain’s mantle. You guided them. You cared for them.”

“I… did I?”

“The log says you instated the quarantine order for the remainder of the journey. You locked yourself in the bridge, alone, bearing the brunt of the storm air with a leaky respirator.”

The captain winced at the last sentence.

“You kept your crew, your passengers, your *children* safe. You led them to port, guiding them as far as you were capable.”

“I don’t know if I did. I don’t know but I hope so. Always been a helmsman—it was all I knew to do.”

“All your life, you’ve been a parent. Every well-intended word of kindness, every act of community.” She nudged the coffee with sugar towards him again. “And like all parents, Jaco, there comes a time when you have to rest.” 

“Oh,” Jaco’s voice cracked. He brushed at his fingers, as if to hide his threadbare cuticles he’d picked at as he fought against the urges to dig more into his passengers. What else could he do for them if he only knew them better than they knew themselves? What could he make them do? But he hadn’t. He’d resisted. He took a drink of his coffee, the first sugar he’d had in a month. It was the sweetest, most comforting, most delicious thing he’d ever drank.

“You’ve come a long, long way.”

Jaco’s upper lip quivered, he spied what daylight he could through the cracks in the makeshift room. He tried not to let Amelia Freed see his tears, but it was impossible to keep anything from her. So, he stopped trying. He let himself ask, “Was I a good captain, shepherd?”

“Aye,” Amelia nodded, sliding her hand along the table towards Jaco. “And it’s time for us to leave her.”

Jaco straightened in his seat at this, remembering when his mother and father saw him off to his first assignment. It’s important to keep your posture, his mother had said. Stand like the earth is keeping you up rather than pulling you down, and everything else will fall in place.

It was his final thought.

The final Captain of the *Queen of War*, parent though childless, did not turn when the guardsmen buried the chiller needles into the back of his neck. A whisper of pressurized air announced the flooding of cryogenic fluids. His skin crackled like a frozen pond receiving the sun’s first touch on a crisp winter morning. He’d lived a good life. And it was on Amelia to carry his story forward.

\#

Amelia’s next stop was the son and daughter. They would be in a nearby, identical holding room, composed of the same canvas, bungee cords, and collapsible metal frames since the entire processing facility had been temporarily erected to receive these guests. She was understandably irritated to find the room empty, having to track down a guardsman with enough seniority to take blame.

“Apologies, Ember. They never arrived at the checkpoint.”

“Never arrived at the end of the hallway?”

“We’ll chase them down, Ember.”

A cursory glance down the aforementioned hallway was all Amelia needed. She waved a deferring hand to cut short the Vitam guardsmen’s concerted barks aimed at his fellows.

“I’ll handle it. Just open your eyes wider next time. I leave any additional reprimands to your discretion.”

Amelia had spotted a middle section in the hallway where some of the bungee cords had been undone. The gap was small, but large enough to allow absconding to the coastline. No matter. They wouldn’t have gotten far, and Amelia could use the stroll.

\#

Out of view of the Vitam, Amelia pulled at her collar in a vain attempt to loosen it. The Vitam had provided a uniform they felt befitted her position; a protective neck piece so large it resembled a yoke, and a coat in their universal style of ostentatiously red and bedecked with dozens of useless buttons. It sunk as far as her ankles, ruffling enthusiastically at the slightest of breezes. She watched from atop the beach ridge like a flapping red flag, hoping the noise would be obfuscated by the crashing waves.

Padma’s unwelcoming coastline offered few areas accessible to the waterline. The family’s escape window was also misfortunate for them, the short span of relatively clear skies where the morning mists had lifted and the palace veil had not yet overflowed to take its place. In minutes she spotted the pair of runaways waiting as their bobbing father battled angry waves. The father emitted a trail of steam like a dissolving block of dry ice. She knew from a glance that he would be worse than Jaco, another spinal column awaiting the needles of a chiller.

Amelia let him fight with the beach, a brutal palisade of fanged volcanic stone. It took several attempts for him to time the collision of the waves and the stones in such a way that let him topple over the first line of defenses, bloodied and battered. A normal person would have perished at the first go.

The son, a young man, kept the daughter held close with his one arm. Amelia first thought he was attempting to shield her willowy body from the wind but realized he was restraining her from rushing the beach, dismayed at their father’s struggles.

The struggle ended. A geyser of steam exploded from the father as he resorted to burning nanophire to overcome the final beachhead. In seconds the entire area cloaked in fog, reaching even Amelia from her vantage point. She let it wash over her, as the other option would be to withdraw from the beach entirely, and immediately felt the father’s awareness hovering in even the outer layer of the fog. She headed down for the trio as there was no point in remaining hidden if his dust field projected so far.

No sooner had Amelia spotted the father, a drab gray blob standing like some ominous golem within the mists, than he disappeared in a wisp of flames. Near instantly, he reappeared, clenching her Vitam collar. The gold armor cracked and crinkled beneath the pressure of his hands that she noted were black as soot. Burning fabric filled her nostrils. His touch ate through her collar, shattering the metal plating like snapping branches, and rapidly closed around her throat. Thankfully, because Amelia was Amelia, something her attacker was not anticipating separated his attack from her jugular.

A glimmer of recognition appeared in his burning eyes, set in the dark ash that now coated his body. She recognized him as well. His name was Oarmillion.

A lone spark ejected from his lips as he rasped, “I know you.”

Amelia replied, “were that true, you’d be running now.”

The pressure on her throat eased as shadowy fingers wriggled from her neck like night crawlers, intertwining with Oarmillion’s strangling grasp, pushing him away as two black, vaporous arms stretched out from Amelia. His hands caught the fringe of her coat as they were pushed back, spraying more tatters of red fabric and crumbling metal as a third appendage shot out from between Amelia’s clavicle bones and seized Oarmillion by his own neck.

“Shall we take a moment to catch up?” Amelia asked.

Oarmillion snarled and thrashed in response, so Amelia attempted to take the conversation by force. She connected with his dust field and saw Oarmillion in a tanker container, soaked in ember light. She saw him walking through sagebrush at dusk with his daughter riding along his back. Hungry mouths stalked the pair, yearning for thoughts and pain. She saw Oarmillion standing before a red bulb, massive as the sun, as it shattered. Oarmillion felt the breaking as viscerally as if it were his own heart because among the ribbons of fire and glass that fell like a thousand stars tumbled his wife’s small body.

“How would you describe your life’s journey, Oarmillion?” Amelia asked.

Oarmillion freed his hands long enough to pry the fingers from his neck, retreating with kicks and stumbles to avoid Amelia’s spectral grasp. A sizzle like frying bacon gave her pause. Her three extra arms, all protruding from her neck like macabre flower petals, were singed. Fingers evaporated like burning cigarettes. Vacant gasps of pain echoed out from somewhere within Amelia, a deep place, vast as a cavern.

Amelia took a deep breath, tasting the salt of the sea and the metal of the nanophire. The lights of the world dimmed. The mists and waves slowed to a crawl, hanging in place as if crystallized. As Amelia slid into the First and Gold to battle Oarmillion, she noted the daughter, while also frozen, had cast her gaze over her shoulders. Her eyes quivered and darted in unmoving sockets ringed with thought-eater scars. She had a touch of Gold then, a rare gift, and perhaps the first sign she was just as doomed as her father. 

Amelia set her intrigue aside as Oarmillion hurtled a rock at her head. She dodged the first few attacks, but Oarmillion’s touch, which allowed him to scoop jagged missiles of basalt from the ground like one would collect snowballs, also partially disintegrated his projectiles as he hurled them. Amelia simply cowled her eyes with her hands, her normal flesh and blood pair, as she strode through the embarrassing peppering of pebbles.

This caused her to miss his next attack, its first indication a sharp pain in her ribs. She thought he’d sneakily thrown a spear, as evident by the rod of rebar and crumpled concrete that had grazed her torso. But its appearance had been nearly instantaneous. The rocks had been a distraction then. She recalled that before the war that so recently destroyed half the world, Oarmillion had been playing both sides. She should expect more deception.

Though it had been years since anyone posed a challenge to Amelia, she left nothing to chance, sinking further into the First and Gold until a deep night blanketed the battlefield.

As she did so, the words, “Sihilde, skjold ubrutt,” slid from her throat.

Oarmillion attacked again, firing a long cylinder directly from his hand as if materializing it from nothing. The weapon, composed of concrete, glass, and metal, was like a core sampling taken not from a tree, but a building. However, in between it and Amelia’s head hovered a shadowy body. The body’s features were rounded by ethereality, but notably muscular, feminine, armored, and holding a broad, vaporous round shield. Oarmillion’s attack impacted the shield, redirecting at a near perfect ninety degrees to rise straight into the air. The rod crumbled slowly, bits of it falling away with the speed of snowfall, indicating that Oarmillion was unable to project his dust field far enough to incorporate it. Amelia recognized the opening and charged.

Amelia assessed Oarmillion through the shadowy body of Sihilde, her guardian, as she darted straight across the rough ground. She noticed a thin object, no larger than a pen, in his hand. He leveled it at her, but Amelia had already covered the distance. Sihilde slammed her shield down on Oarmillion’s wrist, snapping it. Oarmillion barked as the shield then careened into his face, sending him toppling backwards past his frozen children.

Amelia recovered his dropped weapon, a wood pen. Static nipped her fingers, and memories gushed from the pen. She saw images of Oarmillion’s wife, Treble, quivering over an empty bird cage. She saw Oarmillion drilling a bit into wood with the care of a surgeon. Amelia shook her head as emotions rushed from the pen, Treble’s conduit, no doubt. She bit her tongue to force her thoughts back to the present before Oarmillion could counterattack.

 Oarmillion steadied himself to his feet. He was gaunt, slick with ocean, filthy, and battered. Desperate sparks dribbled from his mouth as he grew sluggish. In another few moments he’d be completely frozen, unable to remain within the depths of the First and Gold Amelia had forced him into.

“Give it back,” he growled like a cornered badger. His non-broken hand slid behind his back. Still fight in him. Perhaps another broken wrist was in order. Amelia pressed forward to finish him off.

A third attack struck Amelia, this time, much larger. Even with her shadowy protector’s shield she felt herself flung backwards as if hit by a bus. Her vision likewise indicated the bus was made of a building, complete with regularly spaced windows and decorative reliefs. Through gritted teeth, Amelia said, “Ann Doni, who ran against time.”

Legs sprouted from Amelia’s body, too many. She became a sea-urchin of shadowy calves and thighs, each scrabbling against the building even as it continued to careen into her. Finding purchase to vault over it, Amelia rolled along the edge of the building that she discovered was horizontal and broken, firing herself back at her foe.

She stopped as another body had put herself between Amelia and Oarmillion. The daughter. Her face scarred. Her hair, a jumble of light and dark clumps, covered her eyes. She outstretched her small hands as if to appear much larger before Amelia, the many-limbed beast mauling her father.

Amelia had dropped so low into the First and Gold that even her own lungs crushed painfully. Seeing the daughter moving here baffled Amelia. She waited a moment to see if another building or apartment complex might hurtle at her. The young girl’s whistles of breath instead revealed she couldn’t keep pace with Amelia. In moments her color faded, and she once more stood frozen in Amelia’s black sea.  

“Oarmillion,” she called out across the darkness. “What have you done to your daughter?”

“Saved her from the fall,” he rasped.

One by one, Amelia’s superfluous limbs withdrew into her. She stood atop the jutting corner of the building that had assaulted her. It resembled an administration building, perhaps a city hall, unwisely commissioned to a fan of art deco with a flair for romanticism, weaponized by a girl no older than twelve and now lying flat on its side.

The dark lifted and the sea and mists churned once more. The daughter, exhausted, toppled into Amelia’s arms. She slid them both down to solid ground.

The Ember, Amelia Freed, knew enough of Oarmillion’s history to guess how the building had appeared. He’d not just fled the doom of the western continent but brought it with him.

Oarmillion cradled his broken wrist as he emerged from the other side of the building. His son, knocked backwards during the excitement, stared in bewilderment.

“You really did it. Was half the world not enough?” Amelia called to Oarmillion. “Sankt,” she added.

“No one who wasn’t there fighting Reverent has the right-” he croaked.

“We’ll have plenty of time to argue about it. A deal, Oarmillion. Amnesty. You’ll live outside Padma’s fence-lines with your family.”

Oarmillion lowered his shoulders, the unexpected offer having drained some fight from him. His eyes narrowed. “Sounds exciting, Ember.”

“I guarantee it, as we’ll be neighbors. And I’ll keep your daughter busy.”

“No deal,” he growled.

Amelia, who’d been expecting this flat rejection, did not raise her defenses. “Reverent was soulless. You’re the opposite. That makes you infinitely worse. You know what has murdered more humans than anything in our history?” She did not wait for his reply. “Loss aversion. And you are that thrashing, dumb beast made flesh.”

Amelia still held the daughter in her arms, light and frail. “I can see she’s that force but without your open wounds. That’s the combination we need more than anything. If we’re lucky, maybe that combination saves us all.”

“If not?”

“Then she’ll be a slightly faster death than the one slowly eating the air from our skies.”

Oarmillion scowled but considered the offer while gazing out at sea. He tried to pierce the deep gray line where sky and ocean met, to lift that curtain but realized the only thing he’d find was a lifetime of death and sorrow. The mists dampened his efforts like an uncaring shoulder shrug of the world. He looked at Amelia and shrugged his shoulders in turn.

And so, they all lived happily ever after… for about five or so years.",1,1766958841.0,fantasywriters,0,1.0,False

My husband and I are planning to buy a 2 bed, 2 bath apartment in Fernhill Gate, Leopardstown (D18). It’s a new A-rated build, priced at €545k, and we’re leaning towards it, but wanted to hear from people who actually know or live around the area.

We currently live in Sandyford near the Luas, with shops, cafés and restaurants all within walking distance, and we really value that lifestyle (we barely use the car).

For anyone familiar with Fernhill / Leopardstown, we’d love thoughts on:

	•	Grocery options day to day

	•	Schools / childcare (longer-term)

	•	Parks, green spaces, walks

	•	Coffee spots, restaurants or pubs nearby

	•	Overall vibe — lively, safe, walkable?

We’re also trying to sanity-check the price. With talk of a possible market “crash”, we’re wondering whether €545k sounds reasonable for a new build in this area, and whether now is a terrible time to buy or just impossible to time perfectly.

Would really appreciate any honest experiences or pros/cons, especially from people living nearby. Thanks!",1,1766958735.0,HousingIreland,4,0.67,False

I’ll be coming to Galway in a year and I’d really like to start getting to know some people before I arrive. Moving to a new city is exciting, but it’s always nicer to already have a few familiar faces around. Il be to Galway for a few day in february and if i like as i think il return in Summer 
A bit about me: I’m an Italian student interested in studying Creative Arts at the University of Galway. I’m a very creative person — I love writing stories, fashion and clothing design, art, and anything that involves imagination and self-expression. I enjoy deep conversations as much as relaxed walks, cafés, bookstores, and creative spaces. I’m non-binary and LGBTQ+ friendly spaces matter to me.
I’m mainly looking for friendships: students, creatives, locals, or internationals — doesn’t matter, as long as you’re open-minded and kind. Even just chatting online at first is totally fine.
If you feel like saying hi, giving advice, or meeting up for a coffee or a walk once I’m there, feel free to comment or message me.
Thanks in advance — looking forward to discovering Galway 🌊",1,1766958562.0,galway,0,0.6,False

I bought my partner a Delonghi Dedica E685 for Christmas to upgrade from her Aeropress in search of crema! We have made a few coffees since set up and are struggling to create as thick a crema as desired/creating watery tasting coffees!

We are using beans from a local coffee shop that were roasted at the start of the month and they then ground them for us at an “espresso grind” for an aero press (the coffee machine was a surprise at that point). We used 14g of this coffee as per recommendations and tamped with a delonghi metal tamp. In attached video, we measured the weight of the shot after and at 30 seconds it was 72g(!?). 

To my understanding, we should be aiming for a 1:2 ratio over a duration of \~30 seconds, which means we should be getting 28g after 30 seconds (i think! Happy to be corrected of course!)

1py2zm1,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1py2zm1/mils_humiliating_christmas_gift_and_scheming/,MIL's humiliating Christmas gift and scheming,"ever since my last post in this sub (see for context), a lot has happened. 
long story short, in the last post MIL got caught talking sh*t about me during my toughest postpartum period and after I confronted her, she denied and played the victim. 

well, DH and her went into this huge fight via text where she belittled me again. he was furious. DH and I had many exhausting talks on this topic and he decided he was going to have a serious talk with his parents. he laid down the rules - no more insulting me, commenting on me, no criticism of my parenting, etc. the talk went well but MIL insisted she wanted to talk to me, ""woman to woman"".

basically, her little sugar coated yada yada talk was how we are a conflict of generations and sometimes she has a bad day so things slip out the wrong way (whoopsie, right?! who doesn't have a bad day and then just goes on a full blown tirade about how her DIL sucks? 🤭) . she did say she was sorry for those messages. 

I told her I know about her other nasty demeaning messages she sent during the fight with DH where she's implying I'm lazy and modifying the truth to say I only worked for two months and quit during the whole time I was with DH. ""well I didn't mean it like that, I don't know exactly how long you worked (YES, YOU DO, I talked about my jobs ALL THE TIME), ""that's not what I meant"" , ""I only mean well"", ""I am a good person"" (repeated many times throughout the hour as if she's trying to convince herself, not me)"" yada yada yada. 

she said ""I'm sorry if that offended you"", I said that's not an apology. she then went on a full blown word salad, refusing to take responsibility and properly apologise to the point where I said I'm leaving this very moment if she doesn't. then she crossed her arms, slightly rolled her eyes and said ""okay, I'm taking accountability"" with a smirk on her face, as if she's being pulled into some ridiculous child play.  

I should have left there and then. go easy on me, I'm still learning how to draw proper boundaries. 
I realised anyways I am never going to get an apology, as if that would change anything since I hate all of them anyway. 
 
she also went on a tirade about my own mother and me (who is just as much of a JNM as MIL is a JNMIL but that's not the point here), saying, quote: ""I always felt an evil energy from you two"". what??! 
I guess the whole point of this meeting was for her to:
- make more excuses 
- offer fake apologies 
- point the finger at me and other people so that we can take the focus off of her
- sweet talk and compliment her way out

basically DARVO. 

I made it very clear the whole time that I'm not buying her bullshit, she accused me of being too harsh lol. I know I can appear VERY intimidating when I get angry and I was genuinely angry. 

she also complained how she only gets to see the babies for an ""hour"" weekly on a strictly scheduled time and how she can't come anytime she pleases. I explained that those visits are scheduled because surprise, surprise, babies have their own schedules and 3-4:30pm is a timeframe where they can spend 1.5 hrs of uninterrupted time with the boys because they don't have to eat nor sleep. I also said that anyone's visit with a baby doesn't revolve around them but around a baby. 


we eventually ended our little coffee date on good terms, until she hugged me and said I am like the daughter she never had. words cannot express my level of ick. I said good relationships take time to build and that I will need a lot of time to change my perspective on certain things, then we parted ways.

fast forward til early December. her and FIL came to visit for the first time since. 
FIL, MIL and I pretty much greyrocked each other until FIL's negligence caused twin B to fall of the coffee table and twist his neck leaving him with a bruise. (I posted this already here but it got removed since I focused too much on FIL. so I have to keep it short). FIL and I got into an argument - he made excuses, defied and disrespected me until I snapped, yelled at him and showed him the door. 

MIL followed him, not before saying ""babies are rubbery, you're making a big deal out of it"". I heard a lot of bickering in the hallway, MIL calling DH a ""Judas"", saying she didn't raise him like that. DH finds that hilarious. 

anyway, FIL apologised to DH via text later that evening, but refuses to apologise to me. they are both gravely offended I yelled, pointed at the door and they're offended because I was rude to him (that evening I told him I didn't give birth to my babies to have someone throw them off the table, how rude of me) 
DH was fully on my side even though he thinks I should have handled it differently. 

MIL then kept going on this tirade to DH via text about me being the rudest ever and making a bunch of mildly insulting, passive aggressive comments about me, while also saying how they are tired of always being the ones to have to apologise and again making herself the victim. 

DH went over to them on 26th to sort this out once again and they said they were sorry, they wanted to make amends, MIL is not taking this well, her BP is skyrocketing from stress, yada yada, but they were still gravely offended by my yelling and showing them the door. 

MIL sent a Christmas gift for me via DH. I received some sweets, an eyeshadow pallate and an apron that said something along the lines (English is not our native language):

""I don't yell, this is just how I speak""

at this point I don't know what to say anymore. I am not the one to be playing mind games. DH is fuming. for me, this is the last straw. 
he confronted her again and got the classic it was just a funny apron, nothing personal, I can't do anything without you guys getting offended, etc. FIL messaged him showing the apron he got
(apparently we all got a different one from MIL with some dumb ""funny"" inscriptions), saying we should stop looking for things to get offended at. 

poor DH, bless his good heart, he has been so conditioned by their behavior his whole life so he's still giving MIL the benefit of the doubt. 
""maybe she just didn't think this through"". 
I cannot believe this. 
I don't know what do they need to do more for him to finally realise they don't mean well for me. DH drew boundaries a couple of times already regarding me and they just keep stomping them while laughing at his face. 

yesterday, MIL invited my mom ""to talk"" (she never invites her over and ever since the first incident, she talks sh*t about her). my mother declined, saying she has plans. and this morning around 1:00AM I received a strange friend request on FB from a profile with a strange two letter both first and last name - and my MIL's full name in brackets (I deleted my in-laws on FB some time ago). WTF?! I don't like where this is going. 

today DH finally had epiphany, saying maaaaaybe MIL is putting all this show for him about how she's stressed and cares for us to sort this out, but she doesn't really care and just stirs the pot. 
bingo.

1py2y9i,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1py2y9i/rf_beyond_the_silence/,[RF] Beyond the Silence,"The first night in the new apartment ended for Nikola already when it was still dark, because a cockroach crawled across her face. She regretted her piercing scream for two reasons: First, she had probably woken her neighbors, and second, as a sound engineer, she regretted not recording it. Nikola couldn’t smother the creature with her shoe. What if cockroaches had families that would be grieving? Perhaps alive bugs were good bugs, too? So the eighteen-year-old caught the scurrying insect in a glass, took it downstairs to the ground floor, and released it on the street in front of the apartment. The asphalt was still warm from the relentless summer sun during the day.

This relentless sun returned early the next day as Nikola made her way to the set. On the way, she passed a cozy café. A metal sign read „Café Alianza“ in ornate script, above it a simple balcony that was already fully occupied by a single bicycle. Perhaps an athlete lived there. Nikola loved to go to the mountains to record sounds for her personal audio library: babbling brooks, hollow cowbells, whispering winds.

An old woman in a wheelchair squeezed herself through the glass door of the café. She had mousy gray hair and wore elegant clothes.

„Good morning!“, said Nikola, holding the door open for her.

„Hm“, the woman growled and drove on, her gaze so bitter, as if she had swallowed flies.

At the café, which belonged to the Alonsos, a nice Spanish couple, Nikola bought four coffees to go and brought them to the set.

There, her new colleagues from the sound engineering team had already fetched some coffees. „Hurry up, Schmiede is about to give a speech to mark the start of filming“, said Ben, her boss.

Albert Schmiede was the reason Nikola had moved to Munich. He had recently won an Oscar for „In the Face of Truth“, was now a superstar in the German film industry, and judging by the speech he was giving, he knew it. For the next few months, Nikola would be helping to film „Beyond the Silence“, a star-studded production featuring a lead actor who looked like a younger Schmiede and a lead actress who wasn’t an actress at all, but actually a model.

It was Nikola’s first film. She was intelligent enough to skip grades and graduated with top honors. But instead of becoming a doctor or a lawyer and making her parents proud, she went straight to the film industry, taking one of its lowest-paying and least prestigious jobs.

Unfortunately, she had seen „Once Upon a Time in the West“ far too young, and after learning that Italian filmmakers at the time added all sound effects and dialogue in post-production, she became obsessed with everything related to sound in movies: sound effects, sound editing, and the different types of microphones were topics she talked about so much, that her friends could quote her lectures on them. She also cursed them with the knowledge of how to spot dialogue added via ADR and played them audio libraries of stock sound effects that they would find unbearable to hear for the rest of their days. Once Nikola was established in the film industry, she would do everything differently.

But first, she would have to establish herself. And then her first film was with Albert Schmiede! What an opportunity!

The first day of shooting, however, was a bad omen. It lasted twelve hours without a break, and Schmiede and the lead actor didn’t agree during any of them. On the other hand, Nikola had the opportunity to secretly record a few new screams, all of which were genuine.

Exhausted, she arrived home, only to be greeted at her front door by a neighbor’s complaint about nighttime disturbances and in the kitchen by a family of cockroaches. Life always seemed to find a way into her apartment. She chased them away with a broom, nearly falling asleep with it in her hand.

The next morning, the old woman walked out of the café again and greeted her just as friendly as before. The bicycle on the balcony reminded Nikola of freedom. She could have almost the four coffees she bought today all by herself.

The first four hours of filming were not used for shooting. Schmiede was arguing with the lead actor, who was arguing with the producer, who was arguing with Schmiede. Nikola used the time to call her tenant, who didn’t feel responsible for the cockroaches. So she called the exterminator herself.

„We would have time on Thursday“, he said.

„Couldn’t you come earlier, maybe?“, Nikola asked. „I don’t mean to rush you, but…“

„Now, listen! You’re not the only customer we have to deal with! How is that supposed to work!?!“

„Of course, I’m sorry, but I’m new in town, I have nowhere else to stay.“

„So? Young lady, we’re exterminators, not real estate agents, you’ll have to take care of that yourself!“

„Nikola, come here!“, called Ben. „Schmiede’s had an inspiration!“

„Thursday’s fine, I’ll leave a key under the doormat, thank you very much“, Nikola ended the call.

Schmiede’s inspiration came from firing the lead actor and playing the role himself. He had his arm around the model as he made this announcement. Her face held a statuesque beauty, and her eyes searched for help.

Nine hours later, Nikola dragged herself to bed, but the leaden weariness didn’t help her sleep. Even in the dim light of her room, she could see the floor moving. She cried all night and in the morning didn’t know if she had slept at all.

Around noon the next day, Schmiede interrupted filming for an important phone call. He returned beaming and announced to the assembled crew: „The Baden-Württemberg film fund has approved! We’ll get a higher budget if we start filming in Stuttgart next week!“

„Where… where are we going to stay there?“, Nikola asked. „I just moved into a new apartment, I don’t have the money…“

„That’s not my problem!“, Schmiede growled. „Who do you think you are? Get off my set! You can come back tomorrow when you’ve sorted out your problem!“

Outside, the midday sun beat down like in a western, and Nikola felt like she was melting, not just emotionally. Her face felt as if she had looked into the Ark of the Covenant, and so did her heart and lungs.

As she passed Café Alianza, the old lady was sitting in front of it in her wheelchair. She wasn’t moving and was breathing heavily. Her face was so red that it was darker than her hair.

„For heaven’s sake!“ exclaimed Nikola, pushing the lady into the cool café.

Herr Alonso helped her bring Frau Hilbert, which apparently was her name, in the elevator up to her apartment. It was crammed full: two beds, a huge television, and several shelves packed with Blu-rays, DVDs, and storage devices that were older than Nikola. As she wrapped cool cloths around Frau Hilbert’s neck and legs, she let her gaze wander over the film shelves.

„What a coincidence, ‚In the Face of Truth‘!“, said Nikola. „I’m a sound engineer on Schmiede’s next film, ‚Beyond the Silence‘.“

„Oh, really?“ Frau Hilbert cleared her throat. „They say that guy’s a real asshole.“

„He is!“ Nikola laughed. „He had such a huge fight with the lead actor, that the guy left. And the model won’t be around much longer either.“ She paused. „May I ask who owns the bicycle on the balcony?“

„My grandson. He comes to visit occasionally. He lives in Stuttgart.“

„Is the second bed for him as well?“

Frau Hilbert nodded.

Now Nikola cleared her throat. „I don’t really want to ask you this, but… I have cockroaches in my apartment. Would it be possible if I could…“

For the first time, she saw Frau Hilbert smile. „If you tell me what Schmiede and his actor had a fight about.“

Nikola grinned. „I have something even better“, she said, pulling out the audio files of Schmiede’s screams. This was the beginning of a beautiful friendship.",1,1766957084.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Short Devotional about Hospitality

Introduction
------------

Hospitality is a beautiful expression of love and kindness, inviting others into our spaces and lives. It’s more than just opening our homes; it’s about opening our hearts. Imagine the warmth and joy that radiates from sharing a meal or a moment with someone. This is the essence of hospitality, a practice that not only blesses others but enriches our own lives with deep connections and spiritual growth.

In a world where connectivity seems both essential and elusive, the call to be hospitable offers a balm to the soul. Through hospitality, we share God’s love and extend His grace. Let’s explore how this divine calling can transform both the giver and the receiver, bringing us closer to Him and each other.

Bible Verse
-----------

“Do not forget to show hospitality to strangers, for by so doing some people have shown hospitality to angels without knowing it.” — Hebrews 13:2 (NIV)

Meaning
-------

This verse in Hebrews encourages us to extend hospitality generously and without prejudice. The idea of unknowingly hosting angels highlights the sacred nature of welcoming others with kindness and generosity. Each moment of hospitality is an opportunity to serve God and His creation.

In the early church, hospitality was vital for the community’s survival and growth. Believers recognized its power to form strong bonds and provide safe havens in a time of persecution. Today, the call remains the same. As we welcome others, we invite them not just into our homes but into God’s love and care.

Hospitality creates a ripple effect. The kindness you show to one can spread to many, fostering a community grounded in love. It transforms ordinary interactions into divine encounters, allowing God’s love to shine through you.

When we practice hospitality, we cultivate a Christ-like character. We step out of our comfort zones and embody compassion, offering others a glimpse of God’s kingdom here on earth.

Actions to Take
---------------

– Invite a neighbor over for a coffee or tea and get to know them better.

– Volunteer at a local shelter or community center to meet needs and share kindness.

– Prepare a meal for someone going through a tough time or just because.

– Create a warm and welcoming space in your home for unexpected guests.

– Pray for opportunities to extend hospitality and the courage to follow through.

Journal Prompts
---------------

– Reflect on a time when someone showed you hospitality. How did it make you feel?

– What are some barriers you face in being hospitable, and how can you overcome them?

– In what ways can hospitality be a reflection of God’s love in your life?

– How can you create a welcoming environment for others both physically and spiritually?

Prayer
------

Lord, thank you for the gift of hospitality and the opportunity to share Your love with others. Help me to see those in need of a warm welcome and to act with courage and kindness. Open my heart and my home, and may Your love be present in every encounter. Guide me to extend Your grace and kindness, knowing that each small act is a service to You. Amen.

Social Posts
------------

– “Hospitality isn’t just about sharing space; it’s about sharing our hearts. Extend love today! #BeHospitable #LoveInAction”

– “Open your door, open your heart. You never know who you might bless or how you’ll be blessed in return. #HospitalityMatters”

– “Invite someone in today and let them feel the warmth of God’s love through your hospitality. #SpreadKindness”

Conclusion
----------

The practice of hospitality enriches our lives and strengthens our communities. By welcoming others, we not only obey God’s command but grow in love and grace. Let each act of hospitality be a reflection of God’s love, carrying His light into the world.

 Noon

I've been spoiling my daughter. we ate fast food again. I ate three burgers. I have no idea why, I was just stupid hungry all at once. But I'm making food like usual at home, putting meals in the freezer like I do while he's gone so we can spend more time together when he gets home. Though the freezer meals I didn't add any salt to. They should taste pretty bad if goes to eat them. HA!



I took the boxes to goodwill. Ben met me there in the parking lot and put the two boxes for me in his car, along with the birth certificates, shot records and stuff. They will go in the rental when we leave. I stopped by Kroger, the lawyer wanted me to sign papers. He said no sabotage but he  laughed about the no salt meals. Im pouring the rest of the salt in the toilet before I leave. And I’m taking the coffee with me. 





4pm, 

I’m checking off the boxes on the spy list.  All the papers are with Ben and the boxes of our clothes. Bunny got washed and dried again because I couldn't stop thinking about it.  I made cookies this afternoon again. They are going with us in my bag.  My husband sent me a text telling me he knew I was sleeping around. I freaked out. I called the pastor. I didn't tell him anything about leaving, just the accusation. He says he will counsel us together when Dale gets home.  Then I used that as a reason to leave the house again and go to Walmart. I'm sitting in the parking lot to type this. We had fast food again. Extra fries for me, I’m so hungry. It will be easy to look like Ive been crying when I get home. I pray when I'm upset by kneeling at a chair, so I'll do that after I put my daughter to bed. And if I'm restless tonight and get up a lot it's because he accused me.  The salt is in the  McDonalds toilet with all the soy sauce. Coffee is in the diaper bag.  Im almost through my spy list and its only 3 pm. 



5 pm

Change of plans!! Lawyer sent a person to see if there are cameras outside our house besides the ring. I thought no, but he decided to double check. There are like 8 all around the house. Just after the guy from the lawyers office came to see, I got that text from my husband. He probably saw a guy on the camera and then said I was cheating with him. I was worried it was all the texting with my brother. 



So I was supposed to bring the car back here in the morning, but my lawyer is now sure there is GPS or air tags in the car. He wants to give me as much time as possible to get to my sister's house. So I'm to drive to Kroger, leave the car there in the grocery store parking lot with a big note on the seat of the car saying if there is a question about the car to call this number, and it’s the lawyers number. We will swap cars there, and the box for the phone is to be at the grocery store too, and then taken to the lawyer so there's no showing it at the lawyers address. My brother is doing all that. I have so much gratitude to him. It's 10 pm now, I'm in the bathroom typing this.  I'm going to bed, but I can barely stand it.

Only 10 hours more. 





Thurs



Dale’ll be home around 5 tomorrow afternoon. Ready for dinner. HA!



Right now its 7 am.  I’ve been cleaning since four like usual. We have a playdate at 10 (not really) and will need to stop by Kroger's for coffee first. We are out. Gee, no caffeine, no salt. At Kroger's we make the switch of phones. I'll turn it off on the way.  Switch phones, leave the car with the note on the seat.  There will be no reason to expect us home until noon at the earliest. Ava has a playdate. We should be at my sister's by noon or one pm. Easy spy mode. 



I should leave the house around 8am. Not too early to be suspicious. 

10 am

Hey! It kept our conversation on my new phone! Good for you, little note app! 

 I got to Kroger at 8:30, my brother was there. We sat in the rental and changed all my passwords to Google and everything so they are the same in the phone I had that is now with the lawyer, and this new phone with a new number. I left the paper with the lawyers number on the driver's seat, and left the old car seat in the car. Ben bought a new car seat for Ava and had already put it in the rental. He told me that he had been worried for a long time about our safety and he is so happy I'm leaving. 



On our shared calendar is a generic ""playdate"" note at 10 am. It's 10 am now and we just drove through McDonald's at a place out of town. I'm using cash for everything, my cards to our bank account are with the lawyer and he will send me money to a cash app as I need it, but only after papers are served so I need to make this cash last. Ben gave me money too. And Julie says she will make sure we have what we need. Ben said that my parents are in denial about how bad Dale is, and not to tell them more than I need to. My lawyer said the same thing. Anyway, back to driving. I just needed some caffeine for the drive. It makes me happy that I dumped the salt out. I smile when I think of it.



11 am

Stopping for a break. I’m shaking off and on. I don’t know why. I should eat a cookie. Spy cookie. My daughter is sleeping in her new carseat. Its so soft. The cookies are on a plate, I just walked out the door with cookies and a diaper bag like we were going out. I kept seeing things as if cameras were watching, as if I were watching myself on a security camera, as if it was a true crime on YouTube. It will look like I disappeared, I hope, for a day or two. Dale is supposed to be home tomorrow evening. But I am not supposed to worry about any of it, and not answer any messages from anyone on my messenger or Facebook. 

I have the secret app to message Ben, Julie and my lawyer.  Once my husband knows I left him, the lawyer will tell him where the car is, or have it taken home, and I will let my parents know I'm safe somewhere. There’s a cheap motel or two in town. Folks will think I’m at one of those probably.  Shaking is getting better. I need to get going. I am not speeding, but I wish I were there now. 



Noon

I'm at my sister's. I got here quickly. I tried not to speed.  She let the gate and security know, and gave them the licence plate numbers and descriptions of my husband's truck and car and my car. When the gate to her neighborhood shut behind me I wanted to cry. Julie is so nice, why did I think she hated me?



 

2pm

Just got a call from lawyer, police were called to my car at Kroger at 10:12 am. They were told I was in trouble because I was late for an appointment and not answering my phone, so they did a wellness check on the car's location. They saw the note, and called the lawyer, the lawyer told them I left but asked them to give me time. The police said they would stall, but the lawyer said not to trust it, that while most police are good, a few will think I'm wrong to leave with my daughter.  So it's possible my husband knows now, though maybe not. 



The car is getting towed home now, though. Either way, he will see the car get towed on the cameras, and the note in the car when he gets home. I had hoped to be here a day before I was called ""missing"" but the lawyer says this is ok, it will just show a judge how closely he watches me, and help me get a protection order as soon as we can. The lawyer told me to prepare for my husband to melt down and go crazy. I'm supposed to call my parents as if I'm at a hotel. Julie found a YouTube video that has hotel lobby sounds, and she'll play it in the background while I talk to my folks. I told her the motel I could afford doesn’t have lobby sounds, its by the tracks, so she’s playing far away train sounds.  She is in spy mode too. I have the location turned off on my phone, though they say it doesn't matter. 



But the lawyer let the police nearest my parent's home know so they can keep a look out and to take it seriously if they hear a disturbance at their house. Now I'm worried about them, but my lawyer said it's keeping them safe if they don't know anything and act like they are upset at me for leaving, which they will be. But I can call them once to warn them, and then they have to contact me through my lawyer. Everyone has to do that, is what I'm telling them. My sister and brother know that story too, and will go along with it. 



My lawyer said there will be messages coming in hot and heavy to my social media when he finds out, and theres nothing yet, so maybe that's good. When the messages come, I'm to ignore them until I talk with my lawyer, when we'll go through them together. If needed, he'll look at them on my phone that he has, and tell me what to do. 



He said that Dale has been in jail lately. He got a drunk and disorderly charge a month ago and was in jail three days. I thought he was at work. He'll get fired if they find that out. He also has a court date for ""brandishing "" for a different event at a different place, So maybe the cops will take anything that happens seriously.  I had no idea about any of this. I guess there's more, but that was enough for me to deal with, my lawyer said. He thinks a protective order won't be a problem though. He's got a court appointment for tomorrow to ask for one. I don't have to be there.



4 pm

The shaking is back. I feel like I’m freezing to death. I can’t get warm. My daughter is watching a video on a tablet my sister got for her. Julie has more guest rooms, but I want Ava with me. I panic a little when I can’t see her. 



I called my parents a while ago, talked to them both. Daddy was quiet, but said he was disappointed in me for ""quitting"". My mom was loud and cried. My mom said to stay at the regency (hotel near her) and she would come by and give me money until I came to my senses. 



I just told them what my lawyer said they should know and gave them his number. A few minutes later, my husband called the lawyer and asked for me, then hung up. 



A little later he found out my husband was arrested at the regency, and my lawyer called and said now he will be in jail till Monday for sure. I'm going to go to sleep, even though it's in the afternoon. My sister is taking my daughter to the library and then going to a park. For some reason I’m sleepy. I’m sleeping.





Wait. How did Dale get to the regency so fast? Im guessing my mom called him and told him I was there, and to come get his woman, but he’s a state away. Even if he had started driving home it would take several hours, but the lawyer said he was arrested an hour after I called my parents. That can’t be right. 

I’ll figure it out after I sleep. I might sleep all weekend.

1py2vxm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1py2vxm/thamior_part_2/,Thamior (Part 2),"My heart was already pounding. It was 9 AM, and I couldn’t decide what needed to be done. What if I had been hacked? What if it was Lana? She was a social-media buff; it could’ve been her. She might have asked one of her friends to hack into my account and mess with me. Just a harmless but idiotic prank.

I messaged her right away. I didn’t have much time left to slowly influence her into revealing the truth, so I confronted her.

“Hey… Lana, you need to stop doing this, okay?”
Her reply came instantly...

“What? What are you talking about?!”

“Hey… look, I know you guys are playing a prank on me. Please stop. It’s too much now,” I replied.

“You’re crazy. What prank? What are you even talking about?”

Her responses sounded genuine. I didn’t know if I should continue, because her denial would mean it was someone else, and that would be concerning.
I didn’t reply to her at all.
It was already around 9 PM, and I had to leave for the gym.

My gym routine involved an hour of cardio and some time with the dumbbells.
I had purposely chosen a gym that had fewer people coming in, and even then, my time slot was 9 PM onwards. By then, almost everyone leaves.
There were only two of us at first, the owner, who was partly asleep, and me.
But wait… three.
I saw another guy.

The guy wasn’t up to anything. He just stood there like he had no idea what needed to be done. I couldn’t see his face because of the glass that separated us. He looked quite well-built, though, and that made me believe he probably didn’t even need to work out.

Then I heard camera click sounds. The guy was probably taking selfies. I looked through the glass; his flash pierced it several times.
A while later, when I was doing cardio, I got to see his face.

He looked slightly familiar, but horrifying. Quite otherworldly.
What intrigued me was the fact that I was looking directly at him, but he behaved as if I wasn’t even there. Perhaps he didn’t like being gazed upon.
Then he turned around, stretched his arm upright, and started taking selfies.

I wasn’t in the mood to go home at all. I was worried for my safety; the thought of finding someone inside my house was concerning. But I had nowhere else to go either. I couldn’t avoid going to my own home.
I left the gym by 10:30. The other guy had already left.

At home, I was terrified, concerned about what was going to unfold. Yet, I still logged into the Thamior account to see if I could get some clue, if Lana had finally agreed or was giving hints that it was her all along, playing the prank.
Right after logging in, I opened the messages section.
Lana had blocked Thamior.

I didn’t expect that from her. She could’ve just refused to reply at all.
Then I accidentally clicked on my own profile, and it sent multiple chills down my spine.
Thamior’s profile picture had been changed.

And in the picture, it was him at the gym.
I was right behind him on the treadmill, photobombing his photo.

I didn’t know what to do next.
Now I didn’t need any answers from anyone. I was sure that Lana hadn’t done it, and my account wasn’t hacked either.
How did the guy look exactly like the one I had created?

Yet still, I was certain, if Thamior had invited Sophia to my place, then he would definitely come.
I locked every single door, window, and any kind of opening that could let someone in.
It was 10:54.

They were going to arrive within six minutes.
Six minutes later, I didn’t hear anything. No noise. No doorbell. Just nothing.
I kept waiting.
An hour went by.

I was kind of happy. I let out a mild laugh, because I was almost sure it was turning out to be a mere prank.

But before anything else, I opened the laptop to check for recent activity.

There was a message from Sophia:

“Can’t come tonight. I’ll let you know if I get the time tomorrow.”
There was no reply this time.

“And that means Lana had been playing a prank all along. When I confronted her, she chose to block me. She’d hacked my account. Silly me,” I laughed, saying this to myself.

Then I entered the bathroom to take a shower. I had forgotten to take one after coming back from the gym.
After five minutes of refreshing and relieving shower time, I came out.
I sat on the sofa and opened the laptop to watch some Netflix.
But then the open tab in the browser caught my eye.

The [REDACTED] site was still open.
Sophia had been replied to, just two minutes ago.

The reply read:

“Had a tough workout session at the gym today. See you soon, honey. I’ll pick you up. Now I’m gonna go enjoy my coffee.”

My body froze.

I had just come out of the shower. There was no way someone could’ve replied to her on my behalf. The doors were locked too.

Then I heard the clink of a mug against the counter coming from the kitchen.",1,1766956924.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False

We don’t have kids (and don’t plan to)

We have a dog that gets very nervous in busy urban environments but loves nature, trails, forests, water etc 

We don’t care much about nightlife but we don’t want to be isolated in a suburb where you need to drive to do or get anything 

Hoping to stay and put roots down in BC (moving from Ontario)

Ideal neighbourhood or city (of course, this is in a perfect world but we understand that having all of this will be near impossible!):

Fairly quiet and peaceful

Dog-friendly

Nature, parks or water nearby 

Walking distance to a couple places to go for a coffee or get a drink 

Big bonus if it is near good transit

Bonus if there is a community centre or library nearby

Regarding budget, we are very aware of the wild cost of living and unaffordable housing BUT we are curious about people’s suggestions just based on those points above and then hoping to look into them further to see if it’s somewhere we can actually afford.

Any suggestions, feedback, pros or cons of places you’ve lived etc would be appreciated! Thanks for taking the time to read and reply :)

——

TLDR:

Couple in mid-30s without kids asking for any suggestions for neighbourhoods in and around Metro Vancouver that are: peaceful, dog-friendly, nature nearby but not totally isolated where you need to drive to do or get anything. Bonus if there is nearby transit, community centre and library (but we know it will be near impossible to get all this in one place!). No specific budget because we want suggestions just based on just these points and then look into them to see if it’s somewhere we can afford. Thank you! ",0,1766956839.0,askvan,20,0.5,False

A burning ache in my shoulder slowly woke me. As I felt around the bed, Matthew was nowhere to be found. A wave of relief still resonating with me from the night prior calmed my mind. Good, he would ruin my serenity. 

I laid in bed for some time as the peace the window granted me slowly melted away, and my heart throbbed at the chilling loneliness it left. Now, I was a bit more frantic when I realized Matthew wasn't in bed. The hole in my chest needed to be filled. And Matthew was one of the few people that could do it. As I listened I prayed that the windows calls would reverb through the house once more, but I was only met with Matthew's phone playing shorts. 

With defiance and grief, I got out of bed and attempted to shuffle towards the sound of his phone. Walking was made difficult because of the pain in my shoulder, so I took my time and relied on the walls as my crutch.

When I finally made it to the kitchen, I saw Matthew sitting at the table hugging a mug close to his chest. He looked up from his phone and met me with a small, but warm smile.

“You’re finally awake, how'd you sleep?” He grumbled softly. 

“Muh” I grumbled back.

Before I could sit down, he pulled a chair out for me, stood up and started heading to the counter. “I didn’t give you your meds last night, but I'm not slacking on that again.”

“It’s fine.” My voice didn’t sound much better than his. “I forgot about them.”

When he walked back, he placed a fresh cup of coffee in front of me and gently dropped the pills in my hand. “Here you go.” He said with a quick temple kiss before sitting down. 

After washing my meds down I confronted him.

“Why did you get in the way?” I gently crossed. 

He looked up at me and his soft features slowly turned to concerns as I waited for a response. I let him take his time. 

“What?” Confusion colored his voice.

I sighed. “You were in our way last night. Why.” I was more stern with this demand.

He watched me for a long second. “What…?”

“Matthew,” the pain in my shoulder and his ignorance had my nerves shot, and I was a little too loud. “You stood in the way of the window. Why.”

He froze, mouth open in shock. “What are you talking about?” He finally whispered.

I put my coffee down so I could explain with my hand. “You were blocking the window last night.” My voice shook. “In the way of my window. My window…” Tears I wanted to shed last night at its beauty began to pour down my cheeks as I reminisced its absence. “You were right in between us. You ruined it.”

Matthew immediately moved his chair closer to me and gave me a light but firm hug while I cried. He waited several minutes to respond, his voice was as sensitive as ever. “Was this part of your dream last night? I heard you yell in your sleep, but I couldn't wake you up. I remembered the doctor saying that you could have nightmares from the antibiotics.”

I shot back before he could start again. “No.” I nearly yelled. “You are not going to fucking gaslight me. You saw me standing in the living room, you cleaned around me. You stood right in between me and the window on purpose. You didn't want me to see what was inside. You wanted it all to yourself didn’t you? Everyone saw it. They know!” He was gobsmacked, completely speechless by my accusations. But that was the only thing that made sense. He was trying to take it away from me. “Look at you!” I shouted. “You’re guilty!”

“Please, you're scaring me.” 

“Call them!” I screamed. “Call our neighbors, they saw!”

“...no, they’re still asl-” I snatched his phone off of the table and started dialing our immediate neighbor. It rang nearly all the way to voicemail before he answered. 

“Hey, you guys ok?” He grumbled, our call obviously waking him. 

“Tell Matthew what he did yesterday.” I demanded, almost cutting him off. “He’s fucking with me and lying about what happened. You all heard the window. He’s lying to me!” I was inconsolable now, reverting to ways I adopted when I was still with Sterling's mother. “Tell him!” 

That phone call was one of the worst and longest calls I've ever had in my life. No one saw me in the living room. The window never sang to me. I went to bed as soon as Dolly and I finished filing the restraining order. 

I was beside myself after that revelation. It took the better part of an hour of consoling and my meds kicking in for me to start calming down. 

Matthew texted everyone I asked to get confirmation for myself. Most of our neighbors texted back saying I was already in my room by the time they started working. As the realization set in more, I was horrified that antibiotics could make me have a dream so real, so extreme.

 I remembered how it beckoned me. I remembered how enthralling its melody was. I remembered the pain it took from my body as I listened. It all felt so real. How could it have been a dream. 

“I’m so sorry. I…I swear that all happened.” I cried into his shoulder. He held me close, one hand soothing my back and the other comforting my hair. 

“I’ll call your doctor and see what we can do. Please don't be hard on yourself.” He reassured, never letting his petting slow. With every stroke, the window’s allure grew farther. It howling my name sent chills through me. The smell of death and hell that caressed me. Its barren pit that teased me while trying to drag me in. What would've happened if I could move? What would it have done to me? No, it was only a dream. 

A moment's rest passed before Matthew said something I’d never heard after an argument. 

“I’m not mad at you.” His voice was so warm and coddled my ears as he whispered. Every part of my being clung to him as I buried myself deeper in his arms. He smelled like french vanilla and love. “I’m not mad at you.” This is what I needed to fill the void the window left behind. 

Time blended into nonsense as we sat and embraced. His small frame gave me the warmth of a mother, and I never wanted to let go. In that moment I was reminded why I wanted him. Why I needed him. He was the light the darkness in my life desperately craved. No amount of therapy, self help, or nightmares could replace what he’s done for me. 

After I was able to calm more, we talked about my baby boy. 

We agreed that it may not be the best option to bring Sterling home after what just happened. So after one long and pouting call to my sister, Matthew and I sat in silence at the table. His hand was soothing my knee and we both realized at the same time our coffees were cold. 

“Do you want a fresh cup?” He lulled. I wasn’t ready to speak so I just shook my head. By this point the meds had me sufficiently numbed. I wanted nothing more than to lay down and rest. But I had a feeling Matthew wanted to do more work today. 

We had no couch, no curtains, a partially shredded wall and carpet, and…no windows. 

Matthew said we had to get a couch at the very least today. But he also wanted to call his mom’s friends who renovate houses. They’d give us a good deal for damage repairs and glass replacements. 

“I have a few couches in my cart on the Ikea site you pulled up yesterday. Can we have them shipped express?” I questioned, finally finding my voice. “Or can we drive to Ikea and pick one up?” 

Matthew put his phone down, midway through dialing his mother, and watched me carefully before responding.

“I don’t remember doing that. Could it…have been part of your…” He struggled to finish his thought. I could tell he was worried I might fly off the handles again.

“Oh…right. Sorry.” I mumbled as the fridge kicked on. 

“I was thinking we could go to a local furniture store and have it delivered.” He started, getting up to refill his mug with warm coffee. “We have more than enough in our savings to splurge a bit on a new couch and carpet in the living room, especially if my mom can help us get a discount.” He placed the mug on the counter haphazardly, sloshing his coffee everywhere. I turned around to see him pouring his creamer. It gurgled a waterfall into his mug. 

“You making a mess back there?” I asked. 

He slammed the creamer back into the fridge, whose fan had been escalating.

“No?” He said, clodding back to his chair. The legs of his seat dragged loud and long against the floor as he scooted in. I grimaced at how clumsy he was being.

He continued. “I can also run into Home Goods or Target to get new curtains while we're out.” His lips smacked and tongue slobbered all around his mouth. “I won’t drag you in, but I will be fast.”

“Yeah, ok sure.” I almost interrupted.

He paused. “I can order them online if it’s easier.” His attempts at soothing irritated me. He slowly picked up his mug while it scraped across the table top. He vacuumed slurps and took gasps between laps. 

I closed my eyes and tried to get the noises out of my head. 

The A/C turned on and started blasting arctic air from across the room. I crossed my arms and tried to shake everything away, but it all crept closer. 

Then, like vines, vindiction gripped me.

There began that slow humming. 

Hisses from the coffee maker surged.

*Humming*.

Lights from the windows were piercing.

*Humming.*

The phone’s fan whipped manically.

*Thrumming*.

Dust pricked on my skin. 

*Thrumming*.

His breathing rattled my chest.

*Chanting*.

I buried my face into the table trying to escape the encroaching presence that was my surroundings. 

*Chanting*.

“Does your head hurt?” He yelled, the moisture from his milky, coffee breath stained my nostrils.

*Chanting*.

His muscles vibrated all around me.

*Screaming*.

He was only an inch from me as he raspily breathed all over my head. 

*Screaming*.

Slober flung onto my earlobe when his dank tongue licked his open mouth. 

*Screaming my name*.

He breathed into me. 

I breathed in all the rankness of spoilage in his stomach. 

***THWOMP***

***THWOMP***

Matthew backed away immediately and took with him all that was horrendous. 

***Knock, knock***

Before I could breathe, I shot up and nearly trampled him on my way to fling the door open.

On the other side was a cop duo, both taking staggered steps back and resting their free hands on their belts. 

“Take it easy, we're not here to harass you this time.” One spoke. I could see by their expressions my eyes were wild with stimulation. 

Matthew came around me and lightly nudged me to the side. “You know how much stress we've been under. We've barely gotten much rest since we saw you last.” He fought not to sneer. I remember him telling me about how relentless the cops were at the hospital. 

If we had a couch I would've sat down and tried to calm my breathing, but we had no such furniture so I had to stand and try to ease myself in full view of everybody. My hands were shaking and I felt the electricity of adrenaline surging through me. Every single one of my nerves sat on edge as I desperately forced my body to relax.

“I understand,” one of them started. “This won't take long.” 

After confirming who each of us were, they handed me a rolled up stack of papers. 

“This is the restraining order you filed. A judge granted your order ex parte and buried in there somewhere is your court date.” She pointed to the papers. “We just notified the other party, so if she does anything at all, call us.” She handed over her business card. ‘*Sheriff*’ was scrawled above her name. “And, person to person” She leaned closer to us, “she was pissed. So if you hear a peep or she comes and drives by at all, please call. We can’t do anything until it’s reported. If I were you I'd read over the order to make sure what she can't do.” 

“I’ll go over it with him.” Matthew said sternly. “Is that all?” His one hand slit to my back as the other grabbed the door. He could sense I was tense, but he must have thought it was from the knocking. 

“Yeah that's all we had for you guys. Take care of yourselves.” She said, side-eyeing me before they both left.

Matthew couldn’t shut the door fast enough. His gruff sigh breezed past me as he took the paper and guided me back to the kitchen. “At least it was something important.” He sat me back down at the table and watched me for a moment. “You going to be alright?” He placed one hand on top of mine and soothed me with his thumb.

My hands were still jittering from the sensational assault. He grabbed my uninjured hand and squeezed it tight, muffling the shaking my nerves granted it. My other hand rattled in its sling uncontrollably.

“It’s already been a long day hasn’t it.” He stole a quick glance at the oven. I looked over and its face said it was only ten in the morning. He grabbed both of my hands trying to prevent them from shaking. All of my energy transferred to my bouncing legs. Adrenaline licked hot and fierce at my body and I couldn't stop any part of myself from vibrating. 

Hot tears streamed down my cheeks once more. I couldn’t hide anymore that I hit my tipping point. “Can you lay down with me,” my voice quivered. “Please.” I looked down at my feet, ashamed. I was quickly becoming a wreck. The manic meltdown I had earlier had me teetering on the edge of stability, but the assault I had just bore sent my flying over that fragile line. “I just want to lay down. I don’t want to be alone.” I didn’t want to be alone with my own thoughts. The narcotics weren't numbing me enough after that. 

I began to weep, truly letting everything go with my shoulders shaking and screaming in pain. There was no anger. No defiance. Nothing to prove. I was defeated into a failure. My own senses violated me. 

I cried. I sobbed. I was back in my old apartment with my ex. Locking myself in the bathroom after she fell asleep. Bruises plastered all over my face and neck, my nose bloody and crooked. I was attacked. And I cried just the same. I felt pathetic then, and I was just as small now. 

Matthew embraced me once more, but I couldn't welcome it like I had earlier. As much as I wanted to curl up in his arms, I wanted just as much to lock myself in that bathroom again and curl up on the floor. What an embarrassment of a man I was. Crying over what? Noises? Smells? What a fucking spineless bastard. Pathetic. 

I didn’t know when or how I made it to my room, but after dissociating and coming back, I was wrapped up in a heavy quilt resting on Matthew's soft stomach. I had stopped crying, stopped feeling. I was finally numb again, soul deep. I was way too familiar and comfortable in this pit. This cavern used to be my home for years, and I embraced it for fear of feeling anything anytime soon. Soft snores filled my ears and I felt Matthew’s stomach slowly rise and fall. I couldn’t tell if I had fallen asleep in my memory lapse, but even if I did, it didn't change how little energy I had. I was still exhausted, to the bone. I tried propping myself up to see what time it was and accidentally woke my sleeping beauty from his peaceful slumber. It was now two.

Matthew hummed as his arms wrapped around me. We laid silently in the warmth of each other's embrace. This didn’t help me escape the hole I was buried in, but it made the confines more tolerable. 

By the time he had fully woken up, Matthew’s phone alarmed for me to take my next dose of medicine. The weight of the blanket and his warmth made it nearly impossible to get out of bed, and he must have known that. Before I could even think to protest with a groan, he wriggled out of my grasp and wordlessly helped me to my feet. The sun was out and we still had things to do. 

After silently giving me my meds and one more hug, we went back to our room, got dressed and headed to his car. 

The rest of the day I didn't speak. I nodded and shook my head until we found a couch Matthew loved. We got lunch and he had to order for me. I barely touched my food.  The delivery truck beat us to the house and set up the couch for us as we waited silently in the kitchen. By sunset we sat on our new couch, with teriyaki, sushi and cookies all on their way from our favorite local spots. Matthew called his mother’s friend while we waited and all I could muster was to lay on his lap.

The entire afternoon and evening was lackadaisical and completely deprived of my normal enthusiasm. Even with his best effort, Matthew couldn't get me to open my mouth for anything but the food he forced me to eat. He watched a few episodes of his comfort show and I drifted through sleep fully conscious. 

After he put dinner away, we got my last dose of medicine for the day before he walked me to bed. And as the drugs worked their way into my veins and let me finally get some restless sleep, I wandered into oblivion with the sound of Matthew in the other room crying to his mother and chanting my name.",1,1766956686.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False
1py2s70,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/1py2s70/resolve_automates_new_year_resolution_workshops/,Resolve - Automates New Year Resolution Workshops in Amsterdam,"I just shaped a fresh-start automation for a coach who hosts New Year resolution workshops in a canal-side studio in Amsterdam. As January approaches, people flood in for vision boards, accountability buddies, and gentle goal-setting, but coordinating materials, tea preferences, partner pairings, and “is it too intense?” questions was turning her hopeful space into an overwhelming one. So I created Resolve, an automation that begins like the first page of a new journal, turning the start of the year into effortless, inspiring gatherings full of Dutch directness and warmth.

Resolve uses Make as the quiet coach and Eventbrite to gather the dreamers. It’s clear, motivating, and runs itself. Here’s how Resolve builds:

1. Only 18 spots open on Eventbrite on December 28, with one question: “Black coffee, tea, or cocoa?”
2. Make checks the Amsterdam forecast at noon; if rain is heavy, it auto-adds extra indoor lighting and notifies everyone with a photo of the cozy canal view.
3. 48 hours before, each participant gets one SMS: studio door code, “Bring one word for your year,” and a short Dutch new-year wish.
4. When the circle begins, the coach gets one Slack message: “18 souls arriving, 10 want tea, magazines for vision boards ready, candles lit, year open.”
5. The morning after, every participant receives a delayed WhatsApp with a photo of their vision board corner and a one-tap “Book February accountability checkin” button.

This setup is pure Amsterdam new-year energy for resolution coaches, goal-setting hosts, or anyone helping people step boldly into January. It removes every hesitation and leaves only the clarity of intentions, the snip of magazines, and the quiet power of a year waiting to be shaped.

1py2s6x,https://i.redd.it/owqwg4jdh0ag1.jpeg,Milk-washed Trinidad Sour,"As somewhat expected, the Trinidad Sour did not go over very well with my family on Christmas Eve. With more of a batch left over than I wanted to drink, I tried my hand at milk washing and it turned out really well. The Trinidad Sour is an INTENSE drink. The milk washing mellows it out a lot while still keeping the core flavor profile of the bitters there. It’s more of a hint of clove vs. getting punched in the face with it. Overall I wouldn’t recommend doing this, as the amount of bitters are costly and you can probably get a similar effect with a recipe adjustment, but it was a fun experiment and I’m happy with the result.

Base Recipe is the standard: 1.5 oz Angostura Bitters, 0.5 oz Elijah Craig Rye, 1 oz lemon juice, 1 oz Liber & Co. orgeat. Batched to 6-7 servings with some adjustments made with lemon, bourbon, and simple syrup (i.e. the remaining ingredients I had on hand).

Milk washing: 10:1 of the Base Recipe to whole milk. While milk poured in, sat in the fridge for \~6 hours, strained with an assortment of mesh and coffee filters.",7,1766956674.0,cocktails,3,1.0,False

""A detective's evidence board investigating \[SUBJECT/MYSTERY\]. Cork surface covered with pinned items: polaroid photographs with handwritten dates, a street map with circled locations, newspaper clippings with highlighted passages, sticky notes with theories and question marks, and printed documents with redacted black bars. Red string connects related evidence across the board, creating a web of connections. Thumbtacks in primary colors. A single bare bulb casts dramatic shadows. Coffee ring stains on some papers. The atmosphere is obsessive, late-night, noir—someone has been piecing this together for months. A few pins have fallen, suggesting frantic recent activity."" 

This piece shows a **detective’s evidence board investigating an unresolved mystery**.  
The cork board is filled with polaroid photos marked with handwritten dates, a street map with circled locations, newspaper clippings with key lines highlighted, sticky notes full of theories and question marks, and official documents partially censored with black redaction bars.

Red string connects everything, forming a chaotic web of relationships. Some pins have fallen, hinting at recent panic or a breakthrough that went wrong. Coffee stains, curled paper edges, and uneven lighting add to the sense of obsession. A single bare bulb hangs above, casting dramatic shadows across the board — late-night noir energy.

The idea was to make it feel like someone has been chasing the truth for years… and might be getting uncomfortably close.

1py2qet,https://i.redd.it/o0wk9k10h0ag1.jpeg,Beckoning Dirt,"The farmhouse had always been a little too far from everything, perched on the edge of the vast plain like a forgotten relic. Out there, where the horizon swallowed the sun whole each evening, the sky stretched impossibly wide, making a man feel small and exposed. The wind howled across the open fields with relentless fury, carrying the scent of dry earth and distant rain, bending the tall grasses into submissive waves. The house itself was ancient even when Markus and Lydia first laid eyes on it—its gray boards weathered to a ghostly silver by decades of sun and storm, the roof sagging in the middle like the spine of a weary old horse burdened by too many years. Paint peeled in long, curling strips from the shutters, and the porch creaked underfoot as if whispering secrets of all the lives it had sheltered before. But Lydia had fallen in love with it instantly. She’d stood in the overgrown yard that first day, hands planted firmly on her hips, her auburn hair whipping wildly around her face in the gusts, and declared with that unshakeable certainty of hers, “This is ours, Markus. We’ll make it sing.”

And for a time, it did. The house came alive under their hands. They scrubbed away layers of grime, mended the fences that snaked crookedly across the property, and planted a garden that bloomed with defiant color against the barren landscape. Lydia’s laughter echoed through the rooms as she hung curtains she’d sewn herself, bright patterns that caught the light and danced across the walls. Markus, with his strong, calloused hands from years of labor, fixed the leaks and reinforced the beams, all while stealing glances at her, marveling at how she could turn a rundown shack into a home. Their daughter Mira arrived two years later, a bundle of joy with curls as wild as her mother’s and eyes that sparkled like the first stars at dusk. The farmhouse rang with the patter of her tiny feet, her giggles mingling with the crackle of the woodstove and the soft hum of Lydia’s herbal teas brewing on the range.

But now, those echoes had faded into silence. Markus sat at the scarred kitchen table every day until the light bled from the sky, his hands wrapped around a mug that hadn’t held hot tea in weeks. The chamomile-mint blend was Lydia’s own creation; she’d grown the herbs herself in neat, thriving rows along the south wall of the house, tending them with the same gentle care she gave to everything she loved. He still kept the jar on the highest shelf, half full of dried leaves that crinkled like old paper when he shook it. Some mornings, when the loneliness clawed at him most fiercely, he’d lift the lid just to inhale what lingered of her— that earthy, soothing aroma that carried hints of summer afternoons and her warm embrace. He’d close it quickly, as if opening it too often might dissipate her essence entirely, leaving him with nothing but empty air.

He hadn’t spoken aloud in so long that when he finally tried—testing his voice one desolate evening by murmuring “Lydia” into the empty room—it emerged rough and cracked, like a rusty hinge protesting after years of disuse. The sound startled him, echoing off the walls in a way that made the house feel even more hollow. He didn’t try again for days, retreating instead into the quiet rituals that kept him tethered to the world. The days themselves had lost their shape, blending into a monotonous haze. He’d wake in the bed that was still made up on both sides—he couldn’t bear to disturb her pillow, with its faint indentation where her head had rested—and lie there for hours, listening to the house settle around him: the groan of timber contracting in the cold, the distant drip of water from a leaky faucet, the sigh of wind slipping through cracks in the walls. Eventually, hunger or habit would force him up. He’d build a small fire in the stove, its flames flickering weakly like his own resolve, heat water in a dented pot, and eat whatever was easiest—usually just a hunk of bread gone stale and hard, or a potato boiled until it turned to mush. Taste didn’t matter anymore; food was merely fuel to keep the body moving, a mechanical necessity in a life stripped of joy.

Outside, the land stretched flat and unforgiving under an indifferent sky. The black soil baked hard and cracked in the summer heat, only to transform into a sticky, sucking gumbo when the rains came, clinging to boots like reluctant hands. Lydia had worked miracles with it anyway, her determination turning barren patches into verdant oases. She’d spent hours on her knees in the dirt, her fingers delving deep into the earth, coaxing life from it with whispers and care. “Come on, little ones,” she’d murmur to the seeds as she planted them, her voice soft and encouraging, as if they were shy children needing reassurance. Mira would trail after her with a little tin bucket clutched in her chubby fists, dropping in beans or peas with solemn concentration, her tongue poking out in focus. Markus used to watch from the porch, his coffee steaming in the cool morning air, feeling a swell of contentment that made his chest ache with gratitude. He was the luckiest man alive, he’d think, surrounded by this simple, profound love.

But those memories ambushed him now without mercy, striking like lightning in a clear sky. He could be out chopping wood, the axe rising and falling in rhythmic thuds, when suddenly he’d see Mira running toward him across the yard, her arms flung wide, her voice a gleeful shriek: “Daddy, catch!” He’d drop the axe instinctively, bracing for the impact of her small, warm body slamming into his legs—only to blink and find nothing but empty air and swaying grass. The absence hit harder than any physical blow, a visceral punch that doubled him over. He’d sink to his knees right there in the dirt, the axe forgotten beside him, and cry until his throat burned and his eyes swelled shut, great heaving sobs that wracked his frame. Some days, the grief felt like a physical weight pressing down on his chest, squeezing the air from his lungs until he gasped for breath. Other days, it manifested as a hollow, echoing ache deep inside, a void that swallowed every attempt at normalcy.

He saw them everywhere, these ghosts of what was lost. A flash of auburn hair caught in the hallway mirror, vanishing when he turned. The faint sound of humming drifting from the kitchen as he entered, only to dissolve into silence. Once, he woke in the dead of night, certain he’d heard Mira’s voice calling “Mama” from the nursery, high and plaintive. His heart pounded like a war drum as he stumbled down the dim hall, bare feet slapping against the cold floorboards, fumbling with the locked door. Inside, the room was untouched, dust thick on the tiny bed like a shroud, toys lined up exactly as she’d left them— the stuffed bear with its button eyes, the wooden blocks scattered in mid-play. He collapsed into the rocking chair, clutching the carved wooden horse she’d adored, its mane worn smooth from her tiny fingers. He rocked slowly, back and forth, the creak of the chair the only sound, while tears streamed down his face, soaking into his shirt collar until the fabric clung damply to his skin. He stayed there until dawn painted the windows pale gray, the first birdsong mocking his vigil.

Six months had passed since the fever stole them away. It had descended suddenly, the way terrible things always do, without warning or fairness. One week, the distant village bustled with normalcy—farmers haggling at the market, children chasing each other through dusty streets, the air alive with the clang of blacksmith hammers and the lowing of cattle. The next, whispers of illness spread like wildfire, and people began dying in their beds, their bodies wracked by unrelenting heat and delirium. Markus had barricaded the family inside the farmhouse, boiling every drop of water, burning bundles of sage as the old women in the village had recommended, their wrinkled faces grave with ancient wisdom. He’d nailed boards over the windows to keep out the wind that might carry contagion, rationed their stores with meticulous care. But sickness doesn’t heed precautions; it slips through the cracks like smoke.

Lydia woke one morning with heat radiating from her skin like a forge, her forehead slick with sweat despite the chill in the air. By evening, she was delirious, thrashing weakly under the quilts, calling out for water in a voice hoarse and broken, then for Mira with a desperation that tore at Markus’s soul. He bathed her fevered brow with cool cloths soaked in well water, spooned thin broth between her cracked lips, and prayed in a voice he barely recognized—raw, pleading, bargaining with a God he’d never been particularly devout toward. “Please,” he’d whisper, his hands trembling as he held hers, “don’t take her from me. Not her.”

Mira succumbed two days later, her small body betraying her with sudden shivers and whimpers. “Daddy, I’m cold,” she’d cried, her voice confused and fragile, her eyes glassy with fever. He wrapped her in every blanket he could find, held her against his chest where his heartbeat thundered, feeling her little heart flutter too fast, like a trapped bird. Lydia, barely conscious and propped up on pillows, reached out a trembling hand toward the crib, her fingers grasping at air. Markus carried Mira to her bedside so their hands could touch one last time—mother and daughter, connected in that final, heartbreaking moment. Lydia’s lips moved in silent words of love, her eyes brimming with tears that mirrored his own.

He buried them together under the big willow at the back of the yard, its massive trunk twisted like an ancient sentinel, its branches hanging low and brushing the ground like mourning veils. The soil was soft from recent rains, yielding easily to the shovel’s bite, each scoop a fresh wound in his heart. He dug until his hands blistered and split, blood running down the wooden handle and mingling with the dark earth, turning it into a muddy paste. When the graves were deep enough—deep enough to protect them from scavengers, deep enough to hold his shattered world—he wrapped them in the quilts they’d cherished: Lydia’s wedding quilt, embroidered with flowers in threads of gold and blue, and Mira’s baby blanket, soft and faded from countless washings. He lowered them gently, Mira nestled against her mother’s side just as she used to sleep, their forms peaceful in eternal repose. He covered them slowly, shovel by shovel, whispering apologies with every layer of dirt. “I’m sorry I couldn’t save you. I’m so sorry.” When it was done, the mounds fresh and raw under the willow’s shade, he collapsed across them, his body heaving with sobs until his voice gave out, raw and spent, and the world blurred into numb exhaustion.

After the burial, he couldn’t stop digging. He’d venture out at dawn with the shovel slung over his shoulder, carving trenches across the yard in random, frantic patterns, as if he could tunnel down to them if he just kept going, if he could breach the barrier between life and loss. His hands scarred over time, the skin thickening into calluses like bark, but other changes crept in unbidden: a grayish cast spreading across his face like ash, veins darkening under the surface like inky rivers, a constant chill settling into his bones that no fire could chase away, no matter how fiercely it roared in the hearth.

Some nights, driven by a compulsion he couldn’t name, he’d end up beside the graves, his ear pressed flat to the cold earth, talking into the dark void below. “I miss you so much it hurts to breathe. I’d trade places if I could. I’m sorry I couldn’t save you.” The words tumbled out in a rush, laced with desperation and love. The ground never answered, but he kept talking anyway, for hours sometimes, until the frost stiffened his joints and the stars wheeled overhead in silent judgment. He’d stagger back inside as dawn broke, his body aching, his soul scraped raw.

He scratched tally marks on the kitchen wall with a dull knife—one stark line for each day survived without them. The wall filled slowly, a grim calendar of endurance. Food stores dwindled; he ate less and less, his clothes hanging loose on a frame that seemed to shrink by the week, bones protruding like accusations. The house decayed alongside him: wallpaper peeling in yellowed strips, damp spots blooming across the ceiling like bruises, a pervasive smell of mold rising from the warped floorboards, mingling with the dust and neglect.

One crisp morning, a crow flew full-speed into the kitchen window with a sickening thud, dropping dead on the sill, its beak agape in silent protest. Markus carried it outside, the body still warm in his palms, feathers glossy black and iridescent in the sunlight. He dug a small hole beside the willow, the earth parting easily, and buried it with a strange reverence. When he brushed the dirt from his palms, it clung strangely, staining the lines of his skin dark and stubborn. The smell was sweet and wrong, like overripe fruit mixed with decay, lingering on his hands long after he washed them.

That night, he dreamed of voices rising from under the earth—soft, overlapping murmurs calling his name like a haunting lullaby, pulling at him with invisible threads. He woke sweating, the sheets twisted around him, his heart racing as if he’d been running through endless fields.

Winter closed in hard and unyielding, snow piling against the doors in drifts that sealed him in like a tomb. The road to the village vanished under a white blanket, rendering it as distant as a half-remembered story from another life. Isolation wrapped around him tighter than any blanket. One dusk, as the light faded to a bruised purple, he found the nursery door ajar. He hadn’t touched the lock in months, its key hanging untouched on a nail in the hall. His breath caught as he pushed it open, the hinges creaking in protest. Inside, the air hung thick with dust and memory, particles dancing in the slanting light like tiny ghosts. He sat in the rocking chair with Mira’s wooden horse cradled against his chest, its painted eyes staring blankly, and stayed until the windows turned pale with morning. His knees cracked like dry branches when he finally stood, joints aching deep within, as if roots were trying to take hold in his marrow.

Then the scratching started—faint at first, a subtle scrape beneath the floorboards, like nails dragging slowly across wood. Pause, scrape, pause again. He told himself it was rats, scavenging in the crawlspace, but the sound moved with purpose, following him from room to room as he paced the house. Some nights, he’d lie awake with his ear pressed to the planks, whispering hoarsely, “Is that you? Lydia? Mira?” The scratching would pause, as if listening, then resume, closer, more insistent, sending shivers through his body that weren’t entirely from fear.

He stopped sleeping much after that, his nights fractured into restless vigils. Dark circles bloomed under his eyes like shadows, deepening the hollows of his face. He carried the shovel everywhere now, gripping its handle like a talisman, a promise of action in a world gone still. Food lost all appeal; he’d stare at a plate of cold porridge until it congealed, then push it away untouched. But the scent drifting up through the widening cracks in the floor—rich, loamy, alive with the promise of growth—soothed the raw edges of his grief like a balm. He’d kneel and breathe it in deeply, filling his lungs with its earthy essence, and for just a moment, feel less alone, as if the ground itself was offering companionship.

Once, in a haze of exhaustion, he saw Lydia standing at the edge of the field, her white dress fluttering though the air was dead calm. Her hair cascaded loose over her shoulders, just as he remembered. He ran toward her until his lungs burned and his legs trembled, calling her name in a voice cracked with hope. But when he reached the willow, there was nothing but trampled grass and the whisper of leaves. His hands were bloody again, scraped raw from a fall he had no memory of, the pain a distant echo compared to the fresh wound in his heart.

The tallies on the wall stopped mattering as time folded in on itself, days blurring into nights without distinction. Grief remained vast as the plain outside, an ocean he drowned in daily, but it had begun to change shape—becoming something heavier, slower, more patient, like the gradual shift of seasons.

The second winter moon rose huge and orange, hanging low on the horizon as if it yearned to touch the sagging roof. The house felt closer to the ground now, as if the earth had started pulling it down inch by inch, reclaiming what was built upon it. Doors stuck stubbornly in their swollen frames, requiring a shoulder’s force to open. Walls leaned inward just enough to notice, creating a subtle claustrophobia that pressed on Markus like an embrace. He could lay his palm flat against the plaster and feel a slow pulse thrumming beneath, steady and deep, matching the sluggish beat in his own chest, as if the house had developed a heartbeat of its own.

He started talking again because the silence had become unbearable, a void that amplified every creak and sigh. At first, just fragments—“I miss you,” “I’m sorry”—muttered into empty rooms, his voice tentative, testing the air. Then, as the words flowed freer, whole stories poured out: the day Mira was born in the midst of a spring storm, how Lydia had laughed through the contractions, her face flushed and fierce; the summer they’d painted the porch together, ending up splattered in blue from head to toe, collapsing in giggles on the steps; the night they’d danced in the kitchen to a crackling old radio song, Mira clapping her sticky hands from her highchair, her face alight with pure delight. Saying their names out loud hurt like pressing on a fresh bruise, a sharp twinge that radiated through him, but it hurt less than the alternative—never hearing them at all, letting them fade into oblivion.

Sometimes the echoes came back strange—too soft, too close, like breath ghosting across the back of his neck. He’d whirl around, heart leaping, only to see dust drifting lazily in the moonlight filtering through grimy windows.

He gave up lighting candles after a while; the dark felt kinder, more forgiving. Moonlight through the cracked panes painted everything in ethereal silver and revealed things he’d missed in the harsh flicker of firelight: faint handprints smudged on the wallpaper, small child-sized ones overlapping larger, more elegant ones; shapes that shifted in the corners of his vision, dissolving when he looked directly at them, leaving him questioning his sanity.

The scratching grew bolder, more confident, following intricate patterns now, especially under the nursery floor where the wood was thinnest. He began answering it—tapping once for yes, twice for no, asking simple questions into the grain of the wood with a voice hoarse from disuse. “Are you cold? Do you miss me?” The replies came quicker, clearer, a rhythmic dialogue that bridged the barrier between worlds. Some nights, these conversations lasted hours, the taps evolving into a Morse code of longing. He’d fall asleep with his cheek pressed against the floorboards, waking with grit embedded in his skin and a strange calm settling over his chest, like a weight lifted.

He dreamed of Lydia often, her presence so vivid it blurred the line between sleep and waking. In one recurring dream, she stood in the kitchen doorway, smiling gently even though her eyes were dark hollows, shadowed and empty. “You left us down here alone,” she said, her voice soft as falling dirt, carrying the faint crunch of soil. “It’s cold without you.” He’d reach for her, fingers outstretched, only to wake gasping, his heart stumbling erratically, skin clammy with sweat. But the cold that seeped into his bones didn’t bother him as much as it should have; it felt familiar, almost welcoming.

He tried to leave once, in a fleeting moment of clarity. It was a clear morning, frost glittering on the fields like scattered diamonds under a pale sun. He packed a small bundle—stale bread, a sharp knife, Lydia’s woolen scarf that still held a whisper of her lavender scent—and stepped out the door, his boots crunching on the frozen ground. Fifty steps from the house, he turned to look back, compelled by some invisible pull. Every window held a reflection of his face, dozens of them staring out, each wearing a different expression: raw grief twisting features, rage contorting mouths, emptiness hollowing eyes, pleading desperation in furrowed brows. The ground near the willow had sunk lower, forming a gentle depression like a nest waiting to be filled. Something deep within him folded, a surrender he couldn’t resist. He dropped the bundle in the snow and walked back inside, the door closing behind him with a soft, final click that echoed like a lock turning.

He started writing then, to keep the memories sharp and vivid against the encroaching fog. Pages torn from old ledgers scattered across the table, words scrawled by moonlight with a stub of pencil. He wrote about Lydia’s laugh, bright and infectious like sunlight breaking through clouds; the way Mira’s curls smelled after bath time, fresh and sweet with soap; the warmth of their bodies on either side of him in bed on cold nights, a cocoon of safety. But as the nights wore on, the entries shifted subtly. Halfway down a page, his handwriting would change—smaller, neater, the elegant loops Lydia used when jotting recipes or notes. The words weren’t his anymore; they spoke of soil and patience, of feeding what waited below, of roots intertwining and growth in the dark.

He began leaving small gifts, offerings to whatever listened beneath. A lock of his graying hair pressed into a widening crack in the floorboards. A bead of blood from a pricked finger smeared across the windowsill, drying to a rusty stain. Each offering left him lighter, as though grief was being siphoned out drop by drop, replaced with something quieter, older, more elemental.

Storms rolled in and lingered, rain drumming on the roof like impatient fingers tapping a code. Water dripped through new cracks in steady rhythms—one slow and deliberate, one quick and playful, one low and rasping like a whisper from the depths. He named them: Lydia for the slow, Mira for the quick, the guest for the rasping. He talked to the drips for hours, confessing everything he couldn’t say to empty air—the regrets, the what-ifs, the unbearable loneliness. The guest’s voice was patient, encouraging, weaving through the patter. “Love doesn’t end,” it murmured. “It only changes form. You’re almost ready.”

His body began to fail in small, insidious ways. A sour, earthy smell rose from his skin, no matter how he scrubbed. Bruises bloomed under the surface like ink stains, never fading, spreading like vines. His breath grew shallow, labored, but he didn’t feel weak—only purposeful, driven by an inner compulsion. One night, a tooth came loose in his sleep, wobbling free with a coppery taste. He worked it out with his fingers and carried it outside under the moon’s watchful gaze, burying it at the base of the willow. The socket closed over crookedly, but the ache in his heart eased a fraction, as if the offering had balanced some cosmic scale.

He dug in the cellar now, deeper each night, the shovel’s blade slicing through the soft earth like butter. The space below the house was warm and welcoming, the air thick with the scent of loam and hidden life. Every shovelful felt like exhaling something he’d carried too long—anger, sorrow, isolation—leaving room for what came next.

Spring came wrong that year, hesitant and malformed. Snow melted into standing water that pooled in low spots and never quite drained away, turning the fields into a black, glistening mire that sucked at boots and whispered secrets with every step. The ground itself seemed to breathe—slow, rhythmic swells underfoot, as if something vast and ancient turned in its sleep beneath the surface, stirring awake.

Markus spent whole days outside, wandering from spot to spot with the shovel, his movements deliberate and trance-like. He dug small, neat holes and filled them carefully: dead birds that thudded against the windows in increasing numbers, scraps of cloth still carrying Lydia’s faint scent of herbs and sunshine, strips of his own skin peeled away with a paring knife in moments of detached curiosity. The pain was distant, academic, like observing someone else’s suffering. Wounds closed over thick and dark, more scar than skin, textured like bark under his probing fingers.

He barely recognized himself in the cracked mirror hanging crookedly in the hall. His skin had gone gray and papery, stretched thin over sharpened bones, veins black and branching like roots seeking nourishment. Nails hardened and curved into claws. He could go days without water; the morning dew beading on the grass was enough to slake his thirst, cool and vital on his tongue. Food rotted untouched on the table, attracting flies that buzzed in lazy circles. Instead, he’d scoop handfuls of soil from his diggings and taste it—bitter, mineral-rich, full of buried memory. Each swallow brought flashes: Lydia’s hand warm in his as they walked the fields, Mira’s weight balanced on his hip as she pointed at butterflies, the golden warmth of their kitchen on winter evenings, firelight dancing on their faces.

The voices were clear now, layered and constant, no longer confined to scratches or dreams. Lydia sang lullabies in a voice thick with earth, the melodies muffled but achingly familiar. Mira laughed sudden and bright, the sound piercing through the haze like sunlight, the way she used to when he’d swing her high overhead. He spent hours in the nursery, sitting cross-legged on the floor, waiting for small footprints to appear in the thick dust. Sometimes they did—tiny impressions materializing as if by magic, leading toward the door or circling the crib.

One evening, a primal hunger drove him across the field after a thin, skittish deer that had wandered too close. He didn’t remember running, only coming back to himself knee-deep in the sucking mud, blood warm on his mouth and chin, the animal torn open beside him in a frenzy he couldn’t recall. The taste lingered, rich and necessary, metallic and life-affirming. His teeth ached afterward, growing sharper against his probing tongue, points that drew blood if he bit down too hard.

He made larger offerings as the pull grew stronger. A finger joint severed with the shovel’s keen edge, the snap of bone echoing in the quiet. A slice from his thigh, muscle parting with a wet tear. The parts regenerated slowly, wrong—twisted, woody, more plant than flesh. He buried the old pieces gladly, patting the soil smooth over them like tucking in a child for the night.

Pale shoots pushed up where he bled most, slender and insistent, breaking through the earth like tiny fingers reaching for light. They looked almost human in their delicacy, veins of green pulsing faintly. He tended them carefully, watering them with his own blood when rain failed, singing the songs Lydia used to croon while rocking Mira to sleep—soft, soothing melodies that wove through the air like threads.

Grief wasn’t a sharp knife anymore, slicing fresh each day. It had spread through him like roots, thick and patient, anchoring him to the earth. He no longer cried; tears had dried up like old wells. He only listened, and gave, and waited, his existence narrowing to this singular purpose.

A storm finally broke the long, oppressive stillness, rain falling in relentless sheets for days on end, turning the world into a blurred watercolor. The house sweated and groaned under the assault, beams shifting like old bones settling deeper. Water pooled on the uneven floors and ran in rivulets toward the cracks, as if the structure itself yearned to dissolve and return to the earth from whence it came.

The cellar called constantly now, a siren song he couldn’t ignore. Markus descended every night, the candle’s flame barely needed in the growing luminescence below. The hole had expanded into a wide, yawning pit, its walls glistening black with moisture, veined with glowing fungi that pulsed like distant stars. He gave more each time: longer strips of skin peeled away in curling ribbons, chunks of muscle excised with trembling precision, pieces of himself he no longer needed or recognized. Small hands brushed his in the enveloping dark, soft and fleeting. Larger ones guided him deeper, steady and reassuring.

He explored the tunnels that branched out beneath the farmhouse—narrow, winding passages smelling of iron and fresh rain, the air humid and alive. The walls pressed close, almost affectionately, feeding him directly through pores that opened like thirsty mouths. His stomach shrank to nothing, a vestigial organ; his lungs took air only out of lingering habit. Soil filled the hollows inside him where organs had once thrived, rich and dark, sustaining him in ways food never could.

In the deepest chamber, far below the surface, the bones of his wife and daughter waited, wrapped in a cocoon of glowing black roots that throbbed with unnatural vitality. He knelt before them, reverent, and let the earth take what remained—his chest opening gently like a blooming flower, his heart slowing to a final, peaceful stillness, every empty space filled with the embracing dark.

When he climbed back up for the last time, emerging into the dim light of the house, he moved like something assembled from shadow and memory, fluid and otherworldly. His skin hung loose over elongated bones, translucent in places. His eyes shone with a faint, buried light, like embers smoldering in soil. The house welcomed him, its walls pulsing in greeting, the floorboards warming under his feet.

He stood beneath the willow one final evening, the storm abating to a gentle mist. The ground opened softly at his approach, roots curling around his legs like old friends reuniting after long separation. He sank without resistance, arms spreading wide to embrace what waited below, the earth parting like water.

The last thing he felt was Lydia’s hand slipping into his, warm and real, her fingers intertwining with his own.

“Welcome home, love,” she whispered, her voice a caress of soil and stars.

And Markus let the earth close over him, grief finally transformed into something vast, patient, and forever—a union unbroken, roots entwined in the whispering dark. ",3,1766956548.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

Apologies for the poor photos, she dodged cameras like it was an art. She also snuck into the kitchen and ate entire loaves of bread and tubs of butter. Even after we started closing the pantry door, put up baby gates, and put child locks on the fridge and pantry. Still don't know how she did it. She was incredibly smart and could climb ladders. She also liked to rip our fence apart. We had a wooden fence and she would get her mouth around the edge of a board and pull and pull until either the wood snapped in half or the nail was pulled out of the supporting horizontal board and the entire thing came away. We had to nail a lot of boards back to the fence. She loved chewwing and would lay sideways and eat the corners of the walls and our wooden coffee table. Fully swallow and digest eat. Vet said it was fine for her as long as she didn't show distress when going to the bathroom after the first 5 times.

More importantly which has the better shitty mall food and coffee? 

Or any other mall type area good for shopping? I used to live near Sylvia Park, so the only reason I'd prob go there would be for IKEA and their meatballs.

1py2n1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1py2n1a/my_spouse_39m_sees_myself_38f_as_a_reflection_or/,My spouse (39M) sees myself (38F) as a reflection or extension of him,"Over the years, I have come to realize that my spouse must see myself as an extension of him and that is causing a lot of issues…as he is not happy with what he thinks others see. 

For example, I bought a long sleeve shirt and asked if he liked it. He told me it looks like something a person would buy at a bazaar and the one stripe of gray across the middle was “too much gray” and he has decided he doesn’t like gray anymore and is “stepping away from gray.” 

When I scheduled a grocery pickup from Walmart because I didn’t feel like getting groceries that day with a toddler, he had me cancel because “he enjoys walking around the store and I should too.” 

I bought a pair of sunglasses and he asked me if I meant to buy them and that they looked like they were for children because of the rhinestones in the shape of a heart in the corner. He told me to return them immediately. I didn’t. 

I don’t spend much money on myself, I spend it on him, the kids, and the house. He said the way I dress is disrespectful to him and I need to be high maintenance. That I have no style of my own and should get dressing tips from my mother and sister. He gets upset if I buy a shirt from Walmart, even if it is the same quality as one from like TJ Maxx. 

He doesn’t like my long wavy brown hair. He says I need to wear it in different styles every day, and one day he was mad I didn’t straighten it and he told me I look like I have given up on life. He jokes about cutting off all my hair when I am sleeping. 

There has been other little things, like when he started drinking decaffeinated coffee and started putting me down for drinking regular because I prefer the taste. He pressured me for months about this. 

Suffice it to say, I don’t know why he would be so critical of me if he wasn’t worried about how others see me and he must see me as a reflection of him. I’m average looking, I am the same weight I was when we married, and nobody else has ever criticized the way I dress, which is also pretty average...a sweater and jeans right now. I don’t think others see me the way he sees me. 

But it isn’t just this, he also controls how I spend my time and even the way I do things. 

He got angry because I filled the kettle all the way up so that if anyone else wanted hot water it would be ready to go. He said I should only put in one cup if I am making one cup of tea…that I am wasteful and careless and don’t think. 

I wanted to work on a project on my computer on a weekend and he told me I need to put that on hold until his thermostat testing gig was done, that he wanted me to do for him. 

I wanted to hang new blinds and he told me that the priority for him that weekend was installing the doorbells (it was below freezing outside), and that he would keep me company if I would get that done right away. 

One weekend (my weekend is Sunday and Monday) I spent the day catching up on house chores that had fallen behind during the week (he works from home and I am up from 6:45 and get home from work at 6:45 pm so I don’t have much time for chores). He pulls me aside the next day and says from now on, I am not allowed to do chores on Sunday. I have to plan family activities for Sunday and then save chores for Monday. I asked why I can’t do both and will he be joining us? And he said he is “optional” on the Sunday family activities because he is home alone with the kids on Saturday. I said, but on Saturday, you spent two hours or more watching soccer games and you also worked in your office for a few hours too…so why am I not allowed to do other stuff as long as I plan one activity for the kids? He didn’t have anything to say. 

I am getting worn down. When he is stressed out and becomes aggressive toward me, I tell him I understand he is stressed but not to take it out on me. He says I should be more understanding and I need to get tougher. I don’t know how I can get more tough, I don’t cry and I don’t yell or call names, I just tell him what I see. 

I know everyone is different and for some people, controlling their anger is a big struggle. I’ve never been an angry person, so it is hard for me to understand, but I try to be lenient and empathetic to that…but I also don’t want to be an enabler. How do I do this? I also don’t know if what people say when they are angry is just meant to hurt or if it reveals their true thoughts. How do I know? He says he loves me and his actions should speak for him, not his words…but it is hard to separate actions and words…they seem intertwined. ",3,1766956329.0,Marriage,8,1.0,False

Kiko handed him a cup of coffee as he came inside and just leaned against the wall, looking at him.

“What?”

“You didn’t hesitate, you immediately protected them. I'm starting to think you're just a good guy, a real good guy forced to do bad things. I mean, we are so different. I barely trust my boss at the police and you. Im pretty sure you would trust me with your life. It’s… It's scary…”

He tilted his head slightly, looking at her, then took a deep breath, sipped his cup, and put it down.

“I’m not so good, I just have … how to explain it.. something Kerion once said…”

“Please, no naughty facts.” She said with a wink, and Peter chuckled.

“No, naughty, it was about how the rest of the universe views us humans. We are one of the few chaos worlds. It means you never know what you get. The same human can be the most evil person you ever meet and then, in the next turn, sacrifice their life for a child or a stranger on a whim. And if asked, the aliens claim we will make up a perfectly logical reason for such behavior based on complete bullshit. And  I think it makes perfect sense. Yes, we owed those families anything. We should have left, but could you live with it? I could not. They are innocent, and I’m not going to stand by and watch innocents die just because it's easier for me.”

“This is why I’m starting to fall for you. You say these things, and then you act on them.  Okay. What do we do now? We can't stop all the time like this. Dragons, crazy immortal emperor, and desert raiders. How long until we reach the crash site?”

He smiled, picked up his cup, took a sip, then called up the map with the route he had set up. “We are here. The plan was to stop at this column. It would be safer. Maybe we can fly over there tonight and check it out. If it’s safe, then I'll fix it so I can fly from the inside.  We have another ocean to cross, later than the forest and the desert. If we fly on shifts, we can take a few days off and probably fly for 60 hours before we have to stop and let the engine cool down, which will put us in this area along the coastline.”

“I thought you said this trip would take fourteen days. That puts us way past halfway. Maybe a day or two more.”  She noticed and he nodded.

“Yeah, that was before I could sit inside, take breaks when I needed. Now we only have to figure out what to do inside here for the next few days.”

“You're going to tell me everything about yourself. I want to really get to know you. So get ready for an interrogation.”

“So I’m not allowed to interrogate you?” He said, and she just smiled.

“And after that, we are going to start planning.”

“Planning for what?”

“How to take down two criminal empires and ensure no other criminals think about taking over.”

“Well, I know a way, but it's bloody.” He replied, and she just smiled.

“Do tell!”

“Well, you seen it, it’s how you clear a Gyma nest. You kill the bull, and they all attack it, eat it up and then they fight over who is the next bull, it can get mess and a few will die in that process. Once one emerges as a new bull, you kill that one, too. And they fight each other again. You repeat until only a few remain, and then you only have a few to kill instead of going in and having to kill a full nest. The best part is that they are so busy with their own little fights that they don’t go out hunting. Criminals are the same. Kill the leader and wait a few weeks, find out who the new leader is, and kill that one too.  They will all be blaming each other. As long as they have no idea about us and we have no contact with them, then they will not know what hit them.”

“Yeah, that might work, but how do we find out who the new crimelord is if we have no contact with them?” She replied as she pulled up a large file she had with the whole Jangion crime family. He looked at it and made her a cup of coffee and handed it to her.

“Well, we can pick one at random and kill everybody in his way. He will either be the new leader or be killed for trying to take the position. Besides the Gyrran crime families are very public. Their title is public. Big mistake for them, great for us. Thought, are we only going after them?”

“No, but they are the biggest threat to me. After they are dead, I can be rescued and claim that you fought to keep me alive against aliens and monsters. Demanding that you are rewarded and let go. That will work better if I'm pregnant.” She said, and Peter almost spat out his coffee.

“You're crazy. They will claim I took you by force. That this is Stockholm-syndrome, now better I drop you off and vanish, asking in return that they won't hunt me. That will make more sense.”

“It was worth a shot.” She said under her breath, then smiled at him. “Well, it’s a basis for a plan. Something we can work on.”

He just looked at her, and she smiled. “Babies after we're done this, then. Lots of them.”

“Only if you still want me then. I’m old-fashioned, so babies mean marriage, just as you know.”

She looked at him, as her brain tried to understand what he had said, and then she grinned and jumped up into his lap. He had to drop the cup to catch her while she laughed. “YES YES! WHERE'S MY DAMN RING!”

Peter had to promise her to get one as soon as he could.  Now he regretted the whole thing, and she spent the rest of the day sitting on his tummy, interrogating him about everything. It was cute and innocent as she was musing about all he spoke about and how it was different from her life. She loved hearing about his family's farm and the land they owned.  When she found out his uncle bought a plot from his dad to build his house, she suddenly stared at him.

“Build his own house? Not a farm?”

“Yes, it's close to the village, near the spaceport. He works as a doctor. The village has about fifty thousand people, probably more now. It's been a while since I was there.”

“Can we get a house there?” Shed asked eagerly and he chuckled.

“Easy girl. One thing at a time. Besides, I’m pretty sure you want to be closer to a hub.”

“Why,” she stared down at her. “This. Here!  It's the best I’ve ever had. It's weird, but the air is so fresh. I see plants and animals that are not locked up. If we got a dog, could it run free?”  


“Of course, but you know, the pests might make it dangerously. It has to be a big dog, those small city dogs are just snacks out there.” He said as he watched her act like a teenage girl she jumped off him and paced the room.

“And kids? Wait, you survived, so it should not be that bad.  Okay, big dog. I like that. And  lets see. Fenced off right to keep the pest off and autocannon on the roof for the flying pest. Yeah. We need money, so we have to steal some of their assets as well. We have to adjust the plans.  We are not only going to destroy them but also take all their money. We can use it to do good deeds for your planet. We can build a hotel and casino. That way I can have some city life when I absolutely need it, that and a shopping center.  Or a casino resort hotel. We need a few million. We can do this. Then we buy a lot from your parents and have a small tucked-away home just for us.”

He watched her pace the small room as she was making plans for their whole life.

“And if we have such a big place, how will people not find out we own it and try to kidnap our kids for ransom?” He asked, and she stopped for a second to think, then apparently had a great idea.

“We are silent partners. We have some smuck standing in the limelight, and we have some stocks in the company. Enough to keep us from worrying about money. And all in a joint account. 50/50 just to be sure. Oh, by the way, if you find some sidechick, then I will feed her to the gyma, and if I’m so stupid, I expect that you do the same!”

“What? If you're cheating, I’m supposed to feed my side chick to the Gyma? That’s not fair.” He replied, and she looked at him and tackled him.

“IDIOT!” She said and laughed as she rolled over him. “You need to get me a ring. And don’t worry. I might be crazy, but I’m not a cheater.”

The alarm suddenly went off, and they looked at the screen. The adults of the families had climbed up and were laying things down in front of the container.

“I’m going out.” She got up, put on the jacket, a visor, and a mask, and walked out. He looked after her and sight, then grabbed the jacket, belt, vizor, and mask and followed her.",9,1766956288.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

1py2kzr,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1py2kzr/my_boyfriend_has_been_lying_to_me/,My Boyfriend has Been Lying to me,"Hello everyone. My name is Diane Harris. 

I have recently discovered that my entire relationship has been a fabrication. Not the cheeky, ‘haha,’ quirky kind of hiccup. This is a big one. 

I guess I’ll just start off by saying: I am not suicidal. I’ve never thought about harming myself, nor have I been diagnosed with any type of mental illness. 

What I’m about to tell you is my recounting of what I believed to be a healthy, loving relationship. But, as I learned last week, was nothing more than a case of “lonely girl falls into the clutches of a complete and utter psychopath.” 

Derick was 25 when we first met. I had graduated high school a year prior and, I hate to admit, I was more impressionable than I should’ve been. 

When we first laid eyes on each other at that frat party it was like all noise stopped. It was just me and him, completely entranced by one another. 

He stood alone, which I thought was a bit strange. He just sort of hung around the kitchen, fixing himself a drink after we finally broke eye contact. 

I, however, couldn’t stop myself from glancing at him, no matter how hard I tried. 

His curly hair and shadowy beard did wonders for my imagination; so much so that just watching him as he made his drink made my stomach do flip flops. Ah, and his eyes. They were smoldering. A piercing blue that stabbed my heart like an arrow from Cupid himself. 

Terrified to make the first move, it was as though an unspoken prayer was answered when Derick confidently strutted in my direction holding not one, but TWO drinks. 

I’m no idiot. 

I know not to accept drinks from strangers. 

I think my hesitation must’ve been apparent in my face because, once he noticed, he sort of cocked an eyebrow at me and smirked. 

“You think I’m gonna drug you? I don’t drug, sweetie, I chug.” 

Those were his exact words before he took a swig from both glasses and extended one back in my direction. 

“If you’re unconscious, we’re both unconscious. Let’s hope there aren’t any weirdos at this party,” he said with a grin. 

This earned a chuckle out of me, and immediately set my mind at ease. 

We sat together on the sofa and chatted for about an hour before things turned personal. 

My friends approached us, informing me that they would be leaving soon and that if I wanted to do the same, I’d better pack it up with my little “boyfriend.” 

I waved them off, telling them that I’d uber home if need be. They nodded, telling me to text them if I needed anything, and after about half an hour, I couldn’t see them around the party anymore.

Derick started asking me where I grew up, how I ended up at the party, what school I attended, all things that I just thought were normal. 

I explained to him that I grew up in town, was invited to the party by some girlfriends who wanted to help me get over a pretty traumatic breakup, and that I attended the community college at the edge of our county. 

The entire time I spoke, all he did was smile and nod his head. He was an amazing listener, and that only made my attraction for him grow. 

By the time I was finished with all of my personal exposition, he sort of cocked his head back and laced his fingers behind it. 

“Just the way it’s supposed to be, isn’t it?” he murmured. 

I was sure I’d misheard him, so I politely asked him to repeat himself. 

“Just this moment in time, you know. Every decision you’ve ever made has brought you to this moment, here, on this couch with me.” 

His eyes scanned the ceiling as he said this; as though he were searching for meaning in the support beams. 

I’d been in college long enough to understand “weed-speech” so I asked him if he’d been smoking. 

“I don’t smoke. Do you have any idea what that does to your lungs? I mean, I’m sure you do, you look like you were one of the smart kids in class.” 

This comment turned me off a little. It just seemed..I don’t know…dismissive? 

I subtly leaned away from him on the sofa, prompting him to respond in a way that earned my trust back immediately. 

“I didn’t mean that in any kind of ‘assumption’ way, or anything like that. I just meant you articulate yourself well. You give off that vibe, you know? That aura of intelligence.” 

I couldn’t hide my smile or the stars in my eyes that this comment had created, and I know he picked up on it. 

“As I was saying…You and me. Here. On this couch. You don’t think that’s a LITTLE bit cosmically aligned? I mean, you saw me. I saw you. You didn’t reject my drink OR my conversation. Why don’t we see if there’s a spark?” 

“A spark..?” I questioned. “With a drunk guy I met at a frat party? Odds are low, buddy. Odds are real low.” 

I sort of flirtatiously shoved his arm and we shared a little laugh before he responded. 

“Only thing I’m drunk on is loveee, sweetheart. Let’s say we make a toast,” he smirked. 

Fuck it. Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it. 

His eyes teased me. His lips begged me. His slightly drunk body language immersed me. 

“You know what? Fuck it. Let’s see what happens,” I announced before slowly leaning in closer towards him. 

His hand found its way to my cheek and, before I knew it, Derick and I were 15 minutes into a makeout session on some random frat house sofa. 

He began getting a little handsy, but I allowed it on account of me being a bit tipsy myself. 

We were both just so engulfed in the experience; the only thing that snapped us out of it was when a characteristically “frat-bro” voice called out from across the room. 

“Don’t wet your panties on my sofa, girl in the community college hoodie. That goes for you too old guy at the frat party.” 

We pulled away from each other, both embarrassed, and were greeted by what seemed to be every pair of eyes glaring directly into our souls. 

I hated that frat guy. I hated him for how he made us feel in that instant. 

Derick saved us, however, when he cried out, “I swear to GOD….I thought this was my house..” as he drunkenly stumbled to his feet and took me by the hand. 

“C’mon Diane,” he chirped. “Let’s find the right house.” 

I giggled a bit, allowing him to guide me through the crowd of people and out the door. 

At this point, I was definitely feeling the effects of the alcohol as I stumbled down the street, Derick catching me and supporting my flails with a firm grasp. 

I’m not sure when we arrived at his house, but when we did we were almost animalistic. 

It had actually taken me a few months to feel comfortable with a man after what had happened with my ex, but this night, I had completely allowed myself to be free. 

Derick and I kissed sloppily as we tore each other’s clothes off, climbing the stairs without breaking the moment. 

Sex wasn’t non-consensual. I may have been intoxicated, but I knew I wanted it.  And so did Derick. 

After our “hot and bothered” session, we fell asleep in each other’s arms and I had a dreamless night. 

————————-

When I awoke the next morning, Derick snored beside me on his unmade bed, my head throbbed from my hangover, and I felt a deep sense of regret from having slept with a man I’d only met the day prior. 

As quiet as a church mouse, I gathered my belongings and slowly crept out of Derick’s front door, silently praying he wouldn’t wake up and force me into an awkward position. 

Thankfully, that didn’t happen. I simply hailed a cab and did my “walk of shame” directly through my own front door. 

I’d been pretty behind on some school assignments because of a depression that I was only just now coming out of, so I decided that I would use the day as a sort of “catch up” day to ensure I didn’t crash and burn. 

Throwing my headphones on and opening my laptop, I was soon fully immersed in the world of business management and excel. 

I tend to focus pretty hard on studying and assignments when it’s time for it, and because of that fact coupled with the fact that I had Radiohead blaring in my headphones, I could hardly make out the sound of the pounding that came from my front door. 

Surely enough, the knocking cut through my focus eventually, and I begrudgingly walked to my door, ready to tell off whatever salesman or Jehovahs witness that had the audacity to be banging on my door like they were the police. 

I swung the door open and was greeted by…Derick. Standing there. Smile wide as can be with roses in one hand and a box of chocolates in the other. 

I didn’t have time for this. 

“Cliche,” I hissed before attempting to shut the door. 

Dericks foot shot into the crack of my front door, and he plead with all of the sincerity in the world. 

“WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. PLEASE. Just…listen to me for a second. I really liked you, you know? I wasn’t just bluffing to get you into bed last night. You could’ve told me you wanted to leave, I would’ve called you a cab myself. Just give me a sober chance, let’s get to know each other on a normal level rather than a drunk one.”

Opening the door ever so slightly to peek my head at him, I found it hard to resist his clumsy smile, even as a sober woman. 

“Listen, you seem sweet. I love the…enthusiasm… but I’ve got a lot of school work to do. I’ll talk to you la-“ 

Derick cut me off. 

“Dinner tonight. Anywhere you want. I just want to get the chance to know the REAL you. See if there’s a REAL spark; and I want you to want the same for me…” 

I pondered for a moment, staring down at my welcome mat. 

“I don’t want a fancy dinner. Let’s go to the park. We can walk the trails, and MAYBE…you’ll get to dinner eventually.” 

“Done. Absolutely. Now, here,” he plead. “Take these chocolates before they melt, it’s like 90 degrees out here.” 

I did as he asked, and before I could shut the door behind me, he slipped one last question in. 

“Wait, what time should I pick you up?” 

“6. If you’re late you blow it.” 

And with that, he shot me a smile and saluted me cartoonishly before the door finally shut in his face. 

I should’ve recognized that I hadn’t given him my address. I should’ve realized that this man knew where I lived without me saying anything more than “I’m from here in town.” 

Instead, all I felt were butterflies. 

I tried to hide it to his face, but inside I was absolutely melting. 

Not only did he manage to pick my favorite flowers (sunflowers), but he’d also picked the chocolates that were exclusively cherry-filled. 

“Maybe he IS someone special,” I thought to myself, remembering his speech about cosmic alignment. 

Dialing myself back, I returned to my computer until 5:00. I’ll admit, I wanted to look good. Not “try-hard” good, but decent. Feminine, you know? 

I did a bit of makeup and chose some subtly charming earrings that dangled loosely from my earlobes. 

I knew we were gonna be going to the park, so I knew I couldn’t dress TOO casual, and resorted to some Jean shorts and a crop top before dabbing my neck with some givenchy perfume and slipping on my tennis shoes. 

6 o’clock rolled around and the moment it did, 3 light knocks came from my front door. 

I opened it and Derick’s eyes lit up as though he were in the presence of an Angel.  

He told me how beautiful I looked and took me by the hand, guiding me to his vehicle. 

We actually talked…efficiently…on the way to the park. 

He was a sparkling conversationalist and there was never a low point in what we talked about. 

Arriving at the park, we obviously jumped straight into our walk, and the conversation persisted. 

We jumped from topic to topic. He told me about his job in digital security, about his interests, what his plans for the future were, etc. 

Eventually, the conversation moved into the topic of my ex boyfriend. 

At this point, I had already subconsciously began trusting Derick, and felt that sharing some secrets with him wouldn’t hurt. 

“Yeah. He’s…he was definitely not safe,” I muttered, softly. 

“Not safe how?” Derick replied, curious. 

“He just..he did things. Things that I don’t like to talk about.” 

Without missing a beat, Derick replied with, “look, Diane. I know we don’t have that much history, yet, but you can tell me whatever’s on your heart. I’m here to listen. Get to know you, remember?” 

I thought for a moment, dozens of ugly memories flooding my head like a sickness. 

“He hit me a few times. I don’t think he was ever really taught any better. His dad abused his mom, and I think that made him think it was okay. He’s been out of my life for a while, now. I just really wanna put the whole thing behind me. That’s why I’m here with you, Mr Rebound-Guy,” I chuckled. 

Derick didn’t laugh. He didn’t even smirk. Instead, his jaw tightened and his face looked flush as he gritted his teeth. 

“You alright there, bud?” I asked, jokingly. 

He didn’t respond right away, letting silence linger in the air for an uncomfortable amount of time before finally uttering one single sentence. 

“No real man would ever put his hands on a woman like you.” 

He seems to froth at the mouth as he said this, like he was suppressing a deep, deep rage. 

“You mean no real man would ever put hands on a woman period…right?” 

In an instant the color returned to his face and light returned to his eyes as he perked up. 

“Ah, oh, yes, I mean- sorry. That’s not what I meant, I meant I just couldn’t-“ 

I stepped in front of him and placed a hand on his chest. 

“I know what you meant, silly. Don’t worry.” 

He looked relieved at this, and even blushed a little from his apparent internal frustration. 

We went back to walking, and as a little sign of reassurance, I grabbed his hand and held it tightly as we walked together. 

There was some scattered chitchat here and there between the two of us from that point on, but I think we both were mostly just enjoying the embrace and atmosphere. 

Once we reached the end of the trail, we turned around and went straight back from whence we came. 

Approaching his car, I noticed that Derick was…smiling…and trying to hide it. Unfortunately for him, there was no hiding anything from me in this moment. 

“What’s got you grinning over there,” I asked casually. 

He responded in a way that made my heart stop beating and melt all at once. 

“I’m just so happy to be here with you. I’ve really enjoyed this time we’ve had together, and I hope we can do it again sometime. I really like you, Diane.” 

“I’ve enjoyed this time together, too, Derick. And, as much as it PAINS ME TO ADMIT….I think I like you too,” I replied with a slight smile. 

On the car ride home, he nervously asked me if I’d be his girlfriend. And I said yes. 

We arrived back at my house, and I invited him in for a movie and snacks. 

There was no intimacy. He simply let me lay on his lap as we watched inside out 2 and munched on popcorn. 

I ended up falling asleep halfway through the movie, and when I awoke I heard Derick upstairs, shuffling around. 

I wrapped myself in the blanket we’d been using and slowly crept up the stairs to see what he was doing, only for him to pop out from behind the corner at the top and announce, “ITS NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE..you got a bathroom in here anywhere??” Jokingly. 

I pointed him in the direction of the bathroom and when he returned, I let him know that it was getting late and it was probably time for him to start heading home. 

He seemed hesitant, which worried me. But, in the end, he did end up going home. However, not before I finally garnered the sense to ask him how he knew where I lived. 

“You told me, remember? At the party. We were talking about it for like 20 minutes.” 

I thought about that for a moment. I mean, I could’ve. I didn’t really remember a lot from that night other than what I’m recalling here. 

“My address?” I questioned. 

“Well…no…but you did tell me you lived in the blue house on maple street.”

“Derick…every house is blue…” 

“Well, why do you think the chocolates were melting? I had to find your house through sheer willpower, you never even gave me a phone number.” 

That makes sense, right? I mean, after all that he’d done just to get my attention, I didn’t doubt for a second that he’d gone door to door until he found THE door. 
 
Too tired to question him further, I thanked him for a nice night, and sent him on his way, providing him with a nice kiss on the lips to hold him over until we saw each other again. 

The next few months were filled with laughs, love, memories, and a kind of melancholic ache that was brought on by the news of my ex boyfriend’s suicide. 

I hated the man. I, more than anyone, wanted him dead. But I’d still loved him once. There was still that quiet tingling in my brain that made me want to cry thinking about what had happened. 

He’d hung himself in his parent’s garage, leaving a note that blamed nobody but himself. 

It stung. It hurt worse, in my opinion, that I had to find the news out through social media, where his picture circulated across mutual friends accounts who told him to “fly high” and to “rest easy.” 

I cried. I can admit that I cried. And I think that’s when the cracks started forming. 

Derick seemed…annoyed that I was affected. I understand: he was an ex boyfriend who abused me. But, why? Why could I not feel emotion during a time like this. 

His voice grew colder, his smile came less frequently, he seemed personally offended that I had been upset over something he classified as “deserved.” 

At this point, I’d already given 6 months of my time to this man, and my heart belonged to him entirely. 

I’d learned to shrug off his passiveness, his random outbursts, but, our relationship became incredibly rocky when he began punching walls, like a child. 

THAT, I didn’t find cute nor attractive. And I told him that. He’d just look at me with those puppy eyes and apologize with a sincerity I don’t even think Shakespeare could capture. 

I wanted to escape, but he just kept roping me back in with his manipulation and lovebombing. 

Argument? Here’s flowers, but no change. Dericks annoyed? I better be a cushion to his anger, or else I’m the bad guy. I was trapped. 

For months this went on, and my Stockholm syndrome grew more and more with each bout of passive aggression. 

One day, while drunk, Derick let something slip that I’ll never forget. 

He was sitting on the couch, feet propped up on my coffee table, and absolutely out of nowhere, completely unprovoked, he talked not to me, but at me. 

“You know. It’s good that your ex is gone. He’s caused enough tears. Why give him more?” 

I couldn’t do it. 

I decided to stay at my mother’s that night. Leaving my OWN home. 

When I returned, Derick was nowhere to be found. However, a note left on the table informed me that he had gone to the bar and wouldn’t be back till late. 

I couldn’t help but feel relieved at this. I needed it. Desperately. And I slept better that night than I had since, I couldn’t even remember when.

The next few weeks were…awkward…at best. 

A switch in Derick’s mind seemed to had been flipped, and I couldn’t even get more than 2 words out of him at a time. 

My heart was breaking all over again, and I felt utter shame ripple through my body at the realization that I had allowed this to happen. 

I began to rewire my brain, convincing myself that none of this was worthy of my time. Not Derick, not the manipulation, not the lovebombing, none of it. 

As if answered by some bizarre cosmic joke, the line was completely severed last week. 

Derick and I had been living in the same house, but were two distant strangers. My days were spent inside, trying to manage school and sanity. His days were spent doing God knows what. 

On this day in particular, though, he had come home earlier than usual, with a gift in his hands, neatly wrapped and tied with a bow. 

He offered it to me, and I felt my mind break even further. I’d made so much progress, and here he was, attempting to destroy it with his stupid gift giving. 

I told him that I didn’t even want it, but thanked him for thinking about me before turning around and heading towards my bedroom. 

He didn’t say a single word. He just left the gift on the coffee table and was back out the front door before I could notice. 

Time went on and Derick never returned. 

Curiosity began to eat at me. His gifts were always extravagant and meaningful, and the thought of what it could be toyed with me. 

In the late hours of the night, I couldn’t sleep and the curiosity finally broke me as I tip-toed downstairs to take a look at the gift. 

Tied to the bow with a thread of yarn was a handwritten note that I could tell was written by Derick. 

It read, “Diane. I’m sorry for everything. I hope this brings you peace. Do not look for me.” 

This made my curiosity turn morbid, and ever so slowly I began to unwrap the gift. 

Inside, I found a brand new MacBook, still in the box. Along with a single usb stick. 

Connecting the stick to the laptop, a file appeared on screen, simply titled, “For Diane.” 

Within the file, I found hundreds- and I mean hundreds- of screenshots. 

My social media. Pictures from before me and Derick became a thing. Photos of me holding sunflowers, a tweet of mine where I said something along the lines of “wishing someone would get me some cherry-filled chocolates”, snapshots of me and my ex taken from obscure angles. 

More horrifying, were the videos. 

Security footage, dated back before me and Derick even knew each other. Footage of me, at home, studying. Showering. Brushing my teeth. Having “me time,” if you catch my drift. 

I had never felt more sticky and violated, but still, I continued perusing the files contents. 

Buried deep within the screenshots and violations of privacy, I found a longer video. A video with a setting that I recognized only faintly. 

I clicked on it, and was greeted with blurry, pixilated camera footage of what seemed to be a dark, empty room. 

Suddenly, the lights flicked on and I came to the horrifying realization of what I was seeing. 

My ex boyfriend’s garage. 

Muffled shouting could be heard off camera before Derick marched my ex boyfriend into the frame, holding a matte black pistol to the back of his head. 

Without moving the gun, Derick’s head turned towards the camera, and he forced ex boyfriend to speak. 

“Now. Go ahead and tell the camera what we rehearsed,” Derick demanded, waving the gun in my ex boyfriend’s face. 

My ex cried. Tears streamed down his face as he struggled to speak. 

“We don’t have all day, Tyler. Do it.” 

Tyler turned to the camera with empty eyes, and sobbed the words that will haunt my memory forever. 

“I’m doing this for you, Diane.” 

Derick then tossed Tyler a rope. Kicked a chair towards him. And demanded he hang himself. 

Tyler’s wails were soul shattering and terrifying. I could see the will to live in his eyes. The hope on his face that he’d make it out of this. 

Forced into submission, Tyler slowly climbed up on the chair, slipped the rope around his neck, attached it to the garage door track, and mustered one final plea before Derick kicked the chair for him. 

I had to cover my mouth to prevent myself from screaming as Tyler flailed, struggling to breathe as he dangled in the air. 

I didn’t have to watch for long, though, as Derick then took the camera, pointed it directly at himself, and spoke words straight into my heart and mind. 

“He can’t hurt you anymore, honey. He’s the one hurting now. No one will ever hurt you again.” 

The video ended with him laughing this unhinged half-chuckle, half-cry laugh. 

The screen went to black, and I was left alone in a reality that felt like it was coming apart at the seems. 

As I said, this all happened last week. 

The police are now involved, the laptop has been confiscated, and Derick is now a wanted man. 

Don’t ask me where he is. I have no idea. 

All I know, is this man needs to be stopped before this can happen again, and I pray that police catch him while he’s still in the state. 

To Derick: 

Please. Please turn yourself in. Running will only make things worse, and you and I both know the only cosmic alignment you’ll be facing is from the inside of a jail cell. ",0,1766956190.0,creepypasta,1,0.5,False
1py2kox,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1py2kox/my_boyfriend_has_been_lying_to_me/,My Boyfriend has Been Lying to me,"Hello everyone. My name is Diane Harris. 

I have recently discovered that my entire relationship has been a fabrication. Not the cheeky, ‘haha,’ quirky kind of hiccup. This is a big one. 

I guess I’ll just start off by saying: I am not suicidal. I’ve never thought about harming myself, nor have I been diagnosed with any type of mental illness. 

What I’m about to tell you is my recounting of what I believed to be a healthy, loving relationship. But, as I learned last week, was nothing more than a case of “lonely girl falls into the clutches of a complete and utter psychopath.” 

Derick was 25 when we first met. I had graduated high school a year prior and, I hate to admit, I was more impressionable than I should’ve been. 

When we first laid eyes on each other at that frat party it was like all noise stopped. It was just me and him, completely entranced by one another. 

He stood alone, which I thought was a bit strange. He just sort of hung around the kitchen, fixing himself a drink after we finally broke eye contact. 

I, however, couldn’t stop myself from glancing at him, no matter how hard I tried. 

His curly hair and shadowy beard did wonders for my imagination; so much so that just watching him as he made his drink made my stomach do flip flops. Ah, and his eyes. They were smoldering. A piercing blue that stabbed my heart like an arrow from Cupid himself. 

Terrified to make the first move, it was as though an unspoken prayer was answered when Derick confidently strutted in my direction holding not one, but TWO drinks. 

I’m no idiot. 

I know not to accept drinks from strangers. 

I think my hesitation must’ve been apparent in my face because, once he noticed, he sort of cocked an eyebrow at me and smirked. 

“You think I’m gonna drug you? I don’t drug, sweetie, I chug.” 

Those were his exact words before he took a swig from both glasses and extended one back in my direction. 

“If you’re unconscious, we’re both unconscious. Let’s hope there aren’t any weirdos at this party,” he said with a grin. 

This earned a chuckle out of me, and immediately set my mind at ease. 

We sat together on the sofa and chatted for about an hour before things turned personal. 

My friends approached us, informing me that they would be leaving soon and that if I wanted to do the same, I’d better pack it up with my little “boyfriend.” 

I waved them off, telling them that I’d uber home if need be. They nodded, telling me to text them if I needed anything, and after about half an hour, I couldn’t see them around the party anymore.

Derick started asking me where I grew up, how I ended up at the party, what school I attended, all things that I just thought were normal. 

I explained to him that I grew up in town, was invited to the party by some girlfriends who wanted to help me get over a pretty traumatic breakup, and that I attended the community college at the edge of our county. 

The entire time I spoke, all he did was smile and nod his head. He was an amazing listener, and that only made my attraction for him grow. 

By the time I was finished with all of my personal exposition, he sort of cocked his head back and laced his fingers behind it. 

“Just the way it’s supposed to be, isn’t it?” he murmured. 

I was sure I’d misheard him, so I politely asked him to repeat himself. 

“Just this moment in time, you know. Every decision you’ve ever made has brought you to this moment, here, on this couch with me.” 

His eyes scanned the ceiling as he said this; as though he were searching for meaning in the support beams. 

I’d been in college long enough to understand “weed-speech” so I asked him if he’d been smoking. 

“I don’t smoke. Do you have any idea what that does to your lungs? I mean, I’m sure you do, you look like you were one of the smart kids in class.” 

This comment turned me off a little. It just seemed..I don’t know…dismissive? 

I subtly leaned away from him on the sofa, prompting him to respond in a way that earned my trust back immediately. 

“I didn’t mean that in any kind of ‘assumption’ way, or anything like that. I just meant you articulate yourself well. You give off that vibe, you know? That aura of intelligence.” 

I couldn’t hide my smile or the stars in my eyes that this comment had created, and I know he picked up on it. 

“As I was saying…You and me. Here. On this couch. You don’t think that’s a LITTLE bit cosmically aligned? I mean, you saw me. I saw you. You didn’t reject my drink OR my conversation. Why don’t we see if there’s a spark?” 

“A spark..?” I questioned. “With a drunk guy I met at a frat party? Odds are low, buddy. Odds are real low.” 

I sort of flirtatiously shoved his arm and we shared a little laugh before he responded. 

“Only thing I’m drunk on is loveee, sweetheart. Let’s say we make a toast,” he smirked. 

Fuck it. Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it. 

His eyes teased me. His lips begged me. His slightly drunk body language immersed me. 

“You know what? Fuck it. Let’s see what happens,” I announced before slowly leaning in closer towards him. 

His hand found its way to my cheek and, before I knew it, Derick and I were 15 minutes into a makeout session on some random frat house sofa. 

He began getting a little handsy, but I allowed it on account of me being a bit tipsy myself. 

We were both just so engulfed in the experience; the only thing that snapped us out of it was when a characteristically “frat-bro” voice called out from across the room. 

“Don’t wet your panties on my sofa, girl in the community college hoodie. That goes for you too old guy at the frat party.” 

We pulled away from each other, both embarrassed, and were greeted by what seemed to be every pair of eyes glaring directly into our souls. 

I hated that frat guy. I hated him for how he made us feel in that instant. 

Derick saved us, however, when he cried out, “I swear to GOD….I thought this was my house..” as he drunkenly stumbled to his feet and took me by the hand. 

“C’mon Diane,” he chirped. “Let’s find the right house.” 

I giggled a bit, allowing him to guide me through the crowd of people and out the door. 

At this point, I was definitely feeling the effects of the alcohol as I stumbled down the street, Derick catching me and supporting my flails with a firm grasp. 

I’m not sure when we arrived at his house, but when we did we were almost animalistic. 

It had actually taken me a few months to feel comfortable with a man after what had happened with my ex, but this night, I had completely allowed myself to be free. 

Derick and I kissed sloppily as we tore each other’s clothes off, climbing the stairs without breaking the moment. 

Sex wasn’t non-consensual. I may have been intoxicated, but I knew I wanted it.  And so did Derick. 

After our “hot and bothered” session, we fell asleep in each other’s arms and I had a dreamless night. 

————————-

When I awoke the next morning, Derick snored beside me on his unmade bed, my head throbbed from my hangover, and I felt a deep sense of regret from having slept with a man I’d only met the day prior. 

As quiet as a church mouse, I gathered my belongings and slowly crept out of Derick’s front door, silently praying he wouldn’t wake up and force me into an awkward position. 

Thankfully, that didn’t happen. I simply hailed a cab and did my “walk of shame” directly through my own front door. 

I’d been pretty behind on some school assignments because of a depression that I was only just now coming out of, so I decided that I would use the day as a sort of “catch up” day to ensure I didn’t crash and burn. 

Throwing my headphones on and opening my laptop, I was soon fully immersed in the world of business management and excel. 

I tend to focus pretty hard on studying and assignments when it’s time for it, and because of that fact coupled with the fact that I had Radiohead blaring in my headphones, I could hardly make out the sound of the pounding that came from my front door. 

Surely enough, the knocking cut through my focus eventually, and I begrudgingly walked to my door, ready to tell off whatever salesman or Jehovahs witness that had the audacity to be banging on my door like they were the police. 

I swung the door open and was greeted by…Derick. Standing there. Smile wide as can be with roses in one hand and a box of chocolates in the other. 

I didn’t have time for this. 

“Cliche,” I hissed before attempting to shut the door. 

Dericks foot shot into the crack of my front door, and he plead with all of the sincerity in the world. 

“WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. PLEASE. Just…listen to me for a second. I really liked you, you know? I wasn’t just bluffing to get you into bed last night. You could’ve told me you wanted to leave, I would’ve called you a cab myself. Just give me a sober chance, let’s get to know each other on a normal level rather than a drunk one.”

Opening the door ever so slightly to peek my head at him, I found it hard to resist his clumsy smile, even as a sober woman. 

“Listen, you seem sweet. I love the…enthusiasm… but I’ve got a lot of school work to do. I’ll talk to you la-“ 

Derick cut me off. 

“Dinner tonight. Anywhere you want. I just want to get the chance to know the REAL you. See if there’s a REAL spark; and I want you to want the same for me…” 

I pondered for a moment, staring down at my welcome mat. 

“I don’t want a fancy dinner. Let’s go to the park. We can walk the trails, and MAYBE…you’ll get to dinner eventually.” 

“Done. Absolutely. Now, here,” he plead. “Take these chocolates before they melt, it’s like 90 degrees out here.” 

I did as he asked, and before I could shut the door behind me, he slipped one last question in. 

“Wait, what time should I pick you up?” 

“6. If you’re late you blow it.” 

And with that, he shot me a smile and saluted me cartoonishly before the door finally shut in his face. 

I should’ve recognized that I hadn’t given him my address. I should’ve realized that this man knew where I lived without me saying anything more than “I’m from here in town.” 

Instead, all I felt were butterflies. 

I tried to hide it to his face, but inside I was absolutely melting. 

Not only did he manage to pick my favorite flowers (sunflowers), but he’d also picked the chocolates that were exclusively cherry-filled. 

“Maybe he IS someone special,” I thought to myself, remembering his speech about cosmic alignment. 

Dialing myself back, I returned to my computer until 5:00. I’ll admit, I wanted to look good. Not “try-hard” good, but decent. Feminine, you know? 

I did a bit of makeup and chose some subtly charming earrings that dangled loosely from my earlobes. 

I knew we were gonna be going to the park, so I knew I couldn’t dress TOO casual, and resorted to some Jean shorts and a crop top before dabbing my neck with some givenchy perfume and slipping on my tennis shoes. 

6 o’clock rolled around and the moment it did, 3 light knocks came from my front door. 

I opened it and Derick’s eyes lit up as though he were in the presence of an Angel.  

He told me how beautiful I looked and took me by the hand, guiding me to his vehicle. 

We actually talked…efficiently…on the way to the park. 

He was a sparkling conversationalist and there was never a low point in what we talked about. 

Arriving at the park, we obviously jumped straight into our walk, and the conversation persisted. 

We jumped from topic to topic. He told me about his job in digital security, about his interests, what his plans for the future were, etc. 

Eventually, the conversation moved into the topic of my ex boyfriend. 

At this point, I had already subconsciously began trusting Derick, and felt that sharing some secrets with him wouldn’t hurt. 

“Yeah. He’s…he was definitely not safe,” I muttered, softly. 

“Not safe how?” Derick replied, curious. 

“He just..he did things. Things that I don’t like to talk about.” 

Without missing a beat, Derick replied with, “look, Diane. I know we don’t have that much history, yet, but you can tell me whatever’s on your heart. I’m here to listen. Get to know you, remember?” 

I thought for a moment, dozens of ugly memories flooding my head like a sickness. 

“He hit me a few times. I don’t think he was ever really taught any better. His dad abused his mom, and I think that made him think it was okay. He’s been out of my life for a while, now. I just really wanna put the whole thing behind me. That’s why I’m here with you, Mr Rebound-Guy,” I chuckled. 

Derick didn’t laugh. He didn’t even smirk. Instead, his jaw tightened and his face looked flush as he gritted his teeth. 

“You alright there, bud?” I asked, jokingly. 

He didn’t respond right away, letting silence linger in the air for an uncomfortable amount of time before finally uttering one single sentence. 

“No real man would ever put his hands on a woman like you.” 

He seems to froth at the mouth as he said this, like he was suppressing a deep, deep rage. 

“You mean no real man would ever put hands on a woman period…right?” 

In an instant the color returned to his face and light returned to his eyes as he perked up. 

“Ah, oh, yes, I mean- sorry. That’s not what I meant, I meant I just couldn’t-“ 

I stepped in front of him and placed a hand on his chest. 

“I know what you meant, silly. Don’t worry.” 

He looked relieved at this, and even blushed a little from his apparent internal frustration. 

We went back to walking, and as a little sign of reassurance, I grabbed his hand and held it tightly as we walked together. 

There was some scattered chitchat here and there between the two of us from that point on, but I think we both were mostly just enjoying the embrace and atmosphere.

“I’ve enjoyed this time together, too, Derick. And, as much as it PAINS ME TO ADMIT….I think I like you too,” I replied with a slight smile. 

On the car ride home, he nervously asked me if I’d be his girlfriend. And I said yes. 

We arrived back at my house, and I invited him in for a movie and snacks. 

There was no intimacy. He simply let me lay on his lap as we watched inside out 2 and munched on popcorn. 

I ended up falling asleep halfway through the movie, and when I awoke I heard Derick upstairs, shuffling around. 

I wrapped myself in the blanket we’d been using and slowly crept up the stairs to see what he was doing, only for him to pop out from behind the corner at the top and announce, “ITS NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE..you got a bathroom in here anywhere??” Jokingly.

I wanted to escape, but he just kept roping me back in with his manipulation and lovebombing. 

Argument? Here’s flowers, but no change. Dericks annoyed? I better be a cushion to his anger, or else I’m the bad guy. I was trapped. 

For months this went on, and my Stockholm syndrome grew more and more with each bout of passive aggression.

The next few weeks were…awkward…at best. 

A switch in Derick’s mind seemed to had been flipped, and I couldn’t even get more than 2 words out of him at a time. 

My heart was breaking all over again, and I felt utter shame ripple through my body at the realization that I had allowed this to happen. 

I began to rewire my brain, convincing myself that none of this was worthy of my time. Not Derick, not the manipulation, not the lovebombing, none of it. 

As if answered by some bizarre cosmic joke, the line was completely severed last week. 

Derick and I had been living in the same house, but were two distant strangers. My days were spent inside, trying to manage school and sanity. His days were spent doing God knows what. 

On this day in particular, though, he had come home earlier than usual, with a gift in his hands, neatly wrapped and tied with a bow. 

He offered it to me, and I felt my mind break even further. I’d made so much progress, and here he was, attempting to destroy it with his stupid gift giving. 

I told him that I didn’t even want it, but thanked him for thinking about me before turning around and heading towards my bedroom. 

He didn’t say a single word. He just left the gift on the coffee table and was back out the front door before I could notice. 

Time went on and Derick never returned. 

Curiosity began to eat at me. His gifts were always extravagant and meaningful, and the thought of what it could be toyed with me. 

In the late hours of the night, I couldn’t sleep and the curiosity finally broke me as I tip-toed downstairs to take a look at the gift. 

Tied to the bow with a thread of yarn was a handwritten note that I could tell was written by Derick. 

It read, “Diane. I’m sorry for everything. I hope this brings you peace. Do not look for me.” 

This made my curiosity turn morbid, and ever so slowly I began to unwrap the gift. 

Inside, I found a brand new MacBook, still in the box. Along with a single usb stick. 

Connecting the stick to the laptop, a file appeared on screen, simply titled, “For Diane.” 

Within the file, I found hundreds- and I mean hundreds- of screenshots. 

My social media. Pictures from before me and Derick became a thing. Photos of me holding sunflowers, a tweet of mine where I said something along the lines of “wishing someone would get me some cherry-filled chocolates”, snapshots of me and my ex taken from obscure angles. 

More horrifying, were the videos. 

Security footage, dated back before me and Derick even knew each other. Footage of me, at home, studying. Showering. Brushing my teeth. Having “me time,” if you catch my drift. 

I had never felt more sticky and violated, but still, I continued perusing the files contents. 

Buried deep within the screenshots and violations of privacy, I found a longer video. A video with a setting that I recognized only faintly. 

I clicked on it, and was greeted with blurry, pixilated camera footage of what seemed to be a dark, empty room. 

Suddenly, the lights flicked on and I came to the horrifying realization of what I was seeing. 

My ex boyfriend’s garage. 

Muffled shouting could be heard off camera before Derick marched my ex boyfriend into the frame, holding a matte black pistol to the back of his head. 

Without moving the gun, Derick’s head turned towards the camera, and he forced ex boyfriend to speak. 

“Now. Go ahead and tell the camera what we rehearsed,” Derick demanded, waving the gun in my ex boyfriend’s face. 

My ex cried. Tears streamed down his face as he struggled to speak. 

“We don’t have all day, Tyler. Do it.” 

Tyler turned to the camera with empty eyes, and sobbed the words that will haunt my memory forever. 

“I’m doing this for you, Diane.” 

Derick then tossed Tyler a rope. Kicked a chair towards him. And demanded he hang himself. 

Tyler’s wails were soul shattering and terrifying. I could see the will to live in his eyes. The hope on his face that he’d make it out of this. 

Forced into submission, Tyler slowly climbed up on the chair, slipped the rope around his neck, attached it to the garage door track, and mustered one final plea before Derick kicked the chair for him. 

I had to cover my mouth to prevent myself from screaming as Tyler flailed, struggling to breathe as he dangled in the air. 

I didn’t have to watch for long, though, as Derick then took the camera, pointed it directly at himself, and spoke words straight into my heart and mind. 

“He can’t hurt you anymore, honey. He’s the one hurting now. No one will ever hurt you again.” 

The video ended with him laughing this unhinged half-chuckle, half-cry laugh. 

The screen went to black, and I was left alone in a reality that felt like it was coming apart at the seems. 

As I said, this all happened last week. 

The police are now involved, the laptop has been confiscated, and Derick is now a wanted man. 

Don’t ask me where he is. I have no idea. 

All I know, is this man needs to be stopped before this can happen again, and I pray that police catch him while he’s still in the state. 

To Derick: 

Please. Please turn yourself in. Running will only make things worse, and you and I both know the only cosmic alignment you’ll be facing is from the inside of a jail cell. ",3,1766956170.0,stories,2,0.8,False
1py2kek,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1py2kek/my_boyfriend_has_been_lying_to_me/,My Boyfriend has Been Lying to me,"Hello everyone. My name is Diane Harris. 

I have recently discovered that my entire relationship has been a fabrication. Not the cheeky, ‘haha,’ quirky kind of hiccup. This is a big one. 

I guess I’ll just start off by saying: I am not suicidal. I’ve never thought about harming myself, nor have I been diagnosed with any type of mental illness. 

What I’m about to tell you is my recounting of what I believed to be a healthy, loving relationship. But, as I learned last week, was nothing more than a case of “lonely girl falls into the clutches of a complete and utter psychopath.” 

Derick was 25 when we first met. I had graduated high school a year prior and, I hate to admit, I was more impressionable than I should’ve been. 

When we first laid eyes on each other at that frat party it was like all noise stopped. It was just me and him, completely entranced by one another. 

He stood alone, which I thought was a bit strange. He just sort of hung around the kitchen, fixing himself a drink after we finally broke eye contact. 

I, however, couldn’t stop myself from glancing at him, no matter how hard I tried. 

His curly hair and shadowy beard did wonders for my imagination; so much so that just watching him as he made his drink made my stomach do flip flops. Ah, and his eyes. They were smoldering. A piercing blue that stabbed my heart like an arrow from Cupid himself. 

Terrified to make the first move, it was as though an unspoken prayer was answered when Derick confidently strutted in my direction holding not one, but TWO drinks. 

I’m no idiot. 

I know not to accept drinks from strangers. 

I think my hesitation must’ve been apparent in my face because, once he noticed, he sort of cocked an eyebrow at me and smirked. 

“You think I’m gonna drug you? I don’t drug, sweetie, I chug.” 

Those were his exact words before he took a swig from both glasses and extended one back in my direction. 

“If you’re unconscious, we’re both unconscious. Let’s hope there aren’t any weirdos at this party,” he said with a grin. 

This earned a chuckle out of me, and immediately set my mind at ease. 

We sat together on the sofa and chatted for about an hour before things turned personal. 

My friends approached us, informing me that they would be leaving soon and that if I wanted to do the same, I’d better pack it up with my little “boyfriend.” 

I waved them off, telling them that I’d uber home if need be. They nodded, telling me to text them if I needed anything, and after about half an hour, I couldn’t see them around the party anymore.

Derick started asking me where I grew up, how I ended up at the party, what school I attended, all things that I just thought were normal. 

I explained to him that I grew up in town, was invited to the party by some girlfriends who wanted to help me get over a pretty traumatic breakup, and that I attended the community college at the edge of our county. 

The entire time I spoke, all he did was smile and nod his head. He was an amazing listener, and that only made my attraction for him grow. 

By the time I was finished with all of my personal exposition, he sort of cocked his head back and laced his fingers behind it. 

“Just the way it’s supposed to be, isn’t it?” he murmured. 

I was sure I’d misheard him, so I politely asked him to repeat himself. 

“Just this moment in time, you know. Every decision you’ve ever made has brought you to this moment, here, on this couch with me.” 

His eyes scanned the ceiling as he said this; as though he were searching for meaning in the support beams. 

I’d been in college long enough to understand “weed-speech” so I asked him if he’d been smoking. 

“I don’t smoke. Do you have any idea what that does to your lungs? I mean, I’m sure you do, you look like you were one of the smart kids in class.” 

This comment turned me off a little. It just seemed..I don’t know…dismissive? 

I subtly leaned away from him on the sofa, prompting him to respond in a way that earned my trust back immediately. 

“I didn’t mean that in any kind of ‘assumption’ way, or anything like that. I just meant you articulate yourself well. You give off that vibe, you know? That aura of intelligence.” 

I couldn’t hide my smile or the stars in my eyes that this comment had created, and I know he picked up on it. 

“As I was saying…You and me. Here. On this couch. You don’t think that’s a LITTLE bit cosmically aligned? I mean, you saw me. I saw you. You didn’t reject my drink OR my conversation. Why don’t we see if there’s a spark?” 

“A spark..?” I questioned. “With a drunk guy I met at a frat party? Odds are low, buddy. Odds are real low.” 

I sort of flirtatiously shoved his arm and we shared a little laugh before he responded. 

“Only thing I’m drunk on is loveee, sweetheart. Let’s say we make a toast,” he smirked. 

Fuck it. Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it. 

His eyes teased me. His lips begged me. His slightly drunk body language immersed me. 

“You know what? Fuck it. Let’s see what happens,” I announced before slowly leaning in closer towards him. 

His hand found its way to my cheek and, before I knew it, Derick and I were 15 minutes into a makeout session on some random frat house sofa. 

He began getting a little handsy, but I allowed it on account of me being a bit tipsy myself. 

We were both just so engulfed in the experience; the only thing that snapped us out of it was when a characteristically “frat-bro” voice called out from across the room. 

“Don’t wet your panties on my sofa, girl in the community college hoodie. That goes for you too old guy at the frat party.” 

We pulled away from each other, both embarrassed, and were greeted by what seemed to be every pair of eyes glaring directly into our souls. 

I hated that frat guy. I hated him for how he made us feel in that instant. 

Derick saved us, however, when he cried out, “I swear to GOD….I thought this was my house..” as he drunkenly stumbled to his feet and took me by the hand. 

“C’mon Diane,” he chirped. “Let’s find the right house.” 

I giggled a bit, allowing him to guide me through the crowd of people and out the door. 

At this point, I was definitely feeling the effects of the alcohol as I stumbled down the street, Derick catching me and supporting my flails with a firm grasp. 

I’m not sure when we arrived at his house, but when we did we were almost animalistic. 

It had actually taken me a few months to feel comfortable with a man after what had happened with my ex, but this night, I had completely allowed myself to be free. 

Derick and I kissed sloppily as we tore each other’s clothes off, climbing the stairs without breaking the moment. 

Sex wasn’t non-consensual. I may have been intoxicated, but I knew I wanted it.  And so did Derick. 

After our “hot and bothered” session, we fell asleep in each other’s arms and I had a dreamless night. 

————————-

When I awoke the next morning, Derick snored beside me on his unmade bed, my head throbbed from my hangover, and I felt a deep sense of regret from having slept with a man I’d only met the day prior. 

As quiet as a church mouse, I gathered my belongings and slowly crept out of Derick’s front door, silently praying he wouldn’t wake up and force me into an awkward position. 

Thankfully, that didn’t happen. I simply hailed a cab and did my “walk of shame” directly through my own front door. 

I’d been pretty behind on some school assignments because of a depression that I was only just now coming out of, so I decided that I would use the day as a sort of “catch up” day to ensure I didn’t crash and burn. 

Throwing my headphones on and opening my laptop, I was soon fully immersed in the world of business management and excel. 

I tend to focus pretty hard on studying and assignments when it’s time for it, and because of that fact coupled with the fact that I had Radiohead blaring in my headphones, I could hardly make out the sound of the pounding that came from my front door. 

Surely enough, the knocking cut through my focus eventually, and I begrudgingly walked to my door, ready to tell off whatever salesman or Jehovahs witness that had the audacity to be banging on my door like they were the police. 

I swung the door open and was greeted by…Derick. Standing there. Smile wide as can be with roses in one hand and a box of chocolates in the other. 

I didn’t have time for this. 

“Cliche,” I hissed before attempting to shut the door. 

Dericks foot shot into the crack of my front door, and he plead with all of the sincerity in the world. 

“WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. PLEASE. Just…listen to me for a second. I really liked you, you know? I wasn’t just bluffing to get you into bed last night. You could’ve told me you wanted to leave, I would’ve called you a cab myself. Just give me a sober chance, let’s get to know each other on a normal level rather than a drunk one.”

Opening the door ever so slightly to peek my head at him, I found it hard to resist his clumsy smile, even as a sober woman. 

“Listen, you seem sweet. I love the…enthusiasm… but I’ve got a lot of school work to do. I’ll talk to you la-“ 

Derick cut me off. 

“Dinner tonight. Anywhere you want. I just want to get the chance to know the REAL you. See if there’s a REAL spark; and I want you to want the same for me…” 

I pondered for a moment, staring down at my welcome mat. 

“I don’t want a fancy dinner. Let’s go to the park. We can walk the trails, and MAYBE…you’ll get to dinner eventually.” 

“Done. Absolutely. Now, here,” he plead. “Take these chocolates before they melt, it’s like 90 degrees out here.” 

I did as he asked, and before I could shut the door behind me, he slipped one last question in. 

“Wait, what time should I pick you up?” 

“6. If you’re late you blow it.” 

And with that, he shot me a smile and saluted me cartoonishly before the door finally shut in his face. 

I should’ve recognized that I hadn’t given him my address. I should’ve realized that this man knew where I lived without me saying anything more than “I’m from here in town.” 

Instead, all I felt were butterflies. 

I tried to hide it to his face, but inside I was absolutely melting. 

Not only did he manage to pick my favorite flowers (sunflowers), but he’d also picked the chocolates that were exclusively cherry-filled. 

“Maybe he IS someone special,” I thought to myself, remembering his speech about cosmic alignment. 

Dialing myself back, I returned to my computer until 5:00. I’ll admit, I wanted to look good. Not “try-hard” good, but decent. Feminine, you know? 

I did a bit of makeup and chose some subtly charming earrings that dangled loosely from my earlobes. 

I knew we were gonna be going to the park, so I knew I couldn’t dress TOO casual, and resorted to some Jean shorts and a crop top before dabbing my neck with some givenchy perfume and slipping on my tennis shoes. 

6 o’clock rolled around and the moment it did, 3 light knocks came from my front door. 

I opened it and Derick’s eyes lit up as though he were in the presence of an Angel.  

He told me how beautiful I looked and took me by the hand, guiding me to his vehicle. 

We actually talked…efficiently…on the way to the park. 

He was a sparkling conversationalist and there was never a low point in what we talked about. 

Arriving at the park, we obviously jumped straight into our walk, and the conversation persisted. 

We jumped from topic to topic. He told me about his job in digital security, about his interests, what his plans for the future were, etc. 

Eventually, the conversation moved into the topic of my ex boyfriend. 

At this point, I had already subconsciously began trusting Derick, and felt that sharing some secrets with him wouldn’t hurt. 

“Yeah. He’s…he was definitely not safe,” I muttered, softly. 

“Not safe how?” Derick replied, curious. 

“He just..he did things. Things that I don’t like to talk about.” 

Without missing a beat, Derick replied with, “look, Diane. I know we don’t have that much history, yet, but you can tell me whatever’s on your heart. I’m here to listen. Get to know you, remember?” 

I thought for a moment, dozens of ugly memories flooding my head like a sickness. 

“He hit me a few times. I don’t think he was ever really taught any better. His dad abused his mom, and I think that made him think it was okay. He’s been out of my life for a while, now. I just really wanna put the whole thing behind me. That’s why I’m here with you, Mr Rebound-Guy,” I chuckled. 

Derick didn’t laugh. He didn’t even smirk. Instead, his jaw tightened and his face looked flush as he gritted his teeth. 

“You alright there, bud?” I asked, jokingly. 

He didn’t respond right away, letting silence linger in the air for an uncomfortable amount of time before finally uttering one single sentence. 

“No real man would ever put his hands on a woman like you.” 

He seems to froth at the mouth as he said this, like he was suppressing a deep, deep rage. 

“You mean no real man would ever put hands on a woman period…right?” 

In an instant the color returned to his face and light returned to his eyes as he perked up. 

“Ah, oh, yes, I mean- sorry. That’s not what I meant, I meant I just couldn’t-“ 

I stepped in front of him and placed a hand on his chest. 

“I know what you meant, silly. Don’t worry.” 

He looked relieved at this, and even blushed a little from his apparent internal frustration. 

We went back to walking, and as a little sign of reassurance, I grabbed his hand and held it tightly as we walked together. 

There was some scattered chitchat here and there between the two of us from that point on, but I think we both were mostly just enjoying the embrace and atmosphere. 

Once we reached the end of the trail, we turned around and went straight back from whence we came. 

Approaching his car, I noticed that Derick was…smiling…and trying to hide it. Unfortunately for him, there was no hiding anything from me in this moment. 

“What’s got you grinning over there,” I asked casually. 

He responded in a way that made my heart stop beating and melt all at once. 

“I’m just so happy to be here with you. I’ve really enjoyed this time we’ve had together, and I hope we can do it again sometime. I really like you, Diane.” 

“I’ve enjoyed this time together, too, Derick. And, as much as it PAINS ME TO ADMIT….I think I like you too,” I replied with a slight smile. 

On the car ride home, he nervously asked me if I’d be his girlfriend. And I said yes. 

We arrived back at my house, and I invited him in for a movie and snacks. 

There was no intimacy. He simply let me lay on his lap as we watched inside out 2 and munched on popcorn. 

I ended up falling asleep halfway through the movie, and when I awoke I heard Derick upstairs, shuffling around. 

I wrapped myself in the blanket we’d been using and slowly crept up the stairs to see what he was doing, only for him to pop out from behind the corner at the top and announce, “ITS NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE..you got a bathroom in here anywhere??” Jokingly. 

I pointed him in the direction of the bathroom and when he returned, I let him know that it was getting late and it was probably time for him to start heading home. 

He seemed hesitant, which worried me. But, in the end, he did end up going home. However, not before I finally garnered the sense to ask him how he knew where I lived. 

“You told me, remember? At the party. We were talking about it for like 20 minutes.” 

I thought about that for a moment. I mean, I could’ve. I didn’t really remember a lot from that night other than what I’m recalling here. 

“My address?” I questioned. 

“Well…no…but you did tell me you lived in the blue house on maple street.”

“Derick…every house is blue…” 

“Well, why do you think the chocolates were melting? I had to find your house through sheer willpower, you never even gave me a phone number.” 

That makes sense, right? I mean, after all that he’d done just to get my attention, I didn’t doubt for a second that he’d gone door to door until he found THE door. 
 
Too tired to question him further, I thanked him for a nice night, and sent him on his way, providing him with a nice kiss on the lips to hold him over until we saw each other again. 

The next few months were filled with laughs, love, memories, and a kind of melancholic ache that was brought on by the news of my ex boyfriend’s suicide. 

I hated the man. I, more than anyone, wanted him dead. But I’d still loved him once. There was still that quiet tingling in my brain that made me want to cry thinking about what had happened. 

He’d hung himself in his parent’s garage, leaving a note that blamed nobody but himself. 

It stung. It hurt worse, in my opinion, that I had to find the news out through social media, where his picture circulated across mutual friends accounts who told him to “fly high” and to “rest easy.” 

I cried. I can admit that I cried. And I think that’s when the cracks started forming. 

Derick seemed…annoyed that I was affected. I understand: he was an ex boyfriend who abused me. But, why? Why could I not feel emotion during a time like this. 

His voice grew colder, his smile came less frequently, he seemed personally offended that I had been upset over something he classified as “deserved.” 

At this point, I’d already given 6 months of my time to this man, and my heart belonged to him entirely. 

I’d learned to shrug off his passiveness, his random outbursts, but, our relationship became incredibly rocky when he began punching walls, like a child. 

THAT, I didn’t find cute nor attractive. And I told him that. He’d just look at me with those puppy eyes and apologize with a sincerity I don’t even think Shakespeare could capture. 

I wanted to escape, but he just kept roping me back in with his manipulation and lovebombing. 

Argument? Here’s flowers, but no change. Dericks annoyed? I better be a cushion to his anger, or else I’m the bad guy. I was trapped. 

For months this went on, and my Stockholm syndrome grew more and more with each bout of passive aggression. 

One day, while drunk, Derick let something slip that I’ll never forget. 

He was sitting on the couch, feet propped up on my coffee table, and absolutely out of nowhere, completely unprovoked, he talked not to me, but at me. 

“You know. It’s good that your ex is gone. He’s caused enough tears. Why give him more?” 

I couldn’t do it. 

I decided to stay at my mother’s that night. Leaving my OWN home. 

When I returned, Derick was nowhere to be found. However, a note left on the table informed me that he had gone to the bar and wouldn’t be back till late. 

I couldn’t help but feel relieved at this. I needed it. Desperately. And I slept better that night than I had since, I couldn’t even remember when.

The next few weeks were…awkward…at best. 

A switch in Derick’s mind seemed to had been flipped, and I couldn’t even get more than 2 words out of him at a time. 

My heart was breaking all over again, and I felt utter shame ripple through my body at the realization that I had allowed this to happen. 

I began to rewire my brain, convincing myself that none of this was worthy of my time. Not Derick, not the manipulation, not the lovebombing, none of it.

What I’m about to tell you is my recounting of what I believed to be a healthy, loving relationship. But, as I learned last week, was nothing more than a case of “lonely girl falls into the clutches of a complete and utter psychopath.” 

Derick was 25 when we first met. I had graduated high school a year prior and, I hate to admit, I was more impressionable than I should’ve been. 

When we first laid eyes on each other at that frat party it was like all noise stopped. It was just me and him, completely entranced by one another. 

He stood alone, which I thought was a bit strange. He just sort of hung around the kitchen, fixing himself a drink after we finally broke eye contact. 

I, however, couldn’t stop myself from glancing at him, no matter how hard I tried. 

His curly hair and shadowy beard did wonders for my imagination; so much so that just watching him as he made his drink made my stomach do flip flops. Ah, and his eyes. They were smoldering. A piercing blue that stabbed my heart like an arrow from Cupid himself. 

Terrified to make the first move, it was as though an unspoken prayer was answered when Derick confidently strutted in my direction holding not one, but TWO drinks. 

I’m no idiot. 

I know not to accept drinks from strangers. 

I think my hesitation must’ve been apparent in my face because, once he noticed, he sort of cocked an eyebrow at me and smirked. 

“You think I’m gonna drug you? I don’t drug, sweetie, I chug.” 

Those were his exact words before he took a swig from both glasses and extended one back in my direction. 

“If you’re unconscious, we’re both unconscious. Let’s hope there aren’t any weirdos at this party,” he said with a grin. 

This earned a chuckle out of me, and immediately set my mind at ease. 

We sat together on the sofa and chatted for about an hour before things turned personal. 

My friends approached us, informing me that they would be leaving soon and that if I wanted to do the same, I’d better pack it up with my little “boyfriend.” 

I waved them off, telling them that I’d uber home if need be. They nodded, telling me to text them if I needed anything, and after about half an hour, I couldn’t see them around the party anymore.

Derick started asking me where I grew up, how I ended up at the party, what school I attended, all things that I just thought were normal. 

I explained to him that I grew up in town, was invited to the party by some girlfriends who wanted to help me get over a pretty traumatic breakup, and that I attended the community college at the edge of our county. 

The entire time I spoke, all he did was smile and nod his head. He was an amazing listener, and that only made my attraction for him grow. 

By the time I was finished with all of my personal exposition, he sort of cocked his head back and laced his fingers behind it. 

“Just the way it’s supposed to be, isn’t it?” he murmured. 

I was sure I’d misheard him, so I politely asked him to repeat himself. 

“Just this moment in time, you know. Every decision you’ve ever made has brought you to this moment, here, on this couch with me.” 

His eyes scanned the ceiling as he said this; as though he were searching for meaning in the support beams. 

I’d been in college long enough to understand “weed-speech” so I asked him if he’d been smoking. 

“I don’t smoke. Do you have any idea what that does to your lungs? I mean, I’m sure you do, you look like you were one of the smart kids in class.” 

This comment turned me off a little. It just seemed..I don’t know…dismissive? 

I subtly leaned away from him on the sofa, prompting him to respond in a way that earned my trust back immediately. 

“I didn’t mean that in any kind of ‘assumption’ way, or anything like that. I just meant you articulate yourself well. You give off that vibe, you know? That aura of intelligence.” 

I couldn’t hide my smile or the stars in my eyes that this comment had created, and I know he picked up on it. 

“As I was saying…You and me. Here. On this couch. You don’t think that’s a LITTLE bit cosmically aligned? I mean, you saw me. I saw you. You didn’t reject my drink OR my conversation. Why don’t we see if there’s a spark?” 

“A spark..?” I questioned. “With a drunk guy I met at a frat party? Odds are low, buddy. Odds are real low.” 

I sort of flirtatiously shoved his arm and we shared a little laugh before he responded. 

“Only thing I’m drunk on is loveee, sweetheart. Let’s say we make a toast,” he smirked. 

Fuck it. Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it. 

His eyes teased me. His lips begged me. His slightly drunk body language immersed me. 

“You know what? Fuck it. Let’s see what happens,” I announced before slowly leaning in closer towards him. 

His hand found its way to my cheek and, before I knew it, Derick and I were 15 minutes into a makeout session on some random frat house sofa. 

He began getting a little handsy, but I allowed it on account of me being a bit tipsy myself. 

We were both just so engulfed in the experience; the only thing that snapped us out of it was when a characteristically “frat-bro” voice called out from across the room. 

“Don’t wet your panties on my sofa, girl in the community college hoodie. That goes for you too old guy at the frat party.” 

We pulled away from each other, both embarrassed, and were greeted by what seemed to be every pair of eyes glaring directly into our souls. 

I hated that frat guy. I hated him for how he made us feel in that instant. 

Derick saved us, however, when he cried out, “I swear to GOD….I thought this was my house..” as he drunkenly stumbled to his feet and took me by the hand. 

“C’mon Diane,” he chirped. “Let’s find the right house.” 

I giggled a bit, allowing him to guide me through the crowd of people and out the door. 

At this point, I was definitely feeling the effects of the alcohol as I stumbled down the street, Derick catching me and supporting my flails with a firm grasp. 

I’m not sure when we arrived at his house, but when we did we were almost animalistic. 

It had actually taken me a few months to feel comfortable with a man after what had happened with my ex, but this night, I had completely allowed myself to be free. 

Derick and I kissed sloppily as we tore each other’s clothes off, climbing the stairs without breaking the moment. 

Sex wasn’t non-consensual. I may have been intoxicated, but I knew I wanted it.  And so did Derick. 

After our “hot and bothered” session, we fell asleep in each other’s arms and I had a dreamless night. 

————————-

When I awoke the next morning, Derick snored beside me on his unmade bed, my head throbbed from my hangover, and I felt a deep sense of regret from having slept with a man I’d only met the day prior. 

As quiet as a church mouse, I gathered my belongings and slowly crept out of Derick’s front door, silently praying he wouldn’t wake up and force me into an awkward position. 

Thankfully, that didn’t happen. I simply hailed a cab and did my “walk of shame” directly through my own front door. 

I’d been pretty behind on some school assignments because of a depression that I was only just now coming out of, so I decided that I would use the day as a sort of “catch up” day to ensure I didn’t crash and burn. 

Throwing my headphones on and opening my laptop, I was soon fully immersed in the world of business management and excel. 

I tend to focus pretty hard on studying and assignments when it’s time for it, and because of that fact coupled with the fact that I had Radiohead blaring in my headphones, I could hardly make out the sound of the pounding that came from my front door. 

Surely enough, the knocking cut through my focus eventually, and I begrudgingly walked to my door, ready to tell off whatever salesman or Jehovahs witness that had the audacity to be banging on my door like they were the police. 

I swung the door open and was greeted by…Derick. Standing there. Smile wide as can be with roses in one hand and a box of chocolates in the other. 

I didn’t have time for this. 

“Cliche,” I hissed before attempting to shut the door. 

Dericks foot shot into the crack of my front door, and he plead with all of the sincerity in the world. 

“WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. PLEASE. Just…listen to me for a second. I really liked you, you know? I wasn’t just bluffing to get you into bed last night. You could’ve told me you wanted to leave, I would’ve called you a cab myself. Just give me a sober chance, let’s get to know each other on a normal level rather than a drunk one.”

Opening the door ever so slightly to peek my head at him, I found it hard to resist his clumsy smile, even as a sober woman. 

“Listen, you seem sweet. I love the…enthusiasm… but I’ve got a lot of school work to do. I’ll talk to you la-“ 

Derick cut me off. 

“Dinner tonight. Anywhere you want. I just want to get the chance to know the REAL you. See if there’s a REAL spark; and I want you to want the same for me…” 

I pondered for a moment, staring down at my welcome mat. 

“I don’t want a fancy dinner. Let’s go to the park. We can walk the trails, and MAYBE…you’ll get to dinner eventually.” 

“Done. Absolutely. Now, here,” he plead. “Take these chocolates before they melt, it’s like 90 degrees out here.” 

I did as he asked, and before I could shut the door behind me, he slipped one last question in. 

“Wait, what time should I pick you up?” 

“6. If you’re late you blow it.” 

And with that, he shot me a smile and saluted me cartoonishly before the door finally shut in his face. 

I should’ve recognized that I hadn’t given him my address. I should’ve realized that this man knew where I lived without me saying anything more than “I’m from here in town.” 

Instead, all I felt were butterflies. 

I tried to hide it to his face, but inside I was absolutely melting. 

Not only did he manage to pick my favorite flowers (sunflowers), but he’d also picked the chocolates that were exclusively cherry-filled. 

“Maybe he IS someone special,” I thought to myself, remembering his speech about cosmic alignment. 

Dialing myself back, I returned to my computer until 5:00. I’ll admit, I wanted to look good. Not “try-hard” good, but decent. Feminine, you know? 

I did a bit of makeup and chose some subtly charming earrings that dangled loosely from my earlobes. 

I knew we were gonna be going to the park, so I knew I couldn’t dress TOO casual, and resorted to some Jean shorts and a crop top before dabbing my neck with some givenchy perfume and slipping on my tennis shoes. 

6 o’clock rolled around and the moment it did, 3 light knocks came from my front door. 

I opened it and Derick’s eyes lit up as though he were in the presence of an Angel.  

He told me how beautiful I looked and took me by the hand, guiding me to his vehicle. 

We actually talked…efficiently…on the way to the park. 

He was a sparkling conversationalist and there was never a low point in what we talked about. 

Arriving at the park, we obviously jumped straight into our walk, and the conversation persisted. 

We jumped from topic to topic. He told me about his job in digital security, about his interests, what his plans for the future were, etc. 

Eventually, the conversation moved into the topic of my ex boyfriend. 

At this point, I had already subconsciously began trusting Derick, and felt that sharing some secrets with him wouldn’t hurt. 

“Yeah. He’s…he was definitely not safe,” I muttered, softly. 

“Not safe how?” Derick replied, curious. 

“He just..he did things. Things that I don’t like to talk about.” 

Without missing a beat, Derick replied with, “look, Diane. I know we don’t have that much history, yet, but you can tell me whatever’s on your heart. I’m here to listen. Get to know you, remember?” 

I thought for a moment, dozens of ugly memories flooding my head like a sickness. 

“He hit me a few times. I don’t think he was ever really taught any better. His dad abused his mom, and I think that made him think it was okay. He’s been out of my life for a while, now. I just really wanna put the whole thing behind me. That’s why I’m here with you, Mr Rebound-Guy,” I chuckled. 

Derick didn’t laugh. He didn’t even smirk. Instead, his jaw tightened and his face looked flush as he gritted his teeth. 

“You alright there, bud?” I asked, jokingly. 

He didn’t respond right away, letting silence linger in the air for an uncomfortable amount of time before finally uttering one single sentence. 

“No real man would ever put his hands on a woman like you.” 

He seems to froth at the mouth as he said this, like he was suppressing a deep, deep rage. 

“You mean no real man would ever put hands on a woman period…right?” 

In an instant the color returned to his face and light returned to his eyes as he perked up. 

“Ah, oh, yes, I mean- sorry. That’s not what I meant, I meant I just couldn’t-“ 

I stepped in front of him and placed a hand on his chest. 

“I know what you meant, silly. Don’t worry.” 

He looked relieved at this, and even blushed a little from his apparent internal frustration. 

We went back to walking, and as a little sign of reassurance, I grabbed his hand and held it tightly as we walked together. 

There was some scattered chitchat here and there between the two of us from that point on, but I think we both were mostly just enjoying the embrace and atmosphere. 

Once we reached the end of the trail, we turned around and went straight back from whence we came. 

Approaching his car, I noticed that Derick was…smiling…and trying to hide it. Unfortunately for him, there was no hiding anything from me in this moment. 

“What’s got you grinning over there,” I asked casually. 

He responded in a way that made my heart stop beating and melt all at once. 

“I’m just so happy to be here with you. I’ve really enjoyed this time we’ve had together, and I hope we can do it again sometime. I really like you, Diane.” 

“I’ve enjoyed this time together, too, Derick. And, as much as it PAINS ME TO ADMIT….I think I like you too,” I replied with a slight smile. 

On the car ride home, he nervously asked me if I’d be his girlfriend. And I said yes. 

We arrived back at my house, and I invited him in for a movie and snacks. 

There was no intimacy. He simply let me lay on his lap as we watched inside out 2 and munched on popcorn. 

I ended up falling asleep halfway through the movie, and when I awoke I heard Derick upstairs, shuffling around. 

I wrapped myself in the blanket we’d been using and slowly crept up the stairs to see what he was doing, only for him to pop out from behind the corner at the top and announce, “ITS NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE..you got a bathroom in here anywhere??” Jokingly. 

I pointed him in the direction of the bathroom and when he returned, I let him know that it was getting late and it was probably time for him to start heading home. 

He seemed hesitant, which worried me. But, in the end, he did end up going home. However, not before I finally garnered the sense to ask him how he knew where I lived. 

“You told me, remember? At the party. We were talking about it for like 20 minutes.” 

I thought about that for a moment. I mean, I could’ve. I didn’t really remember a lot from that night other than what I’m recalling here. 

“My address?” I questioned. 

“Well…no…but you did tell me you lived in the blue house on maple street.”

“Derick…every house is blue…” 

“Well, why do you think the chocolates were melting? I had to find your house through sheer willpower, you never even gave me a phone number.” 

That makes sense, right? I mean, after all that he’d done just to get my attention, I didn’t doubt for a second that he’d gone door to door until he found THE door. 
 
Too tired to question him further, I thanked him for a nice night, and sent him on his way, providing him with a nice kiss on the lips to hold him over until we saw each other again. 

The next few months were filled with laughs, love, memories, and a kind of melancholic ache that was brought on by the news of my ex boyfriend’s suicide. 

I hated the man. I, more than anyone, wanted him dead. But I’d still loved him once. There was still that quiet tingling in my brain that made me want to cry thinking about what had happened. 

He’d hung himself in his parent’s garage, leaving a note that blamed nobody but himself. 

It stung. It hurt worse, in my opinion, that I had to find the news out through social media, where his picture circulated across mutual friends accounts who told him to “fly high” and to “rest easy.” 

I cried. I can admit that I cried. And I think that’s when the cracks started forming. 

Derick seemed…annoyed that I was affected. I understand: he was an ex boyfriend who abused me. But, why? Why could I not feel emotion during a time like this. 

His voice grew colder, his smile came less frequently, he seemed personally offended that I had been upset over something he classified as “deserved.” 

At this point, I’d already given 6 months of my time to this man, and my heart belonged to him entirely. 

I’d learned to shrug off his passiveness, his random outbursts, but, our relationship became incredibly rocky when he began punching walls, like a child. 

THAT, I didn’t find cute nor attractive. And I told him that. He’d just look at me with those puppy eyes and apologize with a sincerity I don’t even think Shakespeare could capture. 

I wanted to escape, but he just kept roping me back in with his manipulation and lovebombing. 

Argument? Here’s flowers, but no change. Dericks annoyed? I better be a cushion to his anger, or else I’m the bad guy. I was trapped. 

For months this went on, and my Stockholm syndrome grew more and more with each bout of passive aggression. 

One day, while drunk, Derick let something slip that I’ll never forget. 

He was sitting on the couch, feet propped up on my coffee table, and absolutely out of nowhere, completely unprovoked, he talked not to me, but at me. 

“You know. It’s good that your ex is gone. He’s caused enough tears. Why give him more?” 

I couldn’t do it. 

I decided to stay at my mother’s that night. Leaving my OWN home. 

When I returned, Derick was nowhere to be found. However, a note left on the table informed me that he had gone to the bar and wouldn’t be back till late. 

I couldn’t help but feel relieved at this. I needed it. Desperately. And I slept better that night than I had since, I couldn’t even remember when.

The next few weeks were…awkward…at best. 

A switch in Derick’s mind seemed to had been flipped, and I couldn’t even get more than 2 words out of him at a time. 

My heart was breaking all over again, and I felt utter shame ripple through my body at the realization that I had allowed this to happen. 

I began to rewire my brain, convincing myself that none of this was worthy of my time. Not Derick, not the manipulation, not the lovebombing, none of it. 

As if answered by some bizarre cosmic joke, the line was completely severed last week. 

Derick and I had been living in the same house, but were two distant strangers. My days were spent inside, trying to manage school and sanity. His days were spent doing God knows what. 

On this day in particular, though, he had come home earlier than usual, with a gift in his hands, neatly wrapped and tied with a bow. 

He offered it to me, and I felt my mind break even further. I’d made so much progress, and here he was, attempting to destroy it with his stupid gift giving. 

I told him that I didn’t even want it, but thanked him for thinking about me before turning around and heading towards my bedroom. 

He didn’t say a single word. He just left the gift on the coffee table and was back out the front door before I could notice. 

Time went on and Derick never returned. 

Curiosity began to eat at me. His gifts were always extravagant and meaningful, and the thought of what it could be toyed with me. 

In the late hours of the night, I couldn’t sleep and the curiosity finally broke me as I tip-toed downstairs to take a look at the gift. 

Tied to the bow with a thread of yarn was a handwritten note that I could tell was written by Derick. 

It read, “Diane. I’m sorry for everything. I hope this brings you peace. Do not look for me.” 

This made my curiosity turn morbid, and ever so slowly I began to unwrap the gift. 

Inside, I found a brand new MacBook, still in the box. Along with a single usb stick. 

Connecting the stick to the laptop, a file appeared on screen, simply titled, “For Diane.” 

Within the file, I found hundreds- and I mean hundreds- of screenshots. 

My social media. Pictures from before me and Derick became a thing. Photos of me holding sunflowers, a tweet of mine where I said something along the lines of “wishing someone would get me some cherry-filled chocolates”, snapshots of me and my ex taken from obscure angles. 

More horrifying, were the videos. 

Security footage, dated back before me and Derick even knew each other. Footage of me, at home, studying. Showering. Brushing my teeth. Having “me time,” if you catch my drift. 

I had never felt more sticky and violated, but still, I continued perusing the files contents. 

Buried deep within the screenshots and violations of privacy, I found a longer video. A video with a setting that I recognized only faintly. 

I clicked on it, and was greeted with blurry, pixilated camera footage of what seemed to be a dark, empty room. 

Suddenly, the lights flicked on and I came to the horrifying realization of what I was seeing. 

My ex boyfriend’s garage. 

Muffled shouting could be heard off camera before Derick marched my ex boyfriend into the frame, holding a matte black pistol to the back of his head. 

Without moving the gun, Derick’s head turned towards the camera, and he forced ex boyfriend to speak. 

“Now. Go ahead and tell the camera what we rehearsed,” Derick demanded, waving the gun in my ex boyfriend’s face. 

My ex cried. Tears streamed down his face as he struggled to speak. 

“We don’t have all day, Tyler. Do it.” 

Tyler turned to the camera with empty eyes, and sobbed the words that will haunt my memory forever. 

“I’m doing this for you, Diane.” 

Derick then tossed Tyler a rope. Kicked a chair towards him. And demanded he hang himself. 

Tyler’s wails were soul shattering and terrifying. I could see the will to live in his eyes. The hope on his face that he’d make it out of this. 

Forced into submission, Tyler slowly climbed up on the chair, slipped the rope around his neck, attached it to the garage door track, and mustered one final plea before Derick kicked the chair for him. 

I had to cover my mouth to prevent myself from screaming as Tyler flailed, struggling to breathe as he dangled in the air. 

I didn’t have to watch for long, though, as Derick then took the camera, pointed it directly at himself, and spoke words straight into my heart and mind. 

“He can’t hurt you anymore, honey. He’s the one hurting now. No one will ever hurt you again.” 

The video ended with him laughing this unhinged half-chuckle, half-cry laugh. 

The screen went to black, and I was left alone in a reality that felt like it was coming apart at the seems. 

As I said, this all happened last week. 

The police are now involved, the laptop has been confiscated, and Derick is now a wanted man. 

Don’t ask me where he is. I have no idea. 

All I know, is this man needs to be stopped before this can happen again, and I pray that police catch him while he’s still in the state. 

To Derick: 

Please. Please turn yourself in. Running will only make things worse, and you and I both know the only cosmic alignment you’ll be facing is from the inside of a jail cell. ",2,1766956128.0,horrorstories,2,0.75,False

1py2jui,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1py2jui/my_boyfriend_has_been_lying_to_me/,My Boyfriend has Been Lying to me,"Hello everyone. My name is Diane Harris. 

I have recently discovered that my entire relationship has been a fabrication. Not the cheeky, ‘haha,’ quirky kind of hiccup. This is a big one. 

I guess I’ll just start off by saying: I am not suicidal. I’ve never thought about harming myself, nor have I been diagnosed with any type of mental illness. 

What I’m about to tell you is my recounting of what I believed to be a healthy, loving relationship. But, as I learned last week, was nothing more than a case of “lonely girl falls into the clutches of a complete and utter psychopath.” 

Derick was 25 when we first met. I had graduated high school a year prior and, I hate to admit, I was more impressionable than I should’ve been. 

When we first laid eyes on each other at that frat party it was like all noise stopped. It was just me and him, completely entranced by one another. 

He stood alone, which I thought was a bit strange. He just sort of hung around the kitchen, fixing himself a drink after we finally broke eye contact. 

I, however, couldn’t stop myself from glancing at him, no matter how hard I tried. 

His curly hair and shadowy beard did wonders for my imagination; so much so that just watching him as he made his drink made my stomach do flip flops. Ah, and his eyes. They were smoldering. A piercing blue that stabbed my heart like an arrow from Cupid himself. 

Terrified to make the first move, it was as though an unspoken prayer was answered when Derick confidently strutted in my direction holding not one, but TWO drinks. 

I’m no idiot. 

I know not to accept drinks from strangers. 

I think my hesitation must’ve been apparent in my face because, once he noticed, he sort of cocked an eyebrow at me and smirked. 

“You think I’m gonna drug you? I don’t drug, sweetie, I chug.” 

Those were his exact words before he took a swig from both glasses and extended one back in my direction. 

“If you’re unconscious, we’re both unconscious. Let’s hope there aren’t any weirdos at this party,” he said with a grin. 

This earned a chuckle out of me, and immediately set my mind at ease. 

We sat together on the sofa and chatted for about an hour before things turned personal. 

My friends approached us, informing me that they would be leaving soon and that if I wanted to do the same, I’d better pack it up with my little “boyfriend.” 

I waved them off, telling them that I’d uber home if need be. They nodded, telling me to text them if I needed anything, and after about half an hour, I couldn’t see them around the party anymore.

Derick started asking me where I grew up, how I ended up at the party, what school I attended, all things that I just thought were normal. 

I explained to him that I grew up in town, was invited to the party by some girlfriends who wanted to help me get over a pretty traumatic breakup, and that I attended the community college at the edge of our county. 

The entire time I spoke, all he did was smile and nod his head. He was an amazing listener, and that only made my attraction for him grow. 

By the time I was finished with all of my personal exposition, he sort of cocked his head back and laced his fingers behind it. 

“Just the way it’s supposed to be, isn’t it?” he murmured. 

I was sure I’d misheard him, so I politely asked him to repeat himself. 

“Just this moment in time, you know. Every decision you’ve ever made has brought you to this moment, here, on this couch with me.” 

His eyes scanned the ceiling as he said this; as though he were searching for meaning in the support beams. 

I’d been in college long enough to understand “weed-speech” so I asked him if he’d been smoking. 

“I don’t smoke. Do you have any idea what that does to your lungs? I mean, I’m sure you do, you look like you were one of the smart kids in class.” 

This comment turned me off a little. It just seemed..I don’t know…dismissive? 

I subtly leaned away from him on the sofa, prompting him to respond in a way that earned my trust back immediately. 

“I didn’t mean that in any kind of ‘assumption’ way, or anything like that. I just meant you articulate yourself well. You give off that vibe, you know? That aura of intelligence.” 

I couldn’t hide my smile or the stars in my eyes that this comment had created, and I know he picked up on it. 

“As I was saying…You and me. Here. On this couch. You don’t think that’s a LITTLE bit cosmically aligned? I mean, you saw me. I saw you. You didn’t reject my drink OR my conversation. Why don’t we see if there’s a spark?” 

“A spark..?” I questioned. “With a drunk guy I met at a frat party? Odds are low, buddy. Odds are real low.” 

I sort of flirtatiously shoved his arm and we shared a little laugh before he responded. 

“Only thing I’m drunk on is loveee, sweetheart. Let’s say we make a toast,” he smirked. 

Fuck it. Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it. 

His eyes teased me. His lips begged me. His slightly drunk body language immersed me. 

“You know what? Fuck it. Let’s see what happens,” I announced before slowly leaning in closer towards him. 

His hand found its way to my cheek and, before I knew it, Derick and I were 15 minutes into a makeout session on some random frat house sofa. 

He began getting a little handsy, but I allowed it on account of me being a bit tipsy myself. 

We were both just so engulfed in the experience; the only thing that snapped us out of it was when a characteristically “frat-bro” voice called out from across the room. 

“Don’t wet your panties on my sofa, girl in the community college hoodie. That goes for you too old guy at the frat party.” 

We pulled away from each other, both embarrassed, and were greeted by what seemed to be every pair of eyes glaring directly into our souls. 

I hated that frat guy. I hated him for how he made us feel in that instant. 

Derick saved us, however, when he cried out, “I swear to GOD….I thought this was my house..” as he drunkenly stumbled to his feet and took me by the hand. 

“C’mon Diane,” he chirped. “Let’s find the right house.” 

I giggled a bit, allowing him to guide me through the crowd of people and out the door. 

At this point, I was definitely feeling the effects of the alcohol as I stumbled down the street, Derick catching me and supporting my flails with a firm grasp. 

I’m not sure when we arrived at his house, but when we did we were almost animalistic. 

It had actually taken me a few months to feel comfortable with a man after what had happened with my ex, but this night, I had completely allowed myself to be free. 

Derick and I kissed sloppily as we tore each other’s clothes off, climbing the stairs without breaking the moment. 

Sex wasn’t non-consensual. I may have been intoxicated, but I knew I wanted it.  And so did Derick. 

After our “hot and bothered” session, we fell asleep in each other’s arms and I had a dreamless night. 

————————-

When I awoke the next morning, Derick snored beside me on his unmade bed, my head throbbed from my hangover, and I felt a deep sense of regret from having slept with a man I’d only met the day prior. 

As quiet as a church mouse, I gathered my belongings and slowly crept out of Derick’s front door, silently praying he wouldn’t wake up and force me into an awkward position. 

Thankfully, that didn’t happen. I simply hailed a cab and did my “walk of shame” directly through my own front door. 

I’d been pretty behind on some school assignments because of a depression that I was only just now coming out of, so I decided that I would use the day as a sort of “catch up” day to ensure I didn’t crash and burn. 

Throwing my headphones on and opening my laptop, I was soon fully immersed in the world of business management and excel. 

I tend to focus pretty hard on studying and assignments when it’s time for it, and because of that fact coupled with the fact that I had Radiohead blaring in my headphones, I could hardly make out the sound of the pounding that came from my front door. 

Surely enough, the knocking cut through my focus eventually, and I begrudgingly walked to my door, ready to tell off whatever salesman or Jehovahs witness that had the audacity to be banging on my door like they were the police. 

I swung the door open and was greeted by…Derick. Standing there. Smile wide as can be with roses in one hand and a box of chocolates in the other. 

I didn’t have time for this. 

“Cliche,” I hissed before attempting to shut the door. 

Dericks foot shot into the crack of my front door, and he plead with all of the sincerity in the world. 

“WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. PLEASE. Just…listen to me for a second. I really liked you, you know? I wasn’t just bluffing to get you into bed last night. You could’ve told me you wanted to leave, I would’ve called you a cab myself. Just give me a sober chance, let’s get to know each other on a normal level rather than a drunk one.”

Opening the door ever so slightly to peek my head at him, I found it hard to resist his clumsy smile, even as a sober woman. 

“Listen, you seem sweet. I love the…enthusiasm… but I’ve got a lot of school work to do. I’ll talk to you la-“ 

Derick cut me off. 

“Dinner tonight. Anywhere you want. I just want to get the chance to know the REAL you. See if there’s a REAL spark; and I want you to want the same for me…” 

I pondered for a moment, staring down at my welcome mat. 

“I don’t want a fancy dinner. Let’s go to the park. We can walk the trails, and MAYBE…you’ll get to dinner eventually.” 

“Done. Absolutely. Now, here,” he plead. “Take these chocolates before they melt, it’s like 90 degrees out here.” 

I did as he asked, and before I could shut the door behind me, he slipped one last question in. 

“Wait, what time should I pick you up?” 

“6. If you’re late you blow it.” 

And with that, he shot me a smile and saluted me cartoonishly before the door finally shut in his face. 

I should’ve recognized that I hadn’t given him my address. I should’ve realized that this man knew where I lived without me saying anything more than “I’m from here in town.” 

Instead, all I felt were butterflies. 

I tried to hide it to his face, but inside I was absolutely melting. 

Not only did he manage to pick my favorite flowers (sunflowers), but he’d also picked the chocolates that were exclusively cherry-filled. 

“Maybe he IS someone special,” I thought to myself, remembering his speech about cosmic alignment. 

Dialing myself back, I returned to my computer until 5:00. I’ll admit, I wanted to look good. Not “try-hard” good, but decent. Feminine, you know? 

I did a bit of makeup and chose some subtly charming earrings that dangled loosely from my earlobes. 

I knew we were gonna be going to the park, so I knew I couldn’t dress TOO casual, and resorted to some Jean shorts and a crop top before dabbing my neck with some givenchy perfume and slipping on my tennis shoes. 

6 o’clock rolled around and the moment it did, 3 light knocks came from my front door. 

I opened it and Derick’s eyes lit up as though he were in the presence of an Angel.  

He told me how beautiful I looked and took me by the hand, guiding me to his vehicle. 

We actually talked…efficiently…on the way to the park. 

He was a sparkling conversationalist and there was never a low point in what we talked about. 

Arriving at the park, we obviously jumped straight into our walk, and the conversation persisted. 

We jumped from topic to topic. He told me about his job in digital security, about his interests, what his plans for the future were, etc. 

Eventually, the conversation moved into the topic of my ex boyfriend. 

At this point, I had already subconsciously began trusting Derick, and felt that sharing some secrets with him wouldn’t hurt. 

“Yeah. He’s…he was definitely not safe,” I muttered, softly. 

“Not safe how?” Derick replied, curious. 

“He just..he did things. Things that I don’t like to talk about.” 

Without missing a beat, Derick replied with, “look, Diane. I know we don’t have that much history, yet, but you can tell me whatever’s on your heart. I’m here to listen. Get to know you, remember?” 

I thought for a moment, dozens of ugly memories flooding my head like a sickness. 

“He hit me a few times. I don’t think he was ever really taught any better. His dad abused his mom, and I think that made him think it was okay. He’s been out of my life for a while, now. I just really wanna put the whole thing behind me. That’s why I’m here with you, Mr Rebound-Guy,” I chuckled. 

Derick didn’t laugh. He didn’t even smirk. Instead, his jaw tightened and his face looked flush as he gritted his teeth. 

“You alright there, bud?” I asked, jokingly. 

He didn’t respond right away, letting silence linger in the air for an uncomfortable amount of time before finally uttering one single sentence. 

“No real man would ever put his hands on a woman like you.” 

He seems to froth at the mouth as he said this, like he was suppressing a deep, deep rage. 

“You mean no real man would ever put hands on a woman period…right?” 

In an instant the color returned to his face and light returned to his eyes as he perked up. 

“Ah, oh, yes, I mean- sorry. That’s not what I meant, I meant I just couldn’t-“ 

I stepped in front of him and placed a hand on his chest. 

“I know what you meant, silly. Don’t worry.” 

He looked relieved at this, and even blushed a little from his apparent internal frustration. 

We went back to walking, and as a little sign of reassurance, I grabbed his hand and held it tightly as we walked together. 

There was some scattered chitchat here and there between the two of us from that point on, but I think we both were mostly just enjoying the embrace and atmosphere. 

Once we reached the end of the trail, we turned around and went straight back from whence we came. 

Approaching his car, I noticed that Derick was…smiling…and trying to hide it. Unfortunately for him, there was no hiding anything from me in this moment. 

“What’s got you grinning over there,” I asked casually. 

He responded in a way that made my heart stop beating and melt all at once. 

“I’m just so happy to be here with you. I’ve really enjoyed this time we’ve had together, and I hope we can do it again sometime. I really like you, Diane.” 

“I’ve enjoyed this time together, too, Derick. And, as much as it PAINS ME TO ADMIT….I think I like you too,” I replied with a slight smile. 

On the car ride home, he nervously asked me if I’d be his girlfriend. And I said yes. 

We arrived back at my house, and I invited him in for a movie and snacks. 

There was no intimacy. He simply let me lay on his lap as we watched inside out 2 and munched on popcorn. 

I ended up falling asleep halfway through the movie, and when I awoke I heard Derick upstairs, shuffling around. 

I wrapped myself in the blanket we’d been using and slowly crept up the stairs to see what he was doing, only for him to pop out from behind the corner at the top and announce, “ITS NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE..you got a bathroom in here anywhere??” Jokingly. 

I pointed him in the direction of the bathroom and when he returned, I let him know that it was getting late and it was probably time for him to start heading home. 

He seemed hesitant, which worried me. But, in the end, he did end up going home. However, not before I finally garnered the sense to ask him how he knew where I lived. 

“You told me, remember? At the party. We were talking about it for like 20 minutes.” 

I thought about that for a moment. I mean, I could’ve. I didn’t really remember a lot from that night other than what I’m recalling here. 

“My address?” I questioned. 

“Well…no…but you did tell me you lived in the blue house on maple street.”

“Derick…every house is blue…” 

“Well, why do you think the chocolates were melting? I had to find your house through sheer willpower, you never even gave me a phone number.” 

That makes sense, right? I mean, after all that he’d done just to get my attention, I didn’t doubt for a second that he’d gone door to door until he found THE door. 
 
Too tired to question him further, I thanked him for a nice night, and sent him on his way, providing him with a nice kiss on the lips to hold him over until we saw each other again. 

The next few months were filled with laughs, love, memories, and a kind of melancholic ache that was brought on by the news of my ex boyfriend’s suicide. 

I hated the man. I, more than anyone, wanted him dead. But I’d still loved him once. There was still that quiet tingling in my brain that made me want to cry thinking about what had happened. 

He’d hung himself in his parent’s garage, leaving a note that blamed nobody but himself. 

It stung. It hurt worse, in my opinion, that I had to find the news out through social media, where his picture circulated across mutual friends accounts who told him to “fly high” and to “rest easy.” 

I cried. I can admit that I cried. And I think that’s when the cracks started forming. 

Derick seemed…annoyed that I was affected. I understand: he was an ex boyfriend who abused me. But, why? Why could I not feel emotion during a time like this. 

His voice grew colder, his smile came less frequently, he seemed personally offended that I had been upset over something he classified as “deserved.” 

At this point, I’d already given 6 months of my time to this man, and my heart belonged to him entirely. 

I’d learned to shrug off his passiveness, his random outbursts, but, our relationship became incredibly rocky when he began punching walls, like a child. 

THAT, I didn’t find cute nor attractive. And I told him that. He’d just look at me with those puppy eyes and apologize with a sincerity I don’t even think Shakespeare could capture. 

I wanted to escape, but he just kept roping me back in with his manipulation and lovebombing. 

Argument? Here’s flowers, but no change. Dericks annoyed? I better be a cushion to his anger, or else I’m the bad guy. I was trapped. 

For months this went on, and my Stockholm syndrome grew more and more with each bout of passive aggression. 

One day, while drunk, Derick let something slip that I’ll never forget. 

He was sitting on the couch, feet propped up on my coffee table, and absolutely out of nowhere, completely unprovoked, he talked not to me, but at me. 

“You know. It’s good that your ex is gone. He’s caused enough tears. Why give him more?” 

I couldn’t do it. 

I decided to stay at my mother’s that night. Leaving my OWN home. 

When I returned, Derick was nowhere to be found. However, a note left on the table informed me that he had gone to the bar and wouldn’t be back till late. 

I couldn’t help but feel relieved at this. I needed it. Desperately. And I slept better that night than I had since, I couldn’t even remember when.

The next few weeks were…awkward…at best. 

A switch in Derick’s mind seemed to had been flipped, and I couldn’t even get more than 2 words out of him at a time. 

My heart was breaking all over again, and I felt utter shame ripple through my body at the realization that I had allowed this to happen. 

I began to rewire my brain, convincing myself that none of this was worthy of my time. Not Derick, not the manipulation, not the lovebombing, none of it. 

As if answered by some bizarre cosmic joke, the line was completely severed last week. 

Derick and I had been living in the same house, but were two distant strangers. My days were spent inside, trying to manage school and sanity. His days were spent doing God knows what. 

On this day in particular, though, he had come home earlier than usual, with a gift in his hands, neatly wrapped and tied with a bow. 

He offered it to me, and I felt my mind break even further. I’d made so much progress, and here he was, attempting to destroy it with his stupid gift giving. 

I told him that I didn’t even want it, but thanked him for thinking about me before turning around and heading towards my bedroom. 

He didn’t say a single word. He just left the gift on the coffee table and was back out the front door before I could notice. 

Time went on and Derick never returned. 

Curiosity began to eat at me. His gifts were always extravagant and meaningful, and the thought of what it could be toyed with me. 

In the late hours of the night, I couldn’t sleep and the curiosity finally broke me as I tip-toed downstairs to take a look at the gift. 

Tied to the bow with a thread of yarn was a handwritten note that I could tell was written by Derick. 

It read, “Diane. I’m sorry for everything. I hope this brings you peace. Do not look for me.” 

This made my curiosity turn morbid, and ever so slowly I began to unwrap the gift. 

Inside, I found a brand new MacBook, still in the box. Along with a single usb stick. 

Connecting the stick to the laptop, a file appeared on screen, simply titled, “For Diane.” 

Within the file, I found hundreds- and I mean hundreds- of screenshots. 

My social media. Pictures from before me and Derick became a thing. Photos of me holding sunflowers, a tweet of mine where I said something along the lines of “wishing someone would get me some cherry-filled chocolates”, snapshots of me and my ex taken from obscure angles. 

More horrifying, were the videos. 

Security footage, dated back before me and Derick even knew each other. Footage of me, at home, studying. Showering. Brushing my teeth. Having “me time,” if you catch my drift. 

I had never felt more sticky and violated, but still, I continued perusing the files contents. 

Buried deep within the screenshots and violations of privacy, I found a longer video. A video with a setting that I recognized only faintly. 

I clicked on it, and was greeted with blurry, pixilated camera footage of what seemed to be a dark, empty room. 

Suddenly, the lights flicked on and I came to the horrifying realization of what I was seeing. 

My ex boyfriend’s garage. 

Muffled shouting could be heard off camera before Derick marched my ex boyfriend into the frame, holding a matte black pistol to the back of his head. 

Without moving the gun, Derick’s head turned towards the camera, and he forced ex boyfriend to speak. 

“Now. Go ahead and tell the camera what we rehearsed,” Derick demanded, waving the gun in my ex boyfriend’s face. 

My ex cried. Tears streamed down his face as he struggled to speak. 

“We don’t have all day, Tyler. Do it.” 

Tyler turned to the camera with empty eyes, and sobbed the words that will haunt my memory forever. 

“I’m doing this for you, Diane.” 

Derick then tossed Tyler a rope. Kicked a chair towards him. And demanded he hang himself. 

Tyler’s wails were soul shattering and terrifying. I could see the will to live in his eyes. The hope on his face that he’d make it out of this. 

Forced into submission, Tyler slowly climbed up on the chair, slipped the rope around his neck, attached it to the garage door track, and mustered one final plea before Derick kicked the chair for him. 

I had to cover my mouth to prevent myself from screaming as Tyler flailed, struggling to breathe as he dangled in the air. 

I didn’t have to watch for long, though, as Derick then took the camera, pointed it directly at himself, and spoke words straight into my heart and mind. 

“He can’t hurt you anymore, honey. He’s the one hurting now. No one will ever hurt you again.” 

The video ended with him laughing this unhinged half-chuckle, half-cry laugh. 

The screen went to black, and I was left alone in a reality that felt like it was coming apart at the seems. 

As I said, this all happened last week. 

The police are now involved, the laptop has been confiscated, and Derick is now a wanted man. 

Don’t ask me where he is. I have no idea. 

All I know, is this man needs to be stopped before this can happen again, and I pray that police catch him while he’s still in the state. 

To Derick: 

Please. Please turn yourself in. Running will only make things worse, and you and I both know the only cosmic alignment you’ll be facing is from the inside of a jail cell. ",7,1766956109.0,scarystories,1,0.89,False
1py2jk4,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1py2jk4/my_boyfriend_has_been_lying_to_me/,My Boyfriend has Been Lying to me,"Hello everyone. My name is Diane Harris. 

I have recently discovered that my entire relationship has been a fabrication. Not the cheeky, ‘haha,’ quirky kind of hiccup. This is a big one. 

I guess I’ll just start off by saying: I am not suicidal. I’ve never thought about harming myself, nor have I been diagnosed with any type of mental illness. 

What I’m about to tell you is my recounting of what I believed to be a healthy, loving relationship. But, as I learned last week, was nothing more than a case of “lonely girl falls into the clutches of a complete and utter psychopath.” 

Derick was 25 when we first met. I had graduated high school a year prior and, I hate to admit, I was more impressionable than I should’ve been. 

When we first laid eyes on each other at that frat party it was like all noise stopped. It was just me and him, completely entranced by one another. 

He stood alone, which I thought was a bit strange. He just sort of hung around the kitchen, fixing himself a drink after we finally broke eye contact. 

I, however, couldn’t stop myself from glancing at him, no matter how hard I tried. 

His curly hair and shadowy beard did wonders for my imagination; so much so that just watching him as he made his drink made my stomach do flip flops. Ah, and his eyes. They were smoldering. A piercing blue that stabbed my heart like an arrow from Cupid himself. 

Terrified to make the first move, it was as though an unspoken prayer was answered when Derick confidently strutted in my direction holding not one, but TWO drinks. 

I’m no idiot. 

I know not to accept drinks from strangers. 

I think my hesitation must’ve been apparent in my face because, once he noticed, he sort of cocked an eyebrow at me and smirked. 

“You think I’m gonna drug you? I don’t drug, sweetie, I chug.” 

Those were his exact words before he took a swig from both glasses and extended one back in my direction. 

“If you’re unconscious, we’re both unconscious. Let’s hope there aren’t any weirdos at this party,” he said with a grin. 

This earned a chuckle out of me, and immediately set my mind at ease. 

We sat together on the sofa and chatted for about an hour before things turned personal. 

My friends approached us, informing me that they would be leaving soon and that if I wanted to do the same, I’d better pack it up with my little “boyfriend.” 

I waved them off, telling them that I’d uber home if need be. They nodded, telling me to text them if I needed anything, and after about half an hour, I couldn’t see them around the party anymore.

Derick started asking me where I grew up, how I ended up at the party, what school I attended, all things that I just thought were normal. 

I explained to him that I grew up in town, was invited to the party by some girlfriends who wanted to help me get over a pretty traumatic breakup, and that I attended the community college at the edge of our county. 

The entire time I spoke, all he did was smile and nod his head. He was an amazing listener, and that only made my attraction for him grow. 

By the time I was finished with all of my personal exposition, he sort of cocked his head back and laced his fingers behind it. 

“Just the way it’s supposed to be, isn’t it?” he murmured. 

I was sure I’d misheard him, so I politely asked him to repeat himself. 

“Just this moment in time, you know. Every decision you’ve ever made has brought you to this moment, here, on this couch with me.” 

His eyes scanned the ceiling as he said this; as though he were searching for meaning in the support beams. 

I’d been in college long enough to understand “weed-speech” so I asked him if he’d been smoking. 

“I don’t smoke. Do you have any idea what that does to your lungs? I mean, I’m sure you do, you look like you were one of the smart kids in class.” 

This comment turned me off a little. It just seemed..I don’t know…dismissive? 

I subtly leaned away from him on the sofa, prompting him to respond in a way that earned my trust back immediately. 

“I didn’t mean that in any kind of ‘assumption’ way, or anything like that. I just meant you articulate yourself well. You give off that vibe, you know? That aura of intelligence.” 

I couldn’t hide my smile or the stars in my eyes that this comment had created, and I know he picked up on it. 

“As I was saying…You and me. Here. On this couch. You don’t think that’s a LITTLE bit cosmically aligned? I mean, you saw me. I saw you. You didn’t reject my drink OR my conversation. Why don’t we see if there’s a spark?” 

“A spark..?” I questioned. “With a drunk guy I met at a frat party? Odds are low, buddy. Odds are real low.” 

I sort of flirtatiously shoved his arm and we shared a little laugh before he responded. 

“Only thing I’m drunk on is loveee, sweetheart. Let’s say we make a toast,” he smirked. 

Fuck it. Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it. 

His eyes teased me. His lips begged me. His slightly drunk body language immersed me. 

“You know what? Fuck it. Let’s see what happens,” I announced before slowly leaning in closer towards him. 

His hand found its way to my cheek and, before I knew it, Derick and I were 15 minutes into a makeout session on some random frat house sofa. 

He began getting a little handsy, but I allowed it on account of me being a bit tipsy myself. 

We were both just so engulfed in the experience; the only thing that snapped us out of it was when a characteristically “frat-bro” voice called out from across the room. 

“Don’t wet your panties on my sofa, girl in the community college hoodie. That goes for you too old guy at the frat party.” 

We pulled away from each other, both embarrassed, and were greeted by what seemed to be every pair of eyes glaring directly into our souls. 

I hated that frat guy. I hated him for how he made us feel in that instant. 

Derick saved us, however, when he cried out, “I swear to GOD….I thought this was my house..” as he drunkenly stumbled to his feet and took me by the hand. 

“C’mon Diane,” he chirped. “Let’s find the right house.” 

I giggled a bit, allowing him to guide me through the crowd of people and out the door. 

At this point, I was definitely feeling the effects of the alcohol as I stumbled down the street, Derick catching me and supporting my flails with a firm grasp. 

I’m not sure when we arrived at his house, but when we did we were almost animalistic. 

It had actually taken me a few months to feel comfortable with a man after what had happened with my ex, but this night, I had completely allowed myself to be free. 

Derick and I kissed sloppily as we tore each other’s clothes off, climbing the stairs without breaking the moment. 

Sex wasn’t non-consensual. I may have been intoxicated, but I knew I wanted it.  And so did Derick. 

After our “hot and bothered” session, we fell asleep in each other’s arms and I had a dreamless night. 

————————-

When I awoke the next morning, Derick snored beside me on his unmade bed, my head throbbed from my hangover, and I felt a deep sense of regret from having slept with a man I’d only met the day prior. 

As quiet as a church mouse, I gathered my belongings and slowly crept out of Derick’s front door, silently praying he wouldn’t wake up and force me into an awkward position. 

Thankfully, that didn’t happen. I simply hailed a cab and did my “walk of shame” directly through my own front door. 

I’d been pretty behind on some school assignments because of a depression that I was only just now coming out of, so I decided that I would use the day as a sort of “catch up” day to ensure I didn’t crash and burn. 

Throwing my headphones on and opening my laptop, I was soon fully immersed in the world of business management and excel. 

I tend to focus pretty hard on studying and assignments when it’s time for it, and because of that fact coupled with the fact that I had Radiohead blaring in my headphones, I could hardly make out the sound of the pounding that came from my front door. 

Surely enough, the knocking cut through my focus eventually, and I begrudgingly walked to my door, ready to tell off whatever salesman or Jehovahs witness that had the audacity to be banging on my door like they were the police. 

I swung the door open and was greeted by…Derick. Standing there. Smile wide as can be with roses in one hand and a box of chocolates in the other. 

I didn’t have time for this. 

“Cliche,” I hissed before attempting to shut the door. 

Dericks foot shot into the crack of my front door, and he plead with all of the sincerity in the world. 

“WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. PLEASE. Just…listen to me for a second. I really liked you, you know? I wasn’t just bluffing to get you into bed last night. You could’ve told me you wanted to leave, I would’ve called you a cab myself. Just give me a sober chance, let’s get to know each other on a normal level rather than a drunk one.”

I did a bit of makeup and chose some subtly charming earrings that dangled loosely from my earlobes. 

I knew we were gonna be going to the park, so I knew I couldn’t dress TOO casual, and resorted to some Jean shorts and a crop top before dabbing my neck with some givenchy perfume and slipping on my tennis shoes. 

6 o’clock rolled around and the moment it did, 3 light knocks came from my front door. 

I opened it and Derick’s eyes lit up as though he were in the presence of an Angel.  

He told me how beautiful I looked and took me by the hand, guiding me to his vehicle.

“No real man would ever put his hands on a woman like you.” 

He seems to froth at the mouth as he said this, like he was suppressing a deep, deep rage. 

“You mean no real man would ever put hands on a woman period…right?” 

In an instant the color returned to his face and light returned to his eyes as he perked up. 

“Ah, oh, yes, I mean- sorry. That’s not what I meant, I meant I just couldn’t-“ 

I stepped in front of him and placed a hand on his chest. 

“I know what you meant, silly. Don’t worry.” 

He looked relieved at this, and even blushed a little from his apparent internal frustration. 

We went back to walking, and as a little sign of reassurance, I grabbed his hand and held it tightly as we walked together. 

There was some scattered chitchat here and there between the two of us from that point on, but I think we both were mostly just enjoying the embrace and atmosphere. 

Once we reached the end of the trail, we turned around and went straight back from whence we came. 

Approaching his car, I noticed that Derick was…smiling…and trying to hide it. Unfortunately for him, there was no hiding anything from me in this moment. 

“What’s got you grinning over there,” I asked casually. 

He responded in a way that made my heart stop beating and melt all at once. 

“I’m just so happy to be here with you. I’ve really enjoyed this time we’ve had together, and I hope we can do it again sometime. I really like you, Diane.” 

“I’ve enjoyed this time together, too, Derick. And, as much as it PAINS ME TO ADMIT….I think I like you too,” I replied with a slight smile. 

On the car ride home, he nervously asked me if I’d be his girlfriend. And I said yes. 

We arrived back at my house, and I invited him in for a movie and snacks. 

There was no intimacy. He simply let me lay on his lap as we watched inside out 2 and munched on popcorn. 

I ended up falling asleep halfway through the movie, and when I awoke I heard Derick upstairs, shuffling around. 

I wrapped myself in the blanket we’d been using and slowly crept up the stairs to see what he was doing, only for him to pop out from behind the corner at the top and announce, “ITS NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE..you got a bathroom in here anywhere??” Jokingly. 

I pointed him in the direction of the bathroom and when he returned, I let him know that it was getting late and it was probably time for him to start heading home. 

He seemed hesitant, which worried me. But, in the end, he did end up going home. However, not before I finally garnered the sense to ask him how he knew where I lived. 

“You told me, remember? At the party. We were talking about it for like 20 minutes.” 

I thought about that for a moment. I mean, I could’ve. I didn’t really remember a lot from that night other than what I’m recalling here. 

“My address?” I questioned. 

“Well…no…but you did tell me you lived in the blue house on maple street.”

“Derick…every house is blue…” 

“Well, why do you think the chocolates were melting? I had to find your house through sheer willpower, you never even gave me a phone number.” 

That makes sense, right? I mean, after all that he’d done just to get my attention, I didn’t doubt for a second that he’d gone door to door until he found THE door. 
 
Too tired to question him further, I thanked him for a nice night, and sent him on his way, providing him with a nice kiss on the lips to hold him over until we saw each other again. 

The next few months were filled with laughs, love, memories, and a kind of melancholic ache that was brought on by the news of my ex boyfriend’s suicide. 

I hated the man. I, more than anyone, wanted him dead. But I’d still loved him once. There was still that quiet tingling in my brain that made me want to cry thinking about what had happened. 

He’d hung himself in his parent’s garage, leaving a note that blamed nobody but himself. 

It stung. It hurt worse, in my opinion, that I had to find the news out through social media, where his picture circulated across mutual friends accounts who told him to “fly high” and to “rest easy.” 

I cried. I can admit that I cried. And I think that’s when the cracks started forming. 

Derick seemed…annoyed that I was affected. I understand: he was an ex boyfriend who abused me. But, why? Why could I not feel emotion during a time like this. 

His voice grew colder, his smile came less frequently, he seemed personally offended that I had been upset over something he classified as “deserved.” 

At this point, I’d already given 6 months of my time to this man, and my heart belonged to him entirely. 

I’d learned to shrug off his passiveness, his random outbursts, but, our relationship became incredibly rocky when he began punching walls, like a child. 

THAT, I didn’t find cute nor attractive. And I told him that. He’d just look at me with those puppy eyes and apologize with a sincerity I don’t even think Shakespeare could capture. 

I wanted to escape, but he just kept roping me back in with his manipulation and lovebombing. 

Argument? Here’s flowers, but no change. Dericks annoyed? I better be a cushion to his anger, or else I’m the bad guy. I was trapped. 

For months this went on, and my Stockholm syndrome grew more and more with each bout of passive aggression. 

One day, while drunk, Derick let something slip that I’ll never forget. 

He was sitting on the couch, feet propped up on my coffee table, and absolutely out of nowhere, completely unprovoked, he talked not to me, but at me. 

“You know. It’s good that your ex is gone. He’s caused enough tears. Why give him more?” 

I couldn’t do it. 

I decided to stay at my mother’s that night. Leaving my OWN home. 

When I returned, Derick was nowhere to be found. However, a note left on the table informed me that he had gone to the bar and wouldn’t be back till late. 

I couldn’t help but feel relieved at this. I needed it. Desperately. And I slept better that night than I had since, I couldn’t even remember when.

The next few weeks were…awkward…at best. 

A switch in Derick’s mind seemed to had been flipped, and I couldn’t even get more than 2 words out of him at a time. 

My heart was breaking all over again, and I felt utter shame ripple through my body at the realization that I had allowed this to happen. 

I began to rewire my brain, convincing myself that none of this was worthy of my time. Not Derick, not the manipulation, not the lovebombing, none of it. 

As if answered by some bizarre cosmic joke, the line was completely severed last week. 

Derick and I had been living in the same house, but were two distant strangers. My days were spent inside, trying to manage school and sanity. His days were spent doing God knows what. 

On this day in particular, though, he had come home earlier than usual, with a gift in his hands, neatly wrapped and tied with a bow. 

He offered it to me, and I felt my mind break even further. I’d made so much progress, and here he was, attempting to destroy it with his stupid gift giving. 

I told him that I didn’t even want it, but thanked him for thinking about me before turning around and heading towards my bedroom. 

He didn’t say a single word. He just left the gift on the coffee table and was back out the front door before I could notice. 

Time went on and Derick never returned. 

Curiosity began to eat at me. His gifts were always extravagant and meaningful, and the thought of what it could be toyed with me. 

In the late hours of the night, I couldn’t sleep and the curiosity finally broke me as I tip-toed downstairs to take a look at the gift. 

Tied to the bow with a thread of yarn was a handwritten note that I could tell was written by Derick. 

It read, “Diane. I’m sorry for everything. I hope this brings you peace. Do not look for me.” 

This made my curiosity turn morbid, and ever so slowly I began to unwrap the gift. 

Inside, I found a brand new MacBook, still in the box. Along with a single usb stick. 

Connecting the stick to the laptop, a file appeared on screen, simply titled, “For Diane.” 

Within the file, I found hundreds- and I mean hundreds- of screenshots. 

My social media. Pictures from before me and Derick became a thing. Photos of me holding sunflowers, a tweet of mine where I said something along the lines of “wishing someone would get me some cherry-filled chocolates”, snapshots of me and my ex taken from obscure angles. 

More horrifying, were the videos. 

Security footage, dated back before me and Derick even knew each other. Footage of me, at home, studying. Showering. Brushing my teeth. Having “me time,” if you catch my drift. 

I had never felt more sticky and violated, but still, I continued perusing the files contents. 

Buried deep within the screenshots and violations of privacy, I found a longer video. A video with a setting that I recognized only faintly. 

I clicked on it, and was greeted with blurry, pixilated camera footage of what seemed to be a dark, empty room. 

Suddenly, the lights flicked on and I came to the horrifying realization of what I was seeing. 

My ex boyfriend’s garage. 

Muffled shouting could be heard off camera before Derick marched my ex boyfriend into the frame, holding a matte black pistol to the back of his head. 

Without moving the gun, Derick’s head turned towards the camera, and he forced ex boyfriend to speak. 

“Now. Go ahead and tell the camera what we rehearsed,” Derick demanded, waving the gun in my ex boyfriend’s face. 

My ex cried. Tears streamed down his face as he struggled to speak. 

“We don’t have all day, Tyler. Do it.” 

Tyler turned to the camera with empty eyes, and sobbed the words that will haunt my memory forever. 

“I’m doing this for you, Diane.” 

Derick then tossed Tyler a rope. Kicked a chair towards him. And demanded he hang himself. 

Tyler’s wails were soul shattering and terrifying. I could see the will to live in his eyes. The hope on his face that he’d make it out of this. 

Forced into submission, Tyler slowly climbed up on the chair, slipped the rope around his neck, attached it to the garage door track, and mustered one final plea before Derick kicked the chair for him. 

I had to cover my mouth to prevent myself from screaming as Tyler flailed, struggling to breathe as he dangled in the air. 

I didn’t have to watch for long, though, as Derick then took the camera, pointed it directly at himself, and spoke words straight into my heart and mind. 

“He can’t hurt you anymore, honey. He’s the one hurting now. No one will ever hurt you again.” 

The video ended with him laughing this unhinged half-chuckle, half-cry laugh. 

The screen went to black, and I was left alone in a reality that felt like it was coming apart at the seems. 

As I said, this all happened last week. 

The police are now involved, the laptop has been confiscated, and Derick is now a wanted man. 

Don’t ask me where he is. I have no idea. 

All I know, is this man needs to be stopped before this can happen again, and I pray that police catch him while he’s still in the state. 

To Derick: 

Please. Please turn yourself in. Running will only make things worse, and you and I both know the only cosmic alignment you’ll be facing is from the inside of a jail cell. ",1,1766956089.0,story,1,0.67,False
1py2j80,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpinalTapHorror/comments/1py2j80/my_boyfriend_has_been_lying_to_me/,My Boyfriend has Been Lying to me,"Hello everyone. My name is Diane Harris. 

I have recently discovered that my entire relationship has been a fabrication. Not the cheeky, ‘haha,’ quirky kind of hiccup. This is a big one. 

I guess I’ll just start off by saying: I am not suicidal. I’ve never thought about harming myself, nor have I been diagnosed with any type of mental illness. 

What I’m about to tell you is my recounting of what I believed to be a healthy, loving relationship. But, as I learned last week, was nothing more than a case of “lonely girl falls into the clutches of a complete and utter psychopath.” 

Derick was 25 when we first met. I had graduated high school a year prior and, I hate to admit, I was more impressionable than I should’ve been. 

When we first laid eyes on each other at that frat party it was like all noise stopped. It was just me and him, completely entranced by one another. 

He stood alone, which I thought was a bit strange. He just sort of hung around the kitchen, fixing himself a drink after we finally broke eye contact. 

I, however, couldn’t stop myself from glancing at him, no matter how hard I tried. 

His curly hair and shadowy beard did wonders for my imagination; so much so that just watching him as he made his drink made my stomach do flip flops. Ah, and his eyes. They were smoldering. A piercing blue that stabbed my heart like an arrow from Cupid himself. 

Terrified to make the first move, it was as though an unspoken prayer was answered when Derick confidently strutted in my direction holding not one, but TWO drinks. 

I’m no idiot. 

I know not to accept drinks from strangers. 

I think my hesitation must’ve been apparent in my face because, once he noticed, he sort of cocked an eyebrow at me and smirked. 

“You think I’m gonna drug you? I don’t drug, sweetie, I chug.” 

Those were his exact words before he took a swig from both glasses and extended one back in my direction. 

“If you’re unconscious, we’re both unconscious. Let’s hope there aren’t any weirdos at this party,” he said with a grin. 

This earned a chuckle out of me, and immediately set my mind at ease. 

We sat together on the sofa and chatted for about an hour before things turned personal. 

My friends approached us, informing me that they would be leaving soon and that if I wanted to do the same, I’d better pack it up with my little “boyfriend.” 

I waved them off, telling them that I’d uber home if need be. They nodded, telling me to text them if I needed anything, and after about half an hour, I couldn’t see them around the party anymore.

Derick started asking me where I grew up, how I ended up at the party, what school I attended, all things that I just thought were normal. 

I explained to him that I grew up in town, was invited to the party by some girlfriends who wanted to help me get over a pretty traumatic breakup, and that I attended the community college at the edge of our county. 

The entire time I spoke, all he did was smile and nod his head. He was an amazing listener, and that only made my attraction for him grow. 

By the time I was finished with all of my personal exposition, he sort of cocked his head back and laced his fingers behind it. 

“Just the way it’s supposed to be, isn’t it?” he murmured. 

I was sure I’d misheard him, so I politely asked him to repeat himself. 

“Just this moment in time, you know. Every decision you’ve ever made has brought you to this moment, here, on this couch with me.” 

His eyes scanned the ceiling as he said this; as though he were searching for meaning in the support beams. 

I’d been in college long enough to understand “weed-speech” so I asked him if he’d been smoking. 

“I don’t smoke. Do you have any idea what that does to your lungs? I mean, I’m sure you do, you look like you were one of the smart kids in class.” 

This comment turned me off a little. It just seemed..I don’t know…dismissive? 

I subtly leaned away from him on the sofa, prompting him to respond in a way that earned my trust back immediately. 

“I didn’t mean that in any kind of ‘assumption’ way, or anything like that. I just meant you articulate yourself well. You give off that vibe, you know? That aura of intelligence.” 

I couldn’t hide my smile or the stars in my eyes that this comment had created, and I know he picked up on it. 

“As I was saying…You and me. Here. On this couch. You don’t think that’s a LITTLE bit cosmically aligned? I mean, you saw me. I saw you. You didn’t reject my drink OR my conversation. Why don’t we see if there’s a spark?” 

“A spark..?” I questioned. “With a drunk guy I met at a frat party? Odds are low, buddy. Odds are real low.” 

I sort of flirtatiously shoved his arm and we shared a little laugh before he responded. 

“Only thing I’m drunk on is loveee, sweetheart. Let’s say we make a toast,” he smirked. 

Fuck it. Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it. 

His eyes teased me. His lips begged me. His slightly drunk body language immersed me. 

“You know what? Fuck it. Let’s see what happens,” I announced before slowly leaning in closer towards him. 

His hand found its way to my cheek and, before I knew it, Derick and I were 15 minutes into a makeout session on some random frat house sofa. 

He began getting a little handsy, but I allowed it on account of me being a bit tipsy myself. 

We were both just so engulfed in the experience; the only thing that snapped us out of it was when a characteristically “frat-bro” voice called out from across the room. 

“Don’t wet your panties on my sofa, girl in the community college hoodie. That goes for you too old guy at the frat party.” 

We pulled away from each other, both embarrassed, and were greeted by what seemed to be every pair of eyes glaring directly into our souls. 

I hated that frat guy. I hated him for how he made us feel in that instant. 

Derick saved us, however, when he cried out, “I swear to GOD….I thought this was my house..” as he drunkenly stumbled to his feet and took me by the hand. 

“C’mon Diane,” he chirped. “Let’s find the right house.” 

I giggled a bit, allowing him to guide me through the crowd of people and out the door. 

At this point, I was definitely feeling the effects of the alcohol as I stumbled down the street, Derick catching me and supporting my flails with a firm grasp. 

I’m not sure when we arrived at his house, but when we did we were almost animalistic. 

It had actually taken me a few months to feel comfortable with a man after what had happened with my ex, but this night, I had completely allowed myself to be free. 

Derick and I kissed sloppily as we tore each other’s clothes off, climbing the stairs without breaking the moment. 

Sex wasn’t non-consensual. I may have been intoxicated, but I knew I wanted it.  And so did Derick. 

After our “hot and bothered” session, we fell asleep in each other’s arms and I had a dreamless night. 

————————-

When I awoke the next morning, Derick snored beside me on his unmade bed, my head throbbed from my hangover, and I felt a deep sense of regret from having slept with a man I’d only met the day prior. 

As quiet as a church mouse, I gathered my belongings and slowly crept out of Derick’s front door, silently praying he wouldn’t wake up and force me into an awkward position. 

Thankfully, that didn’t happen. I simply hailed a cab and did my “walk of shame” directly through my own front door. 

I’d been pretty behind on some school assignments because of a depression that I was only just now coming out of, so I decided that I would use the day as a sort of “catch up” day to ensure I didn’t crash and burn. 

Throwing my headphones on and opening my laptop, I was soon fully immersed in the world of business management and excel. 

I tend to focus pretty hard on studying and assignments when it’s time for it, and because of that fact coupled with the fact that I had Radiohead blaring in my headphones, I could hardly make out the sound of the pounding that came from my front door. 

Surely enough, the knocking cut through my focus eventually, and I begrudgingly walked to my door, ready to tell off whatever salesman or Jehovahs witness that had the audacity to be banging on my door like they were the police. 

I swung the door open and was greeted by…Derick. Standing there. Smile wide as can be with roses in one hand and a box of chocolates in the other. 

I didn’t have time for this. 

“Cliche,” I hissed before attempting to shut the door. 

Dericks foot shot into the crack of my front door, and he plead with all of the sincerity in the world. 

“WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. PLEASE. Just…listen to me for a second. I really liked you, you know? I wasn’t just bluffing to get you into bed last night. You could’ve told me you wanted to leave, I would’ve called you a cab myself. Just give me a sober chance, let’s get to know each other on a normal level rather than a drunk one.”

Opening the door ever so slightly to peek my head at him, I found it hard to resist his clumsy smile, even as a sober woman. 

“Listen, you seem sweet. I love the…enthusiasm… but I’ve got a lot of school work to do. I’ll talk to you la-“ 

Derick cut me off. 

“Dinner tonight. Anywhere you want. I just want to get the chance to know the REAL you. See if there’s a REAL spark; and I want you to want the same for me…” 

I pondered for a moment, staring down at my welcome mat. 

“I don’t want a fancy dinner. Let’s go to the park. We can walk the trails, and MAYBE…you’ll get to dinner eventually.” 

“Done. Absolutely. Now, here,” he plead. “Take these chocolates before they melt, it’s like 90 degrees out here.” 

I did as he asked, and before I could shut the door behind me, he slipped one last question in. 

“Wait, what time should I pick you up?” 

“6. If you’re late you blow it.” 

And with that, he shot me a smile and saluted me cartoonishly before the door finally shut in his face. 

I should’ve recognized that I hadn’t given him my address. I should’ve realized that this man knew where I lived without me saying anything more than “I’m from here in town.” 

Instead, all I felt were butterflies. 

I tried to hide it to his face, but inside I was absolutely melting. 

Not only did he manage to pick my favorite flowers (sunflowers), but he’d also picked the chocolates that were exclusively cherry-filled. 

“Maybe he IS someone special,” I thought to myself, remembering his speech about cosmic alignment. 

Dialing myself back, I returned to my computer until 5:00. I’ll admit, I wanted to look good. Not “try-hard” good, but decent. Feminine, you know? 

I did a bit of makeup and chose some subtly charming earrings that dangled loosely from my earlobes. 

I knew we were gonna be going to the park, so I knew I couldn’t dress TOO casual, and resorted to some Jean shorts and a crop top before dabbing my neck with some givenchy perfume and slipping on my tennis shoes. 

6 o’clock rolled around and the moment it did, 3 light knocks came from my front door. 

I opened it and Derick’s eyes lit up as though he were in the presence of an Angel.  

He told me how beautiful I looked and took me by the hand, guiding me to his vehicle. 

We actually talked…efficiently…on the way to the park. 

He was a sparkling conversationalist and there was never a low point in what we talked about. 

Arriving at the park, we obviously jumped straight into our walk, and the conversation persisted. 

We jumped from topic to topic. He told me about his job in digital security, about his interests, what his plans for the future were, etc. 

Eventually, the conversation moved into the topic of my ex boyfriend. 

At this point, I had already subconsciously began trusting Derick, and felt that sharing some secrets with him wouldn’t hurt. 

“Yeah. He’s…he was definitely not safe,” I muttered, softly. 

“Not safe how?” Derick replied, curious. 

“He just..he did things. Things that I don’t like to talk about.” 

Without missing a beat, Derick replied with, “look, Diane. I know we don’t have that much history, yet, but you can tell me whatever’s on your heart. I’m here to listen. Get to know you, remember?” 

I thought for a moment, dozens of ugly memories flooding my head like a sickness. 

“He hit me a few times. I don’t think he was ever really taught any better. His dad abused his mom, and I think that made him think it was okay. He’s been out of my life for a while, now. I just really wanna put the whole thing behind me. That’s why I’m here with you, Mr Rebound-Guy,” I chuckled. 

Derick didn’t laugh. He didn’t even smirk. Instead, his jaw tightened and his face looked flush as he gritted his teeth. 

“You alright there, bud?” I asked, jokingly. 

He didn’t respond right away, letting silence linger in the air for an uncomfortable amount of time before finally uttering one single sentence. 

“No real man would ever put his hands on a woman like you.” 

He seems to froth at the mouth as he said this, like he was suppressing a deep, deep rage. 

“You mean no real man would ever put hands on a woman period…right?” 

In an instant the color returned to his face and light returned to his eyes as he perked up. 

“Ah, oh, yes, I mean- sorry. That’s not what I meant, I meant I just couldn’t-“ 

I stepped in front of him and placed a hand on his chest. 

“I know what you meant, silly. Don’t worry.” 

He looked relieved at this, and even blushed a little from his apparent internal frustration. 

We went back to walking, and as a little sign of reassurance, I grabbed his hand and held it tightly as we walked together. 

There was some scattered chitchat here and there between the two of us from that point on, but I think we both were mostly just enjoying the embrace and atmosphere.

“I’m just so happy to be here with you. I’ve really enjoyed this time we’ve had together, and I hope we can do it again sometime. I really like you, Diane.” 

“I’ve enjoyed this time together, too, Derick. And, as much as it PAINS ME TO ADMIT….I think I like you too,” I replied with a slight smile. 

On the car ride home, he nervously asked me if I’d be his girlfriend. And I said yes. 

We arrived back at my house, and I invited him in for a movie and snacks. 

There was no intimacy. He simply let me lay on his lap as we watched inside out 2 and munched on popcorn. 

I ended up falling asleep halfway through the movie, and when I awoke I heard Derick upstairs, shuffling around. 

I wrapped myself in the blanket we’d been using and slowly crept up the stairs to see what he was doing, only for him to pop out from behind the corner at the top and announce, “ITS NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE..you got a bathroom in here anywhere??” Jokingly. 

I pointed him in the direction of the bathroom and when he returned, I let him know that it was getting late and it was probably time for him to start heading home.

I wanted to escape, but he just kept roping me back in with his manipulation and lovebombing. 

Argument? Here’s flowers, but no change. Dericks annoyed? I better be a cushion to his anger, or else I’m the bad guy. I was trapped. 

For months this went on, and my Stockholm syndrome grew more and more with each bout of passive aggression.

He offered it to me, and I felt my mind break even further. I’d made so much progress, and here he was, attempting to destroy it with his stupid gift giving. 

I told him that I didn’t even want it, but thanked him for thinking about me before turning around and heading towards my bedroom. 

He didn’t say a single word. He just left the gift on the coffee table and was back out the front door before I could notice. 

Time went on and Derick never returned. 

Curiosity began to eat at me. His gifts were always extravagant and meaningful, and the thought of what it could be toyed with me. 

In the late hours of the night, I couldn’t sleep and the curiosity finally broke me as I tip-toed downstairs to take a look at the gift. 

Tied to the bow with a thread of yarn was a handwritten note that I could tell was written by Derick. 

It read, “Diane. I’m sorry for everything. I hope this brings you peace. Do not look for me.” 

This made my curiosity turn morbid, and ever so slowly I began to unwrap the gift. 

Inside, I found a brand new MacBook, still in the box. Along with a single usb stick. 

Connecting the stick to the laptop, a file appeared on screen, simply titled, “For Diane.” 

Within the file, I found hundreds- and I mean hundreds- of screenshots. 

My social media. Pictures from before me and Derick became a thing. Photos of me holding sunflowers, a tweet of mine where I said something along the lines of “wishing someone would get me some cherry-filled chocolates”, snapshots of me and my ex taken from obscure angles. 

More horrifying, were the videos. 

Security footage, dated back before me and Derick even knew each other. Footage of me, at home, studying. Showering. Brushing my teeth. Having “me time,” if you catch my drift. 

I had never felt more sticky and violated, but still, I continued perusing the files contents. 

Buried deep within the screenshots and violations of privacy, I found a longer video. A video with a setting that I recognized only faintly. 

I clicked on it, and was greeted with blurry, pixilated camera footage of what seemed to be a dark, empty room. 

Suddenly, the lights flicked on and I came to the horrifying realization of what I was seeing. 

My ex boyfriend’s garage. 

Muffled shouting could be heard off camera before Derick marched my ex boyfriend into the frame, holding a matte black pistol to the back of his head. 

Without moving the gun, Derick’s head turned towards the camera, and he forced ex boyfriend to speak. 

“Now. Go ahead and tell the camera what we rehearsed,” Derick demanded, waving the gun in my ex boyfriend’s face. 

My ex cried. Tears streamed down his face as he struggled to speak. 

“We don’t have all day, Tyler. Do it.” 

Tyler turned to the camera with empty eyes, and sobbed the words that will haunt my memory forever. 

“I’m doing this for you, Diane.” 

Derick then tossed Tyler a rope. Kicked a chair towards him. And demanded he hang himself. 

Tyler’s wails were soul shattering and terrifying. I could see the will to live in his eyes. The hope on his face that he’d make it out of this. 

Forced into submission, Tyler slowly climbed up on the chair, slipped the rope around his neck, attached it to the garage door track, and mustered one final plea before Derick kicked the chair for him. 

I had to cover my mouth to prevent myself from screaming as Tyler flailed, struggling to breathe as he dangled in the air. 

I didn’t have to watch for long, though, as Derick then took the camera, pointed it directly at himself, and spoke words straight into my heart and mind. 

“He can’t hurt you anymore, honey. He’s the one hurting now. No one will ever hurt you again.” 

The video ended with him laughing this unhinged half-chuckle, half-cry laugh. 

The screen went to black, and I was left alone in a reality that felt like it was coming apart at the seems. 

As I said, this all happened last week. 

The police are now involved, the laptop has been confiscated, and Derick is now a wanted man. 

Don’t ask me where he is. I have no idea. 

All I know, is this man needs to be stopped before this can happen again, and I pray that police catch him while he’s still in the state. 

To Derick: 

Please. Please turn yourself in. Running will only make things worse, and you and I both know the only cosmic alignment you’ll be facing is from the inside of a jail cell. ",0,1766956066.0,SpinalTapHorror,1,0.5,False
1py2ix8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1py2ix8/my_boyfriend_has_been_lying_to_me/,My Boyfriend has Been Lying to Me,"Hello everyone. My name is Diane Harris. 

I have recently discovered that my entire relationship has been a fabrication. Not the cheeky, ‘haha,’ quirky kind of hiccup. This is a big one. 

I guess I’ll just start off by saying: I am not suicidal. I’ve never thought about harming myself, nor have I been diagnosed with any type of mental illness. 

What I’m about to tell you is my recounting of what I believed to be a healthy, loving relationship. But, as I learned last week, was nothing more than a case of “lonely girl falls into the clutches of a complete and utter psychopath.” 

Derick was 25 when we first met. I had graduated high school a year prior and, I hate to admit, I was more impressionable than I should’ve been. 

When we first laid eyes on each other at that frat party it was like all noise stopped. It was just me and him, completely entranced by one another. 

He stood alone, which I thought was a bit strange. He just sort of hung around the kitchen, fixing himself a drink after we finally broke eye contact. 

I, however, couldn’t stop myself from glancing at him, no matter how hard I tried. 

His curly hair and shadowy beard did wonders for my imagination; so much so that just watching him as he made his drink made my stomach do flip flops. Ah, and his eyes. They were smoldering. A piercing blue that stabbed my heart like an arrow from Cupid himself. 

Terrified to make the first move, it was as though an unspoken prayer was answered when Derick confidently strutted in my direction holding not one, but TWO drinks. 

I’m no idiot. 

I know not to accept drinks from strangers. 

I think my hesitation must’ve been apparent in my face because, once he noticed, he sort of cocked an eyebrow at me and smirked. 

“You think I’m gonna drug you? I don’t drug, sweetie, I chug.” 

Those were his exact words before he took a swig from both glasses and extended one back in my direction. 

“If you’re unconscious, we’re both unconscious. Let’s hope there aren’t any weirdos at this party,” he said with a grin. 

This earned a chuckle out of me, and immediately set my mind at ease. 

We sat together on the sofa and chatted for about an hour before things turned personal. 

My friends approached us, informing me that they would be leaving soon and that if I wanted to do the same, I’d better pack it up with my little “boyfriend.” 

I waved them off, telling them that I’d uber home if need be. They nodded, telling me to text them if I needed anything, and after about half an hour, I couldn’t see them around the party anymore.

Derick started asking me where I grew up, how I ended up at the party, what school I attended, all things that I just thought were normal. 

I explained to him that I grew up in town, was invited to the party by some girlfriends who wanted to help me get over a pretty traumatic breakup, and that I attended the community college at the edge of our county. 

The entire time I spoke, all he did was smile and nod his head. He was an amazing listener, and that only made my attraction for him grow. 

By the time I was finished with all of my personal exposition, he sort of cocked his head back and laced his fingers behind it. 

“Just the way it’s supposed to be, isn’t it?” he murmured. 

I was sure I’d misheard him, so I politely asked him to repeat himself. 

“Just this moment in time, you know. Every decision you’ve ever made has brought you to this moment, here, on this couch with me.” 

His eyes scanned the ceiling as he said this; as though he were searching for meaning in the support beams. 

I’d been in college long enough to understand “weed-speech” so I asked him if he’d been smoking. 

“I don’t smoke. Do you have any idea what that does to your lungs? I mean, I’m sure you do, you look like you were one of the smart kids in class.” 

This comment turned me off a little. It just seemed..I don’t know…dismissive? 

I subtly leaned away from him on the sofa, prompting him to respond in a way that earned my trust back immediately. 

“I didn’t mean that in any kind of ‘assumption’ way, or anything like that. I just meant you articulate yourself well. You give off that vibe, you know? That aura of intelligence.” 

I couldn’t hide my smile or the stars in my eyes that this comment had created, and I know he picked up on it. 

“As I was saying…You and me. Here. On this couch. You don’t think that’s a LITTLE bit cosmically aligned? I mean, you saw me. I saw you. You didn’t reject my drink OR my conversation. Why don’t we see if there’s a spark?” 

“A spark..?” I questioned. “With a drunk guy I met at a frat party? Odds are low, buddy. Odds are real low.” 

I sort of flirtatiously shoved his arm and we shared a little laugh before he responded. 

“Only thing I’m drunk on is loveee, sweetheart. Let’s say we make a toast,” he smirked. 

Fuck it. Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it. 

His eyes teased me. His lips begged me. His slightly drunk body language immersed me. 

“You know what? Fuck it. Let’s see what happens,” I announced before slowly leaning in closer towards him. 

His hand found its way to my cheek and, before I knew it, Derick and I were 15 minutes into a makeout session on some random frat house sofa. 

He began getting a little handsy, but I allowed it on account of me being a bit tipsy myself. 

We were both just so engulfed in the experience; the only thing that snapped us out of it was when a characteristically “frat-bro” voice called out from across the room. 

“Don’t wet your panties on my sofa, girl in the community college hoodie. That goes for you too old guy at the frat party.” 

We pulled away from each other, both embarrassed, and were greeted by what seemed to be every pair of eyes glaring directly into our souls. 

I hated that frat guy. I hated him for how he made us feel in that instant. 

Derick saved us, however, when he cried out, “I swear to GOD….I thought this was my house..” as he drunkenly stumbled to his feet and took me by the hand. 

“C’mon Diane,” he chirped. “Let’s find the right house.” 

I giggled a bit, allowing him to guide me through the crowd of people and out the door. 

At this point, I was definitely feeling the effects of the alcohol as I stumbled down the street, Derick catching me and supporting my flails with a firm grasp. 

I’m not sure when we arrived at his house, but when we did we were almost animalistic. 

It had actually taken me a few months to feel comfortable with a man after what had happened with my ex, but this night, I had completely allowed myself to be free. 

Derick and I kissed sloppily as we tore each other’s clothes off, climbing the stairs without breaking the moment. 

Sex wasn’t non-consensual. I may have been intoxicated, but I knew I wanted it.  And so did Derick. 

After our “hot and bothered” session, we fell asleep in each other’s arms and I had a dreamless night. 

————————-

When I awoke the next morning, Derick snored beside me on his unmade bed, my head throbbed from my hangover, and I felt a deep sense of regret from having slept with a man I’d only met the day prior. 

As quiet as a church mouse, I gathered my belongings and slowly crept out of Derick’s front door, silently praying he wouldn’t wake up and force me into an awkward position. 

Thankfully, that didn’t happen. I simply hailed a cab and did my “walk of shame” directly through my own front door. 

I’d been pretty behind on some school assignments because of a depression that I was only just now coming out of, so I decided that I would use the day as a sort of “catch up” day to ensure I didn’t crash and burn. 

Throwing my headphones on and opening my laptop, I was soon fully immersed in the world of business management and excel. 

I tend to focus pretty hard on studying and assignments when it’s time for it, and because of that fact coupled with the fact that I had Radiohead blaring in my headphones, I could hardly make out the sound of the pounding that came from my front door. 

Surely enough, the knocking cut through my focus eventually, and I begrudgingly walked to my door, ready to tell off whatever salesman or Jehovahs witness that had the audacity to be banging on my door like they were the police. 

I swung the door open and was greeted by…Derick. Standing there. Smile wide as can be with roses in one hand and a box of chocolates in the other. 

I didn’t have time for this. 

“Cliche,” I hissed before attempting to shut the door. 

Dericks foot shot into the crack of my front door, and he plead with all of the sincerity in the world. 

“WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. PLEASE. Just…listen to me for a second. I really liked you, you know? I wasn’t just bluffing to get you into bed last night. You could’ve told me you wanted to leave, I would’ve called you a cab myself. Just give me a sober chance, let’s get to know each other on a normal level rather than a drunk one.”

Opening the door ever so slightly to peek my head at him, I found it hard to resist his clumsy smile, even as a sober woman. 

“Listen, you seem sweet. I love the…enthusiasm… but I’ve got a lot of school work to do. I’ll talk to you la-“ 

Derick cut me off. 

“Dinner tonight. Anywhere you want. I just want to get the chance to know the REAL you. See if there’s a REAL spark; and I want you to want the same for me…” 

I pondered for a moment, staring down at my welcome mat. 

“I don’t want a fancy dinner. Let’s go to the park. We can walk the trails, and MAYBE…you’ll get to dinner eventually.” 

“Done. Absolutely. Now, here,” he plead. “Take these chocolates before they melt, it’s like 90 degrees out here.” 

I did as he asked, and before I could shut the door behind me, he slipped one last question in. 

“Wait, what time should I pick you up?” 

“6. If you’re late you blow it.” 

And with that, he shot me a smile and saluted me cartoonishly before the door finally shut in his face. 

I should’ve recognized that I hadn’t given him my address. I should’ve realized that this man knew where I lived without me saying anything more than “I’m from here in town.” 

Instead, all I felt were butterflies. 

I tried to hide it to his face, but inside I was absolutely melting. 

Not only did he manage to pick my favorite flowers (sunflowers), but he’d also picked the chocolates that were exclusively cherry-filled. 

“Maybe he IS someone special,” I thought to myself, remembering his speech about cosmic alignment. 

Dialing myself back, I returned to my computer until 5:00. I’ll admit, I wanted to look good. Not “try-hard” good, but decent. Feminine, you know? 

I did a bit of makeup and chose some subtly charming earrings that dangled loosely from my earlobes. 

I knew we were gonna be going to the park, so I knew I couldn’t dress TOO casual, and resorted to some Jean shorts and a crop top before dabbing my neck with some givenchy perfume and slipping on my tennis shoes. 

6 o’clock rolled around and the moment it did, 3 light knocks came from my front door. 

I opened it and Derick’s eyes lit up as though he were in the presence of an Angel.  

He told me how beautiful I looked and took me by the hand, guiding me to his vehicle. 

We actually talked…efficiently…on the way to the park. 

He was a sparkling conversationalist and there was never a low point in what we talked about. 

Arriving at the park, we obviously jumped straight into our walk, and the conversation persisted. 

We jumped from topic to topic. He told me about his job in digital security, about his interests, what his plans for the future were, etc. 

Eventually, the conversation moved into the topic of my ex boyfriend. 

At this point, I had already subconsciously began trusting Derick, and felt that sharing some secrets with him wouldn’t hurt. 

“Yeah. He’s…he was definitely not safe,” I muttered, softly. 

“Not safe how?” Derick replied, curious. 

“He just..he did things. Things that I don’t like to talk about.” 

Without missing a beat, Derick replied with, “look, Diane. I know we don’t have that much history, yet, but you can tell me whatever’s on your heart. I’m here to listen. Get to know you, remember?” 

I thought for a moment, dozens of ugly memories flooding my head like a sickness. 

“He hit me a few times. I don’t think he was ever really taught any better. His dad abused his mom, and I think that made him think it was okay. He’s been out of my life for a while, now. I just really wanna put the whole thing behind me. That’s why I’m here with you, Mr Rebound-Guy,” I chuckled. 

Derick didn’t laugh. He didn’t even smirk. Instead, his jaw tightened and his face looked flush as he gritted his teeth. 

“You alright there, bud?” I asked, jokingly. 

He didn’t respond right away, letting silence linger in the air for an uncomfortable amount of time before finally uttering one single sentence. 

“No real man would ever put his hands on a woman like you.” 

He seems to froth at the mouth as he said this, like he was suppressing a deep, deep rage. 

“You mean no real man would ever put hands on a woman period…right?” 

In an instant the color returned to his face and light returned to his eyes as he perked up. 

“Ah, oh, yes, I mean- sorry. That’s not what I meant, I meant I just couldn’t-“ 

I stepped in front of him and placed a hand on his chest. 

“I know what you meant, silly. Don’t worry.” 

He looked relieved at this, and even blushed a little from his apparent internal frustration. 

We went back to walking, and as a little sign of reassurance, I grabbed his hand and held it tightly as we walked together. 

There was some scattered chitchat here and there between the two of us from that point on, but I think we both were mostly just enjoying the embrace and atmosphere. 

Once we reached the end of the trail, we turned around and went straight back from whence we came. 

Approaching his car, I noticed that Derick was…smiling…and trying to hide it. Unfortunately for him, there was no hiding anything from me in this moment. 

“What’s got you grinning over there,” I asked casually. 

He responded in a way that made my heart stop beating and melt all at once. 

“I’m just so happy to be here with you. I’ve really enjoyed this time we’ve had together, and I hope we can do it again sometime. I really like you, Diane.” 

“I’ve enjoyed this time together, too, Derick. And, as much as it PAINS ME TO ADMIT….I think I like you too,” I replied with a slight smile. 

On the car ride home, he nervously asked me if I’d be his girlfriend. And I said yes. 

We arrived back at my house, and I invited him in for a movie and snacks. 

There was no intimacy. He simply let me lay on his lap as we watched inside out 2 and munched on popcorn. 

I ended up falling asleep halfway through the movie, and when I awoke I heard Derick upstairs, shuffling around. 

I wrapped myself in the blanket we’d been using and slowly crept up the stairs to see what he was doing, only for him to pop out from behind the corner at the top and announce, “ITS NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE..you got a bathroom in here anywhere??” Jokingly. 

I pointed him in the direction of the bathroom and when he returned, I let him know that it was getting late and it was probably time for him to start heading home. 

He seemed hesitant, which worried me. But, in the end, he did end up going home. However, not before I finally garnered the sense to ask him how he knew where I lived. 

“You told me, remember? At the party. We were talking about it for like 20 minutes.” 

I thought about that for a moment. I mean, I could’ve. I didn’t really remember a lot from that night other than what I’m recalling here. 

“My address?” I questioned. 

“Well…no…but you did tell me you lived in the blue house on maple street.”

“Derick…every house is blue…” 

“Well, why do you think the chocolates were melting? I had to find your house through sheer willpower, you never even gave me a phone number.” 

That makes sense, right? I mean, after all that he’d done just to get my attention, I didn’t doubt for a second that he’d gone door to door until he found THE door. 
 
Too tired to question him further, I thanked him for a nice night, and sent him on his way, providing him with a nice kiss on the lips to hold him over until we saw each other again. 

The next few months were filled with laughs, love, memories, and a kind of melancholic ache that was brought on by the news of my ex boyfriend’s suicide. 

I hated the man. I, more than anyone, wanted him dead. But I’d still loved him once. There was still that quiet tingling in my brain that made me want to cry thinking about what had happened. 

He’d hung himself in his parent’s garage, leaving a note that blamed nobody but himself. 

It stung. It hurt worse, in my opinion, that I had to find the news out through social media, where his picture circulated across mutual friends accounts who told him to “fly high” and to “rest easy.” 

I cried. I can admit that I cried. And I think that’s when the cracks started forming. 

Derick seemed…annoyed that I was affected. I understand: he was an ex boyfriend who abused me. But, why? Why could I not feel emotion during a time like this. 

His voice grew colder, his smile came less frequently, he seemed personally offended that I had been upset over something he classified as “deserved.” 

At this point, I’d already given 6 months of my time to this man, and my heart belonged to him entirely. 

I’d learned to shrug off his passiveness, his random outbursts, but, our relationship became incredibly rocky when he began punching walls, like a child. 

THAT, I didn’t find cute nor attractive. And I told him that. He’d just look at me with those puppy eyes and apologize with a sincerity I don’t even think Shakespeare could capture. 

I wanted to escape, but he just kept roping me back in with his manipulation and lovebombing. 

Argument? Here’s flowers, but no change. Dericks annoyed? I better be a cushion to his anger, or else I’m the bad guy. I was trapped. 

For months this went on, and my Stockholm syndrome grew more and more with each bout of passive aggression. 

One day, while drunk, Derick let something slip that I’ll never forget. 

He was sitting on the couch, feet propped up on my coffee table, and absolutely out of nowhere, completely unprovoked, he talked not to me, but at me. 

“You know. It’s good that your ex is gone. He’s caused enough tears. Why give him more?” 

I couldn’t do it. 

I decided to stay at my mother’s that night. Leaving my OWN home. 

When I returned, Derick was nowhere to be found. However, a note left on the table informed me that he had gone to the bar and wouldn’t be back till late. 

I couldn’t help but feel relieved at this. I needed it. Desperately. And I slept better that night than I had since, I couldn’t even remember when.

The next few weeks were…awkward…at best. 

A switch in Derick’s mind seemed to had been flipped, and I couldn’t even get more than 2 words out of him at a time. 

My heart was breaking all over again, and I felt utter shame ripple through my body at the realization that I had allowed this to happen. 

I began to rewire my brain, convincing myself that none of this was worthy of my time. Not Derick, not the manipulation, not the lovebombing, none of it. 

As if answered by some bizarre cosmic joke, the line was completely severed last week. 

Derick and I had been living in the same house, but were two distant strangers. My days were spent inside, trying to manage school and sanity. His days were spent doing God knows what. 

On this day in particular, though, he had come home earlier than usual, with a gift in his hands, neatly wrapped and tied with a bow. 

He offered it to me, and I felt my mind break even further. I’d made so much progress, and here he was, attempting to destroy it with his stupid gift giving. 

I told him that I didn’t even want it, but thanked him for thinking about me before turning around and heading towards my bedroom. 

He didn’t say a single word. He just left the gift on the coffee table and was back out the front door before I could notice. 

Time went on and Derick never returned. 

Curiosity began to eat at me. His gifts were always extravagant and meaningful, and the thought of what it could be toyed with me. 

In the late hours of the night, I couldn’t sleep and the curiosity finally broke me as I tip-toed downstairs to take a look at the gift. 

Tied to the bow with a thread of yarn was a handwritten note that I could tell was written by Derick. 

It read, “Diane. I’m sorry for everything. I hope this brings you peace. Do not look for me.” 

This made my curiosity turn morbid, and ever so slowly I began to unwrap the gift. 

Inside, I found a brand new MacBook, still in the box. Along with a single usb stick. 

Connecting the stick to the laptop, a file appeared on screen, simply titled, “For Diane.” 

Within the file, I found hundreds- and I mean hundreds- of screenshots. 

My social media. Pictures from before me and Derick became a thing. Photos of me holding sunflowers, a tweet of mine where I said something along the lines of “wishing someone would get me some cherry-filled chocolates”, snapshots of me and my ex taken from obscure angles. 

More horrifying, were the videos. 

Security footage, dated back before me and Derick even knew each other. Footage of me, at home, studying. Showering. Brushing my teeth. Having “me time,” if you catch my drift. 

I had never felt more sticky and violated, but still, I continued perusing the files contents. 

Buried deep within the screenshots and violations of privacy, I found a longer video. A video with a setting that I recognized only faintly. 

I clicked on it, and was greeted with blurry, pixilated camera footage of what seemed to be a dark, empty room. 

Suddenly, the lights flicked on and I came to the horrifying realization of what I was seeing.

Muffled shouting could be heard off camera before Derick marched my ex boyfriend into the frame, holding a matte black pistol to the back of his head. 

Without moving the gun, Derick’s head turned towards the camera, and he forced ex boyfriend to speak. 

“Now. Go ahead and tell the camera what we rehearsed,” Derick demanded, waving the gun in my ex boyfriend’s face. 

My ex cried. Tears streamed down his face as he struggled to speak. 

“We don’t have all day, Tyler. Do it.” 

Tyler turned to the camera with empty eyes, and sobbed the words that will haunt my memory forever. 

“I’m doing this for you, Diane.” 

Derick then tossed Tyler a rope. Kicked a chair towards him. And demanded he hang himself. 

Tyler’s wails were soul shattering and terrifying. I could see the will to live in his eyes. The hope on his face that he’d make it out of this. 

Forced into submission, Tyler slowly climbed up on the chair, slipped the rope around his neck, attached it to the garage door track, and mustered one final plea before Derick kicked the chair for him.

1py2huy,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1py2huy/sp_cicadas_at_thirty/,[SP] Cicadas at Thirty,"
I kept every promise I ever made to Marcus. Including the stupid ones. *Especially* the stupid one.

We were seventeen, drunk on wine coolers we'd stolen from his mom's fridge, sitting on his back porch one summer evening, listening to the cicadas buzzing in the woods out back. Like we were hot shit. Like we had the whole world figured out.

""Okay, but Agnes, seriously,"" Marcus said, gesturing with his neon blue bottle in a way that suggested this was, in fact, not serious at all. ""If we're both still single at thirty, we should just date each other. We already know we don't find each other annoying.""

""Wow, Marcus. Your romantic proposition has swept me off my feet.""

""I'm saying we're compatible! We like the same movies. You laugh at my jokes—""

""I laugh at most of your jokes.""

""See? That's realistic expectations right there. That's a foundation."" He held up his bottle. ""So? Deal?""

I clinked mine against his, rolling my eyes. ""Sure. Deal.""

In a few moments, his mom would come home early and catch us mid-sip, ending our little rebellion. But right then, it felt like we were the only people in the world. The cicadas buzzed throughout the night, the stars twinkled in the distant sky, looking down on two stupid kids with their futures well ahead of them.

Here's the thing nobody tells you about stupid promises you make at seventeen: sometimes you're the only one who remembers them. Sometimes you spend twelve years being the best friend, carefully maintaining that role while privately, pathetically, counting down to thirty like it's New Year's Eve.

And sometimes, three weeks before your thirtieth birthday, your best friend calls and asks you to coffee because there's ""someone he wants you to meet.""

I knew what that meant. Obviously I knew. But I went anyway, because that's what best friends do. They show up.

---

Rachel was lovely. Like, genuinely, frustratingly, impossibly lovely. The kind of person who laughs with her whole face and asks thoughtful questions and makes you want to like her even though you desperately don't want to.

The cafe door opened, the chime tinkling like a summer breeze, announcing Marcus' arrival. He wore this easy grin he used to when we were kids as he proudly showed me his drawings. That damned smile. It made me momentarily forget what we were doing here in the first place.

Then she walked in.

""Agnes!"" She said my name like we were already friends, pulling me into a hug, ""I've heard so much about you. Marcus says you basically taught him how to be a functional human.""

""Well, someone had to,"" I said, smiling so hard I thought my face might crack. ""He was eating cereal with orange juice when I met him.""

""I was eight,"" Marcus protested as they both took their seats. 

""You were clueless.""

Rachel laughed, bright and easy, and touched Marcus's arm. That casual intimacy. The ""we're together"" language of small gestures. I drank my latte and it tasted like sand.

""So, we've been dating about four months now,"" Marcus said, glancing at Rachel with this soft expression I'd never seen him make. Not at me, anyway. ""I wanted you guys to meet before my birthday. You know. Since you're my oldest friend and this is—"" He squeezed Rachel's hand. ""This is important to me.""

""That's amazing,"" I said. Even though my throat felt hollow, my voice sounded normal. Good job, voice. ""I'm so happy for you guys.""

I was not happy for them. I was dying inside, like something was poking my heart with a spork. I braved through it with a smile. They kept telling me stories—how they'd spent weekends together, how they were moving in next month, how everything was getting serious. I barely heard them, heart pounding as seconds ticked by. My eyes began to water. But that's fine. Everything's fine. No, seriously... I. Am. Fine.

I dashed inside my car before the crying started. I wanted to collapse right then and there, but I saw Rachel and Marcus chase after me, concerned. So I gunned it, peeling off the curb like some maniac. I bawled my eyes out then, turned the radio up so loud, I could barely hear myself think. Some random power metal track blared through the stereo as I flew down the street. Just your average heartbreak soundtrack. 

It must have been some sort of temporary psychosis. Time flew by so fast, the sun had set when I finally decided to stop driving. I had no recollection of which roads I'd taken, or where I had stopped. All I knew was I didn't want to go home. Home was where you spiral. I rested my head on the steering wheel, defeated. *Yeah, because I'm obviously doing peachy right now.*

The neon sign in front of the store depicted a wine bottle, flickering red in the gloom. I stared at it, the only sound was my car engine running.

*Ding!* went the chime as I went inside the liquor store, because if there was ever a time for bad decisions, this was it.

The clerk glanced at the counter, then at me, then at the armful of cheap wine I dropped in front of him.

He blinked. “Party?”

“Existential crisis,”

He nodded like that explained everything. “Paper or plastic?”

---

Drunk Agnes is significantly less rational than Sober Agnes, which is saying something because Sober Agnes once tried to dye her own hair at 2 AM and ended up orange for a month.

Drunk Agnes thought it would be meaningful to go back to the old neighborhood. To the street where Marcus and I grew up, where we'd made that stupid pact on his back porch. Maybe I was looking for closure. Maybe I was looking for evidence that I'd mattered. Maybe I was just really, really drunk.

A different family was living in that old house by now. It's a strange feeling, looking at your old haunts like a ghost. The memories were so crystal clear in your head, and on the surface, everything still looked the same, but you barely recognize the place anymore. A quiet ache settled in my bones. The light was on, the scent of home-cooked meal was inviting, and the laughter of children cut through the quiet of the night like a lighthouse in a storm. I couldn't be here. How much time, exactly, did I spend imagining my future with Marcus? I chugged from the wine bottle, forcing down the chalky, bitter-sour grape juice, grimaced and walked away.

---

The park at the end of the street looked different at night. Creepier. The swings moved in the wind like something out of a horror movie, and I was just drunk enough to think, *Yeah, perfect, this matches my vibe.*

I stumbled my way through the merry-go-round, lying on my back, staring at the distant sky, that same sky that bore witness to our pact. The stars twinkled down at me. That's when I saw it. Right above me—this weird shimmer in the air, like a lens, bending the stars from where I'm looking. Like heat waves, except it was October and I could see my breath.

""Okay,"" I said to the shimmer. ""Okay. I get it. I've finally lost my mind. This is rock bottom. This is where I'm at.""

The shimmer didn't respond, because it was a shimmer.

I reached out to it anyway.

It felt like the merry-go-round started turning slowly. It was odd. Like falling in a dream. Then it spun faster. The world twisted, my stomach lurched, and everything went sideways.

Then darkness.

---

I woke up on the merry-go-round in broad daylight to children pelting me with ice cream. I immediately sat up, looking around confused. I squinted at the brightness of it all. Somewhere in the background, an extremely peppy pop song blasted through a speaker.

*Was that Carly Rae Jepsen?* A student walked briskly by, sporting a backpack and multi-colored skinny jeans. Her hair swept in a *deep* side part, with volume up top, which is definitely a choice. I tilted my head. *Wired* earphones? I fished for my phone and was mortified—*My phone's a brick with a window!* Bulky. Thick bezels. A *physical* Home button. The tiny screen said it was September 2013.

My world spun. I checked my arms, my clothes. Finally, I turned my camera on.

I was seventeen years old again, wearing my old field hockey uniform and sporting a hangover that should not exist because teenage me hadn't even been drinking last night. Except I had. Would? Time travel grammar is confusing.

I shook my head, trying to regain focus. 2013. I was in high school. And I still had all my memories from 2025, including the part where Marcus was about to move in with his girlfriend.

*Wait,* My drunk brain was still playing catch up. That hasn't happened yet. Which means... ""I have to find Marcus,"" I stood up and dusted myself off.

---

He was hard to track down. I'd forgotten that we ended up in junior year with different classes altogether. So, I spent the day being seventeen with a thirty-year-old brain, which was exactly as weird as it sounded.

I ran into Ms. Harrison in the hallway, who I'd spent junior year being terrified of. She had always been too strict—a twenty-six year-old woman wearing a blazer two sizes too big. I'm older than her now, which was a depressing fact. *You were just a kid too*, I thought as she told me not to dawdle in the hallway. Funny how the things that seemed scary at seventeen were just... people doing their best.

Lunch was Emma's drama (God, I'd forgotten about that), some massive blow-up between her and Sarah that required an emergency mediation. I got drafted into a friendship summit and spent an hour listening to teenage emotions at their most operatic while I tried not to stab my own ear with the silverware.

They made up eventually, and by last period, the three of us ended up screaming *Here's to Never Growing Up*—Avril Lavigne's ""newest"" single, getting the words wrong and laughing our goofy asses home. I saw Marcus by his beat-up Toyota in the parking lot.

He jogged up to me with this open grin and my heart did somersaults. He was gangly and unguarded, like life still hadn't taught him to be less bold. He was so, so *young*. Like we all were, once.

""Where were you?"" He asked, ""I heard about lunch. I've been texting,""

I checked my brick of a phone. Fourteen messages, ranging from, ""Did u do ur calc homework?"" to ""R U DEAD?""

There was a time where a text from Marcus would make me squeal into my pillow, feet fluttering like an Olympic swimmer, ""Just... Got busy.""

He raised his eyebrows, but didn't push. He smirked as he took my backpack and tossed it in his car, ""Tell me more about it on the way.""

""On the way to where?""

---

By the time we escaped to the arcade after school, I was exhausted. Being seventeen was *loud*. Everything mattered so intensely yet none of it meant anything. It was all so... trivial. Still, I couldn’t stop smiling.

The air was thick with sugar and static. It smelled of popcorn, sweat, and old carpet. Every sound fought to be the loudest. Coins clattered, electronics beeped, some kids shrieked as they chased each other like it was life and death. I smiled. The floor pulsed under our sneakers from the Dance Dance Revolution platform in the corner.

It was chaos—stupid, beautiful chaos. And somehow, for the first time in years, I felt like I was part of it again.

That was when I remembered. This was the day of the pact.

""You're being weird today,"" Marcus said, focused on some racing game.

""Everyone keeps saying that.""

""Because it's true."" He glanced at me. 

""Is that okay?"" I said, shifting from foot to foot.

He shrugged, ""I like your weird. You're more... here. Present.""

Because I wasn't resigned to being the best friend while secretly wanting more. I was just... with him.

And maybe that was enough. Maybe that had always been enough. A part of me wondered if we'd always been this way, and the pact ruined it. I'd wasted twelve years waiting for something that had always been here.

He laughed as the game ended, still full of that reckless seventeen-year-old energy. A message popped up. He checked his phone and shrugged, ""You up for one more stop?”

“Where?” I asked, even though I knew.

He grinned. “You’ll see.”

---

Fireflies started coming out as dusk settled over the neighborhood. His mom was out. The wine coolers were exactly where I remembered.

We settled on the back porch as the cicadas started up and the stars came out, and I waited.

We talked about anything and everything, getting progressively buzzed as we talked about high school drama, about relationships, about our futures. I had to put conscious effort into not spoiling things for him. Getting buzzed on sugar and alcohol made it significantly harder.

We were laughing about Sarah and her on-and-off-again boyfriend when Marcus said, ""Okay, but Agnes, seriously,""

My heart stopped, these were the words that had haunted me for more than a decade. He gestured with his neon blue bottle, that easy grin on his face, ""If we're both still single—""

""Stop,” I said—almost in a panic. I don’t know what came over me. I just knew I couldn’t do this to my younger self again.

Marcus froze. “I only meant—”

I placed my hand over his. Younger me would never even dream of being this bold, but I needed him to hear it.

“Marcus… what if we didn’t have to wait?”

There was a moment—just a heartbeat—where the world held its breath. Marcus stared at me, wine cooler on his hand. The cicadas seemed to have gone quiet. Even the stars seemed to pause.

""Agnes,"" he said softly. ""Are you saying—""

The back door slammed open.

""MARCUS DANIEL GREEN, ARE THOSE MY WINE COOLERS?""

We both jumped about three feet. His mom stood in the doorway, hands on hips, but her mouth was twitching like she was trying not to laugh.

""Mom! You're supposed to be at book club until ten!""

""Book club ended early because Patricia got food poisoning from gas station sushi."" She spotted me. ""Agnes, honey, you're involved in this crime too?""

""I plead the fifth,"" I said, probably too quickly, trying so hard not to be a little shit.

She sighed, but she was definitely smiling now. ""Alright, hand them over. Both of you, inside. It's getting late. I'm not letting Marcus drive you home while you're buzzed.""

""Mom, we're barely—""

""Inside. Now.""

We shuffled in like guilty puppies. His mom confiscated the remaining bottles, shaking her head. ""You two are lucky I'm the cool mom. Your father would've grounded you until college.""

Marcus caught my eye and we both started giggling. His mom tried to look stern but failed completely.

""Agnes, sweetie, get your stuff"" she said. ""Marcus, you're doing dishes for a week.""

""Can we talk tomorrow?"" Marcus whispered as I grabbed my bag. His hand caught mine, just for a second. ""Like, a proper talk? Maybe... a date?""

My heart did backflips. A date. An actual date. ""Yeah. Yes. Definitely yes.""

""I'll text you in the morning.""

His mom drove me home, making small talk about school and telling me embarrassing stories about Marcus as a kid. I barely heard her. My brain was stuck on loop: He wants to go on a date. Marcus wants to go on a date with me.

When I got home, I collapsed on my bed, grinning at the ceiling like an idiot.
Tomorrow, everything would change.
Tomorrow, we'd finally talk about us.

Tomorrow, everything would change.
Tomorrow, we'd finally talk about us.

---

I felt it the second I crossed—heavier this time, slower, like the world hesitated before letting me back in. My stomach lurched, and then—

*Hey! I just met you...*

Carly Rae Jepsen. Again.

I was tempted to yell ""Shut up!"" before I even got my bearings.

I sat up on the merry-go-round, head spinning. The portal—or whatever it was—hadn't been a smooth ride this time. It dumped me into the past like it was on its last legs, and I knew I wouldn't get another chance. I mean—really—how often do miracles happen twice anyway?

""Okay,"" I said, trying to focus, ice cream dripping down my hair. I was back. One more shot. No do-overs.

All I had to do was make sure everything happened exactly the way it had before—make it to Marcus's house by nightfall and say yes to the pact. Simple.

So naturally, I immediately fucked it up.


---


Turns out, even walking slightly faster is enough to break a timeline.

The first time I was here, I'd wandered like I was reliving a memory—because I was. I stopped to look. Let the day happen to me. Now I was moving with purpose. Not running, not rushing—just... intent.

And somehow, that was enough to throw everything off.

I ran into Emma in the hallway before Ms. Harrison even showed up. My heart dropped. I'd just lived through an entire miserable timeline because I'd changed the past—and here I was, doing it again.

Emma spotted me, books clutched to her chest. ""Hey—do you have a minute?"" she asked, already halfway into the sentence. Her voice had that tight edge I recognized. Something mattered. Right now.

""Actually, I—"" I stopped myself.

*Where do you go?* the other Marcus had asked me.

""Yeah,"" I cleared my throat. ""I'm right here.""

She let out a breath and started talking. About Sarah. About the drama. I listened and told her—confidently, without being cryptic—that they'd be fine. Always will. And I could see her shoulders relax.

Ms. Harrison caught sight of us before I could say more.

""Girls,"" she said, arms crossed. ""Classes.""

""Yes, Ms. Harrison,"" Emma and I said in unison, shuffling away.

I glanced back and added, ""You were always my favorite, Ms. Harrison.""

She frowned, confused. Emma elbowed me, but I just smiled.

Sometimes, that's all people need to hear.

We parted with our hearts slightly lighter, going into different classes.

---

There was no lunch drama. Part of me was relieved—and part of me panicked.

I'd changed something again.

My heart thudded as Sarah and Emma giggled across the table. My hand shook as I checked my phone.

Three messages from Marcus. Not fourteen.

The lunch blowup had been the reason he took me to the arcade.

When I suggested we put on Avril after school, my friends blasted *Sk8er Boi* instead of the new one. Sarah and Emma screeched the lyrics by heart and I nearly tore my hair out. Not that it wasn't an iconic anthem, or that my friends sounded particularly awful.

It simply meant that things were changing so drastically now that I began feeling the day slip through my fingers.

My heart sank as we went outside. Marcus wasn't in the parking lot. I began pacing, breath shallow. *Okay, okay,* I pulled out my phone and texted him even though I hadn't in the original timeline. *This is fine,*

He was at the arcade.

Good.

He was early, but it's salvageable. I'd meet him there, hang out, then we'll make the pact on his porch.

*It's gonna work.*

Sarah dropped me off without me even having to make excuses—she and Emma had shopping to do.

The arcade's neon lights flickered red. I felt it before I even knew why. A horrible, sinking feeling. Like dropping your phone into the ocean's endless depths, knowing it’s gone before it even disappears. And all you could do was watch it sink gently further and further.

I scanned the parking lot as I walked around. There was no beat-up Toyota in sight.

---

I decided to call Marcus, even though I hadn’t the first time. Because I was losing him. Because I’d already fucked up the day enough that I didn’t care anymore.

My hands shook as I brought the phone to my ear.

“Hey,” he said. His voice was steady and my knees nearly gave out.

“Hey—uh. So. Crazy thing.” I swallowed. “I’m at the arcade right now. And I don’t see your car.”

A pause.

“Yeah,” he said slowly. “I went home early. Are you okay? Are you alone?”

He must have heard something in my voice. His concern hit harder than my panic. I covered my trembling lips.

*I have been alone,* I wanted to say. I’d been fighting fate all day, and I couldn't tell it to the one person I wanted to.

“Uh-huh,” I said instead, my voice shaking.

“I’m sorry,” he said. “Mom texted—book club. I figured I’d get a few hours of COD in.”

I closed my eyes. “Of course.”

This was wrong. All of it. None of this was supposed to happen. I thought of the future where we were strangers. I could feel him slipping away. Silence stretched between us, thin and unbearable.

“I could pick you up.” he suggested.

I opened my eyes. The sky was already burning orange at the edges. There was still time—but not much. His mom would be home early. My throat tightened.

I could say yes. Let him drive to me, ride back to his house. Perhaps we'd avoid traffic. Perhaps we'd beat his mom home.

I took a breath.

“No,” I said, feet already moving. “I’ll—can I come over?”

“Agnes—”

I started jogging. “There’s something I want to tell you. In person.”

“Are you sure you're okay?”

“I will be.” My breath hitched as I broke into a run. Because waiting for him here would kill me. Because standing still felt like surrender.

“I’ll see you soon,” I said—and hung up.

---

The sun was setting as I ran, my eyes focused ahead.

The streetlights bloomed to life one by one, amber halos flickering on like a countdown. My lungs burned, my legs screamed—but I was a seventeen-year-old midfielder, not some thirty-year-old woman who’d forgotten how to breathe through panic. I’d spent entire games running until my vision went white at the edges. I knew this feeling. Pain meant I was still moving.

*There's still time.*

The world narrowed to pavement and breath and the sound of my shoes slapping asphalt. Houses blurred past—porches, hedges, parked cars I half-recognized. Somewhere ahead was Marcus’s house. His porch. That stupid stretch of wood where everything had gone wrong and right and wrong again.

*I’m not losing you.*

The thought landed heavy in my chest, sharper than the ache in my legs. I wasn’t running to change the universe. I wasn’t running for romance or destiny or some neat cosmic fix.

I was running because losing him hurt too much.

I cut through a side street, then another—muscle memory guiding me. A shortcut. I hoped. I ducked under a low branch and nearly stumbled, hands scraping bark as I caught myself. My heart slammed against my ribs, wild and frantic.

*I'll fix it. I'll fix us.*

Every step felt like it mattered. Like if I slowed, if I hesitated, the day would harden around me like amber. Lock me in a world where my best friend and I drifted apart. Because I had always lived ahead. To that porch, to twelve years from now, to when I'm thirty.

Not this time. I'll spend the years *with* him instead of looking ahead.

But if I took that pact—

I jumped the curb and landed wrong. My shoe slipped, ankle twisting. Then my knee took my full weight before momentum caught up with me. I went down hard, hands scraping against the asphalt, trying to guard my head. Still, I slammed it against the concrete.

Ringing. I tasted my skull. There was no other way to describe it. I split my lip. There was iron in my sinuses.

I opened my mouth, lips pressed on the dirt, gasping to breathe but couldn't. A dog barked across the street. Twilight swallowed the last light and the stars had come out. The cicadas buzzed all around me. It was such a quiet neighborhood, and the sound of my world collapsing couldn't penetrate that silence. I was just a stupid kid, running headfirst, literally, into the unknown.

I rolled over, sucking in air. The stars stared back.

*It's not the pact,* I thought. *It was never about it.*

Tears welled in my eyes, my heart wringing until my chest was hollow.

*Then what?* I felt helpless. I wanted to scream. I wanted to curl up right there and wilt until tomorrow took me back. But there was still plenty of time between now and then.

I groaned and gingerly sat up. I didn't know what it was about anymore. I just knew I had to be there, with him. Before I returned to a life without us.

I stood up, stumbling, pain shooting up all over my body. My knee was bleeding, gravel embedded within the swelling.

Seconds. I'd wasted seconds.

I limped once, thrice. Pain flared with each step. I ignored it and continued running. My chest burned. My throat tasted like metal. Sweat soaked through my shirt, hair sticking to my face. And I was sobbing.

But I kept going.

Because he mattered.

Because this mattered.

Because even if I was wrong—especially if I was wrong—I had to be there.

Marcus’s street came into view at the end of the block

I didn’t slow down.

---

“Marcus!"" I yelled at the house.

Silence.

I was about to yell his name again when the door flew open. He took one look at me and froze.

“Agnes—what the fuck?!"" The look on his face was priceless.

I laughed. Hysterical. Thin. It ripped out of me before I could stop it, my chest nearly collapsing in on itself with relief.

“You’re bleeding,” he said, voice barely contained, already running towards me. “Did you—did you run all the way from the arcade?”

“I’m sorry,” I was breathing heavily, hands on my knees. ""I'm sorry,"" I said again. It all came out wrong—too fast, too loud, like if I stopped talking I’d fall apart completely. 

""Why? What happened?"" He was standing next to me, hands hovering, unsure. Like I was some fragile thing he doesn't know how to handle. I couldn't blame him. I could only imagine how I looked. He was probably wondering if I'd lost my mind. Perhaps I had.

""I don't know how to say this without sounding insane,"" I said, ""but I had a dream where we stopped talking, like, for a long time, and it was suffocating and weird and—""

""You—what?""

""It was—"" I hesitated, biting my split lip, ""It felt like a weight was put on my chest and it was awful, and I tried to fix things—God, I tried! But I just made things worse, and now I'm gonna lose you, and—""

""Hey, hey,"" He stepped closer and wrapped his arms around me, keeping me from falling apart. My shoulders shook silently.

""I have *no* idea what's gotten into you,"" he said, a smile on his voice, ""but you'll be alright. We'll be alright.""

I pressed my dumb face on his shirt. He doesn't know. That I'm saying goodbye. That I came, because I wanted to be here with him before everything fell apart. My eyes burned, I couldn't stop the tears, ""I'm sorry I messed up. I didn't mean to lose you.""

""I'm right here,"" he said gently, soothing.

""You don't understa--""

""You won't lose me,"" he held me by the shoulders, looked into my eyes, ""I promise.""

A promise.

The wind blew, pleasant after my run. The leaves sighed, hinting at the beginning of autumn. The stars looked a little brighter.

""I promise I'll stay."" He squeezed my shoulder, and somehow it steadied me, ""Even when things get messy. Even if we screw it up. Even when things get stupid— and we know things get *stupid*,""

I chuckled through my tears. I was such a mess.

""We'll be there for each other."" He finished, ""Deal?""

I gasped, my eyes widening. A heartbeat passed as I looked at him. The clinking sounds of our bottles echoed in my head. The porch light seemed to glow brighter as a realization dawned on me.

It wasn't the promise of a romance that kept us together. We were just too young to know what we truly meant.

A weird lightness bloomed in my chest. Buoyant. Persistent.

""Sure. Deal,"" I said, sniffling. The fireflies had come out, the cicadas hummed around us and the stars looked on, twinkling down on two stupid kids with their futures well ahead of them.

---

Rachel laughed at one of my Marcus stories. The cafe was bright in that Sunday morning kind of way. I didn't mind.

""Okay, for real,"" she said, leaning forward over her latte. ""What am I supposed to get him for his birthday?""

His thirtieth. Mine had come and gone weeks ago. I sipped my coffee and found it tasted different. Not exactly bad, just... different.

""He keeps saying 'nothing' but that's obviously a trap, right?"" Rachel continued.

I laughed. ""It's not a trap. He genuinely thinks he doesn't need anything.""

""That's worse! How do I shop for someone who's content?""

""Get him something stupid. A mug with a terrible pun. Socks with dogs on them. He'll love it because it's ridiculous and because you thought of him.""

She pulled out her phone, already searching. ""Socks with dogs. I can work with that.""

It had been three months since that disastrous coffee date when Marcus introduced Rachel and I.

I'd apologized and blamed my dramatic exit to me feeling ill. They didn't question it. I asked them out for another coffee date the next week. It was a little awkward, both Rachel and I tried too hard, talking around Marcus instead of to each other. The second one was better. By the third, we'd stopped performing.

Now it was just... easy.

Rachel was lovely. Still. Genuinely, frustratingly lovely. But I'd also learned she talked too loudly in movie theaters, always ordered the wrong thing at restaurants and spent the whole meal eyeing everyone else's plates. She got weirdly competitive about board games.

She was real. Flawed. Human.

And she loved Marcus.

""Found them!"" Rachel showed me her phone—socks covered in golden retrievers.

I laughed. Of course she picked that. ""Perfect. He'll wear them until they disintegrate.""

We chuckled until a message dinged on her phone. Marcus was supposed to pick her up.

""You're the best."" She flagged down the waiter for the check. ""We should do this again next week. Maybe wine instead of coffee?""

I made a face. ""I think I'm done with wine for a while.""

""Bad experience?""

""I'm honestly not sure,"" I said then cleared my throat, ""How about movie night at my apartment? You've seen *Star Wars*, right?""

""Oh, my God, yes. I love *Empire* the best."" She grinned and pulled me into a hug as we stood to leave. She smelled like vanilla and gave hugs that were just as sweet. ""Thanks for this. For helping.""

The door chimed as Marcus walked in, right on time to pick Rachel up. He hugged me—quick and familiar—while Rachel gathered her things.

""You two bonding over my many flaws?"" he asked.

""Absolutely,"" Rachel said. ""Agnes told me about the exploding basketball.""

""Hey, that was really scary,""

""Still counts.""

They left together, Rachel's hand finding his, their voices fading as the door closed behind Marcus.

I decided to stay for a bit. Ordered another coffee. Pulled out my laptop like I had work to do, but mostly I just sat there, watching the cafe move around me.

She wasn't taking Marcus from me. She was just loving him. Different than I did, but not less. Not more. Just... different.

And that was okay.

I took a sip of my coffee and smiled at nothing in particular.

The door opened behind me—the little bell chiming bright and clear.

Is there an electric kettle (gooseneck preferred since it's more versatile) with temperature control without such plastics that come in contact with the water, including the lid which catches condensation? 

Else I'm thinking a dumb electric kettle (or even a traditional kettle on a portable induction burner) with kettle thermometer attachment but honestly that seems less accurate and responsive than an electric kettle with this builtin functionality (anyone have experience with this)? I drink a lot of pourover and loose leaf tea so accurate temp control is important to me.

-------------------

Also looking for a insulated thermos of 32-64 oz where boiled water can be kept at temperatures hot enough to brew coffee/tea with throughout the day. Most importantly the lid should be a simple lid of narrow design (to limit exposure to the cool air when it's opened) and with a stainless steel interior (this is rare nowadays). Not sure if a thermos would be able to keep the water hot enough when it's half consumed though.

Might be wondering why I have done this, well my dumb ass decided to go on a “bulk” and it’s been destroying my insides.

I missed that big look I had before, even though when I had that look years ago I was killing myself to be shredded and lean.

That’s what sucks about my bipolar, I always do the extreme of everything. Either all in or nothing, eating 300g protein a day or like only 4-8 eggs and some meat OMAD… barely getting to 1500 cal if even that.

I recall OMAD or 2MAD making me feel great but I’d also get anxiety and jitters from being in a high cortisol state.

Maybe I have to just have some olive oil / mct until I break my fast?

Currently have a 28M bf who I have dated for 1.5 years and do really like him and is a nice guy. He’s taller and decently attractive. I moved to a new city where I knew no one and met him on an app when I was lonely. He has been good to me but I know and feel that we both know it is not for the long term. Up until recently I have had the plan to move back home to save money and I told myself I would break up with him at this point. Again he is nice to me and treats me well, but he is lazy, not a go getter, I don’t like his family or friends at all. We live about 45 minutes away from each other and never makes an effort to come see me or take me out and is always saying he needs to save money so we can’t go out or we have to split meals or events etc, we only see each other about once a week if I drive to him. A few months ago I met a guy who works in my building 32M (where I work is mostly older people except us) he started helping me with my work since I’ve only been here about 2 years and is good at his job. He just broke up with his gf about 6 months ago. I made it obvious I had a bf of course and before we started spending time together I was making it clear of dislikes/likes of my current relationship and that it’s not meant for long term which I’m looking for and how I can’t date some one my age and the things I want, etc just through conversation. Then we started getting coffees and lunches together, and texting each other constantly everyday, some deep topics and other things. And about three months ago we started spending a lot of time together at work on field projects and lunch, probably 4-5 hours a day, everyday and the conversations were so fluid on all conversations about relationships, wants, long term goals etc. about a month  we got dinner after work because we both were in the area after work and it was a nice time. Then he asked me to a second dinner (as friends) obviously he knew I have a bf. And as we were having dinner relationships came up and he said he would have asked me out already if I was single in the politest way possible not forcibly at all and we talked about it for a little but then went back ti dinner and ended up staying out until 2am just talking about anything and everything. Fast forward to last week we got dinner again and the conversation came up again how he likes me and that he thinks we would have a great time together in a relationship, except this time I agreed and we talked until 1am again but about details and questions we both had about each other for this relationship topic. I told him I really feel bad because I have a bf and again he wasn’t forcing anything at all and wasn’t bad mouthing my bf, but he knows we both want the same relationship and long term goals, how we both always want to see each other all the time. I really like him and know he can give me what I want in the relationship and have the same goals. It’s difficult because I was planning on moving home but don’t now mainly because of him and I told him that and his jaw dropped(not sure if this was as friends or romantically) I now have been gone a week for the holidays and have never wanted to be back this much before, idk if it’s because of him or not. I saw him mostly as a friend but that last dinner has me thinking about a romantic possibility. He’s very nice but confident, owns his own home and is financially secure and gentlemen like but also so funny also has a good friend group and support family.  only negatives are we are the same height and slightly less attractive then my current bf. Obviously this is a very difficult situation but he has been completely respectful and not pushy at all and not in considering a romantic possibility if we can talk more about it this week. I have never been in this situation before by having a bf and having a man actually pursue me the way he has been. I’m not one to get hit on very often and how this man is pursuing me is very positive and enlightening. He also told me that he has never pursued someone in a relationship and feels bad about it aswell but that he thinks we get along so well and would be perfect for each other. Again he’s mad it clear that he doesn’t want me to cheat(I never would) and actually wants to build a long term relationship and sees my potential in everything we’ve talked about.

So far for photography it has been good especially for DIY shows and some coffee shops however as I become more established a lot of people has been asking for videos, portraits and my desire to start a YouTube channel kinda like Valspire, life of riza or heyxnatalite has all been accumulating and really want to break that barrier. 

I’ve been thinking about a7iv since it has a flip screen, 10-bit and be a good second body for shows so I don’t have to swap lenses between songs lol. The only thing I’m hesitant is the rolling shutter. 

The a7cii on the sounds perfect as a second body but since I’m doing paid work the idea of not having a second SD slot terrifies me but since I have the 7iii I can be in a safe net.  

I do plan on buying a 85mm (viltrox or Sony) for portraits and food photography and sell my tamaron for the 35-150 despite me knowing the weight I feel like it would be an amazing lens for shows or should I invest in the 70-180 since I will have a second body to pair it with.  

Any recommendations from your experience is welcome!!

1py28vj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TMNT2012/comments/1py28vj/how_do_the_turtles_anatomy_and_biological_traits/,How do the turtles' anatomy and biological traits work? (This is long),"When I write fanfiction, I like to be as detailed as I can about the scene. Of course, the details that matter the most are the emotions that the scene creates, the environment, and the dialog. But adding details about a character's body and their biology can also be important.

The turtles got human DNA from Splinter. So their DNA is a cross between turtle and human. My question is how much do you think one end affects the other end? And how much do you think both ends conflict inside the turtles?

If you know about Irl turtles, you know its a toss up when you try and have *multiple* cohabitate together. Its not impossible, it just depends on *all* the turtles behavior and how they behave in the group you created for them. Some turtles are just more aggressive than others and so they may not stick with other turtles outside of summer. Raph is notably the more aggressive one in the family compared to his brothers. And lots of people chalk it up as 'he's just the hothead'. 'He has trauma over certain events'. Etc. Which, fair. But maybe his aggression also comes from his turtle instincts and that makes his outburst even more volatile. And teenage boys have a lot of testosterone running through them that can make them get aggressive or more irritable in certain situations. Not *all* guys are like this, but everyone does go through some kind of intense hormonal change as teenagers.

So we put natural turtle aggression that can come with incompatibility/stress with a group + human testosterone that arises with puberty = a hothead who can't fully understand *why* he's angry (which is Raph's excuse/explanation when someone confronts him about his anger. Its always 'you guys just don't get it!' Or he feels like even he doesn't know why he's so angry). Because he's got two things clashing in his biology. That's what makes me wonder, how much does the turtle DNA interact/conflict with the Human DNA inside the turtles?

It's clear that the turtles can process emotions, process speech, can go through trauma, can learn more advanced motor functions, in similar fashion to humans. So that must mean there was enough Human DNA in them to completely alter their brain chemistry, even adding a new part of it (I am drawing a blank of what that's called. I'm talking about the section of a human brain that processes these same things). So clearly, their human DNA overrides the turtle DNA in terms of their organs/brain function. But, while I say that, their bodies are more turtle than human, outwardly. They can retract their limbs entirely into their shells. Their noses look more like beaks/snouts. When their eyes go white, isn't that the show trying to pull inspiration from irl turtle biology? Where they have a translucent eyelid? So all of that overrides the human DNA somehow.

I also wonder, what do wounds look like on their bodies? For example, the Invasion. When Leo nearly gets killed, Of course we never see blood, we never see graphic injuries. In the show, the turtles only get bruises, broken bones, or cuts that are just black across their skin/plastron/shells. But let's take off the kid filter in this context. Leo's body should have looked FAR more graphic. The glass from the window alone should have been embedded in his skin, not to mention he BROKE the coffee table on his fall (he either broke that coffee table when he was thrown through the window. Or he hit it so hard, it got shoved out of its place. Both options would have done some damage on his body). Turtle shells are durable, but they ain't made of concrete. Leo's shell should have been almost cracked open. And lets not forget that The Shredder clearly slashed Leo across his plastron (i headcanon it to be across his chest, specifically). So what would those gashes look like? Would they only be deep enough to where you saw the broken plastron, and then blood and muscle? Or, was it deep enough that you could've seen parts of Leo's organs?

Which then brings the question, how do they patch themselves up? Their limbs are a easy question to answer. Clearly their skin is flexible and maybe only slightly leathery. So perhaps all it takes is a thicker stitching needle to patch up cuts on their skin. But how on earth do you patch up their plastron? Or shell. Especially considering their shells *must* be attached to their spines, based on how they move. Like, in the show we can chalk it up to 'cartoon logic' as to why Leo even still had a heartbeat through their entire drive to the farmhouse. But in this context, Donnie would've had to do everything he could to stop his brother from bleeding out in that van. So, lets say Leo needed more blood. Could the turtles be able to get blood from April or Casey? Or do you think they only have to rely on each other for transfusions?

1py28k5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1py28k5/difficult_relationship_decision_25f_32m/,"Difficult relationship decision. 25F, 32M","25F. Currently have a 28M bf who I have dated for 1.5 years and do really like him and is a nice guy. He’s taller and decently attractive. I moved to a new city where I knew no one and met him on an app when I was lonely. He has been good to me but I know and feel that we both know it is not for the long term. Up until recently I have had the plan to move back home to save money and I told myself I would break up with him at this point. Again he is nice to me and treats me well, but he is lazy, not a go getter, I don’t like his family or friends at all. We live about 45 minutes away from each other and never makes an effort to come see me or take me out and is always saying he needs to save money so we can’t go out or we have to split meals or events etc, we only see each other about once a week if I drive to him. A few months ago I met a guy who works in my building 32M (where I work is mostly older people except us) he started helping me with my work since I’ve only been here about 2 years and is good at his job. He just broke up with his gf about 6 months ago. I made it obvious I had a bf of course and before we started spending time together I was just making it clear of dislikes/likes of my current relationship and that it’s probably not meant for long term which I’m looking for and how I can’t date some one my age and the things I want, etc just through coworker conversation. Then we started getting coffees and lunches together, and texting each other constantly everyday, some deep topics and other things. And about three months ago we started spending a lot of time together at work on field projects and lunch, probably 4-5 hours a day, everyday and the conversations were so fluid on all conversations about relationships, wants, long term goals etc. about a month  we got dinner after work because we both were in the area after work and it was a nice time. Then he asked me to a second dinner (as friends) obviously he knew I have a bf. And as we were having dinner relationships came up and he said he would have asked me out already if I was single in the politest way possible not forcibly at all and we talked about it for a little but then went back ti dinner and ended up staying out until 2am just talking about anything and everything. Fast forward to last week we got dinner again and the conversation came up again how he likes me and that he thinks we would have a great time together in a relationship, except this time I agreed and we talked until 1am again but about details and questions we both had about each other for this relationship topic. I told him I really feel bad because I have a bf and again he wasn’t forcing anything at all and wasn’t bad mouthing my bf, but he knows we both want the same relationship and long term goals, how we both always want to see each other all the time. I really like him and know he can give me what I want in the relationship and have the same goals. It’s difficult because I was planning on moving home but don’t now mainly because of him and I told him that and his jaw dropped(not sure if this was as friends or romantically) I now have been gone a week for the holidays and have never wanted to be back this much before, idk if it’s because of him or not. I saw him mostly as a friend but that last dinner has me thinking about a romantic possibility. He’s very nice but confident, owns his own home and is financially secure and gentlemen like but also so funny also has a good friend group and support family.  only negatives are we are the same height and slightly less attractive then my current bf. Obviously this is a very difficult situation but he has been completely respectful and not pushy at all and not in considering a romantic possibility if we can talk more about it this week. I have never been in this situation before by having a bf and having a man actually pursue me the way he has been. I’m not one to get hit on very often and how this man is pursuing me is very positive and enlightening. He also told me that he has never pursued someone in a relationship and feels bad about it aswell but that he thinks we get along so well and would be perfect for each other. Again he’s made it clear that he doesn’t want me to cheat(I never would) and actually wants to build a long term relationship and sees my potential in everything we’ve talked about. What are everyone’s thoughts and think I should do or how to navigate this???",0,1766955354.0,dating,11,0.18,False

By Alexis Gallagher

Writing prompt: POV of a ghost

               A Ghost and His Dog

	There is a middle aged man named Gary who was walking with his Alaskan Husky dog named Bear along a river bank near Portland Oregon where he lived. It was a foggy rainy morning when Gary lost his footing along the riverbank and fell into the river where he drowned. 
   Now Gary was learning what he could do as a ghost. He was feeling like he could do a lot more being invisible, which has its downside. Learning to haunt people he was reading his new book 101 ways for ghosts to haunt people  for ghost dummies.  Gary was on a mission now, he wanted to find his dog Bear.  
  Gary enjoyed hanging out by the cemetery by the river where he could hopefully try and find Bear. Unfortunately he was having no luck.
  That's when he noticed two men  walking dogs. It was also a foggy rainy morning. 
  Little did he know that one of these men could help him find Bear. He decided for some reason that these two men would be perfect for him to try his hauntings on.
  It was a chilly, rainy, foggy morning in November when Gary saw Ben and Jim walking their dogs Charley, a chocolate lab, was Ben’s who worked as an English teacher at a local High School.  Molly, a husky, was Jim’s who worked as a personal trainer at a local YMCA. 
  This morning while the two men were out walking their dogs Gary decided to haunt them. The foggy weather made it better for him to haunt them. 
  Feeling excited about this Gary made some birds chirping sound that he knew the dogs would run after into the fog which is exactly what happened when he made a force of wind come along just enough that the dogs leashes were able to come loose from the grips of Ben and Jim’s hands.  The two men looked confused as to what had just happened and seemed to be trying to find the chirping birds the dogs had run after which of course were nowhere because he had made the chirping sounds.  Gary was enjoying the haunting chaos he had made with the two men and their dogs.
  For some reason Gary felt as if there was something pulling him towards Ben and Jim but he wasn’t  sure what it was. Maybe one or both of them would be able to help him find Bear. He would need to find a way to communicate with them somehow. He decided he would stick near the  two men and find a way to get them to help him find Bear.
  Gary went back to reading his book on hauntings for ghosts. Maybe there was something in here on how to communicate with live humans but how? 
       	          
                      ~//~

    A few weeks later Jim and Ben were sitting in a local pub having a beer after work.  Gary decided to try to communicate with them by playing with the electricity and moving objects around. 
   First he made the power go off and delightfully watched everyone in the pub stop whatever they were doing in confusion of what had happened to make the power go off. He watched people start to take out their phones and look up what may have caused this power outage.  While the power was out he moved the drinks Jim and Ben had closer to the bartender.  When he turned the power back on all the people in the pub were happy.  Meanwhile Jim and Ben were confused as to what had happened to their drinks and how they had been moved.  
  Well that was a good haunting but it certainly didn’t help Gary communicate with the men for helping him find Bear.  Feeling giddy with a bit of hestitation maybe he should try writing or drawing  something for both of them.  He decided to try and show them his obituary and leave it somewhere each of them would see it.  

    February 7th 2012
Obituaries:
 Gary Gallagher Born 1960 - 2012
Gary passed away recently by a tragic accident of  drowning in a river while out walking his beloved Husky dog Bear. 
He worked for a local newspaper and left behind a younger sister.

 He left his obituary in both Jim and Ben's kitchen so they were likely to see it.  Hopefully they would be able to help him find Bear.
   He watched the two men read the obituary confused as to how it got there and what it meant while looking around to see if anyone was around to have somehow put it there.  
  Gary was feeling a bit of hope with the idea that maybe he was finally getting close to finding Bear.
      About a week later when Jim and Ben got together for a coffee they both discussed how they had found an obituary for a stranger neither of them knew and were wondering how it ended up in both their kitchens.
     As Gary was watching their coffee meeting he heard them talk about the possibility of him communicating with them.
   “Do you think that maybe Gary is trying to communicate with us?” asked Ben jokingly
    “Only you would ask such a question, you're into that sort of mysterious stuff. I guess that's possible.” Said Jim
  Ben had to think about this.  “It was great catching up with you, I am going to think about this Gary ghost communication through some more.”
    “Sounds good, I will chat with you later.” Said Jim
   Gary was now hopeful that this communication would help him reconnect with Bear. He missed him a ton.  Bear was a great companion for him and they were always out for a walk together especially along the river bank by the cemetery and he would feed him chicken from a rotisserie chicken. He wondered where his dog was now and how he was doing.  
  As Ben was sitting at home contemplating this ghost communication of his he was wondering how he would communicate with Gary.  Supposedly Gary could communicate with him but how was he to communicate with Gary to help him with whatever it was that he wanted. 
  Ben called up Jim later with some ideas on how to communicate to a ghost.
  Gary was feeling frustrated as if nothing seemed to be working on communication with Ben and Jim to help him find Bear. He felt heartbroken and really missed his dog companion Bear. Feeling at loss as what to do next he went back to his spot by the cemetery overlooking the path in front of the river to think and just clear his head as much as possible.
  Ben and Jim were walking their dogs by the river. It was once again a crisp foggy weather and it smelled as if it could almost snow. Charlie and Molly hear a dog barking in the distance. Suddenly just like the last time they were there only a few weeks ago the two dogs ran off fast into the fog.
  Bear appeared in front of Charlie and Molly once they got deeper into the fog. The two dogs started howling.
  Looking up from his perch on the rock wall between the cemetery and the path, Gary could hear Charlie and Molly howling.  Something with a lightness to it appeared to start making its way towards him.  As it grew closer Gary became delighted. It was Bear! Bear had found Gary!  He realized that he never needed to find Bear. Dogs have a sixth sense and that's what helped Bear find Gary.
  Charlie and Molly ran back to Ben and Jim just as the fog started to lift. They noticed as their dogs were approaching a shadow of a man and his dog walking in the distance wave to them with a smile and then disappear.

1py25ut,https://www.reddit.com/r/SchreckNet/comments/1py25ut/hunting_ravnos_methuselah_last_seen_before_the/,"Hunting: Ravnos Methuselah, Last Seen Before the Week of Nightmares","My greetings and thanks to you, readers of this node, my name is Amira, of clan Malkavian.

Several decades ago a certain Ravnos came to our city. They were apparently tangled up in a greater plot that both they and the prince were embroiled in, so the moment the Ravnos's presence in the domain became known, the prince called a bloodhunt. I can't say I knew the details of what this Ravnos and the prince were involved with, hell even now I still don't know much, I was simply curious about Chimerstry and wanted to see it first hand, so I joined the hunt.

Now in fairness to myself, at the time I did not know they were a Methuselah. If I had known I would have stayed far away believe me, as when we found them, they cursed the entire coterie and twisted my senses. Sounds now feel hot where before they looked blue. Coffee smells like violin concertos, but previously it sounded like the keys of a typewriter, and so on.

It could be said that I fared much better after being cursed than the others of my coterie who joined me on the hunt. As my senses were already crossed on account of my already present synesthesia, so it didn't confuse me nearly as much as it did them. Even so, it is still profoundly violating to have had my senses twisted away from what I'm familiar with like that.

In the years since, I have tried my hand at learning Chimerstry in hopes that I could revert the changes forced on me. But it seems such permanent things are firmly in the domain of the Methuselahs.

This leaves me with very few remaining hopes. I must find the Ravnos who cursed me and my coterie, assuming they survived the Week of Nightmares, and get them to undo what they did to me. I am willing to offer generous compensation to any kindred on this node who can assist me in locating and dealing with the curse giver.

Thankful for any assistance -

1py252a,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_DarkWingCarter/comments/1py252a/buried_deep/,Buried Deep,"  The trees blurred past as I made my way down the dark highway, my only company the quarter lit moon and the occasional glint of a deer’s eyes bouncing back my headlights from their obscured position in the brush line. Not great conversationalists, but better than being alone with whatever radio ‘funny’ man that was on at 3am. Any distraction from some car lots Nickel Pickle Sale might keep me sane and awake. After all, I had been on the road for about 12 hours trying to get back home for the first time in 3 and a half years.

  I pulled in the old gravel driveway that I first learned to drive in at about 5am. My eyes burned, my ass felt like it was brittle enough to crack (again), and my bones felt heavy, but that all melted away when I saw the trailer door open and my mom and pop stepped outside in their pajamas with smiles on their faces to greet me.

  “My boy is hoooooooooome!” yelled my mother as she shuffled quickly towards me, her puffy pink slippers kicking the gravels up as she went.

  “Hey, Mo-” I started, but was interrupted as upon exiting my car she tackled me, wrapping her arms around my neck.

  All the while my dad just stood on the porch, a sly smile on his face, giving a slight wave. He had never been much for words, but just his presence there told me everything I needed to know about how he felt. He was a short, bald, and quiet man, but no other man stood as tall in my eyes.

  Once we finished our greetings, they walked me to my old room. It was exactly as I left it when I left for University years ago. I quickly put my things away, laid down, and drifted away in exhaustion induced slumber. Sleeping so deeply in my childhood bed, in the only place I would call home, should have been the most restful I have ever experienced, but something was off.

  My body felt restricted, as if some force was covering me. My chest tightened, lungs refusing to fill with air. I struggled, attempting to toss and turn, but it was pointless. It was if I was a million miles underground; the very earth crushing me into nothing but bone-meal and dust. As I managed to wriggle slightly the bedsheet underneath me bunched in turn, giving the feeling of worms attempting to burrow through my flesh, as if I was nothing but dirt in their path. Then it passed.

  I shot up, covered in a cold, clammy sweat struggling to breathe and focus. My lungs burned and I coughed hard trying to fill my deprived body with air as quickly as I could. After a few moments I calmed and checked the time on my phone. 6:49pm. I had slept a bit over 12 hours, so I suppose I broke even. I rationalized it must have been some sort of reaction to the tiredness that my body was so unused to that made me freak out like that.

  I connected to the WiFi and received a flood of messages. Upon checking them I saw a few of my friends from high school were inviting me to hangout since I was back in town. I hadn’t seen some of these people since I left years ago and as life goes, the friend group kinda drifted apart as we started our adult lives. 

  “Eh, why not?” I said to nobody in particular. “Let me call up Terry,”

  I scrolled through my contacts until I found Terry’s number, dialing him up. Thankfully he picked up on the 3rd ring.

  “Oliver, you there, you bastard?” Terry started without so much as a hello.

  “What’s going on Terry?” I asked, half knowing his answer already.

  “Ollie-boy, you know me,” Terry stated confidently. “Just got off work over at the junk yard, had me a few beers, thinking of going down to the Black Gold down in Hazard,”

  “Isn’t the festival late this year?” I asked, a bit confused. Usually, the Black Gold Festival was held in September, but it was already halfway through October.

  “Yeah, you weren’t here but we had some rough earthquakes last month,” posited Terry drunkenly. “Damn thing nearly dropped my truck on me when I was workin’ on the sonabitch!”

  “Weird,” I said puzzled. “I didn’t hear anything about it,”

  Terry belched so deeply, I could tell by the reverberation it smelled rancid. “That’s cause you were off trying to become some high falutin city slicker, Ollie,” he stumbled out.

  “Uh-huh, whatever you say, Terry,” I chuckled. “So, what time are you gonna be downtown? I can be there around 8pm,”

  “Works for me!” Terry exclaimed. “Gotta put on my good pants, then we’ll go drinking after,”

  “ Sure man, sounds good. Be there soon,”

  “YEYE!” I heard Terry shout, followed by a loud gunshot (aiming at what i assume to be his newly empty can of beer), and the call disconnecting. Good ol’ Terry, he hadn’t changed a bit in these 3 years. I honestly couldn’t wait to see him. He’s a bit stereotypical of a Kentucky hick, but not a bad guy.





  I pulled my beat up SUV into the crowded parking center just down from the old library. The streets were filled with family’s sharing sugary funnel cake, teens who ditched class to ride rides or listen to music, and, of course, the drunks. Those are my favorite. It didn’t take long to pick Terry out of the pack of booze-hounds; slurring out a Hank Jr. song with a couple of, presumably, strangers.

  “HEEEYYYY OLLIE!!!” Terry shouted. “Get your Yank ass down here and meet my pals,”

  ‘Great. I thought I’d get away with one drunk tonight,’ I thought to myself as I waved and made my way over.

  “Hey y’all. What’re you up to?” I asked, already knowing the answer.

  Terry gave a mischievous grin, one I was all to familiar with from his shenanigans in high school.

  “Welp, my buddies here got an idea for some fun,” he professed slyly.

  “Uh-huh. Is this fun legal?”

  “Well, in my professional opinion...” he trailed off for a moment. “Not if we don’t get caught!”

  “So probably not,” I laughed. “What the hell are you thinking of doing in the middle of a festival drunk?”

  The group snickered, as if the idea of whatever they had planned was too good to contain.

  “Well, boy,” said on older, hairy drunk who’s stench was as large as beer belly hanging over his belt. “Old man Miller stopped at the Lowes before stopping here. Got himself some manure for that vegetable garden that wife of his has,”

  “Okay and?”

  “And,” he said, getting back on track. “We’re gonna ‘borrow’ a few bags of that manure and mix it in with those freaky bastards coffee!”

  Laughter came from the drunkards, but I was a bit lost.

  “Bastards? Which bastards?”

  The laughter stopped instantly, them locking on to me like I asked them which nut they lost to cancer. A taboo, unspoken answer to a question that needn’t be asked. Terry scurried over to me, a bit pale.

  “Ollie, you don’t know about the Convent, do ya?” Terry asked almost in a whisper.

  “No?” I answered, a bit lost. “The fuck’s the Convent?”

  Terry slapped his stinky, musky hand over my mouth to shush me. “YOU CAN’T MENTION THEM TOO LOUD!” He all but shouted, earning us some puzzling looks.

  “Okay? Why?” I inquired, ignoring the volume problem that comes with increased blood-alcohol levels.

  “Ya see, Ollie,” he started. “About a year ago, this new nice looking Church opened at the mouth of the holler. They called it The First Convent of the Mountains, I think. We just call them the Convent, it’s easier.

  Welp, they started of normal enough. Looked nice, folk acted nice, smelled nice, you know, real preacher types, all of ‘em. You know how folk ‘round here are, they got curious. Come Sunday morning they try the congregation at the Convent ‘stead of their old church houses; only to find out THEY AIN’T CHRISTIAN!”

  ‘Oh no,’ I thought. ‘I’m about to get wrapped up in some South Will Rise Again/War on Terror bullshit,’

  “I know that look Ollie,” Terry said, reading my expression with surprising perception. “These people ain’t right. They’re fucking creepy!”

  “Terry-bo, there’s a lot of different religions out there. maybe some variety in the Bible Belt is a good thing,”

  “It ain’t like that! I know about Mormons and all that, but this ain’t that!” he said, grabbing both of my shoulders with an alcohol fueled strength. “These people have got folks I’ve known in all my 26 years on Earth as God-fearing Baptists praying to a goddamn mountain!”

  I shrugged it off. “People convert all the time. Maybe this mountain thing spoke to them more than Jesus? Remember when Kate from 4th period became a Buddhist?”

  “Ollie... I’m telling ya, it ain’t like that,” he said, the hurt in his slurred voice becoming tangible. “I don’t care what a mans religion is,”

  “Alright, Terry,” I relented, feeling a bit bad. “I still won’t put shit in their coffee, though, they haven’t actually done anything to me, so it doesn’t sit right. I’ll get us some funnel cake, my treat,”

  Not thirty minutes had passed since I excused myself and I was greeted by the sounds of groaning and the rancid stench of liquid feces and vomit, squirting like fresh lemonade on a hot summer. Terry and the others must have moved the moment I left. Fucking gross.

  Pretending like I had no idea as to what was going on, I went and got my funnel cake. It’ll kill me by the time I’m 30, but I haven’t thought that far ahead anyway, so what the hey? Upon leaving the table with my mountain of crystal diabetes, I heard a struggle. Sounds of a fight just a bit down the street, back in the direction I last saw Terry. I got that all too familiar sinking feeling in my stomach, like I knew what was going to happen before I pushed through the crowd.

  “Terry?!” I yelled as I started making way back, cake in hand.

  The scene was pretty much what I expected, as much as I dreaded it. There was clearly some sort of altercation as people, who I assume are Convent goers, were standing in manure and vomit above Terry and the drunks, who were on the ground, cut and bruising. Those not on the ground were being drug off by city police officers. I skirted the crowd, pushing towards Terry.

  “Terry, man,” I started. “The fuck happened?”

  He spat out some blood from his busted lip. “They knew it was us somehow, Ollie. Couple of guys started going crazy. Fucking meth heads beat the shit out of us, then the city kitties were on us like crack on a plumber,”

  At this point the police had Terry up and were leading him toward a nearby cruiser. Didn’t stop Terry from shouting some threats at one of the unconscious bums to really rack up those potential charges, though.

  “Jeb, you goddamn heroin addled fucker! I’ll let you hear a mountain next time I see you! THE MOUNTAIN OF GODDAMN BULLSHIT I’M GONNA PULL OUT OF YER DRUGGIE ASS TO STUFF THOSE FUCKIN DUMBO EARS, JEB! I FUCKED YOUR SISTER, BITCH!”

  Very Terry. Soon the scene was cleared of bodily fluids and bums, leaving just a few followers, me, and the half of my funnel cake I haven’t eaten yet. I wasn’t worried about Terry, not his first run in with cops and even though he isn’t eloquent, he can be a smooth talker when his ass is on the line.

  “We know you were involved too, Oliver,” a deep voice boomed behind me.

  I turned to see a large man, dressed in khakis and a polo shirt walking towards me. My only thoughts were ‘Oh shit’ seeing the hulking missionary in full stride.

  “N-n-not really. My friend was but I didn’t want any part of it so I went to get cake,” I hastily explained, motioning at my quarter of funnel cake on my plate.

  “Didn’t come warn anyone, though, didya?” the man scrutinized in turn to my excuse.

  “W-well, ya see, I-i didn’t thi-”

  The man smiled peacefully and held up a hand, freeing me from my stammering. “It’s okay, Oliver. All we ask in return for not speaking out on you’re complicity is for you to attend one of our Convents services,”

  “That’s it? Just one church service?”

  “That’s it, Oliver,” He smiled less like clergyman and more like a shark, smelling blood in the water.

  “I can do that,” I agreed, thinking that one church service is better than potential lawsuits or charges. “When and where Mr-?”

  “Pastor Williams, Oliver. Glad to meet you,” He produced a small card and wrote something on the back. “We convene Fridays at 6pm in Buckhorn. I’ll see you there, son,”

  “S-sure, see you then, Pastor,” I said meekly, accepting his business card with an address on the back. He simply smiled, waved and vanished into the crowd as I stood there with my empty plate.



  The rest of the week passed in a haze of anxiety over the impending service. Terry had managed to sweet talk his way out of his cell after only 2 nights of good behavior somehow, miracle worker that he is, and was adamant that I not go as I had promised I would, but I was a man of my word, so that Friday evening I put on my Sunday best and made my way to the address I was given.

  It was a small lot in the woods about a mile or so from Buckhorn Lake on a one lane dirt road. The church looked ancient, the white paint chipped and faded, kudzu vines scaling the building from its base to the tip of the bent cross on the steeple. In stark contrast, the congregation members were exactly as Terry described. Clean cut, suits and proper dresses, all in noticeably nice cars. With a deep breath I opened my door and exited my car.

  “I’m glad to see you made it on time, Oliver,” Pastor Williams said as he exited the tree-line, seeming almost to have emerged directly from the foliage itself.

  “Oh, uh, thanks. Glad to be here,” I lied.

  “Uh-huh,” stared the Pastor, clearly unhappy with the platitude. “You know, Oliver, there’s no point in lying. The Mountain is your home, it hears everything you say, feels heart speed up. There’s point in confessing to the womb that nurtures you,”

  With that the Pastor brushed past and entered the dilapidated building. Bewildered, Oliver followed him inside. The interior was just as ruined as the outside. Pews sat, broken and rotten, the pulpit was covered in moss and mushrooms, and the only light stemmed from the broken windows, glittering with shards of broken glass. Even the ceiling, I noticed, was being invaded by tree branches, their protrusions through the wall looking almost like the were holding the roof up.The most unnerving thing though, was that none of the worshipers or pastors were anywhere to be seen.

  “Hello?” I called into the damp darkness.

  No response came, into the building I inched forward, the water damaged floor boards creaking to the point I feared they would snap under my weight. As I slowly reached the stage the Pastor would usually take to deliver his sermon, something beyond strange tickled my nostril. A light smell of smoke, as if something was burning, was emanating from just beyond where I stood.

  In just a few steps I came to what should have been an indoor baptismal tank, but the solid steel staircase that should end at the bottom of the pool converted to newer looking wooden stairs that continued deep past where the floor should logically be. Deep in those depths came the smell of smoke and an almost invisible flicker of firelight.

  “Jesus Christ,” I huffed as made my way down the stairs. They wound down, deep through the Earth, lit only by small burning torches. 

  The stairs let out to a long hallway made solely of loose dirt and stones, like the Earth itself opened this path of it’s own will. As the path continued the ceiling got lower and lower, until I was on my hands and knees, compelled to continue for some reason I could not hope to understand. 

  *Go forward*

  The rocks cut my hands and I began to bleed.

  *Go forward*

  Roots caressed and tickled my body like a lover.

  *Go forward*

  My clothes rip and tear, stained with bloody mud and sweat as they peel off like layers of an onion.

  *Go forward!*

  The darkness began to give way to light.

  “Go forward, and you will be born again from Mother Mountain,” came Pastor Williams voice as I exited the tunnel.

  I was in a large room, sunlight beaming down from a hole in the ceiling. The Convent goers were standing motionless, all staring at my bloody naked body smiling, unblinking, soaking in the sunlight. The Pastor walked, almost like he floating, up to me and extended his hand. I took it, it was hard with a damp coolness, like a rock buried deep in the Earth.

  “I am glad you made it Oliver” he smiled. “Very happy, as today is the day you were reborn by our Mother Mountain. Can you feel Her?”

  I wanted to say he was crazy, but I could feel Her. That voiceless voice in my head, telling me I would be safe now. Her Will taking seed deep in my soul, penetrating to my core, feeding off my life. The life that She had given me. I am her child, but I am also her vessel.

  “What is happening to me?” I choked out.

  “Mother Mountain is giving you her blessing, child. It is up to you if you can handle it or not,” offered the Pastor. “Do you wish to accept this gift?”

  I stared blankly. I thought it was the dumbest question I had ever heard, as if some idiot genuinely asked what color the sky was at noon. 

  “Of course I want Mother’s blessing!” I exclaimed with the most conviction I had ever mustered.

  At my submission, the world went dark. I fell to the moss covered ground, but my soul did not stop with my body. I fell endlessly into the dirt, with every mile the weight of the Earth building on top of me crushing and grinding me into nothing but dirt myself.

  I am the soil. I feel the worm consume my flesh. I feel the gopher borrow tunnels through my bones. I feel the plants and trees suckling my life through my countless teats. I feel the farmer ripping up the surface of my skin for his crops. I feel the humans transforming me because I am not to their liking. I am an obstacle to progress, an ancient barrier. 

  There’s so much pain. I feel my organs exploding and expanding, my bones picked clean by scavengers and mushrooms, being used and ripped apart, sold for parts like scrap, but I am at peace with my pain. My heart is filled with a mother’s love for her children. I am Mother Mountain.",1,1766955109.0,u_DarkWingCarter,0,1.0,False

1py23sv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1py23sv,"Aladino Connecticut Robusto Review – Elegant, Balanced and Unexpectedly Rich","The Aladino Connecticut Robusto (5 x 50) is one of those cigars that quietly surprises you. Wrapped in a Honduran-grown Connecticut seed leaf over a carefully selected binder and Nicaraguan fillers, it isn’t just another mellow Connecticut shade smoke. Instead, it marries classic creamy smoothness with layered nuance and just enough character to keep you engaged from first spark to last ash.


Presentation & Cold Draw
Right out of the cellophane, the Aladino Connecticut impresses with a golden, silky wrapper that’s smooth to the touch, evenly packed, and seamless in construction. It feels solid but not overly firm; just right.

The cold draw offered gentle notes of sweet hay, cedar, and a touch of almond, with a hint of vanilla lurking beneath. The draw was perfect: neither too open nor tight, setting the stage for a relaxed but flavorful smoking experience.

First Third 
From the first puff, the cigar delivers abundant creamy smoke with a soft, buttery texture. Cedar and light toast form the foundation, while sweet cream and toasted almond rise to the forefront. It’s easygoing but precise; no harsh edges, just straightforward flavor.

There’s a mild white pepper spice on the retrohale that adds dimension without jumping out at you. The burn line quickly stabilized and held a tight, pale ash that spoke to careful construction.

Second Third
As the cigar progresses, the profile gains subtle richness. The creamy core broadens, revealing marzipan sweetness, light caramel, and soft baking spices. The cedar continues to anchor the blend, but there’s a welcome depth now; a whisper of nutmeg, honeyed toast, and dried fruit.

Body remains in the mild to medium range, but the flavors are layered enough to keep your interest. The draw stays effortless, the smoke continues to be smooth, and the burn remains even.


Final Third
In the final stretch, the character deepens slightly. Toasted hazelnut and warm oak come forward, while the sweetness mellows into a light honey nougat finish. The spice on the retrohale is still present but soft; more of a gentle warmth than a kick.

The cigar finishes clean and balanced. Even near the nub, it stays cool and refined, without bitterness or harshness - just a pleasant, lingering finish.

Final Thoughts
The Aladino Connecticut Robusto is a prime example of how a Connecticut shade cigar can deliver more than mellow simplicity. It’s creamy, nuanced, and well balanced, offering layers of sweet and savory notes that unfold over its smoking time.

Perfect for a 60–75 minute session with coffee, tea, or a light spirit, this is a cigar that will appeal to both newcomers and experienced smokers who appreciate a softer profile that still has depth.
Would I smoke it again? Absolutely. The Aladino Connecticut Robusto is a polished, approachable smoke that deserves a place in any humidor.",1,1766955022.0,cigar,0,1.0,False

It will probably be a long one, and all over the place at that, thank you to anybody who takes the time to read. Please no rude or callous comments, I am at the edge already, really don't need that. (I am safe and not in harms way currently)  I would very much appreciate any other comments, advice, encouragement, quotes anything that you wanna share

I don't know where to start or how to get this all into words. So much is floating through my brain, but its all jumbled.

* people suck / but at the same time am grateful for those who are kind and considerate

* angry all the time

* i think i want to quit therapy but I'm not that mentally well at all right now so that's probably the last thing i should do. Therapy tomorrow. 

To expand on these. Yes, i have thin skin. Yes, things people say bother me. I'm sorry, sue me. Its too much. It really is, and youd think I'd have grown out of this by nearly 30 years of age but I havn't. People make me cry and make me suicidal. I dont know why im bringing this up but whatever. Its just floating through my mind a lot.

The anger: I have been so angry. Genuinely just get set off by things. I'm usually in a pretty chipper mood, but something will happen, like somebody nearly killing me in traffic weeks ago and i was seeing red. People treating me with disrespect i just get so mad.

Its just been getting worse with age. It has been a thing. I wasn't like this as a teenager. Very ""shrug it off"" type. Would not gaf one iota about shit that pisses me off these days. 

Idk what to do anymore about that.

I guess I just am too uptight and serious maybe. I mean, you can't change anything with anger. Okay typing this out is kinda helping.

Now about quitting therapy. I hate myself for this so much, much more than you do, i promise so please dont shame me for this, and I know how wrong it is. Oh my god im starting to tear up. I know, I KNOWWWW therapists dont do this but i just want my therapist to encourage me to stay in therapy. I want to run so badly but more than that i want him to tell me to stay. Idk why. But i need this so bad.

Ultimately, i dont see myself being here after my parents pass. That has been my plan for a while. 

So maybe I shouldnt even try, shouldnt even waste a spot somebody else could take.

I'm not doing my therapy homework, I'm bad at answering thoughtful questions my therapist has, and sometimes I get really sad that I won't ever have anybody in my life like my therapist outside of therapy and i start overthinking during the session and i dont want him to think im not interested in what hes saying :(

Am I just being selfish by not quitting therapy? :(

I dont even know anymore bro

All i know is that right now i dont want to be here anymore. People suck, i hate myself. Life is hell. I'm literally just keeping myself alive for my cats and mom and dad at this point. But its so shitty, thats not living. I have problems brushing my teeth even I just dont give a fuck anymore. 

Had to drop a ""friend"" recently who was just a bully. It even comes from people i love and care about. (Going back to the whole, people are shit thing)

My therapist thinks so highly of me, is encouraging me to go back to school. Had a whole session arguing with him that I do not have the IQ for that. He thinks way too highly of me.

I wish i could just go in tomorrow for my appointment, curl up in a ball on his lap and just fucking bawl for an hour in his presence dude. I am so deadass.

I'm not doing this therapy thing very good. I have cut back on the drinking actually, so there is that. It got bad for a bit again but I've managed it better lately.

I'm always so sad when the hour is up in therapy :(( 

I'm also really sad I can't just share a 6 pack with him and bullshit.

Why couldnt I not have mental illness? I feel like its worth ending the suffering idk. I thought it would be easier to heal than this i guess. I really just....idk why try. This world is hell.

You know what else kills me? Under no other circumstance or posibility would my therapist and I be in each others' lives. Even if he had never become my therapist. He wouldnt think twice about me if he saw me in a coffee shop. He'd never be my friend. He'd never think anything of me like I would him. I think he's the bees knees and oh god I've literally been a mess the entire 6 months I've been seeing him.

Let’s get started:

OK card one card one you have a queen of cups the queen of cups talks about emotional maturity. There have been a lot of very slippery slope right now. Maybe you had a certain plan for a job or maybe for an apartment but for whatever reason things are being more difficult.

A lot of people could literally be sitting in front of a cup of coffee or you would be a really good photographer or something or like maybe a barista

You have a really intelligent mind and you need to go further with that. Also, some of you could be very religious or you used to be religious if you used to be religious maybe it’s the time you revisit that in a new mindset not necessarily to engage, but just to learn.

I also feel like you guys are very drawn to beauty aesthetic doing what’s best for you is what’s gonna make you win in your life if you want to get a surgery then you can get it if you wanna treat yourself every single day that’s what you need to do and you guys are actually a lot more private because you don’t publish things that you do you don’t need you don’t need to start publishing or flaunting the things that you have

Be proud of yourselves and know that over the next couple of weeks you’re gonna be gifted very particular items and they’re gonna be decorations, such as ornaments or like very specific ornaments that you’re gonna like

Social anxiety?

Let go.

Network with others and make content outside. 

——————————

Pile 2:

All right the next card is a five of pentacles

This talks about abundance money you’re halfway there you could be into science working out or something to do with a fanart or fanfiction there’s a lot of right here amongst the collective. Some of you could be older or you’re going to grow into someone that’s really really wise.

A lot of you also need to take more time to reflect you always take time and context when you’re meeting a person you don’t trust them at face value or just for what they say

You guys would be a really good healer whether that be through therapy work Reiki or maybe you’re a reader yourself tap more into your connection with animals and especially in your dreams figure out a way to control your dreams or at least being able to protect yourself in a certain setting for example like the ocean or any other place you would like and in doing so not only are you getting better at that school, but also it’ll kind of like discharge your brain

Because a lot of people are looking to stop being so overstimulated which you can’t depend on one thing because then it almost becomes something you’re too dependent on so apart from that adapt some sort of meditate practice or something else like coloring, drawing singing, dancing whatever

The last thing I can say is this pile was charged a lot when they were younger or they had a lot of trials in regards to judgment hate or like not being accepted for identity or simply four different beliefs rest easy knowing that there is a plan for you and you’re not even conscious of it, but everything that has been happening in the last three years has truly been for a reason, especially if you had faced any evictions any dramatic like fight that could’ve affected your career or something of that sort

Or even the loss of an animal I’m getting specifically cats like a white cat black cat or orange cats

And I also keep seeing the number 777

1py1xk1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_notrightnow98/comments/1py1xk1/coed/,Coed,"When I heard the college I got accepted to still had coed dorms, I was pumped. Not only because that meant I'd live close to some potentially hot girls, but also because hopefully I'd get to see them naked in the coed showers. I realize that the whole point of coed showers was to de-sexualize the human body, but to a guy fresh out of High School and with very little female experience under his belt (no pun intended) this was a dream come true. I did all my paperwork, got assigned my dorm and moved in. I was ready to meet new people and get naked with them for what would become my most memorable, adventurous years of my life. Wild and scandalous fantasies raced through my mind faster than cars at the Indy 500. My freshman year was the opposite of that.

While the dorms were coed, and I happened to live across the hall from a pair of cute girls, they kept to themselves, as did everyone on our floor. My roommate was a sports guy and never wanted to hang out. The showers were coed but there was an official schedule that most people adhered to. From 6am to 10am the women were scheduled for the top of the hour and men were scheduled at the thirty-minute mark. Any time after 10am was open to whoever. This meant that unless you went during one of the transitional periods your only shot at seeing someone of the opposite sex was during open shower time and most people were at class so that was a bust. Even if you were lucky enough to bump into someone worth looking at, they had almost always donned a towel by then. That's not to say I didn't catch a nipple here or there, but it was not the salacious porn fantasy I was expecting.

On the off chance that the stars aligned and someone attractive was in there with me it didn't matter. There was an unwritten rule that you stayed facing the shower head so that your back faced the traffic areas. When finished, you would grab your towel and cover up before heading back to your room, assuming you didn't change before you left the showers. As a horny teenager I tried literally every time slot multiple times. I wanted to find the absolute best time to 'accidentally' bump into cute girls. In reality, there was no best time because things just never got crazy. Maybe everyone else was just more mature than me and didn't want things to get wet and wild.

I wasn't entirely alone. The topic came up while my roommate and I were watching the infamous shower scene in Starship Troopers. We both agreed that it would be awesome to be as comfortable as they were, but neither of us had the guts to do much about it. Instead, we shifted to talking about the girls we thought were hot and would most like to see. My room mate had nicknames for the girls he liked. Usually something about their appearance because we didn't know their names and were too socially awkward to ask. Eventually I adopted some of the nicknames too, just so we had something to talk about.

A woman we called Triple B (busty, blue-eyed brunette) was my favorite. I had spotted her several times in the halls, a few times coming or going from the showers, but never had the nerve to talk to her. I realize in hindsight how idiotic it is to want to have crazy, unabashed sex with someone but not having the courage to speak to them. It's not my fault I was horny and terrified at the same time. Not that any of it mattered because it was all a dumb fantasy anyway, one that I was confident I would never experience. That didn't stop me from thinking about it though.

With careful planning I had arranged my schedule so I didn't have a class till 2:00pm on Mondays. This allowed me to stay up late on Saturday and Sunday without worrying about being tired. That time would have been great for extra credit projects or additional studies but mostly I just played video games. As such, I had gotten into the habit of waking up around 9:45am on Mondays and making use of the mostly empty 10:00am open shower time before I went to breakfast. Like many Mondays before, I woke up with my alarm at 9:45 and crawled out of bed. My roommate was already gone, which wasn't unusual. I grabbed my towel, my bottle of body wash / shampoo / all-around-man-cleaner, put on my flip-flops and flip-flopped my way to the showers.

The last of the 9:30am men were leaving as I arrived and I was alone, as per usual. It was kinda nice being able to shower in peace like that without some dude making prison jokes. The shower area had six stalls, three on each side of the room. Each stall had two walls about six feet high on either side and a shower curtain at the back. Being as tall as I was, I could see over the stall walls, but just barely, and usually not enough to get a glance at anything worth looking at. I went to the stall on the far left because it had recently been replaced and had the best heat and water pressure. I was told they planned on replacing the others at some point but it had been over a month and there was no progress.

I hung my dry towel on the hook outside the stall, pulled back the shower curtain and stepped in once the water was warm enough. Another benefit of showering later in the day was that I didn't have to rush. A long, warm shower was basically my cup of coffee for the day and if I didn't get it I was always cranky. I spent a few minutes just enjoying the heat as it poured over my body in a steady stream. To my surprise, I heard flip flops plod in after a few minutes. It wasn't strange to have someone else around when I was, but it was definitely uncommon. I didn't bother to check who it was, it's not like I was friends with many people on this floor anyway.

The squeak of a turning shower handle echoed through the room. About thirty seconds later it turned off. Odd, I thought. Maybe they forgot something in their dorm? I heard the flip-flops plod over, then another squeak, this time in the stall across from mine. My back was facing whoever it was, and I suddenly wondered if I shut the curtain all the way or if they would get a good look at my butt. Not that it mattered. That was kind of the point of a coed shower, to de-sexualize the human body. Roughly thirty seconds later the water behind me stopped and the flip-flops continued to the stall next to me. With a big glob of all purpose man cleaner, I lathered my head and beard, using the excess soap to cover my body. There was a squeak of a rotating shower handle and the rush of water in the stall next to me. As I lathered some soap dripped over my eyelids, forcing me to keep them closed.

""Ugh, seriously?"" a female voice protested, ""Is there no hot water? Did you take it all?"" the voice asked me, upset but clearly poking fun. I leaned forward and let the water splash over my face, trying to rinse the soap from my eyes.

""If you get here late, they sometimes run out of hot water. This one just got replaced, so it works great,"" I said, scrubbing my scalp and trying to clear the soap from my eyes. I felt a change in the water pressure and a faint spray on my face, as if someone had put their fingers in front of the shower head.

""Wow, yours is warm. Move over, I'm coming in,"" she said.

""What?"" I asked. There's no way I heard that correctly.

With my eyes still pressed shut I heard my shower curtain slide open behind me. Whether or not it was parted open before, she definitely got a look at my butt now. I felt a small hand push against my back, gently pushing me toward the stall wall to make room for another human in the enclosed space. I heard the shower curtain slide back into place and finished wiping soap and water out of my eyes. I was facing the stall wall with my back to whoever had just entered, but the fact that I knew it was a woman made my heart pound in my chest.

""Sorry to barge in on you like this but I have an interview in thirty minutes and can't go in smelling like a wildebeest,"" she said. Because of the close confines of the shower stall (and my uncommonly round butt) I felt us touching. It was brief, but we kept bumping into each other as we tried to fit together in the tiny stall. I still had no idea who it was but the fact that I was naked and lightly brushing against her was enough to send a rush of blood down south. Don't get a boner, don't get a boner, don't get a boner I thought, even going as far as to push my hips forward so my dick was pressed against the cold ceramic tile.

""You don't mind, do you?"" she asked, her voice as innocent as if she asked to sit next to me in class.

""Not at all,"" I said, though in my mind I was thinking holy shit is this really happening? Stay cool, she's just trying to clean up before her interview, don't be a tool.

""Does that wall have something interesting to say?"" the woman asked me.

""Huh?""

""You're, like, practically kissing the wall,"" she said. By the sound of her voice she was facing me, which meant if I turned around I'd totally see her, full frontal. I turned around, partially because I didn't want to look weird and partially because I wanted to see her naked. Mostly because I wanted to see her naked. Entirely because I wanted to see her naked. As I turned my eyes went right over her head and looked over to the next stall because of how short she was. I looked down.

""Triple B..."" I thought, but somehow the words came out of my mouth as a whisper. Standing in front of me was none other than Busty Blue-eyed Brunette. She had a perfect hourglass figure. Large, firm breasts that hovered above a tiny waist that swooped into thick hips. Sir Mix-a-Lot would have been proud of me. She looked up at me with those big blue eyes and ran both of her hands through that long brown hair, pulling it all to one side. Everything was on display and she wasn't even mildly ashamed. So hot. She looked down at her own chest.

""Triple D's actually. Triple B isn't even a size,"" she said as if we were discussing shoe sizes.

""My mistake,"" I said, trying not to drool over her. Wait, did she really say triple D's? I wasn't sure if that was a real size either, but with how large hers were I totally believed it. She looked down.

""Six inches?"" she asked. I couldn't help but laugh. It felt like she was ribbing me for calling her out on her bra size, even though I wasn't trying to.

""Give or take,"" I said, attempting to exude a confidence I definitely didn't have. I looked down and realized I was hard as a rock. I felt my face heat up with embarrassment. She didn't seem to mind.

""Well, which is it? Give or take?"" she asked and something about the way she said it told me we weren't talking inches anymore. She kneeled down. Holy shit, was she going to blow me? This could not be happening, there was no way my life could be going this awesome. She came face to face with my swollen shaft, the tip was pointed right at her and a few mere inches away, so close I could feel her breath. She stared into my eyes with the barest hint of a smirk on her face. With one of her delicate hands she reached down between my legs and... grabbed the bottle of all purpose man soap that was between my heels.

""I'll say give because we don't have a ruler to dispute it,"" I said.

""Smart man,"" she replied, squeezing a dollop of my soap into her palm and sudsing up her hair. Since I was already clean, I didn't really have anything to do. I assumed she'd probably not appreciate it if I started masturbating furiously in front of her, so that was off the table. Instead, I just watched. She spent a good deal of time on her hair, scrubbing her scalp thoroughly in a way that made her breasts jiggle ever so slightly. I stared. If she didn't expect me to look she wouldn't have climbed into the shower with me to begin with. Once she saw my eyes were fixated on her chest her soapy hands moved down her neck and to them. She lathered the bright white foam over her creamy white breasts. I felt my pulse pounding in my cock. Her hands slid down her body further, following the line of her hips before sliding over and between her thighs. She slid both hands up to clean her vagina, then allowed her fingers to slide back up her flat stomach and under her breasts, plumping them up before letting them fall into place with a satisfying bounce.

Good lord Triple B was hot.

Her hands slid up from her breasts and to her shoulders as she turned around. I watched as water and soap dripped down her petite, curvy frame. My dick was so hard it was starting to hurt. She finished her rotation so that her back faced me, glistening wet but soapless. ""Get my back?"" she asked.

""Absolutely,"" I said, stepping forward and putting out my hand for her to give me the soap.

""I think there's plenty on me already,"" she said as she dropped the bottle into the stall next to us and separated her legs about shoulder's width apart as she pushed her butt toward me, almost close enough to touch my raging boner.

I practically came right then and there.

I reached out and touched her shoulders, slathering the foamy suds down onto her shoulder blades and pushing my thumbs into the muscles on either side of her spine like a massage. Because her back was facing the water and water was splashing off of me, the soap I gathered from her shoulders washed away quickly. So fast that I didn't even have time to get past her shoulder blades. I reached around her body again, this time pulling a dollop of foam from her flat stomach and pulling it around to massage her lower back and work my way up her spine. She swayed her hips ever so slowly and let out a satisfied moan. It wasn't a sexual moan, more relaxed and appreciative, but it caused a rush of blood to my shaft anyway. I was so hard I thought my dick would pop like a water balloon.

White suds trailed down her body and over her curves, washing away and forcing me to get another dollop if I was going to keep cleaning her. I got brave. She hadn't responded negatively to anything thus far, so I had no reason to believe she would switch gears now. I reached around her ribs and slid my hands under her breasts, cupping them one in each hand. They were humongous and heavy. I mean, I'm a big guy with pretty big hands but they were handfuls of soft, firm boob like that I'd never felt before. As my fingers traced over her nipples I felt them perk up under my touch and she let out another moan. This time it was sexual.

I couldn't take it anymore.

I let out a stiff breath and gripped her breasts, pulling her body back into me so that her round butt sandwiched against my hard cock. She let out a bit of a surprised yelp, which turned into a groan as I released one of her heavy breasts long enough to line up the tip of my cock between her legs, sliding it over her body till I found what I wanted, and shoved the tip inside her before returning my hand to her chest. Her hands shot forward against the shower wall and I lifted my hips to penetrate her fully, staring down past her round butt and watching as my raging boner disappeared inside her. Holy shit was she tight.

""About time,"" she moaned, looking over her shoulder at me with a grin. I wasn't entirely sure what that meant, but I knew it was a green light. I kneaded her breasts firmly as I slid myself back far enough that only my tip was still inside her before reversing the motion and going as deep as I could. She gave me a mischievous grin as my pace quickened, pumping her impossibly tight vagina as best I could at our awkward angle. Not that standing doggy was a bad position, I wasn't going to protest, but our height difference and the small space made it clumsy. That wasn't going to stop me from having a good time though. I continued to rock my hips back and forth, working my shaft inside her over and over as I massaged and, if I'm honest, played with her magnificent breasts. She kept her hands on the stall wall, pushing away from it so my thrusting didn't press her against the cold ceramic. I felt my swollen balls slapping between her legs and was slightly embarrassed by them, but I wasn't about to screw up this opportunity.

I heard flip flops enter the shower area, accompanied by someone whistling Careless Whisper by George Michael. Thanks to my height I was tall enough to see over the stall. It was a guy I didn't recognize wearing a towel and spinning a blue loofah around his finger. We made eye contact as he stepped toward one of the stalls. I made no effort to slow down on his behalf. He raised an eyebrow, hearing the noises coming from my stall. ""Dude, beat it in your own room,"" he said, shaking his head at me. As if to prove him wrong, Triple B let out a moan and told me to go faster. The guy's eyes widened, then he grinned and gave me finger guns before turning around and leaving the shower area.

""You're incredible,"" I said, still working myself into this mystery woman despite the brief interruption. I was having the time of my life but try as I might I wasn't getting very good penetration, maybe two or three inches tops. It still felt amazing but if this would be the one and only time I ever got to do this I wanted it to be perfect. If nothing else, I wanted Triple B to remember me fondly and maybe want to hook up again. I slipped myself out of her and she immediately looked back at me as if to ask if something was wrong.

I released her breasts and placed my palms on her hips, turning her around to face me. I got lost for a moment staring at that beautiful rack, so long that she asked me what was wrong. I licked my lips and reached down, sliding my right hand down her left thigh and around to cup the back of her knee. I lifted her knee as high as it would go, keeping my grip to help her balance on one foot as I adjusted myself to enter her from this new angle. She understood what I was trying to do and eagerly worked with me to figure out logistics. We were two smart young college students and people have been having sex since the dawn of time, I was pretty sure we'd find a way to make it work. Try as we might, however, the angle was not working. The shower space was too tight, our height difference too significant for a one-legged standing bang. I kept pulling her leg in different ways, moving myself into different angles and manhandling my manhood to try and make it work but it just wasn't going to. ""Let's go back to how we were,"" she said. She could tell I was frustrated. Then I did something that surprised us both.

Maybe it was the adrenaline of the situation, maybe it was some sort of perk of being the horniest man on the planet at that moment. I reached down with both hands, grabbed her butt, lifted her into the air, and pressed her back on the ceramic wall as I lined myself up between her legs. She got the idea immediately and wrapped her calves around my butt while placing her hands on my shoulders for support. It took me a second to find it, but once I was lined up I shoved myself inside her balls deep on the first push, shoving my hips against hers hard and pinning her to the wall as I held her aloft in my arms.

Her jaw dropped and an adorable little squeak came from her mouth as she rested her forehead on my shoulder. I didn't waste any time before I started to pump into her again, this time with the entire length of my cock instead of just the first few inches. I felt her nails dig into the back of my neck and was pretty sure they'd leave a mark, but I didn't care one bit. My steady pumping quickly turned into thrusting, which before long turned to pounding. I was so damn horny I was going to bang her brains out if I had to. I felt her massive breasts shifting against my chest, a strange and wonderful sensation as they tried to bounce and jiggle, but were squished against me too tight to do so. 

She looked up at me with hungry eyes. She wanted it as much as I did. I looked down at her jiggling breasts, wanting desperately to hold them, but I knew I needed both hands to hold her up. In a way it made things more exciting. It fed my unbridled desire for something I couldn't have at that moment. I felt one of her hands slide down my back and grip my butt hard. Her teeth were clenched together as she looked up at me, giving my ass a smack like I was a horse she was trying to encourage to go faster.

I did.

Something interesting happened. I had seen this sort of thing in porn before but was realistic enough to know it wasn't common. As I sped up my pace, pinning Triple B to the shower stall and hammering the last few inches of my cock inside her, her face contorted. Her jaw slowly dropped and one of her eyes closed. Her grip on my butt and behind my head tightened and her thighs tensed up. This tension built with each of my pumps and grew until her head rocked back and she let out a long, gasping moan. Her thighs quivered and shook in my hands and I felt her vagina constrict around my shaft over and over. With my dick alone, I brought her to an orgasm. To say I was proud would be an understatement. I was ecstatic. Elated. I felt like a god.

I felt myself swell up even more, if that were possible, and knew my orgasm was close too. I put my forehead on her shoulder, panting down on her breasts and watching them move with my actions. The sound of our hips smacking together, our hungry moans, and the occasional booty smack were loud enough that you could hear us down the hall. Oh well, I thought. I wasn't about to screw up the best moment of my life with the hottest girl I'd ever seen because of that. Holding her aloft and pounding deep inside her I felt my legs wobble and my toes curl as a surge of pleasure welled up inside me. I knew I was at the point of no return. With a final burst of vigor I slammed my cock inside her as fast as I could, a gesture she seemed to appreciate, and my thick hot spurts of sperm filled her almost immediately.

With how wet it was and how wobbly my legs had become I didn't want to risk falling. I managed one final pump, pinning her to the wall with my hips. She rested on my twitching cock as my orgasm ran its course and continued to pump my seed inside her body. Her fingers gently scratched the back of my head as we both basked in the moment. Her legs were still wrapped tight around my hips and she seemed perfectly content sitting on my hard shaft as my sperm trickled out of her. We both opened our eyes at the same time and looked at each other, forehead to forehead. Her cheeks were flushed, and I smiled. She smiled back, caressing the back of my head as we both caught our breath.

""I'm Aubrey by the way,"" she said nonchalantly. I laughed out loud, which made my still hard shaft twitch inside her.

""I'm Geoff. Nice to meet you,"" I said back. She gave me a big grin and held up her hand for me to shake it. I did, then reluctantly set her back down on the ground, exited her, and let my tired shaft slap against my leg as it fell.

""Wanna hang out sometime?"" she asked, looking up at me with those stunning blue eyes.

""Yeah, I guess we could go to a movie or something,"" I said, playing it off as no big deal like she clearly was.

""Perfect! I'm dorm 409, come by any time,"" she said, staring up at me for a moment. She then quickly kneeled down and opened her mouth, taking my semi hardness into it effortlessly and sucking gently up my entire length until I left her mouth with a pop. After such an intense orgasm the additional stimulation was almost enough to make me keel over. She licked her lips, gave the tip a kiss and stood up. ""Well, I'd say you're all clean now. Have a nice day!"" I watched as she exited the shower, wrapped herself in a towel, and went back to her dorm.",1,1766954612.0,u_notrightnow98,1,1.0,False

First of all, good day to everyone. I am incredibly fond of TCM, and try to learn what I can despite being in a region with no available TCM practitioners and the like, so I ask you guys for some guidance on what you think may be the issue here!

I am a 26F, average weight (slightly above average but healthy range, although I’m prone to gaining but I lose quite easily if I try (stubborn belly and arm fat though). 

I used to have normal levels of pain, until I turned 17-18 and got to college, after which, almost each period, I vomit 1-5x on the first day. If I eat, I throw it up, if I don’t eat, I throw up water. If I don’t drink water, I dry heave like crazy. It feels like I’m an animal. The pain is quite intense but I do not take painkillers as I usually throw them up unless I time them in advance and also, I don’t wish to rely on painkillers if I am being honest, regardless of how silly it may sound. But anyway, I will throw it up anyway. On the first day, truly I am miserable, I cannot function even if I try. I have thrown up in public, regardless of time or place. Painful, weak, so crazy. 

I used to struggle to breathe on my first day too but that has improved. I eat homemade food, not fried, very low artificial sugar intake, no cold drinks except one slightly cold coffee a day (refrigerated milk, not iced). I get regular movement and exercise as well. I eat fruits almost daily, am not lactose intolerant (milk makes me feel amazing, on the contrary, and I seem to glow (my skin) when I eat a lot of cheese and cream?). I am however incredibly prone to depression despite my best attempts: I journal, meditate, exercise, go out when I can (but I am poor so I only do free things like going to the park). therapy is not an option due to finances. I also sigh a lot, as if there is always pent up air in my chest, but otherwise no breathing problems. I do have “plum pit” in my throat sometimes. I am generally a happy person when I am not in the depths of despair, but of course life makes that difficult to access- which is fine, but I thought I should mention my disposition if it’s of any relevance. 

My periods are regular, however, lasting about 5-6 days, and my cycle is around \~27-28 days. Also, from the 2nd day onwards, the period becomes normal and my symptoms are tolerable (although weakness due to the VIOLENT first day are present of course). 

My nutritional intake is alright but I am slightly anaemic which I take iron supplements for. Hormones seem to be okay, yet I have facial hair growth? Would like to know why that happens but I am at a loss, although I shall leave my guesses below. 

I surely have higher heat in my body, always have. I get angry and irritable in hot places, very hard to function like that, I even cry sometimes. Most likely Qi stagnation, as well as Yin deficiency, and perhaps some blood stagnation? 

I do not know whether I am correct as I lack any guidance, but please give me your thoughts if you wish, and if you are kindly able to give advice, I would be eternally grateful. Thank you, and have a happy new year. 🎊 ",1,1766954564.0,ChineseMedicine,5,1.0,False

People expect me to have takes on life and rent and coffee orders but what kinda grown ass adult doesnt eat vegetables or tomatoes or like… most sauces?? be so fr 😭

And its not even funny or quirky anymore its just embarassing. Going out to eat is lowkey stressful bc I’m scanning the menu like its a test and praying there’s ONE safe option that doesnt have tomatoes sneaked in or some sauce I didnt ask for. And yes before anyone says it — I do try things. I HAVE tried things. Over the years I’ve actually gotten way less picky than I used to be.

What I hate the most tho is when people criticize it. Like trust me I’m aware!!! You pointing it out isnt helping!!! I dont need a lecture about how my tastebuds will “mature” or how I’ll “grow out of it”. I already push myself more than ppl think but I genuinely cant see myself ever reaching a point where I’d be considered a normal eater.

To visualize how bad it is I made this picky eater chart:

red = absolutely not, no discussion

yellow = depends on mood / prep / vibes

green = foods I actually like

Seeing it laid out makes me look insane ngl but idk I’m trying 😭 I wanna be low maintenance. I wanna not have to apologize every time food comes up. I wanna stop feeling like a child ordering off the menu.",21,1766954447.0,PickyEaters,57,0.87,False

 We became real close during the last month of the relationship and continued to after going on a lot of 2 person ""hang-outs"" to coffee shops, hikes and her apartment. She is smart, competent and caring. We are very similar in taste and opinions and know each other like we have been friends for years. We have had a lot of deep talks and flirted with each other, mostly in a joking way, but she never expressed that she didn't liked the idea of us being a thing and we a very physically intimate with each other (touching, holding hands, laying heads on each others laps). We have a lot of chemist together and I really like her.

At the same time she asked me if a guy she talking to was interested in her and expressed that she wouldn't mind if he kissed her.

But I'm afraid she won't want me, because she is still friends with my ex and are still in classes together in Uni or that she will think i broke up with my ex to try to date her.

I'm also afraid this will ruin out friendship. She is the only person that I have that I feel understands me in at a deep intimate level.

My heart was already pounding. It was 9 AM, and I couldn’t decide what needed to be done. What if I had been hacked? What if it was Lana? She was a social-media buff; it could’ve been her. She might have asked one of her friends to hack into my account and mess with me. Just a harmless but idiotic prank.

I messaged her right away. I didn’t have much time left to slowly influence her into revealing the truth, so I confronted her.

“Hey… Lana, you need to stop doing this, okay?”
Her reply came instantly...

“What? What are you talking about?!”

“Hey… look, I know you guys are playing a prank on me. Please stop. It’s too much now,” I replied.

“You’re crazy. What prank? What are you even talking about?”

Her responses sounded genuine. I didn’t know if I should continue, because her denial would mean it was someone else, and that would be concerning.
I didn’t reply to her at all.
It was already around 9 PM, and I had to leave for the gym.

My gym routine involved an hour of cardio and some time with the dumbbells.
I had purposely chosen a gym that had fewer people coming in, and even then, my time slot was 9 PM onwards. By then, almost everyone leaves.
There were only two of us at first, the owner, who was partly asleep, and me.
But wait… three.
I saw another guy.

The guy wasn’t up to anything. He just stood there like he had no idea what needed to be done. I couldn’t see his face because of the glass that separated us. He looked quite well-built, though, and that made me believe he probably didn’t even need to work out.

Then I heard camera click sounds. The guy was probably taking selfies. I looked through the glass; his flash pierced it several times.
A while later, when I was doing cardio, I got to see his face.

He looked slightly familiar, but horrifying. Quite otherworldly.
What intrigued me was the fact that I was looking directly at him, but he behaved as if I wasn’t even there. Perhaps he didn’t like being gazed upon.
Then he turned around, stretched his arm upright, and started taking selfies.

I wasn’t in the mood to go home at all. I was worried for my safety; the thought of finding someone inside my house was concerning. But I had nowhere else to go either. I couldn’t avoid going to my own home.
I left the gym by 10:30. The other guy had already left.

At home, I was terrified, concerned about what was going to unfold. Yet, I still logged into the Thamior account to see if I could get some clue, if Lana had finally agreed or was giving hints that it was her all along, playing the prank.
Right after logging in, I opened the messages section.
Lana had blocked Thamior.

I didn’t expect that from her. She could’ve just refused to reply at all.
Then I accidentally clicked on my own profile, and it sent multiple chills down my spine.
Thamior’s profile picture had been changed.

And in the picture, it was him at the gym.
I was right behind him on the treadmill, photobombing his photo.

I didn’t know what to do next.
Now I didn’t need any answers from anyone. I was sure that Lana hadn’t done it, and my account wasn’t hacked either.
How did the guy look exactly like the one I had created?

Yet still, I was certain, if Thamior had invited Sophia to my place, then he would definitely come.
I locked every single door, window, and any kind of opening that could let someone in.
It was 10:54.

They were going to arrive within six minutes.
Six minutes later, I didn’t hear anything. No noise. No doorbell. Just nothing.
I kept waiting.
An hour went by.

I was kind of happy. I let out a mild laugh, because I was almost sure it was turning out to be a mere prank.

But before anything else, I opened the laptop to check for recent activity.

There was a message from Sophia:

“Can’t come tonight. I’ll let you know if I get the time tomorrow.”
There was no reply this time.

“And that means Lana had been playing a prank all along. When I confronted her, she chose to block me. She’d hacked my account. Silly me,” I laughed, saying this to myself.

Then I entered the bathroom to take a shower. I had forgotten to take one after coming back from the gym.
After five minutes of refreshing and relieving shower time, I came out.
I sat on the sofa and opened the laptop to watch some Netflix.
But then the open tab in the browser caught my eye.

The [REDACTED] site was still open.
Sophia had been replied to, just two minutes ago.

The reply read:

“Had a tough workout session at the gym today. See you soon, honey. I’ll pick you up. Now I’m gonna go enjoy my coffee.”

My body froze.

I had just come out of the shower. There was no way someone could’ve replied to her on my behalf. The doors were locked too.

Then I heard the clink of a mug against the counter coming from the kitchen.",4,1766954316.0,nosleep,1,0.83,False

1py1r8s,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1py1r8s/im_having_difficulties_finding_reason_to_stay/,I'm having difficulties finding reason to stay alive.,"Hi. Sorry in advance, english is NOT my first language but I hope my post is coherent.  
Just to know this is a huge step for me because I never actually admitted that I have depression.  
I had a pretty rough childhood and adolescence facing my mother alcoholism and my father temperament and eventually I lost my mom at age 19 after years of hospitalization (neurological problems).   
This year after enduring my second burnout (4th overall in my life but 2 were never officially diagnosed, age 15-19 and 25) I had the courage to go back to therapy for the second time in my life. First time I stopped because my latest ex taught I was better off.  
I decided to go really honest explaining all my hopelessness, how I was feeling sad and depleted. I started February addressing also that I have the suspect that I have ADHD and that in the past I suffered heavily from anxiety disorder and OCD and anorexia.   
I was diagnosed first this year with burnout mental and physical (my body took a real hit) then with CPTSD and then depression. I always suspected I was depressed tbh. I also made an assessment for IQ (which resulted that I am indeed gifted) and hypersensitive.   
I was using heavily thc early this year to make it and I stopped in july and tried with Cipralex (escitalopram) which was a huge no-no because even at the lowest possible dosage made me lose 6kgs in two weeks triggering back my ED so I had to stop.   
I lost countless days at work, almost got fired. Lost a lot of friends. Almost lost the relationship with my father (I never told him anything of this).  
I'm tired. Therapy seems usless, even when I'm honest and open on the fact I don't really enjoy living anymore.  
I have trouble sleeping and everything that I used to love.. it's just..  I don't anymore.   
I feel like everybody would be just better off without me and when I try to speak it with friends the answer is always something like ""oh you're being drama again"". And now with festivities I'm self-isolating even more. It's not that I'm not trying.. I keep reaching out but it feels.. impossibile to even organize a simple coffee.

I'm scared because everytime in the past I found myself in similar positions.. I never actually tried to get better and this time I'm really trying. I eat healthy, I go daily for walks outside, I'm doing yoga, reading books, manifesting.. I'm so desperate I got even into criytals therapy and sounds baths and a lot of others bizzare things. And therapy. I'm doing so much therapy.. and.. I just seem to get worse to the point that my boss asked me if I don't wanna change therapist (which is difficult becasuse all the therapist in my area, which is not huge, have waiting lists). 

I'm scared. I just want time to pass fast so that.. I don't have to endure so much pain. I go to sleep praying that maybe I don't have to wake up anymore and if I do just to have a gentle day.  

I don't really know why I'm writing this. Maybe just to put it out. I want my life to get better but it's never eneugh, it's never the right direction, it's.. not eneugh. And I don't know what to do anymore. I don't wanna die.. but I don't wanna keep living like this anymore. I miss my old self, the one that.. had hopes and dreams and.. courage. Now I'm just.. broken.  
I know that people have it worse..and I feel so ungratefull.. but I'm trying.. I'm trying so hard. And I'm so tired and out of reasons to keep fighting.

Thank you for reading.

1py1pfk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1py1pfk/pain_from_coffee/,Pain from coffee,"Hello everyone. This is my strange story and I’ve always tried to find answers but to no luck so here I am looking for opinions. (I’m a healthy 48 male 180 pounds with no medical history and I’m adding this because my last post was removed) 

When I was a teenager I would wake up after sleeping an hour or so with this pain in my abdomen area. I would have this urge to pee and after going to the bathroom it would feel like my bladder wasn’t completely empty and I could feel this pain from under my testicles all the way up to the middle of my abdomen. It wasn’t consistent. I would suffer a few times a month then nothing for months at a time. It would last roughly an hour and I’d be completely fine afterwards.

I went to the hospital and they’ve done STD tests all the way to ultrasounds and barium enema. Everything has come up fine.

Fast forward and I’m in my late 30’s living with this condition that still affects me. One day I got the flu and I couldn’t eat for a few days. First morning I felt better i decided to make coffee like I always did my whole life. After 5-10 minutes I started experiencing these pains. The next morning having coffee again the pains returned immediately. These pains i would normally get at night started while having coffee. So obviously I stopped drinking coffee and all the pains have stopped since. Once I had a coffee crisp and experienced pains since it contains coffee beans.

I’m posting this because I’d like to know what’s going on. I started drinking coffee as a teenager and I’m in my late 40’s now and haven’t had pains since the coffee crisp but I still think about and miss coffee. Any insights would be appreciated.

1py1p5p,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1py1p5p,Total Drama World Tour Rewrite Special: The Search for Alejandro and The Beginning of the New Generation + the song for this special,"The special begins where Hawaiian Punch ended, with the contestants reuniting with their families. Beth's parents hug her worriedly, telling her that at least she was the first to be eliminated, and then Beth's brother jokes that he told Beth she wasn't ready for a serious relationship. 

Meanwhile, Harold's mother tells her son that she admires how gentlemanly he is with women, and Harold's younger sister tells her brother that he was amazing even though Harold stood out more in the Aftermaths and as an assistant than as a contestant himself. Harold's older brother, however, did not want to come and greet him, but his mother forces him because he must get along with his brother, so both Harold and his older brother hug awkwardly. Harold's father did not want to come either.

Geoff's parents happily reunite with their son, and to celebrate, they are going to have a party, but Geoff's four younger siblings jump up and down with excitement when they hear that word. Katie and Sadie's mothers obviously hug them, requesting them never to separate, and Sadie's younger sister, Cindy, asks her sister to promise never to fall in love with Justin again.

Leshawna's parents request her to punch Alejandro in the face next time instead of slapping Heather, which Leshawna promises to do, and when Leshawna sees her cousin Leshaniqua, she goes to hug her.

Then DJ's mom arrives and hugs her son, happy that he is free of that collar and that he had the courage to stand up for his values and expose Chris's truth. DJ asks his mom if she has something for his neck, to which his mother responds that DJ's brothers are eagerly waiting for him, with something for his neck.

Izzy's mom starts rubbing her head, but Izzy tells her it's okay, because at least she didn't end up like Lindsay and Courtney. Izzy's older brother tells her she could have died, but Izzy doesn't care and says that even despite the “big twist,” she'll come back as many times as she wants, and if the whole world must burn, she'll burn with laughter as Izzy laughs and screams maniacally.

Lindsay's dad asks Lindsay how she managed to connect with that homeschooled boy named Ezekiel, Lindsay's mom tells her to treat Ezekiel well and not let him be manipulated. And Lindsay's two sisters tell her that her friendship with Zeke and her relationship with Tyler is so adorable.

Ezekiel's mom and her son introduce themselves, and the two moms immediately connect as friends, both emphasizing how beautiful the friendship of Lindsay and Ezekiel is. However, Ezekiel's dad arrives and scolds his son for wearing makeup in episode 2 and for hanging out with an airhead.

Ezekiel's mother tells her husband that this is no way to treat people, but Ezekiel's father says that since Lindsay's family is probably upper class, they will look down on them. Lindsay's father says he will not treat Zeke's family badly, and in fact, he will help them achieve stability.

Ezekiel's parents are surprised by this, and Lindsay's family promises to help them have a stable life by offering them better-paying jobs. Lindsay hugs Ezekiel, telling him how much she appreciates him, and Ezekiel is very happy.

Noah's parents tell him that they chat with Owen's parents, and they are happy that Noah has such a loyal and fun friend. Noah says he already has a crazy friend (Izzy), a strong friend (Eva), and now he has a fun friend (Owen). Noah admits that Owen makes him smile whenever he can. 

Upon hearing this, Owen goes to hug Noah, telling him he is the best friend in the universe. His parents are touched and tell Noah that his eight little siblings (four boys and four girls) will come and hug him. Owen is surprised that Noah has so many siblings, to which Noah says that he is the youngest of the siblings, which surprises Owen even more.

Noah says that half of his siblings were born in India, but the other half, including him, were born in Canada, which surprises Owen so much that he faints. His parents and his two little brothers go to Owen and wake him up with coffee.

Sadie sees Owen's mom and says she looks a lot like her, to which the mom says that Sadie seems to be a version of her from the past. Trent's mother starts brushing his mouth, telling him she's going to clean his mouth so that the kiss Courtney gave him against his will will be erased, and Trent's father promises his son he will get a restraining order against Courtney.

Courtney's mother defends her daughter, but this causes an argument between her and Trent's father. Courtney's father tries to calm the situation, but is immediately pushed aside. Gwen's mother misses her very much and tells her she will put her in therapy, to which Gwen responds that she definitely needs it.

Gwen's brother promises he won't let Courtney hurt her and tells Gwen that the next time she sees Courtney, she should ignore her. Courtney's dad is worried about what his daughter has become, but her mom isn't concerned because Courtney inherited her winning mentality, even though her dad didn't want Courtney to develop an abusive mentality.

Meanwhile, Ezekiel's mom is proud of him for making so many friends and tells him that he will grow up to be big and strong. Ezekiel's dad admits that he is proud that his son is strong, and then Ezekiel goes over to Justin to hug him. Justin's mom scolds Justin for what he did to Katie, but she forgives him because he apologizes and hugs him.

Eva's parents tell their daughter that she is a champion, but Noah, Izzy, and Cody approach, saying that Eva is more than that. Izzy says Eva is amazing, Noah says Eva proved herself to be more than she was, and Cody says Eva is more than a friend, she is his protector, which moves Eva's parents.

Meanwhile, Duncan's mom hugs him, telling him she missed him a lot. Duncan asks her if she's mad at him for what he did, and although his mom condemns what Duncan did, she says she's happy that Duncan has become responsable. 

Duncan's dad asks how he can continue to live peacefully after the love triangle, to which Duncan's mom says that he took responsibility for what he did, apart from agreeing with Gwen to just be friends. Gwen comes up to Duncan and tells him that she will invite him to her house today, assuring him that he will get along with her brother.

Duncan's mother tells him to take care of himself, and Duncan says that an adventure is more fun if it smells like danger. But when Duncan's father goes to Courtney's father, Duncan tells his mother that he will take care of himself and goes with Gwen.

Duncan's dad tells Courtney's dad that he should be stricter with his daughter, because young people lack discipline. It's okay to treat your children well, but there are times when you have to discipline them. Bridgette's mom hugs her, telling her how proud she is that her daughter has grown as a person, saying that she is an example to others.

Bridgette's dad tells Bridgette that they have a surprise for her. Her brothers made her a banner that says “To the best big sister.” Bridgette almost cries and hugs her brothers (the oldest is named Wallace and has the same hair color as his sister, but he has black eyes; he is the middle brother. Her younger sister looks like Bridgette in Dramarama, but her name is “Brittany”). 

Meanwhile, Tyler's dad tells his son that he is the best on the planet and that he regrets putting so much pressure on him, to which Tyler says it's okay. Meanwhile, Tyler, Ezekiel, and Lindsay's moms rave about Tyler himself.

However, Sierra is worried when her mother tells her they need to talk, which makes Bridgette follow them. Cody's uncles go to see their nephew. Cody doesn't understand why his parents didn't come to pick him up, to which his uncle tells him that his parents forgot to pick him up.

This makes Cody angry, and he tells his uncles to take him home now. Meanwhile, Heather has an awkward conversation with her parents. They ask her for some money, but Heather refuses, telling them that now that she finally has the million dollars, she is not going to deal with her parents anymore.

Her parents continue to argue with her, and Heather's mother tells her to leave, but that she won't receive any money from them and they won't send her birthday cards.

Then Harold defends Heather, saying that Heather doesn't need bad parents like hers, that she changed, evolved, and learned to improve herself, and now that Heather has earned money, that's when her parents are finally starting to show her affection.

Heather says that Harold is right, and now that she has won a million dollars, she will finally be free and leave home, at which point her parents leave in anger. Then Heather sees Alejandro's parents, who are worried about their son.

The mother asks what happened to her son, to which Heather says that unfortunately, her son apparently... died. Alejandro's mother cries, and his father says he will sue the program, but Heather tells him that he can't because of the contracts, which makes the father sad. 

José says that's good, but then Carlos tells José that it's no wonder Carlos prefers Alejandro over José, because Alejandro still has humanity, while José remains in his fantasy world. The father tells José that even though he is his favorite of the three brothers, he has gone too far. 

Meanwhile, Chris continues to torment Alejandro, who says he will escape from the Drama Machine, but Chris mocks him and sings a version of Lemon Demon's Cabinet Man. Meanwhile, at Courtney's house, her parents argue.

Courtney's mom says Courtney didn't do anything wrong and was just playing the game, but Courtney's dad says what Courtney was doing was playing... but with the trust of the people around her.

Courtney's dad tells Courtney that her behavior is unacceptable and that she will have to change if she wants to have friends. For now, Courtney is grounded, which makes Courtney go to her room angry.

After that, Sierra's mom starts scolding Sierra for what she said during the season. Sierra says she's sick of her mom favoring a stranger over her. Sierra wanted to be cared for, she wanted to be treated with respect, but her mom gave her the worst upbringing possible.

Sierra concludes that her mother and Chris are perfect for each other because they're both monsters. Sierra's mother tells her that no one insults Chris, and she is going to do the same thing Chris does to his intern when they disobey him, which scares Sierra.

Meanwhile, Cody gets angry at his parents for forgetting about him, to which his parents say they don't care. Before Cody was born, they were happier, but now that he is here, their happiness is gone. Cody gets angry with them and tells them they are the worst parents in the world, to which his parents still ignore him, and then his mother gets up.

She tells Cody to leave home, because in this house, he will be ignored for a long time, so his uncle tells them that he will take care of Cody until he turns 18. His parents reach an agreement with his uncle and then tell them that the move will begin in a few days.

Then we see Bridgette walking, and when she was walking, she found Sierra herself crying on the floor. Bridgette comforts her and asks her what's wrong, to which Sierra says that her mother kicked her out of the house, started throwing her things in the trash, and her mom ended up locking the doors on her.

Bridgette comforts her and tells her that she's going to help her because, to Bridgette, Sierra is like a sister. After that, we see Heather packing all her things, ready to leave home once and for all. The taxi takes her to an apartment where she will be staying temporarily.

Bridgette takes Sierra to her house and tells her that this will be her new home. Bridgette's family welcomes Sierra with open arms, and Sierra tells them everything that happened. The family is shocked by this, and they tell Sierra that she is welcome in their home. Sierra asks how they will make sure her mother doesn't get away with it, to which Bridgette's mother says she will do something.

Meanwhile, Tyler is in bed, thinking about Alejandro, distressed about what happened to him. Then Tyler leaves his house and someone appears who says he can help him. Tyler doesn't know who he is, but that person calls himself “Alex.”

Alex says he was Chris's intern, but Chris himself kicked him out because of something that went terribly wrong, in which Alex ended up losing an arm (his right arm), and now all he wants is revenge on Chris for what he did to him.

Alex tells him he can help him find Alejandro, telling Tyler he has a private plane, and Tyler must tell everyone, to which Tyler agrees and tells Cody, Owen, DJ, Lindsay, and Ezekiel, although he tells them by phone. Everyone spreads the message to all the contestants and they all go to where Tyler said the meeting point would be.

Meanwhile, everyone's parents are asleep, but Sierra's mom receives a letter and reads it. Then Alex tells everyone to get on the plane, and they all get on. Ezekiel asks where they are going, and Alex says they are going to Drumheller, because that is where Chris's secret base is, and then the plane begins to take off.

Noah says that at least this plane has better amenities than Chris's, and Eva agrees with him. Among them, Courtney is the only one who questions whether they should trust Alex, but she knows that someone must stop Chris now.

Meanwhile, Justin tells Ezekiel that he is going to be a new member of the Drams Brothers. Ezekiel is very happy about this, and Trent, Cody, and Harold welcome him.

Gwen asks Alex for information, which Alex agrees to give her. He explains that he used to be an intern because he had to support his family somehow, but this season, Chris reached his most evil point, so anyone who disappointed him was fired. Alex was fired because Chris got angry with him for refusing to use animals as test subjects.

However, Alex took this as an advantage, and since that day, he has devised a plan to help them defeat Chris. Gwen asks him how they are even going to do that, to which Alex says that since he was Chris's intern, he already knows how to track him down and go after him.

Then Bridgette gathers everyone, telling them that if they do it right, they will be able to end this cycle of eternal suffering. Even though they all have their differences, they will be able to do something together, and that is to put an end to Chris McLean's tyranny.

Meanwhile, Chris can be seen hitting a metal rod against the ground, causing high-frequency sounds that disturb Alejandro. Chris tells him that this will be Alejandro's “little punishment” if he dares to leave the Drama Machine.

Alejandro doesn't know what to do. He is too distressed, and Chris continues to torment him by manipulating him, telling him that he will give him all kinds of comforts, such as good food, good hygiene, and a good home... only for Chris to laugh at this proposal and leave while Alejandro cries.

Then the plane finally lands, and everyone gets off, but Alex says they now need a distraction to get the guards protecting the entrance to leave, so Katie and Sadie have an idea, but they need three things: outfits, makeup, and romantic music. No one understands what they're saying... except Lindsay and Harold, and after a 10-second scene, Katie and Sadie are now dressed as mean girls, and they both go up to the guards (who are interns the same age as the campers).

Katie says that there seems to be a new attraction called “The Power of the Louvre,” but unfortunately, they don't have any boys to go there with. The interns guarding the entrance offer to go with them, but only because they want to stop guarding the entrance because they are tired. So the boys go with Katie and Sadie to this “attraction,” which is actually a distraction.

The contestants enter and see that they can't continue, so Alex tells them they need to pass four levels to get to where Chris is. The first level consists of solving an Egyptian puzzle that opens the way to two entrances, both related to water. The easy one is to go by boat while dodging all kinds of attacks from passersby. If they manage to do so, they will advance to the second level, but if, on the contrary, they decide to swim down using pumpkins as helmets to avoid drowning, the reward is greater, as it gives access to the third level immediately.

Those who will go by boat are Alex, Beth, Leshawna, DJ, Lindsay, Noah, Owen, Ezekiel, Justin, Duncan, Sierra, and Cody. Bridgette tells Cody and Sierra to take care of themselves, Tyler kisses Lindsay before they go their separate ways, and Noah tells Eva and Izzy good luck.

Those who decide to swim are Harold, Geoff, Izzy, Trent, Gwen, Courtney, Eva, Bridgette, Tyler, and Heather. Those who go by boat are led by Cody, but several interns with paintball guns start attacking them, and Noah jokes that they use paintballs so they can use guns.

Owen and DJ offer to be shields for the others, and Duncan comments that the shooters have worse aim than the Slurmtroopers (a parody of the Stormtroopers). Meanwhile, the swimmers successfully reach the third level, although it took them a long time to get there, so when they arrive, they wait for the others. 

The others reach the second level, where Alex explains that they must go through a path where they must first dodge attacks from katanas, then poles, then avoid sausage meat falling on them, and also dodge animals, and then perform a stunt on a giant surfboard, while at the same time scoring a goal. No one understands anything, to which Alex says that everyone must contribute.

Noah tells everyone that he knows how to dodge, so they should follow his movements to avoid being attacked by the katanas and poles. When they reach the poles, Leshawna slaps them hard, pushing them away from the others. When the sausage meat is about to fall on top of them, Owen uses his mouth to eat all the meat.

Beth tells them that they now have to be careful with the animals, so she tells DJ to distract the animals while she comes up with a plan. DJ takes care of the animals while Beth figures out what to do. That's when she sees a bag of peanuts in Ezekiel's pocket, so she asks his permission to use it, and Ezekiel allows her to.

Beth then throws the bag to scare the animals away, and it works. Now they are on the surfboard, Justin leads them, and now someone must score a goal. Duncan takes charge and shoots a powerful shot, which manages to enter the net, and everyone celebrates as they are ready to go to the third level, but Sierra realizes that someone is following them.

Meanwhile, Heather and Tyler think that if they defeat Chris, they will not only avenge Alejandro, but also those who suffered at Chris's hands. Still, Geoff asks Heather what will happen if they fail, to which Heather looks down and responds that she doesn't know.

Of all of them, Courtney is the only one who doesn't trust Alex, because she can't stop thinking about what would happen if Alex is just trying to trick them and is actually still working for Chris. Izzy says that if what Courtney says is true, then it will be the biggest plot twist in history. 

Gwen says she can understand what Alex is going through. As Chris's intern, he must have witnessed all the horrors Chris could do. At least he was able to quit, but he must have been left with trauma that is difficult to erase. Trent says he hopes Alex isn't lying, to which Eva says that if it's true, the person behind all this will pay.

The others meet up with the rest of the group, and level 3 is suspiciously easy. They just have to do facial recognition, which everyone does, but Courtney and Alex begin to suspect that something is wrong. Alex says he remembers the third level being different, and that he finds it strange that this level has changed so much.

Now they move on to the fourth level, where they are surprised to see Katie and Sadie in the stands. No one understands how they got there, to which Katie and Sadie simply say that once the interns realized they had been deceived, they brought them here as punishment.

Alex says that now they have to get through this level to reach Chris, where someone has to defeat an intern, and Bridgette volunteers. Out of nowhere, the hooded person Sierra saw appears, and everyone steps aside as Bridgette begins to fight that person.

It seemed like Bridgette had the upper hand, but suddenly... that person pulls out a crowbar and starts hitting Bridgette with it. Everyone feels bad for Bridgette, even Courtney thinks that even though she doesn't get along with Bridgette, she doesn't deserve to be beaten like that. 

Fortunately, in just 10 seconds, Izzy manages to defeat that person with ease, saving Bridgette. Geoff decides to carry her, but DJ says he is stronger, so he will take care of carrying her. Everyone finally moves on to the final part, but they see two crowbars. A computer says that the two crowbars will give them a surprise. 

Alex says they should choose the right one, but Trent doesn't trust it. Alex gives his reasoning, but that causes an argument among everyone about which lever to choose. Courtney is having an anxiety attack, having visions of what would happen, with terrible things in between. Courtney then has no choice and moves the left lever.

Everything goes dark, Gwen asks her what she did, and before Courtney can answer, slow applause is heard. Chris appears and tells them they passed the test, proving why they deserve to compete, and then everyone is shocked. All this time, they were in a simulation and didn't know it. 

Everyone looks at Alex, who doesn't understand what happened, saying that there was supposed to be something else, but Chris laughs at him, saying he's naive.

All this time, he was leading the contestants to something they would never find, and now they all feel deceived and manipulated. Alex gets so angry that he tries to hit Chris, but Chris dodges him and activates a trapdoor that opens, causing Alex to fall into the lava. Everyone watches in shock as the lava consumes Alex, who screams in pain.

Justin asks what would have happened if they had chosen the right crowbar, to which Chris responds that they would have met a fiery and painful end. Then the hooded person appears, who turns out to be Sierra's mother.

Everyone is surprised, and Sierra gets angry because her mother hurt Bridgette. Her mother laughs, saying that she only cares about Chris and that he is her only love. Everything is so confusing that Courtney slams her fist on the floor with all her might, angry at Chris because Courtney thought that lever would reveal something.

They came for Alejandro but found nothing, making the mission useless. Chris says it's fun to destroy people's hopes, and that he knew Alex would come, so that's why he did all this, to trick them and play a joke on them that would leave them paralyzed.

Then Chris leaves with a jetpack and Sierra's mother leaves with a flying hook. Everyone is paralyzed, not knowing what to say or think, their minds blank, as if it were all a simulation that, once completed, would erase their memories.

However, someone arrives and it turns out to be Chef, who comes to take them home. Chef tells them that he had nothing to do with what Chris planned; in fact, he was against it, but Chris didn't listen to him. Chef says that Alejandro is trapped inside the Drama Machine. Chris has him hidden in a kind of confinement that Chef doesn't know about, but Chef tells them that Alejandro is alive, just trapped.

Chef tells the contestants to come with him, and he will take them home. They all get on the plane that belonged to Alex, only now it is being flown by Chef. Despite the adversity and trauma they went through, the contestants hug each other. They all have their differences, but they share that unity against Chris.

They are all dropped off at home one by one, in a montage with relaxing music, and after that, Chef leaves. Sierra is sad because her mother will get away with it, to which Bridgette tells her, “Not for long.” 

Sierra's mother was calm at home until someone knocked on the door, and it turned out to be... the police. They arrest her for minors abuse, murder, kidnapping, attempted r word, SA, and attempted poisoning. Sierra's mother is arrested, and Sierra watches her, saying that karma brings a smile to her face.

Sierra's mother does not understand how the police discovered her, to which they respond that Bridgette's mother provided them with the address because Sierra told her where to find it, where they discovered numerous tapes documenting all of Sierra's mother's crimes.

She sees Chris and asks for his assistance, but Chris ignores her as he disappears into the shadows. The mother is taken to trial and eventually sentenced to prison. The other police officer tells Sierra that the Summers family (Bridgette's family, which is why Bridgette is called “Bridgette Summers”) will now have custody of Sierra, so officially, Sierra is part of Bridgette's family.

Bridgette and Sierra go to Bridgette's house to celebrate with her parents, and meanwhile, Tyler thinks about Alejandro and misses him. But the most interesting part is Heather's, as she finds a letter from Chris himself in her apartment and realizes something: Chris knows where they live.

In the end, Chris says it was fun to do that, and then tells Chef that he has already chosen the 13 campers who will participate in his new season, Total Drama: Revenge of the Island. A season where they will return to Wawanakwa Island, which will have changes that will make it dangerous, but fun.

This season will have a new cast, and to prove it, Chris shows the auditions of Anne Maria, B, Brick, Cameron, Dakota, Dawn, Jo, Lightning, Mike, Sam, Scott, Staci, and Zoey.

The post-credits scene is about the ROTI contestants receiving letters telling them that they have been accepted to compete.",5,1766954037.0,Totaldrama,9,0.86,False

I’ve been married for 26 years and had invested all of my time in my career and family. There was no time to have outside friends.

Now that everything is falling apart, I am stuck.

It’s only been 2 weeks since it started and I caught them almost immediately, but she said she won’t stop. Coincidentally, she asked for a divorce the day before I caught them.

We are cohabiting and have kids (12 and 17).

We will likely cohabitate for a while until we figure out a plan that works for all of us.

She is in full limerence, and is texting and talking to him multiple times a day. And every few days they meet in a nearby coffee shop parking lot.

I was a dcyf kid, so I have no family to lean on. And since it’s still a secret until we figure it out, I can’t lean on anyone on her family either.

She just keeps telling me how fine I’ll be, but I know it’s just to make herself feel better, to relieve her own guilt.

I mean I am an attractive and successful guy, but at 2.5 weeks into this, I don’t have the space to remember to eat, never mind date. Also I think it’s probably a bad idea to do while trying to sort through complex logistics around how to divorce and keep kids insulted.

I am one of those types of people that love deeply, and trust greatly, but only after I allow someone in, and there are not very many that I have let in.

I had a 20 year career in a high stress, high paying quant role in Boston for 20 years. And I know that put strain on the marriage, but I was not having fun at that job. I did it for the family. I transitioned onto a much lower stress and slightly lower paying, local job a few months ago, because the stress and time constraints were impacting our lives negatively, but clearly too late. The new job is still very good money ($185k) vs $204k - so I thought it would really help move us forward.

I’ve reached out to pretty much every old friend I have, but everyone is busy with their own lives and doesn’t really want to talk to be about my problems, which I understand.

How did anyone else in a similar situation build a new support network or find new friends?

I’m really struggling. I sit and ruminate because it’s impossible to ignore and I have no friends to help occupy my time and mind.

They found the couple just after dawn.

I heard about it from the radio first, the volume turned low like the announcer was afraid of waking something.

“Two bodies discovered early this morning near Hollow Road. Authorities report no signs of struggle. Cause of death pending.”

Pending meant never.

Evan was already waiting for me outside the hardware store when I arrived. He hadn’t opened yet. The lights were on inside, but he stood on the sidewalk with his arms crossed, watching Main Street like he expected it to blink.

“They’re dead,” he said.

“They drained?” I asked.

He nodded once. “Dry.”

We didn’t need to go see them. We already knew what we’d find: pale skin, sunken faces, mouths slightly open like they’d tried to breathe something that wasn’t there. No defensive wounds. No blood anywhere it should have been.

“They didn’t even run,” I said.

“They never do,” Evan replied. “Not once they’re chosen.”

That word sat wrong in my stomach.

We walked.

Not with purpose at first, just movement, like if we kept going we wouldn’t have to stop and think. Main Street was already awake. Cars idled at stop signs. The bakery was open. Mabel stood behind the counter, wiping the same spot on the register over and over.

Everything looked the same.

That was the problem.

A man crossed the street in front of us, stepping off the curb without looking. His movements were stiff, slightly delayed, like his body was waiting for instructions his brain hadn’t quite received yet. His skin had a grayish cast to it, and when he turned his head, his neck didn’t move smoothly; it jerked, then settled.

“You see it too, right?” I murmured.

Evan didn’t answer immediately.

Then: “Yeah.”

We passed Mrs. Hargreeve outside the post office. She smiled when she saw us. It was the same smile she’d always worn, but it lingered too long, stretched just a little too wide.

Her eyes didn’t blink.

“Morning, boys,” she said.

Her voice sounded hollow, like it was coming from a long way away.

“You okay?” Evan asked her.

“I’m fine,” she said automatically. “Always am.”

She turned and walked inside, steps perfectly even, hands folded at her waist.

“Did you notice her hands?” Evan whispered.

I nodded. “No tremor.”

We kept going.

At the diner, people ate without talking much. Forks rose and fell in uneven rhythms. Someone laughed half a second too late at a joke that hadn’t been funny. A man stared into his coffee like he was waiting for it to tell him what to do next.

They looked like themselves.

But sickly. Drained. Like copies printed from a fading original.

“They’re not feeding on each other,” I said slowly.

Evan stopped walking.

“They don’t need to,” he said.

The words hit me all at once.

“They’ve already fed,” I whispered. “Or they don’t need blood anymore.”

Evan’s face was pale. “Say it.”

I didn’t want to.

I said it anyway.

“They’re all vampires.”

The town kept moving.

A woman pushed a stroller with no child inside. A man swept the same patch of sidewalk again and again, never lifting the broom. A dog lay in the shade, ribs showing, eyes dull.

“Everyone except us,” Evan said.

“And Jason,” I added.

“And the couple,” Evan said. “And anyone else who didn’t… finish.”

Finish what? Turning.

My arm burned under the bandage.

“They didn’t bite me,” I said. “They could’ve.”

Evan nodded. “You weren’t food.”

“What was I?”

“Proof,” he said. “Or bait.”

We stood there while Briar Hollow went about the morning, the illusion holding just long enough to fool anyone passing through.

“How long?” I asked. “How long has it been like this?”

Evan looked toward Hollow Road, toward the Bellamy House hidden behind trees and rot.

“Longer than we think,” he said. “Maybe decades.”

“And no one noticed?”

“They did,” he said. “They just stopped asking questions.”

The realization settled in my chest, heavy and suffocating.

The town wasn’t hiding vampires.

The town was vampires.

And they were pretending, badly, to be human.

I thought of Jason. Of him coming back. Of him asking questions.

“He figured it out,” I said.

“And it killed him,” Evan replied.

A breeze moved through Main Street, carrying that same smell I’d noticed when I first came back; old wood, damp earth, rot.

Feeding ground.

The radio crackled again from inside the hardware store.

“Authorities assure residents there is no danger to the public.”

Evan laughed softly.

“There is,” he said. “Just not to them.”

I looked around at the faces, the movements, the careful mimicry of life.

“They know about us now,” I said.

Evan met my eyes.

“Yeah,” he said. “They always do.”

Somewhere, deep in the woods, something old was waking up for the night.

And this time, it wasn’t hunting strangers.

It was hunting us.

Chapter 6.

I started getting tired doing nothing.

That was the first sign.

I’d be sitting at the kitchen table, not moving, not thinking hard about anything, and my arms would feel heavy. My head would swim. Sometimes the room tilted just enough that I had to grip the edge of the chair to steady myself. Food tasted like ash. Coffee did nothing. Sleep came in shallow pieces and left me worse than before.

Evan noticed before I said anything.

“You’re pale,” he said one morning.

“I’ve always been pale.”

“Not like this.”

I caught my reflection in the window. My skin had taken on a grayish hue, faint but unmistakable. The shadows under my eyes looked bruised. When I pulled back the bandage on my arm, the cuts were still there, pink, angry, refusing to close.

“They’re not healing,” I said. Evan didn’t answer. The town noticed too.

People stared longer now. Heads turned when I passed. Conversations stopped mid-sentence and restarted too late. I felt eyes on my throat, my wrists, the places where blood moved close to the surface.

“They’re waiting,” Evan said that night. “You’re changing.”

“I’m not turning,” I said.

“No,” he agreed. “You’re starving.” They came after midnight. Not all at once, that would’ve been mercy.

It started with a sound, wood settling, maybe. A floorboard complaining under weight that didn’t belong there. Evan and I were both awake already, sitting in opposite rooms, pretending not to listen for it.

Then the knocking began. Not at the door. At the windows. Soft. Polite. Fingertips tapping glass like someone asking to be let in.

“Don’t answer,” Evan whispered. The tapping moved. Front of the house. Side. Back.

Surrounding us. The lights flickered. Then the glass shattered.

They didn’t rush. They never rushed. They stepped through broken windows and doors like guests arriving late to a party that had already started. Faces I recognized, neighbors, teachers, the woman from the post office. Their movements were stiff but purposeful now, hunger sharpening them.

One of them smiled at me.

“Caleb,” it said. My heart sank, stomach turning in a sick realization.

The voice sounded wrong coming from that mouth.

“Run,” Evan shouted.

They lunged.

I barely remember the next few seconds clearly, just impressions. Evan slamming into one of them, the sound of bones cracking. Hands grabbing at my jacket, my hair, my throat. Teeth snapping inches from my skin.

Something bit into my shoulder.

Not teeth.

Fingernails.

Pain exploded down my arm. I screamed and lashed out blindly, catching one of them across the face with a lamp. It shattered, sparks flying, and the thing reeled back hissing.

“They want you alive!” Evan yelled. “MOVE!”

We ran through the back of the house as something crashed through the hallway wall behind us. I stumbled on the porch steps, went down hard, and felt hands wrap around my ankle.

I kicked. Missed. Kicked again. The grip tightened. My vision tunneled. I could feel my heartbeat slowing, like it was deciding whether to keep going. My vision tunneled, body becoming less willing to fight, like the hand was taking my energy, my life.

Evan grabbed me under the arms and hauled me free. We didn’t stop running until the church came into view.

The church doors were locked. Of course they were.

Evan slammed into them anyway, shoulder-first, again and again. My legs buckled beneath me. I slid down the steps, breath coming in ragged gasps.

“They’re close,” I croaked.

Evan fumbled with his keys, hands shaking. “Come on, come on,”

The doors burst open. We fell inside and slammed them shut behind us. The noise outside stopped instantly.

Silence.

Heavy. Pressing.

I lay on the cold stone floor, chest burning, every nerve screaming. Evan dragged me farther in, toward the altar, until my back hit the base of the pulpit. I looked out as I heaved. The pews sat like gravestones, silent, forgotten. They lay gracefully in perfect rows, the only perfection seen in the town since I had arrived.

“They won’t cross the threshold,” he said, breathless. “They never have.”

As if to prove him right, shadows gathered outside the stained-glass windows. Shapes moved. Faces pressed close, but none of them entered.

“They’re waiting,” I whispered.

“Yeah,” Evan said. “But so are we.”

Morning light filtered in pale and thin. I felt worse.

My skin burned where the sunlight touched it, not painfully, just wrong. Like it didn’t belong to me anymore. Evan tore a strip from his shirt and wrapped my shoulder, jaw tight.

“They almost killed you,” he said.

“They didn’t,” I replied. “They almost finished something.”

We sat in the pews and took stock.

Holy water sat in a chipped basin by the door. Candles lined the altar. Wooden crosses hung everywhere, old, worn smooth by hands that had believed hard enough to keep going.

“You think this stuff actually works?” I asked.

Evan picked up a cross, weighing it in his hand. “I think belief matters.”

“Mine’s running low.”

“Then borrow mine,” he said.

I laughed weakly, then stopped when it hurt.

“They can’t come in,” I said slowly. “So there has to be something about the place itself, ground, symbols, boundaries.”

Evan nodded. “Rules.”

“Everything has rules.”

Outside, something screamed.

Not angry. Frustrated.

I leaned my head back against the pew and closed my eyes.

We weren’t safe.

But we weren’t dead.

Yet.

And for the first time since I came back to Briar Hollow, I felt something other than fear claw its way up through the exhaustion.

Resolve.

If they had rules, we could break them.

Chapter 7.

The church kept us alive, but it didn’t give us answers.

By the second night, I could barely stand for more than a few minutes at a time. My hands shook constantly now. My heartbeat felt uneven, like it was skipping steps. Evan watched me with the same look people wear at hospital beds, measuring, counting, preparing.

“We can’t wait this out,” he said.

“I know.”

The vampires didn’t leave. They gathered outside at dusk and stayed until morning, silhouettes pressed against stained glass, listening. Sometimes they spoke, quietly, respectfully, like neighbors asking a favor.

They never said Evan’s name.

They said mine.

The church had a small office in back, lined with old books no one had touched in years. Sermons, journals, town records donated by families who wanted their pasts preserved but not remembered. Evan pulled volume after volume down while I sat on the floor and tried not to pass out.

“You remember old Father Mallory?” Evan asked.

“The one who left town?”

“The one who vanished,” Evan said. “No forwarding address. No obituary.”

He handed me a thin, leather-bound book.

Inside were notes. Not sermons, warnings.

The first feeds to create many.

The many feed to protect the first.

Kill the root and the rot dies with it.

I swallowed. “You’re saying there’s an original.”

“The strongest,” Evan said. “The one that started it here.”

“And if it dies?”

“The rest fall,” he said. “Or turn back, or burn. Depends on how long they’ve been gone.”

My vision blurred. “And the bite?”

Evan hesitated.

“Say it.”

“The mark fades,” he said. “If the original dies.”

Hope flared, sharp, dangerous.

“How do we kill it?”

Evan’s voice was quiet. “Only someone already marked can.”

I laughed weakly. “Of course.”

The plan came together the way bad ideas always do, fast, desperate, and inevitable.

“They won’t kill you,” Evan said. “Not right away. You’re valuable.”

“I’m bait.”

“You’re leverage.”

“Same thing.”

We needed to draw the original out, away from the town, away from the others. The Bellamy House was the obvious choice, but Evan shook his head.

“That’s a nest,” he said. “Not a throne.”

“So where?”

Evan looked at me.

“The quarry.”

My stomach dropped.

The place we swore we’d never go again.

Night came heavy and thick.

I left the church alone, walking instead of driving, every step an effort. The town watched me go. Porch lights flicked on in sequence. Curtains shifted. Shapes followed at a distance, never close enough to touch.

The quarry yawned open ahead, black and deep.

I didn’t make it halfway down the path before the pain hit.

Something slammed into my back and sent me sprawling. Hands pinned me to the ground. My leg twisted the wrong way. I screamed.

“Easy,” a voice said. I froze.

I knew that voice.

“No,” I whispered. The figure stepped into the moonlight.

Jason looked the same.

That was the worst part.

Same crooked smile. Same eyes. Same scar on his chin from when we were twelve and he fell off Evan’s bike. He looked healthier than he had at the funeral, fuller somehow, glowing faintly like he’d swallowed light.

“You came back,” he said. “I hoped you would.”

My chest burned. “You died.”

Jason crouched in front of me. “I changed.”

The others stayed back, heads bowed. Followers.

“Oh God,” I whispered. “You’re the first.”

Jason smiled sadly. “In Briar Hollow? Yeah.”

He touched my shoulder.

Pain exploded through me. I screamed as something tore open, skin, muscle, certainty. He didn’t bite. He fed through the wound, like pulling warmth straight out of me.

“I didn’t want it to be you,” he said. “But you were always stronger.”

My vision went dark at the edges.

Evan burst from the trees, swinging a length of iron pipe. It connected with Jason’s head and sent him reeling, but he didn’t fall.

Jason stood slowly.

“Still trying to save everyone,” he said. “Some things never change.”

“You murdered them,” Evan shouted. “The town.”

Jason’s expression hardened. “I gave them peace. No fear. No endings.”

“And Jason?” I gasped. “What did you give yourself?”

He looked at me then, really looked.

“I gave myself forever,” he said. “And you’re the only one who can stop it.”

The realization hit me harder than the pain. He’d known.

From the beginning.

He stepped back, spreading his arms. “Do it.”

My hands closed around the knife Evan had pressed into my palm earlier, wooden handle, iron blade, etched with symbols from the church.

“You marked me on purpose,” I said.

Jason nodded. “Because it had to be you.”

The quarry wind howled.

The others watched. Waiting.

I stood on shaking legs and faced my best friend.

“I’m sorry,” I said.

Jason smiled. “I know.”

And I raised the blade.

Chapter 8.

The quarry wind cut like knives, stinging every exposed inch of my skin. My muscles screamed before I even moved. Every step toward Jason felt heavier than the last. I gripped the iron-bladed knife so tightly my fingers ached, knuckles white.

Around us, shadows moved. The followers stirred; silent, swift, and countless. They didn’t rush at me yet. They circled. Watching. Waiting. Like predators who know the prey is wounded.

Jason stood at the edge of the cliff, arms spread, smiling faintly, as if he had all the time in the world.

“You came,” he said. His voice carried over the wind, calm, patient, terrifying. “I hoped you would.”

I didn’t answer. My breathing was ragged. I raised the blade. The iron caught the moonlight.

Then they attacked.

They didn’t run. They didn’t hesitate. The followers lunged from the shadows like a tide of black and gray. Hands grabbed at my arms, shoulders, legs. Teeth snapped near my neck. I kicked, swung, cursed, I couldn’t fight them all. One sank its teeth into my forearm, but Evan had told me the church mark protected me from the full bite. The pain burned, but I stayed conscious.

Jason stepped back, letting them keep me occupied, untouched. “You’ll need to fight harder,” he said.

I did. I slammed into one, broke free of another, ducked under a snapping jaw. My arm was bleeding, my chest heaving. The knife felt impossibly light in my hand, and impossibly heavy with everything it had to do.

Finally, after what felt like hours, I saw an opening. Jason had misstepped, balancing too close to the quarry edge. One clean swing of the knife could end this. But I couldn’t get close enough; the followers wouldn’t let me.

I screamed, charging. Two of them grabbed me, pinning my arms, twisting me down. A third bit my shoulder. Pain lanced through me. I cried out, striking at them with fists and legs, ignoring the blood that ran down my sleeve.

Somehow, I did. Somehow, I wrenched myself free, grabbed the knife with both hands, and tackled Jason to the ground. We crashed against the gravel. His eyes were calm now. Almost… sad.

“You could’ve been everything to me,” I gasped between heavy breaths. “Why? Why did you do this?”

Jason’s smile was faint, almost human. “I gave them peace… I gave myself a chance at forever. I didn’t choose you to suffer. I chose you because you could end it.”

I couldn’t answer. My muscles burned. Every movement felt like lifting a mountain. The knife hovered above his chest. I shook. I wanted to scream.

The followers pounced again, pinning me from the sides, pulling at my legs. Their teeth glinted in the moonlight. One of them sank into my calf. I felt myself slipping, my grip weakening.

Jason laughed softly, almost gently. “You’re stronger than them. Stronger than me.”

I roared, summoning every ounce of remaining strength. I held him down. Face to face. Eyes wide. “Why, Jason? Why betray me? Why all of them?”

His expression softened, almost tender. “I loved you. I still do. I had to be this way… to keep Briar Hollow alive. And you… you have to finish it. You’re the only one who can.

I swallowed bile. My grip on the knife tightened.

And then, finally, I drove it into his chest.

He gasped, a sound like wind through broken trees. His hand reached up, touching my arm. “Thank… you…”

His body went slack. His eyes rolled back. Light left him, leaving only the stillness of death behind.

The followers froze. A ripple ran through them. Their faces went blank. For the first time, they hesitated.

And then, with a sound like wind tearing through iron, they fled. Not all at once, but each one dissolved into the shadows, leaving only silence behind.

I collapsed, knife falling from my hands. My body ached, blood soaked my clothes, but the worst, the unbearable weight; was gone.

Evan knelt beside me, trembling. “It’s… over?”

I nodded weakly, too exhausted to speak. My chest burned. My vision swam. The wind carried nothing now but the faint scent of the quarry and something cleaner, like hope.

Jason, the friend I loved, the monster who had betrayed me, was gone.

And for the first time in weeks, I could breathe without feeling the hunger, the pull, the suffocating shadow of Briar Hollow.

But I knew, deep down, the mark still pulsed faintly beneath my skin.

I had survived. I had killed the original.

And in this town of whispers and shadows, that meant something.

Something terrifying.

Because now… I was the only one left marked.

Chapter 9.

Weeks passed. The nights were quieter now, the shadows thinner, though the memory of Briar Hollow’s hunger never fully left me. I hadn’t gone back to the town until that day—until I felt like I needed to see him one last time. Not for forgiveness, not for closure, just to say goodbye.d

I drove slowly down Hollow Road. Gravel crunched under the tires. The Bellamy House stood empty, still and lifeless, like it had forgotten how to breathe. The upstairs window was dark. No light. No waiting. Just emptiness.

I stepped out of the car and walked to the edge of the clearing, the same cliff where it had all ended. My hands shook, the wind tugging at my sleeves. I stared down at the spot where Jason had fallen, where the followers had dissolved, where everything had ended and begun all at once.

I couldn’t speak at first. I couldn’t even think. My chest felt hollow, my stomach tight with memories I didn’t want to remember but couldn’t escape. And then the words came, trembling, broken:

“Goodbye, Jason.”

I sank to my knees. The wind whipped around me, carrying whispers I couldn’t name. Tears ran freely, unashamed, for all the anger, all the betrayal, all the love I’d never let myself admit. I didn’t scream. I didn’t shout. I just cried, the sound swallowed by the empty quarry, the world holding its breath with me.

When I finally stood, my legs weak and shaking, Evan was there. He didn’t say anything. He didn’t have to. He had stayed in the car until he knew I was ready. We looked at each other, and in that silence, everything was said.

“Ready?” he asked softly.

I nodded, gripping his hand for a moment longer than I needed to. “Yeah.”

We walked back to the car together, the road ahead uncertain but lighter than the one behind us. Briar Hollow receded in the rearview mirror, shadows stretching and fading, as if the town itself was finally letting us go.

No apologies. No promises. Just a final goodbye…to Jason, to the town, to the weight we had carried for so long.

And then we left.

What I hate the most tho is when people criticize it. Like trust me I’m aware!!! You pointing it out isnt helping!!! I dont need a lecture about how my tastebuds will “mature” or how I’ll “grow out of it”. I already push myself more than ppl think but I genuinely cant see myself ever reaching a point where I’d be considered a normal eater.

yellow = depends on mood / prep / vibes

green = foods I actually like

I’ll be traveling solo, and I’m really hoping to experience a mix of relaxation and adventure. I’m a huge beach lover (I plan on spending a LOT of time by the water), I love animals, I enjoy thrill-type activities, and I consider myself a total foodie — so I’d love to hear about anything from must-try restaurants and local snacks to fun excursions and hidden gems.
If there are any Carnaval-related events, parades, or parties that are especially worth checking out, please let me know! I’d also love advice on safety for solo travelers, best ways to get around, and anything people usually wish they knew before coming.
So far, I’ve been looking into a few things that caught my eye:
De Palm Tours / Renaissance Island tour
Beach horseback riding
National park ride (I saw one that mentions a natural pool)
Renaissance spa + Flamingo Beach
If you’ve done any of these — were they worth it? Anything overrated I should skip?
Open to literally any recommendations: beaches, day trips, local experiences, bars, places to watch the sunset, affordable food spots, or even simple things like where to grab great coffee in the morning.

They found the couple just after dawn.

I heard about it from the radio first, the volume turned low like the announcer was afraid of waking something.

“Two bodies discovered early this morning near Hollow Road. Authorities report no signs of struggle. Cause of death pending.”

Pending meant never.

Evan was already waiting for me outside the hardware store when I arrived. He hadn’t opened yet. The lights were on inside, but he stood on the sidewalk with his arms crossed, watching Main Street like he expected it to blink.

“They’re dead,” he said.

“They drained?” I asked.

He nodded once. “Dry.”

We didn’t need to go see them. We already knew what we’d find: pale skin, sunken faces, mouths slightly open like they’d tried to breathe something that wasn’t there. No defensive wounds. No blood anywhere it should have been.

“They didn’t even run,” I said.

“They never do,” Evan replied. “Not once they’re chosen.”

That word sat wrong in my stomach.

We walked.

Not with purpose at first, just movement, like if we kept going we wouldn’t have to stop and think. Main Street was already awake. Cars idled at stop signs. The bakery was open. Mabel stood behind the counter, wiping the same spot on the register over and over.

Everything looked the same.

That was the problem.

A man crossed the street in front of us, stepping off the curb without looking. His movements were stiff, slightly delayed, like his body was waiting for instructions his brain hadn’t quite received yet. His skin had a grayish cast to it, and when he turned his head, his neck didn’t move smoothly; it jerked, then settled.

“You see it too, right?” I murmured.

Evan didn’t answer immediately.

Then: “Yeah.”

We passed Mrs. Hargreeve outside the post office. She smiled when she saw us. It was the same smile she’d always worn, but it lingered too long, stretched just a little too wide.

Her eyes didn’t blink.

“Morning, boys,” she said.

Her voice sounded hollow, like it was coming from a long way away.

“You okay?” Evan asked her.

“I’m fine,” she said automatically. “Always am.”

She turned and walked inside, steps perfectly even, hands folded at her waist.

“Did you notice her hands?” Evan whispered.

I nodded. “No tremor.”

We kept going.

At the diner, people ate without talking much. Forks rose and fell in uneven rhythms. Someone laughed half a second too late at a joke that hadn’t been funny. A man stared into his coffee like he was waiting for it to tell him what to do next.

They looked like themselves.

But sickly. Drained. Like copies printed from a fading original.

“They’re not feeding on each other,” I said slowly.

Evan stopped walking.

“They don’t need to,” he said.

The words hit me all at once.

“They’ve already fed,” I whispered. “Or they don’t need blood anymore.”

Evan’s face was pale. “Say it.”

I didn’t want to.

I said it anyway.

“They’re all vampires.”

The town kept moving.

A woman pushed a stroller with no child inside. A man swept the same patch of sidewalk again and again, never lifting the broom. A dog lay in the shade, ribs showing, eyes dull.

“Everyone except us,” Evan said.

“And Jason,” I added.

“And the couple,” Evan said. “And anyone else who didn’t… finish.”

Finish what? Turning.

My arm burned under the bandage.

“They didn’t bite me,” I said. “They could’ve.”

Evan nodded. “You weren’t food.”

“What was I?”

“Proof,” he said. “Or bait.”

We stood there while Briar Hollow went about the morning, the illusion holding just long enough to fool anyone passing through.

“How long?” I asked. “How long has it been like this?”

Evan looked toward Hollow Road, toward the Bellamy House hidden behind trees and rot.

“Longer than we think,” he said. “Maybe decades.”

“And no one noticed?”

“They did,” he said. “They just stopped asking questions.”

The realization settled in my chest, heavy and suffocating.

The town wasn’t hiding vampires.

The town was vampires.

And they were pretending, badly, to be human.

I thought of Jason. Of him coming back. Of him asking questions.

“He figured it out,” I said.

“And it killed him,” Evan replied.

A breeze moved through Main Street, carrying that same smell I’d noticed when I first came back; old wood, damp earth, rot.

Feeding ground.

The radio crackled again from inside the hardware store.

“Authorities assure residents there is no danger to the public.”

Evan laughed softly.

“There is,” he said. “Just not to them.”

I looked around at the faces, the movements, the careful mimicry of life.

“They know about us now,” I said.

Evan met my eyes.

“Yeah,” he said. “They always do.”

Somewhere, deep in the woods, something old was waking up for the night.

And this time, it wasn’t hunting strangers.

It was hunting us.

Chapter 6.

I started getting tired doing nothing.

That was the first sign.

I’d be sitting at the kitchen table, not moving, not thinking hard about anything, and my arms would feel heavy. My head would swim. Sometimes the room tilted just enough that I had to grip the edge of the chair to steady myself. Food tasted like ash. Coffee did nothing. Sleep came in shallow pieces and left me worse than before.

Evan noticed before I said anything.

“You’re pale,” he said one morning.

“I’ve always been pale.”

“Not like this.”

I caught my reflection in the window. My skin had taken on a grayish hue, faint but unmistakable. The shadows under my eyes looked bruised. When I pulled back the bandage on my arm, the cuts were still there, pink, angry, refusing to close.

“They’re not healing,” I said. Evan didn’t answer. The town noticed too.

People stared longer now. Heads turned when I passed. Conversations stopped mid-sentence and restarted too late. I felt eyes on my throat, my wrists, the places where blood moved close to the surface.

“They’re waiting,” Evan said that night. “You’re changing.”

“I’m not turning,” I said.

“No,” he agreed. “You’re starving.” They came after midnight. Not all at once, that would’ve been mercy.

It started with a sound, wood settling, maybe. A floorboard complaining under weight that didn’t belong there. Evan and I were both awake already, sitting in opposite rooms, pretending not to listen for it.

Then the knocking began. Not at the door. At the windows. Soft. Polite. Fingertips tapping glass like someone asking to be let in.

“Don’t answer,” Evan whispered. The tapping moved. Front of the house. Side. Back.

Surrounding us. The lights flickered. Then the glass shattered.

They didn’t rush. They never rushed. They stepped through broken windows and doors like guests arriving late to a party that had already started. Faces I recognized, neighbors, teachers, the woman from the post office. Their movements were stiff but purposeful now, hunger sharpening them.

One of them smiled at me.

“Caleb,” it said. My heart sank, stomach turning in a sick realization.

The voice sounded wrong coming from that mouth.

“Run,” Evan shouted.

They lunged.

I barely remember the next few seconds clearly, just impressions. Evan slamming into one of them, the sound of bones cracking. Hands grabbing at my jacket, my hair, my throat. Teeth snapping inches from my skin.

Something bit into my shoulder.

Not teeth.

Fingernails.

Pain exploded down my arm. I screamed and lashed out blindly, catching one of them across the face with a lamp. It shattered, sparks flying, and the thing reeled back hissing.

“They want you alive!” Evan yelled. “MOVE!”

We ran through the back of the house as something crashed through the hallway wall behind us. I stumbled on the porch steps, went down hard, and felt hands wrap around my ankle.

I kicked. Missed. Kicked again. The grip tightened. My vision tunneled. I could feel my heartbeat slowing, like it was deciding whether to keep going. My vision tunneled, body becoming less willing to fight, like the hand was taking my energy, my life.

Evan grabbed me under the arms and hauled me free. We didn’t stop running until the church came into view.

The church doors were locked. Of course they were.

Evan slammed into them anyway, shoulder-first, again and again. My legs buckled beneath me. I slid down the steps, breath coming in ragged gasps.

“They’re close,” I croaked.

Evan fumbled with his keys, hands shaking. “Come on, come on,”

The doors burst open. We fell inside and slammed them shut behind us. The noise outside stopped instantly.

Silence.

Heavy. Pressing.

I lay on the cold stone floor, chest burning, every nerve screaming. Evan dragged me farther in, toward the altar, until my back hit the base of the pulpit. I looked out as I heaved. The pews sat like gravestones, silent, forgotten. They lay gracefully in perfect rows, the only perfection seen in the town since I had arrived.

“They won’t cross the threshold,” he said, breathless. “They never have.”

As if to prove him right, shadows gathered outside the stained-glass windows. Shapes moved. Faces pressed close, but none of them entered.

“They’re waiting,” I whispered.

“Yeah,” Evan said. “But so are we.”

Morning light filtered in pale and thin. I felt worse.

My skin burned where the sunlight touched it, not painfully, just wrong. Like it didn’t belong to me anymore. Evan tore a strip from his shirt and wrapped my shoulder, jaw tight.

“They almost killed you,” he said.

“They didn’t,” I replied. “They almost finished something.”

We sat in the pews and took stock.

Holy water sat in a chipped basin by the door. Candles lined the altar. Wooden crosses hung everywhere, old, worn smooth by hands that had believed hard enough to keep going.

“You think this stuff actually works?” I asked.

Evan picked up a cross, weighing it in his hand. “I think belief matters.”

“Mine’s running low.”

“Then borrow mine,” he said.

I laughed weakly, then stopped when it hurt.

“They can’t come in,” I said slowly. “So there has to be something about the place itself, ground, symbols, boundaries.”

Evan nodded. “Rules.”

“Everything has rules.”

Outside, something screamed.

Not angry. Frustrated.

I leaned my head back against the pew and closed my eyes.

We weren’t safe.

But we weren’t dead.

Yet.

And for the first time since I came back to Briar Hollow, I felt something other than fear claw its way up through the exhaustion.

Resolve.

If they had rules, we could break them.

Chapter 7.

The church kept us alive, but it didn’t give us answers.

By the second night, I could barely stand for more than a few minutes at a time. My hands shook constantly now. My heartbeat felt uneven, like it was skipping steps. Evan watched me with the same look people wear at hospital beds, measuring, counting, preparing.

“We can’t wait this out,” he said.

“I know.”

The vampires didn’t leave. They gathered outside at dusk and stayed until morning, silhouettes pressed against stained glass, listening. Sometimes they spoke, quietly, respectfully, like neighbors asking a favor.

They never said Evan’s name.

They said mine.

The church had a small office in back, lined with old books no one had touched in years. Sermons, journals, town records donated by families who wanted their pasts preserved but not remembered. Evan pulled volume after volume down while I sat on the floor and tried not to pass out.

“You remember old Father Mallory?” Evan asked.

“The one who left town?”

“The one who vanished,” Evan said. “No forwarding address. No obituary.”

He handed me a thin, leather-bound book.

Inside were notes. Not sermons, warnings.

The first feeds to create many.

The many feed to protect the first.

Kill the root and the rot dies with it.

I swallowed. “You’re saying there’s an original.”

“The strongest,” Evan said. “The one that started it here.”

“And if it dies?”

“The rest fall,” he said. “Or turn back, or burn. Depends on how long they’ve been gone.”

My vision blurred. “And the bite?”

Evan hesitated.

“Say it.”

“The mark fades,” he said. “If the original dies.”

Hope flared, sharp, dangerous.

“How do we kill it?”

Evan’s voice was quiet. “Only someone already marked can.”

I laughed weakly. “Of course.”

The plan came together the way bad ideas always do, fast, desperate, and inevitable.

“They won’t kill you,” Evan said. “Not right away. You’re valuable.”

“I’m bait.”

“You’re leverage.”

“Same thing.”

We needed to draw the original out, away from the town, away from the others. The Bellamy House was the obvious choice, but Evan shook his head.

“That’s a nest,” he said. “Not a throne.”

“So where?”

Evan looked at me.

“The quarry.”

My stomach dropped.

The place we swore we’d never go again.

Night came heavy and thick.

I left the church alone, walking instead of driving, every step an effort. The town watched me go. Porch lights flicked on in sequence. Curtains shifted. Shapes followed at a distance, never close enough to touch.

The quarry yawned open ahead, black and deep.

I didn’t make it halfway down the path before the pain hit.

Something slammed into my back and sent me sprawling. Hands pinned me to the ground. My leg twisted the wrong way. I screamed.

“Easy,” a voice said. I froze.

I knew that voice.

“No,” I whispered. The figure stepped into the moonlight.

Jason looked the same.

That was the worst part.

Same crooked smile. Same eyes. Same scar on his chin from when we were twelve and he fell off Evan’s bike. He looked healthier than he had at the funeral, fuller somehow, glowing faintly like he’d swallowed light.

“You came back,” he said. “I hoped you would.”

My chest burned. “You died.”

Jason crouched in front of me. “I changed.”

The others stayed back, heads bowed. Followers.

“Oh God,” I whispered. “You’re the first.”

Jason smiled sadly. “In Briar Hollow? Yeah.”

He touched my shoulder.

Pain exploded through me. I screamed as something tore open, skin, muscle, certainty. He didn’t bite. He fed through the wound, like pulling warmth straight out of me.

“I didn’t want it to be you,” he said. “But you were always stronger.”

My vision went dark at the edges.

Evan burst from the trees, swinging a length of iron pipe. It connected with Jason’s head and sent him reeling, but he didn’t fall.

Jason stood slowly.

“Still trying to save everyone,” he said. “Some things never change.”

“You murdered them,” Evan shouted. “The town.”

Jason’s expression hardened. “I gave them peace. No fear. No endings.”

“And Jason?” I gasped. “What did you give yourself?”

He looked at me then, really looked.

“I gave myself forever,” he said. “And you’re the only one who can stop it.”

The realization hit me harder than the pain. He’d known.

From the beginning.

He stepped back, spreading his arms. “Do it.”

My hands closed around the knife Evan had pressed into my palm earlier, wooden handle, iron blade, etched with symbols from the church.

“You marked me on purpose,” I said.

Jason nodded. “Because it had to be you.”

The quarry wind howled.

The others watched. Waiting.

I stood on shaking legs and faced my best friend.

“I’m sorry,” I said.

Jason smiled. “I know.”

And I raised the blade.

Chapter 8.

The quarry wind cut like knives, stinging every exposed inch of my skin. My muscles screamed before I even moved. Every step toward Jason felt heavier than the last. I gripped the iron-bladed knife so tightly my fingers ached, knuckles white.

Around us, shadows moved. The followers stirred; silent, swift, and countless. They didn’t rush at me yet. They circled. Watching. Waiting. Like predators who know the prey is wounded.

Jason stood at the edge of the cliff, arms spread, smiling faintly, as if he had all the time in the world.

“You came,” he said. His voice carried over the wind, calm, patient, terrifying. “I hoped you would.”

I didn’t answer. My breathing was ragged. I raised the blade. The iron caught the moonlight.

Then they attacked.

They didn’t run. They didn’t hesitate. The followers lunged from the shadows like a tide of black and gray. Hands grabbed at my arms, shoulders, legs. Teeth snapped near my neck. I kicked, swung, cursed, I couldn’t fight them all. One sank its teeth into my forearm, but Evan had told me the church mark protected me from the full bite. The pain burned, but I stayed conscious.

Jason stepped back, letting them keep me occupied, untouched. “You’ll need to fight harder,” he said.

I did. I slammed into one, broke free of another, ducked under a snapping jaw. My arm was bleeding, my chest heaving. The knife felt impossibly light in my hand, and impossibly heavy with everything it had to do.

Finally, after what felt like hours, I saw an opening. Jason had misstepped, balancing too close to the quarry edge. One clean swing of the knife could end this. But I couldn’t get close enough; the followers wouldn’t let me.

I screamed, charging. Two of them grabbed me, pinning my arms, twisting me down. A third bit my shoulder. Pain lanced through me. I cried out, striking at them with fists and legs, ignoring the blood that ran down my sleeve.

Somehow, I did. Somehow, I wrenched myself free, grabbed the knife with both hands, and tackled Jason to the ground. We crashed against the gravel. His eyes were calm now. Almost… sad.

“You could’ve been everything to me,” I gasped between heavy breaths. “Why? Why did you do this?”

Jason’s smile was faint, almost human. “I gave them peace… I gave myself a chance at forever. I didn’t choose you to suffer. I chose you because you could end it.”

I couldn’t answer. My muscles burned. Every movement felt like lifting a mountain. The knife hovered above his chest. I shook. I wanted to scream.

The followers pounced again, pinning me from the sides, pulling at my legs. Their teeth glinted in the moonlight. One of them sank into my calf. I felt myself slipping, my grip weakening.

Jason laughed softly, almost gently. “You’re stronger than them. Stronger than me.”

I roared, summoning every ounce of remaining strength. I held him down. Face to face. Eyes wide. “Why, Jason? Why betray me? Why all of them?”

His expression softened, almost tender. “I loved you. I still do. I had to be this way… to keep Briar Hollow alive. And you… you have to finish it. You’re the only one who can.

I swallowed bile. My grip on the knife tightened.

And then, finally, I drove it into his chest.

He gasped, a sound like wind through broken trees. His hand reached up, touching my arm. “Thank… you…”

His body went slack. His eyes rolled back. Light left him, leaving only the stillness of death behind.

The followers froze. A ripple ran through them. Their faces went blank. For the first time, they hesitated.

And then, with a sound like wind tearing through iron, they fled. Not all at once, but each one dissolved into the shadows, leaving only silence behind.

I collapsed, knife falling from my hands. My body ached, blood soaked my clothes, but the worst, the unbearable weight; was gone.

Evan knelt beside me, trembling. “It’s… over?”

I nodded weakly, too exhausted to speak. My chest burned. My vision swam. The wind carried nothing now but the faint scent of the quarry and something cleaner, like hope.

Jason, the friend I loved, the monster who had betrayed me, was gone.

And for the first time in weeks, I could breathe without feeling the hunger, the pull, the suffocating shadow of Briar Hollow.

But I knew, deep down, the mark still pulsed faintly beneath my skin.

I had survived. I had killed the original.

And in this town of whispers and shadows, that meant something.

Something terrifying.

Because now… I was the only one left marked.

Chapter 9.

Weeks passed. The nights were quieter now, the shadows thinner, though the memory of Briar Hollow’s hunger never fully left me. I hadn’t gone back to the town until that day—until I felt like I needed to see him one last time. Not for forgiveness, not for closure, just to say goodbye.d

I drove slowly down Hollow Road. Gravel crunched under the tires. The Bellamy House stood empty, still and lifeless, like it had forgotten how to breathe. The upstairs window was dark. No light. No waiting. Just emptiness.

I stepped out of the car and walked to the edge of the clearing, the same cliff where it had all ended. My hands shook, the wind tugging at my sleeves. I stared down at the spot where Jason had fallen, where the followers had dissolved, where everything had ended and begun all at once.

I couldn’t speak at first. I couldn’t even think. My chest felt hollow, my stomach tight with memories I didn’t want to remember but couldn’t escape. And then the words came, trembling, broken:

“Goodbye, Jason.”

I sank to my knees. The wind whipped around me, carrying whispers I couldn’t name. Tears ran freely, unashamed, for all the anger, all the betrayal, all the love I’d never let myself admit. I didn’t scream. I didn’t shout. I just cried, the sound swallowed by the empty quarry, the world holding its breath with me.

When I finally stood, my legs weak and shaking, Evan was there. He didn’t say anything. He didn’t have to. He had stayed in the car until he knew I was ready. We looked at each other, and in that silence, everything was said.

“Ready?” he asked softly.

I nodded, gripping his hand for a moment longer than I needed to. “Yeah.”

We walked back to the car together, the road ahead uncertain but lighter than the one behind us. Briar Hollow receded in the rearview mirror, shadows stretching and fading, as if the town itself was finally letting us go.

No apologies. No promises. Just a final goodbye…to Jason, to the town, to the weight we had carried for so long.

And then we left.

I’ve been married for 26 years and had invested all of my time in my career and family. There was no time to have outside friends.

Now that everything is falling apart, I am stuck.

It’s only been 2 weeks since it started and I caught them almost immediately, but she said she won’t stop. Coincidentally, she asked for a divorce the day before I caught them.

We are cohabiting and have kids (12 and 17).

We will likely cohabitate for a while until we figure out a plan that works for all of us.

She is in full limerence, and is texting and talking to him multiple times a day. And every few days they meet in a nearby coffee shop parking lot.

I was a dcyf kid, so I have no family to lean on. And since it’s still a secret until we figure it out, I can’t lean on anyone on her family either.

She just keeps telling me how fine I’ll be, but I know it’s just to make herself feel better, to relieve her own guilt.

I mean I am an attractive and successful guy, but at 2.5 weeks into this, I don’t have the space to remember to eat, never mind date. Also I think it’s probably a bad idea to do while trying to sort through complex logistics around how to divorce and keep kids insulted.

I am one of those types of people that love deeply, and trust greatly, but only after I allow someone in, and there are not very many that I have let in.

I had a 20 year career in a high stress, high paying quant role in Boston for 20 years. And I know that put strain on the marriage, but I was not having fun at that job. I did it for the family. I transitioned onto a much lower stress and slightly lower paying, local job a few months ago, because the stress and time constraints were impacting our lives negatively, but clearly too late. The new job is still very good money ($185k) vs $204k - so I thought it would really help move us forward.

I’ve reached out to pretty much every old friend I have, but everyone is busy with their own lives and doesn’t really want to talk to be about my problems, which I understand.

How did anyone else in a similar situation build a new support network or find new friends?

I’m really struggling. I sit and ruminate because it’s impossible to ignore and I have no friends to help occupy my time and mind.

However yesterday, I was like at a bar like eatery when suddenly about 3 workers ""popped out of no where"". They did not come from the restroom and just seemed to appeared around the corner with no doors.

It went from having just 4 servers to nearly doubling to 8 servers in that few seconds. They did not walk in from the door or was in the restroom. I instantly turned around and asked this one other customer who seemed to showcased heavy awareness.

He agreed with me right away, saying just a few seconds ago more workers popped out of no where, but they seemed to literally popped out of no where (as he was sitting by the restroom) We were facing different directions, I was facing the kitchen and cashier. He was by the restroom and was facing the exit. And he also highlight that he did not see them come in or went out from the restroom, but just popped in. There was another worker there that seemed like she had a lot of knowledge and wisdom and awarenesss but I did not get a chance to ask her if she noticed it also.

This synchronizes with certain skyrim mods where you download a specific character inside the game, and then you disabled it and they dissapear. You enable it and they reappear. Except this time, they could also somehow do it, like a spiritual ""block list"" where you can not see them. Now, if such is the case, this would change the game. Even if this was done on purpose to gaslight, using sleight of body (basically hiding them somewhere under the table at corners where they knew I would not look. Or ducking for 15 minutes just to gas light me behind the front desk) Again, if all these were prepared to look that way, it for sure a lot of people would know what is going on.

\*One time I held a bbq/beer at my spot on a random day not close to summer time or any holiday. That day, we all met up to drink a bit of coffee before heading to the bbq. This guy literally walks up to us wearing a shirt of bbq and beer. Everyone in my circle noticed the synchronicity because no one ever approaches us randomly like that in front of the coffeeshop. Even another guy kept on bringing it up and how strange it was, because I usually talk about ""coincidences"" and this happened.

However, when this happened I did not truly thought it was a synchronicity, because these days people can easily listen in, and we had many texts, many phone calls. Some guy could listen in and knew what we were doing and sent someguy with a shirt. Honestly, it could had even been one of the friends I was with who wanted a play on my paranoia, but not too sure.

\*I kept on running into a parody one off, offshoot of a friend for a time period. I brought this friend at the time who did not notice any synchroncities, even if he were to look for it. I then saw an off shoot of a friend and showed him, he looked over and the other guy was slurping noodles soup while driving. We then kept on running into lookalikes and offshoots. We might talk about the football team with Samoans and in our area, there is not a lot of Samoans and suddenly we go somewhere and they were in line infront of us. But to highlight, we are not sure if they were samoans, but this synchronicity uses our knowledge of what a samoan might look like, or use some other culture that might not even be samoan but are similar.

Also he's a no nonsense guy if he does not see it. I have talked to him about other things and he would disagree with it if he does not agree. He said he never sees these on his own, but sees it with me.

I have many theories on why this might happen. I'd like to mention my first go to was human based gaslighting, but other experiences that go beyond just human realm, like dreams, coincidences, etc. Might make it something else. Technological?

1py1867,https://github.com/RookieEnough/Orion-Store,"[APP] An APP Store to download every Mod in just ONE Click, Yes it's Orion Store. Now more advance and useful.","Hey everyone,

The last time I posted here, Orion Store was basically a skeleton. It was version 1.0.0 a glorified list of links I put together because I was tired of hunting for ReVanced updates and modded APKs manually. It was buggy, it was bare-bones, but you guys actually liked it.

Since then, I’ve spent way too many late nights (and way too much coffee) pushing update after update. Today, I’m finally feeling proud enough to say that v1.0.8 is live, and it honestly feels like a real app store now.

If you haven't checked it out since the ""bare-bones"" days, here’s what’s changed:

**THE ""INTELLIGENCE"" UPGRADE:**
 now I have a native AppTracker plugin. It actually checks your phone to see what’s installed. No more guessing the store knows if you're up to date or if you need that fresh patch and notify the user to download the new update with Orion's native Notification support.

**THE VIBE (UI/UX):**
I’m a dark mode addict, so we’ve got 3 distinct themes now: Light (for the brave), Dusk (the sweet spot), and Dark/OLED (battery saver 3000). There’s even a ""Compact Mode"" if you like your data dense and a ""Performance Mode"" to force that buttery 144Hz scrolling.

**THE SETTINGS (Everything you asked for):**
I added a whole Control Center. WiFi-only downloads? Check. Auto-cleanup for installer APKs? Check. Auto-discovery for updates? Check. You can even hide the PC or TV tabs if you don't use them.

**GAMIFIED SUPPORT:**
I hate intrusive ads. So the store itself has ZERO ads. Instead, I built ""Fuel the Code."" It’s an optional RPG-style quest where you watch an ad to ""defeat glitches"" and ""save the dev."" You unlock hidden badges and lower your submission cooldowns. It’s been fun seeing people actually hit the final rank.

**ADD YOUR FAVOURITE APPS**
I’ve added a new option in the Orion Store that allows everyone to contribute to the Orion Library by submitting apps. Users have two ways to add apps:

1. Via Obtanium imports
2. Using direct repository links

After I manually review a submission, the app is instantly added to the Orion Store and becomes available for everyone to download. The initial cooldown for submitting apps is 3 hours, and it decreases as you make more submissions through a gamified ranking system.

**DATA SAVER:**
I refactored the entire backend fetch logic. Now it uses smart ETags, meaning if the app list hasn't changed on GitHub, the app downloads 0 KB. Your data plan can thank me later.

It’s still 100% open-source, serverless (powered by GitHub Actions), and just a passion project by a guy who loves clean code.

Thanks to everyone who reported bugs or suggested features in the early days. You guys turned this from a bare-bones experiment into something I use every single day.

Check it out if you want a clean, ad-free gateway to your favorite apps.

1py183c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1py183c/dont_really_know_what_i_expect_out_of_this/,Don't really know what I expect out of this,"So like the title says, not really sure of what I hope to get out of this but it drives me crazy. So quick timeline I (38 M) got out of the military in 2024 and moved back home with my kids and wife (38 F) of 18 years. so July 2024 we decide to get a house, close to 200k on cash down figured it wasn\`t the first house we got as a couple. 

May 2025 the wife wants a divorce, little no a lot blindsided by that still and I guess she had done all the mental gymnastic of it all because no interest of doing any therapy when I ask her why she still went throught the whole buying a house together she says that at that time there was no issue, keep in mind that was 10 months ago. 

Fastforward to beginning of December 2025 we meet for coffee and at the end slips in that she started seeing someone, that someone being a guy at the gym that she obviously knew, allbeit maybe not really well but definetly a little for the past year and a half that she has been going there but according to her there was no emotional connection whatsoever and wasn\`t planning on dating so soon after. She also mentions that when she made up her mind about the divorce that she felt that she didn't see any  futur for us.

First question, am I crazy to think that after 18 years to be dating 8 months after a divorce, well not even fully divouce yet?

Second, am I wrong to think that she is hyppocrite from going from, communication is the key to everything to go from between buying the house and 9 months later being fully checked out of the relationship.

Anyway, like I mentioned, I don't know what I am expecting of this thread, guess I really needed to put it down in writing or to at least talk about it because it's still not making any sense to me and as much as I always wanted her to be happy I can't ignore how miserable she is making me feel even if it's not on purpose.

I didn’t enjoy pregnancy and had a rough postpartum dealing with PPD, which I’m now through fortunately. I was never totally set on having kids and I wonder if the struggles I now face are due to that ‘on the fence about it’ feeling I always had. This is not to say I don’t love my daughter (shouldn’t need to confirm that but always fear people will think I don’t when I open up about these struggles), but I find parenting absolutely gruelling. In hindsight, my daughter was a very easy newborn because this early toddlerhood stage has been so rough in comparison. She has started having full blown tantrums, cries for what seems like nothing all of the time. Never seems happy with anything you do. I’ve always envisaged her being a bit older and doing girly things together like coffee and shopping dates. At present however, I just feel absolutely lost in these relentlessly tiring baby years. I guess I’m looking for people who felt similar and learnt to love parenthood more as their child grew and became more emotionally stable / independent. Any wise words would be much appreciated.
