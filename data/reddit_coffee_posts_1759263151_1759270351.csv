1nuqt7a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Interstitialcystitis/comments/1nuqt7a/cautiously_optimistic/,Cautiously Optimistic,"Quit caffeine (although I still drink decaf) and started hydroxyzine last week.  My urgency has chilled out some and frequency is also a bit less.  

I was only drinking typically 1 cup in the morning, sometimes another in the afternoon so it’s crazy that removing the caffeine has had such an effect so far?  I’m assuming it’s not the hydroxyzine because I’ve only been taking it for about 1 week.  And also not the acidity of the coffee because I’m still drinking decaf?

I also started going to PT for the fourth (yes, FOURTH) time just because my insurance covered it, so why not.  This PT is taking a totally different approach, focusing on relaxing AND strengthening instead of the stereotypical hypertonic-so-strengthening-of-any-kind-is-the-devil rigamarole.  

What I’ve tried so far:
- 3x pelvic PT, first round helped with painful sex, last 2 rounds were virtually useless
- oxytrol patches.  Worked for urgency maybe 40%, then stopped working.  Dried my vocal cords out too
- slippery elm, haven’t noticed much of a difference, but also I didn’t take it very long

I got my official diagnosis last week and will be going in for an ultrasound soon.  (Prior to this, my working diagnosis was hypertonic pelvic floor. 🙄)

1nuqs4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1nuqs4r/thoughts_on_poesies_upcoming_cryptids_and/,Thoughts on Poesie's upcoming Cryptids and returning fall favorites!,"With tremendous thanks again to Poesie for the press samples, I am utterly *delighted* to share with you all my thoughts on the three new Cryptids and the four returning fall favorites (two of which are beloved staples of my fall perfumes, and one of those is one of my true autumn holy grails!). All seven of these will be released tomorrow (Wednesday, October 1) as their ""Ghoul's Night"" collection, probably around noon Eastern Time since that has typically been their pattern (though I haven't seen an exact release time listed anywhere).

**My preferences:** I especially love snuggly scents, incense, golden amber, cardamom, black tea, beeswax, non-gourmand vanillas, and white florals (though sadly I am allergic to lilies and jasmine doesn’t usually work on me). I ADORE Poesie’s cardamom and black tea notes! I don't like hay, overly sweet gourmands, butter notes, excessive musk, leather, dragon’s blood, patchouli, labdanum, or any really dark scents in general.

These were press samples provided in exchange for an honest review.

# Cryptids

First thing I noticed: oh look, they all have black tea! Poesie has some of the *best* black tea scents!

**Jersey Devil** \[Black tea, a forest of pine and cedar, sun-baked pine needles, dragon's blood incense, moss, coastal mist\] - I'm getting sun-baked dirt, dried pine wood, and the reddish, peppery tang of dragon's blood incense. This is incredibly atmospheric; not in the way that I want to smell, but I appreciate the craft here even if it's not a direction that I personally enjoy. Sniffed *right* up close, I get a sort of misty fog effect too, but that's not part of the sillage wafting around me. Sadly, I don't sense any black tea at all, which is a bummer because I really love Poesie's black tea note. If you liked the pine needles in **Sacagawea** \[Wild blackberries, a blanket of warm pine needles in a quiet grove of old growth trees, river water, ethically sourced white sage essential oil, soft skin musk\], this has a similar outdoorsy feel but is significantly witchier. That being said, though it is a darker scent than **Sacagawea**, **Jersey Devil** does dry down fairly quickly to be fairly skin-hugging itself, and the dragon's blood ends up smelling more like a gentle cinnamon (and absolutely no cinnamon skin reaction).

**Mothman** \[Red musk, black tea, tobacco leaf, warm nutmeg, an ancient mountain forest, spiced amber\] - This is incredibly *warming* \- malty black tea with cream, spiced nutmeg musk, a prominent and earthy though not dirty or smoky tobacco, and clay. After a moment, some evergreen notes start to poke their heads out, and then a bit later, the green and mentholic evergreen tree note is joined by a whole garage-full of dried wood. (My husband is a woodworker; ask me how I know what a garage full of wood smells like!)

**Nessie** \[Black tea, buttery Scottish shortbread biscuits, lakewater, highland heather, peat smoke\] - Poesie does a really great shortbread cookie note, musky and sweet and buttery but not smelling like literal butter (I really hate butter notes). Here the shortbread is the most prominent note I smell, combined with a cup of tea with cream, or rather, to my nose, that order is reversed - a cup of warm cream with a splash of black tea. That black tea is a robust Irish Breakfast or similar - not as smoky as an Oolong but bolder than, say, an Earl Grey. Joining the shortbread and creamy tea is a brackish and almost leathery lakewater note, which keeps this scent from simply being a teatime gourmand. If you like their **Jane Austen** \[Malty black tea, vanilla shortbread cookies, a stack of old books, a fireplace, a promise of orange blossom\] I think you'd love this.

All three of these Cryptids are really quite similar in their atmospheric, outdoorsy, autumnal effect. If you like one I think you'll like the others, though I find myself a little bit puzzled why, with such a small three-scent collection, they didn't evoke more range. On the other hand, this collection is such an unusual departure from their usual pastel-gourmandy vibe, and they make really great use of Poesie's amazing black tea note (even if none of the three is my favorite approach to a black-tea scent, since each one has some notes \[dragon's blood, red musk, tobacco, lakewater, peat smoke\] that aren't my thing). I always, always recommend Poesie anytime someone asks about good black tea perfumes, and this set of Cryptids is a really interesting approach that should appeal to the more outdoorsy among us. And they're great for fall!

# Returning Fall Favorites

**Black Cat Cuddles** \[Sweet coconut milk spiked with clove, cinnamon & black pepper, incense-dusted fur, flecks of black vanilla bean, a distant pine forest\] - Oh this is cool! I get a beautiful balance between dark green pine trees, almost sparkly incense, and that coconut milk. As it dries, the spices amp up to join the coconut milk and pine. Personally I would call this atmospheric rather than snuggly, though I know a lot of folks consider this to be a really cuddly perfume. I'm so glad to have it in my collection! It's not going in the ""autumn cozy"" section of my fall perfumes, though - I'll wear this on days when I want a more atmospheric scent, with outfits in shades of dark blues and greens to play up the trees. (I have a blackwatch plaid dress that I think will be *perfect* with this!) For evergreen + incense from Poesie, I still prefer **Glittering Bough** \[Creamy French vanilla, frosted branches of balsam fir, church incense\], liking the French vanilla more than the strongly-buttery coconut milk here in **Black Cat Cuddles**. If you like their old **Annie Jump Cannon** \[Cool night air, star anise + nutmeg, twinkling golden resins, a milky swath of vanilla stars\], you'd love this.

**Introvert Ghost** (originally released as **Introverted Ghost**) \[Chai tea with extra cardamom, a cozy stack of old books, marshmallow, sweet pumpkin flesh enrobed in warm pumpkin spice\] - Pumpkin and chai spices with EXTRA CARDAMOM, over the Poesie marshmallow base? AMAZING! And this scent truly lives up to its promise. I fell madly in love with it in fall 2022 when it first came out, and wore it so much that the following year I upsized to a FS. It remains one of my holy-grail autumn favorites! Marshmallow and pumpkin make a fluffy, creamy base. Above it are beautiful baking spices (fellow cardamom lovers will want to know that cardamom is definitely here, but not nearly as prominent as in **Cardigan** or **Comfort** or **Cozy**). The ""old books"" notes is here as a strongly-present but gentle and velvety leather. I'm not one for leather notes, but Poesie has convinced me that theirs works for me, in **Tempus Fugit** \[Precious sandalwood, spilled blackberry wine, wheels of golden amber, antique lace, a forgotten rose pressed in the pages of an ancient leather-bound book\] especially, and also in **Myself Invisible** \[Stacked books, spilled ink, black tea, shy violets hiding deep in the forest\]. **Introvert Ghost** blooms beautifully over the next few hours, the creamy pumpkin coming a bit more forward. It's a gorgeous cozy autumnal scent. If you like **Arcana Coven** \[The nostalgic, Autumnal essence of a magical sisterhood blessed by the crone goddess Hecate. Warmly roasted pumpkin, French vanilla, cozy cashmere shawls, dead leaves, hay bales, a soft brush of kitten whiskers, and the rustle of black skirts\] you'd love this.

**Salty Ghost** \[Marauding marshmallows, spiced rum, an oak gangplank, grey amber\] - The plush, powdered-sugary marshmallow base of all of Poesie's Ghosts is joined here by a boozy note, heavy on the cinnamon and orange peel and oak-barrel cask (which now that I've written that, makes me think probably I'd read this as whisky if it hadn't specifically said rum) and a touch of sea salt (though that might be the power of suggestion from the name). Poesie's grey amber is a curious note, one that also shows up in their **Rich Ghost** \[Iso E Super, ruby red grapefruit, rich sandalwood, golden threads of saffron, a hint of jasmine perfume, grey musk, warm amber, marshmallow\]. That grey musk is somehow simultaneously a little bit dirty, a little bit musty and animalic, yet also elegant (???). It's a note that drips with power and exudes confidence. To be honest I'm not sure it entirely goes with the innocent sweetness of the marshmallow here. I suppose this is one of the more ""grown up"" of the Ghosts, though if I want a little bit of darkness with my marshmallow, I prefer their **Wicked Ghost** \[Innocent marshmallow encompassed in glowing black amber and resinous incense smoke\]. I wonder why they chose just *this* Ghost (and not **Wicked Ghost** or **Hungry Ghost** or **Campfire Ghost** or **Forest Ghost** or **Wakeful Ghost** or the maximally-cozy-autumnal **Shy Ghost**) to come back as one of this year's fall favorites? (**Rich Ghost**, **Sleepy Ghost**, and **Library Ghost** are part of their permanent collection already.)

**Solar Witch** \[Coffee, crisp autumn air, apple cider donuts, sunflowers, warm sandalwood, a faint whisper of hearth fire\] - Another of my fall favorites! And I say that as a person who doesn't normally love coffee notes! This is just *that good*. Milky, sweetened coffee paired with Poesie's gorgeous warm sandalwood and yes indeed, those are unmistakeably apple cider donuts (not just ""apples""), with just a hint of yeasty cake donut and that sprinkle of cinnamon sugar. The sandalwood plus the other warm notes are quite reminiscent of **Amaterasu** \[Golden sandalwood incense, rice milk, bright cardamom, amber, dry wheat, and sunflowers\] but without the toasted grains note, and of course plus the chocolatey coffee. Occasional faint whiffs of smoke from a distant bonfire on a crisp autumn day complete this evocative and joyful seasonal atmospheric. I was *really* hoping this one would come back this year, so yay! If you like Sorce's **Falling Stars** variants, I think you'd really like this; though they're not at all dupes they all have a similar vibe (and, of course, they share the coffee notes!).",1,1759270007.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False

It doesn’t have to be formal, more like a relaxed conversation where we can exchange knowledge and support each other.

We could start with just one session to see how it goes, and if people find it useful, maybe turn it into something regular.

2. She needs to build comfort over text

As a guy I tried doing it #2 for years and I got tons of flaking, ghosting, and wasted energy. 

I feel a lot better since I went with option 1. I waste less time texting ( I hate texting strangers and people in general. I’m an in person and phone call person) and at my age (29) you either know or you don’t in my opinion. 

If a lady  is uncomfortable meeting within 2-3 days of matching I always offer a phone call to build comfort but if they are solely wanting to text for comfort I always tell them I’m uninterested. 

If your boundary is “comfort”  but a phone call or meeting for coffee in public is scary and feel a couple texts will make it better and mine is not wasting my time texting then we’re not compatible.

I am a 34 year old woman, last year in August my mother was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic lung cancer and it was a huge shock to the system. I think she was sick for a while because she had been coughing for years. She lived close to my work and in the winter, I'd stay at her place on days when the weather was messy or slippery or if I left work too late to take the bus home. 

She declined quickly from there and in October she was admitted into the hospital. Just a few days later, I got the call at lunch that I needed to get there immediately, she didn't have much time left and it was time to say goodbye. 

I called an Uber and sat in the back of Uber, crying uncontrollably. My partner called and asked which room and what I needed. I told her the room and said I needed a coffee and a chocolate chip muffin and then I told her not to rush, she was in a meeting out of town and probably wouldn't make it in time and to just meet me back at my mom's place around supper time with it.

I got to my mom's room, and spoke to the nurse and doctor for a minute before I went back to mom's room and cried uncontrollably by her side (I tried to stop but couldn't). 

I don't know when he did it but there was a coffee and chocolate chip muffin sitting on the table and a note telling me my ride had been refunded and condolences. Cue more tears but to this day, I still remember that and the simple compassion and hugs I got from the staff. 

But that coffee meant so much to me. I wish I could have rated that driver on a higher scale. He might not realize how much the simple gesture meant but I will always remember and be grateful. ",1,1759269813.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

1nuqn8m,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseSharingStories/comments/1nuqn8m/the_great_living_room_takeover_and_how_we_fought/,The Great Living Room Takeover and How We Fought Back,"I swear, for a solid two weeks, our living room looked like a natural disaster had exclusively targeted the couch and coffee table. I was lowkey losing my mind. Every time I walked in, it was a new mountain of forgotten mugs, discarded Amazon packages, and someone’s random gym bag. NGL, I was ready to snap. It wasn't just messy; it was actively making our small urban apartment feel even smaller.

It started subtly. Maya, bless her creative soul, would leave her sketchbooks and paintbrushes scattered after a late-night burst of inspiration. Liam, our resident tech guru, had a habit of leaving charging cables and empty energy drink cans everywhere. And Chloe, my super-social, always-on-the-go housemate, would treat the coffee table as a temporary landing strip for her keys, mail, and a rotating cast of takeout containers. I felt like I was the only one *actually* putting things away. I’d try passive-aggressive tidying, moving things to their owners' doors, but honestly, it barely made a dent. My internal monologue was just a constant stream of ""Seriously? Again?""

The breaking point came when I couldn't find my headphones anywhere. I needed them for an important work call, and they were gone, swallowed by the living room abyss. I checked under blankets, inside forgotten backpacks, even under a pile of Chloe's clean (but unfolded) laundry. That’s when I finally messaged the group chat: ""House meeting, tonight. 7 PM. Kitchen table. Don't be late."" I was nervous, my hands literally shaking as I typed. I hate confrontation, but this was beyond a minor inconvenience now; it was impacting my ability to, like, live.

To their credit, they all showed up. The air was thick with a mix of awkwardness and, I think, a bit of guilt. I took a deep breath. ""Okay, so, look,"" I started, trying to keep my voice even, ""I love you guys, for real, but the living room and kitchen are getting out of control. I couldn't find my headphones today because of all the clutter, and it’s just… a lot."" Maya immediately looked down, and Liam shuffled his feet. Chloe, though, was the first to speak up. ""You know what? That’s so valid, I’m sorry. I get so swamped, I just drop stuff and forget it."" Liam chimed in, ""Yeah, tbh, I totally forget whose turn it is for kitchen duty sometimes, and I just kinda… put it off."" Maya admitted that her creative chaos sometimes bled into communal spaces.

We talked for almost an hour. We decided on a rotating weekly chore chart for the common areas – no exceptions. We also set up a ""communal items"" basket where anything left out for more than 24 hours would go, and you had to retrieve it by the end of the week or it was fair game for donation. It felt like a small win. Over the next few weeks, there were still forgotten mugs, but way fewer. The living room started to breathe again. We even started having movie nights on our now-clear couch. It was proof that sometimes, the hardest conversations lead to the best outcomes, and our little apartment felt more like a home, finally.

1nuqkz0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nuqkz0,My sleep onset central apnea is ruining my life. Please help me.,"Starting over two years ago before I got my CPAP, it was extremely obvious that I got obstructive apnea basically overnight. Three doctors told me it was just anxiety until I found a fourth one to finally give me a sleep study.

I got my CPAP over a year ago and it was like magic. I don’t even have any obstructive apneas anymore really. But ever since this spring when I moved, I will stop breathing immediately as I’m falling asleep. I will lay there barely falling asleep repeatedly for 12 hours. These spells come and go for weeks at a time. Then I’ll be better for just awhile.

Currently I take anxiety medicine at night because of it, and even that doesn’t knock me out to cover the pain. It’s now becoming so bad, that my nervous system causes pain throughout my stomach area as soon as I lay down in bed. The nerve pain doesn’t come every time, but regardless my entire body jerks awake and panics every time I’m falling asleep. I’m afraid to try drifting off, because I know I’ll immediately stop breathing and become startled with a racing heart.

I first got diagnosed with 0 central apneas. Now it’s all I have. Maybe it doesn’t look like much at first, but it happens the moment I’m falling asleep. Do I need to get a bipap or something now? Which will take many months. I can’t hold job more than a few hours because of this and I don’t get up until 3 pm. It’s making me unable to control my anger I have around sleep. And the longer I “just get up and do something for 15 minutes”, the worse it gets when I go back to bed. I only ever use the room for sleep really, but maybe the anxiety that place brings only makes it worse now that I think about it…

Yes, I’ve made many appointments. No, I can’t see a psychiatrist nor a sleep doctor nor a neurologist for many months away. I was prescribed anxiety shit that’s basically Benadryl and makes me tired the next day with only 1/2 pill. I have 3 Xanax pills leftover from when they told me my OSA is just anxiety, but I’m afraid to take a fraction of for some reason. I may try it tonight, but don’t know what to do after that. 

The nerve pain is a bit better once I’m awake and it’s much worse when I try to close my eyes. I quit coffee 2/3 days ago to see, and I also just got -unwelcomed- from my job Sunday night on top of everything. My 30th birthday is in one week and I’m laying here crying, as my health has gotten me to accomplish nothing in life. I could’ve had so much more if it wasn’t for this I feel. After moving here in the spring, I could’ve made friends, maybe have a party, but a social life was too draining after I wouldn’t get a second of sleep all night, so I had to let those people go. My husband is a blessing and tried to help, this morning he brought me flowers and “Dormin sleep aid pills”, which is also just Benadryl lol.

My rant is over, someone please tell me what to do.",1,1759269528.0,SleepApnea,0,1.0,False
1nuqky7,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1nuqky7/creepypasta_oc_story_thing/,Creepypasta oc story thing,"Hiya! Just finished my oc lore story :D, I’m not a writer but I hope you guys like it! I really don’t know where to upload this so I’m putting it here  


This will be a fresh start. That’s what his mom said before dropping him off at her not very close friend’s house. Oskar’s parents had just gotten divorced and both his parents apparently decided dumping him with some random family is better than just dealing with taking care of him themselves. Though, after being forced to be an audience to their constant fighting, he’s too emotionally drained to think about the fact they dumped him like trash. Maybe this is what being a teenager is about, so much for 13 being a good age! Maybe his mom lies about everything. That’s all he can think as he steps closer to the house, clutching a backpack that only carried some clothes and a photo of his old ‘happy family’. 

  


“Oskar!” A woman steps through the door, she has colorfully dyed hair and looks to be in her thirties. “.. hey.” He answers back and lets out a pitiful sigh. “Come on in! This is gonna be your new home!” He almost gags. He doesn’t want a ‘new home’! He wants his normal one, the one he’s used to! He steps through the door and takes in the house.. it doesn’t look too bad, definitely cleaner than his. He tries his best to ignore the fact he has to start talking to new people.. terrifying.. he hates talking to anyone, especially new ones! This is starting to look like it’s going to turn out to be his personal hell. 

A man enters the room, he has blond hair and big glasses. “Oh! I forgot to say, my name is Ava and this is Jess!” The woman, apparently named Ava, exclaims. “Charlotte, come here!” She calls out and he can hear quick footsteps. A girl emerges from the hallway next to the TV, she has blond hair and glasses as well, well that makes three of them.. god, why is he including himself with these people? Anyway, she seems to be about his age but is way less awkward than he is. “Oh, hey, I’m Charlie or just Charlotte, either works.” She states and smiles. “Hey.. uh.. I’m.. Oskar..” He gives an awkward nod. “Okay! Charlotte, Oskar will be staying in your room with you, alright?” “Mhm.” The parents quickly shoo Oskar and Charlotte out of the room, she leads him to the bedroom and they both enter. “So.. uh..” He sits on the bed and tries his best to find a topic to fill the silence. “.. do um.. do you like drawing..?” She nods. Cool, they have something in common, maybe this won’t be so hard. 

  


Over the course of a few years Oskar gets used to living with this family, they start to feel like \*his\* family, especially Charlie, she’s taken the role of a sister he didn’t have originally. He became the closest with Charlie, often staying up just to talk and share stories. This specific night they were planning for their future, as they often did, planning on running away to live together away from the stresses of the life they have now. Charlie was so happy, he thought, how could she be unhappy with her life? He didn’t mind that she wanted to live with him when they were older, he was excited about it even.. but he just doesn’t understand. It doesn’t seem like she has any mental issues either, at least not the ones that had began to sprout lately. He had been diagnosed with bipolar and autism for some time but recently had gotten a schizophrenia diagnosis. The hallucinations weren’t the worst part, it was the paranoia, the fear that there was something.. someone watching him through the trees. 

  


“Oskar? Are you listening?” He blinks a few times, he must have zoned out again. “Oh, yeah, haha.. sorry.” He leans back. “Hey, y’know I just thought about uh.. what do you wanna get for your birthday? Uhh, asking for a friend.” She chuckles. “You don’t have any friends.” “Geez.” He rolls his eyes. “\*But\*, I think we should go camping.” He pauses. “Camping? For your 16th? Who?” “Me and you! Obviously!” “Oh.” He tucks his arms behind his head and falls back against the pillows. “You never seemed like a camping type.” She lays down next to him, both of them staring up at the ceiling. “I was thinking.. maybe we could get an apartment together, just the two of us.. wouldn’t that be nice?” She looks over at him hopefully. “An apartment?” He chuckles with surprise. “And where are you getting this money to afford it?” She looks back at the ceiling. “There’s an area that’s down in the more y’know.. like wooded area of town that has free space \*and\* there’s businesses who are looking for employees!” He sighs. “Dude, we can’t just leave, who’s gonna sell an apartment to teenagers? That’s like.. the number one landlord no go.” He scoffs. “And, how’d we get here from talking about camping?” “Because, we could like.. say we’re going camping and run away! Isn’t that the dream?” He looks to the other side of the room. “I just.. the forest makes me uncomfortable..” “Uncomfortable?” “.. yeah” -He sighs- “it feels like.. there’s…” He trails off. “It doesn’t matter, I just think this is a dumb idea.” “Awhhhh, cmon! Pleeeeeasssseeee???” “Fine! Fine! But just know that I don’t approve.” They both turn to look at each other at the same time before bursting into laughter. Suddenly Oskar begins to cough. “Hah- fuck, are you okay?” Charlie continues to laugh. “No-“ He coughs again. “Fuck! Kill me, god..” It takes about a minute for him to stop. “Anyway.. let’s talk about your crazy escaping fantasy in the morning because I am TIRED.” “Me too, haha, I was staying up to talk to you.” “Really?” “Really.” He stuffs his face into a pillow. “Well that’s stupid.” “Thanks.” She stands up and flops down on the bed across the room from his. 

  


He’s sitting on the couch with his mom watching a movie, the air is warm and smells like fall. He’s always loved spending time with his mom, though it’s been hard now that she works more. He doesn’t like to be left with his dad.. though he shouldn’t think about that right now. He wants to just enjoy the moment. He leans his head against her shoulder. “Hey Oskar?” He looks at her. “Yeah?” “Oskar.” “What?” “Oskar! Come on, get up already!” 

His eyes shoot open to reveal Charlie roughly shaking his arm.. just a dream. It almost makes him sad, but he can’t be sad in front of her. “Yeah, yeah, give me a minute.” He sighs and runs a hand down his face. “Where’s my glasses?” “Oh, you fell asleep with ‘em on so I put them in the case.” “Thanks..” He takes the case from her and puts them on. “Geez, I always forget how shitty my vision is until I don’t have these.” 

  


He spends around 30 minutes getting ready while Charlie decides to make breakfast. 

He exits the bedroom and enters the kitchen. “Soo, one or two?” He looks at her. “What?” “One or two eggs, you idiot.” He chuckles. “Geez, uhhh.. one.” “Okay.” He opens the fridge, grabbing a cup of water that was left overnight and taking a large gulp. “Mhh, tastes like fridge.” 

After breakfast they make their way back to the bedroom, Charlie quickly flings open the door. “We only have so much time until mom gets back so we should make our plan now.” Oskar jumps down onto the bed, producing a loud creak that he winces at. “Oops— anyway, what plan?” “Do you forget everything the second after it happens? The camping thing!” “Ohhh, yeah.”

  


Somehow an hour seems to pass by without him knowing, when he realizes it, what happened in said hour completely disappears from his mind. He doesn’t want to mention it so he nods to whatever sentence she was finishing. “Oskar? Are you good?” Charlie asks with concern. “What? I’m fine.” “Your nose is bleeding!” “What?” He raises a hand to his face.. huh, his nose \*is\* bleeding.. “Shit, I’ll be right back.” He quickly stands up and heads to the bathroom. 

He looks in the mirror, he hasn’t really looked at himself lately, maybe he should. He gives himself a good look, he has fluffy shoulder length brown hair and brown eyes. He has glasses with a sloppy looking X drawn with permanent marker on one of the lenses that he apparently thought was a good idea when he was younger. And of course his favorite blue hoodie that he’s had as long as he can remember… which isn’t very far in the past, odd.. he doesn’t even know if he remembers looking like this. “What’s happening to me..?” He decides to just get this bathroom trip over with and quickly wash the blood off his face. He notes in his head to not look in the mirror again, at least not too soon.

  


The day seems to slip right by him once again, like a ghost standing behind you in a mirror just for you to turn and see no one there. One second he’s listening to Charlie talk about this big runaway plan he’s hesitantly agreed on, and the next second he’s drawing alone on the floor of his shared bedroom. 

He’s found himself drawing creatures lately.. or demons? No, he doesn’t want to call them that, that’s stupid. 

He laughs quietly at the thought. The drawing is done already, the thing on the paper somewhat resembling him but with strange stretched out proportions and stringy hair. His phone buzzes, interrupting the music he didn’t realize he was listening to, it’s still Alex G, at least in his weird dream state or whatever it is he still has taste. The buzzing turns out to be a text from Charlie, “Its going good!! Thanks for asking!!! :D” -He pauses and lets out a slightly too loud- “What?” He goes to his messages just to see they had a long conversation before he zoned in, oh, she’s at a party. Parties were never his thing, makes sense why she didn’t seem to invite him then. He responds with, “Of course” and turns off his phone. Maybe he should get some sleep, It’d be good for him. He glances at the window, the house faces a small patch of forest that is visible through it. He tenses when he sees something, a figure. He quickly turns his head to look at the floor. “Nope- nope- I’m NOT doing this.” He holds his breath without even realizing for a moment before beginning to cough again. What is wrong with him? He forces himself to his feet before collapsing onto the bed and finally ceasing the painful coughing. “I hate everything..” He curls up into a ball and closes his eyes, feeling something warm and wet dripping down his face but ignoring it. 

  


He finds himself in a forest.. that doesn’t make sense, he’s always been afraid of going in the woods, why would he be here now? He tries to rationalize what’s going on with the excuse of it just being the common zoning out but it still doesn’t make sense why he would go in the woods anyway. He’s never gone out of his house when it happens.. why now? His thoughts are interrupted by the sound of whispers. He quickly flings his head from side to side to try to find the source. He finds his body becoming paralyzed, stuck looking at one of the tall trees. He can feel something slithering onto his body, like a snake or a rope, it slowly wraps around his neck and begins to tighten. He tries to struggle but he can’t move his body. He starts to hear a loud sound, like a loud ringing noise accompanied by TV static, it makes his ears bleed. He starts to cry, it feels like he’s going to die. 

Before he blacks out he wakes up, his face was stuffed into his pillows.. he sits up and sees that there’s blood covering the white material, staining it red in some places. “Shit.. I need to clean this up..” His head throbs and his vision is blurry.

He groggily sits up and looks at the clock next to his bed, 4:45 AM.. why isn’t Charlie home yet? He instantly starts to worry, what if she’s in trouble? What if she’s in danger? \*What if she’s dead\*? No, she’s not dead, he’s just overreacting, he needs to focus on scrubbing out all the red off of this pillow as fast as he can. He grabs it and exits the room, bumping into walls as he makes his way to the bathroom. He keeps his eyes on the sink while ripping the case off the pillow and shoving it into the sink. He drops the pillow on the ground and starts the faucet. He opens up the soap dispenser and dumps it in the sink water and begins to roughly scrub it with his hands. He does it for about thirty minutes before draining the sink and seeing what it looks like.. to his dismay the case is now completely dyed an odd shade of reddish pink. Maybe nobody will notice? That’s what he hopes. He rings out the towel and his eyes accidentally make their way back up to the mirror. He has a bad habit of sleeping with his glasses still on, there’s some blood on them but there’s blood all over his face too. He sets the case on the side of the sink and rubs some water on his face to get it all off. “Disgusting..” He rubs off the blood that was left on the sink off with a towel and walks back to his room. 

  


He doesn’t even realize he fell asleep until he feels Charlie shaking him again. “Oskar! Hey!” He sits up. “What..?” “What’s with the pillow?” He freezes, did he leave that in the bathroom? “Uhhh, what pillow?” “The one that was on the floor!” She throws it onto the bed. “What happened while I was gone?” She sighs. “You used all the soap too! What’s with yo-“ “I’m sorry, okay? I had a rough night.” She pauses. “Alright, just.. clean it up next time, okay?” “.. yeah.” He stands up on shaky legs and moves to lean against the wall next to the door. “Um.. how was that party?” She gives him a worried look but answers his question anyway. “Uh, it was good.. are you okay?” He tenses uncomfortably. “Yeah, yeah! Why.. wouldn’t I be?” Honestly he felt like he was going to dissolve into a puddle of fleshy goo onto the floor but he of course doesn’t say that. “Hey.. where’s Ava? I thought you said she’d be home yesterday?” She tilts her head slightly. “What? I told you she’d be gone about a week longer, were you even listening to me?” Oops, he shouldn’t have said that. “Yeah- yeah, I was.. um.. haha.. I-I just forgot for a second.” He shifts uncomfortably. “Listen, um.. I might go to the park today so, um..” What? Why did he say that? “Oh, cool!” She lightens up slightly. “How long do you think you’re gonna be gone? “Uh.. just an hour or something, yeah.. I’m gonna go now.” “Now? But you just woke up.” “Hey, um.. early bird gets the worm or whatever.. haha, um.. yeah bye.” He quickly exits the room and speed walks to the front door. Maybe he’d do anything to get away from a situation that makes him uncomfortable, even if the other option isn’t so good either. 

  


He walks to the park with his head down and his mind somewhere else. He doesn’t know where he goes when time skips he just knows it happens way too often now. It takes him a moment to realize he’s sitting on a bench and drawing again. This time it’s just a house, well it’s more of a mansion, it looks run down. He wonders why he picked this, it’s not really in line with what he normally does. A shiver runs down his spine for no apparent reason, it makes his head involuntarily roll backwards. He hates when this happens, it’s so annoying and can sometimes bring unwanted attention. He cracks his neck and observes his surroundings. There’s only a few people here, good. There’s someone walking their dog and someone smoking while leaning against a tree.. gross. He doesn’t judge people on what they do but he never really understood it. They look up at him and he quickly looks back down at his notebook. 

He takes about five minutes of awkwardly drawing over already made lines until he decides they looked away and stands up. Hopefully it’s been long enough for him to go back home. His walk back wasn’t blurry this time, though he didn’t do much with his clarity. He stared at trees and awkwardly avoided joggers who came in his path. 

Once he finally gets back home he walks to the kitchen, grabbing a bottle of water from the fridge and chugging it. He hears Charlie enter but he doesn’t open his eyes until he’s done. He turns to her…? No, there’s no one there.. huh, odd, but not too alarming. He walks back to the bedroom to see Charlie on her bed with her phone. “Oh, hey, you’re back.” She looks up at him. 

“We should leave soon.” Wait what? “What? Today? Why?” “Do I gotta remind you every time? For the apartment thing! I’ve been saving up for this for so long and all we gotta do is both get jobs and we can finally live together! Both of us! Isn’t that great?” “What? You don’t even have a contra-“ “I do! This is really gonna be perfect!” “Oh.. but.. right now?” “No, soon, you should get ready.” “Um.. okay..” He nods awkwardly and goes to grab his old backpack. “Are you sure this is a good idea? I mean..” He flinches when he feels a hand on his shoulder, geez, she got up fast. She gives him a reassuring smile. “This is a step in the right direction, a fresh start!” Yeah. This will be a fresh start. She’s right, he shouldn’t be worried. “Okay.. yeah.. um.. what should I bring?” She looks around the room for a moment. “You don’t really have much.. just bring whatever you think you need, we’re not moving too far so it won’t be too y’know.. drastic.” He nods. “Okay, just give me a few.” 

He packs as much of his stuff as he can, which turns out to be about all of it, he really doesn’t own much. He drags the two bags he has with him to the door, Charlie’s already stuffing all her stuff in the backseats of her car. “Um.. are you sure we should just leave without telling anyone..?” He walks next to her and throws his stuff in along with hers. “It’s not like they’ll care too much anyway, y’know?” She laughs. “Now let’s get this show on the road! Don’t worry, mister anxiety, I’m driving.” She smiles and gets into the car. “Cool.. cool..” He gets in and stares out the window. “This.. are you sure this is a good idea..?” “Yes! Come on, when have I steered you wrong?” He glances at her. “Yeah, you’re right..” 

And with that they begin the drive to their new home, the drive is pretty uneventful, only consisting of the average bad driver that makes his heart rate spike for a minute but not much else.

  


He’s straddling someone, he can’t understand any of their features to be able to tell who they are, and stabbing them in the stomach over and over. It’s happening without his control, all he can do is watch as it happens. He feels like he’s going to throw up.. it’s too much for him to handle, he doesn’t want to be a murderer! The blood coats his hands and he tears up.. this is like a horror movie..

He’s jostled awake when the car parks. At least that dream ended quickly.. “We’re here!” Charlie calls out. “Uh huh..” He leans back and stretches. “I’m excited..” She smiles. “Me too.” 

  


They arrive in front of the door of their new apartment, their new start. “This is it..” Oskar remarks with a sense of suspense. He presses one of his hands against the room temperature wood and gently pushes… nothing happens. He laughs. “I’m such an idiot.” He turns the handle and gently opens the door. The room isn’t anything spectacular but he’s never had an apartment so he can’t judge. Charlie runs in and bounces up and down while making a face like she’s resisting the urge to squeal. “Isn’t it great?” Oskar chuckles and joins her in looking around. “Yeah, it’s good.” He walks into the bedroom. “You should sleep in here, I’ll sleep on the couch.” She walks in behind him. “Whhhaatt??” “Dude, you bought the place.” “Okay, but just because you want to.” “Yeah, alright.” 

  


The night is mostly filled with unpacking and decorating, Oskar left most of the decorating to Charlie and just got his stuff put where it should be. Finally when they finished he could pass out on the couch and deal with getting a job tomorrow.

  


About six months later they both have jobs and are both fully situated. Oskar enjoys living out here more than he expected, maybe he was wrong for doubting Charlie.

He awakens to the sound of his alarm clock. Monday again.. great. He gets up and quickly scrambles to find his uniform, quickly throwing it on and running out the door. He makes it out of the apartment complex at around 6:30 AM, bright and early. While he’s walking he starts to hear soft footsteps behind him, he looks back multiple times but the streets are empty..? He stops to check his phone and he feels something metal thwack against the back of his head, knocking him out instantly.

  


He wakes up to find that he’s in what looks to be an old basement, his hands are behind his back and are chained to a pole. His head throbs and he feels like he’s going to throw up. He struggles against the chains until someone enters the room. “Woke up, huh?” Oskar tenses and looks away from them. “Listen, I’ll spell this out for you quick and easy, I need you for ransom, got it?” His eyes widen. “.. wh-what..?” His voice cracks and he looks up at them. “I think it’s pretty easy to understand.” “.. I.. I..” “Shut it!” They move in front of him and roughly throw his head back against the pole. “You want me to gag you?” They do it again. “Answer me when I’m talking to you!” “I-I don’t, I’m sorry!” “Good.” They kick him in the stomach before exiting the room.

  


Charlie had gotten back from work kind of late today and decided just to sit on the couch and wait for Oskar, he usually gets back at around this time so she won’t have to wait too long. They planned to have a movie night today, she got some snacks and everything! She starts to worry when he doesn’t show up when he usually does, she \*really\* starts to worry when the sun sets and he’s not back. Oskar isn’t the type of person to go out and he doesn’t have any friends so where could he be..? She calls his phone and waits. “Sorry, the person you have dialed is not….” She hangs up. He’s okay, he has to be, she knows he is.

  


The days and weeks start to blur together as Oskar’s captor begins to be more violent, slowly getting more angry at the money they do not have. He’s covered in dried blood and cuts, the feeling of it is disgusting. Every so often the come in the basement to take a photo, he doesn’t know why but he’s too worn out to really care. He feels lucky that he tends to fall out of reality now, waking up with gashes is better than being present when they happen.. at least in his opinion. He sometimes wonders if the outside world even cares if he’s gone, if anyone notices. Probably not, he’s just one person who isn’t even famous or anything, the public only really cares about famous or rich people. His eyes have gotten used to the darkness, if he ever does get out they’d have a hard time getting used to the sun again. But he probably won’t get out, they’ll just kill him once they deem that they can’t squeeze any money out of his family.

  


Charlie started obsessing over trying to find her brother, I mean who wouldn’t? She’s been getting sent unmarked boxes that are filled with photos of him beaten and bloody and has been taping them all over her wall. Shes tried her best to not let her desperation get the best of her and instead just focus on finding him but.. it’s been getting harder now that he’s been gone so long. Shes given some of the photos to the police but secretly kept most of them as she doesn’t believe they’re doing that good of a job, but honestly both of them haven’t found any more evidence at all. Sometimes she dreams of Oskar and her spending time together, then she wakes up and sobs until her throat goes dry, today is one of those days. “Please.. please I’m sorry, I’m sorry for making you move here.. just.. please come back.. it’s all my fault.. just..” She stuffs her face into a pillow and closes her eyes tightly, maybe if she pretends hard enough she can believe it never happened, that he’s still here.. but she can’t, she knows she can’t. She knows that her attempts are futile. She knows that it’s all her fault.

  


Ten months. That’s how long Oskar’s been gone. Charlie feels gross for feeling bad for herself when she knows Oskar has it worse but she can’t help it. Shes lost her friends and almost lost her job because she’s just been focusing on looking for him, the world moves on.. but for her it’s stopped. Her clock has stopped but the world’s keeps going, it’s not fair. She’s started throwing the boxes away, she can’t stand to look at the photos anymore, each batch is worse than the last. She can’t comprehend how the police haven’t found anything, how could they give up on her case? She feels hatred towards everyone but him.. maybe even him too in some weird way.. no, that’s not right.. is it? That’s terrible, she can’t think that. 

She’s drinking coffee in the kitchen but it does nothing to make her less tired, she needs to sleep. She drops the cup into the sink and walks slowly back to her bedroom. She makes eye contact with herself in a mirror that’s hung on the wall.. god, does she look like that? She takes a step forward. She’s got weird eye bags and slightly red eyes, her hair is tangled and knotted in some places and she looks like she could pass out right now.. which she actually could, she’s very tired. She manages to throw herself onto the bed before passing out. She dreams of Oskar once again. 

  


Charlie’s now messaging her boss about once again not being into work, she doesn’t understand how her brother being kidnapped isn’t a valid excuse but she still has this conversation with her again. It’s more like an argument that’s just passive aggressive, Charlie trying her best to explain why she \*obviously\* can’t come into work because she’s looking for her brother, and her obnoxious boss telling her how she needs to come in or she’ll be fired. She lets out a mix of a yell and a groan and sets her phone face down on the table. Why did she ever think this would have been a good idea? She can’t help but think about how stupid she was. She punches the pillows on her couch a few times before collapsing on top of them and laying like an immobile starfish. Sometimes she wishes she could just sink into the fabric and become a weird pillow monster who doesn’t worry about the world. Who doesn’t worry about… Jesus, she’s thinking about it again! “UGHH! GOD!” She puches the couch a few more times. 

  


Freedom. That’s what he felt when the realized the chains binding his arms were now loose enough for him to wiggle out, maybe from them not changing the way he’s been tied for almost a year. He slithers out of them and slowly stands up, his eyes locking on a pair of scissors that lie on a table covered in other sharp objects also used to make his life miserable. He picks them up, they feel good in his hands, the cold metal providing him an odd comfort. He slowly stalks out of the basement to find himself in a messy house, he never really thought about what the basement would be connected to but it makes sense it’s a house. He sees a person standing in the kitchen.. his torturer. He quietly steps behind them before forcibly turning them and driving the scissors right into their chest. They fall to the floor and he straddles them and starts to stab them in the stomach over and over. He can barely even comprehend the feeling of relief this brings to him, all the anger building up finally escaping him in this one moment like a deflating balloon. He doesn’t even mind the blood splattering across his hands, though it doesn’t really matter as it’s just joining the blood that was his. He keeps going even when it’s obvious the person is dead, finally stopping when he gets too worn out to continue. He gets to his feet and stumbles out of the house. 

It’s pitch black as he tries his best to get to his apartment, he somehow does without getting caught and he knocks loudly on the door, some blood comes off his hand and stains the door. “Ch.. Charlie..?” He calls out, his voice slightly weak. The door flings open and there stands a shocked Charlie, she looks way more depressed than when he last saw her but he shouldn’t focus on that right now. “Oskar? What.. what the fuck..?” “Can.. I come in..?” She nods quickly. “Y.. yeah.. I-I don’t understand, how did you-“ He pushes past her and enters the apartment. “I need to take you to the hospita-“ “No.” “What? You’re bleeding!” “Just.. just help me yourself.. \*please, Charlie\*…” “.. okay..” He falls onto the couch and Charlie looks at him with a both flabbergasted and worried expression. “Go take a shower first and I’ll um.. get a first aid kit.” “Okay..” He stands up and heads to the bathroom, pausing to look at himself in the mirror. He looks terrible. There’s blood and cuts all over him and he’s oddly skinny. His hair has grown out some and he’s got eye bags that resemble bruises… maybe they are bruises. He forces himself to pay attention to the task at hand and take a shower. When it steps into the water it’s one of the top 5 best feelings he’s ever had, maybe even top 3. It feels heavenly, the hot water burning his skin in just the right way. He rubs soap over his arms and torso and the cuts begin to burn. “Shit..” He mutters and bites his lip. 

  


He stays in there until the water isn’t red anymore. He looks at the mirror again, he looks slightly better now that he’s clean. That’s a good start.

He roughly dries his hair and leans his head out of the door. “Charlie! Are you still here?” Silence. He decides to just wrap the towel around his body and exit the bathroom. The whole apartment is silent, maybe she left..? He can’t imagine why. He opens the drawer he put his clothes in when they first moved in, hey! They’re still there! He gets a stupid smile on his face and grabs some to change into. After a whole he gets as okay looking as he can, he still has open cuts and dark bruises but he doesn’t look as bad as he did when he got here. He hears the front door open and Charlie call out. “Oskar! I’m back!” He exits the bathroom and sees her holding a grocery bag. “I got some bandages and um.. disinfectant and stuff.” He takes a step forward. “Thank you, Charlie..” “Of course, Oskar.” 

  


She spends a few hours helping him clean his wounds and bandage his cuts. She even only almost threw up once when she saw part his bone was sticking out of his arm, though he \*did\* throw up when he saw it. Finally he’s fully patched up. “Thank you so much, man.. um.. I’m sorry about.. this..” “What? What are sorry about? This is.. great. You’re out! You’re safe!” He smiles with a hint of discomfort. “.. okay.. um.. I’m pretty tired, is it okay if I sleep on the couch..?” “Yes, it’s your house too, remember?” “.. yeah.. but..” He sits down on the couch again. “.. I don’t know.. um.. just.. goodnight.” He nods awkwardly. “.. goodnight.” She gives her best reassuring smile and heads back to her room. She’ll ask him questions tomorrow, today she’ll leave him be. 

  


Oskar has the best sleep he’s had in forever, the couch is soft and the house is warm, he didn’t even have any weird dreams this time! He wakes up in the late afternoon to the smell of pancakes. He stands up and enters the kitchen. “Are you cookin’..?” He yawns. Charlie smiles and looks at him. “Yeah.. it’s uh, been a while since I cooked anything, thought it’d be good to do it for you.” “Well, it smells amazing.” He stuffs his hands in his pockets. “Hey, um.. what happened?” He tenses. “What?” “What happened? How’d you get back?” “I.. um..” He gulps and shits uncomfortably. “.. I just got out.” “But how did yo-“ “I just got out.” He responds roughly. “That’s all.” She looks down and tears up. “Wait, Charlie, I’m sorry.” “.. no, no.. it’s not..” She sniffles. “.. this is just a lot.. it’s all been a lot..” “.. I get it.. I’m sorry.. I shouldn’t have.. um..” He slowly backs out of the kitchen, guilt building up in his stomach way too fast, he’s making her feel bad.. he sits back on the couch and locks his eyes on the ground. 

After 20 minutes or so Charlie hands him a plate with two pancakes on it. “Here.” She sits next to him. “.. thanks.. I haven’t eaten anything real in forever.” He immediately starts to eat, finishing both of them quickly. “Woah, woah, slow down.” “Sorry, haha.. um..” He looks at her. “Hey, don’t you have work?” “It’s Saturday.” “… oh.” He clears his throat. “Hey, um, would you mind if I cut my hair?” She blinks. “Cut your hair? Now?” “Uh.. yeah.” She thinks before eventually nodding. “Yeah, alright.” 

  


He’s staring at himself in the mirror while cutting his hair, he starts to feel paranoid, it’s like the him in the mirror is watching him. He takes a step back and sets the scissors on the counter. He killed someone. It hasn’t set in until now. He \*really\* killed somebody. He throws up into the sink, when he stops he notices his nose is bleeding. “Fuck.. I’m so..” His eyes blur with tears as he washes his face, and he can’t stop the tears when they begin to run down his cheeks as he starts to hyperventilate. He tries to calm himself by focusing on the task of cleaning up the sink but it does little to make him feel better. He feels like he’s going to pass out. He leans against the sink and tries to calm down. He starts to hear static, it gets louder and louder until his ears start to bleed. He yells something but he can’t hear it over the ear piercing noise. He falls backwards against the wall and tries to steady himself but it’s hard when he’s also coughing up blood onto the floor. It all builds up until he passes out and falls face-first into the sink. 

  


He’s sprinting through the forest, running away from… something. Every so often he feels the metal of a blade almost slice his back, but it doesn’t. His lungs throb but his head’s even worse, it feels like there’s something slicing right through it. But he can’t focus on the pain, he has to focus on surviving. He doesn’t even know how he got here but he knows it’s life or death, and he’s not ready to die yet. His foot gets caught on a branch and it sends him flying into the dirt ground beneath him. “Hah… c-caught you..” The man chasing him remarks. Oskar tries his best to crawl forward but a foot presses against his back and knocks him flat on his stomach. “.. please..” He begs softly and scratches his nails against the dirt. 

He quickly sits up and puts a hand on his chest. Just a dream..? His head throbs in a way reminiscent to when he… he doesn’t want to think about out it. He lifts his hands to feel that there’s bandages wrapped around his head. What.. happened? He can’t remember. He leans back against the couch cushion and closes his eyes. 

  


He opens his eyes to see that he’s still on the couch but he’s drawing again, it’s a weird, tall skinny thing and the face isn’t done yet. Looking at it kind of makes him uncomfortable, so he closes the notebook and sets it next to him. “Charlie..?” Oskar calls out and looks around. The house is empty.. for some reason that fact fills him with fear and paranoia. He stands up and immediately almost passes out. “.. Charlie..” He calls out once more and covers his face in his hands. “… where are you..?” He drops his hands and moves to the door, groggily pushing it open and falling against the wall opposite from it. He shakes his head to try and clear it. He moves down the hallway and down the stairs, eventually managing to exit the complex without passing out. “.. Charlie.. where are you..?” He hears a voice coming from the woods. “Oskar!” It’s Charlie. He tenses, he hates the woods, he’s scared of it.. “Oskar, help!” Despite his better judgment he chases after the voice, running until he collapses. 

  


When he wakes he sees a creature in front of him, it’s completely indescribable but it brings him terror he can’t comprehend. He scrambles to his feet and starts to walk back while keeping his eyes on it but it comes towards him, he feels helpless until he realizes there’s scissors in his pocket.. he doesn’t remember putting them there but he ignores that and charges at the thing in front of him, knocking it to the ground and stabbing it in where he thinks it’s chest is. Over and over as it hisses and lets out ear-piercing yells. Static builds up in his ears and blood pours through his nose. He closes his eyes tightly until he hears another scream.. a human scream.. Charlie’s scream. He opens his eyes to find him not over a monster.. but over his sister. “Charlie! I.. I don’t understand..” He starts to cry, tears dripping down his face and onto hers. “.. what.. happened..?” She opens her mouth to say something but all that comes out is a pained whimper. “Please.. Charlie.. please, stay awake.. you can’t.. I..” He moves to hug her close to his body, quiet sobs filling the air. “Please.. you can’t die.. you can’t..” She goes limp against him and he pulls back. “.. Charlie.?” 

  


Oskar lays next to the body of his sister, he propped her up against a tree to sit next to him, their hands together and his head against her shoulder, and scissors impaled into his stomach.. at least they’ll be together soon.. right..? He can’t help but weakly smile, they’ll finally have the happy life they wanted.. everything is fine. Suddenly the rough sound of static fills his ears, getting louder and louder until his ears bleed. “You’re not done yet.” A voice calls to him. “.. leave.. me..” He tries his best to answer but he’s too weak to get out much more.. he’ll try his best to make this the end.. but it won’t be. ",1,1759269527.0,creepypasta,1,1.0,False
1nuqk7c,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nuqk7c/which_espresso_machine_works_well_for_apartments/,Which espresso machine works well for apartments?,"Hey everyone! I wanted to share my experience with finding the perfect espresso machine for apartment living since I know a lot of us are dealing with limited counter space but still want that perfect morning brew.

After months of research and trying different options, I've discovered some great choices that won't take up your entire kitchen or break the bank. Trust me, I've been through the struggle of trying to fit bulky appliances in my tiny kitchen!

First off, let's talk about what really matters when choosing an espresso machine for an apartment:
- Counter space (obviously!)
- Noise level (your neighbors will thank you)
- Steam power
- Ease of cleaning
- Price point

I recently found this amazing compact espresso maker that checks all these boxes: https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine. It's seriously been a game-changer for my morning routine. The footprint is surprisingly small, and it doesn't sound like a jet engine taking off when I use it at 6 AM.

Here's what I've learned about apartment-friendly espresso machines:

1. Size matters
Look for machines under 12 inches wide. Anything bigger will eat up valuable counter space you need for other stuff.

2. Pressure matters
You want at least 9 bars of pressure for proper extraction. Don't fall for those cheaper machines that can't deliver the goods.

3. Steam wand quality
If you're into lattes and cappuccinos, make sure the steam wand is powerful enough. Some compact machines skimp on this feature.

4. Water reservoir size
This is tricky - you want it big enough that you're not constantly refilling, but not so big it takes up too much space.

I've been using this machine (https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine) for about six months now, and it hits all these points perfectly. Plus, the cleanup is super easy - crucial when you're dealing with apartment living and tiny sinks.

Pro tip: Whatever machine you choose, get a good grinder too. Pre-ground coffee just doesn't cut it for espresso, and it'll make even the best machine produce mediocre shots.

Some other considerations for apartment dwellers:
- Look for machines with built-in tampers to save space
- Consider whether you need a cup warmer on top
- Think about maintenance requirements
- Check the warranty (super important in small spaces where repairs can be tricky)

The best part about modern compact espresso machines is that you don't have to sacrifice quality for size anymore. Technology has come a long way, and even smaller machines can pull shots that rival what you'd get at your local coffee shop.

I know it can be overwhelming with all the options out there, but hopefully this helps narrow things down for fellow apartment dwellers looking to up their coffee game! Let me know if you have any questions - I'm always happy to chat about coffee!",1,1759269475.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

I also had this idea before & had made a group but did not know where to share it to!


 I’m working on ExtroIntrovert SG – Coffee, Chats & Chill. The goal is simple: meet genuine people in Singapore for low-pressure hangouts — coffee, board games, walks, movies, etc.

I’ve tried meeting people online and offline for years — apps bring bots or ghosters, people in SG are often too reserved to trust strangers, and even through Meetup I’ve had good talks but no real follow-ups. I’ve also tried starting a business or IG page and barely got any support. It sometimes feels like all the effort is pointless because there’s no support network.

I’m putting this out here in hopes that someone else is also looking for meaningful connections in SG. If you’re interested or have feedback, drop a comment or DM me. Would love to hear if you’d join or ideas you have.",1,1759269334.0,ChillSG,0,1.0,False

The Caltrain power outlets are only capable of 200W (1.67A), so you need a pretty low wattage way to heat water.

[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLKNRTZ4](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLKNRTZ4) is one of the very few immersion heaters that would work on Caltrain. Note that it will take a long time to boil water with a 200W immersion heater, probably 15 minutes just for 8 ounces, but you don't want to trip the circuit breaker with a higher current heater. As one of the reviewers noted, the specs listed are wrong, since the power draw at 120V would be 1/4 the power draw at 240V, and indeed in his test it was 200W at 120V and 825W at 240V.

Unless you get a seat with a table, it would be unwieldy to do single cup pour-over with a coffee cone, but for tea, or instant coffee, it would be okay.

Here's every mistake I made so you,"Tomorrow morning (October 1st), I'm opening the codebase I haven't touched since April.

Before I do, I need to get this out. Not for sympathy. For anyone reading this who's on the same path.

**Quick self-check. Are you doing 3+ of these RIGHT NOW?**

→ Saying ""just one more week"" but it's been 3 months  
→ Feeling guilty when you're NOT working  
→ Defending your lack of boundaries as ""hustle""  
→ Getting defensive at ANY user feedback  
→ Dreading opening your laptop

If you checked 3+, stop reading and go outside for 10 minutes. I'm serious. That's exactly how mine started.

# THE STORY (Short Version)

18 months ago: Started building a backtesting tool for traders

12 months later:

* ✅ 900 signups
* ✅ $130/month revenue
* ❌ Complete burnout
* ❌ Hated my own product

**April 2025:** Quit. Just closed the laptop and walked away.

What I sacrificed to get there:

* Going outside (sun was ""wasting time"")
* My electric guitar (had it since I was 15, didn't touch it for months)
* Tennis, gym, all sports
* Friends (""too busy"")

I told myself this was hustle. It was self-destruction.

# THE EXACT MOMENT I FUCKED UP

Let me show you where I should have stopped but didn't.

**Week 47 of building:**

**User feedback:** *""I spent 10 minutes trying to find the start button. Gave up.""*

**What I did:**

1. Took it personally (""They're just stupid, it's obvious"")
2. Spent 3 weeks rebuilding the entire UI in isolation
3. Made it ""perfect"" with animations and tooltips
4. Never contacted that user again
5. Launched new version
6. **Still confusing**

**What I should have done:**

1. Jumped on a 15-minute call: ""Show me where you got stuck""
2. Fixed THAT specific thing
3. Followed up: ""Better now?""
4. Iterated based on response

**Time wasted:** 3 weeks  
**Time actually needed:** 3 hours

See the difference? I optimized for perfect. Should have optimized for understanding.

**→ Are you doing this right now?** Building features in isolation instead of talking to the person who complained?

# HOW BURNOUT HAPPENS (The Timeline)

You don't go from healthy to burned out overnight. Here's my progression:

**Weeks 1-10:** Excited, working late by choice  
**Weeks 11-20:** ""Just need to finish this sprint""  
**Weeks 21-30:** Feeling guilty on rest days  
**Weeks 31-40:** Defending my hours to concerned friends  
**Weeks 41-50:** Dreading opening laptop  
**Weeks 51-52:** Hating what I built

It's gradual. Like boiling a frog.

**→ Where are you in this timeline right now?**

# OLD ME VS NEW ME: THE FRAMEWORK

Here's how my decision-making changed. Copy this:

**📧 SITUATION: Got harsh user feedback**

**Old me:** ""They don't understand my vision"" → Work 16 hours to prove them wrong  
**New me:** ""They're giving me free user research"" → Schedule call immediately

**⏰ SITUATION: Feature taking longer than expected**

**Old me:** ""I'll work through the weekend to finish""  
**New me:** ""Ship what's done Friday, iterate Monday based on usage""

**😴 SITUATION: Feeling exhausted**

**Old me:** ""More coffee, push through, sleep is for the weak""  
**New me:** ""Red flag – something is systematically wrong""

**👥 SITUATION: Friend asks to hang out**

**Old me:** ""Can't, I'm busy"" (said this for 12 months straight)  
**New me:** ""Yes, I need this"" (humans need humans)

Notice the pattern? Old me optimized for output at any cost. New me optimizes for sustainable progress.

**→ Which version are you being right now?**

# THE BREAK (April - September 2025)

I quit in April. Didn't touch the code for 6 months.

**What I did instead:**

* Got outside every single day (vitamin D is not optional)
* Started playing guitar again (creative outlet with ZERO pressure to be ""productive"")
* Tennis 3x per week, gym, running (rebuilt my destroyed body)
* Talked to other founders (learned everyone has a version of this story)

I felt human again.

**But here's what kept me up at night:**

Even while I was gone, people kept signing up. **1-3 new trial accounts. Every. Single. Day.**

They wanted this. I just didn't know how to build it without destroying myself.

# MY EXACT BOUNDARIES (Steal These)

I met a pro trader through a friend. We're partnering up to try again.

But this time I have rules I cannot negotiate with:

**🔴 HARD STOPS (Non-Negotiable)**

* Work ends 6pm sharp (laptop closes, no ""just 5 more minutes"")
* Absolutely zero work on Saturdays (full recovery day)
* Morning routine = exercise BEFORE opening laptop
* No coding during meals (food and screens don't mix)

**🟡 WARNING SIGNS (If These Happen, Re-Evaluate)**

* Skip exercise 2 days in a row → something is wrong
* Work past 7pm twice in one week → I'm slipping into old patterns
* Dread opening laptop → force 1 full day off immediately
* Friends say ""you okay?"" more than once → actually listen

**🟢 SUCCESS METRICS (Weekly Audit)**

Every Sunday I ask:

* Did I go outside every day this week? (yes/no)
* Did I play music at least 2x? (yes/no)
* Did I do tennis/sport 3x? (yes/no)
* Do I still enjoy this project? (yes/no)

**If I hit 3+ no's in any week, I'm doing it wrong.**

Not vague ""work-life balance."" Concrete rules I can actually measure.

**→ What are YOUR boundaries? Do you even have any?**

If not, pick ONE from my list above and start this week. Right now. Before you keep reading.

# THE NEW STRATEGY (Complete 180)

Here's what we're trying – it's unconventional:

**FREE Discord community where:**

* My partner (pro trader) shares daily market insights
* Members get free tool access (normally $19/month)
* Weekly live strategy breakdown calls
* We build trust for 6-8 weeks
* **THEN** we offer a paid course ($997) only to engaged members who've seen results

**Why give away the tool for free?**

Because last time I charged upfront and delivered minimal value. That was backwards.

This time: Deliver massive value first. Build genuine trust. Then let the right people *choose* to pay for more.

**The bet:** Community > Code. Relationships > Features.

We'll see if I'm right.

# TOMORROW (October 1st) – THE SPECIFIC PLAN

Here's exactly what I'm doing:

**9:00 AM** – Open the codebase (haven't seen it since April)  
**9:00-11:00 AM** – Just understand what's there, what's broken  
**11:00-12:00 PM** – Pick ONE small thing I can ship by Friday  
**12:00-1:00 PM** – Lunch break away from computer  
**1:00-6:00 PM** – Work on that one small thing  
**6:00 PM** – Laptop closes (hard stop)

**What I will NOT do:**

* ❌ Try to ""fix everything"" before shipping
* ❌ Make it ""perfect""
* ❌ Work ""just a little longer""

**What I WILL do:**

* ✅ Ship something small by Friday
* ✅ Stick to 6-hour work days
* ✅ Document what actually happens
* ✅ Talk to users immediately

I'm terrified. Scared I'll open the code and want to fix everything. Scared I'll fall back into 14-hour days. Scared I'll lose myself again.

But I have things I didn't have last time:

* A partner (not doing this alone)
* Clear written boundaries (listed above)
* Public accountability (you're watching)
* 900 people who already signed up (they want this)

# WHY I'M SHARING THIS PUBLICLY

Last time I worked in complete silence:

* No one saw me spiraling
* No one could tell me ""stop perfecting, just ship it""
* No one to share the emotional burden
* Just me versus my perfectionism

**This time:**

* Daily Twitter updates (real-time)
* Weekly LinkedIn posts (reflections)
* Monthly Reddit check-ins (full transparency)
* Real metrics, real struggles, real wins AND failures

Not because I have it all figured out.

**Because I absolutely don't.**

This is accountability. This is burnout prevention. This is how I make sure I don't quit again.

# YOUR TURN – LET'S DO THIS TOGETHER

Okay. If you made it this far, here's what I actually need from you.

**Answer these honestly (to yourself, or reply below):**

1. When's the last time you went outside for non-work reasons?
2. When did you last do something creative just for fun?
3. Do you feel guilty when you're not working?
4. Are you defending your long hours to people who care about you?

**If your answers scare you, let's make a pact right now:**

**→ Reply with ONE boundary you'll set this week. Just one.**

Real examples:

* *""No work after 7pm starting today""*
* *""Going outside for 20 minutes every single day""*
* *""Calling my friend I've been avoiding this Saturday""*
* *""Playing guitar/tennis/whatever every Sunday morning""*

**I will reply to every single one with accountability.**

Not kidding. Every single one. And next Monday (Oct 7th) I'll check back in on this thread.

**We're not doing this alone anymore.**

# CURRENT STATUS

**Right now:**

* 900 signups sitting there from before
* $130 MRR (hasn't changed in 6 months)
* Partner on board (experienced profitable trader)
* Discord community structure ready to launch
* Codebase: Opening tomorrow morning for the first time since April

**Goal:** $10,000 MRR in 12 months. **Without burning out.**

**Today is September 30th, 2025.**

**Tomorrow is October 1st.**

Last time I worked alone in the dark, drowning in perfectionism.

This time, you're here watching.

Tomorrow morning, let's see what's actually in that code.

I see dog owners walking their dogs past my house all day long so why are poops not getting cleaned up? I’m starting to develop a bias against DC dog owners which is crazy because I love pets but I’m seeing a level of entitlement that is so next level I just can’t. 

Like the lady who lets her dog put their paws on the counter of the local coffee shop after being asked not to, and the 3 separate “free range” dog walkers who let their dogs run free without a leash because their dogs are just so “nice”…I bet they are the poopers come to think of it.

Strap in - it’s a long one!

—

I joined the company five years ago. I was hired by someone I’d worked with in my previous role (they were my previous line manager). At the time the owner was investing millions in expanding the company. I was welcomed in and the company needed my specialism. In my previous role I’d built and led a team of 10 doing something they’d never done before, and I was hired to basically do the same thing.

In the first two years I built a whole new department, including scoping and hiring the team, building physical infrastructure (with my own hands). I doubled the KPIs, created new revenue streams and took the area from a cost centre to a profit centre. Within a couple of years it accounted for 10% of total revenue (from maybe 1% before I started). 

But then my boss left. The next one was great and we did more good work together. But he signed off with stress because his boss (the big boss, adjacent to the CEO) behaved in a toxic way to him. 

For a while I then reported directly to the CEO. In that time I was asked to take on additional line management duties of a related team, albeit in an acting capacity.

My team and I had been promised growth and investment but in all the changes it kept getting delayed and eventually they all got fed up with the lack of progress and left, one by one. I was able to replace them after a fashion, but I had to compromise on the skill sets in the team in order to save a couple of colleagues from redundancy.

Then the CEO was pushed out, and then it all started to go bad.

After the CEO left, the aforementioned big boss asked me to report directly to him, saying, “but you don’t need much management do you? You basically manage yourself.”

He then proceeded to virtually ignore me, at least about anything meaningful. I mean, he was civil and would speak to me. Sometimes we’d meet to discuss things, but he’d always manage to avoid really engaging with my area. He’d give lots of nice sounding promises but fail to keep them. He’d say he wanted to be involved in the thing we do (it’s the kind of thing that involves getting people from across the business involved) but then mostly be unavailable. On one occasion he invited me to meet him at his favourite fancy hotel for coffee (where he took his favourites) to discuss my plans for the future. I pitched him a bunch of things and he basically promised me a directorship. Which never transpired.

Meanwhile another member of staff basically stole one of the subdivisions I’d been acting manager of, apparently with the big bosses blessing, and proceeded to run it himself. He’s aided and abetted by another colleague who I’ll call Bob.

The job-thief earned himself a really terrible reputation among the team and eventually exited, which was moderately vindicating! Bob leaves and goes to work somewhere else.

Then i get a call from a colleague with “great news”: we’re getting a new person in from their (much bigger, much more reputable) old workplace. This person would join on a temp contract to act in a senior role to tie lots of departments together and, importantly, “help” with the area I look after. It was the first I’d heard about my department needing help.

Notably my boss didn’t tell me. I had to call him to talk about it. He just repeated the same thing about “help” and assured me it wouldn’t affect my job.

The day before they arrive I get a message from HR asking if I’ll be reporting to this person. It’s the first I hear of it, and I presume not, but the big boss remains silent and when I eventually speak to him indicates that we should sort it out between us.

This person arrives and proceeds to be the biggest black hole of emotion you’ve ever met. I really tried to be friendly but they completely sucked it up and gave nothing back. Then they started making a bunch of decisions about my area, directing my team, representing it in meetings and taking ownership. They commission new work, change the structure and generally take over.

At this point I start to blank. With no other guidance on what to do, no incentive and no structure, I basically zone out. I spend six months sitting at my desk not knowing what I’m supposed to be doing. 

At the end of their contract I offer to take this person out to lunch with the team to say bye. They say no, then a few days later they leave.

A while later the big boss announces he’ll be leaving at the end of the year. His acting replacement is great and there’s a brief window of reprieve before the MD (no CEO anymore) announces a new big boss to replace him. 

Same MD then informs us the owner has decided we all need to be in the office four days a week, after years of hybrid working. This causes havoc for my home life and my wife leaves her own job - partly because she’s been so miserable there herself, but also because it’s untenable to do with me out four days a week.

The new guy comes in and on his first day an old face turns up randomly in a meeting. It’s Bob (remember him?). I ask him what he’s doing here and he says he’s the new deputy big boss. The new big boss eventually confirms this a few hours later when he addresses the team. It’s the first any of us hear about it.

As he beds in the new big boss tells me he really sees the value of my area - “it’s the big opportunity for the business to grow”. He asks us to double our output, which we do by changing the way we work and the type of thing we make.

Then, while I’m on holiday I get an email from the big boss: he’s hired a new person to be the next rung up from me, to act across a bunch of departments. This new person will be my boss. 

I tell him I’m disappointed - I’d have hoped at this point that if there was an opening I might have been considered for it… or at least told it was open. But he says it requires someone with XYZ skills I don’t have, or want to do (which is a massive assumption on his part because he never asked).

So the new person starts, and it turns out it’s one of Bob’s good friends (not the original job thief, another one). This person is relatively well-known and has done good work at his previous place so initially I’m cautiously optimistic. We have an initial chat and it seems fine.

But now (yes we’re finally caught up), he’s starting to micromanage me. First he says he has a new way of doing one of our processes. Then he literally takes over during another process, in front of Bob and the big boss. Then he pulls me aside because of a tiny error and gives me a patronising “don’t let it happen again”. Now he’s asked to review all my team’s work personally. 

And I am so angry, and depressed, and disillusioned that I don’t know what to do. 

I’ve been interviewing for jobs for over two years and despite having a greatCV and interviewing well - getting to final round on several big jobs - I’ve not had a single offer.

The thing that gives me most hope is the side hustle I’ve launched as a way of engineering my own parachute off this plane, but I’m doing that evenings and weekends and I’m knackered! I don’t mind because I’m really enjoying it, it’s just not quite ready to cushion my landing if I take the leap and quit my job.

If you’ve got this far, then you are already incredible for bearing with my long story. 

So: what should I do?

What do you think of this? Does it resonate? Am I alone? Have you been in a situation like this? How did you get out of it?

Thanks.

When we got out of work at the same time often we would just stand outside for hours just talking about life. He told me about his life problems and i told him about mine. He gave me small compliments here and there too.

Recently a girl texted me telling me she was his gf of 2 years. He had never mentioned this to me.

When Jeep launched the Gladiator, it wasn’t just another pickup—it was a statement. It’s a truck built for people who drive past the pavement and into the unknown. But while the Gladiator is rugged and capable, finding a topper that truly fits its unique shape and use case? That’s been a challenge—until now.

Enter the FLATED® Air-Topper® CAP, the world’s first inflatable truck topper built specifically for the Jeep Gladiator. It delivers the strength of a hard shell without the weight or hassle. Whether you’re gearing up for overlanding, road trips, winter commuting, or weekend camping, this topper turns your Gladiator into a fully protected, adventure-ready rig.

# Why Gladiator Owners Need a Purpose-Built Topper

Let’s be real — Jeep didn’t build the Gladiator to be just another mid-size pickup. This is Jeep’s first real truck since the Comanche, and people didn’t buy it because they wanted a crossover. Installing something heavy and permanent like a traditional shell isn’t your only option. The Gladiator is for people who bought it because they wanted a truck bed they could actually use. Sometimes that means loading gear, hauling toys, or camping under the stars. Other times it means keeping your stuff dry on the way to work. But one thing is certain:

Generic sizing doesn’t work for a unique truck. Wide gaps, rattling, or water leaks happen.

The Air-Topper® CAP fixes all of that. It’s shaped specifically for the Gladiator, aligns with cab height for a clean, aerodynamic look, and installs in minutes—all without tools or drilling.

# What Makes the Air-Topper® CAP Different?

This isn’t just another camper shell. It’s patent-protected inflatable tech built from drop-stitch material, the same durable fabric used in whitewater rafts and premium SUP boards.

# Key Features Jeep Owners Love

✅ Cab-Height Design – Keeps airflow smooth and fuel efficiency intact  
✅ Lightweight & One-Person Install – No clamps, no frustration  
✅ Inflates in Minutes – Just unroll, pump, strap, and go  
✅ Weatherproof & Rugged – Handles rain, snow, dust, and wind with ease  
✅ Deflates and Stores Anywhere – Fits in a closet, garage corner, or back seat

# Hard-Shell Strength Without the Bulk

A traditional fiberglass topper weighs 150–200 lbs. That’s like bolting a refrigerator to your truck bed. Once it’s on, it’s staying there.

The Air-Topper® CAP uses a 4 inch drop-stitch panels that you can actually put weight on. Want to haul your ladder, or kayak or paddleboard? The AirTopper can handle up to 250 lbs easy on the roof and safe at highway speeds. The AirTopper

* Feel rigid when inflated — like a hard shell at full pressure  
* Weigh a fraction when deflated — easy to move, carry, or store  
* Handle real-world abuse — proven in marine and military applications  

You get durability without sacrificing flexibility.

# Install It in Minutes — No Tools Required

1. Unroll it in your Gladiator bed  
2. Attach the included pump  
3. Inflate & strap it down  

Done. You’ve got weatherproof coverage faster than brewing coffee. Need your open bed back? Deflate, roll it up, and stash it until your next adventure.

# Built for Every Season & Every Trip

# 🛣 Road Trips

* Keeps your gear dry and dust-free  
* More aerodynamic than bulky caps  
* Pair with FLATED® Air-Deck or Air-Storage for full bed camping setups  

# 🏜 Off-Road & Overlanding

* Seals out mud, sand, and snow  
* Light enough to avoid sagging suspension  
* Works great with rooftop tents and bed racks  

# ❄ Winter Weather

* Stops snow and slush buildup  
* Protects tools, groceries, and daily gear  
* Install in fall, remove in spring—no permanent hardware required

# Easy to Store When You Don’t Need It

Traditional toppers require ceiling hoists or full garage space. The Air-Topper® CAP?

* Deflates and rolls up  
* Fits on a shelf or in a tote  
* Even comes on long trips deflated so you can deploy it mid-adventure  

That’s true versatility.

# Why Jeep Gladiator Owners Are Switching to FLATED®

✔ Only topper made specifically for the Gladiator  
✔ Matches the truck’s adventurous spirit  
✔ Fast install, easy removal, zero commitment  
✔ Backed by real patents—not knockoffs

# FAQ: Air-Topper® CAP for Jeep Gladiator

# Is it safe for highway driving?

Yes. Once strapped and inflated, it handles highway speeds like a traditional topper.

# Can I leave it on year-round?

Absolutely. It’s built for winter slush, summer road trips, and everything in between.

# How much does it weigh compared to fiberglass?

A fraction. Light enough for one person to lift and carry.

# Does it fit other trucks?

FLATED® makes Air-Toppers for many trucks, but this model is precision-fit for the Jeep Gladiator.

**Final Verdict**

If you love the flexibility of an open bed but want instant protection when needed, the FLATED® Air-Topper® CAP is the perfect upgrade for your Jeep Gladiator.

**Johan Edgar, American NSA Director** 

*May 29th, 2148*

My hotel room’s air conditioner whirred with dedication as my cursor hovered between the four empire dossiers. After the SETI director’s impromptu biology lecture, it was a relief to be back in the realm of politics—at least until it sank in that I had to summarize and perform threat assessments on four empires each more important than every nation on Earth combined. Suddenly, the room felt a little bit too cold even for my carbon ass.

Putting on the hotel bathrobe for illogical comfort of extra coverage, I carefully navigated my wireless mouse over to the file labeled ‘Gifrid Empire’ and double clicked to open it. The opening paragraph contained an image of a Gifrid along with a brief biological overview. Most of it I already knew from Lenfield, but there was one last detail that stuck out at me. *‘Like most sapient species (all but the Yovi as of this contact package), Gifrid are asexual lifeforms.’* Fortunately, I had paid the bare minimum attention in high school science classes required to know what that meant: no boys, no girls—just splitting and sprouting like bacteria. Adding that to the President’s document under ‘diplomatic considerations’, I continued to read through.

After the introductory paragraph came an explanation of Gifrid governance. Apparently, their planets were ruled by various ‘colony lords’ who owned large swathes of land and carried out the will of their ‘grand executive’. Once elected, grand executive ruled for life in a sort of constitutional dictatorship. Colony lords had power to legislate within their territory so long as it didn’t contradict the top dog. They formed planetary councils that could petition their leader, and in theory the grand executive could be deposed if enough councils received mandates from their people to do the job. Leaning back on my chair, I stared at the neat little chart of Gifrid governance. On paper, it looked downright civilized—elections, checks and balances, the works. Reading between the lines, though, I saw a monarchy with extra paperwork attached. 

What surprised me most about this government wasn’t that it was dictatorial—we had plenty of wannabe strongmen on Earth who played the same game. The real shocker was just how damn *stable* it was. Supposedly, the system was established before Christ was born, and here they were still going strong. No bloody revolts, no constant regime changes, no election turnovers—just leaders with centuries of experience and all the power they needed. That whole ‘deposing the grand executive’ thing? Initially, I’d assumed it was only possible on paper—the kind of empty promise you give to citizens to make them think they’re in control. Turns out I was wrong. A thousand years ago, their reigning grand executive started overtaxing and underperforming, so the councils told them to take a hike. When the bastard refused, they were dragged off to prison and all their assets seized. Then, the Gifrid voted in the next guy and everything went back to normal. 

Switching over to the document for President Stine, I typed: *‘Gifrid governance: stable constitutional dictatorship—functionally a monarchy. Checks and balances not for show.’*

Sliding down from the conclusion to their government section, my eyes immediately latched onto the ‘military’ header directly beneath it. 

The Gifrid weren’t exactly chatty about numbers—no fleet counts, no firepower specs, nothing concrete that could be used against them. One line, though, stood out to me immediately. Apparently, over ninety percent of their ships were drones: not crewed frigates or carriers stacked with wide-eyed recruits—drones. Disposable, obedient, and apparently able to be made in the thousands on an assembly line. They preferred to strike fast, strike hard, and put as few of their own in the line of fire as possible. This doctrine continued on the ground, where Gifrid were stated to employ ‘state of the art synthetic soldiers’. The numbers were scarce at best, but still this section taught me plenty about their doctrine. *‘Gifrid use mostly machines for warfare. They avoid fielding soldiers.’*

It wasn’t until I came to the section marked ‘demographics’ that I learned why that was. When I first saw the population estimate of over twenty billion, the part of my brain that was still a lizard waiting to bathe on a sun rock recoiled at the sheer implied number of aliens. That feeling, however, lasted for about three seconds before I realized just how much *smaller* that was than I’d been expecting. Sure, they outnumbered us two-to-one, but given their resources, you’d think the number would be much higher. Taking a look back at their biology section, I eventually figured out the reason for this disparity—Gifrid only produce one or two offspring every one hundred years. This, too, was going in the docket. *‘Slow reproduction. Population: 20 billion’*

Alien as they undoubtedly were, the Gifrid were a species I had at least had the honor of speaking to. Maneuvering back to the package menu and selecting the file labeled ‘Funac Parliament’, I was already leaving behind even the vaguest familiarity and plunging myself headfirst into the unknown to bob for information.

Upon first glance, the Funac reminded me of a mixture between a gorilla and a mythological rock golem. Their ‘skin’ was like smooth grey stone, with small crystal protrusions near the shoulders. Like the Gifrid, they were big—nine to ten feet tall when on two legs, though they usually walked around on all fours. They weren’t as long-lived as the Gifrid, with lifespans of about six hundred years (still absolutely flooring compared to a human, but not quite as mind-bending). As for listed temperature range; they were stated here to thrive best between four hundred and five hundred degrees Celsius—apparently these ridiculous temps were ‘normal’ not just for the Gifrid, but for just about all the life in the galaxy.

Leafing through their government section, I was relieved to see that the ‘parliament’ part of their name wasn’t ornamental. The Funac operated off of a democratic system complete with councils, prime ministers, and election cycles. Technically, by our standards, they were closer to a republic than a parliamentary democracy, but I wasn’t about to argue semantics with them. Scrolling further, I saw their election cycles spelled out: thirty years for local leadership, sixty for prime ministers. I damn-near spat out my coffee. *Sixty years?* Our presidents got four years, maybe eight if they were good or we were stupid, before getting tossed out for the next guy who promises cheaper gas and better slogans. With a six century lifespan, sixty years probably feels to them like two terms in congress. But to us? That’s an entire lifetime under one administration. Hell, if FDR had been a Funac, he’d still be in office *today*. *‘Democracy. Long terms, but functional.’*

Looking into their policies, I was for the most part pleasantly surprised—the Funac matched up damn-near perfectly with western democratic values. Not only that, checking the military tab, their fleet was stated to be tied for number one in the galaxy. They were like an idealized version of the former NATO powers in space. This, I had decided, was more than likely going to be the power I recognized Stine push for an alliance with. Then, however, I came upon the ‘religion’ section. At first, I assumed I wouldn’t find anything more than formalities in there: the name of their god or gods, what they considered taboo. The first sentence immediately shattered that idea like glass. ‘Religious teaching and expression is strictly outlawed in Funac space’.

“What?” I murmured in confusion, immediately scrolling down for more. Apparently, the Funac used to be a largely theocratic people when they were still stuck on their homeworld, Distere. There, one major religion arose focused around two networked super volcanoes as sacred. Their largest cities were built around them and pilgrimages were conducted to bathe in their molten springs. In comparison to how unusual silicon life seemed to me at first, this faith sounded almost normal. As it turns out, though, those super volcanoes were due for an eruption. Funac scientists tried to warn people, but their findings were suppressed by theocratic leadership, who insisted that the ‘spirit fountains’ couldn’t possibly harm them. When the findings did get out, religious leadership ordered that anyone who tried to leave the radius lacked faith and was to be excommunicated—a social death sentence by their standards. Turns out, no amount of prayers was going to stop that magma, and the volcanoes went off. Only fifteen percent of the Funac population survived that event. After that, they swore off faith like it was a disease.

I rubbed my eyes, suddenly more tired than I had any right to be given my bloodstream steadily becoming coffee-based. On paper, the Funac looked tantalizingly good. Democracy with centuries-long stability, policies so clean they make out planet look ass-backwards by comparison, all defended by a military on par with anyone in the galaxy. If we were smart, we’d be begging them to take us under their wing. But then there was the fine print. No religion. Not ‘keep it out of schools’. Not ‘don’t mix it with government’. Outlawed. Period. In a lot of ways, I felt bad for them. Their ancestors (apparently this took place eight hundred years ago) had to watch as their worldview killed their own loved ones and then decided that they’d never let it happen again. Rational? Maybe. Extreme? Absolutely. Political suicide if tried on Earth? One hundred percent. Half of our planet would sooner burn than sign off on that kind of deal. Hell, half of that half would probably start the fire. *‘Direct hostility is unlikely but outright alliance would be problematic.’* I wrote.

Next on the list of alien empires was the Yovi Imperium. The first thing that stuck out to me was the ‘imperium’ part of their nation’s name. Images flashed through my mind of the ancient Romans and other similarly authoritarian regimes throughout Human history. “Please don’t be the space Roman Empire with nukes…” I grumbled as though attempting to negotiate with reality itself.

Opening the file, my eyes immediately locked onto the image of a Yovi. They were humanoid: tall and slender with bodies like smooth, angular obsidian. Spikes atop their heads superficially invoked the notion of hair, the protrusions getting shorter as they continued down the creature’s spine and to the tip of their tail just large enough to drag on the floor. Despite the obvious differences, these aliens were much closer to what I’d always imagined in passing from first contact—not lookalikes, but at least analogous enough to us. 

Checking their biology paragraph, the numbers were no more absurd than those of the Funac or Gifrid. Seven hundred and fifty year lifespans made them slightly less long lived than the centipedes currently loitering in our skies, and their temperature tolerances were well in line with what I’d already read from the others. The Yovi were listed as gonochoric—a term I had to look up that meant they could be one of two sexes; male or female barring outliers. Compared to the asexual Gifird, this small biological similarity was almost a comfort. Combine this with their exotic, yet familiar appearance and I could already see *certain groups* of people taking a personal interest in them. *‘Two sexes,’* I wrote. *‘Males and females like humans’*

Reluctantly scrolling past to the government section, it was obvious within the few sentences that the word ‘imperium’ wasn’t for show. The Yovi were run by a council of aristocrats drawn from families of wealth of military influence. From their ranks, one of them was elevated to the status of emperor-for-life, charged with making the most important decisions—when to go to war chief among them. Apparently, Yovi leaders were judged not on policy or popularity, but how many new planets they can stick under their proverbial boot. New territory, new goods, new slaves—these were the currencies of Yovi governance. Unfortunately, this setup wasn’t anything Earth hadn’t seen before—from Rome to Russia, we’ve had no shortage of expansionist oligarchies. Reading through the finer details of their council setup, it was obvious this wasn’t some noble experiment in governance—it was a system built to keep the war hawks fat and happy. *‘Yovi government,’* I wrote. *‘Oligarchy of wealthy/military families. Expansionism hard-wired’.*

Moving on to their military, at first I was happy to see that the Gifrid had gone ahead and included actual ship estimates. My relief, however, quickly gave way to wide-eyed horror as I looked at what those details were. The Yovi had *tens of thousands* of ships, a good portion of which were dreadnoughts with enough munitions to devastate a continent. Mandatory conscription meant that in a matter of months, they could field and deploy more soldiers than there were humans on Earth. Yovi war doctrine wasn’t about surgical strikes like the Gifrid or deterrence like the Funac—they specialized in overwhelming force. Despite this, however, the Yovi did appear to have something resembling rules of war—though they didn’t look anything at all like our own. When invading technologically inferior species (something that they apparently did often enough for it to be noted in their military strategy), the Yovi had a rule against using technology better than their opponents. If the enemy is fighting with spears and bows, then so are the Yovi. This mercy, however, did not extend to battles against those with nuclear weapons or starships—once you can split the atom, they take off the kid gloves. Supposedly, the reason they did this wasn't to be fair to their enemies, but so that their soldiers could always have the honor of saying they fought an equal opponent—even when numbers-wise, the enemy never stood a chance. *‘Biggest fleet in galaxy along with Funac. Can field est. fifteen billion soldiers. Warriors by code.’*

Finally managing to tear my gaze away from the ship counts, I scrolled through information until I hit the section marked ‘culture’. If there was one species that might annihilate us for a social faux pas, it was this one, so figuring out how *not* to piss them off—ideally before our first meeting with them—was going to be important. As one might expect from a species with such expansive fleets, the Yovi were a civilization of warriors. Their equivalents to high school were as much for weapon mastery and tactics as they were for math and science. Contrary to what I’d been expecting, though, their cities were beautiful works of art and civil engineering. The Yovi took almost pride in running their territories as they did in getting them—not that that was any comfort to their slaves. Here’s the real kicker, though: the Yovi were the only other species in the galaxy with concepts of romance. Not only was love something they were *capable* of, it was apparently central to their culture. The heroes of their epics were like if Julius Caesar was written by Shakespeare, embarking on long campaigns of conquest in the name of love. In their most famous poems, star-crossed Yovi burn down their enemies and build dynasties from the ashes. *God help us when the internet gets a hold of this…*

Staring at my screen for a few seconds as I contemplated how to even word the explanation, I sighed and typed out *‘romance-based warrior culture. They value love similarly to humans’*. *Similarly.* At the end of the day, this species was closer to humanity than the Funac or Gifrid could hope to be. Maybe that was the problem. *‘Treat as a threat.’*

Last on the list of major spacefaring empires (which I noted with dismay implied the existence of *minor* spacefaring empires they just weren’t going to tell us about) was the Veyla. The image of them was definitely the least intimidating of the bunch: two-foot-tall gemstones with spider legs that looked like they could be punted away with a steel-toed boot. Hell, they were almost cute. Then I read the part about them living for two thousand years and they stopped seeming so quaint.

Militarily, the Veyla Faithful supposedly had the smallest fleet of the big four—just enough to protect them from pirates and minor Yovi border skirmishes. They didn’t attack other FTL empires, content instead to trade peacefully. That being said, their fleet technology was said to be state-of-the-art, so I wasn’t about to underestimate them. *‘Smallest fleets. Peaceful traders’*.

As far as their economy went, however, the Veyla were a powerhouse beyond peer. Apparently, their government was ruled by merchant priests whose political influence was judged by their wealth. The wealthiest merchant priest supposedly owned a dyson sphere—a word I wasn’t familiar with. When I looked it up, though, my jaw damn-near hit the floor. *‘Leader has a dyson sphere—fully harvested star,’* I typed, barely able to believe the words clicking onto the page. Supposedly, this star supplied enough energy to fuel their entire empire, and every other merchant priest paid tribute to ‘exalted prophet’ for access to its power reserves. 

Checking their technology section for any further information on this harvested star, I didn’t find much. All the Gifrid were willing to tell us here was that within the orbit of that star was a planet containing primitive sapient life. The Veyla enslaved them, and now they mine day and night just for the privilege of their planet being heated. *‘Slavers. Dangerous’.*

For a species claiming to be composed of priests, the sheer callousness of their leader’s act stuck out as strange to me. Clearly, whatever beliefs they held were different from those of Earth’s religions, so I navigated down to the section on their faith and read through it.

Within Veyla cosmology, all of the matter and energy in the universe was originally concentrated into one all-powerful, all-benevolent being. They believe that this entity essentially shattered itself to become the universe and bring about life. It reminded me of Genesis thrown into a blender with the Big Bang. As far as the Veyla believed, the more matter and energy you owned, the more this deity’s undying spirit could guide you. As far as the Veyla were concerned, any endeavor that resulted in more stuff for one’s self was a holy pursuit. Their engineering, their government, their diplomacy—all of it was directed solely for the procurement and defense of their possessions. *‘Ruthless in pursuit of wealth. Do not trust!’* 

Saving the file for Stine and closing my laptop, I let out a groan of pent-up anxiety. For now, all we had to worry about was dealing with the Gifrid in orbit. Eventually, however, the time would come where we’d have to step onto the galactic stage proper and declare who our allies and enemies were. Deep down, I’d been hoping against hope for an easy answer—uncomplicated galactic ‘good guys’ we could cling to. However, none of the options listed in that data packet fit the bill. And yet, whether we were ready or not, we’d have to come together and make the choice. Because I got the feeling that if we didn’t buckle down and get our shit together, the next ships in Earth’s orbit wouldn’t be exploration vessels.",26,1759268136.0,HFY,6,1.0,False

I am a 27 year old female, 5'4""and I weigh 160lbs. . A few years ago I lost a lot of weight very quickly (nearly 30 punds in two months) due to stress. Then I slowly started to gain it back and I gained 10 pounds more than my original weight. My body composition is pear shaped, most of the weight has come in in my upper thighs, lower hips, and my face. Since gaining the weight about a year and a half ago, I have tried so many things to lose it it a healthy and manageable way.

I am honestly the healthiest I have ever been in terms of my nutrition, fitness, and general habits. I also am able to manage my stress much better. I dont understand why I can't lose the fat and I'm getting so frustrated! My goal weight is 130 pounds.

The things I think I'm doing right:

* I see a personal trainer once a week, I have been seeing her for almost a year now. I have gotten so much stronger and reached so many goals, I love it! I wish I could go more but I can't afford it.
* I try my very best to lift weights at least 1-2 times more a week on top of training. I also try to do reformer pilates 1-2 times a week when I can afford it.
* I eat very well, I even saw a dietician and she was very happy with my eating. All of my meals have high protein, and contain a fiber, a carb, and a healthy fat. I eat 3 meals a day and sometimes a small snack. Typical meals:
   * Lactose free greek yogurt with raspberries, chia seeds, walnuts and almonds (small amount). Also a black coffee with a scoop of creatine. I eat this everyday for breakfast.
   * Salad with arugula, cherry tomatoes, persian cucmber, chicken breast. Dressing is Olive oil, white vinegar, and dijon mustard.
   * shrimp and stir fried veggies with skinny rice noodles
* I sleep at least 8 hours a night
* I get at the very minimum 5k steps every day but I try my best to get 10k or more when I can. I'm also thinking about getting a walking pad to help me be less sedentary when working and being at home watching TV.
* I live in a city so I walk or ride my bike most places, no car.
* I even go to the far bathroom in my office building when I have to go, just to get more steps in
* I quit drinking 1.5 months ago and no change in my weight

Cons

* I work a desk job, so I'm sitting for a lot of the day
* I recently found out I snore, so I'm thinking I'm not getting proper deep sleep because of this. I wake up tired.

I haven't actually tracked my calories in an app, but my dietician did for me and was happy with my calorie intake and said if i kept it up and added in some more walking I should lose weight. I'm of course open to tracking, but I find it a bit overwhelming so if anyone has suggestions for apps? Also, I make a shit ton of soups and stews in the winter so I'm not really sure how to measure those in apps? Any advice is appreciated",1,1759268095.0,WeightLossAdvice,5,1.0,False

I think if a woman is confident in herself and the connection that she can manage to keep her man then she won't look at others as a threat. When I was with Ken, He was a 24 year old handsome bartender so my man was around drunk floozys all day and all night. He would tell me if girls hit on him and when we had a great bond, it didn't phase me as I knew at quittin time he was driving home to talk to me and only me. There was only one time I was jealous for real and that was when he took his hot coworker out for ice cream at 9pm on a night that was OUR date night. ""ice cream chick"" didn't even know he had a fiancé. I just felt that it was disrespectful to me. best believe I never let him forget it. I'm like oh that time you took that chick on a date for ice cream while your future WIFE was calling your phone and you hit ignore...oh yeah that time. lol My relationship with Jeff however was nothing but trust. I knew he went to work then stopped by his parents and was back home at 7pm to wait for my phone call. He was very loyal, probably the only thing I think well of him for. So yeah I think If the connection of trust is strong no one can break it. I'm possessive when it comes to the topic of sex with other women.”—— If I’m remembering correctly, Ken took that coworker out for ice cream because Ken said she was suicidal and Gypsy said the girl was faking it to get Ken’s attention and told him to look up Cinderella Syndrome. 


2.  Gypsy says to Jersey man, “I try and practice dancing when I can, it isn't easy not having the room or learning tools need to advance. Belly dancing peaked my interest when I watched a few at a fantasy convention. I have a talent for both erodic dancing and belly dancing. Lol Well well well, did I just peak your interest?:-P” Gypsy says, “As for my body shape, I have an hourglass figure. 35,25,36.” And Gypsy also asks if he has any pets. 


3.  Gypsy says to Jersey man, “Oh well I can't say I'm upset youre single. Out of respect for peoples relationships, I like to be aware so I'm not being disrespectful.
Now in hindsight I'm glad I didn't get married. Its not that I'm against marriage I just feel now looking back he wasn't right for me. Took me a bit to find myself though. But I still think I'd look good in a white dress. lol Yes, I am a Leo. :-) And yes, Scorpios have that reputation for being um... well experienced. I am the complete opposite end of things, I'm not experienced because of my lack of freedom throughout my life. The brief experience I did had was awful! I wont have casual sex. To be honest I just want to share myself with someone I love, even it it means it takes years to fall in love before I have sex after I get out of prison, that is how I feel. Oh and I do have a fetish, it’s called Kitten play. I try and practice dancing when I can, it isn't easy not having the room or learning tools I need to advance. Belly dancing peaked my interest when I watched a few at a fantasy convention. I have a talent for both erodic dancing and belly dancing. Lol Well well well, did I just peak your interest? :-P “ Gypsy also says, “Its alright I had received your long one that you wrote on your flight and I replied to it, but it make take a little longer to get to you as I said the word sex like 5 times! lol:-P I was explaining how I'm the opposite end of the spectrum with experience in that area. also may have offered a private dance. lol and a little something about Kitten play. *Meow* “ . 


4.  Gypsy says to Jersey man, “at the Ren faires that you have seen, was there any belly dancers? I dance a little and I want to enter a competition for belly dancing. Omg its beautiful! America is so boring compared the the beauty of other countries. I don't think I'd be so out of place over there in a corset and choker. lol You're like a Renaissance Christian Gray...minus the whole fetish bit. So do I need to be aware of calling you and upsetting a Mrs Pagan?:P “ Gypsy also says, “That sounds like a rough start to your travels. I'm glad you arrived safely. No, You didn't say anything stupid, I would tell you if you did. To be honest I've never had alcohol so I do not know the feeling. would like to try wine though” then Gypsy says, “So tell me more about yourself in terms of your life and this amazing and kind of exotic way you live. You've been living in New York currently, what part?
You mentioned youre an IT, do you find it hard to manage a life partly in the U.S and partly abroad? Do you have family ties to either place? You can absolutely tell me if I'm too curious. lol I've just never met someone with a thirst for life and experience like you. I find it very intriguing” 


5.  Jersey man says to Gypsy, “I’m writing this on my flight so it might be lengthy....
Aww I'm glad you liked my voice. I won't be too busy the next few weeks so you can definitely expect more emails. I'll get the phone thing squared away too then we can figure out a regular schedule. I want to hear your voice more!!!;-p You don't have to worry about calling and upsetting anyone>.< I'm heading to Europe all by my lonesome and I'm not married anyway. I actually got married right before I went to prison when I was 19 but that didn't last long and I was divorced by my 2nd year of incarceration. I've had girlfriends since I've been out and even one fiancée but that's a long story I'll tell you about in the near future. But back to me traveling alone.. I do it ALL of the time. Most of my friends have families or other obligations 90% of the time so it's hard to get anyone to travel most of the time. I always ask people but I don't put my life on hold. I just go where I want whether anyone can make it or not. Sometimes people come but 75% I explore on my own and meet people. I'm very social! However, this trip I have a colleague meeting me in Greece next week. Then I have two friends from Miami and Boston that got married and moved to Greece in his deceased father's awesome villa. It can sleep 14-16 people and is right up the street from an absolutely gorgeous beach! So I'll meet them to go hiking in some ancient ruins and stuff like that. Then I have another friend that's coming to Greece near the end of June. So I'll meet up with them also:-) So l agree with some of your astrology book for my birthday but the possessive part is WAY OFF. I'm the complete opposite. I've never been that way and in fact was in a relationship where it was the other way around. I had an ex that pretty much caused me to lose a bunch of friendships and family relationships. She was super possessive and didn't want me hanging out with any of my friends unless she was there... then when she came she caused problems so my friends didn't even want to be around me if she was there. It was horrible. I had to walk on eggshells or she'd go crazy. So basically I'm completely against that. I believe in people being themselves with no confines. I'm the least jealous person you'll meet.:-) The rest isn't spot on but has some truth to it. Definitely a turbulent nature but think I manage it well. I can be impulsive and an extremist but only in the best of ways. I enjoy pleasing! like making people happy. I am a protector by virtue and only use aggression out of defense and won't be pushed around. My temper doesn't exist. I left that in prison years ago. I prefer laughter and joking about things (often joking at the wrong times). I agree and consider myself to be persuasive, energetic, colorful, and with some power. I can totally be spellbound, sometimes morbidly dark, and extensively sexual. I think Scorpios have a reputation for being sexual I didn't know we were drawn to Leo's. Aren't you one?!?! Lol I feel so bad that the vaccine made you so sick! I'm not getting that shit unless they force me to. I'm not a conspiracy theorist but there's a bunch of shady shit going on in the world today. As for belly dancers at ren faires; yes! I've seen some! I've never seen a contest but people dress in all kinds of stuff and I've definitely seen belly dancer type outfits. I've also seen some acts or shows at ren faires that aren't strictly belly dancing but the act might include and incorporate some belly dancing. Oh and my jaw just dropped when you said you want to enter a competition! Do you practice a lot? I’d probably lose my shit if saw you belly dancing with your stomach exposed and your hips moving. I bet it would be fucking fire! You're pretty petite so I bet you have an outrageous body. You remind me of Wonder Woman lol And I totally agree with you that America is boring in comparison to the beauty, architecture, and cultures”


6.  Gypsy says to Jersey man, “Omfg this place is insane! some asshole C.O threatened to write me up for washing my hands in the bathroom and getting a cup of water from the bathroom sink after 10pm. He said the day room is closed so therefore I can't wash my hands after going the restroom. I didn't catch his name but he is a random, he doesn't work this house normally but I dropped a kite to the housing manager on his ass. That has never been a thing, we have always been able to wash our hands, and he wants to come in and make a stupid unhygienic rule. Bitch please write me. Anyway thanks for letting me vent. I act all calm in front of them but inside I’m like WTF!”.  Jersey man says to Gypsy, “OMG HOLY FUCK THIS IS LONG: Ok so here's the long response.. it might be randomized but l'll mostly try to reply to your messages in order:-) That's great that Securis is implementing video visits. Keep me posted on that. I downloaded the google voice app yesterday but it will only let me have the calls forwarded to a U.S. number so I'm going to have to play around with that a bit or try other apps. Can you ask your friend what they use? The online visitation application was easy to find as well as instructions on sending books. Are there any books you have in mind? Til be in europe for at least the entire Summer so I’ll take a look at everything else before I'm back this autumn. That's crazy how visits need to be reserved in advance now but hopefully that goes away when covid disappears. You definitely need to binge the rest of Game of Thrones. 8 seasons is pretty long but I hope to watch them all again sometime. OMG what a piece of shit! Did you actually get written up for washing your hands in the day room after 10pm or did they drop it? Just stay away from him if you see him anymore. It's not worth the trouble even if you were in the right. And feel free to vent any time. Believe me, I KNOW how frustrating those experiences can be in there. As for your shows; I've never seen discovery of witches but I'll check it out if I happen upon it. I'm not a huge tv watcher but I have my moments where I binge. I've seen a few 90 day fiancé and it's just completely ridiculous but entertaining. I saw a bunch of walking dead episodes but one day I'll have to binge from start to finish. I liked Merlin, Xena, Robinhood, etc... those are right up my alley. If I just flip on the TV and sit down for 10 or 20 minutes I usually have a comedy like family guy, king of queens, Simpsons, or impractical jokers. Otherwise I'll check what's on ID channel or see if any good sci-fi or fantasy movies are on. As for being in shape... well I'm not out of shape but definitely not where I should be. I must have put on 20 pounds during covid but for me that's not a big deal. My weight has fluctuated between 205-240 back and forth over and over again since high school... even without working out! I was probably about 215 in the shirtless pick. That was a year ago. Right now I'm closer to 230. I'm going to be super active with tons of hiking, swimming, and cliff diving this summer so l'll probably be back down to 210 or so if I don't eat too crazy and drink too much beer. Lol Oh and I'm glad I haven't said anything too reckless yet because sometimes I'm oblivious to any filter. I'm absolutely in awe that you have an hour glass figure. I mean I heard of it but had no idea what it was exactly aside from some curves so looked it up. I read that an hour glass figure is the optimal most sought after physique historically that most women would die for! So apparently you're pretty damn blessed! Omg I bet your hips are amazing then! Soo edible. But you look so petite to me! You're probably less than half my weight! It's hard to tell under state clothing but you must have an incredible ass too then. I know you said you've never had alcohol so you wouldn't know how it feels. It's tough to say as it affects everyone differently. I get happy and loopy and sometimes talkative. Some people get emotional or angry. The closest thing is probably to some medications. Maybe like a half a Xanax but I don't really know. A lot of people drink wine throughout the world though and doctors say red wine has some benefit. Maybe you can do some Wicca with red wine in a chalice! Yes I had a rough start to my trip. I've been EXHAUSTED from sleep deprivation. From New Jersey to Washington DC to Frankfurt Germany to Poland and then finally to Ukraine took me close to 2 days all because my flight out of DC was delayed 3 hours. Otherwise it would have only taken me like 14 hours or so. I only slept about 3 hours total while on the planes so I shut down and slept like crazy after arriving. Have you been on a plane before?” Gypsy says to Jersey man, “So I may or may not have mentioned I'm in the stages of writing a book about my life, a much deeper look into my past, and this time during my incarceration. It won't release until I'm home and it will be a tripple platform experience. A book, podcast and documentary. Randomhouse is who I'd be partnered with. The book highlights what I've kept private, things very few know and my perspective on my time in here. The podcast will be an interview like experience and the documentary will film me post prison. I'll have to do PR for the book as well as go on a book tour, hopefully taking me abroad as well. This book will be my way of becoming my ""tell all"" After this no one should have even one question about ""why this or why that?"" everything will be lay bare for anyone to read and at that point, I can start living my life away from media.” 


7.  Gypsy says to Jersey man, “No, I didn't get a write up for washing my hands.
oh what I meant by I'm possessive in the sense that in my relationships while being locked up, my partner and I had the conversation of the boundaries of the relationship and I put how I feel out there I'm like I know you have needs but so do I, but that is no excuse to be able to fuck other women. So it was mutually agreed that until I get out, no sex. Its phone sex with me and hell even a pocketP and porn is fine. But no other women. Some women in here don't care, I DO, to me it’s cheating. Ive been dealt a shitty hand with experience. Let's just some it up to twice with my co defendant and neither time was it good. Ive never been pleased. Yes, I drink coffee. No I dont wear glasses My eyes are brown. My favorite color is lavender and sapphire blue. First kiss was a peck with one guy, second kiss was again my codefendant and he sucked at kissing, my third was Ken and THAT was the kiss that got me in trouble but it was the best kiss I've ever had. I'm actually a pretty good French kisser.:-) Kisses are allowed on visits but they restrict it to a peck, this was full on make out lol”, Jersey man says to Gypsy, “totally understand how you want to be aware so you're not disrespectful about someone's relationship. So yeah I'm single. Honestly, fucked up big time. My whole life it's always been me dumping my girlfriend because she did something fucked up or cheated on me. This time I was the idiot. My girlfriend was pretty awesome but we had an argument and when I was mad at her I did a search for dating apps in the internet. I used an app and asked someone if they'd want to grab dinner or a drink sometime. The chat wasn't lengthy or indecent in any way and I never followed through or pursued anything. It's not like I met anyone or had sex with somebody but yeah I screwed up big time. She saw the search history on the computer and the message in the app. So here I am in Europe all single and alone. She hasn't spoken to me but we lived together so we have some shared bills to take care of plus we went halves to share in some small investments. So I don't know when that will be resolved. Like you said, it's probably for the better that you didn't get married. I'm sure you'd look amazing in a white dress but it's definitely not something to dive into, especially while incarcerated. Being behind those walls can cloud your vision and not realize how many options and opportunities will come your way once you're out. Patience my pet! Your time will come. Trust me, I know you've been finding yourself but there will be so much more to find. So don't be hasty! I totally understand that your lack of freedom has hindered your experience. But you seem to have an inner flame and playfulness that's half the battle. Besides, kitten play is adorable and hot as fuck! You'll be a pro in no time! LOL Have you ever had kittens? They clean each other by licking. Maybe I'll lick you sometime :D That's incredible that you're willing to sacrifice and wait for the person you love. All too many people don't have those ideals. When the time comes, the right person is going to make you feel things and have your body do things that you never imagined even possible. Especially since you're going to wait for the emotional bond to generate your physical prowess. I know there's not much room in the cells but at least you can still practice your dancing a little. Do you ever feel awkward in front of your bunky? I didn't know you practiced erotic dancing too. So yes! You piqued my interest Hahahhah We'll most definitely have to see about that private show ;p You never mentioned that you were doing a ""tell all"" or writing a book but that's great! It makes total sense as part of your reentry to society and route back to some normalcy. I'm amazed that you've been able to pull all that stuff together from in there. Did you have any help? You need to be very careful who knows about that stuff. You wouldn't want any of your work to be stolen or leaked. But good for you. That mic drop sounds like a perfect way to get away from the media.”


8.  Gypsy says to Jersey man, “Do you think you've learned from the cycle of things what you need to work on yourself to be able to sustain a relationship instead of repeating the pattern? I mean that wasn't the best move to try and chat up some other chick but, I can understand being upset. I think men forget that unless it’s really fucked up what someone does, no one is perfect so don't throw away a good thing over something that is not a deal breaker. Lol yes, I know all too well how cats behave. And I would say I'm adventurous and skys the limit with a lover. As long as I'm within a trusted safe relationship, I'm a freeeeak lol :-P No I never feel awkward around my bunkie, she knows me well and we laugh and have fun a lot. She is like an older sister” Gypsy also says, “Hey there! :-) It was a 3 day weekend so they are catching up sending emails. I read all of your massive email from last week. Wow it seems like you have done a lot of experimental work with life and what you want from it. that's great. :-) having a plan for yourself is important. I had a friend who lived his life with NO ambition to do anything! all because he is a felon. He caught a weapons charge for explosives. anyway he is 34 still lives with daddy and doesn't have any prospects in life. He kinda liked me a little but when he would hint to anything romantic I'm like, ‘I don't think I'm the right fit for you.’ So you definitely have it together more than most.” —- this is about Bryan. 


9.  Jersey man says to Gypsy, “Hey Gypsy!
I hope all is well. I've thought about you over the past several years and somehow am finally building up the courage to contact you. I'm sure you get hundreds of letters so I'm not even sure that you'll read mine but I figure what the heck. I pretty much just want to say that everything you ve been through weighs on my conscience at times so some part of my inner being has compelled me to just kinda make sure that you're doing okay. I hope you're treated well and don't have any problems. I know there's not much that people on the outside can do to help but let me know if there's anything you need or that might be in my power to assist with. I figure you don't need money in your account since you're famous and all but I'd be more than happy to order you any books or anything else you might need. It would be great to hear back from you so 1 pre-paid for any replies you might send. Just want to wish you the best and tell you never give up hope because there are people out here that believe in you.” Gypsy responds and says, “Thank you for writing me. l am doing well, it has been a short 6 years, however I probably aged just as much. I've been able to gain some maturity over the time I've been incarcerated, learning through trial and error. That's life. I have been able to find myself and really figure out what I want from life going forward. :-) No I do not need any money, Not for the reasons you think though, I actually have never been paid for doing the shows and interviews My father has been supporting my needs in prison for the last 6 years. And last week, I just received my stimulus checks. :-) And if you knew me well you would know even if offered, I don't accept anything from anyone. I try to be humble for what I have.” 


10.  Jersey man says to Gypsy, “Hey Gypsy! I got 4 more of your messages! Haha! So you figured out I'm a Scorpio from the last picture with my other tattoo? I'm glad you liked it and wrote me back just because of it. My birthday is November 11th. Isn't your birthday just around the corner? July right? Is the astrology birthday book usually pretty on point? I'm curious what it says about me. I'll tell you if its right or wrong.:-P I'm definitely more computer geek than Rockstar although I can play guitar fairly well. I only recently grew out my hair over the past few years kind of on a whim. Are a lot of girls pagan/wicca in prison or is that just an affinity you have? I was kind of forcibly raised to be Catholic as a child with Sunday school classes and whatnot but as I got a little older I'd walk in the front door and right out the back LMAO. Aside from that, I'm not really a religious person. I mean don't get me wrong. I totally believe in the supernatural and being spiritual but I just don't spend much time with it. I also don't affiliate myself with any religion because my own belief system is made up from ALL religions in a way. That's really neat that you're learning to read cards! I'm surprised the prison allows them. I had mine done by some fake psychic like 10 years ago but she was so wrong I don't think that really counts. Maybe you can read mine one day and tell me? It's nice to hear you've never had to experience the hole. I was sent there several times during my stint. The messed up thing is I never did anything to deserve to go! One time a C.O. that just didn't like me wrote me up because I was sleeping and not at my vocational trade. I tried to tell him that our teacher was out for the day but he wasn't trying to listen and sent me to lockup over nothing! Another time there was a really bad fight in the cell across from me. The officers knew I saw everything but I wouldn't snitch. So they put me in the hole a week for not giving them any information which is bullshit. The funny thing is that anytime I actually got in a fight I never got caught. OMG I have tons of stories! You got really lucky with only 8 hours for the tattoo! Is it small? Tattoos were automatic 15-30 days in the hole at a minimum where I was. You must be a good luck charm since you didn't get in much trouble for the kiss either. I don't want to be intrusive but I'm assuming that you didn't get much time to meet guys and do stuff like that before. I'm still in awe that you got engaged while there. It must have seemed amazing at time. I hope the breakup wasn't hard on you. In my opinion, I don't think its a good idea to date while locked up. Not only have I seen how people end up leaving and forgetting about inmates but I've experienced it. It can become an emotional roller coaster that isn't easy to deal with. Then again its hard for someone to not want to date because love and affection are a human need. I'm sure it’s a long story but that wasn't very nice of Ken to push you away. Then look at you!!! A little player huh? hahaha.. You didn't waste any time callings Jeff You go girl ;D Its great that you felt like you complemented each other well. That's really important. I can kind of understand the whole father figure thing but I thought you said your father helps you out now. Eh, I guess its still way different. What I don't totally understand is why he would get so mad over you posting something. To me that's like a red flag for being too controlling. Then again, tons of people destroy relationships over their social media. Then to top it off he yelled at you? Oh hell no! I'm not into all that confrontational stuff. Why would he yell at you? That's way too aggressive for someone sweet like you. If it was that easy to leave then it wasn't meant to be anyway. Besides, you're going to have guys throwing themselves at you left and right when you get out. You don't want to be tied down right now. Maybe tied up but not tied down. lol” 


11.  Gypsy says to Jersey man, “Yes, longer emails take longer however I'm still waiting on a simple picture from my friend in Italy and he sent that pic last Monday! so who knows how long some take. Our Wicca service has 7 girls.:-) so not many are of this religion but we started a service last month. Sure I'll read your cards,...once I learn how to. lol My astrology book is fairly correct. Though I already know about you Scorpios, got a naughty reputation lol No, I don't have Internet at all, the jpay service is for emails and that's it, and its not even a service I can email someone's regular email address they have to make a jpay first. Yes, my tattoo is small about a little under an inch. I say it stands for Karma is a kick in the ass. lol No one needs to know it’s an ex. And unfortunately I have to say the break up was absolutely devastating to me back then. I self destructed and it took me a very long time to recover. Now I don't trust anyone with my heart. To answer your question, No I didn't have the experience to date while I was in my life from before so this whole break up thing is new, and the emotions are new. Dating was not something I chose, it chose me because I couldnt control the feelings I had for Ken and Jeff neither times did I expect to get with them, it just happened.
Anyways, Jeez the whole summer in Europe! wow that's got to cost a fortune! Can I ask a favor? It is my ultimate dream to see the northern liahts, if you are awake on a night they appear, can you please send me a picture?”

1nuptog,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalproductselling/comments/1nuptog/how_i_turned_reddit_complaints_into_a_tiny/,How I turned Reddit complaints into a tiny product that actually helped ppl,"A few months ago i noticed a ton of reddit threads where ppl were complaining about how hard it is to get the right career skills for jobs these days and it clicked lol… theres a real problem here people are literally begging someone to fix.

so i tried something, here’s what i did… you can literally copy this if u want.

ok first i just scrolled subs, fb groups, forums… just watching ppl complain and repeat the same stuff over and over
looked for things that had no simple answers and kept popping up everywhere.

Then i made a tiny little product, nothing fancy
short pdf + tiny workbook + cheat sheet
low cost, easy to get, solves ONE problem
didnt try to make it fancy or “perfect” or whatever just focus on dropping correct as u go tbh.
I also priced it super cheap like 4–15$ depending on niche ,people spend that on coffee or random amazon junk anyway

Next i put it where ppl actually are, dont wait for “followers”
reddit, fb groups, whatever
just shared tiny snippets, 1–2 tips, a checklist… let ppl see it solves a problem
if they want the full thing its obvious next step

Also tested stuff:
different wording
small audiences first
added little incentives when needed

Mistakes i made:
•overcomplicating my first product
•posting in dead groups
•explaining way too much, ppl dont need a ted talk to buy a $4 thing

realistic results: first time doing this you’re probably looking at 50–500$ a month in a small niche
dont expect 20k+ first month bullshit

so yeah… curious
what niche problems have u noticed that nobody is solving yet? drop one below 👇",4,1759267699.0,digitalproductselling,1,0.83,False
1nuptf5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1nuptf5/not_every_relationship_is_worth_saving_believe_me/,"Not every relationship is worth saving, believe me.","Here's my story.

I didn’t chase her. What drew me in was her interest. The way she always wanted to be near me, brushing my arm, laughing at my jokes, finding excuses to stay close. It started as a joke about sharing a bottle of beer, and somehow it became something more. At first, it felt mutual. She showed up, I showed up, and it grew from there.

We worked together, which made everything more complicated. From the start, she wanted to keep us a secret. Said it was better that way. I didn’t understand it. Maybe she liked the thrill. Maybe she wanted freedom. I went along with it, thinking it was about privacy. But love shouldn’t have to hide. Secrets don’t protect a relationship. They slowly poison it.

I gave her everything I could. I drove 200 kilometers a day just to see her for an hour more. Long drives, short visits. I thought effort meant love, that consistency would prove everything. But when effort isn’t mirrored, it just turns into exhaustion.

She wanted more than love. She wanted money. It wasn’t about building something together. It was about what she could get. Gifts, dinners, trips, help. I didn’t mind giving, but eventually I realized giving was all I was doing. When she missed her dog back home, I bought her plane tickets to her hometown so she could see it. I thought it would make her happy. But with her, there was always something missing, something new to want.

The red flags came early. Our boss had a reputation everyone knew. Slept with employees, blurred lines, got too close. I warned her, told her to be careful. She laughed and said, “He’s like a brother.”

A few days later, I got a text I’ll never forget:  
“Morning babe, nothing bad happened, something happened though, it’s nothing bad, we’ll talk when we’re face to face.”

She told me he’d picked her and her friend up, took them out for drinks, dropped them home. Swore nothing happened. But something did. Maybe not physically, but emotionally. I wanted to trust her, so I did. But trust doesn’t sound the same after the first crack.

After that, everything shifted. If I didn’t text her for three hours, she’d snap, saying she didn’t feel like she had a boyfriend. Meanwhile, she could go silent, go drinking, push boundaries, and I was supposed to stay calm. I always spoke up. I tried to talk, to explain, to fix things. When that didn’t work, we argued. When arguing didn’t work, I started mirroring her. Silence for silence, distance for distance. That’s when the foundation gave way.

She kept comparing me to her exes. Told me how they’d fight, how they’d act, how I was too calm. She didn’t want peace. She wanted familiarity. And her version of familiar was chaos.

I gave her everything I could. Affection, loyalty, small acts of love. I designed a bracelet for her, silver with sapphires, made from scratch. She didn’t even want to see it. Said she only wore gold. That’s when I realized she didn’t care about sentiment. She cared about status.

She didn’t trust me either. She brought up a close friend of mine constantly. Someone who’s like a sister to me, thousands of kilometers away. That friend even went out of her way to comfort her, to make her feel secure. But she turned her into a threat. Every conversation became an argument. Every disagreement became deflection. I told her, “Stop attacking me. Attack the problem.” She never could.

When I ended up in the hospital one night with chest pains and high blood pressure, she didn’t even ask what hospital I was in. She stayed at dinner with the boss. That was the moment my body said no before my mind could. I should’ve listened then.

The final straw came when she broke her last promise. She swore she’d never go drinking with the boss again unless I was there. That night, she did. I told her I was done. Done chasing someone who made me question my worth. Done loving harder just to be met with less.

Even after we broke up, she didn’t let go. She’d still call, reach out, ask for favors, try to pull me back in. One night, while I was on work trip, she kept calling over and over again. Wouldn’t stop. I finally answered, exhausted, and told her, “For this to work, I’d have to be controlling, manipulative, and toxic. Is that what you want?”

She said yes. Because that’s what she was used to. And I remember thinking, did I really have to carry all that baggage? Did I have to become someone else just to be loved by her? That’s when I said it, calmly and firmly: “I’m not going to change for anybody. Not for you. Not for anyone.” And I meant it. Because love that demands you become someone else isn’t love. It’s a performance.

After that, I knew I was done. I started putting distance between us. She’d bring me coffee. I’d pour it out the window. Told her that I didn't want anything from her even if I was going to die. Also I told her once, “You don’t have real friends if they’re telling you to reach out to me for help.” She snapped, said I didn’t know anything. Maybe I didn’t. But I knew she wasn’t ready to face herself.

She got close to the boss’s son after that. The same guy who used to hit on her. The same one she told me not to worry about. The same one with assault and harassment cases. Now she’s with him.

When I overheard him say “I love you” to her, I laughed. Then the laughter faded. My chest tightened, my hands shook, and I couldn’t breathe. That wasn’t heartbreak. That was my body remembering all the times I stayed when I should’ve left.

Eventually, it all caught up. She got fired after being seen with him. And me? I quit. Walked out on my own terms.

Now, I see it clearly. She didn’t want peace. She wanted chaos dressed as passion. She didn’t want love. She wanted someone to fight with, not someone to build with. And I can’t blame her for what she was used to, but I won’t be the man who repeats her past.

Looking back now, I’m grateful it ended. Grateful I got to see the truth, even if it hurt. Grateful that the mask slipped before it was too late. At first, I thought I’d lost something rare but now I know I just made room for something real.

TLDR: Fell for someone who showed interest first. Gave everything, time, money, effort. She wanted attention and cash, not love. Ignored warnings, broke promises, compared me to her exes. I got sick from stress, she didn’t care. After we split, she still tried to pull me back. Told her to go away. Now I'm peaceful. ",1,1759267682.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1nupt21,https://i.redd.it/sjw9scezddsf1.jpeg,Quality espresso in Italy,"I’m about halfway through my trip around Italy and I’ve finally found some espresso worth sharing. We’re currently in Riomaggiore and just stopped for dinner at a restaurant called Fuori Rotta off of Via Telemaco Signorini. The food was excellent, but that’s not a surprise around here. What did surprise me was the dessert menu that included four different bean options. 



All four were listed as 100% arabica; one Mexican, two Honduran, and a single origin Ethiopian. No roast levels were indicated, but I opted for one of the Hondurans for its alleged dark chocolate and red fruit tasting notes. I was served the shot along with a sugar packet as typical in Italy, but it absolutely did not need it. It was a very balanced shot with my only critique being that it was a little thin. Of course that is probably because I’ve grown accustomed to the more syrupy, classic Italian-style shots I’ve been getting so far. 



For anyone traveling through Cinque Terra, definitely check this place out. The views are incredible, the food is top notch, and the coffee definitely makes the trek up the hill worth it. ",6,1759267660.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1nuprk1,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/1nuprk1/the_immortal_roommate_conundrum_chapter_1/,[The Immortal Roommate Conundrum] - Chapter 1,"Living with John was like sharing an apartment with a walking, talking history textbook that insisted it was just a regular guy who ""really liked documentaries."" Alex, was 99% sure John was immortal, but that pesky 1% of doubt kept him from going full Mulder from The X-Files. The evidence was overwhelming, but John's knack for dodging questions and Alex's stubborn grip on rationality made their apartment a comedic battleground of suspicion and denial.

It all started when Alex moved into the cozy two-bedroom in Brooklyn, lured by the suspiciously low rent and John's chill vibe during the Craigslist meetup. John was a lanky dude with a mop of dark hair, perpetually wearing flannel like he was auditioning for a grunge band that never disbanded. He had this ageless quality—could've been 25 or 45, depending on the lighting—and a smile that said, ""I know something you don't, but let's not make a thing of it."" Alex, a data analyst with a penchant for overanalyzing everything, thought he'd scored the perfect roommate. Quiet, tidy, paid rent on time. What's not to love?

Then the weirdness began.

**The Suspicious Skill Set**

John was too good at everything. Like, annoyingly good. Alex first noticed it during a lazy Sunday when they decided to play Super Smash Bros. on the Switch. Alex, who'd spent his college years grinding out combos, expected to wipe the floor with John. Instead, John picked Kirby, button-mashed like a caffeinated toddler, and somehow executed frame-perfect combos that would've made a pro gamer weep.

""Beginner's luck,"" John mumbled, barely looking at the screen.

Alex squinted. ""You've played this before.""

John just shrugged and said, ""Nah, I just have quick fingers. Used to type a lot of... uh, letters.""

*Letters? Who says letters in 2025?*

Then there was the cooking. Alex, whose culinary expertise peaked at instant ramen, came home one night to John whipping up a five-course meal that looked like it belonged on Chef's Table. Coq au vin, handmade gnocchi, a soufflé that didn't collapse—Alex was gobsmacked.

""Where'd you learn this?"" he asked, mouth full of truffle-infused whatever.

John, stirring a sauce with the precision of a surgeon, said, ""Oh, you know, I worked in a kitchen... for a bit.""

When Alex pressed for details, John pivoted to, ""Hey, you catch that new Star Wars show?"" Classic deflection.

It wasn't just games and food. John could fix anything—a leaky faucet, a lagging laptop, the neighbor's ancient VCR. He spoke fluent Spanish, Mandarin, and what Alex swore was medieval Latin during a heated phone call John claimed was ""just a prank."" One time, Alex caught him restringing a guitar left-handed, then playing it right-handed, then switching back like it was nothing.

""Just ambidextrous,"" John said, tuning the strings with his eyes closed.

Alex wasn't buying it. No one's that talented. It was like living with a Swiss Army knife in human form.

**The Pain Thing (Or Lack Thereof)**

John's relationship with pain was... let's call it nontraditional.

Alex first clocked it during a particularly chaotic move-in day. They were hauling a couch up three flights of stairs (because of course the elevator was broken), and John, carrying the heavier end, slipped and smashed his hand against the railing. Alex heard the crunch—a sound that made his own fingers curl in sympathy.

""Dude, you okay?"" Alex yelped, expecting blood, tears, or at least a colorful string of swears.

John just glanced at his mangled hand, where his pinky was bent at an angle that screamed ""emergency room."" He wiggled it, popped it back into place with a casual snap, and said, ""Yeah, it's fine. Just a sprain.""

A sprain? Alex's brain short-circuited. He'd once cried for an hour over a stubbed toe, and here was John treating a broken finger like it was a mildly annoying hangnail.

It kept happening. One night, John tripped over Alex's dumbbells (left out because Alex was ""working on fitness"") and dislocated his shoulder hitting the coffee table. Alex, panicking, was halfway through dialing 911 when John stood up, rolled his shoulder back into place with a pop that echoed like a gunshot, and said, ""Whoops, clumsy me."" Then he grabbed a beer and started humming a sea shanty. A sea shanty. Alex stared, mouth agape, as John overacted a wince five seconds too late, like he'd just remembered humans are supposed to feel pain.

The kicker was the time John got a paper cut opening Alex's Amazon package (because John was ""just helping""). Alex braced for the usual yelp, but John just stared at the cut, which stopped bleeding in seconds, and said, ""Huh, that's... ouchy.""

Ouchy? Alex googled ""human healing speed"" that night and found nothing to explain John's Wolverine-level recovery.

**The Historical Photo Jackpot**

Alex's suspicions hit fever pitch when he did something he wasn't proud of: he snooped. John had gone out to ""meet a friend"" (at 3 a.m., because apparently John didn't sleep either), and Alex, fueled by too much coffee and a true-crime podcast, rummaged through John's closet. Buried under a pile of flannel shirts was a locked wooden box. Alex, who'd once picked a lock to impress a date (and failed spectacularly), managed to jimmy it open with a paperclip and sheer desperation.

Inside were photos. Old photos. Really old photos. Grainy black-and-whites of a guy who looked exactly like John, posing with people in top hats and hoop skirts. One was signed, ""To John, thanks for the whiskey—Abraham L., 1862."" Another showed John (or John's doppelgänger) in a World War I uniform, arm around a grinning soldier. There was even a Polaroid from the '70s, with John rocking bell-bottoms next to a guy who looked suspiciously like Andy Warhol.

Alex confronted John the next morning, waving the photos like a prosecutor at a trial. ""Explain this!"" he demanded.

John barely glanced at them. ""Oh, those? Family heirlooms. Great-uncle John, grandpa John, cousin John. We all look alike. Crazy genetics, right?"" He flashed that infuriatingly calm smile and offered Alex a pancake.

Alex wasn't hungry. He was livid. ""Crazy genetics"" didn't explain why ""cousin John"" had the same exact scar above his left eyebrow as current John.

**The 1% Doubt**

Despite the mountain of evidence, Alex clung to that 1% doubt. Maybe John was just a freakishly talented, pain-resistant history buff with a family of lookalikes. Maybe he was a method actor prepping for a role as an immortal. Maybe Alex was losing it. But every time he leaned toward rationality, John would do something like juggle knives ""for fun"" or mention he ""missed the old speakeasies"" with a wistful sigh.

The worst part? John was a great roommate. He paid rent early, cleaned the dishes, and never hogged the TV. He even helped Alex with his taxes, somehow knowing loopholes from the 1920s. Alex wanted to believe John was just quirky, not a 500-year-old enigma who'd probably arm-wrestled Leonardo da Vinci.

One night, after John reset his own sprained ankle with the nonchalance of someone tying a shoelace, Alex snapped. ""Are you immortal or what?"" he blurted.

John froze, then laughed—a little too hard. ""Immortal? Nah, I just... take care of myself. Eat kale, you know?"" He winked and turned up the radio, blasting ABBA to drown out further questions.

Alex didn't buy it. But he also didn't move out. The rent was too good, and honestly, living with a maybe-immortal was kind of fun. He just hoped John wouldn't outlive him by a millennium. Or ask him to help hide a sword collection. Again.

And my friend was telling me about his life, his frat, and his banjo and I felt like the outside world was nonexistent bc the sun was shining, and that bagel tasted like heaven. I want to give up control, but I don’t think I can. He knows how to make me tick, if I’m around him I know I’ll eat, but maybe that’s not a bad thing. My greatest fear confirmed, but how can something that tastes and feels so good hurt me so so much? I need to stay empty, but I love food more than anything. When will it start to love me back? I want to heal and spend 50 more years just walking around campus with him. I’m going to beat this I know it because there are people who care and bagels to eat.

This Monday I had a date with a guy who I started kind of liking from Instagram. We never talked before, like we never actually exchanged a conversation over IG or any other social media. About Thursday last week he uploaded a picture in a pool where he looked very sexy and I replied to the picture that he looked nice to which he said that I was beautiful. The guy is a model for one of the biggest agencies here so he really stands out.

To that, I thought about telling him if he wanted to come over to my pool and we started texting for a short while and we arranged for monday. We talked about going to the gym and pool to which I didnt think would actually happen haha.

Monday comes and he wanted to come earlier because it was sunny. He arrives at 5pm, we go out for a coffee, talked a lot, he then asks if we should go to the gym around 630. We go to my apartment and we get dressed for the gym. We actually go to the gym, then to the pool then to the sauna. Still no kissing or nothing sexual.

I am quite charismatic and we could build a connection in that time, he opened up quite a bit in the pool and he told me about seeing each other again and such. He complimented my body like 3 times. He even told me he had zero expectations about the date but that I surpassed them all.

We then go back to my apartment and he asks arent you gonna kiss me? To which I immediately kiss him. We kissed for a while, it was already 10 pm and both of us had to start our day early so I offered to give him a ride home. We keep kissing in the car, he told me several times that I was beautiful. When we arrived to his apartment he tells me I am free every afternoon so just tell me when we see each other again. 

Now it’s Wednesday and we barely talked over text. I sent him a funny message about something we discussed on the date testing waters and not much of a conversation occurred so I didn’t propose a new time. I find it strange not to have any text conversation, usually people I am seeing or etc I do text during the day so I find it a little off lol (like he is not interested)

2 days ago we saw each other again. He came have dinner to my house. I was actually waiting for him with something cooked and when I told him what it was he told me he was allergic to one of the ingredients. We ended up ordering food (and he didnt offer to split at all) but we had a nice date. He was really hugging me and we connected quite a bit over that time. We still didnt have any sex, I am not that sure if he turns me on. He has the face of a twink but his body is huge, he is 1.87 meters and I am used to dating twinks but as the night progressed and he opened up I started getting a little bit turnt on.

During the date he told me doesnt like the idea of a daily chat, that he prefers seeing me instead of texting. To which I agree, I dont love texting much but at least a short check in is fine.

As soon as he leaves he sends me a message saying thank you for the amazing night. We chatted a bit and he told me he would have loved to stay at my house to sleep. I send him a voice message yesterday replying to that and asking about his mom (she got hospitalized the same day of our date) and it’s 17 hours since that message and he didn’t reply.

Now if he wont reply to that message then I am no longer initiating the proposal of seeing each other again. I really dont want to be pushing for that as I am not even that interested. Should I wait for him to initiate contact? how long should I be waiting? It makes me a bit anxious having to be waiting",0,1759267387.0,gaybros,3,0.25,False

1nupibv,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1nupibv/interview_in_a_week_would_it_be_rude_to_coffee/,Interview in a week. Would it be rude to coffee chat request a few school alumni to research the company?,"I’m a recent graduate trying to find my first full-time job. Applied to a business development role at a tech/operations company. 

Made it through the online assessment, the asynchronous interview, and the video interview.  Now only have 2 more rounds of interviews to go with the next round being in about a week.

My question is: would it be rude to reach out to school alumni to coffee chat them to gain a better understanding of working there so that I can be more prepared? These would all be people who I have worked directly with in student organizations or I have talked to in passing at events I’ve run.

My main concern is coming off as rude due to the last minute nature or annoying them by taking up their time.

I was about to post this right as the other birthday freebies post went up, so I figured I should wait a bit so as to avoid consecutive birthday posts.

After taking some inspiration from previous posts here and in the AwesomeFreebies subreddit, I went on a signup spree to see what kind of freebies I could get for my birthday. Below I've created a table of truly free freebies. (There were many other almost-free freebies that I got, but to comply with Rule 5, I won't post them. If you are really curious, I have another post in my profile that details them.) Spoiler: I hope you like dessert.

For some context, my birthday is August 18th. I am in central Texas, so some of these retailers and restaurants may not be available depending on your area. Pretty much all of the offers that expired on 8/31 or 9/1 are given at the beginning of the month, and pretty much all of the offers that expired on 9/16, 9/17, or 9/18 were given on my birthday. I signed up for nearly all of these in late June or early July ahead of time. I will also have a couple of other side-notes after the table. A blank entry in ""Has Welcome Freebie"" means ""No"" unless otherwise noted.

^(1) Denny's ended up changing their rewards program in early September 2025, so I lost this reward before its expiration date. Because of this change, I also don't know if this is still the birthday reward.

^(2) I saw many other reports of people needing a purchase to receive this reward, however, I never made a purchase between signing up and my birthday, yet I still received the reward. This may be YMMV.

^(3) I never received this reward on my birthday. After seeing reports of others contacting support, I decided to do so myself. After a couple of days, support got back to me and manually credited this coupon with an expiration date of 10/18.

^(4) I had seen reports that you were supposed to get a free Whataburger reward on your birthday, however, I hadn't seen any reports since Whataburger changed their rewards program in early 2025. Like Panera, I figured I'd reach out to support and give it a shot since I never received anything.

Now 8 months in, I started having issues, is not grinding as fine anymore. I've deep cleaned it, play with the settings of the grinder, the time and as fine as it can go. But the coffee is coming to coarse, causing my espressos to be very acidic or sour. And I can see in fact the espressos extracting faster.

1nupbd9,https://i.redd.it/xq00okrgadsf1.png,The Agentic Commerce Gold Rush Just Began.,"# Something HUGE is happening in the world of online business, and I wanted to make sure you all saw it before anyone else. 

Seriously. This is one of those moments we'll look back on. It's called Agentic Commerce, and it's going to completely flip how we sell things online. If you build with AI, run an agency, or are just getting into automation, you're in the right place at the right time.

**SO, WHAT EVEN IS AGENTIC COMMERCE?**

Okay, forget the fancy name for a second.

Imagine someone is talking to a chatbot because they want to buy a new pair of shoes. Right now, that bot would send them a link to a website. They'd have to go there, find the shoes, add them to a cart, and then fill out a bunch of forms.

Agentic Commerce changes all of that.

The customer just says, ""I want to buy these in a size 9,"" right in the chat. And boom. The AI handles the whole purchase right there. No new tabs, no websites, no checkout forms. Just a simple conversation.

This is all being powered by a new open standard that big names like OpenAI and Stripe are backing. Think of it like a new set of rules for the internet that lets AI agents and businesses talk to each other to make buying stuff incredibly easy.

**WHY SHOULD YOU CARE? (HINT: THIS IS THE GOLD RUSH PART)**

For all you AI builders and agency owners:

You can now offer something incredible to your clients. Instead of just building them a chatbot that answers questions, you can build them an AI that actually makes sales for them, 24/7. How cool is that? You'll help them make more money because it's so much easier for customers to buy. This is how you get way ahead of everyone else.

For everyone learning automation:

This is the next big thing. You're not just learning about chatbots anymore; you're learning how to automate an entire business from the first hello to the final sale. People who know how to do this are going to be in crazy high demand. There are so many cool things you could build with this!

**HOW CAN YOU START RIGHT NOW?**

This isn't just theory. You can jump on this today.

1. Get the scoop. Read the articles I linked below. Just let the ideas soak in and think about how this could work for you or your clients. It's exciting stuff.
2. Peek at the tech. The Agentic Commerce Protocol (the tech behind this) is open for anyone to look at. If you're a coder, you can start seeing how it works under the hood.
3. Think and talk about it. You don't need to be a tech wizard to start. Just brainstorm. How could this make a business you know better? Talk with your team or clients about it.
4. Use an AI to help you dream. The prompts below can help you come up with some awesome ideas.

**LLM PROMPTS TO GET YOU STARTED**

Here are some prompts you can use with your favorite LLM to start brainstorming:

* ""My client has a Shopify store that sells handmade jewelry. How could we use agentic commerce to get more people to buy their stuff? Give me 5 fun ideas.""
* ""Write a simple and friendly chat conversation where an AI helps someone buy a subscription to a coffee delivery service using agentic commerce.""
* ""What are the most important things to think about if I want to use the Agentic Commerce Protocol for a small business that sells digital art?""
* ""Write a simple note to a client explaining why agentic commerce is super exciting and how we could use it for their fashion brand. My client doesn't know much about tech.""

**CHECK THESE OUT**

Here are the articles that will tell you everything you need to know. Seriously, go read them!

* OpenAI: Buy it in ChatGPT (https://openai.com/index/buy-it-in-chatgpt/)
* Stripe: Developing an open standard for agentic commerce (https://stripe.com/blog/developing-an-open-standard-for-agentic-commerce)
* Agentic Commerce Dev: The Agentic Commerce Standard (https://www.agenticcommerce.dev/)

This is all just starting, and we're at the very beginning. I'd love to hear what you think in the comments. What ideas does this spark for you? How do you think this will change things? Let's figure this out and build some cool stuff together!",0,1759266494.0,n8n,6,0.25,False

My partner and I are relocating for work in the Financial District (FiDi) and are looking for real-world feedback on a few priorities, especially regarding the East Bay. We’re in our 30s, no kids. 

Our Hard Criteria:
1. 3-bed/2-bath single-family home (or large condo) under $7,000/
2. Safe public transit commute to FiDi, preferably less than 20-30 minutes. 

Preferences:
3. Slightly warmer or less fog if possible. 
4. At least some walkability to coffee shops, park for the dog, just little things. Quieter in the evenings but within 30 minutes to nightlife (public or w/ car) 

Key Questions for Locals:

1. Which specific neighborhoods or towns meet that criteria?

2. We are strongly considering the East Bay (Alameda/Oakland). As a woman using public transit for late-night commute, safety is kinda key. If safety reputation street by street, where exactly should I look?

3. Excluding rent, what is the single most surprisingly high monthly cost you deal with that East Coasters may not expect?

This whole trigeminy thing is messing with my head way more than I thought it would. Some days I feel like I can brush it off, like okay it’s just PVCs, doctors say they’re benign, whatever, move on with life. Then other times I’ll be sitting there, chest just skipping like crazy, and I get stuck spiraling thinking about potassium, magnesium, stress hormones, even whether the crappy sleep I’ve been having is feeding into it. I’ve had stretches where it goes quiet for weeks and I start convincing myself it’s over, but sure enough, boom, back in full force. It’s not even the physical side that’s the worst, it’s the mental loop of “why now, what triggered this, how long is this flare going to last.”

And I’ll catch myself trying to play detective: was it that beer I had a few weeks ago before I quit drinking? Is it rebound from quitting alcohol? Is it stress? Too much coffee? Not enough electrolytes? It feels like chasing ghosts. Then you go down rabbit holes online about LVOT PVCs and stress physiology and how everything in your body is tied together in ways that you can’t fully measure on bloodwork. I don’t know if I’m supposed to just ride it out, beg the cardiologist for an ablation again, or just accept that this might always pop up out of nowhere.

Arabica, Robusta, Liberica, or Excelsa?","Our cafe in San Diego is Exclusive to Excelsa, but I am always curious who, as a Barista, has spoken up to enjoy all four types of coffee beans???

I finished and passed the Masters of Coffee in January 2025, and little was talked about Robusta, Liberica, and Excelsa.  Robusta did have some info, but almost zero questions in the exam were about Robusta/Liberica/Excelsa.

Tens of millions of people have roasted Arabica. Millions of people have roasted Arabica and Robusta. Tens of Thousands have Arabica/Robusta/Liberica OR Arabica/Robusta/Excelsa.

We have roasted all 4, but everyone I have asked over the last five-ish years has really only roasted and served Arabica.  Wine Makers and Servers constantly learn Red, White, Rosé, and Champagne.

**With 100,000,000 Americans drinking at least 1 cup of coffee a day, roughly 99% are drinking just Arabica.  Do we just stay the course or do we commit to a hard fork in the road in 2025 and review these questions as the Barista Coffee Stations Question of 2025?**

The method remains unchanged, because why mess with perfection? Each player is subjected to a rigorous photo-review session, judged on a scale of 1–10 for charm, charisma, and how well they project either *boy-next-door energy* or *suspiciously fatherly vibes*. Additional points may be awarded for personal encounters at Orioles Selfie Day, where hand softness and general huggability are taken very seriously.

What follows are her deeply unscientific, wholly subjective, and entirely entertaining rankings, complete with her unfiltered thoughts, faithfully transcribed by me, your humble scribe and co-conspirator.

Go O's!

**The 2025 Orioles 40-man Roster According to my Wife**

**Gunnar Henderson - 10:** Gunnar's just so... smoking hot. I love him. I wish we could sign him forever. I think he is just... I don't have words for it. He is incredibly attractive. The way he exudes... himself. His demeanor. His serious look. But he's so genuine and friendly and down to earth.

**Adley Rutschman - 9:** I mean... obviously a 9. Adley is really nice, super cute. He completes me... and the team. If Adley left, it would be apocalyptic. He has it all: the looks, the vibes, and he's a good person. I just need someone to inspire me, and it's Adley.

**Jordan Westburg - 8:** I like my westie. He's the bestie. I was sad when he was injured. He's super nice and very cute. And he's only 26? He's great. One of my favorites.

**Dean Kremer - 8:** He's a beautiful human. Probably one of the most beautiful. In person, he feels a little distant... probably because he's so beautiful. It's not his fault, he's just pretty.

**Kyle Bradish - 8:** He's probably one of my favorite pitchers. He seems kind of badass. Super cool... cool little man, cool, cool little man.

**Colton Cowser - 8:** He's cute. He's really good. Cowser brings all the cows to the yard. He's just a great person to have on the team. He has great vibes, and the team is so much better when he's around. That's great for morale.

**Zach Eflin - 7:** Zach! He's very good looking. A very nice guy. Super-duper nice. Charismatic. He has a lot of kids. He's a good dad. Was he good this season?

**Cade Povich - 7:** Oh, he's cute. He seems like he's really young. I think he's good.

**Felix Bautista - 7:** Aww. I give him a 7. He's our gentle giant. He's so active on Instagram. I've met him in person a bunch of times and he's always so gentle with his handshakes. He didn't want to hurt me.

**Tyler Wells - 7:** He's not bad looking, and he's not a rando. He's one of our better pitchers? Oh wow, he's 31? He looks so young.

**Samuel Basallo - 7**: He has a lot of potential. He reminds me of a young Santander. He's a good looking kid. It's exciting that we signed him! Why don't we sign Gunnar? It's nice we'll have him for a long time, so we can see him blossom into a hotter person.

**Jackson Holliday - 7**: He's the best of the Jackson's. He gets more attractive the more you look at him. His demeanor is similar to Gunnar's. Jackson is integral to our team. And he's nice in real life.

**Jorge Mateo - 7:** I always think Jorge has been traded, but then there he is. He's nice. He's an OG.

**Coby Mayo - 7:** I like Coby. He's tall and cute. He's a good guy to have on our team, I think.

**Ryan Mountcastle - 7:** RyRy! We like our RyRy. He's so funny. He's sneaky fast. He's an OG. We like him. He's cute.

**Heston Kjerstad - 7:** \[laughs\] This photo is really not good. But you know what? I love him. I love when he told Volpe to shut the fuck up. I want him back on our team.

**Grant Wolfram - 6:** I don't know him, but he's actually pretty good looking.

**Tomoyuki Sugano - 6:** Sugano signed a baseball for us! That was nice of him. I don't have much to say. He's... not that good. I had high hopes, but...he's nice. His face is nice.

**Jeremiah Jackson - 6:** I actually know his face. He's the skinniest Jackson. I think he's doing well?

**Dylan Beavers - 6:** Beavers... hehe. He has a very interesting look. Very old timey.

**Yennier Cano - 6:** Cano is a 6. He'd be higher if he was better. I don't think he's that good anymore. His face doesn't spark a lot of joy for me.

**Albert Suarez - 6:** I don't feel strongly about him, even though I've met him. I guess he's nice. Big ""Papa Bear"" energy.

**Grayson Rodriguez - 6:** People always get mad when I rank him low... so he gets a 6. He's fine. He's not my type. He's been injured this whole time? Come on - contribute.

**Trevor Rogers - 6:** He's our MVP. So... good for him.

**Tyler O'Neil - 6:** He's not my type. I guess he's not bad?

**Rico Garcia - 5:** He actually looks really nice. Warm. With a good laugh.

**Jose Espada - 5:** This man doesn't exist. I don't believe it. This is a random person wearing an Orioles hat. He's kind of cute, I guess.

**Ryan Noda - 5:** Nooooo... da. He looks friendly. He looks like he could be a hobbit. Not because he's short but because of his face.

**Brandon Young - 5:** Wow that hair. His hair is distracting. He looks jolly. He gets a 5 for his great locks.

**Maverick Handley - 5:** If you squint, he looks almost like that guy who had cancer (Trey Mancini 🥺). Don't write that. He looks nice.

**Daniel Johnson - 5:** I don't know him. Is he a catcher? His eyes sparkle, I guess.

**Alex Jackson - 5:** He's one of the Jackson's. That's what he looks like? Whatever.

**Colin Selby - 5:** Wait, I've seen him already (she thinks this is also Shawn Dubin). That makes me angry. I guess he's not bad looking.

**Keegan Akin - 5:** I dunno. At the moment his face doesn't make me mad. He's got a jolly face. I need more coffee.

**Dietrich Enns - 5:** I don't like the pitchers. I guess he looks like a good guy? But looking at him right now makes me angry.

**Dylan Carlson - 5:** I have no personal connection to this person. He is a rando. He's not a pitcher? Every time I hear his name, I feel like dancing the Carlson.

**Josh Walker - 4:** I have nothing to say about him. I guess his eyes are pretty, but I don't like that jawline. just personal preference.

**Jose Castillo - 4:** I've never seen this man in my entire life. I give him a 4 for being a rando. Wait, his nickname is ""big dude?!"" That's nice.

**Chayce McDermott - 4:** I think I've met him. I'm not a fan of his goatee.

**Carson Ragsdale - 4:** I don't want to rank him. He looks stern. He looks like a coach. I guess he's not bad looking, but he makes me uncomfortable.

**Shawn Dubin - 3:** Dubin? What's a Dubin? Who is this person? Sigh. He's got a great big bushy beard.

**Yaramil Hiraldo - 3:** \[laughs\] What happened to his cheekbones? Who is this??

**Kade Strowd - 3:** Who is he? Strowd? That mustache? I have nothing to say about him. The end.

**Gary Sanchez - 3:** He's a backup catcher? He was a Yankee? For that he gets a 3.

**Luis Vazquez - 2:** I don't like the soul patch.

**Bonus Rankings!**

**Cedric Mullins - 10:** \[cries\] I love him so much. I can't believe he's not on our team. What a tough loss. I've never experienced pain like that. Ceddy... was the team. He felt like our captain, he with us through the good and the bad. He delivered when we needed him. And the stupid Mets didn't even make it to be post season.

**Anthony Santander - 9:** \[sobs\] Man oh Manischewitz. He was my first Orioles love. It's hard to replace him. He was just... such a MAN

**Melanie Newman - 8:** Hot. She's beautiful and has a great smile. Whenever we lose, she does the post-game, and I feel better.

**Brandon Quinones - 8:** Brandon is super cute. I met him! We look good together. He's very friendly. I'm glad he's still with us, even though Tony left.

**Kevin Brown - 7:** I really like Kevin Brown. He's the perfect combination of funny and cute. Perfect voice. Perfect vibes. Please don't leave us, Kevin.

**Mike Elias - 7:** Oh. Haha. I say this every year... but he looks like a rich white man. maybe it's the haircut. I guess he's attractive. he almost hit us with his car once when we were leaving the park. He looked so sad.

**Brandon Hyde - 7:** Noooo I liked him. The team doesn't feel the same without him. I don't really think it was his fault, but I guess he has to take the blame.

**Ryan O'Hearn - 7:** He's just such a great guy. He was so good and it sucked to lose him. This is making me sad.

**Brett Hollander - 6:** Oh, he's pretty nice. Baby face man. I've met him a few times. I feel like he's my friend. Can I give a friend a 6?

**Ben McDonald - 6:** I like him. There's something calming about his voice. He makes you think that everything will be okay.

**Ramon Urias - 6:** Aww. I liked Ramon. What a sad, sad year.

**Tony Mansolino - 6:** I don't know him well. Has he been good? At the start he looked like a deer in headlights. He still does kind of.

**Jim Palmer - 5:** Not my type.

**Takeaways**  
It’s safe to say that in 2025, Gunnar and Adley remain the sun and moon of my wife's Orioles universe: one smoldering, one soul-completing. Westburg, Kremer, and Cowser make up the core of the “cute-and-dependable” tier, while Kyle Bradish has cemented himself as the *cool little man* of her heart.

The middle ranks are a mix of “gentle giants,” “nice dads,” and “rando Jacksons,” proving once again that being tall, approachable, or accidentally looking like a hobbit will reliably earn you a 6 or 7. Meanwhile, Grayson Rodriguez continues his eternal struggle against her indifference, destined to live in the “fine but not my type” zone no matter how many strikeouts he throws.

And of course, the bonus rankings remind us that the real heartbreak isn’t in the bottom of the list. It’s in the empty spots on the roster where Cedric and Santander used to be. Reader beware: these rankings double as a love letter and a therapy session.",19,1759266357.0,orioles,20,0.91,False
1nup8qk,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nup8qk/i_lost_my_alcoholic_mom_and_im_so_angry_about_it/,I lost my alcoholic mom and I’m so angry about it,"I’m 25F and my mom passed away last year. She was young. Way too young. And instead of it being some random tragedy, she drank herself to death.

I tried everything to get her to stop. Begging, supporting, yelling, crying, ultimatums, tough love. Nothing worked. My dad eventually divorced her after giving her the choice, family or drinking. She chose drinking. Refused to admit she had any sort of problem and we were all crazy and overreacting. And that’s what it always came down to. She chose the bottle over her family every single time.

My younger sisters and I found her once throwing up blood, barely clinging to life. She spent weeks in the hospital, and brushed it off as an “allergic reaction”. BS. To this day I don’t know what the doctors told her. She didn’t allow the doctors to tell me anything. But I know it wasn’t good. 
Months after we continued to find wine in shampoo bottles, suitcases, juice/iced tea bottles (my little sister literally drank some once, thinking it was actually tea). And when confronted, she would guilt us and cry.

Eventually, my sisters and I had to step back just to keep our sanity. She would tell her friends about how ungrateful we are and abandoned our mother for absolutely no reason. Even after all of this, we still tried. I wasn’t going to give up on her. 
The last time I saw her, we met up at a coffee shop and begged her to go to rehab. As you could probably guess she wanted none of it. She told us that AA and therapy was enough. 
Meanwhile, I had her location on my phone and watched her lie about going to AA and therapy. She never knew. She would walk up to the building, take a picture of the front door to “prove” to us she went, and drive off. 

And then one day I realized she hadn’t left her house in days. I called for a welfare check, met the cops there, and that was it. She was gone.

And now I’m left angry as hell. Angry that she never loved us more than alcohol. Angry that I had to watch my sisters go through this. Angry that she painted us as villains when we were just kids trying to survive her toxicity. Angry that she’s dead and that this is my reality.

But underneath all the anger is just… grief. I miss my mom. I miss the parts of her that weren’t destroyed by drinking. The mom who was funny, who cared, who was present before addiction took over. I miss having a mom to call, to ask for advice, to be a grandma to my future kids someday. And knowing I’ll never have that, that alcohol stole her from me long before she died, breaks me in ways I can’t put into words.

The world feels darker now. My relationships suffer, my work suffers, and I don’t know if I’ll ever be the same. I just wish things had been different.

1nup8m0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1nup8m0/i_found_the_ai_prompt_that_makes_everything_10x/,I Found the AI prompt that makes everything 10x more interesting,"I accidentally discovered this while trying to make boring work tasks less soul-crushing. These tiny tweaks turn any mundane topic into something you actually want to read:

1. Add *""""What's the hidden story behind...""** 

Suddenly everything has intrigue. 

> ""What's the hidden story behind office coffee machines?"" 

Boom - corporate psychology, addiction economics, social hierarchies.


2. Use **""What would an alien anthropologist notice about...""** 

Gets you that outsider perspective that reveals the weird stuff we ignore. 

> ""What would an alien anthropologist notice about LinkedIn?"" 

Pure comedy gold.


3. Ask *""""What's the conspiracy theory version of...""** 

Not actual conspiracies, but the connecting-dots thinking. 

> ""What's the conspiracy theory version of why meetings exist?"" 

Uncovers power dynamics you never saw.


4. Try *""""How is [boring thing] secretly a survival skill?""** 

Evolution angle makes everything relevant. 

> ""How is small talk secretly a survival skill?"" 

Turns awkward chitchat into advanced social intelligence.


5. Flip to **""What would happen if we took [thing] to its logical extreme?""** 

Pushes ideas to their breaking point. 

> ""What if we took remote work to its logical extreme?"" 

Reveals both possibilities and problems.


6. End with **""What does this reveal about human nature?""** 

The psychology angle that makes everything profound. Every mundane topic becomes a window into who we really are.

The trick works because it hijacks your brain's pattern-seeking mode. Instead of seeing isolated facts, you start seeing systems, stories, and connections everywhere.

Best part: This works on literally anything. Tried it on ""filing taxes"" and got a fascinating breakdown of social contracts, trust systems, and why we collectively agree to this madness.

Secret sauce: Combine multiple angles. 

> ""What's the hidden story behind email signatures? What would an alien anthropologist notice? What does this reveal about human nature?""

Even grocery shopping becomes anthropologically fascinating with these prompts.

What's the most boring topic you've accidentally made interesting?

1nup6ot,https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/1nup6ot/my_experience_and_what_worked/,My experience and what worked,"I always suffered from eczema since I was a kid.  They come and go, usually in small rashes on my legs or arms.   A few months ago, 2 months before my 41st birthday, I had the worst flare up ever.  My whole face was red, itchy, sensitive, burning, and skin was flaking.  It felt raw and prickly and there were nights I couldn't sleep.  It spread to my neck as well.  

I saw a derm who prescribed a topical steroid cream which worked and cleared most of my face.  Then my neck was insanely itchy.  Went back to the derm, was prescribed a body oil only for neck use, not my face.  That helped on and off.  Third prescription was Zoryve, a popular prescription some swear it's like the holy grail.  I was lucky enough to be covered 100% through my insurance and the derm provided a sample for me to use.  Zoryve seemed to working, it was clearing the red coloring on the rashes but skin flaking is still there though minimal.  The skin flakes are now mostly on my forehead.

After a week and half, the Zoryve wasn't working.  Red rashes returns, skin flaking on forehead are getting more.  

Left for a week to California (I'm from FL).  I left all my prescriptions at home so I only had CeraVe lotion/moisturizer and Vaseline.  The rashes, including the skin flakes, were gone by the end of my trip!  The food I was eating was different too.  It was mostly Asian food, like soup noodles, more seafood like fish, vegetables, chicken with rice, etc.  I also drank water constantly during my visit.  It was soo dry where I was!  It was a desert environment, no humidity, all sun. 

Then I came back home and 2 days later... My rashes are back.  I tried online advice, and treat it like it's seb derm.  My routine was:

1. Wash face with water in the am
2. Leave Nidoral dandruff shampoo on rashes on my face for 5 min then rinse off.  I tried alternating with CeraVe dandruff shampoo and the CeraVe shampoo (Zinc) will burn my face so I stopped using it.  I only alternate Nidoral with Neutrogena oil free salicylic acid facewash.
3. Tagrid anti fungal cream (Amazon.  It is non-refundable so beware!) on rashes
4. CeraVe/Nivea moisturizer and Vaseline on rashes.  Moisturizer on other areas with no rashes.
5. Wash face with water at night.
6. Apply DermaZen MTC oil on rashes at night before bed

That seemed to work for about a week.  Sometimes a rash would reappear but the Tagrid cream would get rid of it by morning.  Then after a week or so... Nothing worked.  Rashes are back and plan to stay.  I'm at my wits end at almost 4 months of this nightmare.  The MTC oil didn't stop the itching on my forehead, so I scratched myself in my sleep and I had 4 cysts pimples on my scalp/forehead.  It was VERY painful for days.  Big large pimple that pulled on my scalp, like someone pulling my hair nonstop.  The pain was so bad, even after taking OTC ibuprofens, it was giving me headaches.  Everything was stopped.  

I went to a 2nd derm.  What I thought I had was seb derm, I was wrong.  The doctor confirmed it was eczema.  Plain old eczema.  It is uncommon but you can get it on your face and lots of the symptoms are similar to seb derm.  I was prescribed Tacrolimus and I was approved for Dupixent injections for free by my insurance and Dupixent program.  I used the Tacrolimus which my sister had before for her face eczema which wasn't as bad as mine and it worked for her.

Also note I did have a patch test done for 70 different common allergens and I was negative for all.

Guys, it worked.  It's almost been 2 weeks now.  So here is a summary of my experience and I hope this helps you:

1. I don't have any flakes on my scalp.  This was mainly on my forehead and my face and neck had red rashes.

2. Zoryve is effective.  However, the side effects are not easy to handle.  The migraines are not the same type of pain as normal migraines.  It feels like someone stuck a balloon inside my head and inflate it, and kept inflating it for hours.  The headaches usually subsides after 3-4 hours, but they come back the next day when I reapply the meds. There is also a side effect of UTI.  It is very rare and for some Zoryve cream of a higher concentration.  I had a lower % and I felt my bladder was a little inflamed.  I have a history of UTI so this was a serious concern for me.  If you are prone to UTI, be aware.

3. Compared to Tacrolimus, the side effects are more bearable.  I had itching but it's more intense itching  that goes away if you don't scratch.  The worst side effect is the possibility of skin cancer.  They highly recommend staying away from direct sunlight if you can while on this product.  It is a immunosuppressant.  Another side effect is acne, which did cause a nasty cyst pimple on my face.  The results between this and Zoryve is vastly different, with this cream I saw my old skin coming back.  No skin flaking, no redness, no rash.   Also, I noticed it would also affect other rashes in the body even if you did not directly apply the cream on it

4. Make sure you got properly diagnosed!  Very important.  You could have both seb derm and eczema.  Or you could have only severe eczema.

5. Most healing is done during your sleep.  And it's very slow.  Sometimes you'll see changes in a day or two, for others might not see that for a week.  Some treatments can take weeks.  Tacrolimus can be used up to 6 weeks to see improvement.  Zoryve takes 8 weeks. 

6. Do not use other products.  Less is more.  Drink lots of water and juice with vitamin C.  I also take zinc supplements which is known to help with skin healing.

7. Sunlight (unless you are using Tacrolimus) doesn't help.  It brightens the mood but nope, didn't make a difference

8. I don't notice the difference in the food I eat and how it affected my eczema.  Eating healthy, no matter the reason, should be a priority.  I had cut white sugar/granulated sugar out of my diet, and I use manuka raw honey for my tea and coffee.  Some people say sugar can be a problem for skincare, which I do believe have some truth in it.  I also added more veggies in my diet.  

9. There is no cure for seb derm or eczema.  Just like there is no cure for acne.  We can only live with it and try to understand that it is our bodies trying to protect us, not harm us, even if we lose our quality of life over this.  Treat the symptoms when and if they return.  Pick your battles.  My rashes were cleared... And then 1 or 2 are slowly creeping in, probably because the PanOxyl i used on my pimple which I found I was very allergic too (Yay swollen eyes...).  I am still using Tacrolimus, but cut back to once a day instead of twice a day and only the returning rashes only.  It still works.

10. I think my flare up was a combination of stress (I was about to be laid off, then transferred to a different department with a very busy and difficult workload), life changes (got a new couch which my legs are allergic to! I put couch covers on them and that fixed it), fiancee lost his car and he was in the hospital ER for days, etc... and I was going to be turn 41 soon so hormones may have changed.

11. Birth control pills can make rashes worse.  I used them fine without issues before the flare up.  Now, I can't.

12. Remember... Pick your battles.  There is no cure.  I prioritize what matters more: I wanted to sleep without itching.  After the itching stops, then I focus on the redness, then the flakes, etc... 

Hope this helps someone out there.

1nup6ao,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nup6ao,Monthly Food Expenses for a DINK couple,"I posted a detailed 7 day food journal about 3 months ago, you can check my post history.

This time I decided to post our total food bill for the month and write about some notable food highlights. It's not a diary so hopefully it's ok to post something like this here.

We are a household of 2 adults, 47F and 50M. No kids, no pets. I won't go into too much details but we are comfortably FI and choose to work because both of us have fully remote full time jobs and we both do only 1-3 hours of actual work including meetings per day.

Our daily life is very peaceful and stress free. The rare times I feel stressed is when I lose too many games in pickleball. I enjoy cooking, grocery shopping which I think of as a separate hobby, pickleball, napping, watching anime, and exploring new places to eat with him. We also do a lot of home improvement projects together, which is another significant area of spending. Our newly built house with solar panels is fully paid off. No debts. Our living expenses is pretty low but I am very happy with our quality of life. I am very grateful for our blessings in life, especially for each other. Having a partner whom you know will always have your back, is your best friend, your adventure buddy, pickleball partner and has the same financial values and other important values as you is like winning the lottery.

For this month we spent $508 on grocery and $511 eating out, for a grand total of $1,018.

I think we eat very well and I know our grocery bill is relatively low by American standards. I am a very good shopper, I buy in bulk and buy items on sale. I cook without recipes and can come up with dishes based on what ingredients I have, so I rarely waste food. I consider it my secret skill. I also cook fresh meals every lunch and dinner, we don't like eating leftovers. It takes me about 30 to 45 minutes to finish cooking each meal and do some light cleanup. We use the dishwasher for everything including pots and pans and he wipes things down. I also cook mostly in our backyard so less cleanup to do.

* Monthly Food Expenses
* Groceries - $508 
* Eating out - $511 
* **Total for the month - $1,018**

**Eating Out - $511** 

We usually spend less than $150 per month eating out as I cook almost everyday, but this month is quite unusual as we spent $511. We ate out 6 times and bought some treats to go. We actually had two more meals outside but his parents paid for it once and his sister paid for it once. It's our turn to treat next time.

We splurged on a 8 course chef tasting menu ($268). It was a very memorable experience and the restaurant owners (husband and wife team) came to chat with us in between the courses and brought the chef out to greet us. We felt like VIPs!

I recently discovered an app called ""Too Good To Go (TGTG)"", through which you can buy the leftover food of the day from bakeries and restaurants. I love the thrill of finding a good deal (hard habit to kick from my money saving days) and wanted to try every place that was available close to us. I made 4 TGTG orders this month. My favorite is from a dim sum place from which I got 3 orders of dim sum items for $6. Peets coffee is pretty decent too, 5 pastries for $4. I probably will not do it too often anymore now that I know what it's about and it's definitely not good for our waistlines.

A friend came to visit from out of town and we had dinner at an all you can eat korean bbq. It was delicious and well worth the money at $35/person + tips and tax. We ordered some beer too, so that was a $102 meal for both of us.

An indian pizza place just opened up and they had 50% off on their grand opening day. We ordered Chicken Tikka Pizza and we really enjoyed it ($19.48).

Here are all our eating out items for the month:

* 4 orders of too good to go (bakery treats)
* all you can eat korean bbq and beer
* lunch at a vietnamese restaurant
* boba
* indian pizza and mango lassi
* 8 course chef tasting menu
* 2 outings of sandwich and fries

**Grocery - $508** 

I counted all the credit card grocery store visits and we made 30 visits to the grocery stores this month!

The stores include Safeway, Trader Joes, Costco, Winco, an Asian grocery store and a couple more random stores.

We live within a 10 minute drive to many grocery stores, and most of them are on the way to our pickleball club, which we go to 4-5 times a week. So we will often pick up a few items on the way back home after a pickleball session. I often will make a quick run to Safeway to pick up a few items as it's just a 3 minute drive from our house.

$508 is pretty in line with what we spend each month on grocery. I just checked the freezer and it's packed full of meat. I think our grocery bill next month will be a lot lower.

I've been doing the japanese way of eating since a couple months ago called ""ichiju sansai"", which translates to 1 soup 3 dishes, mostly eaten with rice. Our meals feel so much fancier and it also helps with portion control. We are also eating less meat and more vegetables because of this style of eating. Hot soup helps makes us feel fuller.  We are going to Asia in a few months and I plan to buy lots of pretty Japanese style plates and bowls.",27,1759266159.0,MoneyDiariesACTIVE,4,1.0,False

————————————————————————-

First Half: 

We open with Sonny Alexander getting ready. He puts on his white police uniform(which means he is traffic duty) and rides his bike to his station on the road. There we see him check vehicles coming on the road. He has a conversation with his friend named Daniel who is also in traffic duty. There we learn that Sonny has taken all of his attempts for the UPSC to become a IPS officer and has failed all of them. Daniel tells him “If you had just taken the UPSC exam for DCP instead like your father, then maybe you wouldn’t be here with me”. Sonny pauses for some time before saying “No…it was his dying wish for me to be IPS”. The rest of the scene becomes subtly moody after that. We then cut to a building which is called “Kerala police training program”. There is an assembly taking place there and there is a woman that is speaking. We learn that her name is Elizabeth Fernandas, wife of late DCP Alexander Fernandas. It is his birthday so Elizabeth is taking and praising him to the training officers. She says “The only flaw I could think about him was that he smokes, but beyond that he was a good officer, a good husband, a good father, and a good man all together”. In the same speech, Elizabeth launches a fundraiser for lung cancer awareness in tribute to Alexander, subtly telling the audience that Alexander died due to lung cancer. We then cut to Sonny picking up Elizabeth in his bike and they start to drive. Elizabeth asks him “Is she there yet?” Sonny nods. We see them drive to a courthouse. Sonny and Elizabeth get down and they go inside. Once inside, it is revealed that Sonny is going through a divorce, due to emotional distance after his wife has a miscarriage. Sonny, who is disappointed by this, reluctantly agrees for his wife’s sake. His wife’s name is Lilly. We then cut to a construction site where workers are digging into the ground. One person is digging in a certain area and he sees something and he screams and covers his mouth in shock. The other workers move quickly to him and they are also in shock at what they see. The camera spins to reveal 4 skeletons, two adults, one child, and one toddler. This is huge news and at night reporters are all over the scene trying to get something for a story. They take the bones to a forensic lab but the media follows them. Two senior officers go inside to check it out. One reporter sneaks in beyond the gates in hopes to get something. The two senior officers come out and they start to have a conversation while the reporter starts easedropping . One says “You don’t think that—“ the other responds “I’m thinking the same thing, it all looks to similar. It’s…could very well be Alexander’s only cold case”. The reporter hears this and screams his findings to the other reporters before security detains him for trespassing. This news makes headlines, with every single news outlet reporting about this. This catches the attention of Sonny who remembers how disappointed Alexander was for not being able to solve it. He goes to his station to talk to the commissioner at night. He asks him if he can take up the case saying that he has personal connections to this case due to Alexander, saying that he will definitely solve it: the commissioner basically mocks him, saying “If our own Alexander couldn’t solve it, how can you, his son, who has failed his IPS exam all four times. That too couldn’t even pass the Preliminary, the easiest part of the exam. Anyway, we aren’t going to investigate this. We barely have any leads from Alexander to proceed”. Sonny leaves the station, humiliated by the commissioners harsh words. He also takes it as a challenge to solve the case and prove himself. He calls Daniel and at midnight, where no one else is there, he goes to the crime scene to look around. Sonny spots a pharmacy open and Sonny goes to talk to the owner. He is an old man. Sonny asks him if he remembers seeing anything suspicious between May, 9th 2002 to May 12th 2002, because the case was filed on May 13th 2002. The owner can’t really remember but he does remember that there was a black van parked in front of his store late at night. He told it to move constantly but it only moved after 15 minutes. Sonny looks up and spots a CCTV camera but the owner says “Sorry, I installed that in 2004 so I don’t have footage of the van. In fact, the entire block installed CCTV at the same time as me”. Sonny is now at a roadblock in his investigation. He goes home and decides to resume the case tomorrow evening. However, the next day, the commissioner finds out that Sonny and Daniel snuck into the crime scene last night and suspends them. Daniel is disappointed, however Sonny couldn’t be happier because now he has all day to solve this case. Due to some connections, Sonny is able to get the official case file of the case from 2002, written by Alexander himself. He reads it, and the movie cuts to a flashback of Alexander with his team, trying to solve the case. In the flashback, we learn that the family is the Rajendrans, and that they consist of Rohan, the husband and father, Devi, the wife and mother, Swetha, the child, and Rohit, the toddler. It is revealed that Dayel, the friend of Rohan, was the one who reported the missing case. The whole flashback shows how Alexander and his team tries to solve the case, but due to a lack of leads, they have to close it, even though Alexander tries to talk to them to give her more time. Sonny, after reads it, is frustrated, as this answers none of his questions. Then suddenly, he gets a knock on his door. He opens it and it is revealed to be the commissioner. He slaps him and yells “Did you thinks I wouldn’t find out? I’m a motherfucking commissioner you son of a bitch. Give me the case file”. Sonny goes inside to get it, then the commissioner mumbles under his breath “this guy is trying proving something but looking like a dumabss”. Sonny gets the case file and gives it to the commissioner. The commissioners voice then softens and says “Sonny, I’m doing you a favor. If you keep investigating…unspeakable shit could happen to you. Please stop. Take care of yourself”. The commissioner walks to his bike and drives off. Sonny is taken aback by his words. He is now thinking, what would happen to him if he does keep investigating. He thinks about it for a while and decides that he will keep investigating, just to see if he can move forward with the investigation. The next day, Sonny gets a hotel room near the crime scene. However, the only hotel nearby is an Oyo, and Sonny has no choice but the get that. His room is extremely dirty, and there are some stains on his bed(if you know you know). Throughout the day, Sonny just spends his time around the crime scene. His goal is to make himself look like he is investigating so that he can see what “unspeakable” things might happen to him. Nothing happens to him, and he decides to go back to his room to try again. While he his walking back, a man suddenly walks up behind him and stuffs his head in a bag and others come in and put him in a black van(the same black van that the Pharmacy owner was talking about). We then cut to a small butcher shop where Sonny arms are tied up with blood all over his face. The men who kidnapped him beat him up like he is nothing. Then they stop to actually talk about what they should do with him. Then Sonny spots a sharp object and Sonny crawls over there to cut the ropes to set himself free. One of the men sees this and goes over there to stop him. Just before he can get there, Sonny successfully frees himself and a fight scene commences. Sonny outdoes them despite being outnumbered. At the end of the fight, Sonny throws a small knife to scare one man, however, it lands on his face. Sonny is horrified at this and leans on the wall and slides down. We then get to a flashback with Alexander talking to a 6 year old Sonny while sitting on a home swing and says “My son, I’m sure you have seen those cop movies where the movie celebrates the hero for shooting the hero right?. But that’s wrong, very wrong. Yes even I have shot people to, but only when it was absolutely necessary. I’m telling you this because when you become an IPS, you need to know you limits and morals. Will you listen to your father?”. The young Sonny nods and Alexander pats his head “That’s my boy”. We then cut back to the present Sonny still sitting on the floor. A voiceover says “Your father was the perfect man, now look at you. You’re not even half the man he was”. We then cut to Sonny tying up all the men and then starts questioning them. He holds a machete to make himself look menacing. After many attempts, they open up and say “We are goons for MLA Govindam. We have no idea what this is even about. But we did kill the Rajendrans. All of us, together. But one thing, your father Alexander…he solved this case long back”. We then cut to a montage of Alexander and his team investigating and getting many leads, which is a direct correlation to what the case file says. We then cut to Alexander locking the same men up, but here they look much younger(because it’s 2002). Then Alexander gets a phone call from someone telling to set them free. We then reveal that the person talking is MLA Govindam. Sonny is taken aback by this because Alexander was never the man to bend down to political pressure. So now he is left with the question “Why didn’t Alexander close the case?”.

                              INTERVAL

Second half:

It opens with Sonny and Daniel who pull up to a political assembly where MLA Govindam is making a speech. Sonny and Daniel are wearing a white shirt and white Veshi, matching the crowd around them. Daniel leans in and asks Sonny “Are you sure about this? For all we know they could have been lying to you”. Sonny says “They answered out of fear. You can’t lie when in fear, especially severe fear. I’m certain”. MLA finishes his speech, gets off the stage, and starts to walk to his car. When he is near, Sonny throws a rock into the crowd and it causes chaos. Amongst the chaos, Sonny charges at MLA Govindam and they both get in the backseat of the car. Daniel ties up the drivers hand with a zip-tie and puts him in the passengers seat. Daniel gets in the drivers seat and drives off. Once they have escaped and are on the road, Sonny starts talking. “Govindam, my name is Sonny Alexander. Son of Alexander Fernandas. I have your men in my custody and they have told me everything about what you did. We are now going to an area where we can talk. So until then…don’t say a word”. They drive to a bridge. Sonny, Daniel, and MLA Govindam get down. Sonny  leads MLA Govindam to the railing of the bridge and then threatens to push him off. MLA Govindam starts to scream and beg for mercy. Sonny says “If you don’t answer any of my questions honestly, I will push you. Do I make myself clear?” MLA Govindam says “Yes yes I understand”. Sonny brings him back up and he starts to smooth out his clothes. Then he looks up and smirks at Sonny and says “You’re just a boy. It’s okay I forgive you”. Sonny gets angry and is about the charge at him but then he says “If keep investigating, your entire family name will be ruined”. Sonny calms down and says “I’m not a prick to conform to political threats”. MLA Govindam says “Aiyoo, I’m not gonna lie about anything. I’m only gonna tell the truth”. Sonny looks confused then MLA Govindam says “Sonny, your father, Alexander. He is not the man you thought he was”. Daniel jumps in and says “Sonny, he’s playing some sort of mind games with you don’t give in”. MLA Govindam says “Sonny, you’re not a little kid anymore. You deserve to know the truth. Your father…he was not a honest husband. He was a womanizer, who has slept with many women, and I have evidence”. Sonny is not able to believe this and makes his hand into a fist. MLA Govindam sees this and says “Go investigate Sonny. Once you find out the truth, call me. By then, you would already know what to do to save your families name. Can I go now…traffic officer?” MLA Govindam doesn’t wait for his response and just walks past him. He frees his driver and they both drive off, leaving Sonny stunned. Sonny takes a Uber and goes to Elizabeth’s house. He goes inside and she gives him tea. Sonny starts to talk “Amma, I’m old enough now right…I’m man enough to handle harsh truths—“ Elizabeth looks at him in confusion. Sonny continues “Amma. Is Appa actually the man the world think he is? Was he an honest husband to you?” Elizabeth is shocked and angry at Sonny for asking such a question. She slaps him yelling “How dare you ask that. How dare you. How could you even ask such a thing. Do you know what all your father has done city? For the people? Just because you aren’t like him doesn’t give you any right to bad talk him like that. Get out of my house”. Sonny gets up and leaves. He takes another Uber back to his house. When he gets there, he sees the commissioner again in front of his house gate smoking a cigarette. Sonny gets down and the commissioner moves closer and slaps him and yells “You kidnapped the MLA?” He grabs his collar “What is wrong with you. I told you, you will die if you keep investigating this case”. Sonny tries to explain that there is more to this than just murder but the commissioner interrupts him and says “I know what is going on. I know that Alexander solved the case, and I know that the MLA had some stuff on him which made him back down. I knew…I always knew”. Sonny is taken aback by this revelation. Sonny asks him if he knew if he had an affair or not. The commissioner is taken aback by this and says “I don’t know about all of that, that information, only the head officers know. But one thing…the more you investigate, the more our department will get affected. Do you know just how much influence Govindam has in this city, and our department. Stop. Just stop”. The commissioner backs up, gets in his bike and drives away. Sonny is left there with his words, about how much of an effect Govindam has on the city, and this case. That’s when Sonny starts to think about something. He quickly gets on his bike, and rides to the same Pharmacy that told him about the black van. Sonny demands to the owner that he has to see his CCTV footage. After much pressure, the owner folds. Sonny checks the CCTV and finds the same black van captured on May 9th 2002. The owner told him that the CCTV was installed in 2004. The owner gets emotional and confesses, saying that the MLA made him do it and made him lie to the police. He even gets on his knees and starts apologizing. Sonny is beyond pissed now because he has now truly realized how much impact the MLA has. Sonny helps the owner get up and says it’s not his fault. Sonny leaves and goes to his house. The next day, Sonny goes to the main department office, where a senior police officer that he knows on a personal level due to his father is. He goes to the receptionist there and says that he needs to urgently speak to Officer Durai Lingam. The receptionist tells him to wait and calls a number. After hanging up, the receptionist says that he will see him now. Sonny goes inside and sits in the chair in front of him, saying that he has questions and that he needs answers now. He asks him if Alexander did have an affair. Durai Lingam takes a few deep breaths and drinks some water before conforming that he in fact did have an affair. Sonny is deeply hurt by this, but still tries to stay strong, and asks him if he knows who she was. Durai Lingam says yes, he does know who and that he has pictures. Durai Lingam shows him the pictures but the camera doesn’t show them. Instead it cuts to Sonny throwing up in the bathroom of the station. Sonny rides his bike  to a house and knocks on it. Soon a girl opens but it’s not any girl, it’s Lilly, his ex wife. We then cut to Elizabeth coming down from a Uber and going inside. When she does she sees Sonny, Lilly, and Lilly’s mother Trisha sitting down in the living room. Elizabeth then looks down on the coffee table and sees the pictures. However only the audiences see the back of them. We then cut back to 2002 where Alexander is in MLA Govindams office looking at the pictures. He looks terrified and asks him how did he get them. MLA Govindam says that once he found out that he was taking the case, he asked his team to start digging into his personal life to use for blackmail because he believed that “no man is a perfect man. You can only claim to be one”. Alexander asks him what he wants him to do. MLA Govindam tell him to drop the case, and let his men go, otherwise he will have his team leak the pictures. Alexander agrees. We then cut back to the present where Elizabeth is sitting on the couch next to Sonny, absolutely shook by the pictures. The camera pans to the pictures and it they are Alexander holding hands, hugging, Lillys mom Trisha. Trisha starts to explain that when her husband died, her and Alexander met one day and they fell in love. However with Alexander’s image he didn’t want to get a divorce, so they planned to arrange a marriage between Lilly and Sonny so that they could be together in secret. Elizabeth breaks down there and Sonny tries to calm her down. Sonny takes Elizabeth home and he tucks her to bed. Sonny goes to the bathroom, starts washing his face while crying as well. Late at night, Sonny and is sitting outside at the garden. Soon Elizabeth comes and sits down next to him. She asks him “So what’s your plan?” It then cuts to black. If then cuts Sonny walking into MLA Govindam’s office. He greets him by saying “Thank you my dear boy thank you. I knew you were mature. Here is 5 crores for your troubles”. He gestures to the bag on his desk. Sonny stands there and asks him why he killed the Rajendrans in the first place. MLA Govindam says that “They were slum people . I went there to boost my campaign for the elections. I saw the Rajendrans and noticed there young daughter. Yes she was extremely young but, you should have been there. I had my way with her and…told my men to wipe the family off the face of the earth. Speaking of men, can you release my men please”. Sonny is shocked at this reasoning, but keeps it together, nods, takes the bag and leaves. 2 days later, we are still a MLA Govindams office but everyone is rushing to the front. MLA Govindam comes forward and sees a bag on fire. It’s not just any bag, it’s the same bag that he gave to Sonny. MLA Govindam now has a look on his face in which he realizes that he has been duped. We then cut back to the garden  where Sonny says “We need to make people learn the truth about this city. About how businesses are directly or indirectly being controlled through corruption. We also need to show the world that no man is perfect”. Elizabeth puts her hand on his shoulder and agrees. We then cut to the commissioner reading a file that Sonny himself wrote in disbelief. We then cut to MLA Govindam being arrested. A week passes and Sonny is wearing his white police uniform and then gets a call from the commissioner. He tells Sonny that if he wants, he can him one more attempt at the UPSC exam, if he wants. Sonny considers this and then tells him “See, before I was disappointed. Not for my sake, but for my father’s sake. Now I’m happy, and have accepted my life. So thank you for the offer, but I’ll have to reject it”. Sonny cuts the call and then drives to his station on the road.

Last night, I had my first birthday dinner since I started saying no to the sauce.

I'd been really stressing about it early on in my sobriety, and to varying degrees until last night.

Would I be able to hang tough and not drink? Would I still have fun? Shit, what was I even going to do that would pass as a celebration? I'm sure as hell not sitting home and streaming shows all night. Turning 40 is supposed to be a big deal, right? What if someone wants to buy me a birthday drink?

So, I used my newly found homebody social life to my advantage. I didn't mention my birthday to anyone. My wife and I went for coffee, then took a nice black car to a restaurant we like. I had NA beer with my filet and all was good. She had a diet coke with hers.

No drama. No life-changing revelation. Just a nice dinner out.

I wish I could have pictured that 70-something days ago. All that worry about *not* having a drink by my side came to be no worry at all.

I only need her IF I need her for an hour or 2 to take care of my kids and that is super rare. She likes goong through my personal stuff when I am not home and then questions me about it, ""Where did you buy that perfume?"" She talks about eye lashes and spa treatments and it makes me furious.

She is selfish and always thinks of herself. When I speak to her about my mother in law and if any of it has to to with finances that my husband helps with she becomes jealous like it's hers to decide.

The night before, Ethan had arrived at the parking garage on time, gun in hand, plan set.

It was supposed to be clean. One shot. No witnesses.

Then Keller’s passenger door had opened, and Ethan recognized the man who stepped out. One of Clara Hart’s husband’s men. A fixer.

Not part of the plan.

The moment of hesitation cost him.

Keller turned, eyes widening. He knew Ethan.

Ethan fired. Keller went down—but not out.

The second man shot back. Ethan took cover behind a pillar, returning fire. A bullet grazed his arm—nothing serious, but enough to remind him that this was not how it was supposed to go.

Keller, bleeding but conscious, scrambled into his car. Ethan fired at his tires—one, two shots. The car skidded, slammed into a pillar.

Then sirens.

Time to go.

Ethan drove fast, every nerve buzzing, every instinct screaming at him. He checked the time—eight minutes until pick-up.

The job had gone wrong. Reed was furious. Keller was alive.

But right now, Olivia was all that mattered.

He pulled into a parking space outside the café. He needed a second. Just one second to settle himself before he walked into that schoolyard.

The café door chimed as he stepped inside.

Burnt coffee. Damp coats. The murmur of conversation.

Familiar faces. Clara. Mason. Sarah. Reed.

Ethan didn’t know them yet.

But as he took his coffee and sat down, he couldn’t shake the feeling that something was coming.

That somehow, they were all going to be part of it.

Tell me what you think),"After losing my voice to Vocal Fold Paralysis I finally quit talking and started listening but what I heard was terrifying. 

I won't bore you with all the details of losing my voice, lets just say it was a botched surgery with no real explanation. Now I'm stuck with my thoughts and no immediate way to express them, only pen and paper. 

I guess its best to start from the beginning. I have a very mundane routine I wake up at 6am, jog the same stretch of road, and go to the same coffee shop every morning. I'm a very boring and average man just trying to make ends meet. Everything was normal even after losing my voice up until the man behind the counter of Sam's Coffee, a man I've known and talked to for years spoke in my voice. My heart skipped a beat while a look of confusion slowly grew tighter on my face, I didn't say anything hoping he would speak again and I would be wrong. ""Tim, your coffee?"" My voice echoed through my ears. I grabbed my coffee giving him a look of disbelief unsure what to think or if I was just hearing it wrong. I heard laughter and whispers amongst the fellow shop goers, all of them sounding familiar but not loud enough to completely hear them. I stood outside of Sam's for what felt like forever trying to justify what I heard in attempt to feel better. I finally flagged down a taxi as the fleeting thoughts of Sam's employee left my brain then the cab driver turned around and asked ""Where you headed?"" In my fucking voice. What the hell? Was my only paralyzed thought. Surely this Indian man didn't share the voice of a middle aged white guy. I typed a message on my phone to show him that read ""Pardon me?"" I had go be sure I was hearing this right. ""Where you headed?"" This time he spoke slowly, I wasn't mistaken he definitely spoke in my voice. First the cashier at Sam's now this random taxi driver they both sounded exactly how I used to. Did I miss my voice so much I started hearing strangers speak with it? It was to much for me to wrap my head around so I got out of the cab and began walking home, I was going to call in sick today. 

Shortly after getting home I splashed some water on my face and waited for my wife to get home work and the kids to get home from school. I sat down with a plate of last spaghetti, turned the TV on and flipped through the channels until I saw a news broadcast that said ""Breaking News: Cop shot dead after routine traffic stop."" Before I could react to a cop getting killed I first had to react to the news achor that had my damn voice. I would like to say that was the most disturbing thing but what unsettled me the most was his eyes. They looked just like the guy at Sam's and the taxi driver, black as a starless night sky. Like 2 pools of venom staring into my soul, in the gaze of the news achor I perceived an abyss deeper than the gulfs between stars mesmerizing me, putting me in a trance. Then the language changed from English into some kind of gibberish with the sentences all mixed up. I turned the TV off and began to pace in my living room. I was going crazy I thought, have I gone completely insane after losing my voice. I needed to talk to someone....someone I knew couldn't have my voice....my mother. I picked my phone up and dialed Mom the line rang for a few seconds then went to voicemail, she forwarded my call and sent a text that read ""You ok?"" I told her yeah I just needed to hear her voice cause I was going through some things. Her reply was ominous to say the least ""You sure?"" I didn't know what to think, there's no way my mom could now have my voice as well. I was too much of a coward to have her call, the fear that brewed around formed a disturbing concoction of anger, sadness, and terror. If my mother spoke in my voice it would be too much to deal with. I sent back ""It's ok I'm fine now, just had an anxiety attack."" 

I sat around waiting to find out if I'm crazy or not, my wife and kids would solidify it. Its either I leave and find no answers or I stay and find out when they get home. I laid awake on my bed staring at the ceiling thinking about the guy at Sam's, the taxi driver, and the news anchor. They all had my voice but what was wrong with their eyes? They looked soulless, nobody else looked that way only the ones who spoke to me directly. What could that be? Was my last thought until I finally fell asleep. I woke up to the sweet, thick as honey voice of my wife. ""Hey, baby you ok? You didn't go in today?"" The relief I felt had to be visible. I stood up gave her a hug and kiss on the forehead. Maybe i wasn't going crazy after all, maybe I'm just dealing with the trauma in a traumatic way, which sounds crazy but it's the only thing that made sense. My son ran into the room, before he spoke my heart sank I was afraid he would sound like me but thankfully he didn't he hugged my leg and said ""I love you Daddy!"" Then ran off into the kitchen to get some afternoon snacks. As he ran out of the door I could see his older sister standing there, her eyes....her eyes looked like the deepest depths of the ocean. I jumped back and pointed at her, my wife's sincere look turned to anger as she said ""What are you doing? Whats wrong?"" I frantically searched for my phone to type out a message telling her to look at her eyes. Then she spoke my daughter a 8 year old little girl had my voice....the voice of a grown man. ""Daddy what's wrong?"" My heart began to beat its way out of me as I stared at my daughter in shock. Theres no way im hearing this right, there is no conceivable way to explain this, something is wrong with me.....or something is wrong with them. I looked down knowing I had a horrified expression on my face and walked past my wife, daughter, and son. I went directly out of the house. I was shaken to my core but something told me to turn around. My whole family stood at the doorway talking in unison using my voice ""We love you."" They must of said it 4 times before I started to run down the street. 

I ended up a bus stop, the flickering florescent light along with the cold metal bench and cloudy night didn't make me feel much better but I had to stop, I must've ran for miles letting the darkness consume me and my fear fuel me. I sat alone at the bus stop hoping no one would show up, granted it is 10:30PM so my chances of someone trying to catch a bus this late is slim to none. I had to of fallen asleep either from exhaustion or shear desperation either way I woke up to hear my voice ""Hey mister you need a ride? Its cold out here."" I turned my gaze to see a well dressed man in a pickup truck, I stared for minute then gestured my hand to my mouth letting him know I can't speak. Then he said ""I already know, I'll be using your voice."" Rage and fear sent fire through my veins making me stand up and walk around to the driver side of the truck. I ripped open his door and began to beat this man into a bloody pulp. The back of his head struck off the cement as I slammed my bloodied knuckles into his face, shattering bones. The twitching of muscle and gushing blood strangley made me feel some kind of relief, I wasn't a monster I was just scared. 

I ended up in some small town after leaving the man that took my voice to die on the street and stole his truck. I knew I only made things worse by stealing his truck and leaving him there but what was I supposed to do? Either I'm going crazy and what I did is unjustified or something is tormenting me for some type of satisfaction. 

I slept in his truck for 2 days, staying away from any living soul that sought to destroy me and take what was already wrongfully stolen from me all while trying to use it against me. It wasn't long after that before the cops found me, I knew it would come to this. You can't beat a man to death then steal his truck with no consequences, whether you believe something malevolent is after you or not. There was no point in resisting arrest, its not like I could speak my mind and tell them what happened even if i did they would call me crazy. To my surprise none of the officers used my voice nor did they have the dark clouded eyes. We drove for what I assumed to be about 30 minutes before arriving at a police station. With my hands infront of me still cuffed they allowed me to write down what happened. I gave them all of the information from losing my voice, the guy at Sam's, the taxi driver, and worst of all my daughter. After I told the detectives everything I began to feel a hint of relief like maybe this thing is over, maybe I had to kill one of them for it stop. Its been almost 3 days since anyone has shared my voice or looked at me with dark eyes and ever darker intentions. Why wouldn't there be a reason to believe I defeated it.

A light tap on the door followed by the turning of the door knob the door swung open to reveal a tall dark haired man. 

""Tim Jones?"" He asked 

In my fucking voice!

1nuou6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/uktravel/comments/1nuou6a/reflections_on_three_more_days_in_london/,Reflections on three more days in London,"I'm back. A few weeks ago I spent two days in London and wrote about it. As promised, I made a return trip. Picking hotels didn't quite work as planned, but overall things have been good.

We ended up getting a place in Whitechapel. It's a vibrant and lively part of town, though not one that gets lots of tourists. My gauge for this is how many souvenir shops I see selling double decker bus toys and the like. I seriously do not understand how there are so many of those stores still open. I get that there are the sorts of tourists who need to buy a gift for someone and then buy a stuffed bear with a royal cape, but this feels excessive. 

Likewise, I keep seeing stores advertise ""American candy."" Is this something that's being done for tourists, or for locals or both? It just strikes me as a little odd.

I am also assuming that there is a good logical reason for the large amount of doors with ""fire door, keep closed"" labeled on them in what I assume are older buildings. 

Is Pret A Manger actually good? I see them everywhere. I likewise don't understand how the market can support so many of them. Caffe Nero is also common, but at a reasonable amount. I haven't tried either of them yet. I want an authentic London experience, and that does occasionally mean going to chains to get something familiar or convenient. I just want to focus on the right ones. (Tell me the good chains!)

DAY ONE

After leaving our hotel and dealing with a gray and drizzly London afternoon, we went to do afternoon tea. However, I neglected to get reservations at the place I wanted, and so there was a bit of a wild scramble to find some place nearby the V&A Museum quickly, because people didn't want to be in the wet. 

Afternoon tea is lovely. Of the four types of sandwiches the place I went to offered, I think I preferred the salmon and cream cheese the best, then cucumber and cream cheese (I might just like cream cheese a lot), then coronation chicken, which I'm assuming was a special dish for some royals coronation? Finally, and surprisingly, the egg sandwich. I normally love egg sandwiches, but this may have just been one store doing it poorly. 

Also, I have been under the impression that if you are to order tea, that someone will also provide milk. No milk ever made it to my table, so my poor Earl Grey had to go without because I was too nervous to ask a waiter for milk.

Scones were good as well. I would place the clotted cream on one half of the scone, and the strawberry jam on the other half. I am fairly certain that by admitting this, I have angered someone. 

The little cakes served for the third tier were okay, but afternoon tea is filling and there wasn't enough room for them. 

The V&A is everything you said it would be. It is probably my favorite museum now, edging out the Air and Space Smithsonian. I haven't been to the Louvre yet, so that might change, but this is a hard act to follow. This is definitely the one I will recommend to anyone going to London as a must see. 

We then went to the Royal Albert Hall and the Albert memorial, (Queen Victoria really loved him, huh.) before taking a nice scroll through Hyde Park at sunset. It is an incredibly lovely park. We then took the tube back to the hotel. It's a solid transportation system. The London tube map is a nightmare if you look at all the lines at once, but Citymapper was my savior. Some of the stations are awkwardly shaped, but I'm barely certain that's just how things go when you're trying to attach a modern tube system to centuries old infrastructure.

DAY TWO

Found a lovely place for brunch near the hotel that looked completely playing for the outside, but had an instagram-friendly dining room basement. This part of Whitechapel has a large Muslim community, the sort that I suspect causes people outside of the city to be frightened. But it feels right being a big city and hearing different languages and seeing people from different backgrounds all going to get a coffee or on their way to work. 

I really like London. 

There were a row of street merchants on the way to the station. Selling clothes, Korean style hot dogs, phones, and fresh vegetables. Are there regulations on these sorts of merchants? I was very pleased to see that taxi drivers here had to be licensed. Is there something similar for street vendors?

Crosswalks here threw me off though. I am certain there must be a reason why crosswalks on streets that have dividers are not even with each other, but it is taking getting used to. I am very thankful for the reminders of looking left they're looking right on the ground. I didn't see it once and nearly died. 

Now, on my first post I was rightfully called out for taking my family to tourist traps. This time, we went to Croydon. I don't think we can get as anti-touristy as that while still being technically in London. However, while I am vaguely aware of it's reputation from years of watching BBC comedies, it's not bad. 

Went to Pinball Republic London, which if you like pinball is amazing, and if you don't like pinball, you should try it anyway. They have a ton of games, classic and modern, all in good condition. 

After that, took the tube back to zone 1, grabbed dinner at a pub near the Victoria Palace Theater (a steak and ale pie which was quite good) then watched Hamilton with my family. The irony of going to London to see a play about American History did not escape us. It was a really well done show. 

However, the Victoria Palace Theater does not have a large enough restroom for all of the attendees. This led towards a huge queue that snaked through most of the building. I was rather pleased to be in a proper British queue. People respectfully waited their turn, did their business, washed their hands and left. This process took the entirety of intermission though.

After that, we went to Buckingham Palace. At night. This is probably the best time to go, since there's no one else there. I missed seeing the changing of the guards, but I had seen it at the Tower of London previously, so no big deal.

It really amused me though to realize that for many of you, driving by Parliament or royal facility is just routine the most efficient way to get from point a to point b. 

After that, the rest of my family went home, and because I've been having such a good time, I'm extending my trip solo a few more days. 

DAY THREE 

The morning was mostly busy with transferring hotels. I'm now staying near Kensington. Previously, I mentioned that I wasn't seeing dog walkers or bakeries. That has been fixed. Walking between the two closest tube stations, I found half a dozen bakeries. I grabbed a sausage roll from one that looked appealing, and it was delightful. Still haven't been to Greggs yet, but I have locked past a couple and just didn't have time.

I've also been checking out the local markets. As far as I can tell, M&S is for posh people who don't have time to cook. I still need to visit a Tesco. I am curious about what markets people use. 

Also, if I'm going for an authentic London experience, I do love chocolate and sweets. I bought jelly babies today because I felt obligated to do so after years of watching Doctor Who. But is there a chocolate or sweet that you keep going back to? 

I then went to the British Museum, which is a solid museum, but not as good as the V&A. After that, I walked through Covent Garden and Seven Dials. Had a blast in Forbidden Planet. Then, because I was already there, I waited in line for Dishoom.

I don't get the appeal. It is a solid Indian place, but I don't see what is so special about it that people are lining up to get inside. I really like curry, so before I leave on Saturday I'll probably hit up another Indian place. I feel like I should have a chicken tikka while I'm here. I also need to find a proper chippy. 

My plans for the rest of the week are a little flexible, and recommendations are welcome. I plan on visiting the national science and history museums, catching a Shakespeare show at the Globe, and finding one neighborhood to just wander about for a few hours and see what it's like.

Your suggestions and recommendations have been very helpful to me, and I am falling in love with London. Too expensive to live here, but it's nice to visit.",8,1759265375.0,uktravel,27,0.9,False

I sauna in the am, jiujitsu over lunch, lift at night and hot tub before bed. I have been fasting for 24-36 hours over the last week and I am pretty confident right now with OMAD but want to extend a fast out to a few days or so.

1. Zero calorie MIO with sucralose - will this break a fast?

2. I drink Ryze mushroom coffee in the am, is this enough calories to break a fast?

3. Should I pound protein meals only to amplify ketosis? I have no problem doing this if it’s kicks it in gear more.

4. Are there any premade “snake juice” products out there you would recommend? 

5. Anything else I should know about my routine and how it may affect fasting or how fasting could affect my routine.

6. I am using Fasty (it’s free) are there any other free apps that allow you to plug in workouts to show how it affects the fast?

Who should initiate?,"This Monday I had a date with a guy who I started kind of liking from Instagram. We never talked before, like we never actually exchanged a conversation over IG or any other social media. About Thursday last week he uploaded a picture in a pool where he looked very sexy and I replied to the picture that he looked nice to which he said that I was beautiful. The guy is a model for one of the biggest agencies here so he really stands out.

To that, I thought about telling him if he wanted to come over to my pool and we started texting for a short while and we arranged for monday. We talked about going to the gym and pool to which I didnt think would actually happen haha.

Monday comes and he wanted to come earlier because it was sunny. He arrives at 5pm, we go out for a coffee, talked a lot, he then asks if we should go to the gym around 630. We go to my apartment and we get dressed for the gym. We actually go to the gym, then to the pool then to the sauna. Still no kissing or nothing sexual.

I am quite charismatic and we could build a connection in that time, he opened up quite a bit in the pool and he told me about seeing each other again and such. He complimented my body like 3 times. He even told me he had zero expectations about the date but that I surpassed them all.

We then go back to my apartment and he asks arent you gonna kiss me? To which I immediately kiss him. We kissed for a while, it was already 10 pm and both of us had to start our day early so I offered to give him a ride home. We keep kissing in the car, he told me several times that I was beautiful. When we arrived to his apartment he tells me I am free every afternoon so just tell me when we see each other again. 

Now it’s Wednesday and we barely talked over text. I sent him a funny message about something we discussed on the date testing waters and not much of a conversation occurred so I didn’t propose a new time. I find it strange not to have any text conversation, usually people I am seeing or etc I do text during the day so I find it a little off lol (like he is not interested)

2 days ago we saw each other again. He came have dinner to my house. I was actually waiting for him with something cooked and when I told him what it was he told me he was allergic to one of the ingredients. We ended up ordering food (and he didnt offer to split at all) but we had a nice date. He was really hugging me and we connected quite a bit over that time. We still didnt have any sex, I am not that sure if he turns me on. He has the face of a twink but his body is huge, he is 1.87 meters and I am used to dating twinks but as the night progressed and he opened up I started getting a little bit turnt on.

During the date he told me doesnt like the idea of a daily chat, that he prefers seeing me instead of texting. To which I agree, I dont love texting much but at least a short check in is fine.

As soon as he leaves he sends me a message saying thank you for the amazing night. We chatted a bit and he told me he would have loved to stay at my house to sleep.

At first I was told that I clearly had IC, then I was told maybe it was IC but I also had pelvic floor disorder, then I was told my symptoms were too mild for IC, then I was told I had IC again. It's been a very confusing and frustrating bunch of years but now that they pain has been gone for a long time I'd like to share what helped incase it can help others. 

At first I was told to follow and IC diet and avoid all the foods and drinks that triggered my pain. No spices, citric acid, coffee, soda, etc. That barely helped with the pain but didn't do much for the frequent urination at night. 

I eventually started pelvic floor pysical therapy which helped a little with my pain issues but again was not a cure all.

While addressing other health issues I discovered that I had several vitamin and mineral deficiencies, including low B12, B2 and zinc. I also had B6 toxicity which was discovered by comparing a blood serum test for B6 (pyridoxal phosphate) against an OAT test for Pyridoxal-5-Phosphate (the useable form of B6). I also tested low for healthy lipid levels and was told to supplement with Omega 3 and phosphatidylcholine. Fixing those deficiencies took some time but I noticed that as my other symptoms of illness went away so did my bladder pain. 

However I still had some lingering bladder pain which at this point my doctors were claiming was too mild to be worth doing anything for. But that wasn't a good enough answer for me. Pain means something is wrong so I figured I should look into it more. At this point I ordered a MicrogenDX urine test for myself to see if I had some hidden UTI. I've had several urine cultures in doctors offices and was always told they were clean. But not everything grows in a culture, like anaerobic bacteria. Turns out I had 2 different pathogenic strains show up in my urine. Treating those gave me the last bit of reliefe that I was looking for. I no longer have the pain, burning or urinary frequency. This was about a year ago now. 

I'm not trying to say that IC is nothing more than an infection. I suspect that IC, like many other chronic conditions, is complex and needs complex treatment to fully resolve it. Things like changing your diet or doing bladder instillation therapy may ease pain in the short term but do not address why the pain is there. Doctors don't commonly check for vitamin or mineral deficiencies because those are thought to be super rare unless you are living in extreme poverty. However doctors will also be the first to complain about how unhealthy the average American diet is, so how can they believe both of those things at the same time? In my case I suspect my vitamin and mineral status got bad very slowly over time do to a combination of GI inflammation, extreme stress, and not really liking vegetables. I had to heal my gut in order to start absorbing nutrients well again so it was a long process but it was very worth it. ",6,1759265140.0,Interstitialcystitis,3,0.87,False

It wasn’t expired. I’d been using it, and putting back away in my own cupboard. 


Today, I went in to make food and tea. I have my own pans and a kettle etc. 

She was using a griddle, but had it put over the stove. There is not benefit to doing this, and no problem with putting it over the counter while in use. She has used the griddle many times (mostly) over the counter. 

I realized she hadn’t started yet, and since I was starved, was hoping to make some eggs (on the stove, with my pan). I asked if she was using the griddle, if we could set it on the counter to free up the stove for me. she threw a fits, said it was already hot. I offered to move it. The sides aren’t too hot, but I could use an oven mitt if needed. She threw another fit and physically blocked my attempts to help with her hands, forcing me to wait for god knows how long just to start cooking my food. I have almost no groceries left, so it’s not like I could have just made something else. I have a ton of food allergies, and can’t even drink coffee. The only thing I can make for caffeine is green tea (already drinking water). 

She is like a child. She is selfish. She is immature. She likes to have control over things that only impact me negatively. She doesn’t want to help. Anything that inconveniences me is her favorite. I didn’t give a reaction, just went to my room to wait it out. There is no solution with her childish behavior, and if I have more conflict with her- she escalates and gets my dad involved (when present, which he was). I hate her so much.

1nuoaye,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1nuoaye/hr_sleep_walking/,[HR] Sleep... Walking,"With a jerk Will’s eyes shoot open. With a glance around, a chuckle escaped his lips. Turning around and entering his apartment he was greeted with a question. “Where’d you go so eerily in the morning? What, you got a lady friend I don’t know about?” joked Rick, Will's roommate and best friend. “No no, I just woke up out there.” Will expand getting a sigh from Rick. “You got outside this time, huh next thing you know you're going to be in Africa.”

Walking into the apartment carrying some groceries. He was once again greeted with a question. “Hey, um have you seen Smoky? I can not find her anywhere.” Rick asked, looking under the sink. “No. I was in class all day. Did you check my closet? She has been sleeping in there recently.” Will replied, setting the groceries on the counter. After putting the groceries away, they looked all around the apartment for Smoky, but came up with nothing. “D-do you think... she could have gotten out?” Rick asked with a shaky breath. “No, no she couldn’t have-” Will froze. A panic expression ran down his face. “Do you think she got out while… while I was sleep waking.” A week has passed since Smoky got out. Will and Rick did everything they could. They put up posters, asked the neighbors, and posted it online, but still nothing. Even Though it was Rick’s cat, Will loved her too and has been dying of guilt all week. 

Will once again awoke with a jerk. The first thing he noticed was a floating feeling. When his eyes unblurred he noticed 12 buttons. He comically realized where he was as a ding went off. The door of the elevator slid open to the eleventh floor and an older woman walked in. Will hit the fifth floor and with the request of the woman also hit ground. Lost in thought and the awkwardness of the elevator ride, Will lacked to notice the cut on his nightshirt and other small details like the dirt smell. Once he entered the apartment he followed his normal routine. He brushed his teeth, changed, packed his bag, had breakfast with Rick both trying to make the other feel better about Smoky, and then left for school. With a twenty minute drive and five minute walk Will arrived at his set as usual but his professor wasn’t there yet. Not thinking much of it, Will decided to work on an essay for another class, and it continued like that until fifteen minutes after class should have started when one of the other students packed up their things and left. Some people easily got up and left but like Will some had some hesitancy to leave. But due to the time that was passing Will decided to go to the library due to the quietness and closeness to his next class. Other than his professor not showing up and waking up in the elevator Will continued to have a normal day.

The next day Will had a little worse morning. Like the day before Will awoke in a different place. There was some type of background noise but Will didn’t focus on that but rather constant cold on his face. Regaining his senses he chuckled thinking he made it outside this time. Opening his eyes Will was immediately blinded by bright lights. After taking a minute Will was able to see again and take in his surroundings. A scream left his mouth as he looked over a bridge. Quickly backing up and turning around he was hit with another frite as several cars went by. It took him some time to regain himself again. In a panic Will checked his pockets frantically, and breathed a sigh of relief when he felt his phone. He called Rick and with a panicked explanation Rick was on his way to pick him up. “So where are you?” Rick asked. “Um. I-I don’t know” Will shakily answers. “Hey, hey, calm down, everything is ok. You’re going to take a deep breath ok, then you're going to go into Google Maps and tell me where you are, got it.” Rick farmly started before calmly instructing him. Will did as instructed and in twenty-seven minutes Rick arrived.

When they got home Rick only let Will sit down before starting his interrogation. “How the hell did you sleepwalk 27 minutes away from here?” “By car.” Will added tiredly instead of answering. “By car. What is that like 45 by foot” Rick continued exasperatedly. Seeing that this wasn’t going anywhere or helping Rick calmed down. “Look, *sigh* I didn’t mean to get frustrated, it’s just that I’m worried and I don’t want you to get hurt… You can’t control it and it’s just something we have to live with, so let's just get some more rest. We have an hour and a half left until we gotta get up ok?” Will gave a slow nod, but contrary to his agreement Will couldn't go back to sleep.

The week continued its weirdness as Will appeared miles away twice more and his professor was officially declared missing. The next time Will slept walked he made it twenty-nine minutes away by foot, and the other thirty-three, all in the same direction as the first. Because it was now the weekend along with the fear and panic attacks waking up miles away somewhere randomes brings Will decided to try and not go to sleep. With a lot of coffee and catching up and even getting ahead on some school work he made it Thursday. Watching his friend stumble around Rick decided to end this. “Hey man, I think you need to stop this.” Focusing on keeping his friend steady Rick missed the slight widening of Will’s eyes. “N-no I-I got this.” Will tried to convince him but do to an untimely placed yawned it didn’t work. “Look man, if it makes you feel better I’ll stay up and watch you.” Rick tried to bargain slowly leading him to his bed. “No p-please don’t” Will pleaded once again yawned. Once he made it into bed it was game over and in 2 minutes he was asleep. 

To Rick's surprise it only took 20 minutes for Will to start moving. Seeing Will get out of bed he was about to wake him, but stopped remembering something about waking up sleep walkers and fear and anger. Not thinking about it more favoring watching the weirdly fascinating thing sleepwalking was. As they left the building Rick decided to undermine his best judgment and just followed WIll lead by curiosity and worry for his friend. Rick found himself starting to enjoy the night walk which added to his already clouded judgment. Going for around 2 and a half hours they entered into a forest, and Rick was confused because Will has never made it anywhere close to here. About ten more minutes of walking and Rick was about to call it quits and wake up Will, but spotted a clearing and reluctantly decided to keep going. With only the moon and stars as his light he made it into the clearing. As he took a step forward he felt a chill go up his spine and his heart started to speed up. Making it closer to the center, he noticed some dirt patches, then more and more. He noticed different sizes, some around the size of a skateboard… and some the size of a… human. His heart skipped a beat as he looked up and saw 30 of these patches. He then noticed the lack of another person. Quickly turning around–

Therefore I thought to swap to a Piston machine that should be easier to clean + a better coffee taste (saw a Philips Baristina that looked nice), but I also really like the easiness of an automatic machine. Especially if you need to make 4 coffees if guests arrive in a few minutes.

How is the maintanance of the Rivelia? Do you need to clean it often and is it a hassle? And what to do when descaling is needed?

And anyone that can recommend the Rivelia? Or is there another good coffee machine in the same price range 300-600 eu for Netherlands) that I definitaly should consider?

1nuo9st,https://www.reddit.com/r/auckland/comments/1nuo9st/defamation_by_employers_and_landlords_is_common/,Defamation by employers and landlords is common in New Zealand,"I had an employer nearly 30 years ago in Auckland. He was a good guy. But one of the staff had an accident & he immediately rejected the guy. Overnight from star employee to F off I dont want to know you. I also heard some bad things that he had been involved in hard drugs & another of his favorite employees had done a sexual assault.

At this point I stopped working with them. Over the years I used the boss as a job reference but had pretty much nothing more to do with him apart from exchanging a dozen emails.

I used him as a reference many, many times.

Well a couple of years back I emailed him to catch up and do a couple of weeks work together. We met at Mc Donalds for a coffee.. He sits there not having seen me in over 20 years & says ""You dont fit into normal society. You are insane."" Well nobody has ever said that to me before. It was as rude as hell but also totally left field. I want to make a couple of grand though so I pretended to take it as a joke.

Over the next few days this guy just went from weird to total gonzo. He ended up telling me he had a brain tumor removed 3 years ago and he had severe headaches for 10 years before that.

Considering all of the insults & belittlement i suffered I never want to see the guy again. But if he is saying stuff like that to my face what was he telling all the prospective employers I got to call him?

Another one I worked for I told the guy I needed a filling &had a rotten molar. He decided this meant I was on meth & proceeded to tell people such. I dont even drink beer.

My land lord, I have had a few over the years and only one has done this but she was the most criminal of the lot. I wont state the crimes she was involved in publicly as that will reveal identity. She also was fond of telling people ""stay away from him he is crazy"". Things to that effect. Was this was to stop people from chatting to me about her legal issues.  No she was just a vindictive bitch.

The thing is we should not let people do this. Its a vile and vulgar person that does it exploiting some petty illusion of power.

Its defamation and can be prosecuted.

1nuo9ag,https://www.reddit.com/r/GearShifted/comments/1nuo9ag/explore_the_best_folding_electric_bike_soumye/,Explore the Best Folding Electric Bike Soumye S162 Worth Buying,"The Soumye S162 Black electric scooter caught my eye for its sleek, minimalistic design and promises of reliable performance. I decided to test it out in my daily routine, which often includes commuting, leisure rides in the park, and even the occasional trip to the grocery store. Right from the first ride, it was clear this scooter has a lot to offer, though there are definitely some trade-offs to consider.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The design of the Soumye S162 feels modern yet practical. Its high-carbon steel frame provides a durable and sturdy feel, even for someone close to the 320-pound weight limit. Weighing 66 pounds, it’s a hefty beast, but the folding mechanism makes storage manageable despite the bulk. The adjustable handlebars and non-slip grip add to the comfort factor, accommodating various riding preferences. Though the color options are limited, the sleek black finish is universally appealing. From a design standpoint, it’s clearly built for both utility and style.

**Performance and Riding Experience**  
On the performance side, this scooter doesn’t disappoint in most areas. The 500W motor (peaking at 750W) offers solid acceleration, and I consistently hit the advertised top speed of 20 MPH. The rear suspension system smooths out bumps quite well on city streets, making longer rides surprisingly comfortable. Its ability to conquer slopes with less than a 10-degree incline was a lifesaver in my hilly neighborhood. However, anything steeper left it struggling a bit. 

**Highlights**  
- The detachable seat is a fantastic addition, especially for those who want extra comfort for extended commutes.  
- The wider anti-slip pedal makes standing comfortable, even for people with larger feet (like me).  
- The high-lumen headlamp proved incredibly helpful during late-night coffee runs. It’s bright enough to illuminate the path without blinding other riders or pedestrians.  

[Check Soumye S162 Black price on Amazon.](https://rulse.com/p/b0cv9pxht3/)

**LCD Display and Information Accessibility**  
The LCD display might be one of my favorite features. It shows real-time information like speed, battery level, and distance traveled, which gave me a sense of control over my ride. I found great amusement in tracking my mileage like a sports car owner would. One minor gripe I have is the brightness of the display—it becomes a little hard to read under direct sunlight. On the upside, its functionality adds a cool tech-savvy aspect that I didn’t know I needed in my daily commutes.

**Safety Features**  
Given how often I encounter sudden traffic stops, the dual disk braking system on this electric scooter felt like a blessing. It’s quick to respond and ensures a reliable stop every time, which is reassuring. The rear shock absorbers add another layer of safety by keeping the ride steady, even on slightly rougher terrains. There’s a sense of stability that I’ve come to appreciate with this scooter. The only limitation I noticed was how the braking system occasionally feels too abrupt; you’ll need to get used to feathering the brakes if you're weaving through crowded areas.

**Favorable Attributes**  
- Compact folding design makes it easy to store.  
- Reliable customer service from the LA-based team offers peace of mind.  
- Features like adjustable handlebars and solid alloy wheels make it user-friendly.

**Downsides**  
- At 66 pounds, carrying the scooter up stairs can be exhausting.  
- The solid 10-inch tires are great for durability but lack the cushioned feel of pneumatic ones.  
- The stated range of 35 miles felt optimistic; I got closer to 28 miles on a single charge, though that could be influenced by riding conditions and my own weight.

**Market Rivals**  
When you compare the Soumye S162 Black to other options in its category, a couple of names stand out. The Xiaomi Mi Electric Scooter, for instance, features a slightly lower motor capacity but makes up for it with lighter weight and better portability. It’s also priced a bit lower. On the other hand, the Ninebot Max by Segway provides a larger battery capacity and pneumatic tires for a smoother ride but lacks the detachable seat and falls short on handling inclines. The Soumye S162 bridges the gap between these models, offering a blend of versatility, power, and comfort. However, if compact portability is your priority, this scooter might feel cumbersome.

**Money’s Worth**  
Given the features and performance, I’d say the Soumye electric scooter offers solid value for its price point. It’s not the cheapest option on the market, but you’re getting a versatile, well-built product with advanced features like the LCD display and efficient braking system. For daily commuters or people looking to replace short car trips with an eco-friendlier alternative, this scooter holds up well against competitors in its price range. Still, anyone hesitant to deal with its weight or slightly lower mileage may want to explore alternative models.

1nuo8mo,https://www.reddit.com/r/LaPavoniLovers/comments/1nuo8mo/water_freshness_management/,Water freshness management,"Before I ask the actual question, I wanted to thank everyone here for sharing their knowledge of how to use the lever machines. I only joined the “lever machine owner club” last week and found your tips crucial in arriving at a decent (still a long way to go but already happy with the end result) shot. Thank you!

I was curious how does everyone manage the water freshness in their machines? When I used to live in Asia people there were religious about always using fresh water to make the tea. I learned that with each boil water looses oxygen and the mineral concentration increases. This in theory makes it “less good” (will skip the details here, you can google it) for preparing tea.

Now the boiler in my La Pavoni needs at least 600 ml of water to hit the minimum level required by the manufacturer. I probably use max 100 ml (30 ml for the actual shot plus some group head rinses to warm & clean afterwards). This means I’m left with half liter of water which becomes less and less ideal for coffee extraction every time I top it up a bit and pull a shot. 

How do people manage it? There doesn’t seem to be an easy way to empty the boiler other than tipping the whole heavy-ass machine over and pouring the water off. Do people bother with it at all? Or am I just obsessing over an irrelevant detail? Curious to learn what other people think :-)

Thank you for sharing!

Working my way through [Building Nostr](https://github.com/coracle-social/building-nostr) and came across that quote. I'm curious about how the reputational properties on Nostr could be used to facilitate things like payments and NFT's off-chain. For NFT's specifically, would it be enough to have an event posted by an artist which says ""this thing <image hash> is now owned by <purchaser id> - signed <artist id>"". The classic issue is that an artist could secretly issue many such messages for the same image but is that really a problem? The value would be that an artist has a reputation which people value and they would absolutely loose that rep and destroy the scarcity of their art if they started being sneaky. Also, if I purchased something, I would expect that event signaling my purchase to be shared broadly and immediately. I just wonder if you even really need block chain for that use case, for collectables.

Same with payments in some way, if I want to sell something small, use the coffee example, I think it would be enough for a user to post an ""IOU 500 sats"" maybe with a hash of the payment in the mempool, then they can move along before any confirmations (which is the slow part in bitcoin if I understand this correctly). You could imagine over time it would be possible to programatically determine a 'credit' score based on this history - if you have never used it then you are higher risk, if you have used this and every block you ever referenced in an IOU has been settled, you are low risk, if you have lots of blocks which never made it through because you do something sneaky like submit another block that double spends then you get a high risk.

I love nostr, I think it's very simple and in some ways I think it can help solve some tricky technical problems by making them reputational concerns vs technical concerns.",1,1759263987.0,nostr,0,1.0,False
1nuo6hm,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundTried/comments/1nuo6hm/should_you_get_the_best_appliance_slider_for/,Should You Get the Best Appliance Slider for Kitchen BEZONO,"Testing the BEZONO appliance sliders for a couple of weeks completely redefined the way I organize my kitchen countertop. This simple yet efficient sliding tray immediately became an essential, especially for dealing with heavy kitchen appliances like my trusty espresso machine and stand mixer. The model I tried measures 14 inches by 13 inches, making it roomy enough for even the larger items on my counter without making it look cluttered. Boasting silent rubber wheels and a clear acrylic design, this nifty tool appears as handy as it is visually appealing.

**Design and Materials**

One of the first things I noticed was the premium construction. The BEZONO appliance sliders are made from transparent acrylic, which is not only modern and sleek but also durable enough to handle everyday use. Every time I moved my coffee maker across the countertop, I couldn't help but appreciate the near-silent glide provided by the rubber wheels. Not only does this minimize noise early in the mornings, but it also gives me peace of mind that my countertops won’t get scratched. The clear acrylic material blends effortlessly into various kitchen aesthetics without looking obtrusive. 

[Check BEZONO B0DMVN3SDY price on Amazon.](https://gogeary.com/p/b0dmvn3sdy/)

**Everyday Utility**

Convenience shines through with this product. Navigating my espresso machine out of the tight corner under the cabinets has been a constant hassle, but the sliding tray makes it so much smoother. Steam damage was a concern when I used to refill the tank directly beneath the cabinets, but now I just glide it out, complete the task, and neatly slide it back. This has undoubtedly prolonged the life of both my appliance and the cabinetry. Plus, the tray accommodates various appliance weights, from coffee machines to heavy-duty kitchen mixers, without wobbling or feeling unstable.

**Ergonomic Features**

The thoughtful design extends beyond functionality. The pull handle provides a solid and comfortable grip, making even heavier appliances easy to maneuver. A hidden gem of this slider is the integrated cable organizer. If you're anything like me, tangled cords drive you insane. This little feature ensures everything stays tidy and organized, which may seem like a minor point but goes a long way in streamlining the workspace.

**Highlights**

- Smooth, silent sliding thanks to premium rubber wheels  
- Durable, clear acrylic design that complements any kitchen aesthetic  
- Wide applicability for coffee makers, mixers, and other kitchen appliances  
- Ergonomic pull handle for easy handling  
- Built-in cable organizer for cord management  

**Room for Improvement**

No product is without its quirks, and this one isn’t an exception. For instance, I think the sliding tray could benefit from some form of adjustable strap or fixture to secure appliances during movement. While the surface is grippy enough for casual use, heavier machines could shift if you're not paying attention. Additionally, though the acrylic is aesthetically pleasing, smudges are very visible, requiring regular cleaning to maintain its sleek look. It's not a deal-breaker but something to consider, especially if you're a stickler for spotless surfaces.

**Areas of Concern**

- Visible smudges on the acrylic after regular use  
- A more secure fixture for heavier appliances would be a welcome addition  

**Peer Products**

Compared to sliders like the Nifty Under Coffee Pot Slider Drawer or Kitchen Spaces Sliding Tray, this product stands out for its build quality and noise-free operation. While other options may prioritize affordability over design, they often lack the sturdy wheels or transparent aesthetics seen here. The BEZONO model also edges ahead with its integrated cable organizer, which isn’t as common in competing brands. That said, some competitors do offer sliders with deeper tray designs, preventing appliances from moving altogether—a feature this product could consider adopting.

**Budget-Friendly**

Although I was initially on the fence about whether it would be worth spending on a sliding tray, this product proved itself. For the features and utility it offers, the balance between cost and function felt just right. You could spend less on flimsier designs, but those often lack the silent wheels or stylish appearance that this tray brings to the table. For those with multiple countertop appliances, this investment quickly pays off in terms of convenience and protection for your appliances and counters.

I invited a bunch of people, made it clear it was casual/no-pressure, and couple of friends joined for the full day while others popped in for parts.

During the day:

* I bought coffee and lunch for the group of walkers, which I genuinely insisted on doing- especially since a few of these friends committed to the full walk and I wanted to show my appreciation.
* Later, my husband picked up a tab for drinks for \~8 people (\~$300). No one offered to chip in, and while that felt odd, we shrugged it off because my husband was happy to step in and contribute to his own wife's birthday celebration.
* At the next stop (drinks + snacks, \~$170), again no one offered when the bill came out, and I paid.
* At dinner (5 of us, \~$200), one friend ordered dishes for the table to share, but when the bill came, everyone kind of just sat back and I paid.

There were a couple half-hearted “just Venmo us” comments, but no one has followed through, and I feel awkward about sending requests. To me, it feels weird and tacky to chase people down like a bill collector when basic courtesy would’ve been to at least offer in the moment or proactively send something afterward, even if it's not the exact amount.

Altogether my husband and I spent just over $700.

I’ve always assumed at birthday outings, friends at least pay their own way (and usually chip in for the birthday person), not the other way around. I never expect the birthday person to cover everything. But now I’m wondering if I'm misunderstanding the etiquette.

To add to the awkwardness, I have dinner this week with a group friends (a couple of whom were a part of the festivities this weekend) and I already anticipate that we’ll split the bill evenly, which feels ironic, given the situation above.

AITA for feeling resentful about covering all these costs? Should I just accept that hosting a birthday means you pay, or was it bad form for my friends not to offer? Did my husband and I set the tone early on by covering a couple of the tabs? I'm also open to perspectives from the other side- I really love these friends, and I think playing devil’s advocate might help me feel less annoyed and learn how to handle this better next time!",14,1759263445.0,AITAH,34,0.82,False

Using the Savogran 12oz Oxalic Acid Wood Bleach has been an intriguing experience. This wood bleach, a product manufactured in the United States, claims to effectively bleach unfinished or stripped wood while being easy to mix and use. I've had the chance to test this product in a variety of household cleaning and restoration scenarios, and while it delivered on many promises, there are a few considerations worth discussing.

**Design and Packaging**

The straightforward design of this wood bleach packaging serves its purpose well. The 12oz container is lightweight and easy to store, fitting conveniently on a shelf or in a toolbox. Instructions are printed clearly on the bottle, which a friend of mine—who usually struggles with chemical products—noticed immediately and appreciated. There’s nothing overly fancy here, but it gets the job done. The solid packaging ensures no accidental spills, which is a relief when dealing with potent chemicals.

**Ease of Use**

Mixing the concentrate with hot water turned out to be surprisingly effortless. I used a basic mixing bin and followed the ratio specified on the packaging. The mix dissolved evenly without excessive stirring, and the solution's clarity made it easy to use on different wood surfaces. My neighbor even borrowed it to tackle her stained coffee table, and the solution worked as advertised. However, it did take some trial and error to find the right application technique. I recommend wearing gloves and using a soft-bristled brush for even coverage.

**Performance on Wood Surfaces**

This wood bleach delivered solid results on unfinished and stripped wood surfaces. My old, weathered patio table had dark spots and water stains that seemed almost impossible to remove. After applying the solution, the spots lightened significantly, and the original color of the wood returned closer to its natural hue. However, the product struggled slightly on heavily aged wood. A colleague tested it on a decades-old doorframe, and while there was improvement, the deepest stains stubbornly lingered. For light to moderate stains, this seems to be a very effective solution.

**Highlights**

- Quick and effective on most unfinished wood surfaces  
- Easy-to-use concentrate that mixes seamlessly with water  
- Suitable for household or professional use  
- Conveniently manufactured in the USA  

**Shortcomings**

- Not as effective on deeply aged wood or extremely tough stains  
- Requires protective gear, such as gloves and goggles, due to potency  
- Can be time-consuming to apply evenly on large surfaces  

**Safety Considerations**

Given the strength of the oxalic acid in this solution, safety should not be overlooked. Always wear gloves, and I'd suggest eye protection, too, especially for first-time users who aren't used to working with more caustic solutions. Despite taking precautions, one of my clumsy moments resulted in a few drops splashing onto exposed skin. It stung a bit, so rinsing immediately with cold water is crucial if that happens. My coworker told me he had a similar experience but luckily didn't see lasting irritation. Respect the chemical, and it’ll respect your space.

**Competing Products**

Compared to other wood bleaches available, such as one from a well-known brand that combines multiple bleaching agents, this product feels more straightforward yet less versatile. The Savogran bleach focuses solely on oxalic acid, giving it a niche edge for certain applications. However, a competitive product I tested previously worked equally well on fabric stains, offering a bit more flexibility. The one downside to multi-purpose bleaches is their strength can feel reduced compared to focused products like this one. If your needs are strictly wood-related, you might prefer the effectiveness of this solution, although I think it would be nice if it excelled across a greater number of materials.

**True Value**

For the average DIY enthusiast or professional woodworker, this product feels justified in its price placement. The concentrate stretches a long way—one 12oz bottle treated several large surfaces during my testing, and there was still enough left for another small project. Considering the results it brought on moderately stained wood, I believe this offers a reasonable balance of effectiveness and affordability. But if you're looking for a bleaching agent with universal applications, this might not fulfill every need.

1nunvmi,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoldenCO/comments/1nunvmi/my_review_of_golden_co/,"My review of - Golden, CO","*I had a lovely visit to Golden recently and was inspired. Take this as a lighthearted review, it is not intended to make anyone crabby.*

Stay Golden, that’s what the shirts say. There is no finishing touch of a restaurant named Ponyboy’s, unless I missed it. It doesn’t matter, everyone is walking their dachsunds and drinking oat milk lattes and carefully positioning their felt hats. They are Goldenaires. 

Goldenaires seem to like being outside. Or maybe they are mostly unemployed. At 2 on a Thursday the greenway is packed. They also like to drink, so ditto for the bars.

Goldenaires walk as if they are watching a video of themselves walking, or a video of happy people much like themselves walking. They seem very conscious of themselves. Mirrored sunglasses beam twin glints around a crowd of carefully disheveled heads. They slow when passing a window and use selfie sticks (still!) unironically. The weather is lovely, perfectly unmentionable, but the people will comment on it, LA phrasing unable to resist the rural lure of the topic. 

The Goldenaires are probably high. Not just because you are at 5280 feet but because somehow Red-state Colorado has an extensive roster of legal weed dispensaries. These are all too antiseptic and businessey. You’ll wish for a beaded curtain and dreadlocked, braless girls swaying to GriZ (or at least Dave Matthews) but instead your ID is examined by a pierced 23 year old who looks like the kid that always showed up late for Econ and asked for your notes at the end of the semester. They’ll be more thorough than any TSA agent, and you’ll be let through the door of a budget dental clinic into a room where cases hold packages that would make your cousin the graphic designer cry (mostly) or are dupes of your favorite supermarket snacks. Canned, nested weed potato chips called Mingles sit next to DoobieMint gum. Is this a joke? Who cares.

Dachshunds are everywhere. Goldenaires love them. Why? These dogs get lost in an un-mowed yard. Why would someone who lives in Colorado, a notoriously snowy state even with our current global hot flash, want a dog with 4-inch legs? Is this a joke? Again, no one cares. If the Goldenaire isn’t walking a dachshund, they are casually holding the leash of a direwolf. Too casually. That thing weighs 250 lbs and is staring you in the eye. Why do they have it on a 1/2 inch artisanal leather strap?  Again, no one cares. The restaurants have dog items on their menus, often listed above the kid items. 

Goldenaires love techy-looking outdoor gear that either came from a sale rack at Cabellas or costs $1500. Chunky sweaters and felt hats are worn with multicolored hiking leggings, toe shoes and a crossbody bag made from 15 different prints. They look like an REI catalog or a very happy Free People ad campaign. Unless they don’t, then they are wearing a tiny tank top and a swirly purple skirt and stacked toe rings and a throat tattoo. Butterflies seem popular. 

Goldenaires seem to have some kind of WPA for white guys with guitars and an extensive knowledge of the last 50 years of indie rock radio. Every brewpub, coffee shop, bike store and taco food truck has a tiny stage, placed inconveniently where you have to trip over it to pick up your vegan chilaquelles or bison empanadas. On this awkward platform a dude will alternate songs by the Cure and the Eagles with “another original song” about his breakup and his cat. Pass the Mingles and let me pet your direwolf, I’m staying. ",0,1759263224.0,GoldenCO,42,0.25,False
1nunuul,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Intelligent_Art4349/comments/1nunuul/starbucks_coffee_tasting/,Starbucks coffee tasting,Hi guys I have a question about the Starbucks coffee tasting. I’m Starbucks partner and I’ve been worked there for 3months now. This morning my partner warned me about the coffee tasting that is don’t have coffee tasting more than once. It was so loud in the store so I couldn’t hear it clearly but she said the food that I’m taking while I’m doing the coffee tasting they’ll gonna put on the document and I might catch up. But obviously I didn’t know that and every weekend I’m having an opening shift so same supervisor keep saying ‘let’s do the coffee tasting’ so I did with my supervisor and one other partner. Is there anyone who can explain about the coffee tasting and why she said be careful not to have too much coffee tasting??
