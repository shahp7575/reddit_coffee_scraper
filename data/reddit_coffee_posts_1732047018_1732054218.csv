They don't ban creepy men who stalk underage employees because they need the business so any time one of our regular creeps come through the girls have to hide in the bathroom until they leave. My own manager had a stalker and she would feed into it, she would accept gifts, talk to him for long periods of time while the rest of her staff is dealing with a triple stacked line. Then as soon as he would leave she would freak out and have to take a moment in the bathroom to calm down before she could hop on and help her team. Then she would get sassy with us for having bad drive times and basically degrade us for it. 

Also, your husband is probably hooking up with a barista too, my manager had multiple married men's contact info and would get in their cars when they would come through. and she's not the only girl who does this. My operator would give alcohol to minors and my general manager had a statutory rape allegation with one of the baristas. 

all the customers, including some of yall in this subreddit, as well as management are brainwashed beyond belief. YOU SHOULD NOT BE SPENDING $30 A DAY ON COFFEE BECAUSE YOU COME BY 3 TIMES A DAY TO CHAT. A lot of the people who work at Dutch bros are cool people i get it we are fun to talk to, but save your money. all the merch we give out is so silly and it just a money grab for something you will lose. and not care about in a week. I get it some people collect but maybe look into what you're supporting when you collect. 

This was the worst job I've worked in my whole life and i worked a job where my manager was selling drugs out the back of and coming to work high.

**Chapter 1: The Calm Before the Storm**

It started as a collective sigh of relief in the United States. The economy had bounced back after years of sluggish growth and uncertainty. Employment was at an all-time high, the stock market had rebounded, and the general mood of the nation seemed to buzz with unshakable optimism. The struggles of the past decade were fading into distant memories, replaced by the comforting hum of modern life.

Life in the cities was relentless and exhilarating. Crowds filled coffee shops each morning, where steaming cups of artisanal brews and the whirring of espresso machines fueled the day’s ambitions. Gyms were packed with people sweating through high-intensity interval training, sculpting bodies as much as feeding egos. Airports thrummed with activity as families, business travelers, and wanderlust-struck millennials packed gates in anticipation of their next destination. The scent of jet fuel mingled with overpriced perfume and the occasional cry of an overtired child.

For many, life had become a routine of striving, consuming, and progressing. Dinner reservations were made weeks in advance, yoga classes were scheduled between meetings, and weekends were consumed by brunches and errands. The news cycles flashed ominous headlines—climate crises, international conflicts, political scandals—but these were background noise. Few paused long enough to consider their personal vulnerability. Who had the time?

This was America’s collective mindset: life was good, perhaps even invincible. People chased ambitions as though tomorrow promised only more success, more prosperity. The concept of catastrophe, of anything that could derail the momentum, seemed like something reserved for distant parts of the globe or the dusty pages of history.

While people reveled in their routines, somewhere in the crowded hospitals, hidden among reports of seasonal flu cases and minor outbreaks of strep throat, whispers of an unusual illness began to emerge. It wasn’t dramatic enough to warrant a special news segment or emergency press conference—just a smattering of odd cases that healthcare workers attributed to the usual winter viruses.

The illness was unremarkable in its initial presentation. Mild cold-like symptoms, if any. Doctors called it “a seasonal bug,” perhaps an underestimated strain of the flu. Patients recovered quickly, or so it seemed. It was an illness without a face, a mystery that didn’t warrant fear. There were no feverish hospital admissions, no spikes in mortality, and no alarms.

Yet, the virus—soon to be named the Thanatos virus—had a silent, sinister edge. It moved quietly, asymptomatically through communities, bypassing even the most diligent health screenings. Unlike its predecessors, it did not announce itself with severe symptoms. Instead, it lingered, dormant, until its devastating effects could no longer be ignored.

Across town hall meetings and television interviews, experts dismissed early concerns about the virus. “We’ve dealt with worse,” they assured. “Modern medicine has advanced far beyond anything like this.” Journalists asked a question or two, but the story was buried under headlines about new technological breakthroughs and a highly publicized celebrity scandal.

Even for those who had heard the name Thanatos, the implications were lost in translation. After all, the public had weathered a litany of diseases over the years: SARS, Zika, and even the more recent H5N1 outbreak. None had truly upended life in the way apocalyptic films and books always imagined. It was easier, safer, to believe this time would be no different.

For Dr. Eliza Cohen, an epidemiologist at a major urban hospital, this complacency was deeply unsettling. By the time the first medical reports from Europe and Asia began to surface, the virus had already taken hold in more places than anyone realized. Eliza sat in her office, staring at the latest data. The patterns emerging from these reports unnerved her. The virus was highly transmissible, with an unusually long incubation period. It spread easily between asymptomatic carriers, meaning there was virtually no way to track it.

Eliza typed up her findings in an urgent email to her department, her fingers trembling slightly as she hit send. She imagined her colleagues rolling their eyes as they skimmed her warnings. After all, no one was talking about this virus—not the CDC, not the media, not even her hospital’s infectious disease department.

“This isn’t hysteria,” she muttered to herself, a phrase she would repeat often in the coming weeks. “This is a warning.”

The United States wasn’t the only country too busy to notice the quiet storm brewing. Around the globe, societies thrived on a similar tempo. Skyscrapers rose against urban skylines, markets hummed with activity, and millions of people traveled across borders daily. The interconnectedness of the modern world was humanity’s greatest strength—and its fatal weakness.

In bustling cities like Tokyo, Paris, and São Paulo, the virus found fertile ground. Public transportation systems teeming with passengers, offices crowded with workers, and schools filled with students provided the perfect breeding grounds. Each handshake, shared elevator ride, or exchanged pen carried the virus invisibly to its next host.

Even as faint warnings began to ripple through the medical community, world leaders remained focused on other priorities. Trade negotiations, military alliances, and domestic policy battles consumed the bandwidth of governments. There was simply no room on the agenda for what seemed like a benign, irrelevant issue.

Weeks passed, and the virus continued its quiet march. Thanatos moved with terrifying efficiency, slipping unnoticed into the bloodstream of societies around the globe. By the time healthcare systems began to recognize its presence, it was far too late.

In Chicago, an elementary school teacher brushed off her fatigue as the result of long hours and caffeine withdrawal. In Rome, a bus driver attributed his occasional headaches to stress. In Beijing, a retiree chalked up his mild cough to the season’s poor air quality. None of them knew that they were carrying the virus, spreading it unknowingly with every touch, every word.

Eliza Cohen watched the data roll in, the number of cases rising incrementally yet steadily. She sat in her office late into the night, pouring over maps that showed clusters of infections in major cities across the globe. It wasn’t explosive—yet. But Eliza knew enough about epidemiology to understand the gravity of exponential growth.

“Why isn’t anyone listening?” she whispered into the silence.

In suburban neighborhoods, where manicured lawns stretched in neat rows and families gathered for weekend barbecues, the concept of an invisible threat was unimaginable. Life went on with cheerful oblivion. Parents shuttled children to soccer games, couples planned destination weddings, and college students prepared for spring break trips. There were no masks, no hand sanitizer shortages, no social distancing.

When a colleague casually mentioned the virus at a dinner party, most brushed it off. “Didn’t we just go through this with swine flu?” one guest scoffed, sipping a glass of wine. “It’s all media hype. They’re just trying to scare people.”

Denial was easy. It was comfortable. It allowed people to remain in their bubbles of normalcy, free from the weight of what might come next.

It wasn’t until a small hospital in Seattle reported its first Thanatos-related death that the whispers became harder to ignore. A middle-aged man had been admitted for what appeared to be a severe respiratory infection, but his symptoms escalated rapidly. Within hours, his body had succumbed to a catastrophic immune response. Doctors were baffled; the virus behaved unlike anything they had seen before.

The case made local headlines, but it was quickly buried under news about a celebrity scandal and a high-profile political debate. Only a handful of people paid attention, among them Eliza Cohen. She clipped the article, added it to her growing folder of data, and prepared for the inevitable.

For Eliza, the writing on the wall was clear. The virus was no longer content to linger unnoticed. Its dormancy was ending, and the storm it promised would be catastrophic.

In the days that followed, more deaths were reported. They came sporadically at first—a case in New York, another in Los Angeles—but they were enough to catch the attention of local health departments. The CDC issued its first advisory about Thanatos, urging hospitals to monitor for symptoms and report unusual cases.

Still, life continued. The economy churned forward. People crowded into concerts, packed sports arenas, and boarded planes for vacations. The virus had yet to infiltrate the collective consciousness. For most, it was a faraway problem, something that happened to other people in other places.

But for Eliza and the small group of medical professionals who understood the stakes, every passing day felt like another step closer to disaster.

The calm before the storm was ending. The world just didn’t know it yet.

In Washington, D.C., the mood in the corridors of power was one of cautious optimism. Economic advisors delivered glowing reports, citing rising consumer confidence and lower unemployment rates as proof of a thriving nation. Lawmakers debated bills meant to solidify these gains, focusing on tax reform, healthcare improvements, and infrastructure upgrades.

Behind the scenes, a few senior officials in public health circles began voicing concerns about the newly emerging virus. Internal memos circulated quietly through agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). But these concerns were drowned out by the broader focus on economic growth and political posturing.

“Are we seriously worried about this?” one senator scoffed during a private briefing with a CDC representative. “We’re talking about a handful of deaths, and you’re suggesting we divert resources from the budget for this?”

The official nodded reluctantly. The senator’s reaction was typical—a predictable dismissal of a threat that wasn’t yet tangible. To challenge it further risked being labeled alarmist, or worse, politically naïve.

For every epidemiologist sounding an alarm, there were ten skeptics, each pointing to the lack of immediate evidence. “We can’t panic every time a new bug shows up,” became the unofficial mantra in both political and public spheres. Modern medicine was the armor they clung to, and no one was eager to admit that armor might have chinks.

While major cities hummed with activity, the Thanatos virus was quietly infiltrating small towns and rural communities. In places like Pinewood, Kansas, and Harperville, Ohio, life was deceptively simple. Children played on tree-lined streets, and families gathered for Friday night football games. Here, the virus wasn’t even a rumor yet.

On a chilly March evening in Pinewood, 34-year-old Sarah Jenkins felt a nagging headache as she prepared dinner for her family. She dismissed it as a symptom of her busy day—balancing her teaching job with raising two young boys. The next morning, her symptoms were gone, and she went about her day as usual, hugging students, chatting with neighbors, and sharing coffee with a friend.

Unbeknownst to Sarah, she had already contracted the virus. Her brief headache and fatigue were its only visible signs before she became a silent carrier. Within days, the virus began to spread through her community, hopping from person to person as effortlessly as a breeze.

The local clinic in Harperville saw an uptick in patients with vague symptoms—mild coughs, unexplained fatigue, and minor fevers. Dr. Alan Monroe, a general practitioner, noticed the pattern but didn’t think much of it. After all, cold and flu season wasn’t officially over, and people often overreacted to minor illnesses.

But Thanatos wasn’t like other viruses. By the time Dr. Monroe ordered his first test, the virus had already moved on, carried by travelers heading to larger cities or visiting relatives out of state. The false calm in these small towns would soon shatter, but for now, ignorance was bliss.

In her office at St. Mary’s Medical Center, Dr. Eliza Cohen stared at her laptop screen in frustration. She had spent weeks compiling data, cross-referencing reports, and submitting her findings to colleagues and government agencies. Yet, every attempt to sound the alarm was met with polite indifference.

She glanced at the clock on her desk. It was nearly midnight, and her inbox was overflowing with automated replies and vague acknowledgments from public health officials. She scrolled through the emails, pausing at one from the CDC’s regional director. The tone was courteous but dismissive:

*Dr. Cohen,*  
*We appreciate your diligence in monitoring emerging patterns. At this time, the CDC is conducting its own investigation and has found no evidence to support heightened concern regarding the Thanatos virus. Please continue to monitor and report unusual cases as necessary.*

Eliza leaned back in her chair, rubbing her temples. The numbers didn’t lie. The virus was spreading at a rate far faster than seasonal flu, and the delayed onset of symptoms meant it was likely already everywhere. What frustrated her most was the lack of urgency. She understood the need for caution and verification, but in this case, caution felt like negligence.

She opened a blank document and began drafting another report, this time addressed to several prominent epidemiologists she had worked with in the past. If the institutions wouldn’t act, perhaps the individuals within them would.

Her fingers flew across the keyboard as she wrote:

*“Colleagues,*  
*I am writing to express my growing concern about the Thanatos virus. The data suggests a pattern of asymptomatic transmission followed by a sudden, severe onset of symptoms in a small but increasing number of cases. The global distribution of these cases indicates widespread community transmission. I urge you to review the attached data and consider advocating for preemptive measures…”*

As Eliza worked late into the night, the world outside continued its relentless pace, oblivious to the storm brewing beneath the surface.

The tipping point came not from a crowded subway or a bustling airport but from a seemingly innocuous corporate retreat. Held at a luxury resort in Denver, the retreat brought together over 500 executives and employees from across the country. For three days, attendees mingled during workshops, shared meals at long banquet tables, and gathered for team-building exercises.

Among them was an unassuming man named Greg Thompson, a mid-level manager from Seattle. Greg felt perfectly healthy when he arrived, aside from some mild fatigue he attributed to jet lag. He shook hands with colleagues, gave presentations, and even joined a group for a late-night karaoke session at the hotel bar.

Greg didn’t know it, but he was carrying the Thanatos virus. By the end of the retreat, dozens of attendees had been exposed, many of whom would board planes and return to their home cities. Within weeks, contact tracers would link Greg’s case to outbreaks in at least 12 states, but by then, the virus would have spread too far to contain.

As the number of cases began to climb, cracks in the healthcare system became glaringly obvious. Hospitals were already operating near capacity, and staff shortages plagued both urban and rural facilities. Supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE), which had been stockpiled during previous outbreaks, were outdated or insufficient.

When patients began arriving with severe symptoms, many doctors and nurses were caught off guard. Initial treatments mirrored those for severe respiratory infections, but Thanatos defied the usual protocols. Ventilators helped some patients, but others deteriorated rapidly despite the best efforts of medical teams. The virus triggered a cascade of complications, from organ failure to sudden cardiac events, baffling even seasoned professionals.

Dr. Alan Monroe, the small-town physician, was one of the first to experience this frustration firsthand. In early April, one of his patients—a previously healthy 40-year-old woman—collapsed during a routine appointment. Tests showed no clear cause for her symptoms, and she died within hours. Similar cases began appearing at nearby hospitals, each more puzzling than the last.

For Dr. Monroe and others on the front lines, the realization hit like a tidal wave: this wasn’t a regional anomaly. This was something far bigger, and far deadlier, than anyone had anticipated.

By late April, the cracks in the facade of normalcy were impossible to ignore. Major news outlets began reporting on clusters of mysterious deaths in Seattle, New York, and Miami. Social media exploded with rumors and conspiracy theories, ranging from government cover-ups to bioterrorism. The term “Thanatos virus” started trending, and suddenly, everyone had an opinion.

In homes across the country, families gathered around televisions and smartphones, searching for answers. For the first time, fear began to creep into the collective consciousness. People stocked up on hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes. Grocery stores saw runs on canned goods and bottled water. Masks, once the domain of healthcare workers, became a hot commodity.

Yet, even as panic began to set in, many clung to the hope that this too would pass. The United States had weathered crises before—surely this would be no different. But for those paying attention, the calm had already broken. The storm was here.",1,1732053763.0,johnderossett,0,1.0,False

Not as in cheating or fighting or anything. We just kind of got so busy with our own stuff that we didn’t take Care of each other - or our relationship. 
We both started university this fall, she had just moved out and she’s been dealing with some mental health issues for a while - which we’ve talked about and tries to work on. But it all just got too much, and the mental stuff got much worse during summer. This, along with us just not being together enough - and us being, idk how to express it, but, different when we then were together - made her break up with me.
I don’t hold a grudge towards her, and I can’t stand when people tell me “forget about her” or that I need to start thinking “fuck her”. I don’t feel that way, at all. However I do know, that I need to not be, hung up on her - and not to count on us getting back together. 
But I have to try. When we were good, oh my days we were good. We talked about what our babies names were going to be…

So, some info on our breakup: she more or less told me “I’m so sorry, I don’t want to do this - this is a last resort. I just have to focus on me, and my mental health before I can be a fair girlfriend to you - and help salvage our relationship.” And “I feel/think that if we are right for each other, we always will be - and I think we are”. When we/she broke up, we agreed to not blocking each other and stuff like that - and told each other that if shit goes bad, we can always text/call the other person. None of us have blocked the other one, she however has erased the pictures of us on her instagram (I haven’t gathered the balls to do so, yet)…

And, since then (a month ago) we haven’t spoken to each other. But I have to text her. I have to try us again - I have to know whether we just didn’t work out anymore, or if we didn’t work out whilst dealing with too much of life. If that makes sense?
The thing is, I really don’t know how or what to text her. It’s not like Im going to ask her to be my girlfriend as the first thing, but maybe take a walk have a coffee - or even just text a bit, and then later on ask to meetup.
So, my question is: what do I text her? When do I do so, now or one more month of no contact)? Or something else. ",1,1732053572.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

They can make a video of it, if anything if the money is an issue I’m sure they will make money from it. If I was to have so much money my mom would be UP TO DATE.

Don’t give me hate I’m genuinely curious I do understand they may just not want that but I wonder if it’s ever been offered.  I feel like no just because if they can’t even take her to get her nails done imagine something as costly as fixing teeth.  I understand they most likely smoke and drink coffee but that doesn’t change the fact that both moms and kids want to fix themselves to feel better about themselves I’m sure grandma and Mindy would too, of course they aren’t just going to pay for it they probably can’t afford it. Both CP and CM should offer it IF they haven’t yet because I’m not there to know if they have or haven’t so I’m just assuming based on almost daily life videos.

I have had this smoke a good handful of times, but every single time it comes to me like a warm hug. It is so warm, spicy, and packed with chewy goodness. Part of the reason why I feel so good about this one, is I knew my outside cigar time is coming to an end in my neck of the woods. But truthfully I’ve had multiple of these and ever single one is so good and consistent. I had this one with an iced coffee and a splash of cinnamon creamer and it was an incredible cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla experience throughout. This stick scratched an itch I’ve been really looking for as of recent, and I can’t wait for the next one. In my opinion, if I didn’t already know the ‘wonderful’ price tag, I would blindly think this is a “premium” smoke. I absolutely cannot recommend these enough if you’re a fan of the lighter leaf.

A strange, tingly feeling. A feely feeling. A feeling that felt… feely.

“What *is* this feeling?” Jeffrey whispered to himself, his giant foam fingers trembling. It wasn’t just any old feeling, like the one he got when he found an extra fry at the bottom of the bag. No, this was a feeling that buzzed in his toes and tickled his brain, like a thousand tiny caterpillars doing the cha-cha.

“This feeling is different,” Jeffrey murmured, staring at the moon with his unnervingly wide smile. “It’s like... I’m happy, but also weird. But also powerful? But also… itchy?” He scratched his glitter-covered elbow. “It’s a feely feeling that feels… SO FEELY!”

The feeling kept growing as he went on his nightly giggle mission. Every time he replaced someone’s shampoo with jelly or sprinkled confetti in their coffee maker, the feely feeling swelled in his chest, like a balloon being filled with whipped cream. “This feely feeling is my PURPOSE!” Jeffrey shouted to no one in particular.

But as he climbed into someone’s bedroom window and filled their slippers with pudding, the feely feeling became overwhelming. “This feeling… it’s too much! It’s like happiness, but mixed with chaos! Like sunshine… covered in glitter… on FIRE!”

He paused, staring at his reflection in a goldfish bowl on the bedside table. “Is this… who I am now? Am I *Jeffrey*? Or am I… THE GIGGLE-MAKER?!”

The feely feeling didn’t answer, because it wasn’t a person and that’s not how feelings work. But Jeffrey nodded solemnly anyway. “This feeling is my guide. My truth. My DESTINY.” He wiped a single glittery tear from his cheek and whispered, “And it feels... SO. FEELY.”",0,1732053045.0,creepcast,3,0.17,False

1gv8uby,https://www.reddit.com/r/NootropicsOverview/comments/1gv8uby/i_quit_caffeine_and_heres_what_happened/,"I Quit Caffeine, and Here's What Happened","I wanted to share my journey of quitting caffeine and what it’s done for me. First, let me say I *loved* my morning coffee. It wasn’t just about the energy boost; it was a ritual, a warm hug in a cup. But over time, I started noticing some things: jitteriness, a mid-afternoon crash, and occasional anxiety that seemed to creep up out of nowhere.

So, I decided to take a break and see what life without caffeine would feel like. Here's what I’ve learned, both from my own experience and some solid science. 

# The First Week: The Struggle Was Real

Let’s not sugarcoat it: quitting caffeine isn’t easy. The first 3–4 days were rough. I had headaches (classic caffeine withdrawal symptom), felt sluggish, and just wanted my coffee back. This is because caffeine blocks adenosine, the chemical that makes you feel tired. When you quit, your body has to recalibrate, and it can feel *ugh*.

Pro tip: **Hydrate like crazy** and get good sleep during this phase. Also, herbal teas like chamomile were my best friend.

# The Benefits I’ve Noticed

Once I got past the withdrawal, the benefits really started to shine:

1. **Better Sleep** 😴 Caffeine can stick around in your system for 6–8 hours, sometimes longer. Without it, I started falling asleep faster and waking up feeling more refreshed. Science backs this up—caffeine can delay your circadian rhythm and reduce deep sleep quality.
2. **Steady Energy Levels** ⚡ No more 3 PM crashes! My energy feels more stable throughout the day now. Without the caffeine rollercoaster, I’m not constantly reaching for pick-me-ups.
3. **Less Anxiety** 🧘‍♂️ Caffeine can increase cortisol (the stress hormone) and heart rate, which sometimes made me feel on edge. Without it, I feel calmer and more focused.
4. **Improved Digestion** 🥗 Coffee can irritate the stomach lining and mess with your gut. Since quitting, I’ve noticed my digestion feels a lot smoother—no more random stomach discomfort or acid reflux after my morning cup.
5. No More Dependency 🙌 One of the best parts? I don’t need caffeine to function anymore. I wake up and feel naturally alert (okay, most days—I’m still human). It’s freeing to not rely on something just to feel “normal.”

# The Science Behind it

For those of you who like the nitty-gritty:

* **Adenosine Receptors Reset**: Over time, quitting caffeine allows your body to restore its natural sensitivity to adenosine, which regulates your sleep-wake cycle.
* **Cortisol Reduction**: Caffeine spikes cortisol, and while that can give you a temporary energy boost, it can also contribute to anxiety and stress.
* **Improved Hydration**: Caffeine is a diuretic, which can lead to dehydration if you’re not careful. Since quitting, I feel more hydrated, which definitely helps with energy and skin health.

# Will I Ever Drink Coffee Again?

Probably! I’m not anti-caffeine; I just wanted to reset my relationship with it. I might bring it back for special occasions or when I truly need an extra boost. But now, I know I don’t *need* it every day, and that feels amazing.

# If You're Thinking About Quitting...

My advice: give it a shot! Even if it’s just for a week or two. Start slow if needed—switch to decaf or cut back gradually to avoid major withdrawal symptoms. And if you’re looking for alternatives, try herbal teas, hot lemon water, or even just plain ol’ water with a slice of cucumber for a refreshing pick-me-up.

We kept it professional at work, but I would obviously get to know her here and there. Eventually, when her contract ended, I mustered the courage to express my interest and offered her my number if she was ever interested to grab some coffee as a first date. To my surprise, she actually wanted to give me her number instead. She was just as excited and told me that she was happy that I asked her. This made me ecstatic. The next day I message her and ask how she's doing, to see when she would be free. She told me she was adjusting to her new contract position at a different company and said that she wants to focus on her training and that she'd call me when she gets the chance. No big deal on my end; she's busy. I didn't think of anything of it, but the next day she actually calls me. Unfortunately, I had a responsibility in my job that required my attention to be there. I briefly picked up her call, said hi and told her that I was at work and needed to take care of this; I asked if I could call her when I finish (which would have been in less than an hour). She told me to instead message her. When I finished up for that day, I promptly messaged her. No response. A few days go by, and I decide to message her again, to see if she was still interested. She texts me back and says that she would try to call me this weekend to plan something. Unfortunately, that was this past weekend. Did she lose interest that quickly? Did I present myself being too eager or incorrectly? Or am I getting in my head? I would think it would be reasonable that I needed to fulfill my job duties and that I'd return her call quickly; unless I am approaching it wrong.  Is there anything I could possibly do now, or is it best to live and let die.

at 18, i can’t drink coffee. i can’t have anything with too much caffeine and i definitely can’t have more than one cup of something with just a bit of caffeine. my heart rate will go up and i’ll get a bad migraine with too much caffeine. same goes for any stimulants. i’ll feel short of breath just *walking.*

Since the beginning of our relationship, I’ve tried to introduce her to my friends and do more social activities with her. I have a relatively medium size friend group. All great people. 

But she refuses to meet them. She told me she has a problem with socializing with new people. But after 5 months, it’s gotten to the point where it feels hurtful that she doesn’t want to meet anyone of importance in my life (family included). 

She hates parties. And never wants to go out to any social gatherings with me. 

Yet, she always emphasizes how she wants to have a girls night out with her friends and go dancing at the clubs. 

I’ve established some boundaries with her that made me feel comfortable. I said that girl night would be cool if I could maybe meet up with her and bring some of my guy friends. (her friends are all single and actively hooking up with people) so i get a little nervous with the whole club culture thing. 

The reason I set these boundaries is because I’ve been cheated out by the last 4 people I dated. One of which had a secret husband I didn’t know about. All of this completely destroyed me and took an entire year of therapy to get me to be able to trust anyone again. 

Alongside with the clubbing thing, she has established that she wants to meet more guy friends. Again, our boundaries were that I myself wouldn’t hang out with any women unless in group settings, and she wouldn’t with any men. 

But she continues to emphasize that she wants to reach a level of trust where we both CAN hang out with people of the opposite gender and not be worried. But she said she wants to be able to get “dinner” or “coffee” with other men. And, for me, that feels extremely sketchy. Not just for her, but for other men’s intentions. 

Even my therapist. She said, “why do single woman activities if you aren’t single?” To which I kind of agreed with her. 

What do yall think? Sorry if this comes off as a bit anxious

*Baking a dream*

A small bakery with the fragrance of sweet pastries,

Colourful candies on the tabletop,
A cozy atmosphere, filled with smiles,

With the sound of wind chimes,
A tall chef's hat adorning my head,

And a heart full of happiness
Is all I wish for.

Small plants along the door,
And a carpet-covered floor...

And wooden tables,
Little kids who drool over the cookies
On the counter...

Meeting customers in a hurry—
With a silly smile, what a funny encounter.

Sounds of grinding coffee,
And a faint aroma of toffee.

Someone getting a forgetful cake for a late birthday gift,
A small, sparkly cupcake—perhaps for the date?

And the soft creak of a rusted doorknob!

A dream that in my heart remains untold...
A life of sweetness, warmth, and gold...


_______***

""What the hell are you doing, Siya?"" barked Mr. James, my English professor, as he yanked the paper from my desk.

""Haha, you silly little thing. You're not thinking of submitting this for the annual literary competition, are you? That would be hilarious."" He smirked, crumpling the page before tearing it from my notebook.

Tears stained my desk that day.


_______***

Next Month

I stood on the roof of the school building. Classes would start in a few minutes. It didn’t matter.


_____***

A Few Hours Earlier

“Did you hear? Mr. James is being promoted!” Sunny said, leaning against my desk.

“What happened?” I asked.

He handed me his phone. It was an interview on a national channel.

“So, Mr. James, is it because you’re an English professor or because you enjoy writing that you composed such a beautiful poem, Baked with Happiness? Even the title makes you feel warm!” said the interviewer.

I stared at the screen, confused. “Wait, what is this?”

Sunny scrolled down to show me the poem. Between bites of his snack bar, he said, “He wrote this poem and won some big literary competition. Now it’s being sent to nationals! He’s going to be famous. Try to get a selfie with him before he’s out of reach!”

The phone slipped from my hands. I recognized my poem.


_____***

I ran to the washroom, tears spilling over. My life couldn’t possibly be this cruel. How could someone everyone admired—our beloved professor—do this to me? He had everything: respect, success, and admiration. Why would he need to steal my work?

Later, I confronted him. “Mr. James, why did you do it? You stole my poem and mocked me for it, only to submit it as your own!”

He smirked, leaning closer. “Watch your mouth, Siya,” he hissed, then grabbed me by the hair and slammed my head against the desk. “If you know what’s good for you, you’ll hand over all your work. I don’t want any trouble in my new life.”

Bruised and humiliated, I stood on the rooftop. I had no sports achievements, no academic accolades—writing was all I had. Now that someone had stolen even my words, I felt empty.

“If God wills, may I find peace,” I whispered.

As I gazed downward, something shiny on the ground caught my eye. Curious, I climbed down and picked it up. It was a sticker that read:

> “Don’t give up. Get your revenge. Call #5432REVENGE and trust us.”



I chuckled bitterly. “What a stupid ad.”

On impulse, I dialed the number. My phone had no signal. Frustrated, I ran outside the school and tried again.

The call directed me to an old arcade center.


______***

At the center, the place was eerily empty. Only a dusty Mario arcade machine lit up as I approached. The screen instructed me to insert a dollar. Hesitant but curious, I complied.

The machine then asked me to scan the sticker. When I did, an interface appeared:

GET REVENGE / FORGIVE

I stared at the screen. My fingers hovered over “FORGIVE” before I chose “GET REVENGE.”

A grim reaper’s scythe flashed across the screen. A set of rules appeared, narrated by a small fairy on the corner of the screen:

1. Your payment has been received.


2. Do not tell anyone about this.


3. Trust us.


4. Follow the rules for a satisfying result.



“Do you agree?”

I clicked “YES.” Suddenly, a pen ejected from the machine.

The screen displayed: Write your revenge. But remember: it cannot contain fictional themes or harm uninvolved people.

I scribbled:

 “Mr. James shits himself in the middle of class.”



The pen glowed faintly, and I couldn’t help but laugh. It felt good to write again.


______***

Moments Later

Sunny’s call broke my thoughts. “You won’t believe what just happened!” he exclaimed.

“What?” I asked.

“Mr. James just shat himself in class! It was so gross, but everyone was laughing hysterically! He ran out in shame!”

I froze, staring at the pen in my hand. Could it really work?


_______***

Over the next few days, I tested the pen. I wrote:

> “Mr. James is exposed for stealing others’ work and publicly shamed for it.”



The pen’s glow seemed softer this time, but the words still disappeared.

By the next morning, the school buzzed with whispers. News broke that Mr. James had been stealing students’ work for years. He was publicly shamed, and the competition committee stripped him of his award.

It didn’t stop there. 

One day, as I walked through the school, I saw an old man standing alone. Sunny grabbed my arm.

“Who’s that?” I asked.

“That’s the father of a student who died mysteriously two years ago,” Sunny whispered. “Rumor has it that Mr. James was involved.”

I approached the old man and handed him a bottle of cold banana milk from the canteen.

As we talked, I slipped the sticker into his hand.

“Don’t give up. Get your revenge. Call #5432REVENGE and trust us.”

He looked confused but smiled.
---

___*****



One Month Later

Sunny burst into the classroom, waving his phone. “Remember the old man? Turns out Mr. James confessed in a letter before…” He hesitated. “Well, you know, he… ended things. The police found proof connecting him to the boy’s death.”

I didn’t know how to feel.

The next day, I received a package: an expensive set of calligraphy pens. The old man had left a note: “Thank you for your kindness. My son would’ve admired someone like you.”

_____***

Epilogue

Dear Diary,

You won’t believe this, but my poem has been reinstated, and I won the competition! My work is going to nationals. I never imagined such a day would come.

Oh, and guess what? The theme for the next competition is revenge. I think I’m ready for it.

My doctor is kind and did a good job of walking my through everything. As always, found the speculum going in uncomfortable. Numbing shot definitely pinchy, felt a rushing feeling and heart beating faster. That was probably the worst part and it was over in a couple seconds. The actual “leep”ing was very quick, she took two slices (?) off. The cauterizing (?) is that what she does? Was also uncomfortable but I wouldn’t quite describe it as pain. And that went on for longer than I expected. She said one part was just bleeding more and wanted to make sure she tended to it properly. I also find the speculum removal uncomfortable but now I know to ask them to give me a heads up and I try to relax my pelvic floor before they remove. 

Hope that helps anyone wondering. It’s obviously not fun but it was over quite quickly, like not longer than 25 or 30 minutes including them talking stuff over at the start and after the procedure. 

She said take it easy and no heavy lifting for the next few days, and if I feel up to it I can do my regular work outs next week. I won’t push it. They said expect bleeding, cramps and coffee grounds looking discharge. Super heavy bleeding, super intense stomach pain or fever would be reasons to go to the ER. 

Definitely the worst part of this whole process has been the emotional feelings and what if feelings. Now I will be nervous to hear the results. But if you are nervous about the leep procedure, I can tell you from my experience that it really was not too bad. ",3,1732051251.0,PreCervicalCancer,0,1.0,False

I have been dating my boyfriend for over a year and he is wonderful in many ways, but I am just not happy with how we approach money and I need advice on how to talk to him about it.

When we first started dating he said he didn't like splitting bills, he preferred to take turns in paying, which I agreed to. However, I have started to feel a bit resentful because I feel like I am picking up the tabs more often, and it makes me feel stressed not knowing who's turn it is to pay. They may be really little things, for example we will queue up to get coffee and nothing is said about who will pay, so we get to the end of the line and I feel pressured to offer even if I feel like it isn't my turn, because he is making no move to pay and we are at the register. This has meant I never feel like I am 'treating him' or vice versa. It also manifests in other scenarios too, where if I arrange a meal to treat a friend for their birthday, he doesn't offer to pay his way because I invited him as an opportunity for them to meet, but this means I am ending up paying for everyone. He is a very thoughtful kind person in many other ways, it is just feels like he has the approach to money of someone much younger who likes to see what they can get away with and needs to be actively asked to contribute, rather than realising what is fair.

For context, I we do not live together and are in our 30s, so these are 'fun' expenses - eating out, coffees etc., neither of us is struggling financially and we earn very similar amounts.

I am not sure if I am just being too stingy about it and it will all even out in the end, I am not sure if it is even about the money. I want to suggest we either start going 50/50 or have a joint 'date' account we both contribute to and use for these kinds of expenses normally, then we can occasionally treat each other on special occasions - what do you think?

Although diet is a substantial determinant of the human gut microbiome, the interplay between specific foods and microbial community structure remains poorly understood. Coffee is a habitually consumed beverage with established metabolic and health benefits. We previously found that coffee is, among >150 items, the food showing the highest correlation with microbiome components. Here we conducted a multi-cohort, multi-omic analysis of US and UK populations with detailed dietary information from a total of 22,867 participants, which we then integrated with public data from 211 cohorts (N = 54,198). The link between coffee consumption and microbiome was highly reproducible across different populations (area under the curve of 0.89), largely driven by the presence and abundance of the species Lawsonibacter asaccharolyticus. Using in vitro experiments, we show that coffee can stimulate growth of L. asaccharolyticus. Plasma metabolomics on 438 samples identified several metabolites enriched among coffee consumers, with quinic acid and its potential derivatives associated with coffee and L. asaccharolyticus. This study reveals a metabolic link between a specific gut microorganism and a specific food item, providing a framework for the understanding of microbial dietary responses at the biochemical level.

Main
Coffee is consumed almost worldwide and has been shown to exert beneficial effects on human health, including lowering all-cause and cardiovascular disease-specific mortality1,2, risks of type 2 diabetes3,4, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease5 and cancer6,7, as well as other diseases8,9. Coffee’s nutritional epidemiology is unique in that it is typically either consumed every day or not consumed at all and is thus reported with high accuracy10. Combined with its unique chemical composition, this makes coffee an excellent model to unravel the metabolomic processes by which the gut microbiome responds to dietary components.

The benefits of coffee may be ascribable to some of its polyphenol components including chlorogenic acid, the caffeic ester of quinic acid, and N-methylpyridium, a derivative of trigonelline9,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20. The gut microbiome is involved in the metabolism of coffee and potentially mediates its health effects11,12,16,21,22,23,24,25. One small study showed an increase in Bacteroides, Porphyromonas and Prevotella among coffee drinkers in a cohort of 147 healthy individuals using quantitative PCR22. A 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing study on the effects of coffee on murine gut microbial communities also reported an increase in Prevotella16. Similarly, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of the colonic mucosal microbiomes from 34 healthy participants showed higher alpha diversity and an increase in the genera Faecalibacterium and Alistipes in response to caffeine23. In support of the uniqueness of coffee’s interaction with the gut microbiome, our initial ZOE Personalized Responses to Dietary Composition Trial (PREDICT 1) metagenomics study25 showed that coffee consumption had, among over 150 food items, the highest correlation with gut microbiome composition in ~1,000 individuals.

In this study, we conducted the largest investigation so far of the human gut microbiome link with coffee consumption by leveraging the ZOE PREDICT cohorts, the Mind–Body Study (MBS) and the Men’s Lifestyle Validation Study (MLVS). Together, we analysed over 22,000 shotgun metagenomic samples from participants who provided detailed reports on long-term coffee consumption. This showed a tight interplay between coffee and a specific microbiome member, the Lawsonibacter asaccharolyticus species, which was recently isolated from human faeces26. We verified that it grows better in vitro when media is supplemented with coffee. By analysing joint plasma metabolomes, we showed a L. asaccharolyticus-dependent increase in blood levels of quinic acid, trigonelline and caffeine, plus other uncharacterized molecules, among coffee drinkers compared with non-drinkers. This work helps unravel the role of the human microbiome in coffee metabolism and shows the potential for future microbiome studies of individual dietary factors.

Results
Studying the interplay between coffee and the microbiome
A total of 35,214 metagenomes from five ZOE PREDICT cohorts (PREDICT1, PREDICT2, PREDICT3 US21, PREDICT3 US22A and PREDICT3 UK22A)27, the MBS28, and the MLVS29 were included in this study, together with 18,984 metagenomes from public sources including healthy individuals (n = 8,728), non-Westernized individuals (n = 1,195; Methods), newborns and infants (n = 1,623), ancient microbiome samples (n = 37), non-human primates (n = 201) and 7,423 samples from individuals with a specific disease (35 diseases). Overall, these sets lead to a total number of 54,198 metagenomic samples considered (Fig. 1a), all profiled using MetaPhlAn 4 (ref. 30). In addition, the metagenomic profiles of 23,115 of these samples were coupled with highly detailed food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) covering over 150 food items from the PREDICT1, PREDICT2, PREDICT3 US22A, PREDICT3 UK22A, MBS and MLVS cohorts (Methods). We also analysed 438 plasma metabolomes and 364 faecal metatranscriptomes from the MBS and MLVS cohorts (Fig. 1b).

For later comparisons of microbiome distributions across different populations, we retrieved n = 18,984 metagenomic samples from public sources, including healthy adult individuals, newborns, non-Westernized (non-West.) individuals, ancient samples and non-human primates (NHP).

FFQs surveyed nutritional habits of the participants from four PREDICT cohorts, MBS and MLVS (n = 22,867 after removing individuals above the 99th percentile of coffee intake in the PREDICT cohorts as outliers). Participants were categorized as ‘high’, ‘moderate’ and ‘never’ coffee drinkers as previously established25. c, Median Spearman’s correlation and median AUCs from a random forest regressor and a random forest classifier trained on the microbiome composition estimated by MetaPhlAn 4 (ref. 30). d, The number of never (light green), moderate (dark cyan) and high-coffee drinkers (brown). e, ROC and AUC of random forest classifiers discriminating participants between pairs of the three coffee drinker classes, assessed in a tenfold, ten times repeated cross-validations (CV) that benefited from the other cohorts during the training phase as in the leave-one-dataset-out approach (LODO; Methods).

Taking advantage of the four PREDICT cohorts with full dietary information (n = 22,595), we first used a random forest algorithm to associate single food items with microbiome. Microbiome species-level genome bin (SGB) composition was highly predictive of total coffee intake from FFQs in a cross-validation setting. Spearman’s correlation between predicted versus real coffee consumption reached values above 0.5 for the PREDICT1, PREDICT3 US22A and PREDICT3 UK22A studies. When using random forests to distinguish the top versus bottom quartiles of food intake, coffee was again the one most accurately predicted by microbiome composition (area under the curve (AUC) of >0.8; Fig. 1c). Importantly, milk, dairy cream, sugar and honey, which are commonly added to coffee and are present in the PREDICT FFQs, achieved much lower prediction performances (Spearman’s ρ < 0.1, AUC ~0.55–0.58), with the only partial exception of milk and soy/rice milk in the PREDICT3 UK22A cohort (ρ = 0.26 and 0.21, AUC of 0.76 and 0.7, respectively). Coffee is therefore not only a food with ascertained health effects, but also most strongly associated with the human microbiome among ~150 food items.

Coffee consumption is strongly linked to the gut microbiome
To better characterize the link between the gut microbiome and coffee, we classified individuals from PREDICT1, PREDICT2, PREDICT3 US22A, PREDICT3 UK22A and MBS–MLVS into three coffee-drinking levels: ‘never’, ‘moderate’ and ‘high’ (Fig. 1b,d). This categorization used the same thresholds previously applied by a panel of nutritionists in the PREDICT1 study25. Individuals with a coffee intake up to 20 g a day (less than three cups a month) were classified into the group ‘never’, individuals with an intake ≥600 g of coffee per day (more than three cups a day) were classified as ‘high’ and coffee drinkers between these two values were categorized as ‘moderate’. These thresholds, representing the 24.9th and 88.95th percentiles of coffee intake in the PREDICT1 cohort (Supplementary Table 1), were applied to all other cohorts (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 1). In addition, samples from individuals with a coffee intake above the 99th percentile were excluded as outliers potentially due to data collection issues. In total, 5,730 individuals were classified as ‘never’, 14,647 as ‘moderate’ and 2,490 as ‘high’ coffee drinkers (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Table 2).

We next used machine learning to evaluate the strength of the link between microbiome composition and coffee consumption levels31,32. We employed random forest classifiers trained on SGB-level abundances to distinguish between three pairs of conditions: never versus moderate, moderate versus high and never versus high coffee drinkers. The high and moderate categories were both highly separable from the never category (tenfold, ten times repeated cross-validation, median AUC across cohorts of 0.92 and 0.86, respectively; Extended Data Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 3). Weaker predictions were achieved for moderate versus high coffee drinkers (median AUC of 0.63), suggesting a limited dose-dependent association of coffee intake with the microbiome.

Cross-validation performances in distinguishing coffee consumption levels were consistent across datasets, but to further test the cross-population reproducibility of the microbiome signature, we applied the leave-one-dataset-out (LODO)32 as well as a ‘cross-LODO’ hybrid approach (that is, augmenting the training folds of a specific dataset with external datasets; Methods). The ‘cross-LODO’ analysis yielded a median AUC of 0.93 for the never versus high comparison, 0.87 for the never versus moderate comparison and 0.65 for the moderate versus high comparison (Fig. 1e, Extended Data Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 3). These findings suggest that the gut microbiome has distinct compositions in coffee drinkers compared with non-coffee drinkers, with a modest effect on differentiating the dose of coffee drinking.

L. asaccharolyticus is strongly linked with coffee
To investigate which gut microbiome features are associated with coffee intake, we correlated the ranked abundances of SGBs with participant’s coffee intake in each cohort (Spearman’s correlation) using raw and partial correlations (Supplementary Table 4 and Methods). Correlations were then meta-analysed across all cohorts (Supplementary Table 5 and Methods). In total, we found 291 correlations at q < 0.001 with 132 SGBs having ρ ≥ 0.05, and 298 when taking into account the effect of sex, age and body mass index (BMI) of the participants (q < 0.001, 130 with ρ ≥ 0.05; Supplementary Tables 6 and 7 and Extended Data Fig. 3).

While most of the correlations were positive, 46 partial correlations were negative and significant (q < 0.001), although none exceeded ρ values lower than −0.1. This suggests more stimulatory rather than inhibitory effects of coffee and its components on microbial species relative abundances (Extended Data Fig. 4a,b). Among the positive correlations, the strongest one involved the species L. asaccharolyticus (SGB15154), reaching ρ = 0.43 (0.41–0.45) and q < 10−10. In contrast, correlation between coffee and ɑ-diversity was much lower (ρ = 0.1 (0.05–0.15), p = 1.8 × 10−4; Extended Data Fig. 3). L. asaccharolyticus was first isolated in 201826,33, and as this strain remains the only one deposited in public biobanks, here we consider it to be representative for the species although other genomes (but not isolates) with conflicting taxonomic labels have been deposited (that is, Clostridium phoceensis34; Methods). The species responsible for the next two strongest associations were Massilioclostridium coli (SGB29305, ρ = 0.31 (0.27–0.35), q < 10−10) and the so-far uncharacterized Clostridium species ‘12CBH8’ (SGB7259, ρ = 0.3 (0.28–0.32), q < 10−10; Fig. 2a).

The black markers show the per-cohort partial correlations and the light blue markers indicate the average Spearman’s correlations adjusted by sex, age and BMI. b, The same SGBs are meta-analysed with Spearman’s partial correlations (par. corr.) between SGB abundances and decaffeinated (decaf.) coffee intake in the PREDICT1 and PREDICT3 UK22A cohorts, excluding individuals who consumed caffeinated coffee only (n = 262 and 4,055). The black markers show the per-cohort correlations and dark blue symbols refer to average correlations adjusted by sex, age, BMI and caffeinated coffee. c, The prevalence of the ten SGBs in the five cohorts analysed. d, The prevalence of L. asaccharolyticus across never, moderate and high coffee drinkers and nine US regions in the PREDICT2 and PREDICT3 US22A cohorts (n = 9,210).

We further investigated whether these associations were driven by caffeine by performing two meta-analyses on the PREDICT1 and PREDICT3 22UKA samples for which the intake of decaffeinated and caffeinated coffee was available. Partial correlations between SGB-ranked abundances and decaffeinated versus caffeinated coffee were run independently (excluding individuals who drank exclusively caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee, respectively). In addition, partial correlations were also adjusted for the other type of coffee consumed by the individuals in case their record reported both kinds. We identified 150 correlations, which remained highly significant after controlling for the decaffeinated coffee intake (q < 0.001, nparticipants = 12,089; Extended Data Fig. 4c and Supplementary Table 8). This indicated a substantial independence on caffeine of the observed impact on the microbiome. Next, we analysed the decaffeinated coffee association with the microbiome in individuals consuming decaffeinated coffee and adjusting by caffeinated coffee as well as by sex, age and BMI. In this reduced set of samples (nparticipants = 6,089) we identified 22 correlations at q < 0.001 and 66 at q < 0.1 (Supplementary Table 9). The top three correlations identified were L. asaccharolyticus (ρ = 0.27 (0.21–0.33), q < 10−10), the Lachnospiraceae SGB4777 (ρ = 0.18 (0.16–0.21), q < 10−10), and M. coli (SGB29305, ρ = 0.17 (0.13–0.2), q < 10−10; Fig. 2b).

As expected, several coffee-associated SGBs were also L. asaccharolyticus co-abundant SGBs, possibly indicating similar independent stimulatory effects of coffee rather than ecological relations (Extended Data Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 10). The top-five SGBs associated with L. asaccharolyticus abundance were, however, not among the strongest associations with coffee. In particular, the two SGBs with the strongest co-abundance pattern with L. asaccharolyticus were Dysosmobacter welbionis (SGB15078) and the Clostridiales bacterium SGB15143 (ρ = 0.57 and 0.51, respectively, q < 1 × 10−10; Extended Data Fig. 5), which were both only weakly associated with total coffee (ρ ≤ 0.05; Supplementary Table 7). Overall, these results indicate that a panel of species, and in particular L. asaccharolyticus is robustly associated with total and decaffeinated coffee consumption, suggesting that the association is not purely due to caffeine.

Effect of coffee on L. asaccharolyticus is supported in vitro
Among the top coffee-associated SGBs, L. asaccharolyticus showed the highest and the most uniform prevalence across all the cohorts (93.5%; Fig. 2c). In the ‘never’ group from the USA, its prevalence was uniformly high (average prevalence of 87.8 ± 2%) across nine different regions (samples from PREDICT2 and PREDICT3 US22A, n = 9,210). Over and above this, however, it was uniformly increased in all regions when considering coffee consumption; it increased from 87.8% to 95.6% in moderate drinkers and from 95.6% to 97.7% in high drinkers (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Table 11). Degree of urbanization (rural versus urban living context) was not associated with L. asaccharolyticus in the microbiome (Extended Data Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 12). Overall, the median abundance of L. asaccharolyticus ranged from 4.5- to 8-fold higher in the high compared with the never group (in the PREDICT3 US22A and MBS–MLVS cohorts), and 3.4- to 6.4-fold higher in the moderate versus the never group (in the PREDICT2 and MBS–MLVS cohorts; Supplementary Table 13). By contrast, the highest median fold change between moderate and high drinkers was only 1.4 and did not reach statistical significance in three out of five cohorts (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 14).

Fig. 3: L. asaccharolyticus is highly prevalent with about fourfold higher average abundance in coffee drinkers, and its growth is stimulated by coffee supplementation in vitro.

1gv830r,https://i.redd.it/x1lzrqzxbx1e1.png,"PSA: Real ID, renew DL/ID up to 2 years before expiration","***The main takeaway of this post -- you can renew your license up to two (2) years in advance. Plan accordingly.***

I've replied to a lot of posts in this sub as well as r/DMV and r/driving regarding permits, licences, IDs, vehicle titling, and vehicle registration.

One thing that a lot of folks have encountered is trouble getting a timely appointment with DPS to renew a driver's license. So that has prompted me to write up a few thoughts that some of you may find helpful.

The first thing I'm going to recommend is that you create a portal login with the official [Texas by Texas (TxT)](https://txt.texas.gov/) site for managing your license and vehicle registration. You can order a license renewal here if applicable; your previous photo will be used. You can also update your address when you move as required by law. And you can handle vehicle registration renewal.

The [Real ID Act](https://www.dhs.gov/real-id) currently requires that you update your DL/ID by May 7, 2025. This is necessary if you want to use it for federal identification purposes, such as boarding domestic flights or entering secure federal facilities. However, if you have another REAL ID compliant card (e.g. valid US passport), then you can use that as your REAL ID. But you're soon going to start hearing more about this deadline on the news. And that, in turn, will drive demand for appointments from those who have procrastinated and/or are just now realizing they're ID is expiring soon. DPS will be even busier.

With a [license or ID renewal](https://www.dps.texas.gov/section/driver-license/renew-your-texas-dl-cdl-motorcycle-license-or-id), you must go to DPS in person [by appointment](https://public.txdpsscheduler.com/) for every other renewal; so about every 16 years. But if you don't already have a (gold star) Real ID compliant DL/ID, then you must go into DPS via appointment. I'm not here to debate how one location or another *may* allow walk-ins. So moving on with appointments, many locations in urban and surrounding areas may have wait times 1-6 months out.

As you're able, it's best to plan ahead in scheduling your license renewal appointment to avoid driving without a valid license etc. One thing a lot of people don't know is that you can ***renew up to two (2) years before your expiration date***. Note, a CDL can only be renewed up to one (1) year before it expires. The expiration year will not be affected by renewing early; it won't be cut short etc. It will always be eight (8) years from last expiration date on your license. So whether it's online or in person, you can plan (way) ahead on when to get it done. Generally speaking, there's likely no need to wait until it's close to your current expiration.

I recommend that you keep a picture of your DL/ID somewhere safe. Why!? Your DL/ID has a unique DD audit number on it that changes with every printing. In order to even have the option to [request a replacement online](https://www.dps.texas.gov/section/driver-license/replace-your-driver-license-commercial-driver-license-or-id-card) (e.g. lost/stolen), you'll need the DD number along with your DL/ID number etc. Without it, you'll have no option but to schedule a dreaded DPS appointment. And then be prepared to bring supporting identification documents. So take a picture of your license or at least write down all of the info. Keep it in a drawer, hide it in a coffee can in the freezer, email it to yourself ... whatever. But keep it available by whatever means with which you're comfortable.

For reference and some quick answers, here's a basic page full of official [ID and license FAQs](https://txapps.texas.gov/tolapp/txdl/faq.dl).

For those new drivers needing to work towards getting their first permit/license, I'm simply going to link this [starter page](https://www.dps.texas.gov/section/driver-license/how-apply-texas-driver-license) for now. I've answered *a lot* of questions regarding this topic. There are often variables that make an answer different from one person to the next.

Getting back to those DPS appointments, the consensus is that the refresh method may work well for a lot of folks. It may potentially help you get an appointment sooner than later.

**REFRESH METHOD:**  
Your best bet for getting an appointment sooner than later is to use the refresh method -- refreshing (e.g. F5) your browser page however often. Get in the online scheduler from 7:15am-8:00am on a weekday. It appears cancelled appointments may be dropped in around that time. Note, I'm quite certain that you can't book an appointment if you already have one scheduled. Therefore, you may need to cancel one in the distant future as applicable. Also, be prepared to search for more rural DPS locations a little farther from home (up to an hour away). Change the various zip codes you search to rural towns accordingly in order to see those particular location listings.

And finally (as a bonus to this post), I'm going to suggest that everyone with children should consider getting them official IDs. Honestly, it's something very few parents even know exists. [You can get an ID card for your children *regardless* of their age.](https://www.dps.texas.gov/section/driver-license/how-apply-texas-identification-card) It's a Real ID Act piece of identification ... just like your driver's license (or ID). It's something to consider.

Some potential benefits: 

* travel (e.g. planes)
* school enrollment
* lost in crowd, store, etc
* abduction (immediate and up-to-date identification)
* medical emergencies
* identity theft protection
* getting other documents (original and/or replacement)
* applying for jobs

1gv81bt,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1gv81bt/was_i_self_sabotaging_or_am_i_not_attracted/,"Was I self sabotaging, or am I not attracted? ","I (22F) started dating a guy that I met through working at a hospital (23M) in June. He is shorter than me, I’m 5’5” and I would say he’s about 5’2”-5’3” although he tried to claim he was 5’5” (he is visibly shorter than me and I would have to go down to hug/kiss so I knew that wasn’t right). He isn’t my type I would normally go for, more nerdy and I’d never gone for anyone shorter. I wanted to give it a chance as I had ended a 3 year relationship a couple months prior, which was a toxic relationship. Thought maybe dating outside my “type” would be a good thing. I’m usually liking the athletic type. 

I opened up to him pretty quickly about things and there was definitely some chemistry. However, I found myself getting the “ick” every time we would hangout. I’m gonna list some major icks I got. On our second or third date/hangout, he had his bare feet out on the coffee table and said “sorry if they stink, I’ve been out all day and haven’t showered yet”. I was so turned off but didn’t want to embarrass him. He had a couple month relationship with another coworker prior, which seemed more like a situationship but he claimed it was a relationship. She moved away from our college town and pretty much ghosted him. This was his only “relationship” besides high school relationships that were short lived. 

Unlike other college men this man had his entire apartment decorated with African art. And some other interesting pieces. One time when I was over, he got dressed and came out in an African cultural shirt. I kinda was like what is this lol and he said it was from a friend but he wouldn’t ever wear it out (he’s white). He does Buddhism practices, and majored in psychology and philosophy which i think gives a little insight into personality maybe. Very analytical when it comes to people and relationships. He has intense eye contact, doesn’t look away when speaking to someone and holds eye contact still when the conversation has pauses or dies out. At first I found it kinda attractive, but then creepy. And it wasn’t just to me it was something he did for everyone, so sometimes girls would take it as a romantic thing. 

His apartment has a pool so we went together once and nobody was there. We sat by the pool, and at one point he started like meditating? Criss cross applesauce and rolling his head in circles with eyes closed for about a minute or two. I got a major ick. I feel if we were in private it would be different but we were at a public place lol. 

A lot of the time when I would come over his toilet looked like a shit bomb went off and he just kinda left it. I would literally clean the toilet for him lol and not say anything. On our first few dates he wasn’t paying for everything and even found myself paying for him multiple times. 

He invited me to come home with him after a month of seeing each other which freaked me out a little but I went anyways. I met literally his entire family even though he claimed it was casual. Went out to eat with his grandma, met his aunts, uncles, other grandma and her spouse, brother, etc. it was a whole event. He said this was normal to him and that in his high school relationships he had his girlfriends meet them too. I was so shocked he brought that up as his comparisons and as serious relationships. He told me he had never been in love before, like when both people say I love you to each other. I asked because I felt he seemed a little inexperienced. 

When I had met his family is when he first started calling me his girlfriend and there was no conversation about this. I felt it was kinda weird we hadn’t had that talk yet or at all even afterwards. I personally wouldn’t introduce someone to my family until like 3 months in. 

He had this like baby voice? He would use with me when cuddling, starting on the second or third date too. Ick. He wore shorts that went past his knees, and he’s already short so it made him look even shorter. He dresses very formal when he goes out. He has boots (not like timbs, like target kinda style) and would wear polka dot shirts / patterned button ups, turtlenecks, and dress pants. It’s almost like hipster aesthetic and nerdy mixed. I knew I didn’t really like his style but thought I would get over it or could change that maybe. Sometimes patients at work thought he was gay based on style. He has a very particular walk that gives me an ick, it’s like a Lego character. I can tell it’s him from far away based on the walk. 

In bed, he couldn’t keep it up and wouldn’t be able to finish. He takes ADHD medication and also said he needs more emotional connection. He likes eye contact during intercourse and I feel awkward doing that at first with someone. I told him what I like in bed and he never did it. At a certain point, him touching me was starting to give an ick, like him trying to be sensual with me was repulsing me. 

He talks VERY formal, and even to me over text. I told him it felt he was talking to me like a colleague. One time he texted me “would you like to accompany me on my walk?” And I was like why wouldn’t you just say “I’m going on a walk wanna come with?” or something lol. He wouldn’t text me throughout the day, just kinda random here and there about whatever. He told me he wasn’t like this in high school, but had found who he really is. Changed his vocabulary, style, interests. Nobody in his family was like him. 

After our first sort of disagreement/argument, he said “I would accept back rubs and flowers as apologies” something like that. It was a joke I know but it was giving diva and gave me an ick. 

I ended up telling him I wasn’t feeling the attraction completely or there is some incompatibility, and ended things. He was definitely hurt and didn’t want to stay friends or anything. I find myself wondering if I was self sabotaging, but think I may just be more lonely so that’s why I question it. Does it sound like this was an attraction issue or like self sabotaging?

Please bear in mind these were notes to myself and were made as the match finished so can be a bit emotional, but that's how I felt at he time.

01: Away draw vs Leicester (1-1)
Very disappointing. We got low-blocked. 38-year-old Vardy had a hard-on for us and scored. There’s real hate there from him.

02: Home win vs Everton (4-0)
Everton were complete shite. Not getting hopeful yet, though—it was at home against probably the third-worst team in the Prem.

03: Away loss vs Newcastle (1-2)
I knew we wouldn’t win; we can’t win away matches, and Newcastle are one of our many bogey teams. I had a £10 bet on a 1-1 draw, but we conceded two idiotic goals. We created a ton of chances but never scored as usual (our goal was an own goal—pathetic). Only caveat is we were missing Solanke and VDV. Same shit, different match. Useless.

04: Home loss vs Arsenal (0-1)
I bet on a draw. We conceded from a corner again. We ponced around their penalty area again. We passed like shit, we crossed like shit. We had a few good chances in the first half. No excuses—Arsenal are a league better than us. We always let a goal in against anyone. Postecoglou could well be sacked by Christmas. I reckon we could be in or near the relegation zone by then at this rate. I paid £15 to watch that match as well.
4 points from 4 games—urgh.

05: Carabao Cup: Won 2-1 away vs Coventry
We were shite until the 88th minute (not a single shot on goal, ffs), then suddenly scored two in a few minutes (Kulusevski and Brennan Johnson as subs) mainly because Coventry weakened, and we were fitter. Played 70% of the B team to start. Not inspiring, but a win. Something’s up with Romero—people are saying he’s at fault for three of the four goals conceded so far this season. I won £47 as this result paired in my patent with another correct score. The third correct score didn’t come in.

06: Home win vs Brentford (3-1)
I was ill, didn’t see it live, and couldn’t find the full match or decent highlights later. By all accounts, we did okay.

07: Europa League: Home win vs Qarabag (3-0)
First clean sheet for a while and a solid win despite Spurs being down to 10 men after 8 minutes. Be realistic, though—their top player in their league is worth £3M, so we should have won even with five men left in the team. Slightly rotated squad.

08: Away win vs Man Utd (3-0)
Well, talk about a turnaround. Man U were total shite, though, and we had an xG of 5, so we should have scored more. Amazing displays from VDV, Kulusevski, Johnson, Solanke, and another clean sheet—an away win, wow. Man U were down to 10 men by halftime via a slightly unfair red card on Bruno. I don’t want to get my hopes up yet, but it’s hard not to feel good. (You just know Spurs will kick you in the bollocks as soon as you get a hard-on, though.)

09: Away win vs Ferencváros (2-1, Europa)
Expected win even with a rotated squad. Nothing special, though.

10: Away loss vs Brighton (2-3)
As I predicted, as soon as you start to believe, Spurs kick you in the teeth. My gut said we’d lose—away to a decent team on a six-match win streak (against crap teams, though—that was the clue).
Spurs went 2-0 up in an excellent first half, with Brennan Johnson scoring six goals in six games. Second half, we came out lazy and arrogant, thinking we had it in the bag. Brighton came out firing and got three goals in 20 minutes. Our defense crumbled, mainly Udogie, but all were shite. Ange didn’t help by not subbing when the team looked beaten and knackered. Later, he said, ""No point in subs as the team weren’t up for it; they wouldn’t have made a difference."" Extraordinary attitude, ffs. He made a few crap subs with 10 minutes to go that couldn’t change anything. This is on the players and Ange. Devastating defeat. Back to hating this team of losers.

11: Home win vs West Ham (4-1)
First half was usual Spurs—Porro ball-watched their goal. We pulled one back before halftime, luckily. Second half, Ange took off Maddison tactically (he had an assist in the first half) and brought on Sarr, who is better defensively. It made a massive difference—three goals in seven minutes! Sonny was back in form, scoring beautifully one-on-one. Richarlison also returned from a long injury, playing the last 20 minutes. Unfortunately, Johnson didn’t get his seventh goal in seven matches. We’re now sixth but have played an extra game. Not getting hopes up, as West Ham were trash in midfield. A win is a win. Kulusevski played very well too—a lovely curling shot to score.

12: Europa League: Home win vs AZ (1-0)
Very boring to watch apart from promising bits of play from Mikey Moore—he might just be the real deal at only 17 years old! Timo still can’t finish; it’s now embarrassing for him and the club. Son was still out, but Richarlison and Odbert are now ready to play a part.

13: Away loss vs Palace (0-1)
Boring first half. Conceded yet again from an individual error (VDV this time). We had one or two chances, but they mostly blocked us in midfield. Mikey Moore started but was hardly involved, like most of our attack. Most frustrating match so far. The game stopped every 30 seconds. We gave up basically after we conceded a goal. Really disappointing. Back to the usual shit away form. Palace’s first win of the season, ffs—they desperately wanted it. We looked like we didn’t give a toss, to be honest. WTF?

14: Carabao Cup: Home win vs Man City (2-1)
Good match to watch. City had an injury crisis on top of playing mostly a B team, so I expected us to win at home, especially with our good recent history against them. We just scraped through courtesy of Timo’s first goal of the season (at last!) and a lovely bending long shot from outside the box by Sarr (his specialty). Bissouma cleared one off our goal line—otherwise, I’m sure we would’ve gone on to lose. A good display against weak opposition, but as usual, we could and should have done more. Still, we’re into the quarter-finals.

15: Home win vs Aston Villa (4-1)
First half: they were better than us in all areas. They scored from a corner, and we fluffed all our corners (big surprise). They limited us to long shots. Second half: Son delivered a lovely cross for a typical back-post finish by Brennan Johnson. Ange subbed off Son soon after, and everyone was angry at him. But then Solanke finally scored his first Spurs goal—just onside—and my bet was up (2-1 to Spurs). I went to make a coffee before cashing out, came back, and that twat Solanke had scored again! 3-1 Spurs. Then, in extra time, a beautiful bending free kick from Maddison ended the game 4-1. A stunning second half.
Now we have a Europa match against Galatasaray and then relegation fodder Ipswich before the international break. Anything could happen—it’s Spurs, after all. Happy today, though.

16: Europa League: Away loss vs Galatasaray (2-3)
We didn’t need a result here, really, so it was mostly a rotated, tired squad. Forster in goal looked sluggish (not surprising as he hasn’t played in years and is about 37), though he made some very good saves in the second half. Dragusin had a nightmare match, like most of the team—he couldn’t string a decent pass together. First half was an embarrassment. They pressed us big time, but we kept trying to play out from the back and got caught almost every time. Their defense was weak—Davinson Sanchez, remember him?—but we only had one shot on goal in the first half and scored with it (very unusual for Spurs). However, we let in two. Archie Gray looked okay, considering. Solanke got two goals and did very well, but apart from that, it was a match to forget. I wouldn’t read much into it.

17: Home loss vs Ipswich (1-2)
We could have gone third with a win. Went 0-2 down by halftime, all through bad defending. Dragusin scored an own goal—embarrassing, as Ipswich hadn’t won a PL game this season. We always do this. No Spurs player escapes a bollocking today—it was truly pathetic. Bentancur scored our goal with a very nice header, but other than that, he was shite. I am back to hating this bunch of millionaire losers. How can we beat City and Villa in the same week and lose to the second or third-worst team in the Prem—and at home?

She has a habit of shit talking the main manager and saying how lazy she is (granted she’s not completely wrong but that’s a different story) and she herself has been 2 1/2 hours late to just after saying she’d be “a little late”. She has also brought in her boyfriend’s children and left half way through that shift to go drive them to a different town. Shes also bragged about getting a DUI and speeding 140mph. Well I’ve had enough and complained about open not being good and she’s decided to tell everyone else I should tell her that directly.

One of the items is already prepped it just needs to cool down, and the other Is literally pouring concentrate and water. You have the whole shift to do it” and that shut her down. 

Today’s incident: She came into my shift today and not even 5 min in or as much as a hello got pissed that i wrote on the board to not leave tip cup with money outside over night and to clean the steam wand tips at close. “You don’t have to write everything I do wrong with close on the board.” I was immediately getting angry because of the constant attitude and she didn’t even say hello first.
I said “you like to say to everyone that i need to tell you and you’ve said to leave a note for closers when they mess up”
She immediately got defensive and rude and tried to bait me into arguing with her saying I’m being rude and I said what she had said to me before. Now when I get really angry the breath just leaves me and it’s hard to speak. So I tried stepping away and she said “what are you going to go cry?”
I said “no I’m trying not to p*unch you in the fucking face” 
She tried being condescending and said “well why don’t you go back and collect yourself” 
I told her “I’m not working the rest of the shift with you. You need to grow the fuck up and do your job. I’m done talking to you, high school left 4 years ago and you need to learn how to grow the fuck up and be an adult.”
She tried talking more shit but I gave her the “enough close your mouth I’m done” and put my hand up to shush her.

1gv7jik,https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/1gv7jik/the_oldage_question_cellular_or_gpsonly/,The Old-Age Question: Cellular or GPS-only?,"Hello folks,

This question has been asked many times, but I am curious to your advice in my situation. After years of eyeballing one, but thinking I don't need one, I am seriously debating buying an Apple Watch (10). Of course, the cellular version is the most feature-rich. However, it's also the most expensive and drains the battery quicker. Is it worth it in my use case?

My main reasons for considering an Apple Watch:

* **Knowing the time without hassle or distractions**. I hate pulling out my phone, distractions included, just to see the time and would love to just have a watch face telling me it. Major benefit when catching the train in hurry or just having a relaxing walk in town.

* **Keeping track of my daily steps while being offline**. Often times, I take my phone with me just to have my steps recorded. Having an Apple Watch would mean I could get the groceries, have a walk or go to a friend without the need to have my phone and be distracted by it (which happens often). 

* **Being a daily motivator to exercise.** Sure, the iPhone already has ways to keep track of my activity and shows me rings. And that genuinely helps quite a bit already. But having an Apple Watch would even more stimulate me to exercise more with the sleek rings, extra data, dedicated workout modes etc. Also, my iPhone is not suitable for keeping track of cycling or playing soccer.

* **Keeping track of my sleep and other health data**. I would be very interested to see how my sleep health is doing and I also would be interested in my heart rate, saturation, etc. every now and then.

* **Setting timers.** I really look forward to this feature, as it seems much more convenient than searching for my phone just to set a timer for the pasta water. It would also allow me to set Pomodoro timers without needing to bring my phone or laptop - distraction-free!

* **Having my to-do lists everywhere**. I already use Things 3 on my iPhone, but having it on my Apple Watch means I can leave my phone at home when doing groceries and ticking off products just on my watch. And I am able to see my schedule for tomorrow faster.

**In short, a device that improves my quality-of-life in core life areas (timekeeping, health, productivity) while distracting me less than a phone would.**

All these things are perfectly doable with a GPS-only watch for the way I use them, for the most parts. Things I might personally miss: 

* **Navigation** **without my phone.** I don't think I will use this feature often, because I don't go to completely new places often, let alone without my phone. But it feels really freeing and tech-savvy to be able to go to new places without my phone nearby. 

* **Being able to call when having time away from my phone**. Most of the time I would leave my phone home, I could perfectly do without calling or texting someone. But sometimes when doing groceries for my family (I live alone), I need to call to make sure I am buying the right thing for them, or when I'm out to play soccer I need to call or text someone. In these situations I would now use my phone and having a GPS-only version means I would still need to take my phone with me in those situations. However, I can't imagine talking to a watch in a supermarket would be really convenient anyways (I don't have AirPods).

However, the majority of times when I'm out-and-about, I am carrying my phone because often I am going outside to do freelance work in a local coffee shop. I would always carry my phone with me in those situations because it functions as my hotspot (open wi-fi is often not that reliable and I have unlimited data). Also, I take quite a lot of pictures with my phone, also outdoors. So it's only for those moments I want to feel offline and a little more alone, yet would want to have a back-up connected device just-in-case. A cellular Apple Watch would cost me twice as much though when counting in the extra monthly fees as well.

I went to a coffee shop I liked and got free coffee. I was a little worried kasi yung binigay na free wasn't what I'd typically get but I loved it still! 
Naglunch ako after and was initially planning on going to Nanyang kaso walang available table, wandered around and ended up at a Chinese resto that had affordable roasted duck (my fave). It did not disappoint!
Met up with a friend na inaya ako mag coffee since I treated them last time. Had a nice time catching up tapos nakita din namin other friends namin so nagspontaenous dinner kami.
Medyo madami tao sa pinuntahan namin but we decided to wait and we had an amazing meal plus caught up on a lot of things.

Five years ago, I was depressed. No friends to turn to kasi the people I had back then made me feel like I was a burden, despite me always showing up when they needed me.
Now, people check in on me and constantly express how much they appreciate me. I genuinely love the people I have in my life.

I'm trying to redo/conslidate and start in 2025 with November/December possibly being a test or building out to hit the ground running in 2025. I usually review every few years and sometimes annually to see if something is working it's cleaner that way. Not opposed to a new quicken file but don't really want to as I love the history and don't think it's necessary either I recently started hiding categories I no longer use or never used...gee, like rules, why didn't I think of that! lol

Long time quicken user of over 20 years with current file going back to 2006. I like Quicken and use Quicken for Mac. I used to use the KISS theory but it has growing and evolved over time with my analytical mind where I'm growing Split Fatigue. I have a family now and even though I love tags, the introduction of tags have semi complicated matters for my mind. :p Still like them though. I like the idea of budgeting and actually tried it this year but never really reviewed it (only sometimes) and instead use projected balances in quicken and bills entered in for budgeting.

This is why I was looking at other apps to simplify everything but then when I try them, the apps suck, don't work or missing tons of data. Quicken has been ol reliable with amazing data. But at the end of the day, I don't really do anything with those reports other than do comparisons of years, or spending throughout the year or my favorite, net worth over the years. It was nice to see how much we've been spending on toys for little man the past few months lol Saying hey, we probably should cut back, especially with Christmas coming up.

Sub-categories in parentheses.

Here's my current setup:  
Auto (Auto Insurance, Auto Payment (Formally renamed lease), Gas, Mileage (reimbursement), Parking, Public Transportation, Registration, Service & Parts, Tolls). Note: Tolls, Parking, PT don't happen as frequently as they did.  
\- Bills & Utilities (Garbage & Recycling, Gas & Electric, Internet, Mobile Phone, Television, Water)  
Note: Within mobile phone we have device payments, with cell on iPad and watches, which I've broken down for years but I'm thinking, do I need to do that and just lump it all under mobile phone?)  
\- Cash & ATM  
\- Education  
\- Fees & Charges (Bank Charge, Interest Exp) - This don't happen anymore but still there just in case.  
\- Gifts Given  
\- Groceries ( Recently re-added Alcohol back to his. Also thinking about adding in toiletries and other products that get bought at the store.) Problem is, we do a lot of shopping at Target, Costco, & Meijer which can cover multiple categories.  
\- Health & Fitness (Dentist, Doctor, Eyesore, Health Insurance, Medicine/Drugs (Probably change to prescriptions)  
\- Home Insurance  
\- Household - Catchall category - Furnishes, supplies, OTC medicines (used to break this out too), beauty supplies (didn't track, then did and now back here), toiletries, cleaning supplies, tools, lawn & garden). Debating on breaking out. Was thinking of waiting until we buy a house to break out for Home maintenance & repairs, etc.  
\- Kids (Baby Supplies, Babysitter & Daycare, Kids Activities, Toys) I struggle sometimes here. Toddler is in pull-ups but categorize those purchases in baby supplies.  
\- Loans (Loan Interest, Loan Payment) Only use LI  
\- Meals & Entertainment -Just as it is. I've loosely struggled on whether or not to break this one out over the years. On one had it's great, don't have to worry about breaking out if you go to a game, bowling, pool, buy a random hotdog, buy a bagel at the coffee shop, etc.  I've also added certain kid actives in here too like indoor playground and birthday parties, etc. I just tag the big ticket items or if I send my SO a $25 Starbucks gift card. A part of me kind of wants to create categories and breakout but then I can just run reports too.....I do use tags for any vacation and trips though. Would it be cool to track coffee shops and coffee, yea, but then I can just run reports or look at the category spend....  
\- Misc  
\- Not Sure  
\- Personal Care (Hair)  
\- Pets  
\-Rent  
\- Significant Other Name for her expenses.  
\- Shopping (Books, Clothing, Electronics & Software, Hobbies, Movies, Music, Sporting Goods) Thinking  
about consolidating this one too.

I tried breaking out Alcohol and Beauty categories and did that for 4 years before moving them back to their OG Groceries and Household categories a few weeks ago. Made a backup before doing so.

As the title says, we are getting close to the big day! (FINALLY) This is my second child and I did not have a partner with my first birth (3.5 years now). I, my family, friends, etc only focused on me because Dad hadn't come into the picture. (Long, not fun story)

ANYWAY. My partner has been nothing short of amazing. He has been working extra hard to bring in more income so that I can have more time off. He comes to every appointment with our midwife. He cleans my home often. He rubs my body, cooks, helps with my child by making lunches for school, reading bedtime stories, painting nails...I could go on. He has proactively signed us up for classes...Again I could go on but you get the point.

Everybody in our lives are constantly asking about what I need. Which is amazing, and I am so happy to have so much support from my family and his. However, I do not know what he needs. When I ask, he always says he doesn't need anything except for me to be healthy and his family to be happy or something along those lines. Some things I've thought about, but he vetoed:

* Concert tickets - he says no way, it's crunch time and he wants to be with me when he isn't at work
* I try to send him to his other house for a couple of nights of down time - says it's not that relaxing and he would rather be spending that time with us
* Ask his friends to come spend some time with us - they'll want to drink and be up all night and it's just not the time for that right now. We will have plenty of friend time later 

I'm at a loss. I've gotten him some gifts and reciprocate dinners, make sure he has fresh coffee. All small things but I really want him to know how appreciated he is. If you have suggestions, please let me know! I feel like a big useless dummy haha

I've been getting a lot of DMs lately asking about my Gorilla Sofa, especially after I posted that picture in my living room last week. So, I thought I'd share my experience and help you guys find the perfect one.

I spent weeks researching before buying my Gorilla Sofa, and let me tell you, it was worth every minute. These sofas are becoming super popular because they're basically indestructible (hence the name) and ridiculously comfortable. After trying out different furniture stores and getting disappointed with the prices and quality, I finally found an amazing deal online.

I actually bought mine from this link: https://athometouch.com/sofa. The prices there are way better than what I saw in local stores, and they often have some sweet deals going on.

What makes these sofas special is their heavy-duty construction. The frame is made with hardwood, and the upholstery is this super tough fabric that can handle pretty much anything - from kids jumping around to pets doing their thing. I've had mine for eight months now, and it still looks brand new despite my two cats using it as their personal scratching post (against my wishes, obviously).

The cushions are something else too. They're filled with high-density foam that doesn't lose its shape, even with daily use. Trust me, I'm a certified couch potato, and this thing still looks and feels as good as day one.

If you're thinking about getting one, here are some quick tips:
- Measure your space twice (learned this the hard way)
- Check the color swatches carefully
- Read the delivery terms
- Look for seasonal sales

I've seen these sofas go for ridiculous prices at some furniture stores, but you can get them for much less here: https://athometouch.com/sofa. They usually ship pretty fast too.

One thing I really appreciate is how easy it is to clean. Like, seriously easy. I spilled coffee on mine last week (classic me), and it wiped right off. The fabric is stain-resistant, which is a huge plus if you're clumsy like me or have kids around.

The assembly was straightforward too. It took me and my roommate about 30 minutes to put it together, and we're not exactly furniture assembly experts. The instructions were clear, and all the pieces lined up perfectly.

I honestly can't recommend these sofas enough. They're comfortable, durable, and actually look pretty stylish. Plus, the price point is really reasonable for what you're getting. If you're in the market for a new sofa that'll last for years, definitely check them out.

I was diagnosed with Sibo five years ago with both hydrogen and methane after a very, very stressful few months. 

I took many, many rounds of xifaxin and it did not do much for levels.

 I then did the carnivore diet, no luck.

 I then did the elemental powder diet and methane dropped off. 

I struggled again with hydrogen taking more xifaxin before I did the elemental diet again for 15 days. 

I am cured!

 I have gained 40 pounds and can eat most things, my stomach isn't in pain all the time and my bowels have control.

Sibo is miserable. 

The elemental diet combined with antibiotics finally kicked it. 

I would highly recommend this route, it isn't bad if you crush up the ice and blend it.

It really does appear that way, I personally couldn't tell that it was veneer... All sides of the boards are veneered, even the sides that aren't visible when the desk is setup (inside where the drawers are, etc.). There is zero evidence of seams on the edges - its very well done and the veneer is very thick. It's definitely an old ""they don't make them like this anymore"" type of veneered wood.

Its dinged and scratched and has marks everywhere from it's long life, and so i am currently in the process of 80grit sanding all the old hard finish off. Whatever it is takes a fair bit of elbow grease even with 80 grit disks on an orbital.

My question is about finishing. It will be a computer desk and it will definitely see some sweaty cups, hot mugs, possibly coffee spills and such. I'm very green to woodworking and especially furniture finishing. Currently I'm considering the hardwax oil route, as it seems to be super popular and beginner friendly. Are these finishes going to be strong enough to resist spills or is the only way to achieve that to go with a urethane? I also considered that if i use a butcher block oil/hardwax oil that is oil based and going to want to soak in - is it possible that the oil will soak through the veneer and release whatever glue is holding it down and cause the entire surface to delaminate?

Please educate me, reddit. I am open to any finishing suggestions, i'm not sure if such a product exists but ease of application in a dusty shop, and overall stain/scratch resistance are strong priorities.

1gv7au0,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1gv7au0/preventing_coffee_stains/,Preventing coffee stains ,"Is there anything else I can do to prevent (presumably) coffee from staining my teeth? My teeth are very prone to staining and it’s starting to get into little crevices of my teeth that my dentist cannot reach. 

Here are a few of the things I’ve tried:

1. Limit my coffee intake (I almost always have 1 cup per day. Maybe 2, but that’s fairly rare)
2. Drink water with/after my coffee
3. Get teeth cleaning every 4 months instead of every 6
4. Use a water pick and brush religiously (at least once in the morning and once when I get home from work and sometimes a third time before bed)

I tried using a straw a few times, but didn’t turn it into a habit. I will probably give that another try. I only brush at home. I have considered brushing my teeth at work too since that is where the majority of my coffee consumption occurs. My dentist also recommended chewing sugar free gum. Not sure if any of the above would help or not.

Is there anything else I can do? I don’t particularly like the taste of coffee. I just like it to get me going in the morning. Also we assume it’s because of coffee but I also have a protein powder smoothie that I usually have for breakfast during the workweek that I drink through a straw. Perhaps that is the primary contributor? I might give that up and keep with the coffee and see how the staining looks in 4 months.

I currently do not have a home setup, but after a recent trip to Europe, I neeeeeed something at home where I can make a proper espresso reliably. 

However, I'm a bit lazy, so I don't want anything too manual. At the same time, I want the option to experiment, so I want to stay away from super auto.

This has guided me to the Breville Barista Express Impress.

However, I've read from several reviews that the grinder is the weak link in the otherwise fairly strong chain that is the BBEI.

Is it possible to replace the ginder with something better and still have it integrated? I like the idea of the machine doing the grinding and dispensing and then being able to use the built-in tamper right away. I realize I could buy a separate grinder and tamp myself (or maybe even use the built-in tamper, as seen [in this video from Craft Coffee Spot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElpOx2aeWEc&t=181s)), but I would prefer to have it all in the same unit.

Does anybody have any recommendations for improving the built-in grinder on the Breville Barista Express Impress?

Score: 3/5 ,"In one of our more recent reviews, we were asked in the comment section to do a review of Sharis. We thought this would be a great idea to pay homage to a beloved diner that is going out of business due to apparently not understanding they have to pay taxes like the rest of us.

I have been going to Shari’s for over 20 years and have very fond memories of the establishment. It was the first place I witnessed someone drinking and gambling at 10:00am on a Sunday, the first place I experienced social anxiety waiting in the small lobby on a busy morning, and the first place I ever endured heartburn.

While we have been there many times, this review will be based upon the experience my partner and I had a number of years ago early on into our relationship.

In October of 2019, my partner and I had been a few months into our newly established relationship. We were still getting to know each other and were still trying to learn about things we liked and didn’t like. Around that time the movie Joker (won’t be seeing the second one) had come out in theaters which we had gone to see three separate times as we both felt we had a connection to the main character. After one of these movie nights, we left the theater feeling hungry. With limited options available that late at night, we decided to go to Shari’s as we hadn’t been there as a couple before. So, we hopped in the car, took turns practicing the scene where the Joker and Robert De Niro have an exchange before Joker shoots Robert, and headed to the Shari’s on south Commercial.

When we arrived at the restaurant, it was already dark but it was easy to tell that it wasn’t very busy. There weren’t many cars in the parking lot and looking through the various windows of the octagonal building, we could see there were very few people inside. As we walked towards the front doors, we had to scurry past a man in a trench coat that was digging through the ash tray on top of the trash can looking for cigarettes.

The inside of the building looked and smelled like an authentic diner. I could see the abundance of pies behind the counter and the smell of black coffee, breakfast food and a musky carpet that looked like it had only ever been cleaned with a carpet sweeper, holding onto 20 years of memories worth of stains. 

We sat on one of the benches for about 10 minutes even though we were the only ones waiting and there was a plethora of available seating. Eventually a waitress came up to us and asked if we wanted a table or a booth. At the time, I was indifferent to which type of seating I was given, but I had learned months later that this would change. I will go into more detail on that in our Red Lobster review. We chose booth seating and continued on with our experience.

The menu at Shari’s had always been visually appealing to me. They had a great variety of breakfast, lunch and dinner items that were accompanied by detailed pictures. If I go to a restaurant and they don’t have a picture of any of the food, I typically view that as a red flag. The only thing I didn’t like about the menus is that they displayed the total calories for each dish. While I wouldn’t consider myself a health nut, I do my best to at least be somewhat aware of what I am putting into my body. The meat lover's skillet was always my go-to and seeing that it contained over 1800 calories did not make me feel good about myself or my decisions.

I ordered the meat lovers skillet w/ pancakes and iced tea (to cut down on calories) and my partner ordered the two-egg Denver Omelette since she is a Broncos fan. The wait for the food was short which was great because we had both worked up an appetite trying to see who could imitate the joker's laugh the best. The meat lovers skillet as always was amazing. The mix of meat, potatoes, eggs was perfect and had a great texture and the hot sauce I added elevated the quality of the dish. The pancakes were fluffy and came with a heaping scoop of butte
r that went well with the maple syrup. Over the course of my meal, I had to order 2 refills of my ice tea due to the sheer volume of food that comes with the meat lover's skillet. My partner said her omelette was good but that the fruit that came in the fruit cup as a side wasn’t very fresh. I tried making several fruit cup jokes but my partner didn’t fully understand my humor at the time.

We finished up our meal and contemplated buying some pie to go while we were cashing out. After not being able to decide for a few minutes and noticing a growing line of customers behind us, we decided to opt out of the pie. We walked out of the building to the smell of cigarettes, the man from before that was going through the ashtray seemed to have found a winner and decided to light up right next to the front door.

All in all, while Shari’s was never the absolute best diner, I do think it was a fairly decent place. The food was consistent and being open 24 hours was great as we knew we could always go there for a decent meal at any given time. I feel I can speak for the pacific northwest in saying that Shari’s will be missed, just not for very long.

In Canada, it’s really easy to order coffee from fast food chains for the sole reason that their cream and sugar are pre measured BASED ON CUP SIZE. 

I ordered a “2 cream and 2 sugar” coffee in the US and to my surprise, the coffee tasted like there was only a teaspoon of sugar in there. 

This also extends to other coffee shops like Dunkin Donuts btw. 

So to simulate the taste of a “2 cream 2 sugar” for a large coffee from McDonald’s Canada, I had to add 5 or 6 sugars and creams on the app.

I’m stepping into this community during a time of transition and healing in my life. I’m currently in the tail-end process of leaving a relationship, which has been a tough but necessary decision. Through this, I’ve been leaning on my faith more than ever and trusting that God has a greater plan for me.

Even though life feels a little messy right now, I’ve never been more certain about my purpose: to love, be loved, and bring life and joy into this world. My heart is ready to move forward, and I want to meet someone who shares my faith and values....a person who sees the beauty in building a God-centered relationship.

A little about me: I’m a small business owner. I love spending time outdoors, trying out new recipes, and diving into Scripture with my morning coffee. I’m also someone who believes in honest communication, shared purpose, and approaching life with gratitude and grace.

I know starting fresh might seem soon, but I feel ready to embrace what God has in store for me next. If this resonates with you, I’d love to connect.",9,1732048249.0,ChristianDating,4,1.0,False

I (f) have 2 older sisters (28 & 24) and currently i am in a fight with my oldest sister. We have never had a good sister relationship because of what she put me through as a child. My sister slapped me when i was 8 and one more time, but I don't know how old i was at the time. She also once put me in a cold shower and wouldn't let me out despite my screaming an pledding to let me out. It is important to mention that I can't drink warm drinks, such as coffee or tea because i will puke if i drink this, i don't know why, but my family knows about this. So when I was little she told me to sit and put a cup of tea in fornt of me. (This was the only time that my other sister was also present) She told me that i wasn't allowed to leave the table until i drank all of it, despite knowing that i was gonna be sick. No matter how long i begged her not to make me, she wouldn't let me get up, until i drank it all. I was around 10 at the time (+- a 1,2 years i don't remember exactly), she was around 18/19. 

When i told my father about the slapping he dismissed me with the words : ""Your sister wouldn't do that"" and that was it. Until 3 days ago when my father the sister (28) and i were having dinner  and we talk about what we went through and when my sister talked about what a good person she was i wasn't having it anymore. I told her everthing she put me through. At that point i was crying because years of silence broke and i was finally talking about what she had done. She started crying and jumped up screamed at me, that if she ever slapped me i would have deserved that and ran home. 

When she was gone i looked at my father and all he had to say was ""You don't need to look at me at all"" and i was heartbroken. She finaly admitted what she did to me and that was his response? The next day when i fighted with him again he told me after some pressuring that ""no child should go through that"", but he couldn't even say ""your sister had no right to put you through this"" and now he wants nothing to do with what is going on with me and her. It is also important to note that she was always his favourite daugher, her feelings matterd when mine didn't and he would always make excuses for her and do everything for her, even if she could do it herself. Now he doesn't want to be involved in the things happening right now. 

There is one more thing i want to write, my oldest sister is really sensitive and she can't take anything, she will be emotional and jump and run away instead of talking and solving problems. Now it is an unwritten rule in my family that whenever we are in a fight or something bad is happending we never tell our grandma because she has some health issues and will only worry. But today i heard from my other sister that the oldest went crying to our grandma and telling her how my words hurt her. (Keep in mind she was the one to slap me and now she is the one hurt from my words?) She somehow always was the favourite child because my granny wrote my middel sister that i should apologize to her because it is all in the past and i hurt her so much. 

I even involved my stepmother to see if we can figure some things out in terms of family gatherings and stuff. I did that, because i wouldn't punish those around us and she declined for whatever reason. 

I am writing this because i would like to hear some opinios on this because all i want to do is never see her again. I am heartbroken to hear these kind of things from my family and the only one who has my back is my middle sister. So AITA?

1gv6vqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sasquatch_Nazi/comments/1gv6vqv/hunting_monster_sasquatch_with_my_buddy_boss_nr/,"Hunting Monster Sasquatch With My Buddy, Boss N****r ","I awoke at the crack of 3:30 pm on that fateful morning, April 27, 2020. I had been up all night, and most of the morning, training my new 20 year old Mexican housekeeper on the skills she needs to effectively perform her job. After stuffing her taco several times and serving up some hot cheese dip all over her assets, I fell asleep. 

When I awoke the first thing I did was reach for my cell phone to check for any incoming messages. I had 10 missed calls and several voice mails. They were all from my old buddy, Hawg Leg. He is an associate of mine in the Bigfoot field. 

It seems that old Hawg Leg went out to investigate a Sasquatch report on his own and got himself into a right messy situation. I gave the sumbitch a call and spoke to him about it. It seems that he has a neighbor, Miss Rita, who has been getting nightly visits from a creature. 

It started off rather mundane, with slaps on the outside walls of the house, some howls and huffing noises, and missing chickens. Then the animal got brazenly aggressive and started peeking in her front porch windows at night. But it was when it started fiddling with the door knobs and clawing on the doors that Ms. Rita started fearing for her safety. She was afraid the creature may get into her house. 

She called ole Hawg Leg to come over, telling him there had been some prowlers on her property. But when he got to her house she broke down crying and told Hawg Leg what was really going on. She had seen the creature. 

One night old Rita was expecting a visitor, you see. She works two jobs, one as a waitress at the local Waffle House and the other as a rural mail carrier. But she still has a hard time making ends meet. So she kind of put out the word that she was available as “company” for men in exchange for pay. 

This one night she had an old feller down the way stopping by around 10:00 pm to spend some time with her. It was good old Leroy Perkins who worked on a nearby dairy farm. Well, at about 10:30 pm that night there came a rattling on her front door, so she just assumed it was ole Leroy, late as usual and probably too drunk to find the door bell. She was annoyed because he was late, but she knew he would have the cash, so she went to the front door to let him in. 

Rita unlocked her door and whipped it open, expecting to find the old farmer standing there. Instead, she found herself looking into the eyes of a hellish monster! It was standing on the edge of her porch hunched over so it could fit under the porch roof. She said it was as wide as a car, covered in jet black hair, had a ape-like build, and the face of pure evil. It’s eyes were black. She said it looked like it had no soul. It just stood there looking at her, and emitting a hoarse breathing noise. Then she noticed something else. It had an erection. It had a HUGE erection! 

The monster stood no more than 4 feet from her. She screamed, slammed the door, locked it, then ran into her bedroom. She retrieved a pistol from her nightstand and stood there in terror, quiet and listening. She said she stood there in silence for what seemed an eternity, shaking uncontrollably. Suddenly there was a loud thud against her house, outside her bedroom wall, followed by a low, guttural growl she could hear outside. At that point she went into hysterics. Nothing else happened after that.

The next day, as soon as the sun came up, she packed some clothes and left. She holed up at a friend’s house. Her friend knew Hawg Leg too, from a while back when he discreetly took care of a problem for her, so she called him to come over. 

According to ole Hawg Leg, Ms. Rita was super freaked out and had to be sedated. He decided to go over to her property and investigate. He found 3 well-formed footprints around Rita’s house that he estimated being 18 inches in length and 9 inches across the widest portions. 

Hawg Leg decided that he needed some heavy heat to go up against this beast, so he called me. I told him I would throw my shit together and be there by sunset. Old Hawg Leg was to remain on the property until I arrived. 

Now normally, I would assemble my A-Team. But I was a little short-handed at the moment. Old Big Dick was laid up in the hospital with the Corona Virus (what a pussy!). Black Shade got pinched for not paying his child support. Roscoe had disappeared. And good old Murder went and got himself killed in an armed robbery. So it was just going to be me and Hawg Leg on this Squatch Op. 

I started to look for my shit, but it was not where it should be. “What the hell?!?”, I thought. I went to my gun cabinet and ... NOTHING! What the fuck was going on?!? I yelled for Maria, my illegal housekeeper and jizz receptacle, but she was gone too. I put 2 and 2 together and came to the conclusion that the bitch had ripped me off! “GODDAMNIT!”, I thought to myself, “Never fall asleep with a b##ner in your house. Son of a bitch!!” 

Fortunately, the dumb bitch did not know about my secret stash. I grabbed my .45-70 lever action and my old .480 revolver and shoulder rig and headed out, cussing that bitch Maria all the way to my truck. I was going to have to deal with her treachery when I got finished dusting this Sasquatch. I ended up having to use my fly fishing vest to hold my fucking ammo because she even stole my goddamned tactical vest! 

I arrived at the coordinates at 8:00 pm sharp, just before sunset. Old Hawg Leg was there standing by his truck. He greeted me with “Hey there, General. How’s it going?” I noticed immediately that he was not packing as I strolled up to him, armed to the teeth and ready to murder a Bigfoot. I asked “Where the fuck are your guns, Hawg Leg?” 

Old Hawg Leg started telling me that he had been doing some reading on the inter-webs about how killing a Bigfoot is wrong because they are basically a tribe of primative man, and that killing one would be murder. So he decided he couldn’t kill one of these creatures. 

After a brief pause to allow the absurdity of the situation sink in, I took the butt of my rifle stock and violently slammed it into old Hawg Leg’s face as hard as I could. He went down like a sack of potatoes, blood spraying everywhere and spitting out teeth. I said “YOU STUPID F#GGOT!! GET YOUR GODDAMN GUNS AND LET’S GET SET UP!!” Hawg Leg was holding his smashed-in face in his hands, blood and tears streaming down, but he finally pulled himself together, got his rifle from behind the seat of his truck, and followed me to the wood line. 

The property consisted of a small house that sat on approximately an acre of open land, surrounded on 3 sides by wood lines that led into deep woods. I told old Hawg Leg to hunker down inside one corner of the wood line behind the house while I did the same on the opposite corner. Soon thereafter the sun set and nighttime crept down on us. 

Nothing much happened that evening. But there was an eerie quiet around us. There was no insect noise, nor were any nocturnal creatures stirring.  Clearly, something was up, and it was entirely consistent with having a Sasquatch in the area. However, despite the tension in the air, nothing occurred. 

At 5:00 am I decided to call it a night. I walked out of the tree line and signaled for Hawg Leg to meet me at my truck. Old Hawg leg felt the tension too. We strongly suspected a beast in the area and were perplexed by the lack of activity. 

We were standing at the back of my truck, which was parked next to Hawg Leg’s flat-bed, just off the road in front of Ms. Rita’s house. As we were talking about what our next move would be, suddenly there came a crashing sound in the woods from where we just came. It was loud and wild. It sounded like a tank was coming through the woods, minus the mechanical noise. Shocked, we turned toward the woods. It was clearly moving in our direction! 

Just before whatever was plowing recklessly through the woods hit the wood line, it let loose with a deafening, unholy roar that sounded like something straight out of the pits of Hell! Both Hawg Leg and I recoiled in horror at the sound. 

Now, I have been roared at by big Sasquatch before. But this time was different. First, it was LOUD and LONG. The animal emitting such an infernal sound had to have lungs like a hot air balloon. This meant it was HUGE. Second, it was not merely a roar. To call it a simple roar would not do justice to it. It was a ferocious battle cry! 

Then we saw it. It came busting through the wood line and headed straight for us. It was charging!! And it was coming FAST! In just a blink of an eye it was on top of us. I had gone to one knee to steady myself for a shot with my rifle. Old Hawg Leg broke down like a big, fat pussy, then tucked tail, and went running in the opposite direction. 

That fucker moved so damn fast. It was uncanny. I was only able to squeeze off 2 shots before it reached my location. I don’t think I even hit it. If I did hit it, it showed absolutely no sign of it. Then it was over; it was right on top of my position!! I was fucked!!

The beast was massive. It was at least 12 feet tall and 5-6 feet across at the shoulders. It was covered in dark hair and moved on 2 legs. It was built like a fucking brick shit house, with bulging muscles. It’s eyes were as black as coal and it was huffing and grunting as it approached. 

Right before it reached my location it dropped down on all fours, making it resemble an ape. It literally propelled itself forward with its huge, muscular arms. Then, as I knew I was about to be ripped into pieces, the damnedest thing happened.

It kept running, on all fours, and passed by me, passing just 5 feet to my left as I was still on one knee. Despite my gunfire, it was not focused on me at all. Instead, it focused in on old Hawg Leg running off. I quickly stood and looked behind me just as the monster leapt upon Hawg Leg, knocking him to the ground on the other side of the road in front of Rita’s house. 

In the pale moonlight I could make out the red  spray of blood emitted from Hawg Leg’s neck as the beast ripped off his head. Old Hawg Leg’s body hit the ground as the beast held his head in its right hand. The beast held up the severed head and looked at it, as if it was admiring its work. Then it slowly turned its head and body to look at me. I swear the damned thing was grinning at me. 

I immediately raised my rifle and placed my sights on its head. But in the split second between putting the creature in my sights and pulling the trigger, it disappeared into the wood line across the road. Gone... just like that. It did not make a sound. 

I don’t know why the beast did not maul me instead of Hawg Leg. I also did not know what it’s game was. Was it gone? Did it move away after re-entering the woods across the street from the house? Or, was it still there, watching me? 

One thing was for sure: I was in a bad situation. I had no idea where the monster was. I decided that a retreat was in order, so I jumped in my truck and hauled ass away from there, keeping my eyes on the rear view mirror expecting to see that beast jump out at any moment. But it never did. 

I drove to the nearest town, about a half hour away. I stopped at the local Waffle House, went inside, and sat there drinking coffee for the next hour, and trying to decide what my next move would be. At sunrise I left and returned to the scene to get rid of what was left of Hawg Leg’s body. 

When I arrived I was already halfway expecting the body to be gone. Therefore, I was not at all surprised to see it gone with no trace of blood anywhere. The sneaky bastard had taken the body, either to conceal it or eat it. I made a phone call and arranged to have old Hawg Leg’s flat bed truck hauled off. 

Then I left. I knew that I needed reinforcements to deal with this bastard. It was just way too dangerous to take on by myself. It would be suicide. But I had a plan, a proverbial “ace in the hole”. I had to go see a man. But he was not just any man. He is the very definition of “BAD ASS”.
——————————————————

I called my man. He was down for the gig and was going to meet me back out at Ms. Rita’s property at sundown tonight. With my bud lined up, I had no doubt that this would be the night we send that hairy fuck back to hell. 

At around noon I decided to drive over to see Ms. Rita at her friend’s house. Upon knocking on the door I was greeted by a very nice looking, well-kept, 40-ish looking MILF. “Are you Ms. Rita?”, I asked. Turned out it wasn’t; it was her friend. But she ushered me inside when I told her I was Hawg Leg’s associate and that I was there to help. 

She took me into the parlor where I found poor Ms. Rita, sitting alone and eyes red from crying. Her friend announced my presence, “Rita, honey, this man is here to see you. He says he knows Hawg Leg. His name is “The General.” Rita started to rise but I motioned her to stay seated. Clearly she was in a bad way. 

Now, even though Rita’s emotions had been ripped apart by her terrifying encounter, I could not get past her beauty. Hawg Leg told me she had been whoring herself out to make ends meet. I could see why too. She could make a fortune with that tight little body on her! Both Rita and her friend were smoking hot. My mind began to wonder, drifting into prurient and clouded fantasies about box munching and 3-ways. Then Rita’s friend jerked me back into the moment.

“So, where are we at with the Investigation? Did you go out to Rita’s house?”, asked the friend. I told them that I had been there just hours before and that I had an up-close encounter with the monster. This news brought both women to the edge of their seats. I told them what went down. I left out the part about old Hawg Leg getting his head ripped off and blood spewing everywhere on account of the tender sensibilities in the room. 

I explained that I had just this morning employed a real badass to assist me in killing this beast, and that I am certain it will be dead after tonight. Both women looked pleased and relieved. Then the friend asked about old Hawg Leg. “Will he be out there tonight too? I’d really like to thank him”, she said. 

I shook my head, to which the friend’s expression took a dour turn. “What’s wrong? Is Hawg Leg Ok?”, the friend asked. Then I spilled the beans as gently as I could. “That sumbitch is dead as fuck, sweetheart. When the beast charged us, old Hawg Leg tucked tail and ran like a pussy! He got his head ripped clean off and died a most horrible, bloody, and gore-filled death imaginable”, I said. 

The friend looked in horror to Rita. Then she turned to me, smiled, and said “good”. A perplexed look entered my face, which caused the friend to explain. “You see, old Hawg Leg did me a favor a while back. But then the sumbitch started blackmailing me, saying he would turn me in for the crime he committed on her behalf.”  “That’s terrible”, I said, “I had no idea.” 

Then, without me asking, she went on to explain further. I said “Really, honey, I don’t need to know the details”, but she continued. It seems that old Hawg Leg’s kink was something called “pegging”. I was unfamiliar with this term, so I asked her to explain. Then Rita jumped in and enthusiastically explained it in graphic detail, telling me that when she entertains johns, 9 times out of 10 they want her to strap on and peg them. “Hell, it does not even feel like whoring when I am the one wearing the strap-on”, said Rita. 

Frankly, I was shocked. I had no idea that deep down all these old time farmers were a bunch of f#gs. The women saw the look of bewilderment on my face. I slowly sat down on the couch, a couple feet away from Rita. She said “Oh, come on, it does not necessarily mean they are f#gs ...”, but I motioned her to stop. 

Seeing my uneasiness, Rita scooted up close to me on the couch and took my right hand in both of hers. Then the friend sat down on the other side of me, places her arm around my back and started rubbing the back of my neck. The friend said “Come on, General, it’s ok. Even if 90% of farmers ARE f#gs, what’s it to you?”. I looked over at her. The first thing I noticed were her bare legs. The skirt she was wearing had hiked way up when she sat down. Raising my head I then noticed her titties, the tops of which were bare and exposed by the plunging neckline on her shirt. 

I then realized that my cock was rock hard. I felt like I could stick it through a fucking brick wall! Rita must have seen it because the next thing I know I feel her stroking my erection through my pants. I started making out with the friend as Rita stroked me. It was not long thereafter that Rita had my cock out and was eagerly going down on me. By this point, I had pulled her friend on top of me. My left hand was up her skirt, where I had pushed her panties aside and I was using my fingers to rub her clit and periodically plunge them deep inside of her to her moans of pleasure. 

Suffice it to say that the 3 of us engaged in some hot and heavy, and very, very nasty fucking the rest of the afternoon. I dumped my last load up Rita’s ass just after 7:30 pm. And God help me, I think I was completely dry after that. But, the fun had to come to an end because I had to get to Rita’s property by sundown to dust that Sasquatch. 

“Ok, bitches, I got to go to work. Ya’ll go ahead and finish each other off while I get ready to go”, I said. Both of them wanted to come with me, but I told them it was too dangerous. Then Rita started begging and her friend fondled my balls. Then I thought, “What the hell? I’m never going to see these two whores again, so who cares if they get their heads ripped off?” I told them they could both come, but it was getting late so they needed to hurry the fuck up and get dressed! 

All 3 of us were piled into the front seat of my pickup truck. Rita blew me as I drove us out to her place while her friend ate her out from behind. The stench of sex filled the air. Then I filled Rita’s mouth with goo right as I was pulling into her driveway. 

We took a moment to compose ourselves then got out of my truck. “Where’s your friend”, asked Rita. I told her he would be here at sundown. I looked at  my watch, then the sky, then silently acknowledged to myself the truth of the matter: my buddy is late. The motherfucker is always late. It is the one annoying thing about him. He is never fucking on time for anything. 

Then we heard something from down the road. It was quickly getting louder. We heard the bass from the woofers before we even heard his straight-piped turbo diesel engine. My buddy was finally here. 

He pulled up in a jacked-up, jet black Ford F-350 turbo diesel pickup truck. The music and thumping sound coming from its sound system was deafening. You could not see inside the cab of the truck because the windows are tinted black (and because they are too high up off the ground). 

Before he got to the house I’d say he was probably going over 100mph. He hit the e-brake about 1/4 mile from Rita’s house and then drifted sideways the remainder of the distance to her driveway. The controlled recklessness of such a move startled Rita and her friend, so they closed in tight to me. 

The jacked-up truck stopped right in front of us. I guided the girls around to the driver’s side, with one bitch on each arm. The truck shut off, the driver’s door opened, and there he was. He just coolly and casually drifted down from the cab of the truck, even though it sat at near nosebleed height. 

There he stood. 6’8”, 240 pounds of solid muscle, custom made jungle camo leather suit, alligator hide boots, and a black Stetson hat. The girls gasped at the sight of such a manly creature. Rita’s friend whispered “Who is THAT?”. I said “That is Boss. Boss N#gger”.
__________________________________________

Now, people get the wrong idea about me all the time: They falsely accuse me of being racist all the time because I use words like “n#gger” and hold a lot of far right political views. But nothing could be further from the truth. I love everyone. Hell, old Boss N#gger insists on being called “Boss N#GGER”; he says it’s part of his name. There’s nothing racist about it at all. It’s just who he is. 

After Boss N#gger got down out of his truck, he casually took off his driving gloves (everything Boss N#gger does he does casually), looked at me and the girls, then asked “What the fuck is with the bitches, Bud? I thought we were here to bump a Sasquatch.” I replied “Hell, Boss N#gger, I just been fucking these two whores all day, and they wanted to tag along. Besides, this bitch here is Rita. This is her place.” Boss N#gger nodded in understanding. 

I had already briefed Boss N#gger on what went down last night on the property. We decided to do the same thing me and old Hawg Leg did: Take up positions inside the wood line, then in the early morning hours we would walk back to our trucks out in the open. If that sumbitch is still here, then maybe it will show itself again and try to run us out of its territory. 

It was already dark and we were running behind since Boss N#gger adheres strictly to Colored People’s Time (CPT). I grabbed my guns and Boss N#gger grabbed his: A Barrett .50 BMG semi-auto rifle chopped down to the size of a carbine, and a sawed off, highly illegal, short-barreled, double barely 12 gauge shot gun as a sidearm. I gave Boss N#gger a walkie-talkie and then we headed out. 

We told the bitches to go into Rita’s house and lock the doors. Meanwhile, we took up positions behind the house inside the wood line and waited. Like the prior night, a thick layer of tension hung heavily in the air. The woods were silent. There was no Sasquatch action. 

At midnight I heard the first noise: it was a “Pop” sound followed by a “Psssst”. It came from Boss N#gger’s position. Then I heard something that sounded like wrapping paper, followed by a crunching sound. I raised my .45-70 and pulled back the hammer. Then I whispered into my walker-talkie, “Boss N#gger. Do you hear that noise? What’s going on down there?”

Boss N#gger replied “Fuck, General, they ain’t nuffin a’goin’ on down this way. Shit. I am just having me a little snack.” I paused and then asked him what he was snacking on. He replied “I gots me some leftover fried chicken and a bottle of grape soda.” I grimaced and said to myself “motherfucker!”, then I calmed myself by remembering the old adage: you can take a man out of the ghetto, but you will never take the ghetto out of a man.

At this point you may be asking yourself: how the hell did The General ever get mixed up with this here Boss N#gger character? Well, I’m going to tell you. It was back in 1993 or thereabouts and I was at an illegal cock fight doing some gambling. Old Boss N#gger ran the show. But most of the time while the cock fighting was going on he was out back in the trailers whoring bitches. 

This one particular night a scuffle broke out because some good old boys thought the event was fixed. They got all rowdy, then they pulled their guns. Someone ran out back and got Boss N#gger. Old Boss came out there and whipped their asses, all of them. As he and his boys were throwing them out, the good old boys swore they would be back with some more guys and would get their revenge. 

Come about 3:00 am, the cock fight was long over and the place was empty. I was just finishing up with one of the whores, a sweet little Latin chick named “Madusa”. She only had one leg, but she can suck the sheets right up your ass! Then came the ruckus. 

Up pulled no less that 5 big, jacked-up pickup trucks, just hauling ass and doing donuts while some of the fellas hung out the windows shooting their guns. Now I cannot tell a lie. The General is a proud son of the South. In fact, my heart yearns for a return to the good old days of an aristocratic South, free from the meddling federal government. Back in them good old days when a bunch of rowdy rednecks came onto your property raising hell you settled things with an axe handle and several shallow graves. Lots of problems were solved in these South Georgia swamps thattaway. 

Well, those good old boys stormed the place looking to settle the score with Boss N#gger. I quickly got dressed and ran into the barn to find that there were 10 men standing there, surrounding Boss N#gger. They were all carrying weapons. One man was carrying a noose. Things looked bad for Boss N#gger. Real bad. 

Maybe it was the sight of this mess, a prelude to a lynching, that stirred my soul to act. Maybe it was all the cocaine I had done earlier that night. I don’t know. But I decided that I was going to intervene. Nobody was going to get lynched here tonight. 

I walked into the barn and yelled, “HEY, F#GGOTS!! NOBODY IS LYNCHING ANYONE HERE TONIGHT!” The crowd turned and looked at me approaching, in stunned silence. The leader of this crew was an old redneck named Silas. He pointed in my direction and said “Hey, now look General, this does not involve you. This here is between me and Boss N#gger.”

I didn’t really know Boss N#gger except as the proprietor of this establishment. The fact is, we had barely said two words to each other. See, Boss N#gger does not like white people. So with me being a honky, he had little use for me. But his place was my kind of scene. I always paid my bill and I didn’t start any shit. So he tolerated me. He had a reputation of being a real badass and I had no urge to cross him. 

I walked right up to Silas and said “I am going to give you 10 seconds to apologize to Boss N#gger for coming in here raising hell, then you are going to turn around and get your f#ggot asses out of here.” 

Silas looked around at his crew to gauge their reactions. Then he started laughing. They all started laughing. I took a couple steps back, but still stood facing Silas. Then I opened my coat so he could see the two pistols I was packing. They suddenly got quiet. I said “I don’t think it’s nice...you laughing.” 

The first of Silas’s crew to make a move was old Cletus. He raised his shotgun. I pulled my pistols. That son of a bitch was dead with a massive head wound before his body hit the floor. I was carrying a couple Glock 17s back then, both with high cap mags in each. As all hell broke loose I opened fire. Half of those good old boys tried to fight. I dropped them all. The last four ran for the door. “BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM!” 

They were all down in just an instant. All head shots except for one. I only tagged Silas in the shoulder. I walked up to Silas lying there. He looked up at me and started begging for his life. I put the heal of my boot on his shoulder wound and grinded at it, twisting my heal back and forth. Silas was screaming from the pain.

Just about then Boss N#gger walked up. I turned to him and said “I saved this bitch for you, Boss N#gger. Do with him as you will.” Boss N#gger put his huge hand on my shoulder and said “Thank ya, General. From now on you and I are tight.” I nodded at him then walked off. As I climbed up into my truck I could hear Silas screaming. I don’t know what Boss N#gger was doing to him exactly, but I know it was righteous! 

Boss N#gger and I have been tight since that day I saved his black ass from those rednecks. We periodically call on one another to catch up on things, and when we need someone we can trust for a particular job. That’s why I called him for this particular bigfoot hunt. 

Come 5:00 am I left my hide and walked out of the wood line. I radioed Boss N#gger that we ought to meet back at my truck. I do not know why, but the idea stuck with me that if we did the exact same thing that Hawg Leg and I did last night, the Sasquatch may show itself again.

You see, this night was identical to the last. Even though we heard and saw no Sasquatch activity, the woods were eerily silent. There were no bugs chirping and no animals stirring. It was quite bizarre. It was a textbook experience for the presence of a Sasquatch. 

Back at the truck I asked Boss N#gger what he thought. He said “Well Sir, there be a haint-like spell on these here woods tonight.” Boss N#gger  felt it too. Then he asked, “You want to go into the house and fuck them 2 bitches in there?” 

Before I could answer we heard it. It was a blood curdling scream from the woods. It sounded like it was just inside the wood line. I told Boss N#gger “There he is! Let’s take cover behind my truck and blast the shit out of him when he steps out!” 

Boss N#gger said “Fuck that shit, General! I ain’t scared of no fuckin monkey.” Then he started strutting toward the woods where the scream came from. He was also talking trash to the monster. He said “Hey, Sasquatch! Git yo bitch ass out here RIGHT NOW! I is gonna put an ass whoopin’ on your hairy ass!” 

I was stunned at Boss N#gger’s directness. Was he deliberately trying to confuse the beast by approaching it? Or, was he just THIS badass? But before I could give it any thought the huge Sasquatch stepped out of the wood line and showed itself. It stared at the approaching Boss N#gger, showing it’s teeth and growling. 

Boss N#gger just kept moving forward. But when that monster started growling at him Boss N#gger got pissed! He yelled at the Sasquatch “NOW I KNOW YOU AIN’T GROWLING AT ME, YOU NASTY ASS BEAST!”

Boss N#gger then CHARGED the beast! That’s right … HE charged the beast! As he ran he pulled out his .50 BMG, held it forward with one hand like it was a pistol, and dumped a mag into it!! I could see the Sasquatch twitch and jerk with each shot that hit home. 

When he ran out of ammo Boss N#gger threw down the gun and seemed to accelerate toward the thing. When he was about 10 yards from the Bigfoot he leapt at it. Boss N#gger’s feet did not hit the ground again until he tackled the monster. They both went tumbling into the wood line. 

Up until now I stood there in stunned silence watching this drama unfold. But when Boss N#gger tackled the beast I took off running toward them. I could hear the struggle in the brush as I ran. As I was right at the wood line, out stepped Boss N#gger! 

That son of a bitch, Boss N#gger, was holding the limp body of that huge 12’ beast over his head! Then, with a guttural scream of vengeance, Boss N#gger ripped the goddamn Sasquatch into TWO PIECES!!

I could not fucking believe what I was seeing. Blood and guts went everywhere. Finally Boss N#gger tossed the pieces of the Bigfoot corpse onto the ground and said “Ain’t no fucking monkey a match fo my black ass!” 

I said “Goddamn, Boss N#gger! That was some righteous shit right there!” He replied, “Damn straight it was.” He was covered in Bigfoot blood and what appeared to be intestines. It smelled like microwaved dog shit. I suggested we go to the house so he could get cleaned up and we could tell the bitches what happened.

As Boss N#gger showered in Rita’s bathroom, I relayed the story to the bitches over coffee. They were enthralled by what I had to say, as well as being filled with relief. 

The sun had started rising and it was getting light outside. By then I was on my third cup of coffee. Boss N#gger came walking in wearing nothing but a towel. The bitches looked him up and down, with goo-goo eyes and big smiles on their faces. 

Boss N#gger then spoke up, “Well, General, are we gonna fuck these bitches or what?” I said I had been up for two days in a row and that I had to get some sleep. He nodded and I got up to leave. I looked back as I was walking out the door and saw Boss N#gger with a bitch in each arm, walking toward Rita’s bedroom. ",1,1732047651.0,Sasquatch_Nazi,0,1.0,False

I had been thinking about adopting a cat to bring to college with me, to help with my anxiety. I had said I would only choose an older cat. But life had other plans.
On October 3rd while at college, I got a call from my mother. She told me that she was currently standing outside of my doctor’s office back home because a kitten was hiding in a sign (similar to the last photo I added). She had watched a car in front of her swerve and barely miss hitting this tiny kitten on main street. She slammed on her breaks, pulled over, and ran after this kitten, leaving the car on and the door open.
After about thirty minutes of trying to coax the kitten out with some beef jerky, my mother gave up and just stuck her hand under the sign and drug him out.
So now, he’s on track to become a dorm cat next fall. I had no plans on raising a kitten again, but I absolutely fell in love with him. The first time I picked him up, he butted his head against my face exactly how my last cat used to do, and I almost cried.

Pictures are in order of when she found him, first and second were on the day of, the next was that Saturday when I came home and helped her bathe him, and the last three are from around a week or so ago.

1gv6rbk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gv6rbk/is_the_friendship_dead/,Is the friendship dead?,"Hi everybody, I’m absolutely new here and I am looking for advice.
Please brace yourselves, because it’s going to be a pretty long post.

So, I (23F) have a best friend (25F) whom I met at a beach bar 6 years ago, and we’ve been like sisters ever since.
Earlier in my life, when I was a teenager trying to be an adult, started making some self destructive choices, especially when it came to dating. After I broke up my 2 year relationship, I was pretty unstable, angry at every man ever known. After my ex boyfriend I dated pretty questionable men, who were toxic 99% of the time. 
That’s when I was a pretty fun friend to be around, I always had the funniest stories and anecdotes. 
 2 years ago I met a man that I immediately fell in love with. Our relationship was moving pretty fast, so I ended up moving away to Germany after 3 months of dating. 
At the start of our relationship, the toxic men whom I’ve dated earlier blew up in my face, because a certain someone decided to fill my boyfriend’s head with some stories about me that were absolutely fake but I figured it’s because I hurt his feelings. I was doing really bad at that time, in a new country, no friends, no job, no money, no close family fighting with my boyfriend. That’s when my friend, let’s call her Natalie, came to visit us for a few days and helped me kinda go through this tough time and I was forever grateful. Fast forward few months later, we were doing great, I got the best job ever in a private hospital, getting paid really well, we moved into a new apartment and everything was perfect. 
That’s when I figured out something is not going well with my best friend. She started hanging around some shady people, telling me stories that didn’t sound like my best friend at all, in fact, it sounded like someone I would never choose to be around, she started talking about how she wants to get pregnant while she was living in a hotel room with her boyfriend, started telling me how she has to give her boyfriend 500 euros for him to buy weed, and then asking me for money a month later. 
One day, she asked me if she can come to visit me at the city I’m in and i immediately said yes, I haven’t seen my girl in a long time and I was looking forward to seeing her.
The day she texted me she is on her way (it’s a 6 hour drive) she also texted me something along the lines of “I hope you have money because I don’t”. I figured it was a joke, laughed it off and went home from work to wait for her. She came, I opened the door and wanted to hug her, she gave me a half ass hug and just sat on my couch and started texting. I asked her if she wanted coffee, and after 15 minuted I felt like she was angry or something so I asked her if everything is okay, she replied yes and we ended up talking about something stupid and after some time my boyfriend came home, got in the apartment all excited, greeted her, asked her how she’s doing and she completely ignored him, and continued to be on her phone. Me and my man, Alex (27) exchanged looks, like what the fuck is going on.  
In those few days, she showed no respect of the place she is staying in, taking 45 min long showers, just bing eating things in our fridge, drinking all our coffee in 2 days, being really ungrateful for anything really. For example, I made pancakes and she opened my kitchen cabinet, opened the Nutella that was half full, gave me a dirty look and in a mocking tone asked me, “is this really all you have?”. I felt really bad at that moment because even though I had a great paying job, I still had an old car that needed fixing, we both had to pitch together and buy new furniture for our apartment because it was completely empty + I had some debts that needed taking care of at my home country. She started demanding really weird things, she wanted me to go to a big city near me and pay for our dinner there, which costs cca 100€ everywhere if it’s not Mc Donalds. She asked me for my card so she can buy herself tampons, cigarettes and whatnot. She was really rude to Alex, really rude to me and it was really a 1000 more situations that I honestly don’t even remember. One day, I was at work when Alex sent me a message asking me if I told her it was okay to go through my closet. I, of course, said no? What are you talking about? When Alex told me she got up in the morning, turned the TV on, didn’t even say hi to him and after some time she decided to go in our bedroom and started rifling through my closet. I was obviously very uncomfortable, because where I come from, people keep A LOT of personal things in their closet. 
The last straw for me was Natalie and I went to my balcony to smoke a cigarette and she asked me for money to go back to our home country. I tried explaining to her that I’m not in a really great situation financially, and of course I will try to give her as much as she needed, but I also asked her why did she invite herself over if she knew she had no money, and why is she asking me for money when 2 weeks ago she was telling me how she’s going to give her boyfriend money to buy weed? 
That’s when she started telling me how she plans to get pregnant, buy a new car from a salon and build a house with the deadbeat boyfriend that she’s with and I felt like i was talking to someone who was on drugs. My girl didn’t even have 50 euros on her and she was telling me all these things that she is going to do when she goes back.
Many things happened in the middle from there to today but:
Fast forward to today, I called her to see how she’s doing (keep in mind in the last 2 years she didn’t call me once, it’s always me calling her) and we started talking, and I shared with her my plans to go to school next year so I can move forward and get a promotion at the hospital I’m working with.
That’s when she started being passive agressive with me, telling me things like “Why would you go to school?”, “Did you even graduate?”, “Wow, okay.” all in such a derogatory tone, like she was trying to make me feel bad. That’s when I excused myself from the conversation, hung up and started crying. I felt like I was supportive to her through everything and wanted for her to get in a better place, and i felt like the moment things started looking better for me, it was making her angry instead of making her happy.
I called Alex and told him I don’t plan on calling her anymore and that i think ill just let the friendship die, because I am always the one to call, and if I don’t she wont either.

### Training
This was the second marathon that I have run. My first marathon was the 2018 Marine Corps Marathon. I battled shin pain the entire training block and a majority of weeks only consisted of a long run and maybe a short run. I ended up running around 4:40 with a huge wall at mile 21. I was loosely running half marathons without much training between then and now. This training block I decided to sign up with the training team associated with the Richmond Marathon since I am local. It is a 24 week program. Each week consisted of a weekend group long run, a midweek run half the distance of the long run, a short recovery run and a workout that was either hills or track. I averaged about 22 miles per week and peaked at 33 miles. I made sure I did the long run and mid week run every week and then most weeks did hills or a tempo 4-6 mile. This training block my goal was to focus on consistency and staying healthy with a lot of stretching, icing and light physical therapy. I was not working toward any specific goal. I was feeling posterior shin soreness on both legs throughout the entire time pretty much, but it almost never bothered me during my runs. I really worked on my nutrition plan throughout training and only ""bonked"" on one long run which is probably from having a 23 hour travel day coming back from vacation. 

### Pre-race
The Saturday before the race I was feeling good and ready until I rolled my ankle on what ended up being my last run before the marathon. On Monday, I tried to do a super slow run/walk on a treadmill to test out my leg. I could not run without a limp. Pain continued to get worse each day. On Tuesday I caught a stomach bug. It felt like everything was going wrong. Suddenly though on Friday, all of the leg pain went away. I trained with a small group of people for almost every run throughout the last 24 weeks. After training I felt like I could go sub 4 hours, but decided to run with them to their goal of 4:10. I was still going for a PR at that pace and was able to enjoy the race with the people that I spent hours with every week training. Leading up I carb loaded and upped my hydration even more starting Thursday. Sunday morning I woke up at 4:00am ate my breakfast, drank my coffee, used the bathroom 3 times and made it to the start at 6:30am. Unfortunately I couldn't find the group I was going to run with when the race started at 7:00am and was on my own.

### Race
The plan was to take it about 30 seconds slower than 4:10 pace for the first two miles, settle in for miles 3-7 and then decide to beat 4:10 or stay on track. This went out the window when I couldn't find my group and did not know if they were in front or behind. Luckily I saw a friend spectating and he let me know my group was just ahead at mile 3, so I sped up a bit and caught them. We set into a consistent pace and everyone was feeling good. We hit mile 7 which was a long downhill and were able to easily bank some time. Everything was going well, but we decided to just stay consistent and keep our pace. We hit the first bigger hill around mile 10 and one of our group dropped back from us and she told us to keep going. This is where I felt the start of an arch blister. We continued on still hitting out paces and reach the half at 2:03. Again everyone was feeling good and we were going to stay consistent and still go for 4:10. At Mile 15 you reach a pretty exposed highway bridge for about a mile. The other two I was with started struggling a little, but I was going to stay with them. That is until Mile 18 when they told me they needed to start walking. I was told to leave them and continue since I was still feeling really good. I was able to see my wife and kids right after this point and give them all hugs and kisses which really helped kick it into gear. I immediately hit an 8 minute pace which I pulled a little back to 8:30. At this point sub 4 hour still was not a thought. I was just running by feel. I continued at this pace until mile 20 and looked at my time and realized sub 4 might happen. From here on out it was just a mental battle. Nutrition wise I felt fine. I took an SIS every 3 miles and alternated between the regular and the Beta version for about 70g carbs per hour. Every mile alternated between I can make sub 4 and I can't. I just continued pushing through and at mile 25 I knew I could do it. After starting to slow down from miles 23-25 to almost 9 minutes per mile, I ran the last mile at 7:30 pace and the last quarter mile at under 6:30 (god bless that downhill finish) to cross at 3:59:26 chip time.  

### Post-race
I honestly couldn't believe I was able to go under 4 hours after pacing for about 4:10 until Mile 18. The last 400m, 1 mile, 5K, 10K, 20K, half, 30K were all the fastest splits of this race and of that which I logged in my Garmin through this training block. Even without hitting under 4 hours, I felt I met all of my goals heading into this race. I trained consistently without injury taking time off, I had a race plan and executed it for even or negative splits, PRed, I was under 4:10 and then I hit my late race goal of sub 4 hours (which was not even a goal that morning). It was a great race with great support by family, friends, and all spectators, nutrition went great and training was great. Next year I definitely plan on increasing mileage, days and adding speedwork and strength. My Garmin predicts I can run 3:19 which sounds crazy, but I feel like I could still get another big PR with more speed and strength focus.

This is likely a false statement by Matthew. It's more likely that Matthew cannot obtain the video because he has a court order barring him from contacting the court staff relating to this case outside of filing a proper motion via e-filing. If he signs up for e-filing, then he can no longer claim he isn't served (he is).
