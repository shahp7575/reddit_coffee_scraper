( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

1nvtwoi,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1nvtwoi/how_to_unblock_craigslist/,How To Unblock Craigslist,"Getting blocked from Craigslist can feel like hitting a brick wall, especially when you depend on the platform for business or important transactions. With 142 million visits in January 2025 and over 60 billion monthly page views, Craigslist remains one of the internet's most popular classified ad platforms. However, thousands of users face IP blocks every day, often without clear warning or explanation.

Whether you're a small business owner posting legitimate ads, a job seeker responding to listings, or someone who simply got caught in Craigslist's automated detection system, being blocked can mean lost opportunities and revenue. The good news? You can regain access safely while protecting yourself from the security threats that plague the platform. This guide will show you exactly how to unblock Craigslist using proven methods, with security and privacy as top priorities.

# Understanding Craigslist Blocks: Why They Happen

Before diving into solutions, it's crucial to understand why Craigslist implements these restrictions. Craigslist's algorithms constantly scan for suspicious behavior across millions of posts and accounts to protect users from scammers and spammers who try to exploit the platform daily.

# Three Types of Craigslist Blocks

Craigslist uses three main types of blocks: ghosting, IP address bans, and account bans:

**IP Ban (Complete Lockout)**: You cannot access Craigslist at all from your current IP address. Every page returns an error, regardless of which section you're trying to access.

**Account Block**: You can still visit Craigslist, but you cannot post ads, respond to listings, or perform any interactive functions with your account.

**Ghosting (Shadow Ban)**: Your ads appear to post successfully, but they never show up in search results or category listings. You're the only one who can see them, essentially making your presence invisible to other users.

# Common Reasons for Getting Blocked

Understanding what triggers these blocks can help you avoid them in the future:

* **Posting Too Frequently**: According to Craigslist's terms and conditions, you shouldn't post in more than one city and one category within 48 hours. Violating this rule is one of the fastest ways to get blocked.
* **Posting in Multiple Locations**: If you post a personal ad in Chicago and Los Angeles at the same time, you might get flagged by Craigslist, as the platform uses your IP address to determine your location.
* **Using Public WiFi**: When using public Wi-Fi, you'll be sharing the same IP address with multiple users on the network, resulting in an IP or account ban if anyone on that network violates Craigslist's policies.
* **Data Scraping**: The platform has powerful anti-bot software that quickly detects web scrapers or bots attempting to collect pricing information or other data.
* **Posting Prohibited Items**: This includes weapons, prescription drugs, alcohol, recalled items, and other content that violates platform rules.

# Security Threats You Need To Know About

Getting unblocked is only part of the equation. Craigslist lacks some safety features that newer platforms have, such as built-in payment systems, better user verification, and purchase protections. This makes it a prime target for cybercriminals.

**Common security threats on Craigslist include:**

* **Phishing Attacks**: Scammers send emails appearing to be from Craigslist or other users, containing malicious links that steal credentials or install malware on your device.
* **Malware Distribution**: Bad actors manipulate email HTML to create buttons linked to OneDrive or other cloud storage containing macro-enabled spreadsheets that download malware when opened.
* **Payment Scams**: Wire transfer frauds, overpayment schemes, and fake escrow services designed to steal your money.
* **Personal Information Theft**: Requests for Social Security numbers, bank account details, or other sensitive data used for identity theft.

This is why using a security-focused solution to unblock Craigslist isn't just about regaining access—it's about protecting yourself from these very real threats.

# How To Unblock Craigslist Safely With a VPN

After testing different workarounds, using a high-quality VPN is the easiest and most reliable way to get back on Craigslist. A Virtual Private Network (VPN) does two critical things: it changes your IP address and encrypts your internet traffic, making it an ideal solution for both unblocking and security.

# Why VPNs Are the Best Solution

When you connect to a VPN, it routes your internet traffic through a secure server in a location of your choice, assigning you that server's IP address. This immediately circumvents IP-based blocks. More importantly, **VPNs encrypt your entire connection**, which means:

* Your ISP cannot see what websites you're visiting
* Hackers on public WiFi cannot intercept your data
* Craigslist scammers cannot easily track your real location
* Malicious ads and tracking scripts are blocked (with built-in protection features)

# Why Premium VPNs Matter

VPNs are unreliable on Craigslist because every VPN has only a few IP addresses at any time, which are constantly in use by thousands of people—but this applies primarily to free or cheap VPN services. Premium VPNs regularly rotate their IP addresses and maintain large server networks, making them much more effective.

# NordVPN: The Top Choice for Craigslist Access

Based on extensive testing and user reports, **NordVPN stands out as the most reliable option for unblocking Craigslist** in 2025. Here's why:

**Massive Server Network**: With servers in 15 U.S. cities and 5700+ servers globally, you can always switch your IP address if you get banned. This extensive coverage ensures you'll always have a working IP address available.

**Built-In Threat Protection**: NordVPN includes Threat Protection that blocks malicious websites, intrusive ads, and malware before they reach your device—critical protection when dealing with Craigslist's scam-heavy environment.

**Obfuscated Servers**: NordVPN includes obfuscated servers that make it difficult for platforms to detect that you're using a VPN to bypass IP bans. This is especially important since Craigslist has become more sophisticated at detecting VPN traffic.

**Military-Grade Encryption**: Your Craigslist activity remains completely private with AES-256 encryption, preventing ISPs, network administrators, and cybercriminals from monitoring your browsing.

**Kill Switch Protection**: Always turn on the NordVPN kill switch before connecting to a server, as it protects your info when your NordVPN connection drops, preventing accidental IP leaks.

# Step-by-Step: Unblock Craigslist With a VPN

**Step 1**: Subscribe to a premium VPN service like NordVPN and download the app for your device (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, etc.).

**Step 2**: Install the VPN application and log in with your credentials.

**Step 3**: Enable the kill switch in the VPN settings to prevent IP leaks if your connection drops.

**Step 4**: Connect to a server in the Craigslist region you want to access. Choosing a server nearby gives you the fastest speeds, with 95.31% of visits in January 2025 coming from the US.

**Step 5**: Open your browser in incognito/private mode to prevent old cookies from interfering.

**Step 6**: Access Craigslist and verify you can browse and post without issues.

**Pro Tip**: If it doesn't work at first, try clearing your cookies, switching browsers, or using incognito mode to prevent any old session data from causing issues.

# Alternative Methods To Unblock Craigslist

While VPNs are the most reliable and secure solution, here are some alternative methods:

# Mobile Data Switching

If you're on a network that uses firewalls to block Craigslist, the easiest workaround is to switch from Wi-Fi to mobile data. This gives you a different IP from your cellular provider. However, this is only a temporary solution and may consume significant mobile data.

# Tor Browser

The free, open-source Tor browser provides anonymous browsing by hiding your IP address and location. While effective at masking your identity, Tor has significant drawbacks: it's much slower than VPNs, you cannot choose your location, and your IP address is visible at Tor's entry and exit node, meaning Craigslist might still recognize your IP as blocked.

# Router Reset

Restarting your router might assign you a new IP address if your ISP uses dynamic IP allocation. However, this doesn't work if you have a static IP, and it's not a reliable long-term solution.

**Why these alternatives fall short**: None of these methods provide the comprehensive security and reliability of a premium VPN. They don't encrypt your traffic, protect you from malware, or offer the flexibility to quickly switch between multiple IP addresses.

# Best Practices To Avoid Future Blocks

Once you've regained access to Craigslist, follow these guidelines to prevent getting blocked again:

**Follow the 48-Hour Rule**: According to the platform's terms and conditions, you shouldn't post in more than one city and one category within 48 hours. Set reminders if you post frequently.

**Avoid Public WiFi Without Protection**: Always use a VPN when accessing Craigslist from coffee shops, libraries, or other public networks to prevent being caught up in other users' violations.

**Don't Post in Multiple Locations**: Stick to your actual geographic location to avoid triggering location-based flags.

**Clear Your Browser Cookies Regularly**: Cookies and cached data can store identifying information that Craigslist uses to connect your current session with previous banned activity.

**Use Legitimate, Accurate Content**: Avoid keyword stuffing, misleading information, or anything that could be flagged as spam.

# Essential Security Tips for Safe Craigslist Use

Protecting yourself from Craigslist scams is just as important as avoiding blocks:

* **Meet in Public Places**: Choose a safe public place for your meeting spot. Shopping centers and popular coffee shops are great, but parking lots next to local police stations are even better.
* **Never Wire Money in Advance**: One common scam is for the seller to ask for wire transfers in advance. Never wire funds before inspecting the product.
* **Examine Items Thoroughly**: Be thorough, check if it's intact and if it works. Unpack the item if it's packed. There have been cases of people purchasing a smartphone in a sealed box and finding a random rectangular object after unboxing it at home.
* **Use Secure Payment Methods**: Stick to cash for in-person transactions or digital wallets with buyer protection like PayPal Goods & Services.
* **Enable VPN Threat Protection**: If your VPN includes malware blocking (like NordVPN's Threat Protection), keep it enabled to automatically block malicious websites and phishing attempts.
* **Trust Your Instincts**: If the deal seems too good to be true, it probably is. Walk away from suspicious offers.

# Conclusion: Stay Safe and Unblocked

Getting blocked from Craigslist doesn't have to mean the end of your buying, selling, or job-hunting activities on the platform. By using a premium VPN service like NordVPN, you can not only regain access immediately but also protect yourself from the numerous security threats that target Craigslist users daily.

**Remember these key takeaways:**

* Premium VPNs with large server networks and regular IP rotation are essential for reliable Craigslist access
* Security features like encryption, kill switches, and malware blocking protect you beyond just unblocking
* Following Craigslist's posting rules and best practices prevents future blocks
* Meeting in public, avoiding wire transfers, and examining items thoroughly keeps you safe from scams

Don't let an IP ban stop you from using one of the internet's most valuable classified ad platforms. Take action today to secure your Craigslist access while protecting your privacy and security online. With the right tools and knowledge, you can use Craigslist safely and effectively for years to come.

**Disclaimer**: This guide is intended to help users who have been unfairly blocked from Craigslist regain legitimate access while maintaining their security and privacy. Always follow Craigslist's Terms of Service and use VPN technology responsibly.

**RECAP**

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/ulfYukcg5u): **August 12, 2025**

Hiya there, I’m in a bit of a pickle and don’t really know what to do here.

A few days ago, my (30f) ex’s (32m) new girlfriend (27f) texted me out of the blue and told me – first politely and then not so much – to back the fuck off and not contact my ex anymore cos, apparently, it’s disrespectful and I ‘should be over it by now’.

Some context here: My ex and I broke up roughly six years ago but we are still friends. Why? Cos we didn’t have a reason not to.

Our break up wasn’t a dramatic one – just two people who’d been together since their late teens realising that they wanted different things in life.

But since we still got along great and he had his daughter – my “niece” – who I basically helped raise we decided to stay friends.

The reason his girlfriends message surprised me as much as it did is that a) it came really out of the blue. I didn’t even know she had my number b) she has absolutely zero reason to be suspicious or anything.

My ex and I still hang out, yes, but always with either my niece or other friends. And, on occasion, we go to school events for my niece – like, when she has a performance or something.

I genuinely don’t think I’ve done anything with him one on one since…damn, since before our break up I think? The most ‘one on one’ he and I ever do is when he drops off or picks up my niece – she has a room at my place, in case that matters - and we wait for her to get her things. But that’s all.

Also: His girlfriend and I have met before at my nieces and then my ex’s birthday and she was nice both times. We didn’t talk much, just regular ‘hi, how are you, nice to meet you, that’s a lovely dress, bye’, so I didn’t think she had any issues with me.

On top of that: I’m dating someone new, too.

So yeah, I’m not sure what her deal is at all. And when she texted me, my arse was halfway to giving my ex a ring and telling him to maybe have a chat with his girlfriend cos something is definitely wrong but another part of me really doesn’t want to interfere with his relationship like that.

My ex is a good dude and, from what my niece told me and from what I’ve seen at the two birthdays, he really adores her. Like, he genuinely gets puppy eyes when he looks at her which that stoic arse man NEVER does. He deserves to be this happy, he really does.

And, most importantly, my niece likes her too. That wasn't the case with the two other girlfriends he'd had since we broke up, so this is a huge issue I need to consider, too.

Telling him would put all of this in jeopardy but like…what else am I supposed to do?

I’m defo not going to cut contact with either my niece or my ex just cos she wants me to, no fucking way, but she was rather insistent on the matter, so I don’t think she’ll leave it alone either.

My flatmate is team ‘tell him and get it over with’, but she’s, with love, a bit of a prick so I’m hesitant to take her word on anything.

**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP was leaning toward NTA**

**Relevant Comments** 

**Commenter 1:** He deserves to know if his girlfriend is talking to his friends like that or making accusations of flirting with him. Tell him. 

> **OOP:** That is the wildest part - she didn't even accuse me of flirting with him. Like, if she had been able to genuinely tell me what upset her then I could've cleared the air but she really just wants me gone cos she thinks exes have no business being friends.
> 
> But yeah, I think I'll have to give him a call tonight - even if he does nothing, at least he knows.

**Commenter 2:** Send him the screenshots. But tell him he can step back from being a friend but not to take your niece away from you. This kind of stupid childish drama is not good for a kid.

> **OOP:** Oh defo. Not that I think he would drag my niece into this, he's not the type. Also: I'm pretty much the closest thing to a maternal figure she has and have been ever since she was like...two? I think? So yeah, doubt he'd take that from her. And he knows I'd fist fight him if he dared to try, lol, but I'll defo make sure to mention it!

**Commenter 3:** One of my non negotiables is somebody whose ex still comes around the family, but I make sure to make that known at the beginning of the relationship. She shouldn't have came at you the way she did but sometimes when it comes to an ex, you don't realize how disrespectful some of the things you two are doing can be seen by the new partners.

> **OOP:** I guess that's fine, but in that case it's really silly that she's only coughing that up now. I think they've been together for a year / a year and a half.
> 
> AND she's dating someone with a kid, too, isn't an ex to be expected in that scenario? Granted, our case is a little special cos my niece's mother bailed and I'm there instead but still.
> 
> Aside from that: I can see that disrespectful thing in general but really not with my ex and I. Genuinely, the most we do is hug hello and goodbye and that's normal in my country - as in, I hugged his girlfriend too . Aside from that... I guess I usually pop by on christmas for an hour or two cos of my niece. But outside of that there's nothing that I wouldn't do with any other friend too. 
> 
> I do think she knows that, however, cos when I asked her to give me examples or a situation where I could've made her uncomfortable she couldn’t say anything. Just that I bothered her.

I thought I'd give you guys a little update in case any of you are interested.

First: I did end up calling my ex after I came back from work last night. I was insanely nervous cos I still felt (and still do feel) bad about rocking the boat but yeah, you guys were right. It should be his decision if he wants to cut me off, not his GF's.

Now, after some regular chatter I went in and told him what happened and even read him some of the messages his girlfriend had sent me.

He didn't say much as I did (not that I expected him to, that man has a daily average of 15 words. 25 if he's feeling very chatty.) and mostly just listened quietly. I couldn't gauge his reaction, so I kind of ended up rambling and mentioning some of the things you guys had advised me to - you know how he can step back if that's what he needs, I'd respect his decision on that, but how I'd appreciate it if we could keep my niece out of it and all that.

The latter part is kind of where he spoke up - mostly to snort 'you idiot' - and then he told me he already knew that she'd texted me cos my boyfriend told him (they're friends and co-workers).
My boyfriend apparently noticed that I was more upset than I wanted to let on and asked my ex to call me 'cos something happened between her \[me\] and your \[my ex's\] girlfriend'.

(Which makes sense, btw. I’ve asked my boyfriend if my behaviour with my ex was ever uncomfortable or inappropriate after the GF texted me, just to make sure I wasn’t doing something wrong without being aware of it AND I have been stewing over this mess for like, nigh a week, so yeah. Not surprised my boyfriend noticed something was up.)

My ex chose to wait until I said something myself before breaching the topic, though. My boyfriend didn't tell him what exactly happened but my ex sort of figured it was something like her telling me to cut contact.

He then, once again, told me that I'm an idiot and that I should've told him immediately, cos this wasn't on. The two of them (so he and his GF) talked about this before - even before they officially got together - and he'd made it very clear that there was no way in hell he'd be cutting me off cos 'I've been his friend before I was his girlfriend and I've stayed his friend for long after that' and cos I’m basically my nieces mum or the closest thing she has to a mum.

So, before they started dating, he told her that she’d have to be cool with that. He’d understand if she wasn’t but he’d not change his mind cos I’ve done the legwork and she hasn’t.

Now, according to him she was absolutely fine with it and even told him that she really liked me and wanted to get to know me more after the birthdays I mentioned prior, so he doesn’t know what has gotten into her.

I asked him if she mentioned something else at a latter time – like, that something I did or said made her uncomfortable or feel insecure – but he said no. She also didn't hint at anything.

And yes, I asked multiple times WITH examples just to make sure, cos, respectfully, my ex isn't great at taking hints. At all. His brain is wired stricktly forwards so anything sligthly obscure does NOT ring any bells in his wee head.

As we chattered on, still trying to work out what could’ve ticked her off, he suddenly got REALLY quiet and I was like ‘dude, you there?’ and he then said that he may have an idea what did it for her. He didn’t tell me what though cos he said it’s a conversation he needs to have with her first, so I didn’t ask further. He did assure me that it was nothing I did, though.

We pretty much left it at that and he told me he’d have a chat with her and see what’s up and, depending on what it is, he’d let me know. So now we wait.

Oh and we both kind of hope that she left it at contacting me and didn’t talk to my niece about this. She’s kind of been in a funk all week but keeps telling us it’s nothing so we kind of assumed it was hormones and/or stress and told her to take it easy. But since the dates of her bad mood and the GF messaging me line up, we’re a bit worried that the she mentioned something or asked my niece to cut me off or whatever.

Anyway, thanks for the advice you guys gave me and for telling me to just get it over with. I genuinely don’t think I would’ve done it otherwise. If I hear anything interesting, I’ll let you guys know but until then I think this is it.

Thanks!

EDIT/MORE INFO: I think a lot of people are confused by my niece being my niece and also my ex's kid. Sorry, I should've reiterated that before things got muddled.

A short stack of facts:

My ex (32m) is a teen dad. He had my niece while he was still in (the equivalent of) high school. He and I (30f) got together roughly a year after she was born, but he only introduced me to her when she was two and a half.

Since I was still pretty young then, I wasn't super comfortable with being called 'mum', so my ""niece"" ended up calling me auntie \[my name\]. This stuck and she still calls me aunt today and I call her niece, but we're not related by blood.

Her bio mum is not and has never been in the picture. I did all the mum things - from potty training her to seeing most of her firsts to going to her parent teacher conferences and what not. This is why my ex says I'm the closest thing she has to a mother.

And, to finish it up: My ex and I didn't break up recently. We broke up six years ago cos we wanted different things in life. We stayed in contact cos we've always been friends first and, most importantly, cos of my niece.

These days, my niece comes to stay with me at least every other week (sometimes more, sometimes less cos my ex and I are both chill with her choosing for herself) and she has her own room at my place.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Sounds like your ex has a solid understanding of your role in his and your niece’s life, which is great. His GF’s behavior is still a bit odd though, especially since she apparently liked you before. Glad you were able to clear the air.

> **OOP:** Yeah, it really makes this whole thing even stranger. I really hope he lets me know what it ended up being, just for my own peace of mind (and, admittedly, cos I'm a wee bit curious). If she actually ends up telling him, that is!

**Commenter 2:** Your nerves were totally understandable, but it’s good you took control of the situation. Now at least everyone’s cards are on the table and your ex knows exactly where you stand.

> **OOP:** yeah, ngl, I'm a huge wuss where things like these are concearned. I'm fine arguing and fighting myself if no one else is involved. I do, however, genuinely hate being a bother to anyone and rocking the boat by tattling on her but yeah, at least now it's kind of off my chest and out of my hands. My ex can probably try to work it out better than I can.

**Commenter 3:** Anyway you can peek at your niece’s phone? I’m Not normally an advocate for this but if your niece is young, what the gf said could be causing harm. I think you NEED to find out.

> **OOP:** Generally, yes I could. And I wouldn't even need to peak, she's fine with us checking her phone after we explained that both my ex and I had out fair share of cyber bullies back in the day - the struggles of being/dating a teen dad in the late 00s - and that we're maybe a bit paranoid of that happening to her, so she's fine with that.
> 
> BUT she's with my ex right now, so I don't have access to her phone. I'll ask him to check and if, for some reason, he can't, I'll have a check myself once she comes over tomorrow. Good thinking!

**Commenter 4:** My fear is the girlfriend tried to make the niece decide between her and you. And did not get the answer she wanted.

> **OOP:** Oh damn, pardon my french, but she'd be so fucking dumb if she actually did that. She's been with my ex (and thus in my nieces life) for like...a year or so now. That's really not a lot of time in general, but definitely not compared to me. It'd be crazy if she actually expected any decent results from that.

**Commenter 5:** Could she be pregnant? If she was, maybe it triggered a reaction in her where she wants one happy family and have your niece as her daughter?

> **OOP:** Oh holy shit. I did not think of that. She probably could be - I'm not exactly asking my ex about his sex life - but I'd assume that yeah, she could. But that'd be a whole arse mess cos, from what I know, my ex doesn't want more kids.

#----NEW UPDATE----

[Final Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/TOwzAqkDHG): **September 25, 2025 (1.5 months later)**

Hullo everybody!

I would start off by saying something like ‘I don’t know if anyone remembers me’ but you’ve all been very vocal in my inbox this past month so I’m just going to assume that yes, some of you do.

This all got much more attention than I ever expected, so I’m honestly quite nervous to even update this cos I just know the result really isn’t what most of you wanted or were hoping for. But my boyfriend and my flatmate were having a field day with all your comments and messages - they asked me to say thanks to the person that ‘came up with the bio mum amnesia car accident theory’? I don’t know either, I stopped reading comments eventually, but they really enjoyed that one – so the two of them were basically bullying me into this.

I’m not really sure where to start so I’ll just go by what I was asked the most, I guess.

Oh and, before that I kind of feel the need to clarify…I don’t call my ex my ex irl. I call him by his name. Right? I got multiple messages asking me to stop calling him that ‘since we’re more than that at this point’ so, just to make that clear. I call him by his first name.

Okay now, first things first: We’re all fine! My niece is fine, my ex and his GF are kind of fine and I’m grand as well. Thanks for checking in and even sending us those…reddit care thingies? You know what I mean.

Then a lot of you were asking about my niece and if we ever found out what was bothering her and yes, we did.

My ex dropped off my niece at my place not long after I posted the second update (it was her turn to stay at my place) and she was still in a shitty mood just like she’d been this entire time, if not a bit worse.

So she didn’t even stay to say bye to my ex, she just stomped off into her room and holed herself up for the day. My ex asked me if I could try and have a chat with her while she stayed over cos apparently he’d tried and it didn’t go over well. I think we were both kind of on edge cos this isn’t usually her style but then again…teens will teen.

Anyway, I told him I’d try and send him on his merry way for now. It took me a couple of days to actually get to the chatting. The first few days were really…woof. It’s like I was sharing my house with a particularly pissed off velociraptor. I basically spent the entire time throwing snacks and wee little trinkets at her, hoping she’ll not bite my hand off in the process.

But eventually she cooled off enough and with some fine needling and enough ice cream to feed an army I managed to get some answers.

Good News: The GF did not talk to her. So, lower thy pitchforks, reddit, the woman is ney a witch.

Bad News: My niece did overhear the GF bad mouthing me on the phone, like some of you guessed.

The GF apparently didn’t know that my niece was home – she came home early from school and the GF didn’t hear her come in – so I doubt it was on purpose but it still happened and my niece did not take it well.

She’d been in a bad mood anyway (just normal teen-struggles, mind. Including – gods help me – boy troubles. Does anyone have a handbook on how to handle THAT!? Cos I’m not ready and since my ex took the news like a man going to war, I seriously doubt he's either.) and hearing the GF talk shit certainly didn’t help.

She really didn’t want to tell me what exactly the GF said, but it seemed to have been really below the belt. Just going the fact that my niece was angry-crying during that part of our chat.

I didn’t pressure to tell me more since it just seemed to upset her, but I did ask her to please tell her dad what was said so that she could get it off of her chest, which she did do after both my ex and I promised that he wouldn’t tell me either.

I know that’s kind of a let down for some of you, but to be honest: I don’t really care. If she wants to talk shit, she can. I’m just happy my niece doesn’t have to carry that stuff around on her own anymore.

Now, as for my ex and his GF…difficult.

It took a while longer for that to get resolved. I actually didn’t hear anything back until quite recently and the end result is kind of…meh?

The short of it is: I was catching strays. That’s all.

My ex eventually called me and told me that much. He also said that his GF would like to talk to me personally and asked me to hear her out. Which fine, sure, I’ll do that.

So, they rocked up to my place about a week ago and we all had tea.

Let me tell you: It was awks. The GF was really twitchy and nervous the entire time and I think we spent twenty minutes just talking about the weather before she finally managed to cough up an apology. That apology was then followed by fifty more, no matter how often I told her that it was okay and that I was more than content to just move on.

She was thankful, but she asked me if I’d let her explain herself, so I did.

And yeah, turns out she…well, she didn’t really have a reason to come at me, but she did have a reason overall for why she acted the way she did.

The first and probably biggest reason I won’t tell you, cos it goes far beyond me telling you about something I was involved in or me sitting here like ‘well she was being a bit of a c\*nt, what do I do?’. But let it be said: Something sad happened. It wasn’t anyone’s fault. Nobody did anything wrong. It was just something tragic that happens to some people and couldn’t be avoided. That’s all.

The second reason was that she apparently had a minor dispute with my ex about…kind of me, I guess? So, from what the two of them told me, the GF texted my ex not long before she first messaged me and asked him if he could pick her up from work cos she wasn’t feeling well. He told her that yes, he would, but it’d take him a while since he was about to drop my niece off at my place.

Now, what he meant by that was: The drive will take longer than usual cos [my name] lives at the other end of town.

What she took it as was: [My name] is more important than you right now, so you’ll have to wait.

(Honestly, I do not get it either. I wasn’t even the reason he was coming over, so I’m not sure why that is how she took it. But okay, fine, she was in a state cos of the sad thing, maybe that’s just how it felt at the time.)

And the third reason is that she feels kind off like the odd one out in my ex’s (and thus partially my) friend group, which was making her feel insecure. And that’d be fine, it’s human, but her reason for feeling like the odd one out was apparently that she’s straight and most of us are not. That surprised both my ex and I cos…yeah nah, most of our friends are, in fact, straight.

In our collective friend group, there’s just me, my boyfriend, my ex (we’re all bi) and one gay chap + his boyfriend. The rest are straight as hell. Like ‘I majored in business, have a wife, a dog and 1 ½ children’ type straight lol. So yeah, we didn’t know how she got that idea and she was honestly very rattled once we’d cleared that up.

All of that then collided into one big ball of frustration and that frustration was then aimed at the easiest target – me. So, she snuck into my ex’s phone, got my number, and told me to back off.

According to her, she immediately regretted it but didn’t know how to fix it until my ex put her on the spot. She also reiterated that she really isn’t bothered by me and that she was being truthful when she’d told my ex that she’d like to get to know me more.

I told her that that was fine by me – yes, this is me cutting her some slack. She overreacted and made a mistake. Shit happens. – but that she might want to try and talk to my niece before that relationship completely evaporated. But once she’s settled that, I’m down to meeting for coffee or hanging out as a group with my niece or whatever.

And that is really kind of where we left it.

I DID ask my ex where his head’s at while the GF was off to the loo and how he’s feeling and he told me he’s not quite sure yet. He does see where she’s coming from and he’s happy that she owned up to her mistakes and wanted to apologise and all that, but he’s miffed that she even reacted like that in the first place. You know, that she'd rather sneak into his phone and then b\*tch at me instead of just talking to him.

Oh and he’s extremely pissed off about the things she said about me (when my niece overheard her, that is).

I didn’t ask him more than that cos we’d promised my niece but I did tell him to not let that be his deciding factor, if anything. Apart from that, I didn’t pry for more.

And that is pretty much it, guys!

Sorry that I can’t deliver the dramatic story filled with big reveals, harsh realisations, and angry break ups but alas, real life tends to be a bit boring and shit just ends with people having a wee chat over tea.

My boyfriend offered to act out a dramatic scene where I break up with him cos I ‘realised I’m still in love with my ex’ in case anyone is interested, lol, but unless that’s it, this is where we part ways.

Thanks for sticking around and for all the advice you’ve given me! I really didn’t expect my little issue would get this much attention, so here’s to me never underestimating reddit again.

Have a lovely day/night wherever you are!

**Relevant / Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** I always love a side character that wants to bring the high drama. Tell your boyfriend he's got a reddit fan.

> **OOP:** Oh no, you're so going to inflate his ego. 😂 (He says thanks, though, he's already got a full script planned.)

**Commenter 2:** This is was a great read! You handled it with grace and maturity, good on you.

You sound like a decent sort of person who I'd be chuffed to have a cup of tea with.

> **OOP:** Aw thanks! I try, haha, but honestly I'm just too tired for drawn out drama, I think.

**Commenter 3:** So gf had a miscarriage, asked boyfriend for a ride in aftermath while he was on the way to dropping daughter off and had an irrational hormone/grief induced reaction and sent a couple of stupid texts. Doesn’t excuse whatever vile rant she had about OP that niece heard that has probably torpedoed that relationship (niece/girlfriend). It’s really hard to come back from hearing something said about your auntie/mom that is so bad you don’t want her to ever know what was said.

**Commenter 4:** Sounds like girlfriend has been feeling insecure for a while and was looking for a convenient scapegoat. Hoping your ex realises that niece has lost all respect for his girlfriend and may actually re-enact Jurassic Park if he tries to pretend everything is ‘fine’ going forward… for real though, once the kid of someone you’re dating has lost all respect for you, the relationship is basically toast. Everything will now be ex trying to choose between his girlfriend (an insecure adult pickme) and his fierce teen daughter who clearly doesn’t tolerate anyone talking shit about people she cares for.  

Please update if teen velociraptor makes a reappearance. Kids can be brutally hilarious.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

It was always overflowing, a miniature Mount Everest of avocado skins and coffee grounds, threatening to spill over onto our already-questionable kitchen counter. My roommate Liam, bless his creative heart, was usually the main culprit. He'd make these epic smoothie bowls and then just... walk away from the evidence.

""Honestly, how hard is it to take out the compost?"" I’d muttered to myself more times than I could count, staring at the growing pile. Maya, our resident queen of organization, had already resorted to passive-aggressive Post-it notes. The latest one, stuck right on the bin, read: ""Future archaeologists will study this heap. Please don't let it be ours."" Liam just laughed it off, saying, ""Lowkey, it *is* a pretty impressive ecosystem."" Meanwhile, Chloe, our social butterfly, would leave her latte mugs on the counter for days, adding to the general kitchen chaos. I felt like I was constantly tiptoeing around a minefield of forgotten tasks.

One Tuesday, I came home after a particularly brutal day at work to find the compost literally spilling onto the floor, a single, rogue banana peel making a break for it. That was it. I was ready to highkey lose it. Instead of yelling, which was my initial gut reaction, I took a deep breath. ""Okay, we need to talk,"" I announced in our group chat, trying to keep my tone neutral. 

That night, we actually sat down. I laid out my frustration, admitting that the mess was stressing me out. Liam, surprisingly, was super understanding. He said, ""Ngl, I just genuinely forget. My brain is usually, like, five steps ahead with a new design concept, and the compost just doesn't register."" Chloe chimed in, ""Yeah, I'm guilty too. I just always think someone else will get it."" Maya, ever the pragmatist, proposed a solution: ""What if we use that shared chore app I found? We can rotate the compost duty and track dishes."" It felt a little formal, but honestly, it was so valid. We all agreed to try it.

It wasn't an overnight miracle, but it made a massive difference. The app notifications actually helped Liam remember, and Chloe started washing her mugs before they fossilized. We even had a ""kitchen clean-up playlist"" that Maya curated. We ended up laughing more than arguing, and eventually, the kitchen became a place where we actually *wanted* to hang out again. We even had a group cooking night last week, and for the first time in ages, the compost bin wasn't overflowing.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

The concrete walls widened into the hidden garage beneath the estate, rows of dark machines gleaming in the dim security lights. As the gate rumbled shut behind her, Minerva let the engine idle, the low hum filling the cavernous space.

She killed the motor and climbed out, case in hand, boots echoing as she crossed the floor toward the lair’s central chamber. The scanner plate glowed faintly, waiting. She set the device down, machinery humming to life, a thin beam sweeping its surface.

The elevator chimed. Elizabeth stepped out, her stride measured, her coat neatly draped across her arm. Her eyes swept over Minerva, pausing on the blood trailing down her sleeve and dripping onto the polished concrete.

Elizabeth arched a brow.
“I do hope you realize you’re bleeding all over my clean floors, Miss Filleas. I spent the better part of the morning making sure they didn’t shine like a crime scene.”

Minerva almost smiled. Almost.
“Add it to my bill.”

Elizabeth set her bag down, already pulling out gauze and antiseptic.
“Oh, I fully intend to. Sit, before you ruin my patience along with the finish.”

Minerva slid onto the stool beside the console, eyes closed as the scanner crawled across the device's surface. Strings of code began to spool across the screens, lines bending and locking behind encryption walls.

“How long?” she asked.

Elizabeth glanced at the feed.
“A few hours, at least. Whoever designed this didn’t want prying eyes.”

“Figures.” Minerva’s voice was flat. Hours meant waiting, and waiting meant remembering.

Elizabeth tugged on gloves, tilting Minerva’s chin toward the light.
“You should have called ahead.”

“Didn't think you would help me in this,” Minerva murmurs wincing as antiseptic burn into her skin.

Elizabeth dabbed carefully, expression cool but voice edged with steel. “Clearly you need me to survive out there. You act like nothing can touch you, but the truth—” she glanced at the smear of blood on her cloth, “—always comes home with you.”

Minerva leans back in her chair, her eyes still shut. And the memory came.

---

It wasn’t the battlefield this time. It was a gray government office, walls lined with filing cabinets that smelled faintly of dust and stale coffee. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, flat and merciless, casting no shadows to hide in.

Minerva sat across from a clerk whose gaze never rose above the screen, fingers tapping in a steady, indifferent rhythm.

“Corporal Jansen,” she said, voice clipped but trembling beneath the steel. “He died in service. His family needs—”

The clerk cut her off, monotone smooth as glass.
“His designation was non-essential. Benefits are reserved for qualifying dependents. This case does not qualify.”

Minerva leaned forward, fists tight, knuckles bone-white against the edge of the desk. Her chest burned, a knot of fury and helplessness twisting tighter with each word.
“His wife is raising three children alone. He bled for this country. Don’t you dare tell me that doesn’t qualify.”

The clerk never looked up. Never faltered. Just clicked, typed, stamped.
A single line appeared on the screen: Request denied.

That was it.
A man’s sacrifice turned into paperwork.
A family written off like an accounting error.

Minerva’s breath caught, rage clawing its way up her throat. She wanted to slam her fists through the desk, rip that screen from its hinges—but all she could do was sit there, teeth clenched, while the machinery of indifference ticked on.

---

“Minerva.” Elizabeth’s voice cut through. She was binding Minerva’s arm with precise, efficient movements.

Minerva exhaled, forcing the memory down. On the console, the scanner chimed softly, still crawling through layers of encryption.

Elizabeth stripped off her gloves, folding them neatly.
“This will take hours. Which means you, Miss Filleas, will have time to recover. And you had best make use of it — your family’s charity luncheon is tomorrow afternoon, and if you show up looking like the walking dead, tongues will wag.”

Minerva glanced at her, the corner of her mouth twitching despite the heaviness in her chest.
“You’re worried about appearances?”

“I’m worried about keeping your cover intact,” Elizabeth replied crisply. “Your war in the shadows is one thing. But society will notice if the heiress looks like she’s been wrestling alley cats.”

Minerva let out a tired, dry laugh.
“Fine. I’ll try to look alive.”

“Good.” Elizabeth smoothed her coat with perfect precision. “Because I have no interest in explaining bloodstains to your father.”

Her reflection in the console glass wavered — fractured, tired, unrelenting. For just a moment, she thought she saw Jansen’s widow clutching a rejection letter instead of the folded flag she deserved.

Volunteering and looking for a community. It's been over 10 years and I no longer practice religion. And it all started with this one pastor. Let's call him Dirty Dan. Let's do a quick recap.

He made me feel terrible. Not good enough. Not godly enough. And tried to personally hurt our family.

I was on the inner circle of this small church. He was eventually fired as pastor for having an affair on his wife. Multiple affairs. And after he was fired, we realized he had a pull out couch in the church office that he'd use for his shenanigans.

Years later he tried running for Mayor to make (small town) great again and to fix our roads and fix the potholes. It flopped heavily. Because the rumours were starting to spread. Affairs. D pics to young women AND teens. People were even taking his mayor signs.

My friend was his neighbour and a group of guys came to his house one night yelling at him and wanting to fight him to stop sending pics and messages to girls and young women.

After this, he tried managing local chain restaurants and was fired for coming onto teens and young women.

He somehow managed to create his own mini coffee shop with the help of his, at-the-time girlfriend, who likely did all the work, branding etc. He was cheating on her too. Surprise, surprise. 

And 2 days ago, he started a petition to try and cancel our towns annual Witches Walk because it goes against the charter of rights for 'religious affiliation'. The witches walk is for fun, and to raise food for a local food bank, days before halloween. And has no religious or pagan affiliation lol.

In the last 48 hours the best revenge could've happened. His own dirty laundry is all of a sudden being aired by everyone. People are boycotting his business who didn't know the kind of guy he was. The witch walk has doubled in people wanting to attend. Others are sharing photos from ""are we dating the same guy"" with Dirty Dan's photos with comments upon comments saying ""RUN"". 

And a ""poking fun"" article was written about him and it's TOO funny not to share (It is a satire account but most of what is written is true, just the wording has more of a comedic flare)

# Local Business Owner Tries to Cancel Witches Walk, But Everyone Likes It More

Small town – In what some are calling “the spookiest move of the season,” a local business owner has launched a petition demanding the Town withdraw its support for the Witches Walk, an annual downtown event that raises funds for our Food Bank and is beloved by just about everyone else.  
  
The business owner, who for legal reasons we’ll just call Definitely Not Beloved, claims the town’s sponsorship violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, since witchcraft is technically a recognized religious practice.  
  
“By endorsing a Witches Walk, the Town is forcing all of us to convert to paganism against our will,” said Not Beloved, adjusting their glasses and clutching a copy of the Charter like a wooden stake. “What’s next, a Zombie Parade that infringes on the rights of the living?”  
  
The argument has not landed well with locals, who seem less concerned about constitutional law and more excited about an excuse to dress up, drink cider, and throw money at The Food Bank.“  
  
It’s a great event for a great cause,” said one shopkeeper, busy hanging glittery broomsticks in her window. “I’m not sure what that guy’s problem is, but frankly, the only thing scarier than witches is his Yelp reviews.”  
  
Town officials, meanwhile, appeared bewildered by the controversy. “We just thought it would be fun and raise money for food security,” said one councillor. “But if the Canadian Charter now forbids us from having fun, we’ll need to cancel Halloween, Christmas, and probably Tuesday as well.  
  
”Ironically, the petition seems to have boosted interest in the event. Attendance is expected to double this year, with one resident noting, “I wasn’t going to go, but now I’m definitely showing up with a pointy hat and a cauldron just to annoy that guy.”  
  
Food Bank confirmed that every dollar raised will go directly back into helping the community — and that no citizens will be required to formally pledge allegiance to the Moon Goddess in the process.

If you see this Charlotte, I listen to your vids while I work! This whole thing just felt like the best revenge. And other than telling people over the years he's not a good guy, I didn't really have to do anything. His own character revealed himself. And he's finally doing himself in.

everyone knows people can slip on banana peel jf we throw it on road, yet they do it,,,,,no literal civic sense 

Few days back, i went with my friends for a walk, we had some chips and cold drinks, while walking on the road, one of my friend threw it on road, i kept the wrapper and empty bottle and told my friend to pick it up and go back to the hostel and throw it in dustbin there, 4/5 friends laughed at me (we sre in btech first year) 
The 4/5 friends are from bihar, I'm not pointing the particular state, I'm from bihar myself but people from village /rural side are the ones who litter the most garbage on road

I live in hostel, for our meal, sometimes we have to stand in queue, i always standed in queue with 10-15 other people, meanwhile some guys just break the queue to take the meal, are we just fools to stand in the queue??? 
My roommate also broke a queue, i told him he doesnt have civic sense and he should feel sorry for it, the guy standing before me, said he also broke the queue, the both laughed at me......the basic responsibility of a human should be to not disturb another human, it's basic sense
Yet this country always fails in those cases

Even to get the film of xray, i had to go to room 10 4-5 times

Also, the amazing part, the visitors of few patient threw cold coffee cans in the room and biscuits wrappers, they had a bag, could have just carried it until they find a dustbin (the dustbin was just outside the room)

I'm going to include a trigger warning, so people will know what's involved, and yes, this conversation involves issues between LGBTQ and ""transphobia"".

I'm here crying right now because it feels like there's only ONE person who actually cares about me, and I just feel so alone. I tried sharing my story elsewhere, and when I got to a particular topic, mind you I shared it PURELY to be **transparent**, not withhold information to protect myself, suddenly everyone came down on me with only hate, totally not hearing me out, and completely disregarding ALL context I brought in, just to condemn me only.

Truth is, I'm looking for HONEST opinions that actually observe my situation, and can provide me real and genuine answers. I don't care if I really am the a$$hole in this situation, please at least see my perspective, and show me with dignity, where I am wrong, and what I should do.

So, I don't want to make this long, so I'll try to make this as short as possible.

Since childhood, my mom had her favorite and it most definitely wasn't me. My (at the time) younger brother ""Andy"" (let's say) was in my opinion, self-righteous, always put up a facade of good behavior, and constantly tattled on me and the others for the slightest things. Mom always sided with him, no matter what. Me? I was the black sheep because of my developing interests, things like foreign and banned horror films, magick, and oddities of the internet. Because of my interests, I lived my whole childhood in silence from my family, and only ever sharing myself with very, very few friends.

My dad is a complete wuss and never stands up to my mom, and my extended family often alway sided with my mom. Only on my father's side, have a few to point her favoritism out, but it never amounted to anything to help me.

I was about 18 when ""Andy"" came out as trans, changing her name to ""Liz"" (let's say), and she had my mom's full support. Dad wasn't keen on it but never made waves about it, while our other siblings visibly struggled, but mom in my honest opinion, never dealt with such changes properly. My second younger brother (calling him Abe) was really impacted and felt as though he ""lost"" his big brother, and mom only chastised him for his feelings. I know for certain if it was me who was trans, she'd berate me and probably have disowned me.

As I'm the eldest kid and female, Liz would suddenly decide to want have a sisterly bond. I said we could hang out in going to a movie, grabbing a coffee, or hitting the arcade. But Liz demanded we had a ""girls day out"" doing everything I absolutely HATE, from spa/nails, shopping at the mall, talking about celeb crushes, all that stuff. I TOLD her to meet me in the middle, and she's the one who refused. Liz kept asking about my ""feminine routines"" which I swiftly declined and said we can talk about cooking, personal interests, the latest upcoming films and such, but I drew a firm line when it came to matters that are very private. My mom got angry and said I needed to share these things to help Liz with her self-discovery.

Multiple instances like this came up where I TRIED to compromise and find middle ground with Liz, and mom would wholly take Liz's side saying that I'm not being a supportive sister, and that I need to basically do things I don't want to, or things I hate, just to satisfy Liz's needs. I begged mom for Liz to get friends or join some groups where she could explore things that I couldn't supply, and my mom says that I'm pushing Liz away instead of doing my part to understand her.

I asked my mom about Liz reciprocating, playing some of my video games, watching horror movies with me and such, and what's mom's response? ""That's different"", saying that my interests are ""not good"" and Liz is not obligated to delve ""in the shit"" that I'm into. That is the story of my life. Liz is ALWAYS the good one, only her needs matters, and that I should put family needs first, without anyone ever giving to me.

A lot happened for the next couple years that drove the wedge between me, my mom and sister. Liz one time wanted to share the gender spectrum with me, and I listened attentively, knowing she won't do the same for me on any front, and would label me ""cisgender"" something I told her not to, and that spawned a massive argument, which my mom condemned me for. Again, Liz is licensed to define herself as she pleases, but I'm not allowed the same respect.

About a couple years later, when I was 20, I met my now boyfriend (and crux of contention) ""Viktor"" (let's say). I met him with my few friends at a ""film"" ""convention"" that was literally held at a shady car garage. He was cold, distant, and full of quirks, but we hit off and became friends, finding so much we had in common, we began dating in secret, and for reasons I'll explain, we now live together.

My family got in wind of me dating and was all but demanding to meet my boyfriend, and I begged my mom not to, but caved and slowly introduced him with small talk and sharing a few photos of him. Liz was immediately enamored and couldn't stop talking about his looks, how lucky I was, and even asked for a three way date, and bought a skirt she felt matched his eye color (his eyes are sharp blue).

So this is where the trigger warnings come into play, and PLEASE, I'm sharing this to be **transparent**, because I'm not looking to be the ""good guy"", I'm laying everything out to see what I've done wrong. I'm literally afraid to speak on this, in fear this segment is the ONLY thing people will hone in on, and ignore all the context, and the actual problem going on.

""Viktor"" is a Russian native, who was adopted by an extremely abusive American family, whom he's left and gone NC with (and I'll go ahead and say it, I have reason to believe he was sexually abused, and he's not ready to share it). Now, he's never EVER spoken in hate against LGBTQ, just doesn't believe in it or wants to associate with it. Again, he has NEVER, said he hated others (except his adoptive family). But, I have to emphasize that he's not from a culture that is very receptive of the LGBTQ community, and that's the thing that people butchered me for, all without ANY consideration of what I'm about to say next.

Viktor IS someone who tries. Any time we encounter an LGBTQ person, he's always amiable and cordial. But he does usually avoid circumstances if he can, and at home he will discuss with me his position on things. When I told him about my trans-sister, he didn't want to up and dump me. He LISTENED, and tried to be as understanding as best he could, and said he'd put his best foot forward to be extra nice for the sake of my family.

I tried to explain this elsewhere, with many users ignoring everything to just say his a ""bigot"" and that's that, and said he's a horrible person, REGARDLESS of all the context given. And again, I'm being transparent, for help, not just condemnation with no recourse at all. But I will defend Vik as he's a victim living in a world that's not his, and is completely alone. None of the other users, took any of this into consideration.

That family dinner ended up being a big blow up, because I sat Liz down and explained Vik's situation perfectly clear and begged her to not crowd him and invade his space. She didn't listen, and Vik tried his best to be nice but she kept getting close, kept brushing against him, and constantly tapped on his shoulder, until he finally said ""don't touch me"". This led to a massive blow up that led me to leaving and moving in with him. My mom would call me heartless and said that I abandoned the family for a stranger, and abandoned my sister in her time of need.

But the reality was this; I am TIRED of being the less favorite, tired of having my mom prioritize Liz all the time, and expected me to never have boundaries, never have my feelings and needs met. Vik is the only person, who actually respects me, loves me for who I am, and after moving in with him, it's the first time I'm in a home where I can be myself. He actually has my back, while there's no one I can turn to and cry on their shoulder.

It's been a year now, and though I left, I didn't go NC. I still came for major family events and holidays, and would help pick up my younger siblings from school if I could. My second younger brother ""Abe"" actually loves Vik and sees him as a ""replacement brother"", and occasionally will hang out at our apt instead of going home.

But over the weekend my mom says I'm no longer welcomed at any family events or holidays until I learn the importance of prioritizing family. Though, this family has never prioritized me. Abe told me in text he went off at my mom and told our extended family, which actually pit everyone against each other over her decision, and mom grounded Abe over it. He's threatened to spend every holiday and event I'm not allowed, with me and Vik. It's very possible my mom and my sister Liz will call me about this, and I'm not sure what to do.

Here's where I am; I genuinely feel sorry for Liz and I WISH I could be a big sister to her. I tried, I really did, but the expectations were 100% unfair to me in my opinion. I do have personal grudges towards Liz over our childhood. We weren't close at all, and the antics that fueled our rivalry I won't lie, makes it hard to have sympathy for her. My mom sees me as a traitor and feels I abandoned the family for selfish reasons, completely invalidating my feelings of rejection from her.

My dad did try to get us into family therapy, and no one was cooperative. I'll admit to also not being cooperative, because the therapist kept telling me the first step for healing is ME being the bigger person, and ME having to extend an olive branch, which I refused, as I'm tired of being the sacrificial lamb every time.

So, I don't know what to do or where to start. I don't want return home without true acknowledgement of my side, and us meeting in the middle. I don't want to go back to having to hide my interests, hide myself and living with my mom's favoritism. My mom wants me to leave Vik, which I totally can't do. Not after everything we've been through and how much he's given me, that my mom has failed to give. At the same time, I know Liz is going through a tough time with the whole family now arguing over mom banning me, and I know she is hurt that I left and probably is feeling abandoned by me.

But I don't know what to do. Asking for genuine advice. If I am wrong, please show me with dignity and giving my circumstance consideration. Any further questions, I will gladly answer. I just want help and advice.",2,1759377323.0,InternalFamilySystems,0,1.0,False

1nvtkov,https://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/1nvtkov/a_recollection_of_an_accident_and_and_partial/,a recollection of an accident and and partial thumb amputation,"About two weeks ago, I was working on a bicycle that I had been trying to more habitually use to commute (13 flat, straight, safe miles each way, about 35 minutes, quickly becoming one of the most enjoyable parts of any day).  I was holding the frame up with my left hand having wound up the pedals with my right hand.  It was a precarious setup and I was not using one of the immediately available bicycle work stands that were within five feet.  The towel I was using got snagged in the cog and pulled my hand in.   I only needed to briefly look at the injury to know that I would be needing emergency medical care.  The initial diagnosis included a distal fracture.  The timeline gets a little foggy here as costs for care were being discussed and narcotics were also thankfully administered.  Two or three days later, I am on the surgical table with the understanding that I will undergo a known surgical fix for this type of injury (aside: wild rabbit-hole for thumb amputations - sometimes involves replacement with a toe).  I was surprised the surgery took so long to get sorted out, because I felt very leaky.  The surgery was almost moved because I had all of 8 oz of coffee at 4:20 am with a slight amount of cream when I was originally scheduled to go in around 2 pm and the procedure was moved up to like 9 or 10 am.  I was told I was a twitchy patient and anesthesia apparently had to become part of the plan.  The power of these local and other painkilling drugs is astonishing to me. 

Post op, my thumb remained bandaged for an entire week of pretty wildly painful sensations that began to subside after roughly three days.   I had been stitched up in the wrist area and also fractured my hand as I had previously banged up my right wing in two other separate incidents, so I vaguely knew what I was in for, but I still was not ready.  Looking at the aftermath of the surgical procedure (ultimately shortening the bone on the end of the thumb to the point they could repair the skin - I had roughly half of that bone cut back, what was the center of my thumb is now the tip, nailbed is likely gone) was extremely psychologically disturbing.  The wound was still pretty ""weepy"".  Dr said come back in another week, so here I am, stitches still in, with pain largely subsided and the would largely having stopped leaking anticipating getting on the other side of the physical discomfort, hoping the stiches may be ready to be out soon.

  
Off the hip observations include: this is a catastrophic injury for an individual with a high deductible plan, I may be a complete buffoon, and also a dumbass.  My most regarded friends are like ""cool story to tell the chicks, bro..."" and I am like I would do horrible things for access to time travel.  Also, I am a complete bicycling dork.  Can't remember the last time I went a week without riding.  It is part of my identity, arguably.  It has been crippling to the ego.  The only joy that I have been able to find so far is looking forward to giving people a sarcastic, fucked up looking thumbs up in traffic.  One of my favorite colleagues who is a wild anarchist left leaning gun nut wants to make me a fake wooden thumb, and I told him only if it is mesquite and only if it has a turquoise nail.  I feel like there are enough accident prone people here something similar may have happened, or I could be wrong and I should stick to nice safe things like round sheets of paper without any corners, crayons and gummy worms.

1nvtket,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1nvtket/what_if_the_voyagers_zipping_through_space_is/,What if the Voyagers zipping through space is what's causing our world to slowly desync? (Another dumb simulation theory),"Think about it. In video games, to save memory, game assets only populate/render as you turn your character around, focusing only on your character's POV. Not only that but theres usually a ""Fog"" further away, preventing you from seeing too far away from where your character is currently at. (Or the game will start lagging/slowing down/glitching/etc.)

Now imagine the two Voyagers, zooming at high speeds in different directions somewhere off in space. The further they get, the more ""memory"" they're using up, since our so called simulation has to render everything in front of them as they're zipping through space. Now comes the passive glitches.

People complaining about time moving faster then it did years ago.
Is time moving faster? Or is our simulation constantly pausing every single thing at the same time due to the two Voyagers rendering everything in front of them, and basically throttling our simulated world. Since everything is paused at the same time, no one (humans/animals/plants/misc non-living objects)  notices that time was actually skipped. So when everything unpauses and resumes like normal, it just feels like the day went by fast when in ""reality"", we were all frozen for a certain amount of time as our simulated world loaded up the next batch of assets into our consciousness all at once.

Short term memory loss/ Mandela effect / Deja vu / happening a lot more recently in the past few years? No its not your fault. Its the Voyagers zooming through space, throttling our simulated servers. The simulation is just choosing to focus more on rendering whatever objects the Voyagers are seeing instead. (I mean face it. All humans are stuck on a rock and not able to leave it. The simulation doesn't have to put too much effort since we're all stuck. Might as well focus on creating new objects for the two interstellar objects zipping through space instead of the billions that are all located on one rock.)

Feeling like the world is going downhill? Well duh, like previously stated, the two Voyagers are slurping up all our simulated worlds memory for themselves. And like any new released game. If you don't update your current system specs, you'll either be playing the new game on extremely low settings, or lagging like crazy trying to play on normal settings. I'm thinking we're at the stage where the world is going downhill, because there are no more new updates/patches to our simulated world. Whoever/Whatever created our simulated world, decided to take a coffee break or something and just left our server on. Probably thought that these human species thingys that were created, were already modified/revised/updated enough to probably run the world by themselves.

And he/she/it/that/what/who was correct. Our simulated world was running flawlessly for basically forever with bad/cheap system specs...until the humans decided to launch two things deep into space, causing our simulated world to allocate more and more memory to those two objects, as they continue zipping deeper and deeper into space. 


Tldr version: we're just NPC chilling on a floating rock, and things were going good until we made our own servers lag by chucking stuff far away.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1759376680.0,obschevy,1,1.0,False

In PKD, the kidneys are already stressed by cyst growth, so keeping the body’s acid–base balance more “alkaline” may help protect kidney function.

Main principles:
	•	Eat more plant-based foods: fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds.
	•	Limit acid-forming foods: red meat, processed meats, cheese, eggs, refined sugar.
	•	Choose plant-based proteins (to reduce kidney burden) such as lentils, beans, chickpeas, tofu.
	•	Reduce sodium/salt (too much sodium raises blood pressure and damages kidneys).
	•	Prefer whole foods over processed ones.
	•	Drink enough water to support kidney function.
	•	Limit animal fats and fried foods, as they increase inflammation.
	•	Avoid soda, fast food, and highly processed snacks, which are strongly acid-forming.

Good options (alkaline-forming):
	•	Leafy greens (spinach, kale, arugula)
	•	Broccoli, zucchini, cucumber, celery
	•	Avocado, berries, apples, pears, melons
	•	Almonds, chia seeds, flax seeds (in moderation)
	•	Herbal teas, lemon water (lemon becomes alkaline after metabolism)

To limit (acid-forming):
	•	Red meat, sausages, cold cuts
	•	Cow’s milk, cheese, cream
	•	White bread, pastries
	•	Coffee, alcohol
	•	Too much fish/seafood (though better than red meat, still acid-forming in excess)

1nvt9ge,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1nvt9ge/something_is_wrong_with_wendigoon_real/,Something is wrong with Wendigoon!! (Real),"When I read this week's episode title it really got my hopes up that it was going to be a creepcast creepypasta and I was sorely disappointed when I listened to over an hour of familial abuse torture instead. So here is my creepcast creepy pasta, enjoy!

Hello, I am posting this to reddit because I am not sure where else to go. My name is Turnk... and no one believes my story. 

It was an unseasonably cold October night. I was awake at 3 am, this was normal for me as I work a night shift job and routinely stay up until the sun comes up. I was mindlessly scrolling, letting my brain melt away to the endless sea of movie clips on YouTube shorts when I saw a familiar notification pop up on my screen. It was a notification from the CreepCast YouTube channel! ""Nice"" I thought to myself ""Finally something to cure my boredom.""

I clicked on the video as quickly as I could. (It did not occur to me until later that 3am was not a usual time their videos would go live.) When I opened the video I saw a strange title, it read. ""The Execution Of Papa Meat"", I stared in bewilderment. ""What?"" I said out loud. I took a further scan of the video when I saw it had 0 views! ""Guess I'm the first one to watch the new episode!"" I thought to myself excitedly. 

I clicked play and the normal CreepCast intro played, it opened with Hunter and Isaiah together in person. ""Wow these are always my favorite episodes, getting to see my favorite creators interact in person is such a treat!"" I thought fangirling to myself. As soon as they began talking I could tell something was wrong, Hunter had this 1000 yard stare on his face while Isaiah looked into the camera with enthusiasm. (I swear his lips were bigger than normal) 

Isaiah began speaking, ""Hello everyone, today we have something different for you. Today we will be executing Hunter."" ""What!!?"" I thought to myself, surely this was some kind of joke. Isaiah then pulls out a comically large saw, the kind lumberjacks use to saw through large oak trees, and with a smile too large for his face speaks ""But first, why don't we have a little fun!"" Hunter just stares into the camera, as if his eyes could plead for mercy.

I watched in horror as Isaiah tied Hunter to his chair, with surprisingly little protest from Hunter. Isaiah then took a deep breath and began saying through Hunter's foot, I could not believe what I was seeing. Hunter's facial features did not change at all, he just stared into the Camera with a blank expression. I think I may have seen the distinct twinkle of a tear beginning to form in the corner of Hunter's left eye. 

After 5 minutes of gruesome sawing, Isaiah stood up in Triumph, Hunter's foot in hand. ""Hooray!"" Isaiah touted in Triumph as blood was seeping from Hunter's leg like a leaky faucet. When Isaiah looked back at the camera, his lips had grown in size, they were now at the corner of his jaws.

I had to get answers, this couldn't be real. I paused the video and went to the comments immediately, but there were none left. I refreshed the page thinking it was some sort of bug but to my horror, there were still 0 comments. Was I the only one to had seen this video? I frantically went to the CreepCast subreddit, surely there were people talking about this new video, but to my horror the subreddit was nowhere to be found. 

I didn't know what else to do, I figured the only place left for answers was just that. The video. When I went back to YouTube I was greeted with a horrible sight, Isaiah's face was right in front of the Camera staring directly into it. Before I even had the chance to hit play he spoke, somehow speaking while the video was paused. ""What do you think? Ms. Brownie?"" I felt my heart sink into my stomach as if it was dropped off a balcony. How, how was any of this happening? How did he know my name, how did the video start playing? 

I shut off my phone as fast as I could, this has to be some sort of prank. None of this could be real. I didn't know what to do, do I call the police? And say what exactly, that I was watching some creepy YouTube video and decided to call? I decided to just lay back down, maybe I was just tired. Maybe these years of night shift work are finally catching up to me. 

I decided getting back on my phone was a bad idea, so I picked up one of my favorite books instead to pass the time until I felt like I could fall asleep. I began reading to calm my nerves when I was abruptly interrupted to the sound of knocking on the front door, I nearly let out a scream in fear. The knocking sounded frantic, like someone needed help. On the account of me having watched that video and generally being paranoid, I slowly crept my way to the door as to hopefully not alert the person at the door that I was home.

When I got to the door, as quietly as I could I peeked into the peephole and saw... no one? I was confused the knocking has only just stopped, probably half a second before I looked through the peep hole? I looked out and saw no one, but a large package was left on my doorstep. Fuck that I thought to myself, I am not becoming the stereotypical horror movie character and opening my door right now. I decided I would go back to my room and sleep until morning before seeing what the package was about.

I made it back to my room and was able to sleep with no incident, but I was having this terrifying dream. I was in my room laying in my bed, but I couldn't move. I watched as my door slowly crept open as if it was trying to not make a sound. As soon as the door opened enough for a sliver of my hallway light to creep through, I saw it. Lips. Large, pink, grotesque lips started slowly shifting their way into my room. 

I was petrified, I tried so desperately to move but it was like someone had woven me into a spider's web. After the lips had been slowly moving into my room for what felt like an eternity, I saw the distinct face of Isaiah fade into my view. As soon as his eyes met mine, I jolted awake, it felt like someone had dumped a bucket of cold water on me to wake me up. My heart pounded in my chest, banging against my rib cage like it wanted out. 

I went about my morning as normal, when I remembered what happened the night before. Had I dreamt all of that? Was any of that real? I checked the CreepCast channel on my phone and was pleasantly surprised to see no new upload on their channel. Must have all been some strange dream, I really need to get a different job. As I was sitting in my living room enjoying my morning coffee, I smelled something. Something rotting. 

I tried to locate the smell, and when I finally did it brought me straight to my front door. I opened my door to investigate, and thats when I saw it. The package on my doorstep. My brain full of confusion, ""So was it real? Was it all real?"" The only way for me to know was to bring the package inside and see what was in it. The package was heavy, and damp. The foul odor escaped the sides of the package as if it were trying to escape it's confinement.

I plopped the package on to my table and opened it. In horror I saw Hunter's head staring right back at me, the same blank expression he was making in the video. His mouth laid agape and his eyes were empty. I screamed in horror, I immediately closed the box and ran to my bathroom, locked myself in and called the police. 

""911 where's your emergency?"" The comforting voice of the dispatcher spoke. ""Hello yes this is Turnk, I live on 1738 patch lane, please send an officer someone left a head on my front porch."" ""Alright ma'am stay calm I am sending an officer right away"" she spoke, but I felt something was off with her voice. It sounded, like someone with a southern accent doing an impression of a woman. I decided to ignore it. ""Thank you"" I spoke in a shakey tone. ""How soon should I be expecting them?"" A familiar voice then spoke to me through the phone. ""You know no one is coming to save you right?"" The distinct high pitched southern voice of Isaiah spoke to me.


My phone fell from my ear to the bathroom tiles. I heard the maniacal laughter of Isaiah come from my phone, before the tone of a dropped phone call could be heard from it. I tried to turn on my phone but it was somehow dead, my charger was outside my bathroom and I definitely was not going out there to get it. So there I sat, on my bathroom floor waiting for whatever the hell was going to happen to happen. At that point I accepted my fate.


3 hours must have passed with me sitting alone in my bathroom when I heard the distinct sound of my front door opening, I already knew who it was. I heard the footsteps grow closer and closer to my bathroom door, I closed my eyes and hoped it would be quick. I heard 2 slow knocks on my bathroom door, and the southern twinkish voice called out to me. ""Come out Turnk, I know you're in there.""

The door rattled as Isaiah began trying to open the door with force, luckily in my panicked state I remembered to lock it. Just then I heard a voice call out to me from my bathroom closet. ""Psst in here"" it spoke, I felt like I had heard the voice before. I opened the closet confused, half expecting Isaiah to be standing behind it somehow ready to cut my head off next, but instead I saw Hunter's head full of life, speaking to me somehow. 

""Turnk, I know this is crazy and I know I am just a head but I need you to listen to me."" ""What the fuck"" I said in shock. Hunter spoke again ""Stay quiet, or else he will hear us"" I decided to just fully give in to my madness, if I I was under the assumption that an evil paranormal wendigoon was trying to kill me, I may as well also believe Hunter's severed head was also speaking to me. ""What is happening?"" I asked the severed head of Hunter. He spoke ""I don't have time to explain like all those shitty horror stories we read that over explain the whole plot, but I do know what to do to fix this."" ""Ok what do we do?"" I asked. ""I need you to open the door and hold me towards him, I'll take care of the rest heh"" he said with a smirk as if he wasn't a decapitated head. ""Ok"" I said ""I'll trust you on this, but if we get killed I am totally unsubscribing from the patreon!"" 

I grabbed Hunter's head by his hair and held him like a lantern. Isaiah has stopped banging on the bathroom door, but I could tell he was still outside the door. I could hear his breaths pursed through his gigantic malformed lips. I open the door in an instant and thrust Hunter's head forward as fast as I could. What stood before me was a grotesque image of what Wendigoon once was. His limbs were bent like broken branches in the winter, his eyes were smaller than dimes. His hair was shaped in a bowl cut and his lips... by God his lips. They were so large they were drooping on to my hallway floor. But before I could process what I was seeing, a light shown from Hunter's head. Hunter let out a scream, a scream I had heard 1000 times before on CreepCast, and like that they were gone.

I stood in my bathroom holding my hand in front of me as if I was trying to hold a lantern that didn't exist. I searched my apartment for any trace of what just occurred, the only thing I could find was the box Hunter's head came in and a note inside. ""Farewell Turnk Brownie"" written in what looks like Crayon.

So now I post this to Reddit, no one believes my story. I just wanted to get it out there, so that someone, somewhere may believe me, but I've never shaken the paranoia from that day. Sometimes at night, when I am all alone and trying to fall asleep. I still feel like I can hear the breathing of someone with abnormally large lips coming from my closet.",1,1759376172.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

I felt like I was just healing and now he texted me that he is still in the process of missing me. I didn’t respond first. Then he sent me a picture of him and a baby on his arm (from his family) and he asked me to meet up over coffee to “catch up”. I said it’s not a good idea but he keeps insisting now. 
He also sent a message and deleted it again. 

I broke up with him bc we couldn’t talk normal in fights and never came to solutions. I even gave him another chance before, it lastet 5 dates and we ended in the same fights. He just doesn’t listen to me when I feel insecure. And I don’t trust him. 

We are both blocked on Insta but with a fake profile I saw he added already 10-20 new girls in the no contact period - they are all from our city and he probably met them in parties. 

And now he comes back? I cannot believe it. What’s his problem. I feel I need to block him. I don’t want to but this is so bad for me. I feel I got all set back. It’s 5am right now, I can’t sleep. I miss him as well but I know we are not good for each other.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

About 3 years ago, I experienced the worst date of my life. It was a coffee date, and went off the rails before I could open my mouth. Sneering, yelling, eye rolling, belittling remarks, every hurtful act she could think of. When I offered a snack from the display she snapped ""I DONT EAT THAT!!"" as loud as she could in the middle of the line. The date ended in about fifteen minutes, with her waving her arms and screaming about how humiliating it must be for me to have a girl to storm off early like that. 

Luckily, nothing anywhere near that bad has happened to me before or since, and judging from how she treated mutual friends I don't think I was alone in my experience.  

The only issue is that she still eats away at me. Therapy's cleared out some of the nastier effects and helped mitigate the more persistent symptoms. I *know* I shouldn't take what happened personally. I know what happened was about her and I happened to be bystander to whatever she was dealing with. 

But I still feel a bizarre mix of guilt and shame over what happened. I haven't dated since, partly out of fear of something like that happening again, and partly because I'm stuck in the belief that she somehow tainted me; that her actions somehow disqualify me in the minds of all women and completely strips me of any ability to attract a partner. I wonder: what if she cursed me somehow? What if she saw something in me that set her off? Something horrendous? As irrational as these thoughts are when verbalized, for some bizarre reason they *feel* as certain and true as gravity. 

The years since have been better. I've lost weight, worked out, did loads of skin/hair/whatevercare, even overhauled my wardrobe (it was pretty bad). I've got a fair bit going for me: still a prime 24 years old, good cook, happy with my looks, even dated one or two great people before the incident. Against me is a mountain of insecurity, social anxiety, my meager height of 175cm and ears that stick out a fair bit more than I'd like. As far as dating goes:

* I'd like to start with apps. I know Reddit *loves* to whine about these. I'm in Canada where the game's a fair bit easier, and my male IRLs all speak positively of the apps. I've ample evidence that good photographs, detachment, a fair bit of iteration and a dash of game theory is enough to outperform a good 85% of dudes. But I'm still a bit worried that I won't perform well.
* And possibly put myself out there in person. Best thing to do seems to be having an agnostic attitude, making friends as a goal and testing the waters for more in due accordance with the other party's signals.

 Only issue is that I just can't bring myself to talk to women. I've been out of the game for years at this point, and still get a nagging feeling that that fact makes me a bit of a loser. I can do platonic talk fine, but anything romantic just petrifies me. It's largely shame - the Frankenstein's monster complex of believing my interest/presence is offensive despite a lifetime of evidence to the contrary. I don't fear rejection - I've been on both sides of it and know not to take it personally. But I'm **terrified** of contempt: sneers, anger, rolled eyes, ""ewww""s, etc.

So that said, it's all a jumble. On a rational level I know I should be fine. But I still feel like that maniac kicked me out of the dating pool entirely, and fight-or-flight is always quick to remind me of that. I've spent years wondering *why* that girl blew up so badly, and honestly don't know if I can even try to date before I have an answer. So, that said:

* Is dating even possible for me at this point?
* Apps are my main option - are these worthwhile? (for this, please be constructive. It's mean to say, but I've heard enough empty complaints from dudes still rocking bathroom selfies)
* Is there something, *anything,* to make what happened make sense? ",1,1759375952.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I worked at an airport Peet’s Coffee as a barista for 10 months, and a while after I started working at a Kung Fu Tea as a barista, and in February I became a shift lead (over there basically a supervisor with some managerial duties). I’ve been there for almost 2.5 years now. Anyways, back to my post; one of the locations finally got back to me and I scheduled an interview, what should I be expecting? Especially as an external hire. I’ve noticed this sub doesn’t like externals due to them being unexperienced but I feel like my barista experience would be irrelevant at sbx. At my current job we mostly do boba & barely get coffee orders, and it’s been a while since I’ve been an actual barista. Any tips? I think with training and patience it should be good.

1nvsxj9,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1nvsxj9/foodairbnb_advice_for_tokyo/,Food/Airbnb advice for Tokyo,"Wrapping up a 5 day trip to Tokyo and thought I’d share some advice that may be contradictory to some of the popular opinions on this sub.

First off, this sub was very helpful when planning my trip, thank you to everyone for sharing your advice and hopefully this post helps someone else in the future. 


Restaurant reservations: it seems like most people on here don’t recommend worrying about reservations. As someone who prioritizes food experiences while traveling I don’t necessarily agree. There is good food everywhere in Tokyo, but the great food requires a little more leg work. And the best experiences typically require a reservation.

We only booked one reservation during our 5 day trip to keep our options open, but I wish I would’ve booked one more. The reservation we made was for a small sushi restaurant omakase course and it was truly one of the best meals I’ve ever had, and the price was reasonable.

The places we randomly found were all good, but the ones we searched harder for on Tabelog and went out of our way for were outstanding. Also, places that require reservations sometimes allow walkins for lunch.

When planning your trip check out some restaurants you’re interested in and make a reservation when you can. Some open a month in advance some as short as a week in advance.


Michelin: it seems like most people on here think Michelin restaurants are unattainably expensive, but those are mostly the star designations. The Michelin guide also has a Bib Gourmand designation, which are high quality restaurants for an affordable price. 

Tokyo has more Michelin restaurants than any other city, and throughout the world the Bib Gourmand restaurants have never let me down (I can’t say the same about some one stars I’ve been to). Tabelog can be overwhelming with the number of options, the Michelin guide can help you narrow it down.

All the Bib Gourmand restaurants we went to in Tokyo were incredible, but most require a reservation (see section above)


Airbnb: most people on here seem to recommend staying in a hotel. We were traveling as a group of 4 and found a spacious Airbnb in Meguro for cheaper than two hotel rooms. Staying in a residential area like Meguro was such a relief after trudging through the packed touristy areas all day. We were close to the Meguro station and had so many options for food, coffee shops (that opened early), & konbinis.

We were the only tourists we saw in Meguro and it really felt like we got a better feel for what it’s like to live in Tokyo. The Japanese shower room was incredible, I need to figure out how to install one at home. And having a laundry machine was great!

The one downside is not being able to forward your luggage if you’re traveling with a lot of bags. We packed a carry-on sized suitcase and backpack each and had no problem navigating the subway with both of those. We all felt like we could’ve packed lighter.


Sad to be leaving, already planning the next trip

What questions should I ask Joby?   Summary from suggestions so far, as of Wednesday Oct 1:

I will give them a list of questions, because except for the first two, they probably won’t answer anything:

When can you provide some swag for the Joby supporters?  Like T shirts, coffee cups, or maybe Corgi-like models of the S4? (Maybe 3D printing on Thingiverse?)

Can you provide tours for the supporters?

The most popular question on my subreddit is payload. When do you have to prove you can lift 1000 pounds? Will you prove it earlier?  Can you give a timeline?

What are your expectations for ramping up manufacturing in 2026, 2027 and 2028?

What are the prospects for Toyota building aircraft?  When?

How big will EVTOLs be in defense, really? How will they be used?  480 light helicopters have been purchased by the US Army for $5-8 million each, over the last 20 years. Could Joby replace these? What else would Joby's be used for in the armed forces, especially the hybrids?

Did anyone from Joby go to the Shenzen conference Sept 22/23? What do you think of China as a competitor?

What are your Dubai vertiport launches coming up, and number of aircraft they will need?

Who will be first country after EAU and US?   Japan?

Who will be the second city in US after NYC?  Los Angeles?

Knott’s Boardwalk is consumed by CarnEVIL, where the freak show never ends and the midway belongs to the clowns. These twisted jesters aren’t here for laughs—they crave screams, chaos, and your undivided attention. As you wander through the fog-filled midway, you’ll be surrounded by a swarm of deranged performers, grotesque sideshow acts, and sinister smiles that hide something far more dangerous.  
  
Prepare yourself for a nightmare carnival where funhouse horrors come alive, every corner hides a lurking clown, and escape feels impossible. The more you resist, the more the CarnEVIL thrives. Step into the spotlight… and become part of the show.  
  
💀 Part of Knott’s Scary Farm 2025, California’s largest and most haunting Halloween event.  
  
Nightmares have been revealed, and the fog has settled on the 2025 Knott’s Scary Farm event with a chilling lineup of mazes, scare zones, and shows. This year brings two new haunted experiences: The Zoo, where abandoned animal enclosures have been transformed into a laboratory of horrifying animal-human experiments, and Mary — The Haunting of Worth Home, a terrifying journey through a haunted house with dark secrets lurking behind every mirror. As announced at Midsummer Scream, both The Grimoire and Mesmer: Sideshow of the Mind return for their final year, making this your last chance to experience them. Popular returning mazes include Eight Fingers Nine: The Boogeyman, Widows, Room 13, Cinema Slasher, The Chilling Chambers, and Origins: The Curse of Calico. Fans will also encounter familiar frights in scare zones such as Ghost Town Streets, The Gore-ing 20’s, Carnevil, Forsaken Lake—complete with its haunting Funeral Procession—and The Gauntlet, which has returned with a fresh new twist.  
  
In addition to the mazes and scare zones, Knott’s Scary Farm 2025 features a variety of live shows and seasonal offerings. Guests can laugh and scream at The Hanging: There’s a New Tariff in Town, be mystified by Conjurers at the Bird Cage Theater, or be dazzled by dark carnival acts in Le Magnifique Carnaval du Grotesque on the Calico Mine Stage. Beyond the scares, fans can also explore Into the Fog: A Scary Farm Tribute Art Show, check out props and history in the Legacy Store and Museum, or enjoy seasonal overlays like the Halloween Hootenanny on Timber Mountain Log Ride. Special event extras include the return of No Boo Necklaces for those who want a scare-free experience, Haunt Lanterns with over 100 interactive activations throughout the park, and special appearances by The Boulet Brothers on select nights.  
  
Knott’s Scary Farm 2025 runs for 30 fright-filled nights from September 18 through November 1, with hours from 7:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays and until 1:00 a.m. on select Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays. Tickets range from single-night admission starting at $64 to all-inclusive VIP packages, with options such as the Scary Farm Pass, Boo-fet dining, Fright & Fast Lane, and the Very Important Monster Tour. With over 1,000 monsters roaming the fog, terrifyingly creative mazes, immersive scare zones, and a legacy spanning more than 50 years, Knott’s Scary Farm continues to reign as the largest and longest-running Halloween theme park event in Southern California.

After the devastating 6.9 magnitude earthquake last September 30, 2025 with its epicenter in Bogo City-so close to Tabogon-our hometown has been deeply affected. Tabogon is more than just a place; it's a home filled with memories and people we love. It breaks my heart to see it wrecked by this calamity.

As of now, Tabogon has no electricity, no running water, and no drinking supply. We are humbly asking for your help-whether through bottled water, canned goods, or any form of support.

Your kindness will be a light of hope for the people of Tabogon in this difficult time.",1,1759373615.0,u_Zealousideal-Run714,0,1.0,False
1nvselv,https://youtu.be/rYqLTjGXSv4,ROOM 13 KNOTT’S SCARY FARM 2025 HAUNTED HOUSE,"Step back into the dark days of Prohibition, where the Blind Tiger speakeasy once promised music, dancing, and hidden indulgence. But behind the closed doors of this jazz-filled hideaway, a series of gruesome murders shatters the party. At the center of the madness is a dangerously addictive cocktail known only as The Devil’s Elixir—a drink that twists minds, poisons souls, and leaves nothing but blood in its wake.  
  
Your search for answers leads to the legendary Argive Hotel, a glamorous yet sinister landmark on Memory Lane. Guests who dare to check in rarely make it out alive. Inside its lavish halls lurk horrifying secrets—rooms crawling with shadows, whispers in every corridor, and hosts who are far from human.  
  
Can you resist the pull of The Devil’s Elixir, or will you join the lost souls who’ve fallen victim to the Argive Hotel’s eternal nightmare?  
  
Room 13 is one of Knott’s Scary Farm’s most immersive haunted mazes, blending 1920s Prohibition-era style with horrifying supernatural terror. Enter if you dare… but beware: every hallway could be your last.  
  
Nightmares have been revealed, and the fog has settled on the 2025 Knott’s Scary Farm event with a chilling lineup of mazes, scare zones, and shows. This year brings two new haunted experiences: The Zoo, where abandoned animal enclosures have been transformed into a laboratory of horrifying animal-human experiments, and Mary — The Haunting of Worth Home, a terrifying journey through a haunted house with dark secrets lurking behind every mirror. As announced at Midsummer Scream, both The Grimoire and Mesmer: Sideshow of the Mind return for their final year, making this your last chance to experience them. Popular returning mazes include Eight Fingers Nine: The Boogeyman, Widows, Room 13, Cinema Slasher, The Chilling Chambers, and Origins: The Curse of Calico. Fans will also encounter familiar frights in scare zones such as Ghost Town Streets, The Gore-ing 20’s, Carnevil, Forsaken Lake—complete with its haunting Funeral Procession—and The Gauntlet, which has returned with a fresh new twist.  
  
In addition to the mazes and scare zones, Knott’s Scary Farm 2025 features a variety of live shows and seasonal offerings. Guests can laugh and scream at The Hanging: There’s a New Tariff in Town, be mystified by Conjurers at the Bird Cage Theater, or be dazzled by dark carnival acts in Le Magnifique Carnaval du Grotesque on the Calico Mine Stage. Beyond the scares, fans can also explore Into the Fog: A Scary Farm Tribute Art Show, check out props and history in the Legacy Store and Museum, or enjoy seasonal overlays like the Halloween Hootenanny on Timber Mountain Log Ride. Special event extras include the return of No Boo Necklaces for those who want a scare-free experience, Haunt Lanterns with over 100 interactive activations throughout the park, and special appearances by The Boulet Brothers on select nights.  
  
Knott’s Scary Farm 2025 runs for 30 fright-filled nights from September 18 through November 1, with hours from 7:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays and until 1:00 a.m. on select Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays. Tickets range from single-night admission starting at $64 to all-inclusive VIP packages, with options such as the Scary Farm Pass, Boo-fet dining, Fright & Fast Lane, and the Very Important Monster Tour. With over 1,000 monsters roaming the fog, terrifyingly creative mazes, immersive scare zones, and a legacy spanning more than 50 years, Knott’s Scary Farm continues to reign as the largest and longest-running Halloween theme park event in Southern California. This year’s lineup proves once again why Knott’s remains a must-visit destination for horror fans and thrill seekers ready to face their darkest fears.

1nvsdfa,https://www.reddit.com/r/A1HealthReviews/comments/1nvsdfa/reddit_this_is_the_knee_swellinginflammation/,"Reddit, this Is the Knee Swelling/Inflammation protocol that's been working for me (4 Months)","So I'm dropping this here because three months ago I was in a really frustrating spot with my knee, and I know some of you are dealing with similar issues. This is what actually worked for me after trying a bunch of stuff that didn't.

I'm 34, been dealing with chronic knee inflammation for about 3 years. I don’t really know what caused it, but the swelling wouldn't go away.  For 3 years, I haven't been able to squat properly or sleep properly because it’s been  uncomfortable.

I stopped messing a few months ago and found this is what helped:

On the diet front, I cut way back on inflammatory foods. No more seed oils, way less sugar, minimal processed stuff. Omega-3, about 2-3g EPA/DHA daily. 15g collagen daily mixed in coffee.And I started taking turmeric with black pepper because curcumin absorption is higher. 

For movement and recovery, I stopped all high-impact stuff for the first month. Started doing targeted mobility a few days a week which included gentle loaded stretching for the knee. 

But here's the part that I think made the biggest difference, and honestly the part I was most skeptical about - targeted red light therapy.

For red light therapy, I did it for 20minutes a day.  I had to find a flexible red light that flexes around the knee. You have to make sure the wavelength 660nm red and 850nm near-infrared and the power density is actually therapeutic levels. Otherwise you won’t get the proper photobiomodulation which increases ATP production in mitochondria, reduces cytokines, and improves circulation.

For context: we’ve only met once for coffee, and we were supposed to grab lunch before I left for a trip to Paris. Here’s how the texts went:

Him:
“I’ll have to check those out!
Also super sorry, I got called in to cover a daytime shift tomorrow so can’t make it to lunch ☹️ maybe we can do a rain check for when you get back from Paris.”
Me:
“No worries! Yah totally I am back in Boston the 13th. Also, it may be a bit hastened but if u r available today I could sneak out, it is quieter than I suspected.”
Him:
“Whoops sorry was on a run then showering just saw this! Maybe too late now but I hope you’re able to get out early!”
Me:
“No worries! Funny enough, I haven’t eaten yet 😳 so I’m technically free if you are. Otherwise Paris rain check it is!”
Him:
“It’s just a bit tight for me, maybe let’s do when you get back!” 
Me: “No worries, have a good shift at work!”

Now I’m overthinking it and feel like I came off a bit desperate or overeager by offering twice that I was free. From my perspective I was just trying to be flirty, open, and flexible with timing.
My question: If you were a guy on the receiving end, would you read this as desperate, or just as interest/availability? And for the future, should I just say it once and then leave the ball in his court?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

If you’re already a fan of Logitech’s mice (guilty 🙋‍♂️), you’ll be happy to know this thing is another solid entry. It’s basically what you’d expect: premium, feature-packed, and makes you feel like your workflow is on steroids. If you’re already a fan, you’re gonna feel right at home — and if you’ve been stuck on an older model, this is the jump you’ve been waiting for.  


But here’s the thing… it’s not some mind-blowing leap from the 3S. Think of it like upgrading from an iPhone 16 to a 17: yeah, you’ll notice some tweaks, but at the end of the day you’re still texting your mom and doomscrolling on TikTok the same way.



👉 **Who should upgrade?**



* If you’re on the MX Master 1 or 2 → do it. Massive upgrade. You’ll be like, “where has this been my whole life?”

* On the 3S? You’re fine to stick with it, but the 4 has enough new tricks that, honestly, you might start looking for excuses to buy it. It’s that “I don’t *need* it, but damn I want it” vibe.







👉 **Stuff I love:**



* The new gesture actions feel slick once you get used to them.
* It looks really good sitting on the desk — Logitech always nails the aesthetics.
* Haptic feedback = chef’s kiss.
* Side scroll wheel is smoother, feels more natural when you’re actually using it.
* Clicks are a bit quieter (your coworkers or roommates will thank you).
* Extra side button… not game-changing, but it does make the mouse feel more “multi-tool” than the 3S.



👉 **Stuff that bugs me:**



* Comfort. The 3S just molded to my hand better. With the 4, I catch myself constantly adjusting grip like I’m trying to get comfy in bed but can’t find the right pillow spot.
* The new material feels nice but also more slippery. Less “glued to my hand,” more “oops almost dropped it reaching for my coffee.”
* Shape tweaks make it feel a little less friendly for smaller/average hands. The 3S felt like it adapted to you. The 4 feels like you’re adapting to *it*.

**Bottom line:** This mouse is a *workflow weapon*. If you’re on an older MX Master, don’t think twice — this is your upgrade. If you’re on the 3S, it’s not a must-have, but it’s tempting enough that you might talk yourself into it (and you won’t regret it once you do). Logitech didn’t reinvent the wheel, but they definitely made it spin smoother.",1,1759373121.0,u_ParkingHeron8051,0,0.99,False

1nvs1ld,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1nvs1ld/failing_in_my_marriage/,Failing in my marriage,"I (41M) have been married for 11 years to my wife (37F).  We have two kids, 11 and 9.  On the serface our lives seem pretty great.  Underneath I’m frustrated, resentful and confused.

My wife and I met working for the same company.  We only dated for a few months before she got pregnant with our first kid.  We decided to move in together and bought a house with help from my parents.  Six months later I proposed and when our son was one we got married.  Looking back I ignored some red flags, but wanted a family and did my best to make it work.  We grew up in very different families.  My parents are loving supportive and generous.  Her mom has a huge heart but her dad was verbally abusive to my wife growing up and is still mean to his wife in front of us and our kids. Both sets of parents are involved in our kids lives.

For the first 6-7 years I did all our finances.  I wasn’t the best but I made sure we had everything we needed.  Bills got paid on time for the most part and I tried to communicate openly about what we could afford and not afford.  About 4 years ago I missed a couple mortgage payments and started falling behind on our finances.  I tried to fix it quietly but when my wife got a call from the mortgage company asking for a payment she was understandably livid.  She involved her employers, my parents, family friends and pastors.  I thought our marriage was ending but she took over all our finances and bank accounts and we worked through it.  For the first couple years she was amazing.  Allocating every dollar and sharing a weekly spread sheet.  I borrowed money.  We got caught up and paid everything off.  Now fast forward to today we are in the worst place financially we’ve ever been in.  We have a joint account that both our paychecks get deposited into.  I make about 75% of our monthly income.  Once each check hits she transfers out money for bills and mortgage into accounts I’m not on and don’t have access to.  Lately money has been going out but nothing is getting paid.  We’re behind on everything and she’s used up all of our reserves.  When I bring it up she says she’s getting us caught up and it will just take another month or two but it’s been about 4 months and it’s not getting better.  If I press harder she gets angry and defensive and reminds me of how I screwed up when I did the finances.  We talk about sitting down and looking at everything together but then she gets busy or tired or doesn’t feel good and it never happens.

The other issue is that I have a much stronger libido than she does.  Mostly she treats sex like a chore.  She doesn’t initiate and rejects me 8 out of 10 times.  I am very attracted to her physically but don’t enjoy sex when I feel undesired and have to beg.  About 2 years ago she bought a vibrator and hid it from me for months, then one day she told me about it and asked if I wanted to use it on her.  I was very excited and jumped right in.  She didn’t enjoy it and said it was awkward.  I asked how I could make it more enjoyable and she didn’t have an answer.  We only tried it together twice.  For a few months after that I would see it move around from our bathroom to the closet to her nightstand or under her side of the bed when I wasn’t home.  All while not having any interest in sex with me.  It really started to mess with my confidence and I brought it up a couple times.  She never wanted to talk about it and would put the issue back on me saying.  I’m sorry you feel that way, or that me feeling like I didn’t satisfy her was all in my head.  The last time I brought it up I said I feel like she’s not attracted to me and it hurts my feelings to be rejected sexually and then see she’s using a vibrator.  She got pissed! We didn’t talk for a long time and then she text saying I was being unfair and she’ll just throw it away.  I explained she didn’t need to and I’m fine with her owning it and using it, I just want to also experience intimacy with her.  Later on I apologized for being it up and she excepted.  I never saw it again and assumed she threw it away.  About a month ago I saw it in a box in our closet and noticed when I’m not home and she is it moves around.  Again I don’t mind if she uses it I just don’t understand why we aren’t having sex.  She has also said that masturbation is not cheating for women but it is for men.

We’ve done marriage counseling off and on but she mostly seems to want to fix me and not own any part of these issues.  I see a psychiatrist and psychologist on my own, but I don’t feel like it’s helping.  She is too overwhelmed to see a psychologist on her own although she says she needs to. Our last marriage counselor said she should and I feel she needs to as well.

I wake up first, make her coffee and wake her up.  While she gets ready for work I get the kids up and get them ready for school.  I make my wife a coffee to go, a protein smoothy and lunch and then she leaves.  Then I take the kids to school and go to work.  I pick the kids up from school because I work from home in the afternoons.  I help them with homework take them to extra curricular activities and then my wife gets home.  She usually sits on the couch and reads or scrolls on her phone while I make dinner.  We eat in front of the tv.  I’ve tried doing family dinners around the table several times but we always revert back to the couch and tv.  And then I clean up the kitchen while she gets ready for bed and I or we put the kids down.

My wife is not all bad.  She cleans on the weekends and always makes sure our kids have what they need.  Clothes, shoes, school supplies.  I’m not perfect either.  I can be moody, grumpy, overly emotional at times.

I just don’t know if I can keep doing this.  I feel I’m losing myself and I don’t like who I am anymore.  If I try to talk to her she says she’s the worst and a terrible wife and then I feel guilty for bringing it up.  If I don’t say anything she seems happy but I’m not.  She’s told me in so many words if I ever left her she would destroy me.  Custody, alimony, child support, all of it.  I can’t imagine losing my kids or her for that matter.  If I stay my kids have a better chance of success and she’s happy, but I’m not.  If I leave I’m not sure I’d be any happier and all their lives would be worse.  I don’t want to separate or leave.  I do love my wife and want to grow old with her.  I see moments of greatness in her.  But most of the time she seems uninterested in me except to want to improve me.  I just don’t know what to do anymore.

Recently completed a trip with a theme of 'Mountains and Lakes': 4 nights in Switzerland and 8 nights in Italy.  As this is ItalyTravel, I'll mostly talk here of the Italian portion.  Trip was from early to mid September 2025 with a group of a 4 people (two couples).  Flew into/out from Zurich and rented a car for a large loop around the alps.

Myself and my wife are very experienced Italian travelers (2+ years combined in the country, 17 of 20 regions visited in depth), however this was the first time to Italy for our friends.  This was purely meant as a hiking trip with a short diversion to wine country and the agenda performed spectacularly with the help of near-perfect weather.

**Verona and Valpolicella** \- 3 Nights

After 3 nights in Murren, Switzerland, we drove to Veneto via the Grimsel Pass, Furka Pass, St. Gottard Pass, along Lake Como, and finally a lazy final few hours cruising the A4.  This drive could be 5-6 hours if you chose an efficient route, which we explicitly avoided in favor of the windiest, most scenic cuts possible.  With numerous scenic, snack, and coffee stops this was a full-day voyage of about 10 hours.

We stayed at Agriturismo Acinatico Wine Relais on the hill above Fumane.  Wonderful accommodations and friendly staff.   After the long driving day, we had two full days in this region: the first was spent visiting various wineries in Valpolicella while the second was focused on Verona.  We purposely avoided larger wineries that export to the US - some standout experiences were the tasting/tours at Zyme and Secondo Marco.

Our day in Verona was spent wandering and doing the standard Verona things: Arena, Castelvecchio, Piazza Erbe, Castel San Pietro, simply enjoying the old streets and random churches, etc. etc.

This is a foodie area so the standouts include:

* Trattoria Caprini in Torbe for fantastic homemade tagliatelle
* Gelato Crea Verona for excellent non-tourist trap Gelato
* Enoteca della Valpolicella for the best wine-focused coursed menu dinner of the trip
* L'Evanglista Ristorante in Verona for an unforgettable special occasion dinner

**Lake Garda / Malcesine -** 2 Nights

Packed up the car and drove about 2 hours (with some traffic along the lake) to Malcesine.  Our hotel for two nights was the Hotel Garni Ischia which turned out to be the perfect place for us.  Great view of the lake and castle from a private balcony, well-appointed but distinctly European-sized rooms, and most important for us -- a large surface parking area for our car.

We chose the smaller and more frequent Garda Express boat for a trip to Limone Sul Garda, which I would highly recommend as an afternoon destination from Malcesine.  We also benefited from near ideal weather for a half-day trip up to Monte Baldo where we took advantage of numerous hiking trails.

Malcesine is a picturesque and quintessentially Italian lakefront town where you'll want to see the Castello Scaligero but most important is to not overthink your time here:  just wander the narrow cobblestone alleys, pick your favorite spot for an afternoon spritz, and generally enjoy life.

Our food in Malcesine was intentionally casual and no frills -

* Pizzeria da Pedro for good pizza and a hilarious lakefront dining experience where each boat wake may drench half the diners in water.
* Rooftop 99 Bistrot for incredible ambience, views, and personalized service (better for drinks than the food).
* ""God Save the Gelato"" L'Artigiano dei Sapori - obviously best Gelato in Malcesine (and possibly Garda)

**Seiser Alm / Compatsch** \- 3 Nights

Easy two hour drive north from Malcesine to Compatsch, where we stayed at the Seiser Alm Urthaler hotel.  This hotel was easily accessible by car at the entrance to the high elevation meadow and had an underground carpark with space for larger vehicles.

This portion of the trip was solely spent enjoying the endless hiking adventures offered in Seiser Alm and the central location near the major lifts made this hotel a dream spot.  We had half board included in our room, so our food experiences on Seiser Alm were more focused on lunch breaks on a hike.

Some highlights include:

* Hiking the Hexenbanke loop and stopping for lunch at the Arnika Hutte.
* Hiking a loop up to Punta d'Oro with lunch/after hike beers at Gostner Schwaige
* Hiking a loop including lunch at Refugio Sasso Piatto (with reportedly the best burger of the trip)

After Seiser Alm, we took another long scenic driving day to return to our flight departure and rental car return point of Zurich.

**Key Takeaways -**

* Between the Swiss and Dolomite portions of this trip we experienced some of the best hikes of our lives.  Highly recommend both Murren and Seiser Alm.
* The valleys around Seiser Alm (Val Gardena, etc.) tend to be more popular for Americans, but staying on top of the meadow itself in Compatch/Compaccio is more suited for our laid back, outdoorsy style.
* Malcesina and Seiser Alm are both heavily trafficked by German tourists.  Can be a positive - just practice up on your German if you want to make friends with fellow travelers.
* Our rental car was a BMW 5-series Wagon, which was perfect for two adult couples with plentiful space on the long driving days, but this large class of car should only be driven in this region by an experienced driver -- and advanced scouting of larger parking spaces will be required.  If you don't know what you're doing, then rent a small car.

""Buy me a Bus scam. Maybe scam, maybe not.""

I met this Thai, just before Christmas 2 years ago. One of the few who could speak English. Let's call him Joe. Joe had a shop that he sold fried chicken from, but it wasn't a good business (so he said). But he was super friendly (probably too friendly) and the first day he offered to drive me back to my hotel. And said that I could just call the next day if I wanted to go down to the beach again. I didn't do that, because I love to walk. (something Thais don't understand)

A week into our friendship, after several trips back to the hotel on his motorbike. He told me that he had lost money selling chicken on the beach, if I could lend him 3000bath.  
At first I said no, because I have always had bad experiences with that!

But in my hotel room, I thought about it, and decided to lend him the money. After 3 weeks, he wanted to have a coffee with me, he had this idea! That he should have a bus and be a taxi driver. For all the tourists. And you can probably imagine who would invest in that bus.

But I just told him that it was a bad idea, and there were too many competitors. And our friendship ended because he could not pay the 3000bath back.",0,1759372179.0,ThailandTourism,12,0.27,False

1nvrvg3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1nvrvg3/amitah_for_trying_to_move_on/,AMITAH for trying to move on?,"I am having thoughts about this situation and need some opinions on it. It is a long one and maybe a bit chaotic, so sorry about that in advance. If there’s any spelling mistakes, also sorry about that.

For a little less than a year I(f) had been dating this person (m). From the start I liked him very much and he liked me as well. It felt like coming home. He came out of a relationship, still very fresh and after a few months of dating I asked where we both stood on us. I really liked him, starting to develop stronger feelings and with keeping his mourning of his ex still in mind I wanted to make sure we were on the same page. He told me he wasn’t ready at the moment to commit or do anything more than what we already did (dates, sleeping over and seeing each other exclusively) and I told him I did want to have a relationship with him, but could wait for him to mourn his past relationship and stay in this bubble for a while. This went on for almost a year. 

After almost a year and many fights about this subject I asked him again and he told me he wasn’t ready and couldn’t give me what I asked of him, a relationship. We were still dating. Nothing changed. I told him I thought it would be best for us to end things, because I was feeling more and more sad every day with the thought this situation would never change and I also didn’t want to keep pushing him in his process of moving on from his ex. He wouldn’t let me go but wouldn’t move forward so I broke it off. It hurt really bad and I didn’t want to do that at all, but he couldn’t give me what I wanted from him and I didn’t want to give him a hard time from moving on any further. So I broke it off. 

I was upset and feeling bad, because I was mourning a breakup from a relationship that wasn’t even one, even though everything we did and how we acted says otherwise. I went on a date with someone else, almost had intercourse with them and I just couldn’t. 

I couldn’t stop thinking I was doing something wrong and went home. The date was a mutual friend of me and another friend of mine and there were some social events where we would see each other again. We met up some times after that and just talked mostly because I felt pressured to do it because of the mutual friend. I didn’t want it to get awkward or uncomfortable between us so tried to be civil. 

Short after the date, he (the long dating guy) came back to me and asked if we could try again. That he missed me and made the mistake of letting me go, he really wanted to try for the relationship this time. I never told him about the ‘friend’, because for me it wasn’t anything more than friendship (even less than that) and it happend when we weren’t together. 

I never expected him to come back for me. I gave up all hope and thought never to hear form him again. But he did and I told him multiple times no because I was scared he would hurt me again. He would just leave me in the same spot of ‘dating’ again. Eventually I said I wanted to try but couldn’t and wouldn’t do it again if it wouldn’t work out. No more chances.  Because it hurt a lot. The dating and me walking away form someone I wanted but couldn’t give me the same, hurt me. 

Now a few months later, the ‘friend’ texted me about something and he (the long dating guy) saw it on my phone. He asked me about why a guy was texting me and I told him it was a mutual friend of me and someone else. He wanted to read the chat and I let him. I didn’t delete a big part of it so you can see we talked and also that we hung out to have coffee. 

I still talked to the friend when he said he wanted to try again, saw him a few times also in social gatherings with other friends. I did tell the friend multiple times I didn’t see him in any other way than just friends so he knew.  

But now the question: am I the asshole for going on a date with the friend and keeping in touch after my ‘ex’ told me he wanted to try again? 

The only reason we still talked was because I didn’t want anything to get uncomfortable and didn’t really know what to do with the situation. 

But he found out and says I cheated on him, even though it happened because I thought I’d never see or speak to him ever again. The contact with the friend while we started talking and trying again, that had been wrong of me but I didn’t think more of him than just an acquaintance I went on a horrible date with once. 

I told him I’ve always loved him but didn’t expect him back in my life, so out of sadness and anger and trying to move on I went on a date. He wants time to think about the fact if he wants to keep on trying with me. I want to respect his choice whatever he decides because I do see that my actions have been wrong, but I did tell him I can’t wait forever again. 

I chose myself when walking away from him and made those decisions with not knowing he would come back into my life. I don’t want to lose him again, but I can’t stand the thought of him never reaching out for me again and me just waiting for an answer if he wants to keep on trying. Eventually it is his choice and I will respect whatever he decides.

It was total disaster, I’m compelled to write here to vent out disappointment and to share my experience!!

We ordered following items

1. Classic kopi - 220 it was the only thing which was good 

2. Boba brown sugar tea - 320, it was just average 

3. Curry puffs - 320, it was way worse than street side bakery.

4. Otak otak, 550 rupees - steamed fish, just airpods case size and 2 pieces. - nothing like it is a delicacy for this exorbitant price.

5. Ayam goreng beerampah - 520 rupees - this is a deep fried chicken with sprinkles of ginger on it!! This is so mediocre and didn’t understand the hype around it in google reviews and Instagram influencers

6. SIU MAI- 380 rupees - duck meat, 3 small dumplings of duck meat, this was tasteless. 

7. Nasi lemak - 780 rupees, this was the most hyped and worst thing of all of them!! 

8. Kopi Tiramisu- 480 rupees- this is their signature dish and every one in the reviews are praising this.. astonishingly, this is just a coffee pastry served with whip cream and coffee froth.. tiramisu would come with mascarpone cheese !!

Now what went wrong???

1. Tables were of tiny kids study table size and they made 3 people to sit around it!!

2. All starters were served at same time on that table, we didn’t had any place to keep plates or cutlery..

3. It was difficult to manage anything and serving plates were like dessert plates size, we had to eat, manage.

4. Despite of calling the staff they rarely came and cleaned the tables or replaced the plates!!

5. Finally the main course came and we ran out of place on table, didn’t know where to keep it.

6. Staff didn’t even refill water!!


I paid like 4000 rupees for their disaster service and mediocre food!! 

I would have enjoyed the food, if the table space was more accommodative and staff were attentive!!

Please do not visit this restaurant for dinner!!

1nvrotq,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nvrotq/why_does_my_espresso_machine_take_so_long_to_heat/,Why does my espresso machine take so long to heat up?,"Hey coffee lovers! I've been a home barista for about 7 years now, and I recently noticed something that's been bugging me about my espresso machine. It seems to take forever to heat up in the morning, and I know many of you probably face the same issue. So, I did some deep diving to figure out what's going on.

First off, it's totally normal for an espresso machine to take anywhere from 15-45 minutes to properly heat up. I know, it sounds crazy, but there's actually a good reason for this. These machines need to reach the perfect temperature (around 200°F) to extract the best flavor from your coffee beans.

The main factor affecting heat-up time is the boiler type. Single boiler machines (like the ones I started with) generally heat up faster but can struggle with temperature consistency. Double boiler machines, while taking longer to heat up, provide much better temperature stability and are great for making multiple drinks.

I learned this the hard way - trying to rush the process usually results in bitter or sour espresso. Trust me, I've made that mistake more times than I'd like to admit!

If you're tired of waiting around in the morning, I've found some excellent machines that heat up much faster. After tons of research and testing, I discovered some great options at https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine. They've got some solid choices that won't break the bank.

Here are some tips I've learned to speed up the process:
- Keep your machine in a warm room
- Don't store it in a cold garage or basement
- Use a smart plug to turn it on before you wake up
- Regular descaling helps maintain heating efficiency
- Leave the portafilter in while heating (it needs to be hot too!)

The quality of your machine makes a huge difference too. Higher-end models usually have better heating elements and more efficient systems. If you're in the market for an upgrade, check out these reliable options at https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine - they've got everything from entry-level to pro machines.

Last month, I switched to a machine with a PID controller, which has made a massive difference in both heat-up time and temperature stability. It's like night and day compared to my old machine!

Remember, while waiting for your machine to heat up might be annoying, it's a crucial step in making great espresso. You can't rush perfection, but you can definitely make the process more efficient with the right equipment and setup.

Let me know if you have any questions about specific machines or heating issues - I'd love to help out fellow coffee enthusiasts!",1,1759371478.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False
