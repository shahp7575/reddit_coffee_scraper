Entry 2:



I woke up the next morning to Kiana nudging me, urging me to get out of bed. She motioned to the door. I got dressed and put on my shoes, being careful not to wake up her parents. We left the cabin, and were met with a cool, dewy morning. She started to walk, and I followed as she led us on a casual stroll along the lake's shore. She kept quiet for quite some time. When finally she spoke it was softly and timidly.



""I'm sorry in advance, my parents are gonna really be pushing to convert you this week. Heck, the whole camp will be. But no matter what they tell you, or how much they know about you, don't let them get under your skin, okay?""



I looked over inquiringly, but she looked back at me with a severity of sternness that silenced any questions I may have had. I'd never seen her so serious. ""You have to trust me. I know it seems overdramatic, but I need to know you're on my side.""



On her side? That's all I ever wanted to be. If I betrayed her trust, especially on something this important to her, I'd be throwing away the only thing I ever felt was worth working towards. I nodded to her reassuringly.



She cleared her throat, setting our solemn conversation to the side. ""We should get to breakfast, my parents will be waiting, and I'm sure they'll have a lot of people to introduce you to. They know everyone.""



The dining hall was warm and small, but packed with benches and tables. The place was full of joyfulness; smiling families and a few ladies with coffee and tea making rounds to tables to refill drinks. Kiana navigated the space with ease, and grabbed my hand to lead me through. We sat at a table with the Peters, where Mrs. Peters was talking with passers by, and Mr. Peters was talking it up with a younger couple, about our age. But their attention immediately turned to us as we sat down with our food. I was starving, but no one had taken a single bite, so I held off, waiting for the social cue to begin.



""Good morning Kiki, Kaleb."" Mr. Peters said with a grin. ""We were just talking with Hannah and Liam here. Turns out their family has been going here about as long as we have. Grew up in the faith, just like us!""



The young man, Liam I assume, turned to me and smiled, a kind of smile that's free of stress, free of pain. It put me on edge. His voice was just as odd. It was almost melodic or practiced. ""And are you new to the faith then my friend?"" He asked.



""No, well, sort of. I'm not really of the faith."" I responded with an awkward chuckle.



""You ain't into none of that catholic business are ya?"" he inquired, leaned forward slightly over the table, as if to get a good look at me. ""Baptist, Evangelical, Jehovah's witnesses?""



I lowered my voice, as if my words could set off a bar fight if said any louder. ""Nah. Agnostic. Never been much into religion in general. Here mostly to spend time with Ki's family.""



He seemed relatively pleased with my answer, and straightened up, preparing to speak again when a bell rung across the hall that silenced all chatter. An older gentleman in clean cut, freshly pressed attire walked out from the kitchen. ""Blessed morning, all chosen, all beloved, and all who come searching."" He announced. I swear his eyes were directly on me as he spoke the last line. ""Let us pray before we eat.""



He lifted a plate from a pedestal in the doorway. It held a flickering candle, and a type of fancy glass, some chalice or goblet. He drank of the cup, and all watched in awe. Then he looked upon the assembly and began to pray. 



""Father, Father, who art our savior, who grants peacefulness in the release of our lives unto you, who rescues us from our condemnation. Lead us to do your will. Save us from the uncertainty of the afterlife, and use us to feed thyself, for thy glory. May our sacrifice be for the betterment of all. Amen.""



He ended his prayer, and blew out the candle.",1,1738512642.0,deepnightsociety,0,1.0,False

I Love You. Similar premise, but for moving on from someone who isn't dead yet. Deals with grief.

Here it is:

7 Acts of Release: A Ritual for Reclaiming Yourself

This isn’t just about moving on—it’s about taking back your power, your story, and your future. You’re not just closing a chapter; you’re rewriting the entire book, one where they no longer have a role.

Each step is symbolic, irreversible, and absolute. This is not passive healing. This is release.

1. The Requiem (A Funeral for What Was)

When: The Moment You Decide You’re Done

They didn’t just leave—you’ve been carrying the absence they left behind. Instead of waiting for time to dull the pain, you bury it on your own terms.

Ritual:
	•	Write a eulogy for the love you gave—the real, full, genuine love that they could not hold properly.
	•	Go somewhere quiet: a park, an open road, a place that marks an ending.
	•	Read it aloud. Acknowledge that it existed, but that it is over.
	•	Burn the paper, scatter the ashes, or bury it deep. Feel the weight leave you.

From this moment, you stop treating this as an open wound. You declare it dead so you can finally begin to heal.

2. The Unbinding (Severing the Emotional Ties)

When: Immediately After The Requiem

Love leaves invisible threads—inside jokes, songs, social media, habits. These are the chains keeping them tethered to your mind. You cut them. Now.

Ritual:
	•	Gather everything tied to them: letters, screenshots, gifts, even their handwriting.
	•	Sort ruthlessly:
	•	Destroy anything sentimental (pain does not deserve souvenirs).
	•	Delete all saved conversations (even the “just in case” ones).
	•	Change small habits they influenced. New coffee spot. New playlist. New route home.
	•	Clean your digital space. Block, mute, delete. Make them an impossibility in your daily life.

You do not leave doors open. You slam them shut and weld them closed.

3. The Reckoning (Facing the Hardest Truths)

When: The First Time You Feel Weak

Heartbreak breeds endless questions: Why wasn’t I enough? Why did they move on so fast? What did I do wrong? These questions are wounds disguised as thoughts. You don’t leave them open. You answer them.

Ritual:
	•	Write two lists:
	1.	“The Truth About What They Did” (They were selfish. They used me for comfort. They made me feel replaceable.)
	2.	“The Truth About Me That They Will Never Change” (I love deeply. I deserve effort. I am strong enough to walk away.)
	•	Read them aloud, once. Then destroy the first list.
	•	Keep the second list where you can see it.

You do not seek closure from them. You give it to yourself.

4. The Great Divide (Rewriting the Mental Pathways)

When: The Next Day, and Every Day After

Memories of them are hardwired into your brain. The places you went, the music you listened to, the routines you built together. Every time you let them stay the same, you reinforce the pain. It’s time to overwrite them.

Ritual:
	•	For every memory of them, create a new one.
	•	Change your route. Your playlist. The way you start your mornings.
	•	Go to the places that were once “yours” and reclaim them alone or with someone else.
	•	Make a victory playlist. Name it something bold: “Unbreakable” / “Next Chapter” / “They Lost, I Won.”

Every change is an act of defiance. Every change is a step toward freedom.

5. The Body Reset (Purging the Pain from Your Muscles)

When: The Grief Starts Feeling Physical

You don’t just feel heartbreak in your mind—you feel it in your chest, your stomach, your hands that shake when you think of them. Your body has held them long enough. You sweat them out.

Ritual:
	•	Choose a physical activity that makes you feel powerful—boxing, running, lifting, swimming.
	•	Move daily, especially when emotions hit hard.
	•	Stand in front of the mirror after each session and say:
	•	“I am stronger than my heartbreak.”
	•	“They are no longer in my body.”

You don’t just heal emotionally—you train your body to feel alive without them.

6. The Mirror Ritual (Rebuilding the Person They Couldn’t Keep)

When: Every Morning, Until You Believe It

They let go of you. You refuse to let go of yourself.

Ritual:
	•	The Mirror Oath – Every morning, stand in front of a mirror and say:
	•	“I am not hard to love.”
	•	“I am worth more than what they gave me.”
	•	“They lost me. I did not lose them.”
	•	Watch yourself say it. Look at the person they failed to cherish.

Repeat it until it feels like the truth.

7. The Final Severance (Becoming Someone They Can No Longer Reach)

**When: The Day You Realize You No Longer Miss Them**

Healing is not about forgetting them. It’s about becoming someone they could never touch again.

Ritual:
	•	Write a letter to your future self. Describe who you are without them.
	•	List the dreams you put aside while loving them.
	•	End with one sentence: “I am free.”
	•	Seal the letter and hide it somewhere safe. Open it only when you are unshakably happy again.

When that day comes, you’ll realize: this was never about them. It was always about you.",1,1738512622.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

My partner 32m and I 34f have been together for some years. We recently moved in together. He's a morning person and I'm a night owl. We have 4 month old baby so I have to wake up early just by default which is fine. However, he wakes up with so much energy it ruins my day immediately. I literally have to pretend to sleep so he'll leave me alone. Otherwise, he's loud and tries to hug and kiss on me in the morning. A lot of times I actually am sleeping and he wakes me up trying to be cute but it's frustrating especially when the baby is sleeping and it's my only opportunity to get full sleep. Often times I have to tell him ""just stop talking!"" ""Let me wake up on my own"" or ""the baby is just feeding, she's not ready to wake up!"". Sometimes he'll comment on my body (positively but like a loud drunk would at a bar) or he'll literally narrate everything I'm doing with the baby (ie changing her or giving her a bottle), as a way to play with the baby. But it's not even the baby's wake time yet. So he wakes her up fully and leaves for work. So we both have shortened sleep. Like just stopppp talking.. enjoy a quiet morning and I would be way more happy and open to affection.

I appreciate calm mornings so much. Let me wake up on my own, grab some coffee, get the baby situated, then I'm 9/10x in a better mood. No one likes to be woken up. At night, I absolutely leave him alone because I value his sleep. I know he works everyday so I'll stay up late and do my own thing.

Please tell me how to manage. I'm trying to sort out our issues bc they seem to be growing daily. I'm not sure if it's postpartum rage or not but tracing back our rough days, I'm realizing this is usually what starts our bad ones.",1,1738512567.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

30M and 32F, with first baby due this June. Currently living in HCOL city and looking to move to MCOL suburbs 40 minutes away to be near my parents when the baby comes as my mom will be helping with childcare. We are both remote.

We are debating between going with a $500K house that we plan to live in for 2-3 years then sell/rent VERSUS buying a 900K house and making it our longer term plan. 

Net worth is approximately $1.3M (mostly in our individual brokerages, with small percentage in our 401Ks, HSA, cash). We don’t necessarily have a financial ""goal"" I did model out that if we were to put $100K savings yearly into our portfolio with a 7% average return we would be able to hit our FIRE number within 12-15 years. But that is not something we are thinking of actively, and both are currently content in our jobs.

With the $900K house the monthly cost with mortgage, taxes, insurance would be about $6K. This seems fine with our current salaries (husband is at $380K and I am at $120K). While my job seems pretty stable my husband is in tech so the worry is if he loses his job it would be hard to find an equivalent remote role so he would likely drop down to more of a $120K - $150K salary range. 

The worry with going with the $500K house is that we’ll regret it when it's time to find a bigger house and we see the prices have once again skyrocketed and the $900K houses become $1.5M and we get priced out completely.

Anyways, we are leaning towards the $900K option but wanted to poll the community to get your thoughts. Our approximate budget is below. Right now we pay $3.5K in rent, but have listed $6K to model out the $900K option.

I know that nobody can predict what will happen in the future with the housing market, but was just curious to get thoughts from the community here.

MONTHLY BUDGET

Home - $6,000  
Charity - $3,500 (don't need any comments here pls, too blessed to give anything less to those in need in our community)

Still new to all this but adding equipment slowly. I bought a bottomless portafilter for my ECP3630 and it’s been working ok but the basket is just a little too small (22mm) for 18g of coffee. I’m tamping about as hard as I can and it’s still too high in the basket. 

I’m thinking a new IMS Hugh basket would help but trying to decide between the 26mm and 30mm basket. Seems like the 30mm would give me more flexibility if I wanted to brew a larger amount at some point, but would it leave too much space at 18g? Would it be helpful to use a puck screen if I get the larger size?

So what are the negatives of too much space between the puck and the shower head? 

Thought about getting both but I’m enjoying this enough that I’ll probably end up upgrading machines within the next year and don’t want to end up with a bunch of things that won’t fit a bigger machine. ",1,1738512085.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

My boss is... well let's just say he's an extremely eccentric character. There are so many words I could use to describe him, such as inconsiderate, annoying, and just plain rude. I would love to leave my job just to get away from him, but sadly I need the insurance and I'm going to grad school at the moment, so I can't leave as there are no better prospects in the area. 

I could give you multiple examples of stuff he's done that have inconvenienced me, or annoyed me, or just made me upset, but I'll give just one. He's so disorganized and so bad at time management that he ended up booking his vacation during an extemely busy time for us with tons of late night events that week. I don't know how it got approved, but we had to pull extra hours to stay and work these events, while he got to relax at home (he claims he went to a spirtual retreat, but since he changed his story 3 times, I don't know what to believe). Before he left for vacation, I asked him to write up a guide for me on how to do something that I vaguely know how to do, but am not comfortable enough to do without guidence (think complex technology). He complained to me that he didn't have time as he was working on something else, and that I know how to do it well enough. I politely insisted that he make me the guide as the process had recently changed and I'm not familiar enough with the new process to do it by myself. He then proceeded to make me type out the guide as he dictated as ""you're so good at typing things fast"". So apparently he had the time to dictate but not type it out himself, even though he's a faster typist than I am. 

Anyways, back to the main point. I was having lunch with a friend and we were talking about a former friend of mine that my boss has heard me complain about before. This ""friend"" would often ask for favors and take advantage of my time but never do anything for me in return. I finally cut her off and the ending of the friendship was messy to say the least. She threatened to run over my dogs, she called me several slurs, some of which didn't even apply to me (she called me the n word but I am white), and then finally she threatened bodily harm against me. I was telling my other friend this as we had lunch, and I did spot my boss coming into the cafe to grab coffee (despite him supposed to be stationed at the desk as he was the only one there and I was away at lunch). I didn't really think much of it at the time, but then he started asking about her. I told him we weren't friends anymore for some serious reasons, but he kept insisting that I would be friends with her again. Which firstly, hell no, she threatened to kill my dogs! I could care less about the harm to myself, but my dogs? You do NOT mess with my dogs. 

Finally, after at least seven time of him asking about her, I snapped. The area was empty except for the security guard at the desk, and I let him have it. I reminded him that she threatend to run over my dogs (the security guard looked over at us aghast and said ""WHAT?!"" out loud), how she threatened ME, and how she used several slurs that showed her true character, and how I would never be friends with her again for one of those reasons, let alone all of them. The guard was floored and was on my side, and told my boss to drop it, but he still hasn't. Occasionally he'll bring up this person again but he's stopped doing it so often.

I guess the reason why I'm posting this here is to vent, but also to ask for advice. Should I go to HR with this? I don't want to but he just won't stop when I ask, and it's actually really bothering me. I've talked to the head of security, and he's told me he'll tell my boss to stop if I want him to, but if I need him to, he'll go to HR with me, which I really appreciate. There are two guards who have witnessed me tell him to stop, one of them has since left but I still have her contact information, so I have witnesses, but I'm still unsure. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you for letting me vent, and much love to all, especially Mark and Poppy 💚",1,1738512024.0,MarkNarrations,0,1.0,False

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Love the coffee, hate the workflow. The manual lever press is just too much work for me, especially if I've to make 2 or more double shots (for family). It's so bad at times I skip having coffee despite wanting to because I don't want to spend the time and effort. An espresso machine solves my workflow issues as I don't have to 1) heat water/ pre heat chamber 2) press the lever 3) heat milk separately 4) clean up. All the other steps that remain consistent so overall a quicker turnaround. 

I looked up this sub and 2 most common suggestions seem to be - Gaggia evo pro and Lelit Anna PID. I was leaning towards Lelit (despite over the budget) given I've no appetite for modding Gaggia or even the budget. 

But then came across HiBrew H10 plus which is a new launch, includes PID, has a pre infusion mode and some more. 

I'm not sure how does the quality of the shot compare to neo flex and if it's a worthy upgrade? 

For reference I do plan to sell neo flex and Nanofoamer to partially fund this purchase so keeping both is not an option. 

Any suggestions? All I want to ensure is it's not a step down in terms of coffee quality. ",1,1738511965.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False

1ig0ahc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPsychiatry/comments/1ig0ahc/treatment_resistant_depression_question_45f/,Treatment resistant depression question (45F),"Hello psychiatrists! I would be very grateful for your knowledge regarding my treatment resistant depression.

About me:
- 45, female
- 2 x brothers with schizophrenia, 1 x brother with depression. 
- Perimenopause (on estradiol patch 50mcg & oral progesterone 100mg)
- Dx of MDD and GAD (Lexapro since 2012, now on 40mg) 
- Dx'd with ADHD at 38 (Vyvanse 70mg, 10mg of Dexamfetamine top up)
- started Lamotrigine 100mg about 4 months ago to augment Lexapro.

I started getting low mood around the time I started ADHD meds (38). Because of my age at the time, I wondered if the low mood was due to perimenopause, so I started HRT. 

Even though I like Vyvanse, I do wonder if it might be my sensitive brain reacting to it due to my genetic make up (see above about brothers). 

I've tried different meds to augment the Lexapro including Brintillex (didn't work), and other stuff I can't remember. 

I am a resilient woman: I'm a single mother, I've been through a lot of shit from childhood (again, see above re brothers) and I have been through heaps of therapy. 
I am now an early career mental health OT and I bought a house! (Yay!). 

Despite this, I am feeling sadness/mood lability every day. 
It seems to be better for an hour or  three, when my Vyvanse is in my system, but when it wears off, I am just gritting my teeth and drinking coffee to get through feeling like shit.
I recently did a medication DNA test which I will discuss with my psychiatrist soon, as he has the results. This might help provide insight into why I'm still getting depression despite being on all the meds. 

Did I break my brain from long term, high dose Lexapro, as well as  taking Vyvanse with a high genetic loading for mental illness? 

Yikes 😬

Buy Canadian when you can but the UK, France, Germany, Japan, South Korea, and others, have great substitutes.","Clothing? Our outdoor clothing brands are even better. Arc'teryx instead of Patagonia for technical outdoor wear. Lululemon, Aritzia, and Reigning Champ for nicer brands. For basics sub out GAP and Old Navy for H&M or Uniqlo, or other Canadian brands. Avoid Nike. Adidas is German.

Food? Avoid Mcdonalds, starbucks, Chipotle. We have A&W, local coffee shops (which are usually cheaper btw), Burrito Boyz in the GTA. Pizza Hut has been downhill for decades but there's plenty of local stores.

American cars? Firstly, Japanese cars have been the best in the world for decades, American cars are notoriously shit, and Toyota and Honda build a lot of models in Ontario. The RAV4, Corolla, and CRV are built in Ontario. BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen have some cars built in Germany if you must. Kia and Hyundai are great nowadays and more reliable than most American brands while being more affordable than Toyota and Honda.

Warm vacation? Honestly, skip Florida. It's cheap to fly there but even before this it was more expensive than going elsewhere once you factor in stays and taxis and food. And the quality of your vacation will be much better. Mexico could use our support. If you want to go to Disney, think about Japan or France. Portugal and Spain are great destinations for the climate. Japan in particular is one of the most attractive places to visit given their currency is weak now as well.

Shoppers is Canadian for beauty products. For the love of good use your PC points well because it's expensive but it's even cheaper than Sephora (french company) for beauty products when you use points well.

Circle K, Petro Canada, Canadian Tire Gas, all Canadian.

Walmart and Amazon have been destroying small businesses for years and people have been screaming to shop local. Go to your local supplement / health food store and stock up. Amazon is a ripoff for most niche things around the $20 price point anyways. You can probably find the same thing at Dollarama for $5. Most products you can find made by Unilever instead of P&G.

Food Basics, Metro, No Frills, Loblaws, Farm Boy, Sobeys, all Canadian. Your local ethnic grocery store is probably owned by someone in the community. Dollarama instead of Dollar Tree.

Netflix keeps raising prices, use Crave, try Britbox, watch some Korean dramas, explore Bollywood movies, if you're in the GTA they have Indian movies playing in Cineplex theatres. Watch Japanese classic films.

Buy Ontario or BC wine, Alberta and Manitoba whisky.

Now the harder stuff to substitute is Apple, Microsoft, and Google. That we (and the world) needs to work on.",7,1738511836.0,BuyCanadian,1,1.0,False
1ig09ni,https://www.reddit.com/r/LPR/comments/1ig09ni/8_weeks_after_starting_my_plan/,8 weeks after starting my plan,"Background:  5+ years (probably 10 years of issues).  Symptoms, in order of appearance:  Cough, Slight Sinus Congestion, chest congestion (treated with Amoxicillin at least 5x over the years), heart palpitations, severe sore throat and Laryngitis at least 5x, then severe sinus congestion(requiring amoxicillin), tooth decay (in waves, mostly molars), Severe TMJ, chest pains, sore lymph nodes, and finally shortness of breath.  Could not sleep for more than 4 hours.

Tried to treat symptoms:  nasal rinse, cough medication, mucinex, Omnaris, tons of OTC cold medications, lots of Ibuprofen, Acetaminophen, facial massage for TMJ, and more and more nasal rinses.  Tried Gluten free, tried low fat, tried dropping one thing every few days, but nothing helped.  PPI did nothing but give me wicked headaches.

Solution:  Eight weeks ago, while searching the net I ran across LPR.  I had all the symptoms - but not any ENT (saw several), my family doctor or any doctor at emergency, or even any dentist, knew or told me what it was.  I then discovered Dr Jamie Koufman, and researched her theory on what is happening - trade several of her peer reviewed published articles, and decided to follow this regime (takes between 3 - 12 weeks to show results.). To test if I had LPR, I waited for the chest pains to start and drank a large cup of alkaline water - there was INSTANT relief.  

Why is there relief with alkaline water?

Your stomach releases pepsin, which, in layman’s terms, allows the stomach to digest meat.  Pepsin only digests meat when in an acidic environment - your stomach.  A small amount of pepsin gets into your esophagus, usually due to your LES (lower esophageal sphincter).  Your esophagus can handle a little pepsin - it’s made for that.   The issue is the UES (upper esophageal sphincter) is your last barrier to your throat, larynx and sinus.  When pepsin breaches the UES, and is hit by any acid, it starts digesting - the tissue it’s in contact with.  This causes inflammation, which in turn causes the UES to get inflamed, and it cannot seal properly then, allowing more pepsin out - a vicious circle!  Now alkaline environments kill pepsin dead - turns it off so to speak.  Drink alkaline water, kill pepsin.  

However that does not solve the problem of the inflamed UES.  It does however, make you feel much much better.

The next goal is to stop all acid from reaching any pepsin - hence the diet as prescribed by Dr Koufman (it’s all online for free - just search)

Here is my plan Inbuilt for myself and it worked very very well.

1) Drink nothing but alkaline water with PH level of 9.5 or higher OR camomile tea.

2) Sleep with bed on incline (raise headboard 8 inches - do not use pillows because you will invariably push them away and sleep flat again - that’s bad). I am now down to 4 inches…….no more sliding down the bed.

3). Use an alginate - I use Reflux Gourmet, but also available is UK version of Gaviscon, Reflux Raft etc.  I carried the gum with me from Reflux Gourmet, and had travel pouches wherever I went.  5ml dosage, after every meal, double dosage before bed.  (Did this for 4 weeks and then weaned myself off to just before bed)

4) Famotidine 20mg - one BEFORE every meal (not during, not after), and 2x before bed.  Did that for 4 weeks and started weaning and now only take 40 mg at night before bed.

5) Flush sinus with Neilmed salt and Alkaline water - heated up slightly.  This kills any pepsin in nasal passages and really, really made my sinus issues go away.

6) diet - nothing acidic - followed Dr Koufmans diet - basically sourdough bread,  oatmeal, lean chicken/pork, rice, pasta, melons (tons of melons), avocado, fish, and tons of veggies all cooked at home.  Low low fat.

So after 8 weeks where am I:

Been 5 weeks since any breathless episodes.  

Added coffee (once a day) on week 4, and added more olive oil and some fattier foods as well.

Had a margarita (!!!!!!) last week, with slight episode next day, just felt it coming on so took reflux gourmet and all was fine.

Drank Red wine 3x and only one time had too much and felt it next day.

Started adding more food to diet and stated eating out.

Things I am now taking:
40 Mg of Famotidine before bed
Reflux Gourmet before bed
Nasal rinse as required (been 5 days and not needed)

I am well on my way to a full recovery - and hope in the next few weeks to be fully healed.  I will always watch my diet, and will continue to drink alkaline water.  Hope this helps someone - LPR is nasty and will only go away with intervention.  (Now my tooth issues need major attention and dollars - sigh)

I brewed a decaf [bean](https://www.coffeecircle.com/en/k/decaf-entkoffeiniert) roasted for filter (a month from roast date) on a V60, 20g. Brew ratio of 1:15 and I set the temperature to 89 degrees as this was suggested for decaf. It always took longer than I thought it should. Meanwhile I am at the coarsest grind setting (18) on my Timermore Sculptor 78S (standard burrs) and it still takes 4m30s (from beginning of bloom to the grounds almost running dry).  

I pour 5 times, first time 30s for bloom, the rest after I see that the grounds barely become dry, the early pours are quicker than 30s, the latter slower. All pours are 60g.

Can't complain about the taste. In fact when I was at a finer grind setting it felt a bit sweeter (but I am also a noob, so never mind that). But still 4m30s is way above something like 2m. 

What do you think. Is around 2m a helpful target duration? Should I try another grinder (I bought a 1zpresso k-ultra, but haven't used it yet and would prefer not to introduce more variables at this time).

Should I agitate more? It doesn't feel like it does much. I did vary pouring height and I sometimes used a spoon during one(!) of the latter pours to deeply stir up the grounds. 

I have roughly similar outcomes with other coffee beans as well, but to be specific I wrote about a the brew from today. It was decaf, but other ones, [example](https://thebarn.de/products/nano-challa), were also slow, even when at the coarsest grind.",2,1738511332.0,pourover,5,1.0,False

The focus on action not fear gave me the impetus to take the first step and just get started.

The concept of focusing  on “deepening (or in my case, starting) my pantry” as opposed to “prepping” was what gave me the incentive to get started, the right intention is so important.

So i picked 4 things to focus on with starting my pantry: foods affected by deportation, tariffs, and bird flu and my mental health and attitude.

My freezer was delivered Thursday and after my Costco trip yesterday it is now crowded with avocado, fresh fruit and kale for my smoothies and frozen veggies and chicken thighs.

Instead, I preferred staying in local and poorer areas, where I could experience the true essence of the country.

The pictures I have are from Google, but they resemble the best places I visited. I don’t remember the exact name of the area, but I know it was an Islamic district. It reminded me of Venice, Italy, with its stunning architecture. These types of buildings are truly mesmerizing, especially at night during winter—they create such a peaceful and relaxing atmosphere.

I plan to visit again soon, once the area becomes safe. What I truly love about Egypt is how welcoming the people are. From the very first encounter, they treated me like a local. They invited me to have hot coffee and chocolate, warmly insisting, *“Come, come, you are my brother! I swear you won’t have to pay anything. It’s on me—eat, drink!”*

At first, I thought Egypt wouldn’t be for me. I had previously visited Saudi Arabia, and it didn’t feel like an authentic Arabian country to me. It was a mix of foreign influences, and overall, I didn’t find it to be a great place. However, Egypt proved to be a completely different experience—one that I deeply cherish.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day, but right now I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC 😅 I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play any TTRPGs, but would love to.

I suffer from a bit of learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

1ig00m3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ig00m3/the_smiths_family_case_part_1/,The Smiths Family Case [part 1],"
My name is Joshua Carter. I'm a 42-year-old detective, and for the past sixteen years, I have seen things—things that would make any sane man question reality. Murder scenes, abuse cases, disappearances. I thought I'd seen it all.

I was wrong.

My wife, Sarah, says I haven’t been the same since the Smith family case. She tells me I barely sleep, that I stare off into nothing for hours, lost in my thoughts. She suggested I see a psychiatrist—Dr. Maggie Lane.

So, here I am.

The drive to Maggie’s place takes an hour, winding up the mountain roads. Her house looms at the peak, a massive marble structure overlooking the entire town. It’s an eerie place, too quiet, too isolated.

When I step inside, Maggie greets me. She’s young, maybe late twenties, but carries herself with the weight of someone much older. Her blindness doesn’t seem to hinder her—she moves with ease, as if she can see things I can’t. She and my wife met at a coffee shop years ago, and Sarah trusts her.

Maggie leads me into her spacious living room. Floor-to-ceiling windows reveal the whole town below, the lights flickering like dying stars. I sit down on the couch, hands clasped. She asks why I’m here.

“Police work. Stress. Lack of sleep,” I lie.

She doesn’t buy it.

“Joshua,” she says, her voice soft but firm. “Tell me the real reason. The Smith family case.”

A chill runs down my spine. “You’ve heard of it?”

“Everyone in this town has,” she says.

Of course, they have. It was the kind of case that crawled under your skin and nested there.

I exhale. “I’ve never seen anything like it before. It’s been a month, and I still can’t make sense of it.”

Maggie leans forward slightly. “Start from the beginning.”

I do.

A month ago, a frantic woman called 911. She didn’t give her name, just an address—Smith residence. “Hurry,” she said, her voice breaking. “Something’s wrong.” Then the line went dead.

When we arrived, the house was dark. No one answered the door. We forced our way in. And what we found…

Mr. and Mrs. Smith were on the floor, lifeless, their blood pooling around them. Their son, Jake, sat nearby, silent, staring into nothing, holding a bloody knife. And their daughter, Emily… she was laughing.

Not crying. Not screaming. Laughing.

Uncontrollably.

I pause, my throat dry. Maggie listens, unmoving.

The doorbell rings.

Maggie stands, feeling her way to the door. A deliveryman hands her a package, a plain cardboard box. She leaves it by the door and returns.

“Go on,” she says.

I clear my throat. “We called an ambulance, but Mr. and Mrs. Smith were already dead. The kids were taken into custody. But none of it made sense. Did the children kill their parents? If not, who did? And who was the woman who called 911?”

Maggie interrupts. “You said four family members. But the Smiths were a family of five.”

My stomach twists.

“Yes… Their eldest daughter left home two years ago. She cut off all contact. No one knows what happened to her.”

I shake my head. “Journalists ran wild with the story, but even we, the police, had more questions than answers.”

Maggie tilts her head slightly. “And what happened to Jake and Emily?”

I swallow hard. “Jake never spoke. Not once. Not a single word since we found him. And Emily… she just kept laughing.”

Maggie is quiet for a long moment. “And you don’t believe they did it.”

I meet her unseeing eyes.

“No. I don’t.”

Because deep down, I know—this wasn’t just a murder. It was something much, much worse.

And I’m still trapped inside it .

I shift uncomfortably on the couch, my fingers tapping against my knee.

“There were too many unanswered questions,” I continue. “The kids—if they did it, why? If they didn’t, who else was in that house? And then there’s the 911 call.”

Maggie leans forward slightly. “The woman who called?”

I nod. “That’s the biggest mystery. She never gave her name. Her voice sounded desperate, terrified. She knew something was happening before we even got there. But after that call… she vanished.”

“No trace?” Maggie asks.

“Nothing,” I say. “No fingerprints, no witnesses. We checked phone records—the number was unregistered. It wasn’t a burner, though. It was just… like it never existed.”

Maggie’s lips press together. “And what do you think happened to her?”

I exhale sharply, running a hand through my hair. “I don’t know. Maybe she was part of it. Maybe she was just someone who stumbled onto something she shouldn’t have.”

“Or maybe,” Maggie says, “she never existed at all.”

A chill creeps up my spine.

I glance at the package still sitting by the door. Something about it unsettles me now. I shake off the feeling and refocus.

“All I know is… I haven’t slept since that night,” I say. “And every time I close my eyes, I hear Emily laughing.”

Maggie tilts her head. “And Jake?”

I hesitate.

“That’s the strangest part,” I admit. “Jake was silent. Completely, unnervingly silent. But there was something in his eyes.”

“What?”

I lick my lips, suddenly feeling parched.

“Recognition.”

Maggie doesn’t speak for a long time. Then, finally, she says,

“Joshua… you need to ask yourself something.

If the woman who called 911 was never found…

Are you sure she wasn’t already inside the house when you arrived?”

I feel the blood drain from my face.

Because I don’t know.

And that terrifies me.

I started dating this girl 2 month ago, it were the most beautiful months of my life. However.. things were complicated..

We had a small argument around one week ago because she found out from one of my ex friends that I didn't like her that much when we first started dating. Then the next day we had another argument because I told her that I went to the coffee shop with a classmate, thinking I was with another girl.

This Friday we were dating again and talking about us. She told me that sometimes I am too immature and thats what she is currently not looking for. She also said that she is afraid that I will start liking another girl in the future and I will dump her. Then I also told her my worries, that I am going to uni soon and I don't know if I can be with her. She tried to help saying that we can see what we do until then, and that I should not worry about the future. She also tells me that she wants me to be more touchy with her, because she hates that I dont hug her, initiate, etc.  
After that, she tells me to close my eyes and we kiss. After the first, we kiss once again after a few seconds. It was beautiful.

Today she friendzones me. Asking her what I did wrong, she said that it's not my fault, which I dont really believe. Her period is in 4 days, could this be because of PMS? I know I shouldn't blame it on pms, however she told me that when we had a similar experience last month when she ghosted me for 5 days straight and after that she started texting me back to normal and blaming me if I wouldn't respond to her messages in under 3 minutes.

I really love her. The moment I saw her I knew that she was going to be the special person. I don't know why or how but I was always just feeling a special connection between me and her.",0,1738511139.0,lawofattraction,0,0.5,False

i just bought the hario v60 drip assist and i noticed that the water does not flow through the coffee right away and it looks like it just sits on the top.

The grind size was the same like when i pour with my kettle and with my kettle i never noticed this.

The end result looks much more even compared to when i pour with my kettle. Is this a good sign and should it also be more even when i pour with my kettle?

I’d say we got really close during that. One time she had a bad mental reaction to her pain meds where she called me to help with her anxiety… so I thought I was becoming someone important to her. 

This Friday was the first time we met after a week of talking. It started off with a coffee date then she came back over to my house after while she waited to go to her class that night. We spent 5 hours talking and cuddled the last hour. It was a great time for me honestly. 

The problem was after the date. I texted her a couple hours later saying I had a good time and hope she got home safe! She did not respond until like 4 hours later and said she did too. 

At this point I thought everything was great. But then she started talking to me less. After I asked for the 2nd date she said yes what you thinking. I told her we could grab dinner. That was yesterday. She hasn’t responded since. I’m so confused what went wrong? She told me she had a mental breakdown to her therapist the day before we met so I know she is going through something’s. Just sucks to feel ghosted by someone you got close with in a short amount of time. I was insanely respectful during the date. Didn’t try anything weird. She was laughing the whole time. What do you think Reddit? The only thing I can think off is that at one point she took off my hat. I was thinning before but I started fin+ mix and it’s recovered but that was the only weird part when she randomly yanked my hat off. This has hurt my confidence a little.

Can someone older here advise me?,"I have posted this on the askwomen sub too, but they misunderstood me. Like they are thinking I'm forcing this guy or being creepy to him which is not true smh. I'm not even in contact with him since several weeks. I just wanted to know your opinion on this.

I'm 25 now. I have always been very good in career but was held back because I was extremely overweight when younger. I didnt care about my grooming at all. When I first moved to a new city for work at 23, I was fat- like, VERY fat (80kg at 5'6"") it was something that put me in the invisible, below-average bucket. I had little to no friends and OBVIOUSLY didnt get approached.

I still had some social groups, and one of the guys (2 years older than me) used to flirt with me. We used to hangout (as a group). We were very touchy with each other. But we lost contact for a year as he suddenly vanished. Like, nobody knew where he went. He was in a relationship for some time is all I know. He re-appeared when I was 25 and he 27.

I lost a lot of baby fat and became skinny by the time I was 24.5 years old. Some of it went away as it was baby fat, while I also got really INTO fitness (running especially). I'm really into gymming now, and it takes up at least 2 hours of my day. I'm now at 58kg, which makes me look good. Like, complete transformation. I also changed the way I dressed (earlier it was always jeans and a top, but now it's sometimes ethnic wear, jumpsuits, long dresses, clinched waist tops etc.). EVERYTHING has changed socially. Like, people actually come to me (not invisible anymore), and yes I get approached by men now - be it at work, in the gym, running club, old male friends from school/ university, etc.

But this guy is not the same with me anymore. Like, all the flirting and teasing is still there when we meet, but he mostly avoids me. Like, he's single for sure, but he will mostly not come for hangouts or not reply to my messages. He is more serious, unlike how he was when I was fat. We aren't even like friends now, as there's this ""discomfort"" from his side.

What's up with him? i am having such a difficult time because I cant let go of him. I really adore him because he used to be with me when mostly everyone else ignored me (i couldnt even speak in a good/ polished way when I first met him). Unfortunately, I dont find any other guy attractive even if they may be more handsome or fit or something, this particular guy is my only one.

\> When he came back to town after 2 years, he had texted me first ""hey, I'm back in the city"". But then he himself started ghosting me. It was basically a pattern of ghosting and then re-starting the conversation.  But now, he doesnt reply and leaves me on read. So I have stopped.

\> when I re-texted to meet for a coffee when he's free, and he didnt respond to it. So, i cannot force him again because it will be creepy.

\> Coincidentally, I did see him briefly face-to-face at a common friend's party, where i raised this to him. He jokingly said ""maybe you should take the hint"", followed by a hug. Ever since this day, I am not in touch with him. That day, he also discussed that he had a really bad breakup recently.

We all dream of exploring iconic destinations like Stonehenge, the Pyramids, or the Grand Canyon, but the real magic often lies beyond the well-trodden paths. Imagine uncovering breathtaking landscapes, indulging in once-in-a-lifetime adventures, or wandering to remote corners of the world that most travellers never reach. Road trips offer the ultimate freedom to chart your own course, giving you the flexibility to discover hidden gems that public transportation can’t access.

An [international road trip](https://www.e-itca.org/post/bestroadtripsintheworld) isn’t just about getting from point A to point B — it’s about embracing the journey, where every mile is a story waiting to unfold. With an International Driving Permit (IDP) in hand, you have the freedom to explore at your own pace, diving into local cultures, scenic routes, and tucked-away treasures.

Here, we highlight some of the world’s most enchanting destinations, best experienced with a rental car and your spirit of adventure. So, pack your bags, grab your IDP, and let’s hit the open road to create unforgettable memories!

# 1. The Quiraing, Isle of Skye, Scotland

The Quiraing hike is one of the most unique and stunning places on earth. Great for photography, especially at sunrise. Tucked away in the remote Scottish Highlands, the Quiraing on the Isle of Skye is a breathtaking landscape of jagged peaks, rolling hills, and mysterious rock formations. This stunning location is perfect for road trippers who want to escape the bustling cities and immerse themselves in nature.

Why You Need a Car: Public transport is scarce on the Isle of Skye, making a rental car essential. With your IDP, you can confidently navigate the winding single-track roads that lead to panoramic viewpoints and hidden hiking trails.

Don’t Miss:

* The Old Man of Storr for surreal views.
* Fairy Pools for a magical dip in crystal-clear waters.

# 2. The Peloponnese Peninsula, Greece

While most tourists flock to Athens, Santorini, or Mykonos, the Peloponnese Peninsula remains a hidden treasure brimming with ancient ruins, charming villages, and pristine beaches. The beaches of the Peloponnese are on another level! Crystalline waters are surrounded by peculiar landscapes that are still unspoiled by mass tourism. Places that are so beautiful that it is hard to believe they are even real!

Why You Need a Car: The Peloponnese is best explored by car as public transport does not connect the region’s scattered historical sites effectively. With an IDP, you can cruise along coastal roads and venture into the rugged mountains.

Don’t Miss:

* Ancient Messene, an underrated archaeological site.
* Voidokilia Beach, a horseshoe-shaped haven.
* Dimitsana, a quaint village ideal for nature lovers.

# 3. Salento, Colombia

Nestled in Colombia’s coffee region, Salento is a picturesque town surrounded by verdant valleys and towering wax palm trees. It’s a paradise for those seeking tranquility and authenticity. If you want to visit Cocora Valley or experience the Colombian coffee region, then Salento is worth visiting

Why You Need a Car: While the town itself is walkable, exploring the surrounding Cocora Valley and nearby coffee farms is much easier with a car. Your IDP will enable you to rent a vehicle and navigate the winding rural roads.

Don’t Miss:

* Valle de Cocora for breathtaking hikes.
* Coffee farm tours to learn about the coffee-making process.
* A scenic drive to Filandia, another charming town.

# 4. The Algarve, Portugal

The Algarve is renowned for its golden beaches, hidden sea caves, and charming fishing villages. However, many of its best spots are far from touristy hubs. Widely regarded as some of the most breathtaking coastal areas in the world, the Algarve presents 155 kilometres of unspoiled south-facing beaches. There are 150 named beaches in the Algarve, meaning that whichever luxury Pousadas in the Algarve you select, you are never too far away from a whole host of choices.

Why You Need a Car: With an IDP, you can rent a car and explore secluded beaches and cliffs that are otherwise difficult to access. Public transportation in this region is limited and doesn’t cover off-the-beaten-path locations.

Don’t Miss:

* Benagil Cave, accessible by kayak or boat.
* Praia da Marinha, often voted one of the world’s best beaches.
* Monchique, a peaceful mountain town.

# 5. Route des Grandes Alpes, France

For road trip enthusiasts, the Route des Grandes Alpes is a dream come true. Over 700 km, 17 mountain passes and 3 national nature parks, the Route des Grandes Alpes sets the scene for one of the most awe-inspiring journeys to quench your thirst for adventure! It’s jam-packed with winding roads and stunning scenery from Lake Geneva to the Mediterranean.This high-altitude drive offers jaw-dropping scenery, charming alpine villages, and plenty of opportunities for outdoor activities.

Why You Need a Car: This iconic route is best navigated with a rental car and an IDP. It’s the only way to truly experience the freedom of stopping wherever you want to admire the views or take a detour to explore hidden villages.

Don’t Miss:

* Lake Annecy for its turquoise waters.
* Col de l’Iseran, the highest paved mountain pass in Europe.
* Mont Blanc, Europe’s highest peak.

# 6. Western Australia

While the eastern coast of Australia often steals the spotlight, Western Australia offers equally stunning landscapes with far fewer crowds. Here, you’ll find unique rock formations that seem almost magical, ancient Aboriginal sites rich with history, lush green vineyards producing some of the world’s best wine, and crystal-clear ocean waters that feel like paradise. Western Australia is a place where every corner has something special waiting for you to explore - from rugged coastlines to serene deserts, this region is a road tripper’s paradise.

Why You Need a Car: Western Australia is vast, and public transport is virtually non-existent in many areas. With an IDP, you can rent a car and explore at your own pace.

Don’t Miss:

* Ningaloo Reef for snorkeling with whale sharks.
* The Pinnacles Desert for its otherworldly limestone formations.
* Margaret River for world-class wine and food.

# 7. Andalusia’s White Villages, Spain

Andalusia in southern Spain is dotted with picturesque whitewashed villages nestled in the hills. These charming towns are rich in history, culture, and stunning views. As you travel in this area you’ll find villages in gorgeous natural settings, where you can take photos of the whitewashed houses hung about with pots of colourful flowers, gaze at the mountain landscapes, discover the traces of the Islamic and Christian past, and really, truly relax.

Taking a driving tour to admire these picturesque little towns appear among the mountains like a mirage is an enchanting experience.

Why You Need a Car: Public transport in this region is sparse, and the villages are best explored on your own schedule. An IDP will allow you to rent a car and discover these hidden gems comfortably.

Don’t Miss:

* Ronda for its dramatic cliffside setting.
* Setenil de las Bodegas, where homes are built into rock overhangs.

# Why an International Driving Permit is Your Key to These Road Trips

An International Driving Permit is more than just a document; it’s your gateway to freedom and exploration. Here’s why you should always have one when planning an international road trip:

1. **Legal Requirement:** Many [countries](https://www.e-itca.org/international-driving-permit-countries) mandate an IDP for foreign drivers. Without one, you risk fines or being unable to rent a car.
2. **Universal Understanding:** The IDP translates your local license into multiple languages, ensuring that authorities and rental agencies can easily understand it.
3. **Hassle-Free Car Rentals:** Most car rental companies abroad require an IDP to complete the rental process.
4. **Peace of Mind:** Knowing you have all the [necessary documentation](https://www.e-itca.org/) lets you focus on enjoying your trip.

**Conclusion**

Driving internationally opens up a world of opportunities to explore hidden gems that most travellers never see. With an International Driving Permit from ITCA, you can confidently embark on road trips to remote landscapes, charming villages, and breathtaking natural wonders. So, what are you waiting for? Start planning your next adventure today and make memories that will last a lifetime!

1ifziug,https://publicpolicy.pepperdine.edu/blog/posts/what-did-fdr-mean-by-a-living-wage.htm,"Why is it that most Older gens view us newer gens struggling with the housing crisis, a ""work harder, get educated"" issue? minimum wage in PA is hurting all of us and I'll break down why.","I had made a post yesterday simply reaching out and asking newer gens for advice on how they were able to comfortably move out and what tips can they share. 

The response was not pleasant, there were older gens saying that we new gens spend on bull shit, hence is why we are too broke to afford renting an apartment. Others said to get educated and a better job. A select few even put their head in the sand and said that housing crisis is a component, but you just have to work it out with roommates, minimum wage has nothing to do with it. 

Our govenor, and PA leaders, on two separate occasions. Sent a request to senate in hopes to raise the minimum wage, which hasn't budged in 30 years, both times the case file would go through one hoop and then grow cold. The second request, is currently in Law and Labor.

The minimum wage, when created and stated back by the FDR was supposed to be created to support families. [Link posted above] PA is not only behind, but is basically giving wages supposed to be for teenagers to full grown adults with or without a college education.

I said in my post yesterday that the minimum wage is overdue, and that the minimum to afford a 1400 bedroom apartment alone, is 23 an hour. 

Comments flung back saying ""what jobs are even paying you 7.50 an hour? Get a better job.""  ""What jobs are you seeing that pay less than 16 an hour?""

Retail jobs, start at 12 to 14 an hour, Fast Food workers and coffee baristas start at 15, and working for daycares or with preschool students, even few teacher positions START at 16 or 21 an hour but can vary due to education level. 

Lastly, when you go out to your favorite restaurant, servers and bartenders are paid BELOW minimum wage, around 2 to 3.50 an hour. There are many jobs that don't even come close to afford a 1400 a month bedroom. 

If everyone was told to ""Find a better job."" There wouldn't be retail workers, cashiers, fast food workers, bartenders or servers, or even daycare or camp counselors or lower education teachers. That's millions of positions abandoned. 

And for the ones who are being paid 23 and above, worked for a sturdy education through college and work a job. They deserve to be paid more. Why are doctors or nurses and higher educated teachers being paid 24-30+ dollars? That means they can afford a slightly nicer apartment according to our current housing economy. But don't even try to go for a house. You'll need a home that's around 150k-200k to comfortably afford it due to the 30% income rule to properly save money for emergencies and retirement.

Now you can always break the 30% rule and then things start to change. But my previous was met with so many mixed opinions that I'm genuinely curious why older gens don't believe that newer gens are struggling? 

This probably will get a little cross like yesterday's post. But this is what happens when living in a purple ish/red state both sides have opinions.",8,1738509824.0,lehighvalley,15,0.7,False

I had an appointment with a doctor and she preformed an exam and didn't feel any lumps either and described what she was feeling as ""fibrous tissue.""

The tech didn't see anything on the ultrasound and neither did the radiologist. I have a follow up with my primary doctor tomorrow but I'm so upset I didn't get a single answer. The ultrasound tech said the pain could be caused by 1) an ill fitting bra- I only have been wearing t shirt bras for the past year or so but I don't think it's them causing it. 2) too much caffeine- I only drink about 1-2 cups of coffee a week IF that and none of the soda I drink is caffeinated. 3) a pulled muscle.

1ifzayn,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1ifzayn/am_i_exaggerating/,Am I exaggerating?,"AITA for despising my parents for no reason?

I (F22) despise my parents and constantly think they’re lame to the point I get nervous and can’t talk to them for a few hours sometimes.

My parents are good people, they both work and have quite normal personalities, they just have 0 aspirations, hobbies, culture, knowledge or whatever. They only work and come home and watch tv and do nothing. They’re always so shocked and negative when I bring up the fact that I go to the gym or read books or go volunteer to an animal shelter, like “where do you find the time???? Just stay home, why would you get tired??? Just rest”.

I’m in med school, and last summer when school ended I worked (not much I did basically nothing at work) so I could have some money, they even complained about this because they wanted me to stay home and do nothing and “sleep”. A 21 yrs old girl, single, with no job, no nothing, no exams, for them it was the best for me to just stay home and stare the wall for hours or watch films and tv shows 10 hours a day. I did it for 3 years straight, staying home every summer (I have no friends in my home town) watching films and tv shows for 15 hour straight and for them it was so normal they never even realized I was depressed and contemplating suicide all that time.

Everytime I bring up a hobby or something I like (like this summer I would like to learn how to surf) they always bring up university and exams like it’s supposed to be my whole fucking life. They end up saying “yes but what about the exams?” AM I ALLOWED TO HAVE A PERSONALITY OUTSIDE BEING A DOCTOR PLEASE? Every time someone their age says “My son did this” “My daughter does this” they bring up me and my sister doing “difficult” degrees/career paths. Like they fucking have nothing to say about us outside that because they don’t have anything in their life outside their lame job so they’re not CAPABLE of appreciation of everything else.

Everytime I’m at their house (like now, I’m here for the weekend) I get nervous because if they have the day off they just wake up, do breakfast, watch tv and play games on their phones, eat lunch, watch a film, eat dinner, watch a film. End of the day. I’m in my room and everytime I go out they’re in the same position brain rotting.

I have to add we’re not rich but we have the money to do other stuff like we could go hiking, biking, go take a coffee on the beach, go to the CINEMA, READ a book, see some family friends, they could go to evening adult school since they never studied past middle school, or go to the gym, go for a run, do some of those old people courses like cooking stuff, since we live in an archeological area they could do some visits with some guides, or go to local festivals, knitting, gardening.

When I go to the shelter I see people their age doing the same stuff I’m doing, when I go to university I see people their age, when I go hiking/caving I see people their age, when I go running I see people their age, when I go to the gym I see people their age, when I go to the library I see people their age, and EVERYTIME I’m with people MY age. They’re the only old people who do nothing outside of work (they have desk jobs so they can’t even say they’re tired) and they try to force me to be the only young one to do nothing too.

I’m at the point where I started hating them for being so boring, I know I have literally no reason to feel nervous or angry about their life since it’s THEIR life not mine so I shouldn’t care about anything but their love for me and our relationship…but I feel like I’m forced to be friend to someone who doesn’t understand me at all and tries to convince me to have their lame life, if they were FRIENDS not family I would’ve stopped contact but I have to fake tolerating this until I die so I’m becoming insufferable.

I have other problems going on in my life so I might be projecting my problems on this situation, but at the same time I feel like my feelings are valid since we all agree if we had the possibility to CHOOSE some people to spend the rest of our lives talking to the choice wouldn’t be people so different from us. So idk if people feel like this all the time or they just feel a little bit sad and I’m just an asshole for feeling this angry.

This is detailing a trip I took back in June and July 2023, I know it's a huge delay, but his post took me a hell of a while to write. 

**Section One: Bio**

**Age**: 29 

**Occupation**: as of this trip, I was a full-time library worker in an academic library.

**Hometown**: DC metro area.

**Number of PTO days and how you accrue them**:  (then) 4 hours per pay period.  Through the power of Juneteenth and July 4, I was able to take most of the trip as PTO and only 2 days as unpaid leave.

**Section Two: Assets + Debt (all are joint with my husband, Sebastian and current as of Jan 2025, not the trip, sorry)**:

* Retirement Balance: ~$190k

* Equity if you're a homeowner: We jointly own property with our family.  We own a 1/3 share of a $1,400,000 home.

* Savings account balance: ~$19k

* Checking account balance: ~$9k

* Brokerage account balance: ~$3k

* Mortgage: our 1/3 share of $934,000.37 remaining, ~$311k.  We also owe my mom $29,095 as she paid the entirety of the down payment and we have been paying her back.

* Student loan debt: around 7k for a masters in library science.

* Husband's income: (then) ~130k with a 10k bonus

* My income: (then) 31k

**Side Gig Monthly Take Home**: Variable.  I read for trivia competitions for elementary, middle and high school students.  I read whenever competitions are being run and when I'm available.  Competitions are both online and in-person.  I am a very experienced reader and am also taking on roles as assistant tournament director which earns me a higher rate.  I earn $15 per match read and $200 ish for assistant tournament direction.  I saved all my earnings for a year (around 2k) to help pay for (read: justify splurging) on this trip.

**Any Other Monthly Income Here**: I receive $2000 from a family trust.


**Section Four: Travel Expenses**

* BEFORE THE TRIP

* Flights: $1223.75 and 116,628 Chase Sapphire rewards points

**TUE June 18**

7:50pm – Arrive in Dulles.  Sebastian gets hungry and has a Cava bowl ($14.20).

10:50pm – Our flight leaves.  I watch In The Heights and ended up sobbing.  I watch half of Turning Red (note: I never finished it and still don't know how it ends).

3:15pm – Arrive at our layover in Germany – I get a little sandwich and pastry ($13.89) - and board our plane to Helsinki.

7pm – Taxi to our hotel ($41.98).  We are exhausted but need to eat so we eat at a Nepalese restaurant a block away ($60.17)

**THU June 20**

9am – Wake up and have the included hotel breakfast.  It's a huge continental spread.  Sebastian has been dealing with a bulging disc and is very dutiful about doing his physical exercises.  I join in because why not stretch?

11am – We wander around our neighborhood. We check out the Lidl and its chip selection. We walk along Esplanadi, one of the main drags and get to the harbor market.

12pm – We buy the Helsinki Cathedral combo ticket ($21.51) and enjoy seeing statues of Luther.  On the plaza, we see Kauniste, a clothing and fabric store and I can't resist and buy lots of fabric ($176.38).

1pm -  Sebastian tries to get money changed while I sit in the park watching strange musical acts on a small public stage.

2pm – We walk to a nearby food hall and share the salmon soup and reindeer kebab and 2 waters ($37.1).

2:40pm - We catch the ferry to Suomenlinna, a UNESCO World Heritage site and former fortress ($19.36).  People can still live there and we check out the church (included in the previously purchased combo ticket).  We go to the museum to get a little context on the island ($19.36) and Sebastian falls asleep during the explanatory video. I also get to introduce Sebastian to the concept of taking photos with cannons so they look like your dick.

7pm – Rest in the room. We get dinner at a nearby Armenian restaurant, munching on “snack plate” (this trip's most iconic dish, essentially charcuterie, but better), beef blini, lamb chops, honeycake, beer and wine ($131.21).

** FRI June 21**

6:45am – Sebastian has a golf tee time at the [Helsinki Golf Club](https://helsingingolfklubi.fi/).  He takes the train ($3.17) and spends on greens fees, golf club rental, and souveniers ($135.46).  I lounge in bed, eat breakfast, shower and plan our logistics for tomorrow's ferry.

9am – I am getting kicked out of my job in September and have gotten no traction with job applications so far.  I check all my job boards, find three jobs to apply to and write up the first application.

11am – I walk to Sinebrychoff, a nearby art museum only to find it closed for Midsummer. I fail to go literally anywhere, since all attractions are closed for Midsummer and wander aimlessly for miles in downtown Helsinki.

1pm – I finally give up and wait for Sebastian at the train station.  It costs us $10 a day to use our phone internationally, so I try to be very conservative and use free Wifi whenever I can.  I get a drink at [Olivia](https://library.avecmedia.fi/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ravintola2-1-scaled-e1648040517298.jpg), a highly aesthetic restaurant with impeccable vibes.  Sebastian arrives having received a ride into town from his new golf friends. I have a hugo spritz and white pizza with prosciutto and Sebastian gets a beef pasta ($79.56).

3pm – We rest at the hotel and I work on more job applications.

6pm – We go to a free concert, but get tired of sitting on hard concrete.  On the way back to the hotel, Sebastian gets dinner at Chicken Joint ($14.94).  We wrap up the evening playing board games in the room.

**SAT June 22**

6am - Wakeup, doing our morning stretches and pack.  We fail getting breakfast (they open the buffet later on weekends) and walk to the port.

8:30am – We embark and go right to the cafeteria.  We both get the meatballs ($27).

11am – We arrive in Tallinn and get a taxi to our hotel ($10).  We tactically drop our stuff and taxi ($15) to the [Kadriog Museum](https://kadriorumuuseum.ekm.ee/en/) ($25.74).  It's an art museum in a former palace of Catherine the Great's.  Then, we go to [KUMU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumu_(museum)) ($30.02), the modern art museum, rushing around before they close at 3.  Free from our time crunch, we then chill in the park and slowly amble back to our hotel, stopping in a Humana thrift store.

6pm – We catch a taxi ($21.55) to dinner at [NOA](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/harju/tallinn/restaurant/noa).  Sebastian and I are both big foodies and we prioritized having two splurge meals at Michelin star restaurants on this trip to celebrate our anniversary and my birthday.  Appetizers were brought on tiny leaves and hung from a metal tree.  We got to talk to one of the chefs (he spoke fluent English as did most people on this trip) as he explained his cooking techniques.  We felt like children in the loving embracing of loving parents.  Truly some of the best food I've ever had ($468.60 for the tasting menu and wine).  In bliss, we get a taxi back to reality ($18.12).

**SUN June 23**

10:30am – We set out for the day and happen upon [Rukis](https://rukis.ee/eng).  We feast on a lox sandwich, a breakfast plate with fish, coffee, a mooni roll (poppy seed heavy), and a pistachio eclair ($37.85).

11:15am – We spy an Estonian handicrafts store and get Christmas presents for everyone including leather belts, alpaca wool, elk jerky, and more ($481.14).  

12:45pm – We stop in at the Alexander Nevsky Church and I buy a candle and a postcard ($4.5).  I love to light candles in churches and pray for all my friends and family.  I'm also a big postcard sender and love sending people a little treat.  I buy more random postcards while wandering ($2).

2:30pm - I'm still full from breakfast, but Sebastian buys a kebab, Coke and water ($11).  We get a cab to the aiport to pickup our rental car ($24).  I plan to do all of the driving so that we don't have to pay the two drivers fee.

5pm – Though initially terrified for some reason to drive in a foreign country, I quickly realize that the only trick is to drive slow and stay calm.  We arrive at the Open Air Museum ($53.62) and explore before the main event.  When planning the trip, I knew it was going to be around Midsummer (celebrated in Estonia as St. John's Day or Jannipaev) and though it's traditionally a family holiday like July 4th, I wanted to have a confirmed location where we could go to enjoy.  The Open Air Museum's celebration is magical.  We fuel up with two sausages ($10), two ice creams ($7), and Sebastian gets a Saku beer ($6). They have people in traditional dress doing line dances and partner dances and dance competitions and bonfires.  I convince Sebastian to sing Estonian folk songs with me in an 18th century school house (they had printed out lyrics and we made do).  Utterly exhausted (we walked 12 miles that day), we leave at 10pm.

**MON June 24**

10am – Don't fix what ain't broken, so we dine at Rukis again: coffee, entrees, pastries, water ($54).  We pay for hotel parking on our way out ($26.81).  We start our drive to Kasmu, a small fishing village.  When planning the trip, I wanted to schedule in some down time to experience nature in Lahemaa National Park.  We listen to “The Year of The Hare” by Arto Paasilinna during the drive.  I couldn't find many book by Estonian authors available, so I settled for a Finnish author.  

1pm -  We arrive and go on a walk to kill time until we can check into our cottage at 3.  We then go grocery shopping.  The minimart is tiny, but we enjoy seeing the differences in grocery selection ($60.62).

4:30pm – I start reading “The Sea” by John Banville on the patio while Sebastian cooks dinner.  Later, we watch two episodes of Fallout and are asleep by 11pm.

**TUE June 25**

8am - Sebastian makes breakfast.  Ready for the day, we head out on a hike around the peninsula.  We see barely another soul out in the forest, but do come across a swan skeleton and lots of giant boulders (helpfully marked on the tourist map).  We get a little turned around in the end and stumble back out of the forest much later than we intended.

3:15pm – We drive to [Sagadi](https://visitestonia.com/en/sagadi-manor), a country manor, and head right to the restaurant.  We regain humanity after a snack plate for two, two mains, and dessert ($81).  While we wait for our food, I read some r/HobbyDrama posts out loud to Sebastian about hiking.  We visit the manor ($10) and walk around with a binder with English labels for each room.  We wander the grounds and learn that the manor is also partially an ecology experience for school children.

6pm – Back at the cottage, I apply for two jobs, read and fail at Hanabi (a two player logic card game).


**WED June 26**

7:30am – I wake up, but as a kind and generous wife, I let Sebastian sleep in another hour.   He makes breakfast and then we fully pack and clean up the cottage.

11:30am – We arrive at [Hara](https://visitestonia.com/en/hara-harbour-submarine-base), a formerly secret, formerly Soviet submarine base.  Tickets are $10 total, which is half off because the electricity is out and therefore all of the informative videos aren't working.  I thought it would be cool to visit in an “urban exploring crumbling” kind of way, but instead it's just “decrepit, ugly, concrete”.  The restaurant does kindly give us tap water for free.

1pm – A must-see for me, the [Viru Bog](https://visitestonia.com/en/viru-nature-trail).  When your tourism website has a whole [article](https://visitestonia.com/en/visiting-estonian-bogs-a-complete-guide-for-a-tourist) about bogs, you know you gotta get your bog on.  It is a fascinatingly delicate environment where signs warned that even a single footprint would damage the environment for 100 years.  We proceed on two planks of wood like railway ties.  There was a gorgeous lookout where you could see the bog for miles.  Against regulations, many people were swimming in the bog which I found terrifying because bog water is sepia colored and therefore opaque (and therefore, monsters in the bog).

3:30pm – Making our way west across Estonia, we stop at the [Jagala waterfalls](https://visitestonia.com/en/jagala-waterfall), Estonia's widest falls.  The top of the waterfall was very flat and we enjoyed wading, but didn't want to swim and then be damp in the car for several hours.  We stop at an Olerex gas station and get two ice creams, one weird hot dog, a pastry and a water ($10).

6:30pm – We arrive in Parnu, the third largest city in Estonia and summertime vacation capital.  I wanted to stay near the beach and treated us to a beautiful historic spa, the [Hedon Hotel](https://www.hedonspa.com/en/) ($470.67 for two nights).  We are tired from our long day of driving and eat at the hotel on their patio, enjoying the beachgoers walking past ($56.42).

**THU June 27**

7:30am -  I wake up and let Sebastian sleep in, but get bored and wake him up after an hour.  I go to the included breakfast buffet and read my book.  I have second breakfast with Sebastian when he finally arrives at 9:30.

10am – We start our day at the spa.  We do a few laps of the various temperature pools, steam room and sauna.  Spa-ed out, we head to the beach.  It is so hot and the ocean is rather eerie.  Parnu is set in a large sheltered bay and the ocean is very shallow.  I walked out like 400 yards and it was only to my waist.  It's not vacation if you don't have ice cream so we pit the two competing brands, Premia ($3.5) and Balbino ($3).  Sebastian wants to go rest and I stay at the beach a little longer and then get a little more spa time in.

6pm – Sebastian finds us this restaurant which is located in city hall for some reason.  Regardless, [Hea Maa](https://heamaa.ee/en/) was excellent and we got snack plate for two (a classic), lamb, pork, cheesecake, two wines, a beer and perry (like a pear hard cider) ($79.33).

**FRI June 28**

7am – An early morning because I need to get Sebastian to the [Parnu Bay Golf Links](https://parnubay.com/) by 8am ($162.01 on greens fees, glub rental, and balls).  On the drive back, I have a bathroom emergency and barely survive with my life.

10am -  I walk around the town, buying playing cards ($7.5) and postcards ($3).  I check us out of our room and driveI back to the golf course. While waiting, I get an apple mint soda ($5.36).  Sebastian surprises me by finishing early and we peruse the merch store ($90.12).

2pm – Even though it's the opposite direction from where we need to go, I insist we get lunch at [Villa Ammende](https://ammende.ee/en/), a historic Art Noveau mansion.  We try to figure out the parking app, but flail around as we do not have an European cell phone number to register an account.  I give up and go to a physical payment kiosk ($10.73), but by the time I return to the car to put the payment slip, I've already gotten a ticket.  Nothing to do but enjoy a lunch of snack plate, fish soup, a chicken caesar salad, a beer and pink lemonade ($79.39).

3:30pm – We see signs indicating there is a medieval market happening.  I am a Renaissance Faire veteran and  am quite underwhelmed with the vendor selection and most low-effort attempts at theming.  We give up and head out for the drive to Riga.

7pm - We arrive and pay for 5 days of parking and hotel city tax ($80.47).  Not wanting to settle in just yet, we get assorted groceries ($24.68).

**SAT June 29**

7:30am – Yet again, I wake up and let him sleep.

9:30am - We pack up and get rolling to the central market.  It's a mainly a giant food hall and we do a progressive breakfast, sampling numerous vendors: a sausage roll, cinnamon roll and coffee ($3), a cream pastry ($0.5), khachapuri (a bread boat filled with cheese) and bellass (a meat dumpling thing) ($3.7), beer ($4.2), and iced coffee ($4.5). We played cribbage at one of the long tables and chatted with some Canadians.

12pm – We start a walking tour, following an online article I pre-load on my phone. We stop at St. John's Church   ($4, entrance fee and to light a candle), St. Peter's Church ($14), the Metzendorff house ($6), and the [Brotherhood of Blackheads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotherhood_of_Blackheads) ($10).  After getting kicked out exactly at 5pm, I get 5 postcards and a Christmas ornament in the gift shop ($10).

5:30pm – We stop at a restaurant on the general way back to our hotel and get a caesar salad, pulled pork, beer, cherry flavor balsam (a traditional liquor I felt obligated to try) and a water ($43.3).

7:30pm – We buy laundry detergent and a seasoning packet from the grocery store ($7.9).  We rot in bed and I agonize about the precise schedule for the next few days. Shower, read, message family and asleep by 10:40pm.

**SUN June 30**

6:45am – We do our morning stretches and prep for the day.  We get a quick breakfast from the central market including a dry pastry, cheese and spinach bread, coffee and pizza (6), and caramel eclair and to go coffee (3.50).  Then, we get in the car and drive about an hour to [Turaida](https://www.latvia.travel/en/sight/turaida-museum-reserve), a large historic castle complex ($15.5 for two tickets and parking).  We enjoy wandering around the buildings and seeing the vista from the top of the tower.

1pm – While in Estonia, we were bombarded with advertisements for a limited edition waffle burger and we finally gave in and had to try it, but tragically, it is not offered at the Hesburger we stop at, so we get 2 burger meals and a side of wings ($17).

2pm – While waiting to take the cable car ($38), we watch some people doing lay flat zipline.  We cross the river and stroll along the other side.  We then go to a kiddie amusement park full of ride and take a toboggan ($10) to the valley floor.  We sit for a while, watching the children play and adults look like fools in giant inflatable balls.

4:10pm -  We arrive at [More safari park](https://www.latvia.travel/en/sight/more-safari-park) ($14) and feed their large stock of various domesticated (?) deer and elk.

6:30pm – Tired from our long day, Sebastian makes a basic pasta dinner in the room (it's kinda bad, but no fault of his) and I look for more jobs.

**MON July 1**

7:30am – Wake up, stretch and breakfast on leftover sadness pasta.  We are on the road and get to Rundale Palace by 10 ($23 for two day tickets).

11:30am – We start with the grounds, seeing the ornamental trees and huge plots of roses.  A sudden storm comes upon us and we take shelter in a greenhouse cafe, playing cribbage and sipping two lattes and one beer ($12).  We check out around the inside of the palace, thoroughly enjoying the English audioguide.

4pm - We drive to the [Mezs Kungs](https://www.mezs-kungs.lv/) restaurant and get solyanka soup, chicken shashlik, venison khinkali and a chocolate cake made to look like a flower pot ($53).  Before we drive to Riga, we fill up the car ($45).  Once we get back to our hotel, we play more Hanabi, do laundry and rest.

**TUE July 2**

6:45am – Wake up early because we have a long drive today.  Sebastian stretches while I shower.  We walk to the central market and get pastries and coffee, cream puff ($1.2), large pierogies ($5.5), coffee and poppyseed pastry ($2.5) and a cinnamon bun ($0.5).  We hit the road by 8.

10:30am – We arrive in the most northern part of Lithuania to visit the Hill of Crosses.  This little day trip is at least partially so I can add Lithuania to my list of countries I've been to.  We wend our way through the little paths on the hill and when done, buy a cross of our own to put on the hill ($6), 3 postcards, a magnet and a keychain ($11) and an all amber rosary for my grandma ($60).

12pm – We drive to Šiauliai (or as Sebastian said, Shai Hulud), the nearest big city.  We park ($5) and get two lunch specials (tacos and soup), 1 beer and 1 cappuccino ($30).  We have a digestion walk and see the memorial from when Pope John Paul II visited.  We walk to the Cat Museum ($10.78).  It's small and kitschy, but just the right level of exertion for us.  We pet the multiple cats who live in the museum.  We leave Šiauliai at 3:30.

5:45pm – Once back in Riga, we finish up the final part of the walking tour we didn't complete on 6/29.  We pop into a few tourist stores to see if any souvenirs speak to us and buy a beautiful painted Christmas ornament for Sebastian's mom ($20).

7:30pm – Unable to fathom any more decisions, we settle on a Russian restaurant we pass by: rabbit cream stew, dumplings, hand pie assortment plate, quince lemonade, horseradish cranberry cocktail and are cursed with free vodka shots that taste like seawater ($80.84).

**WED July 3**

7:35am – We have a date with a ferry in another country so today is a transit / get-shit-done day.  We pack and journey one last time to the central market and get five total pastries and a latte ($12.6), a 6-pack of honey as gifts ($6.9) and pastilia to bring back as a treat for my coworkers ($4.2).

9:35am – We are on the road to Tallinn and listen to one of our favorite stupid men podcasts, 100% Eat.  

1pm – Back in Tallinn, we pay for parking ($1.5) and return to a store we had been to previously and commit to an amber necklace and a set of earrings for Sebastian's mom and sister-in-law respectively ($240.78 + $5.37 for boxes).  Sebastian really needs the bathroom so I get a coffee and dry cookies as more coworker snacks at our old haunt Rukis ($9).

3:30pm - We fill up car ($50.52) and return it, explaining about the parking ticket and receive the final car charges ($520.49) after which we taxi to the ferry terminal ($16).

5pm – While we wait for the ferry, Sebastian gets beer and fries in the ferry terminal ($10.21).  We play Hanabi to pass the time.

7pm - On the ferry, we share a Salisbury steak dinner ($13.5) and play cribbage. Later, Sebastian gets hungry ($10).  We arrive back in Helsinki and get a taxi to our new hotel ($32).

**THU July 4**

7:30am – Today is our final full day on vacation and we left this as a “clean up” day to do all the final touristing and shopping we needed to do. We eat the included breakfast, definitely the saddest of the ones on the trip.

9:30am – I buy 9 international stamps for all my postcards that I had written while on the ferry ($24.5).  We stop into Body Shop to buy my mom's favorite lotions as a Christmas present ($22.2).  I then agonize forever in Marimekko, but finally decide to buy 6 yards of a fruit print, 3 yards of another pattern, 1 art book and an apron as a present for a friend ($374).

11am – We drop our heavy purchases back at the hotel, then go into Flea, a secondhand store we saw earlier.  They have a gorgeous selection of high end designers and Sebastian gets really excited, picking out a lot for me to try on. I buy two dresses, a silk cocktail dress and a comfy maxi ($72).

12:30pm - We walk to harbor and learn that we are there for the Tall Ships Festival, a sailing celebration with lots of international ships including one from South America!  Sebastian gets a reindeer dog ($8.06).  I demand we see all the cool ships. Once we finish our ship circuit, we stop in the harbor market and get multiple jams for presents ($36).

4pm – We return to the hotel because I've started to feel very sick with my chronic illness.  Sebastian wanders to a hobby store, but doesn't get anything.

5 pm - We get ready for our second fancy meal.  Having recovered sufficiently, we walk there, albeit slowly because I'm in heels. We get dinner at [Olo](https://olo-ravintola.fi/en/).  The restaurant feels empty, but we are assured that there are, in fact, other guests. We are seated at what is essentially a small counter with an open window into the prep kitchen.  It is absolutely fascinating to watch the very talented chefs work and we get little previews of what the upcoming courses will be as the chefs prepare them for the other tables.  We have some of the best sourdough I've had in my life ($639.62).  We leave happy and full and a random woman on the street compliments my dress.

**FRI July 5**

7am – We wake up and see all of our flight details have been changed on us and we have less of a rush to the airport.  We pack and eat breakfast and do a final saunter near the water.

10:30am – We drag our suitcases (one wheel has failed on us) to the train station and catch the train to the airport ($8.2).

12pm - We check in and go to the VAT refund booth (+48).  After security, we get mediocre food, shrimp pasta and pulled pork nachos and side salad ($47.91). On the flight, I I watch an unhinged trio of The Big Lebowski, Anyone But You, and Room.  My mom picks us up at 8:30pm US time.

**Final Thoughts** 

Honestly, I am shocked at how much we spent.  It could have easily been 3k cheaper with fewer gifts, souvenirs, fancy meals and golf.  We knew it was going to be a splurge and specifically saved up for it.  It was really nice not to have to sweat meal prices or live in sadness that I didn't buy the thing I wanted.  But I don't regret it at all.  I will think about this trip for the rest of my life.  I joked a lot with Sebastian that this trip “healed” me.

I have already spent so many hours and words on this write-up but I will save the rest of my thoughts for comments and questions.

We get accused of being woke by Conservatives and being fascists by Liberals … because obviously, very mature and level headed people.

Both of us think this whole ‘boycott’ US products is just another example of being full of shit, and my GF hypothesized that us, being healthy eaters, we already buy/eat local and if you’re buying predominantly US products, you’re most likely shopping at big box stores, running after specials, etc etc. Basically, it’s a lifestyle.

So we did the experiment this morning and she just texted me a while ago only “I think I’m onto something” ie we split the groceries (I did the staples, and she’s doing the “specific”) and here is what I bought and didn’t specifically go out of my way to look at the what/where

World is full of things that lure us toward desire and easy pleasures.

TT was banned for a day, and people almost went crazy. Notifications, colors, sounds—all *specifically* designed to keep us hooked.

Wanted to share my framework to it (part one out of two)

# what is cheap dopamine and why is it addictive

First, let's understand how our brain works.

It's a typical struggle–short term pleasure vs. long term goal.

Of course, dopamine is necessary. Our brain releases it in anticipation of a reward. It rewards us for things necessary for survival—sex, food, social connection.

But, *cheap dopamine* comes from quick, effortless sources. 

Our brain makes choices *relatively*, not absolutely—it compares choices to make a decision. If given a choice between chocolate and Brussels sprouts, most people will choose chocolate—it simply provides more dopamine.

But now, technology has hacked this system even further. Instead of chocolate we have fast food, and social media. 3 seconds is the average attention span. Each interaction with your phone is like a slot machine game. Low effort, high reward.

So if you’re reading this, you’re already doing a hard cognitive exercise.

# Dopamine detox

First of all, you *can’t* eliminate dopamine entirely. Morning jog, food, chat with a friend—all of these are sources of dopamine.

But, you *can* reset baseline levels of it. So, sometimes you need to go monk mode to return even stronger.

I did that couple of years ago and am grateful for this, and now I’ll share the framework with you.

There are 3 levels to this reset. I challenge you to try one—choose the level that’s difficult enough to push you but still exciting.

# Easy mode.

If you're first timer, this is still a great place to start.

It takes 24 hours—so choose a day where you don’t have obligations (eg. Sunday).

World is full of things that lure us toward desire and easy pleasures.

TikTok was banned for a day, and people almost went crazy. Notifications, colors, sounds—all *specifically* designed to keep us hooked.

Wanted to share my framework to it (part one out of two)

# what is cheap dopamine and why is it addictive

First, let's understand how our brain works.

It's a typical struggle–short term pleasure vs. long term goal.

Of course, dopamine is necessary. Our brain releases it in anticipation of a reward. It rewards us for things necessary for survival—sex, food, social connection.

But, *cheap dopamine* comes from quick, effortless sources. 

Our brain makes choices *relatively*, not absolutely—it compares choices to make a decision. If given a choice between chocolate and Brussels sprouts, most people will choose chocolate—it simply provides more dopamine.

But now, technology has hacked this system even further. Instead of chocolate we have fast food, and social media. 3 seconds is the average attention span. Each interaction with your phone is like a slot machine game. Low effort, high reward.

So if you’re reading this, you’re already doing a hard cognitive exercise.

# Dopamine detox

First of all, you *can’t* eliminate dopamine entirely. Morning jog, food, chat with a friend—all of these are sources of dopamine.

But, you *can* reset baseline levels of it. So, sometimes you need to go monk mode to return even stronger.

I did that couple of years ago and am grateful for this, and now I’ll share the framework with you.

There are 3 levels to this reset. I challenge you to try one—choose the level that’s difficult enough to push you but still exciting.

# Easy mode.

If you're first timer, this is still a great place to start.

**Rules:**

It takes 24 hours—so choose a day where you don’t have obligations (eg. Sunday).

**What you can’t do:** your phone, computer, games, porn / masturbation, drugs, stimulating food, sugar.

For a 18.8:300 g brew:
93-97°C water (normally on 95, but sometimes in the 75-80s when doing a longer bloom with naturals or anaerobics), 21-24 clicks on the C40. 

60 g bloom in about 15 seconds for 45-90 seconds (longer when using a lower temperarure), then 3 * 80 g equal pours for the V60 every 30-35 seconds, or 2 * 120 g equal pours for the Kono and letting the water drain completely between each pour – less bypass on the latter brewer, so I don't need to worry about filling the water line too high. 

For V60 I aim to do the first and second pour (after the bloom) in about 15 seconds, but the last almost as slow as possible from a low pour height while still maintaining laminar flow. For the Kono, each pour (after the bloom) takes a bit longer than 15 seconds, maybe 20 or so. Very little agitation on both recipes, and more of a shake after each pour. 

I guess I pour from a medium height on average? 

Depending on the result, I first try varying the grind size +- a few clicks, then the pour rate – sometimes a more aggressive first pour, like 80 g in less than ten seconds, or for longer than 15 seconds if the coffee has more fines. ",0,1738508826.0,pourover,1,0.33,False

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\

My wife and I will be scouting Northern Portugal February 19-28 and wonder whether any current expats would be interested and available for a cup of coffee (or lunch or whatever) on us to share your experience. Originally, we were considering it on a digital nomad visa because I currently work remotely for my company and Portugal was likely going to be an even better location. With the current stop work order on US foreign assistance, it’s quite possible that I may be unemployed, in which case we would be considering it from a retirement angle. We’re flying in and out of Porto and currently have planned a few days in each of the following:

- Viana do Castelo 
- Braga and Guimaraes
- Coimbra
- Porto

We’re mainly interested in the north because:
- the weather sounds similar to where we live now
- there seem to be enough expats to find community until we become at least somewhat conversant with the language
- we might put less pressure on the housing market (Porto is more of the tourist part of the trip rather than at the top of the location list).

Looking to Upgrade from Baratza Encore ESP [$1200],"I'm looking for new electric grinder that can dial in light and medium light roasts. I currently have a Rocket Appartamento that I adjusted to 9 bar and a Baratza Encore ESP. Lately, I have been grinding on 0 and pulling shots that are around 20 seconds for a medium to dark roast bean. Shots pull even faster for anything light than that. Part of the issue might be that the ring burr holder is cracked, but that replacement parts have been sold out for weeks. I prefer drinking cortados and cappuccinos, but don't often go for drinks with more milk. On average we pull about 4 shots per day.

I'm open to suggestions, but here are some machines I've been considering are:  
\- DF83V - can't decide on the burrs, I'm leaning toward the SSP HU, but the MP burrs sound intriguing

\- DF64V - I have the same question about the burrs as I do for the DF83V

\- Eureka Mignon - leaning toward the Turbo because of the build quality, hopper, and motor, but I'm worried about the burr sizes and limiting my options in the future

\- Mazzer Philos - haven't done much research, but I saw it mentioned here

\- Niche Duo - I haven't don't much research into this one, but I know these have a great reputation

Another question I have is what makes grinders good for light espresso? Will I be hitting the bottom limit for grind size on the ones I mentioned or will I have some room to experiment? My local coffee shop roasts their beans very lightly and they pull excellent shots using their Mahlkonig e65, which I know is a commercial grinder (I've considered it, but it probably won't fly in my household).

From the Don Quijote of Meet-ups. 

I am doing it for 4 Months now. Different Locations, different texts and different flavour.
 
A Text and a picture, maybe somebody made the afford to go on my Profil, but in the end an relativ anonymous indefer. 

And that's the main culprit behind the indifference. 

Why care? 

The Meet-up antis have been to one Meet-up two years ago drunk and had one bad experience and that's why every Meet-up must be like that. And they are very vocal about it.

So it's easy better not to try at all. It's not the right weather , distance and entertainment factor anyway. 
There could be something better. 

I don't want to make it political but don't come me with the ""everybody is on the demonstrations"" excuse. There is plenty of time to both events. 

In the end it's my own fault for not cancelling. 

20 something karma and 0 Feedback. Maybe because the topic wasn't clubs, drugs or dating? 

I thought about a 2 weeks cycle. But after this week it feels I wait and make it on demand. 

The only real thing I wish/demand is open honest communication.

I currently live in Colorado, which is great for skiing and pretending I’m an outdoorsy person, but I grew up in New York and seriously miss the water. Also, summer here is basically living inside a dehydrator—I’m sick of feeling like a human piece of jerky.

So, I’m looking for a secondary home for summers and weekends, and I’ve narrowed it down to Seattle, WA or Portland, ME. Here’s what I want:

	•	**Four actual seasons** – not just “winter” and “slightly warmer winter”. Love the fall weather and water views.

	•	**Waterfront vibes** – I want to sip coffee while staring dramatically at the ocean like I’m in a moody indie film

	•	**Mountains nearby** – because I do like hiking, just not in 100-degree desert air

	•	**Liberal, walkable, historic town feel** – I want quirky bookstores, farmers’ markets, and places where I can drink overpriced craft beer while judging tourists

	•	**Good sailing scene** – not that I own a boat (yet), but let me dream

	•	**Less expensive than California** – I love it, but I’m not selling a kidney for a one-bedroom shack

We met for the first time a month and a half ago, and since then, we've hung out about 7-8 times. Our dates usually last 5-6 hours—mostly in cafes, once by the sea, and we also love driving around while listening to music.

He’s incredibly intelligent and well-read—a dentist currently unemployed while continuing his education to specialize. With each meeting, I’ve felt our chemistry deepen, and I’ve found myself falling for him.

At first, I was confused because he wasn’t affectionate—no touching, no flirty comments, nothing that indicated romantic interest. It made me wonder if he was even attracted to me. But since we kept meeting, I reassured myself that he must like me at least on some level. Then, on our fourth date—New Year’s Eve—he kissed me. And wow, my heart nearly exploded.

After that, we continued seeing each other and texting a lot. Our conversations are deep—we discuss politics, history, religion, and he always has interesting insights. I love talking to him.

But as my feelings grew stronger, I felt I needed clarity. So, I asked, *""What is this?""* And he surprised me by saying that we’re only friends for now and that it’s too early to be anything more than that.

I was heartbroken. I didn’t even process what he was really saying—I just assumed he didn’t have feelings for me at all. So, in that moment, I told him that if he didn’t feel the same way, I should just leave and cut off contact to protect myself. He kept asking why I’d make that decision when we were having such a good time together. I told him I didn’t want to get hurt. He insisted that we should at least talk about it in person.

A few days later, he texted and asked to meet. When we did, he wanted to know everything I was feeling. But I was too emotional, so I just said that I was heartbroken and that I had to walk away. He told me that I was forcing him to either reciprocate my feelings immediately or lose me completely, and that it was unfair. I was defensive and kept saying I had to protect myself. He asked me what I meant by *""ending things""*—if that meant we wouldn’t even say hi if we ran into each other. I told him I just wanted to stop talking.

Then, he did something that completely broke me—he said that if we weren’t together, he had to return a gift I made for him. At first, I refused, but he insisted, saying he couldn’t keep it if we weren’t in each other’s lives because it would just remind him of me. So, I took it back. He hugged me, then left.

That moment has been haunting me ever since. I texted him as soon as I got home, asking him to take the gift back if I ever meant anything to him. But he said he couldn’t.

After thinking about everything, I realized I made a mistake. The next day, I texted him saying I wanted to start over. I told him that whether we’re just friends or something more, what matters is the amazing time we have together, and that I don’t meet someone like him every day.

His response? *""I'll give you some time to think and make a final decision.""*

I told him this *was* my final decision. But then he surprised me again by saying, *""Then, I guess I need to think about this.""*

That was three days ago. And now, I’m dying to hear from him. I just need peace of mind, whatever his answer is.

I’m thinking of texting him today and asking to grab coffee and talk, but I don’t know if I should.

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1ify8la,https://www.reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/1ify8la/really_strange_message_found_on_wiki_dot/,really strange message found on wiki dot,"recently, I found a strange notification on Google titled: a passing rain upon clicking, it brought me to an article on wikidot and here’s what it said:  ""Again? I… I mean… I understand. Sorry."" Alex sighed, getting up from a kneeling position and stashing a gold ring in his shirt pocket.

""You have nothing to be sorry for, honeybee."" Faeowynn stood opposed to her boyfriend. ""It's just… I… I don't know if I'm emotionally ready. It's been hell. The animals and… everything. I… Sorry, Alex.""

Alex walked to the guard railing of the cliffside spot they had stopped at to watch the sun set in. He leaned forward on the railing and bit his lower lip. ""Maybe the fifth time will be the charm,"" he whispered to himself when he was certain Fae couldn't hear him. The feelings of rejection washed away as he stared out at the sun kissing the Oregon wilds good night.

Fae awkwardly approached him, placing a hand on his shoulder, then gently tracing it towards his neck. She then rested her arm and head on his shoulder, sighing. ""It's not that I don't love you. I do, it's just that—""

""I know, Fae."" Alex interrupted. ""I'm worried about you. You haven't been the same since that day."" He turned to face her fully, standing on his tiptoes to kiss her.

""My psychiatrist thinks that I'm coping well enough, thank you very much,"" she teased in response.

""You only see him once a week. I see you all day every day. Plus you were able to ignore feelings about your dad's passing for years. I know you better than you think.""

She frowned.

His expression remained neutral.

""Tell him about what happened."" Alex insisted after a brief silence.

Fae cursed under her breath as darkness started to set in overhead.

""I'll think about it.""





The clouds in the sky were grey and threatening rain, but that didn't stop Fae as she approached the shadow of a massive redwood. She looked down at a marble tombstone, so out of place in the middle of the woods. A man-made structure amidst nature. Ironic considering who was buried there.

TIM WILSON

FATHER, HUSBAND, FRIEND, LOVER OF NATURE

02/29/1956 - 07/16/2024

With a hefty groan, Fae sat cross-legged in front of her father's grave.

""Hey, dad.""

Deathly silence was her only response. Fitting.

""I suck at emotions. Why does Alex like me again?""

A bird flew overhead.

""Anyway. There's something I haven't told you. The animals they… well. It's bigger than just them. Mister Tarpan, Captain Esau, and Doctor Everwood said this affected the entire world."" She sighed. ""The critters… at least the special ones. Most of them anyway. They don't know why, but they…"" Her voice trailed off.

Memories of the day flooded her mind. Dozens of animals with anomalous abilities, all of them fading quickly. The more magical they were, the faster they required euthanization. Some of them were able to survive, albeit with what made them special robbed of them, and still becoming quite ill in the process.

A squirrel chittered from a nearby redwood.

""I guess I wanted to say sorry. The Center is probably going to continue, but as a zoo with normal animals. I know you cared a lot about these critters, and how special they were. I just… I feel like it's my fault somehow. The rational part of my brain knows it's not true, but fuck me, you know? I guess you wouldn't know. You were too earnest for this kind of thing. And too dead. Heh.""

She looked up. A ray of sunshine peeked through the dark clouds overhead. The distant rumble of thunder and a rush of wind that nearly knocked her hat off told her it was time to go.

""Sorry I can't stay long today. It's about to rain. Catch you next week, dad.""

Fae got up and kissed her index and middle finger of her left hand, then touched it to the marble tombstone. She walked back to her truck, leaving nothing but footprints in her wake. Footprints which would soon be washed away by a passing rain.





Dawn found Fae waking after Alex had already gotten up in their Boring home. The scent of coffee wafted in from the kitchen, which she smiled at. She hated the taste, but it did wonders for waking her up. Especially considering she drank it pitch black and without sugar. She got up, still wearing an oversize tshirt, which was hard to find considering she was 6'4 and her boyfriend, which most women would steal shirts from, was 5'9.

""Hey,"" Alex said, holding two cups, offering the one with a butterfly on it to her.

""Hay is for horses."" She replied, accepting the drink and taking a scalding hot sip.

""How did it go with your psychiatrist last night?""

A pause.

""Good. Why?"" Fae questioned, setting the mug on the kitchen table.

Alex shrugged, a smile forming on his sweet, mustached face. He took a sip from his own mug, which depicted a bear on it. ""Just curious. What did you say his name was?""

Fae blinked. ""I don't think I told you.""

""That's why I'm asking.""

""Dr. Oseman."" She lied.

Another, more pregnant pause.

""Fae…"" Alex sighed.

""What?"" Her tone betrayed her.

""There's only one psychiatry practice in Boring. I called last night and asked for a list of their practicing doctors, and Oseman is not one of them.""

""How do you know I didn't go to Portlands?""

""No one's heard of or from Portlands in months.""

""I meant Portland. Singular.""

""I know you hate it the—""

""Fine. You got me. I haven't been going to see a psychiatrist."" She folded her arms.

""I'm not upset that you lied to me. I'm upset that you didn't actually go to one after promising me you'd go."" Alex took a step towards her, putting a hand on her arm. ""Fae. I love you. I know what the Center meant to you. What it meant to your dad. It means a lot to me too. But we can't keep living in the past. You need to talk to someone. Someone qualified. As much as I wish I could help you, I can't.""

Fae sighed, to which Alex leaned in and got on is tiptoes to kiss her.

""You're right. I hear the Supervisors are offering counseling to all their employees, and we qualify as them. I'll talk to Tarpan today."" Fae was stubborn, but she was willing to see where she had been wrong.

""Thank you.""

""And thank you for sticking with me through my bullshit."" Fae cocked her head down and kissed Alex.

""So how about marrying me now?"" He teased.

I started dating this girl 2 month ago, it were the most beautiful months  of my life. However.. things were complicated..

We had a small argument around one week ago because she found out from one of my ex friends that I didn't like her that much when we first started dating. Then the next day we had another argument because I told her that I went to the coffee shop with a classmate, thinking I was with another girl.

This Friday we were dating again and talking about us. She told me that sometimes I am too immature and thats what she is currently not looking for. She also said that she is afraid that I will start liking another girl in the future and I will dump her. Then I also told her my worries, that I am going to uni soon and I don't know if I can be with her. She tried to help saying that we can see what we do until then, and that I should not worry about the future. She also tells me that she wants me to be more touchy with her, because she hates that I dont hug her, initiate, etc.  
After that, she tells me to close my eyes and we kiss. After the first, we kiss once again after a few seconds. It was beautiful.

Today she friendzones me. Asking her what I did wrong, she said that it's not my fault, which I dont really believe. Her period is in 4 days, could this be because of PMS? I know I shouldn't blame it on pms, however we had a similar experience last month when she ghosted me for 5 days straight and after that she started texting me back to normal and blaming me if I wouldn't respond to her messages in under 3 minutes.

I use the same coffee beans (18 gram) which I grind with the a DF83v grinder on the same setting. I use a damp filter which I put in the portafilter (with IMS competition series filter 16-29 gram basket) and poor the ground coffee in top of that. Then I use a WDT tool and tamp with a normcore v4. 

I, as far as I am aware of, take the exact same steps, but one shot runs too fast (say 36 grams in 21 seconds) and the next shot almost doesn’t pull. It goes drip, drip, drip. 

There has to be a reason for these different pull times, I just don’t see what it is. Any advice on what I’m overlooking? Or could a very small variation have this much influence?
