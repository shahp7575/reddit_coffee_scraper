1njyi9p,https://i.redd.it/71kljn5hdupf1.jpeg,Share your honest take on the Mustang GTD,"I‚Äôve done the vast majority of my lifetime mileage behind the wheel of a Mustang. I love everything about them. But I just can‚Äôt get with the GTD

The price is simply absurd. It is well over $100k more expensive than a faster ZR1X. People will argue that they have different clientele as the GTD is more focused on the ‚Äúhomologated race car crowd‚Äù. But they‚Äôre wrong, the GTD shares VERY little with the GT3 race car it‚Äôs supposedly based on. Much less than other homologations throughout history.

The ZR1X is faster in every situation, 400 more horsepower, has more bespoke parts, better technology, all wheel drive, and still has an actual trunk.

For $325,000+, it should be a 100% carbon body. But it isn‚Äôt, as the doors remain metal. MotorTrend‚Äôs article today stated that was for ‚Äúcost reasons‚Äù. Is Ford serious? The GTD should also have bespoke carbon framed seats. It doesn‚Äôt. It uses leftover parts bin seats from last gen‚Äôs GT500. No lightweight door panels. No alcantara headliner. But you do get ‚Äúlightweight carpets‚Äù, like that makes any difference besides saving Ford money on materials. The only thing that tells you that you‚Äôre driving something truly special on the interior is something you can‚Äôt even appreciate while driving. That suspension window is just a party trick for Cars and Coffee. Other than that you get a fancy little plaque supposedly made from ‚Äúmelted down F22 Raptor parts‚Äù. Wow! If you believe that line you must have been born yesterday. 

I read that Ford plans to sell somewhere between 300-700 per year. They are drunk. They‚Äôll get over 300 the first year, but beyond that it‚Äôll quickly fade. That 7500 applications figure that was leaked last year was before the ZR1X, which I guarantee will steal some buyers. 

I don‚Äôt understand this car. You‚Äôll have a bunch of collectors and middle eastern princes swoop up the first couple batches. Then what? Who else is gonna pay that much? Who is REALLY gonna use this thing as a track monster? 

Do you know what the GTD is? It‚Äôs a halo car for Ford‚Äôs entire lineup. But halo cars only work if people actually get to see them every now and then, especially at high end cars and coffee. That‚Äôs where the Audi R8 made a name for itself. Peak Audi but still in your average surgeon‚Äôs price range. This feels more like the Lexus LFA, a much more expensive and thus rarely seen halo car failure. When you price for the ultra-rich, you get ultra rich behavior: a strong emphasis on privacy. Mark my words, within 2 years you won‚Äôt see much of the GTD on the streets anymore as few who bought one will tuck them away like LFA‚Äôs",1,1758168588.0,Mustang,1,0.67,False
1njyfyt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1njyfyt,New headcanon: Yor Briar from Spy X Family has autism,"My reasoning:
(Apologies in advance. I did not proofread.)


‚Ä¢ She doesn‚Äôt understand other peoples‚Äô jokes or sarcasm. An example would be when a coworker told her to spit in the boss‚Äôs coffee and she replied with something along the lines of, ‚Äúdoes it make it taste better or something?‚Äù

‚Ä¢ People who know her on a surface level think she‚Äôs weird. However, the people close to her think she‚Äôs a kind-hearted, sweet, and protective person.

‚Ä¢ She was completely unbothered when a man she just met, Loid, asked to marry her and explained his reason (as much as he could anyway) for asking something so crazy. She was understanding and agreed to it quickly because she was worried about the government arresting her as being unwed at her age may be seen as suspicious under the current government.

‚Ä¢ Her initial reactions would be very much seen by others as ‚Äòunconventional‚Äô. A prime example would be that at a party one of her coworkers hosted, said coworker tried to ‚Äòaccidentally‚Äô (purposefully) toss a hot tray of food on Yor. Yor caught it easily with her leg.

‚Ä¢ Despite being an assassin since her early teens, Yor has trouble with things others may deem as trivial, such as kissing. She downed nearly half a bottle of wine to be drunk enough to possibly kiss Loid.

‚Ä¢ In the same vein as the previous point, she uses alcohol to function better in certain social situations.

‚Ä¢ From my interpretation it seems that Yor has face blindness. While being drunk and playing an elaborate game, she thought Loid, who was dressed in a mask to look like an in-universe TV show  spy character, was someone trying to harm her stepdaughter, Anya, and genuinely started fighting him, even drawing blood at some point. A sudden alcohol-induced slumber was the only thing that stopped her from continuing.

‚Ä¢ Yor‚Äôs special interest is fighting and sharp weapons. She happily teaches Anya to fight when Anya asks. She also gets entranced and flustered at the sight of sharp objects such as the painting of a guillotine in an art museum or a knife at a restaurant.

‚Ä¢ You cannot tell me that the last slide isn‚Äôt her stimming. She is definitely stimming!",1,1758168373.0,aspiememes,0,1.0,False

1njyca3,https://i.redd.it/drof5azucupf1.jpeg,Is this the beginning of root rot?,"A little bit of background... I got this orchid as a gift from a guest a little over a month ago. I have been a notorious plant murderer my entire life, somehow managing to kill even the easiest to grow plants. So this time around I did a lot of research about orchids as soon as I got it. By then I realized that the pot that the orchid had come in was very poorly ventilated not to mention that it was packed tightly in sphagnum moss. So I decided to repot it to orchid bark as you can see in the picture and a ventilated pot. 

Soon after the re-pot, I'm not sure if it was the re-potting itself causing shock or the bloom cycle ending, the stems & flowers wilted and one of the bottom most leaves yellowed. Although, two new roots have started growing since. 

Initially, after the re-pot, due to the orchid bark, I was having to water it nearly every day (I usually wait till the roots turn silverish and until a wooden coffee stirrer that I let sit in the pot for 10-15 mins doesn't come back cold). So about three weeks ago I switched to alternating between letting the roots soak in room temp water for 10-15 mins and watering with 1/4th strength orchid fertilizer. This definitely brought down the frequency of watering. But, now the current issue is that a few of the roots are now a little more olive green than their usual bright green and it has been over 2 weeks since these roots have been silvery. Is this the beginning of root rot? I did recently started using a humidifier at home for a completely different reason and the weather has been getting colder. Could it be that? 

I know I'm rambling but I'm really trying to turn over a new leaf with my plant murdering streak and it just doesn't seem to be working. I will really appreciate any advice you can give!!

TL;DR: Some of the roots of my orchid are more olive green than their usual bright green and I'm panicking cause I don't want her to die. ",1,1758168040.0,orchids,2,0.99,False

The design style I'm most attracted to is an upscale organic modern, I'm looking for serene but not rustic. 

The room has a beautiful blue tile fireplace which is the main focal point, but I also need to work in a television as we're big football fans. The current plan is to put the TV on the middle wall opposite the fireplace. This drove a layout with two couches facing each other so you could lay down against an armrest and watch either focal point. 

Ideally we would have a TV above the fireplace but it's far too tall without some sort of pulldown wall mount which I would want to be very discreet and paired with a frame tv (I suspect that it is not possible to be discreet and practical in an old house w/ Lathe and Plaster walls and a real chimney). 

I've included my vision board below and would welcome feedback on everything. My main questions are:

1) What do you think of the layout? Is there a better way of accomplishing the dual fireplace and TV goals for the room?  
2) Are there any brands you recommend that you would recommend I look at? Especially for lighting and Swivel chairs. I love Hollis+Morris as well as Faithful Roots both of which I found on this sub.

3) What would you do with the empty corner in the top left? My only current idea is a card/chess table but the space seems a bit small for the table and chairs.

She has not been officially diagnosed (we cannot get her to see anyone as she refuses to), based off the understanding we have and my sister-in-laws experience and knowledge as a nurse, my mother is hitting all the boxes for someone who has paranoid schizophrenia. She has had trauma in her life but also she is just not a nice person to be around. Every place she lived in she accused people of stealing her things (like toilet paper, and coffee....I'm not kidding) or people would snoop around her things, her paper work, that someone switched out a piece of her vacuum out to different colored one. She has stated her ex-boyfriend is actually Michael Jackson and the one who died is a fake. 

She has also accused me of dating her boyfriends anytime when I was dating someone, and we live in different cities 5hours apart. She demanded to know their licenses plates and the type of cars they have, her most recent claim was that the people she was working with are actually bionic robots and not really humans, the real humans were switched out.  I could go on, she hears voices and believes the government is out to get her and at one point she thought her ex-boyfriend was communicating with her in morse code through her emails. There is an endless list of irrational behavior, that have gone from one extreme to another.

Once a few years ago we took her to the emergency room because she kept asking us to call the police cause her ex-boyfriend is after (meanwhile we saw the texts where her ex told her to leave him alone, he then blocked her and we just saw a bunch of texts she was sending him that didn't go through). They didn't do much there, the on call psychiatrist saw her for a few minuets, and took a brief statement, gave her some medication and that was it. She took the medication for 2 days and then she started to lie to us about taking it, eventually she said ""I am not going to take those chemicals cause they are doing something to my brain."" Yeah they were probably starting to balance things out for her mentally and she thought that wasn't normal. 

Most recently she was renting a room from a co-worker who was nice enough to take her in and that did not last long as she started to accuse them of stealing her toilet paper.  She became homeless and lived in her car for the past several months, she would shower at her local gym. About a month or so ago she said that her job ended, she took it as the company closed one location and didn't have work to give her. Well turns out she was terminated with cause, which she did not register it in her mind. There is a language barrier as well with her (we live in Canada and she has lived in English speaking countries more than half her life but her English is subpar compared to what it could/should be).  She has little to no concept of reality or even remembering what she did and did not do. 

She was denied Employment Insurance because just cause for dismissal was found, and she does not understand the EI system, and she just thought she would get EI because its given for someone who has no work. With EI if there is misconduct proven that resulted in her being unemployed, then you are denied EI. In her termination letter it stated she was given 3 written warnings, which she didn't tell us about and again, we don't believe she understands what it means. She is staying with my brother and sister-in-law, who don't want her there but she has no where to go. Me and her do not have a relationship, I had an abusive childhood with her,  and the older I got and became independent from her, and the more I stood up to her the more estranged we became.  

She broke down and said things like she doesn't want to live anymore, and she has no place, she want's to unalive herself. We don't know what options we have since the system here only really does anything if she is a threat to herself and to others, which really means once she has committed the harm.  We even offered her to move back to our home country cause she would more likely get help there a lot faster there but she has nowhere to go there either. Her mother won't even take her in.

  
Its a very unfortunate situation, because it's a human being suffering and in an awful situation, but at the same she is a person we do not want around, which sounds awful, but its the truth. ",2,1758167454.0,SchizoFamilies,0,1.0,False

1njxyd2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Whistleblowers/comments/1njxyd2/attorney_that_actually_takes_retaliation_case_any/,Attorney that actually takes retaliation case? ANY advice would help at this point.,"Can anyone recommend an attorney that actually takes retaliation cases? I was just forced to leave a job for the second time after my employer found out about a case I was involved in as a whistleblower. 

I relocated the last time this happened, I did everything I could to just have a fresh start when no one would help me the last time this happened but clearly it didn‚Äôt work.

As soon as I suspected they had learned about the case I was involved in I made sure to document every time I spoke up for myself at my new job. They basically stopped providing training and started intentionally placing me in overwhelming situations once they found out, they also had a large meeting that basically outlined the case I was involved in and how they didn‚Äôt want to be accused of that. 

I was stretched thin financially when I relocated but I thought I was finally going to be able to recover and just have a fresh start when I found this job. That didn‚Äôt happen. 

Not only do I have documentation of everything but I witnessed and overheard plenty of information about this company and their practices and let‚Äôs just say they‚Äôre not going to want any attention brought their way. A small settlement shouldn‚Äôt be that difficult and would mean I have time to figure out how to move forward. 

I‚Äôve been through so much, I keep pushing forward and letting everything go. This is insane, I spoke up in 2011 because I witnessed abuse that was taking place as a result of a company committing fraud. It turned out that the same type of fraud was being committed nationwide. The government intervened as soon as the information was submitted, I met with the team of FBI agents they put together specifically to work on uncovering this fraud nationwide and they recovered hundreds of millions of dollars and shortly after they changed the way they bill for short term rehab services because of the information I pieced together and came forward with. I can prove this and court documents can prove this. The company I worked for was small and went out of business, I somehow never received a reward and now for the second time in a year I‚Äôm worried that I will end up homeless.

How is it possible that no one will help me? How is it possible that I‚Äôm in this situation? I‚Äôm a social worker, I moved on from that case and worked my way up to being a case manager for adults with developmental disabilities. Clearly I‚Äôm not going after anything in life hoping for a huge payout, I was hoping to be able to survive and live my life like everyone else. 

Because I spoke up for people that couldn‚Äôt speak up for themselves I‚Äôve spent the past two years scared, at first I was scared for my safety and now I‚Äôm terrified that I‚Äôm going to end up homeless. I‚Äôve done everything that I could have done, I‚Äôve walked away over and over again and I‚Äôve been asking for help the whole way anywhere I thought I might be able to find it. Instead I keep finding people who can‚Äôt help, they wish they could but no one who actually could help me will give me the time of day. 

I posted here over a year ago, you can see the post in my profile. I‚Äôm so exhausted and I‚Äôm terrified this time that I don‚Äôt have enough time to figure out how to try again. I never fully recovered from the first time this happened financially. This is so unfair, I know life isn‚Äôt fair but this is just so unbelievably unfair. I‚Äôve lost so much of my life to this but for a long time I looked at the impact that it had and I told myself that all of the personal loss was worth it‚Ä¶ I no longer feel that way, if this was all to teach me that I should mind my own business, that I can‚Äôt change the world and I should just learn to sit down and shut up then all I can say is message received. 

I‚Äôll never forget the times I tried to throw away the reports and paperwork I had been working with to put this case together. I specifically remember frantically dumping trash bags out and brushing old coffee grinds off the papers because I just couldn‚Äôt let it go. I keep thinking of that lately and I wish I could go back and leave those papers in the trash. I wish I could take it all back and just have my own life back, I wish I could just feel normal, safe and secure like everyone else. I no longer care about the impact that this had, if I could take it all back I would. 

I guess I already know that no one‚Äôs going to help me but for some reason I just won‚Äôt give up. If by some chance you‚Äôre reading this and you can help me I would be grateful for any advice or help I can get. ",1,1758166803.0,Whistleblowers,0,1.0,False

1njxuc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Socionics/comments/1njxuc3/iee_eii_sei_iei/,"IEE, EII, SEI, IEI...?","You must be tired of this type of post, I know üò≠ but I'm having typing problems and a terrible personality crisis. I decide for once to make this post because I have a hard time identifying with a type or knowing in what position I am using the functions. I'm considering IEI or IEE more than the others, although I'm open to any other type. If anyone can help me I will be completely grateful. And sorry for my bad English, it's not my first language. I'll write some things about myself.

- To begin with, I can say that I am someone who is shy, very shy, so outside the house I behave withdrawn, many times it would be, I can even speak quietly on certain occasions. Despite this, I do my best to be courteous to others and have good treatment. Currently in my job they put me as a waitress so that is helping me a lot because even nerves make me so nervous that I speak quickly. On my very bad days I become awkward and socially awkward, what a shame.
- Contrary to the previous point, at home or with acquaintances I can be very open, laugh and cry without problems. I like to make jokes or act in a ""clown"" way with some people with whom I have a lot of trust. Although sometimes I can also have an aggressive or defensive way of speaking if I'm in a bad mood (which leads to arguments), even if I'm trying to ""joke."" Lately I try to measure myself with this, since it comes out involuntarily (either because I want to joke or show my bad mood).
- I don't tend to talk more than other people, I tend to listen and I tend to get attention if I'm silent for too long, especially because it's also easy for me to ""go somewhere else"" if I'm not interested in interacting.
- With my emotions, some people have told me that I am dramatic, I don't know if I consider myself that way since I believe that drama is linked to the theatrical and I don't think I am theatrical. But yes, I cry or laugh or get angry easily, I don't know what I look like on the outside, I only know how these emotions impact me on the inside. I have cried and indirectly asked for comfort, as if it were the end of the world and I was asking for a rescue. But I don't always do those things when I'm sad, so I think I have more control over my emotions even if they go up or down suddenly. 
- Following the previous point, I also like others to approach me with a certain intensity. I like that they show what they feel, I am uncomfortable with seriousness or apathetic tones of voice. I suspect that my partner is an IBD or a LII, so this has caused some problems in the past since I don't usually show his emotions ""aggressively"" and I have a hard time feeling that ""his love reaches me"" (even though I know he loves me with all his soul). Nowadays both he and I adapt well to each other. 
- I value my relationships, although they are very few. In fact, I can get along well with many people, but only one or two do I feel deeply connected, and sometimes not even that because it is easy to become detached from even the closest person. This does not mean that I love or am not faithful (because infidelity is something that I do not tolerate at all, I love very strongly), it just means that sometimes I do not feel linked, ""part.""  Although I also admit that when I was little I did need validation from others, I often cried because I didn't know how important it was or I felt like ""I wasn't enough."" 
- In relation to the previous point, I think I can easily talk to someone about my problems (once I lose my shyness), that is not something that bothers me, in fact the vulnerability/weakness does not bother me in me. 
- I have a certain value system of things that I will not tolerate in someone or in myself, as I have already mentioned, for example: infidelity. There are not many things since I am very tolerant of others. But if someone touches those few values ‚Äã‚ÄãI can try to educate a little... ""Aggressively"" but it's because I act more emotionally. I'm not like that with all people actually, it depends on who commits the immorality. I don't know how to explain this part well, but I am receptive to how others live or take that value at that moment. 
- In relation to the latter, many times my way of showing that aggressiveness of moral defense is historically as if someone had hurt me deeply, crying and getting angry until the other person ""feels what I feel."" Sometimes it is not the best method but it works with people who do not understand when you explain to them politely why something is not right.
- I don't consider myself a spiteful person, especially towards strangers. There has to be a very close bond and also always be cruel and cruel for me to hold a certain grudge. It's not because I feel great empathy, it must be because I disengage easily. Even counting the bad situations I have experienced seems funny to me. I try to maintain the same treatment with everyone, even with those I don't like (even though I am further away from the latter). 
- I enjoy being alone, being accompanied by a single person or being in a group. I don't have any problems, even if I'm shy I like parties or places where a lot of people go to have fun (I even lose my shyness at times). But just as that happens, I can also be alone thinking, writing or preparing a fun recipe (I enjoy cooking, but without any obligations). If I feel bad and I am alone for a long time, I don't like loneliness so much, since sometimes I can have thoughts that scare me. It's usually strange to say it like this, but there was a time in my adolescence when I spent a lot of time alone and I was going through a bad time, so it was normal for me to have horrible periods of derealization and other types of mental confusion.
- I am aware of another person's capabilities and abilities, including their intentions. It's easy to read a person, I can read their tastes, gestures, tone of voice, etc. I can also see the opportunities that others might have.
- I hate to admit it but I am sensitive to the attitude of others towards me. That is to say, I immediately notice the tone of voice if someone is angry and that could make me feel bad for at least a while. 
- I don't consider myself a very active person but I don't consider myself lazy either. In fact, sometimes it's hard for me to stay calm because I want to do this and that at the same time, but it's usually only with fun activities. At work I usually have ""physical distractions"" in order to endure having to do this or that or even because of anxiety. I said that I am currently in the waitress position, but normally I am a cook at the cafeteria I work at (I make the cakes and such). So almost always when I arrive I take some time to get settled, maybe I'll have breakfast, maybe I'll have a coffee first, then I suddenly want to go to the bathroom. It doesn't matter. The important thing is that at the end of the day I finish with the deadlines. And how do I do it? There comes a point where my energy starts to go down, I keep it up until I look at the time and then... I start doing this and that, all at the same time. Multitasking works well for me nowadays because it's what I can do to finish on time, because I generally need pressure to work, otherwise it's very easy for me to get distracted. Despite this I try to look disciplined. In this job I'm not usually that lazy because I get a lot of pressure, but usually people complain about me for not doing things on time or not doing them at all (which has generated some arguments with some people). But it's not that I don't want to, but that I tend to forget them because there are many things that distract me or I lose energy very quickly. What's more, sometimes I even need to ""feel good"" to act, otherwise I take all the time until the deadline. It used to happen to me in the study too, I got distracted very quickly to do my homework, but luckily I was a good student.
- I like physical sensations, especially when they are intense. I like the feeling of the cold wind on my face hitting me as if it were a tornado, I like to go into the sea and feel like the water wants to submerge me to the depths, I like to get to the top of a surface and feel like I can fall at any moment. I don't usually experiment a lot but I like them because sometimes they take me out of that empty feeling that I have at least twice a week. I also like to satisfy my hunger but I hate eating too much (I think it's because in the past I had an eating disorder that I couldn't overcome 100% of today). I always enjoy new dishes, I love trying new food, new flavors, smells, textures. I like to sleep a lot and get up without fatigue. I like to take care of my health, although I am not always good and I get careless easily. Nowadays I am learning to take better care of my body, although impulsively I always put more importance on aesthetics. I lack discipline to take care of my health. Especially because I don't react in time to certain physical symptoms or I tend to exaggerate them later: for example, I can be very hungry and take a while to get up and look for something to eat, or if something hurts I wait for it to get worse before going to the doctor. I usually hold on.
-Somehow I always feel attracted to feeling bad emotionally. It sounds bad, lousy. But I always find a certain comfort in sadness, in what is melancholic, in sad songs, movies, stories. It's some kind of attraction, I don't know how to explain it well. It's a way of ""being positive if I adapt to pain."" So I tend to romanticize not for aesthetics, but for adaptation.
- It happens to me that when talking to a person I tend to get lost in my head and then respond as if I had been listening. I don't do it on purpose, but again... I get distracted a lot and easily.
- Between me and my partner, he is usually more organized and more disciplined in starting a project or whatever and he does it with good time and measure. He himself explained to me that every time he is going to start doing a task he has to take into account everything he has to do, have everything he needs to do it, measure the time of the process and divide it into equal parts to complete the task within the deadlines. For me that seems impossible and I generally climb the branches, do two or three things at a time if necessary, I can start quickly and easily get distracted in the process. 
- I tend to be homesick, all the time, very involuntarily. 
- I like the emotional connection with people, even if it is for a limited time. I like to feel the emotion. Although I also find it easier to have a certain emotional attachment to objects such as the sets of mugs I have, my drawings, my favorite songs or even with my pets (I know they are not objects, don't get me wrong).
- It is very difficult for me to explain, especially when I am nervous or ""lost in a cloud."" Sometimes I can explain pretty well, but I get easily lost in the details. I also tend to define concepts in a strange way that sometimes I end up understanding, I am terrible at speaking most of the time, so that is also partly why I tend to speak less than my interlocutor. I try to improve that, because I like to understand correctly and know how to explain what interests me. But well, it has happened to me that I end up going off on a wild ride, saying strange phrases.

1njxu12,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1njxu12,Bigfoot is a Vicious Home Invader,"Im at the police station right now while they decide what the next steps should be and if I should move somewhere.  They believe me, I believe it, and need to tell everyone this.

I will make it worth your while.

It started two weeks ago when I was heading home one night from work.  Im 29, live alone, am from Winsconsin, and recently inherited my grandpa's house Im currently trying to sell.  Well when my lights met the door it was covered in serious dents and gashes.  So I call the police next day and they inspect it - says a bear did it and reasoned it was the 40 burgers I cooked for a work potluck earlier.

The next day I call off work and go buy myself two security cameras and attach one to the front door and the other by the porch.  I sleep it off but that night the security cameras did get footage.

So Im in my towel and coffee looking over the footage before heading to work, and some creature has flung shit on both cameras overnight!  They did not capture the thing as the shit stains blocked the lenses.  This time I call the cops again and ask for dna samples.

They said it matched a fucking gorilla.

I call off work and borrow my brother's rifle (havent fired a shot 15 years, so we practiced a little) and the police trek it through the woods.  I believe the gorilla noticed I was armed, because the next two days it did nothing.  The cops found nothing.  I head back to work since I need my payroll and dont wanna lose my job.

Here's where it gets crazy.  So Im going home, my lights flare up my dumbass deadbeat of a door, I unlock it and walk in.  Yes I cleaned the cameras.  So I go up the stairs and my ankle brushes something soft.  I nearly dodge a knife strapped between duct tape and a string as it swung off the ceiling and nearly stabbed my brains out!  That fucker used my dental floss as a tripwire!  The duct tape also caught brown fur.  Now no lowland gorilla exists in this state.  Something isn't right!  See photo 1 please.

I freak out and creep up my room to unlock the rifle, and as I turn around with it I see something big run out of the porch above me and back into the woods.  If it werent for my neighbors I would have fired every round.

So this time the cops come and once again say all they can do is search again, and that looking into the footage it was never seen.  It must know where they land.

I buy eight more cameras and move my bed to the first floor so I dont get stuck upstairs.  This time I get three days of peace.  But with what happens next you'd think it was learning.  But no, it has to have done this before.  I believe it treats the situation like a game and only ups the stakes when I do.

The fourth night I am feeling woozy.  And holy fucking shir Im glad I did not fall asleep because Bigfoot cut the gas line!  In my blurred vision I saw his form walking past one of the windows close enough but just too far to see his body, and damn I wish I couldve just lit a match and take him with me.  But I was tired and wasnt thinking straight and needed to send some proof with my phone.  See photo 2 please.  I almost had a heart attack because he got up close when I decided such.  He knows, and he acts in his own viciousness.

Nothing happens for a week.  I get a little calmer and some sleep back.  My bed is still in the first floor.

Next morning I wake up, a window sill was wide open.  Im tense and slowly, surely, just ever so slowly turn my head around and luckily, I spot nothing.  But when I look down, his sweaty footprints are all around the room, and two big ones were directed at me as if he was watching my sleep.

And my gun was wrapped entirely in duct tape.  He did that in my sleep.  How the fuck soes somethinh so big get

1njxrxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/comments/1njxrxk/do_i_let_my_daughter_keep_having_this_girl_over/,"Do I let my daughter keep having this girl over, even though her mom went on an entitled rant and chewed me out over my car battery dying?","Hi all. I posted on ‚Äúentitled parents‚Äù first but realized what I really need is advice. I can‚Äôt decide if I should let me daughter have her friend over again after the mom went on an entitled rant to me over the phone and chewed me out, given that I never want to be in that situation again.

My daughter (11f), I‚Äôll call her ‚ÄúD‚Äù just started 6th grade middle school and has had the same best friend (11f) since 3rd grade, call her ‚ÄúB.‚Äù They are the only ones of their friend group that went on to this middle school. 

B‚Äôs mom has always seemed a bit neurotic and cold, but I‚Äôm probably not everyone‚Äôs cup of tea either so I figured it‚Äôs ok. The girls don‚Äôt see each other much outside school because B lives a distance away and commutes from another district. 

B‚Äôs mom hinted that it‚Äôs hard for her to get B from school and then get B‚Äôs brother from high school which gets out an hour later. She suggested that our daughters hang out together after school and walk to a coffee shop about a mile away, where she would pick them up on the way to get her son, so B wouldn‚Äôt be alone. I live next to the  high school so she‚Äôd drop my daughter off after. It was a considerate offer but I thought the distance was long for them to walk alone, and the coffee shop is right by a major highway which just doesn‚Äôt feel safe for these two little girls alone. So I offered instead to pick them both up and bring them to my house where she could get her daughter when she got her son. She said yes and seemed excited about it. I figured this was a perfect solution and we‚Äôd probably do it the next couple years as the girls are close. I work full time (B‚Äôs mom doesn‚Äôt work) so having something I can do to help made me really happy. 

First day, the battery in my mom-van died. Not because anything was left on, but random old age. My husband offered to get the girls in his car (stick shift which I can‚Äôt drive, too small for me to go along with toddler and have room for everyone). I messaged the mom what happened and that he would be 10-15 late. The original plan was to pick them up ~20 min after the bell to avoid the rush, and my daughter is used to my work schedule and traffic varying so I thought nothing of it. My message included that he would pick up the girls first, then go to the elementary to get my son (8m) before heading home. This woman has known my son for years and where he goes to school since our girls went there too. It‚Äôs 10 min further down the road, so 20 round trip. Add that to the 10-15 for the dead battery and we‚Äôd still be home well before she came for her son.

At first she messages me that it‚Äôs ‚ÄúNot ideal, but ok.‚Äù  I found this weird, but ok. In a second she is calling me, clearly riled, and immediately started laying into me about withholding the information that my son would be picked up after her daughter. Just about every sentence began with ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt APPRECIATE‚Ä¶‚Äù According to her, her daughter should not have to sit in a car an additional 20 minutes to pick up my son. This was apparently ‚Äúnot agreed to‚Äù and had she known she would have arranged a different ‚Äúsocial engagement‚Äù for her daughter. She kept listing all the other things her daughter could have done during that time that would have been more enjoyable then waiting for pickup and driving home with my family. There is no problem with my son, to be clear, it had to do with the time. She kept freakin adding up the minutes for me so I‚Äôd see the enormity of the problem. 

The next thing that rattled her was that her daughter was now getting picked up ‚Äúby a man she doesn‚Äôt know, in a car she doesn‚Äôt know‚Äù and that ‚Äúat the very least‚Äù this ‚Äúwarranted a phone call, not a text message.‚Äù My husband has been attending school events since kindergarten, B knows him whether she‚Äôs talked to him or not, and at the very least D can vouch for the identity of her own step-dad? 

Next she had an issue that I hadn‚Äôt called or texted D. D doesn‚Äôt have a cell phone, by my choice so she won‚Äôt be on it all the time, and this is part of the reason I didn‚Äôt feel it safe to let her walk a mile to a coffee shop. D has an Apple Watch without cell connection. When she‚Äôs home, she can use it to make calls on our home WiFi. This is mainly for safety when I have to run out and she‚Äôs home with her little brothers. B‚Äôs mom challenged me by listing all the people she‚Äôs met who can make calls on an Apple Watch. She couldn‚Äôt frickin accept what I was telling her. Finally she turned it around like I was irresponsible and it would have been a huge disaster if her daughter hadn‚Äôt been there (her daughter has a phone). We‚Äôre talking 10-15 late. Campus stays open. Girls are safe. 

I suggested that the girls were both very mature and knew how to be flexible, and that flexibility was in order for everyone here, given that no one planned for my battery to die. She told me I was calling her ‚Äúinflexible‚Äù and that I was ‚Äúpassive aggressive.‚Äù

The thing she kept repeating to me that really got me is that we were not her only option, that there were lots of other girls who could have walked to the coffee shop with her daughter, but no, she let her daughter come with me, apparently under false pretenses. 

I explained that I didn‚Äôt think picking up my son was a big deal, that it was about the girls spending time together as best friends (they both wanted this) and that I had hoped I‚Äôd be helping her out by bringing her daughter to a location that was so convenient for her pickup. She took this very badly, ‚ÄúYou helping me? Excuse me. I did not ASK for your help. I did not WANT your help!‚Äù 

She went on about 10 minutes before I excused myself to call my husband, all rattled, and see if there was some other way we could get my son home from school, which we were able to arrange. While I was on the phone with him she apparently thought of more things she wanted to say, because she called me back and laid into me for another 10 min! I‚Äôm not a pushover but I was very caught off guard by this behavior and had to keep my head from spinning so I wouldn‚Äôt say something to ruin my daughter‚Äôs friendship. I stayed respectful to her, though I didn‚Äôt like it.

When the girls arrived, I texted B‚Äôs mom as soon as I saw them pulling into the driveway. They were fine. Didn‚Äôt mind the ride at all, just happy kids. Then B‚Äôs mom called her. B answered and her face fell. I couldn‚Äôt hear what mom was saying but B just kept saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry mom. I‚Äôm sorry mom. I‚Äôm sorry mom.‚Äù Over and over‚Ä¶ Couldn‚Äôt imagine what for as this wasn‚Äôt B‚Äôs fault. Turns out my text put mom on alert that B had gotten here. It took them a couple minutes to get their stuff inside which was too much for mom. B was supposed to call her immediately upon arrival. 

When B‚Äôs mom picked her up she acted syrupy sweet like nothing was wrong. It felt very weird. Then I got a message that she was so sorry that there seemed to have been a ‚Äúmiscommunication‚Äù between us. This is not an apology, to me, as it was not a miscommunication but her being rude. Also during the conversation she kept using the word ‚Äúmiscommunication‚Äù with a lot a sarcasm, which made her text seem sarcastic as well. I haven‚Äôt responded. 

This situation is not B‚Äôs fault and I have no problem with her coming over but I really do not want to deal with her mom again. I don‚Äôt want to put myself through that. I don‚Äôt want to be yelled at or talked down to. I don‚Äôt want to be on edge in case some minor circumstance is not to her liking. I‚Äôm inclined to just let the girls see each other at school like they always have before and wait until the girls are driving for them to arrange their own play dates. Yet on the other hand, I don‚Äôt want to isolate this little girl who is not at fault. Sometimes, to be fair, she acts high strung and bossy, like her mom. But when I saw that phone call and heard her saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù it just broke my heart. Happy normal kids don‚Äôt fall over themselves apologizing when they did nothing wrong. I fear that her life in that house may be hell. But then, sometimes the daughter acts like the mom (modeling, I know) which is bothersome but also shows she could use some better influences.

I‚Äôve noticed a few other things in the past that concerned me and make me worry that this is a narcissistic mom who over-controls her daughter. At a school function I was talking to B‚Äôs mom and B ran up to show her a project. B‚Äôs mom looked disgusted and eyed her up and down then told her her shorts don‚Äôt fit. Girl looked so sad and embarrassed. Also, despite being 11 year old 6th graders, B‚Äôs mom depending on her mood might make B ride in a booster seat. She made me bring one with us to the mall. B doesn‚Äôt have any medical problems to require the booster, btw, she‚Äôs just normal petite. This seems embarrassing and controlling for a girl her age, as does the mom‚Äôs over-involvement in her social calendar and advocating on her behalf for stuff B doesn‚Äôt care about.  There may be some jealousy going on as they are very competitive and my daughter knows a lot more people at school than B (to my daughter this is not a competition, but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it is to them).

For one more piece of context on the mom, when I told my daughter later what had happened, she 1) mentioned that B‚Äôs mother had instructed her pretty directly that she had to sit with B at lunch in middle school and that this was weird. 2) that B doesn‚Äôt have any other close friends to walk after school with, so it seemed fake and competitive that me mom acted like she did; 3) the mom has disliked me since she first met me when the girls were in 3rd grade and we first met. Reason being that she came up to me and told me our girls were tight, and I asked who her daughter was (she thought I should have already known).

TLDR; this mom went off on me after I picked up her daughter from school, and I can‚Äôt decide whether to let my daughter have the girl to our house again if I have to interact with the mom. ",3,1758166238.0,WhatShouldIDo,3,1.0,False

1njxqga,https://www.reddit.com/r/PregnancyUK/comments/1njxqga/did_you_stop_drinking_coffee_the_months_before/,Did you stop drinking coffee the months before trying to conceive / before getting your positive test?,"I was wondering if any of you stopped or decreased your coffee consumption BEFORE trying to conceive? I know you are supposed to take no more than 200 mg of caffeine per day while pregnant or TTC but of course the less you take, the better. Also regarding fertility, some sources say it‚Äôs better to limit caffeine consumption 1 year before TTC which sounds like a lot. 
I‚Äôm not a coffee addict or anything I just take 1 small cup of cappuccino 3 times a week, sometimes 4 a week especially when I‚Äôm tired from house chores and taking care of my baby, never more than 1 a day.
I read that drinking less coffee is better for your fertility, so for my first time getting pregnant I completely stopped drinking coffee or soda 2 months before conceiving and I got pregnant on the first try naturally but it was so hard because I cut caffeine cold turkey and I didn‚Äôt have withdrawal effects but my body was missing the energy!
Of course other factors play a role like your age and overall health to get pregnant. 

Did anyone just kept drinking coffee or sodas with caffeine before conceiving and got a positive pregnancy test the first time trying? I want to know if it really seems to affect fertility or it depends on each person. Thanks! ",1,1758166112.0,PregnancyUK,3,1.0,False

1njxpte,https://www.reddit.com/r/ruggedhead/comments/1njxpte/entrepreneurial_isolation_your_not_alone_and_how/,Entrepreneurial Isolation: Your Not Alone and How to Build a Peer Support System,"I see a lot of posts here about the ""lonely at the top"" feeling. The long hours, the constant decision-making, the pressure to always have the answers- it can feel like you‚Äôre on an island every waking moment. It‚Äôs a silent struggle that more of us face than you‚Äôd think. A survey by Inc. magazine found that 50% of CEOs report feeling lonely in their role, and 61% believe it hurts their performance. If you feel like no one ""gets it,"" you're in the majority.

So, why is this isolation so common?

* **The Burden of the Boss:** Unlike an employee, you can't always vent to your team or even your family about the deep-seated fears and uncertainties. You're the one everyone looks to for confidence, which can make you feel like you have to shield others from the hard realities.
* **Relentless Drive:** We're wired differently. We have an obsession to solve a problem and a vision that not everyone can see. This often means working when others are socializing or resting, which naturally creates distance.

But here‚Äôs the thing: You don‚Äôt have to do it alone. The solution isn't to stop being an entrepreneur- it's to build a support system with people who truly get it.

**Communities that can help:**

* **Online Platforms:** Communities like Reddit, Indie Hackers, RuggedHead  and Startup Grind can be hidden gems. They offer a place to share your journey, ask questions and celebrate wins with people on a similar path. The transparency is often incredible, and you can connect with people building everything from small bootstrapped businesses to venture-backed startups.
* **Mastermind Groups:** This is my personal favorite. A mastermind is a small group of peers who meet regularly to discuss goals, brainstorm solutions and hold each other accountable. It‚Äôs a confidential space where you can be brutally honest about your struggles and get unfiltered feedback from people who are just as invested in your success as their own.
* **Formal Organizations:** Groups like the Entrepreneurs' Organization (EO) offer highly structured peer-to-peer networks. They often entail a significant investment, but also¬† provide a deeper level of support and learning opportunities with fellow business owners that you may not find otherwise.

**How to build your own circle of trust:** You don't need a fancy group or a big network to get started. You can build your own small, potent circle.

* **Start with one or two people.** Think about a business owner you admire or someone you've met at a conference who seems relatable. Reach out and simply suggest a bi-weekly virtual coffee chat. The key is to find people who are at a similar stage in their journey. Yes, it can be awkward at first but pay big dividends later on.
* **Look for honesty, not cheerleading.** A good support circle provides tough love. You want people who will give you brutally honest feedback, not just pat you on the back. It's about finding people who will ask, ""Mark, does this idea actually work?"" as one source described, rather than just saying ""yes"" to everything.
* **Make it a two-way street.** A circle of trust is built on mutual support. Be as willing to give advice, share your own struggles and celebrate their wins as you are to receive their support.

Entrepreneurial isolation is not a badge of honor. Resilience is not found in solitude, but in connection. Build your circle. Find your mastermind. Explore resilience-focused platforms to see what works for others. In doing so, you won‚Äôt just strengthen your business- you‚Äôll protect your most vital asset: mindset.

So if you still want me based on those pictures, just simply DM me. If you don't, then don't bother sending me a DM anymore since we'll end up just wasting both of our time since I might not even be your type. So please, don't bother. Don't worry, I will NOT be asking you for nude photos or videos and please don't ask me for those as well. I personally think ""Spark"" is important in any relationships and it's better if we're both attracted to each other physically FIRST before anything else, then we can go from there. Also, do not worry, I will NOT ghost you or abandon you out of nowhere. A real man MUST ALWAYS be honest and upfront, so expect me to be honest with you rather than leaving you hanging and I expect you to do the same. This is to filter out scammers and frauds out there. I want you and me to be safe and I want us both to enjoy this experience. So safety first!

‚ÄãI was recently having a coffee with a client who had a frustrating experience with their previous broker. The broker released $150k in equity for them to buy an investment property‚Äîwhich sounds great, right?

‚ÄãThe problem is, they released the equity without simultaneously refinancing the client's existing owner-occupied loan, leaving it with a high rate of 5.80% (when many lenders are under 5.50%).

‚ÄãBut here's the kicker: The broker never even bothered to check if the client could afford the new investment property loan in the first place!

‚ÄãThis is a classic rookie mistake. All lending for both the equity release and the future purchase must be qualified before any application is submitted. This oversight wasted everyone's time and, more importantly, let the client down.

‚ÄãIf you're looking to release equity to fund an investment property, it's a two-step process that requires an experienced hand. Make sure you ask your broker if they have a proven track record with investors. You'd be surprised how many don't.

She recently joined a new gym and met a guy there who's 10 years older. They are just friends and chat casually whenever they see each other. I've met him at the gym too a couple times and he seems pretty nice, he came up to me first saying I had good form and stuff.

When we were chatting, my gf's history of playing drums came up and the guy suggested booking a studio to jam. I was in that conversation circle but he didn't mention anything that would suggest me being there. I even said something like ""haha I'll bring my triangle"" and he just laughed, which is understandable I guess, because it was a joke. During the conversation, he said things to my gf like ""you need to learn how to be loud when playing"" and ""I'm really loud"". This could be simply referring to drumming but idk it felt weird to me because of the way he looked at her when he said it. To be fair he is quite an eccentric guy. 

Fast forward a few weeks my gf tells me this guy booked a studio, and if I'm free to join. I said yeah I should be if I don't need to work last minute. I asked if the guy mentioned me when he invited her. She said no he didn't but he probably knows I'm coming. I said it's kinda weird that he invited you without mentioning me at all. My gf lacks some social awareness sometimes, or maybe I am just being too suspicious of the situation. 

Anyways now I need to work last minute on an important job. The studio is still booked, my gf would feel bad cancelling on her new friend and things might be awkward because they see each other at the gym often. I get it, he paid for the session and cancelling isn't nice especially when she is free.

The thing is we've only known this guy for a month and while he does seem like a nice guy, I think nice guys sometimes also have not so nice intentions. I just don't really know him well enough yet to be comfortable with them 2 being alone together in a soundproof studio.

My gf tends to be very trusting of people. She's not attracted to him but he is single. I'm worried for her safety because he is a gym bro and could easily overpower her. If it was just meeting for food or coffee in public then yeah that's allgood but in this situation, hypothetically speaking if he were to spike her drink or literally do anything suss, no one would hear them. I don't know if there are cameras in the room but from the sounds of it he knows the studio guys so..

Maybe I'm overthinking this, or maybe not, AITA for telling her she needs to cancel?",3,1758165485.0,AITAH,4,0.8,False

After a really bad year of uti's, and then yeast infection, my resusults at the beginning of July started comimg back negative for everything but I felt the same as when I had the infection. I didnt have access to privet healthcare and the GP gave me over the phone yeast infection cream. Around the same period, my grandmother died and I had also some other personal issues that made me really upset, and also doing my dissertation, and all these made it worse. I finally was told by a gynecologist that I have atopic vulvar dermatitis, changed all me eating habits, but after two monts i feel even worse. 

My gynecologist today told me it never goes away, and I feel like I want to die, and refuse to accept it. Everything I read on the internet is usually older women and I am only 25, and I feel my life is over. I cannot sleep at night because of irritation and the consntant feeling that I have to pee. I took sleeping pills for many nights, but cannot continue taking them for long periods of time. I dont have itching, but burning of the vulva, redness, frequent need to pee. I had sex during summer a few times, but the next days I was wite down there or red and swollen, and could not leave the house. 

I am looking for people with same problems around my age (25-26), so I can feel less alone. I dont think there are more things to try, I do the classics, barrier cream, no toilet paper only washing, ect. However I havent quit smoking (I started after I got this because of the stress and sadness). Is it really that bad for vulvar dermatitis, or its just a recomendation? I already cut out coffee, alcahool, sweets, acidic, spicy carbs (and eggs someone told me). Also, do you excersise? My mental health is really bad, but I am afraid to excersise because of sweat. Is it better if for the next six months I just lay in bed?

  
Also, how do you deal with your social life? The guy that we were serious with for a year was supportive but told me that if it never goes away im on my own, and it hit me hard because I cant blame him. I feel like I am going to die alone. Is there someone with a similar story?

Vomiting in dogs can happen for many reasons‚Äîsome minor and others more serious. That‚Äôs why having a **vet-approved dog vomit guide** can help you understand what‚Äôs normal, what‚Äôs not, and when it‚Äôs time to call your veterinarian.

This article breaks down the **causes of dog vomit, what different colours may indicate, and how Lyka‚Äôs dog vomit colour chart** can make it easier for pet parents to act quickly.

# Why Do Dogs Vomit?

Vomiting is a natural reflex that helps dogs get rid of something their bodies don‚Äôt agree with. Some common causes include:

* **Dietary indiscretion** ‚Äì eating too quickly, eating grass, or scavenging food scraps.
* **Food allergies or intolerances** ‚Äì reactions to certain ingredients in dog food.
* **Infections** ‚Äì bacterial or viral illnesses.
* **Parasites** ‚Äì worms and other intestinal parasites.
* **Toxins** ‚Äì ingesting harmful substances like chocolate, grapes, or medications.
* **Underlying health issues** ‚Äì kidney disease, liver disease, pancreatitis, or gastrointestinal blockages.

# Lyka‚Äôs Dog Vomit Colour Guide

The colour and texture of vomit can provide important clues about your dog‚Äôs health. Lyka‚Äôs **vet-approved dog vomit colour chart** helps you identify what the vomit might mean.

# 1. Yellow Vomit

* Usually, bile, often seen when a dog‚Äôs stomach is empty.
* Can indicate acid buildup, mild stomach upset, or early morning ‚Äúhunger pukes.‚Äù

# 2. White or Foamy Vomit

* Often linked to gastric reflux or indigestion.
* It may also appear after drinking water too quickly.

# 3. Green Vomit

* Could be bile or ingested grass.
* Persistent green vomit may indicate gallbladder or liver issues.

# 4. Brown Vomit

* It may be due to food or ingested dirt.
* Dark brown, coffee-ground-like vomit may indicate **digested blood**‚Äîseek veterinary care immediately.

# 5. Red Vomit

* Fresh blood in vomit is always a serious concern.
* Could signal ulcers, poisoning, or injury in the digestive tract.

# 6. Clear Vomit

* Usually saliva, water, or gastric juices.
* It can happen if your dog is drooling excessively before vomiting.

# When to See a Vet

Not all vomiting requires an emergency visit, but it‚Äôs important to know when to act fast. Contact your veterinarian if your dog:

* Vomits repeatedly in a short period.
* Shows blood or dark brown material in vomit.
* Refuses food or water for more than 24 hours.
* Has diarrhea, lethargy, or fever alongside vomiting.
* Is it a puppy, a senior dog, or does it have pre-existing health conditions?

# How to Help Your Dog at Home

* Offer small sips of water to prevent dehydration.
* Withhold food for a few hours, then reintroduce a bland diet (boiled chicken and rice) if advised by your vet.
* Keep toxic foods and household items out of reach.
* Stick to a consistent, vet-approved diet like **Lyka‚Äôs fresh, whole food meals** to reduce stomach upsets.

# Final Thoughts

Dog vomit can be alarming, but understanding the colour, frequency, and context can help you respond appropriately. **Lyka‚Äôs vet-approved dog vomit guide and colour charts** give pet parents a simple, practical way to assess their dog‚Äôs health and take timely action.

üëâ Remember: If in doubt, always consult your veterinarian. Early detection and treatment can make a huge difference in your dog‚Äôs recovery and well-being.",1,1758165183.0,u_MillerTissa,0,1.0,False

I am an English guy 

Any women from the USA or Canada please message me I want to hear from you I love your accents 

If you leave any rude or critical comments ln this post you will be blocked 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I‚Äôm really not interested I don‚Äôt know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I‚Äôm now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I‚Äôve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I‚Äôve never really dated and I‚Äôve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I‚Äôd like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You‚Äôll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I‚Äôm generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don‚Äôt have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don‚Äôt like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face¬† I am not that type of guy. I also don‚Äôt like those that think it‚Äôs okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.¬† 

I am not one that is into partying I don‚Äôt like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I‚Äôm not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going¬† to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I‚Äôm very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I‚Äôve never been tempted by anyone and I‚Äôd never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don‚Äôt view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I‚Äôd have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I‚Äôve never been on loads of dates I‚Äôm not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that‚Äôs it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don‚Äôt want to use the actual word for it and I don‚Äôt smoke I don‚Äôt drink heavily and I‚Äôve never touched any illegal drugs. I‚Äôve got no bad addictions or bad habits I‚Äôve lived a very clean life. 

I‚Äôm not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I‚Äôm in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I‚Äôve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I‚Äôd love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking¬† often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I‚Äôm not bad at it and I‚Äôd again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I‚Äôve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it‚Äôs not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don‚Äôt just want to settle I‚Äôve never just wanted to settle I‚Äôm seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I‚Äôd never have an affair or a fling and I‚Äôm not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone I loved and cared about 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it‚Äôs an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I‚Äôve been to and we have the lovely √Æle de re island nearby I have been there many times it‚Äôs also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it‚Äôs certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it‚Äôs amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I‚Äôm very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don‚Äôt know. I also love soft rock some of the bands¬† love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I‚Äôve seen most of my favourite bands live too I‚Äôve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she‚Äôs a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she‚Äôs absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it‚Äôs my favourite but I only have it in moderation I‚Äôve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don‚Äôt drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don‚Äôt drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can‚Äôt ever see myself going either way.¬† 

It‚Äôs very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don‚Äôt drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I‚Äôm not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I‚Äôm not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I‚Äôve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I‚Äôm not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won‚Äôt be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don‚Äôt fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I‚Äôm very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I‚Äôm in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I‚Äôm always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don‚Äôt aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don‚Äôt watch reality tv. I don‚Äôt watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it‚Äôs how I‚Äôve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I‚Äôd never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don‚Äôt wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I‚Äôd prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don‚Äôt wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women

1njx7q2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AI_Agents/comments/1njx7q2/week_5_can_ancher_ever_be_jarvis_the_real_way_to/,[Week 5] Can Ancher Ever Be Jarvis? The Real Way to Make AI Feel Smart,"In the last post, I talked about the challenges of intent recognition and how we approached complex scenarios. Today I want to take a step back and ask a bigger question: **could Ancher ever become something like Jarvis?**

Let‚Äôs be honest: for a long time, no AI assistant is going to reach the level of intelligence we see in the movies. Not only because of our own technical limits, but because the entire industry is nowhere near that point yet. Maybe some military research lab has something more advanced, but for us in the open, the gap is huge.

So the real question becomes: *from a product design perspective, how do you create the feeling of intelligence?*

This is where I go back to my strength: product design. I‚Äôm not the best engineer, but I am a creative product thinker. From a psychology angle, people often understand new things by comparing them to something they already know. If we want users to perceive ‚Äúintelligence,‚Äù we should anchor it to a familiar real-world role or scenario.

After a lot of discussion, I landed on the idea of projecting *Ancher* as something like a **personal assistant, secretary, or private butler**. These roles are highly customized and deeply personal ‚Äî a good metaphor for what we want *Ancher* to feel like.

The next step was to design a concrete scenario where this ‚Äúintelligence‚Äù could be experienced. We picked one very simple but powerful use case: **‚Äúwatch this for me.‚Äù**

Why this one? Because it‚Äôs common, frequent, and genuinely useful.

Let‚Äôs simulate: imagine you‚Äôre following a new technology field. Searching for updates every day is tedious and time-consuming. With a personal assistant, you‚Äôd just ask them to track it for you, summarize the progress, and report back in your preferred format. That‚Äôs exactly what *Ancher* could do.

Or, take daily life examples: travel policy updates, tax procedure changes, sports team news. These are all things that matter, but are easy to forget and painful to track. If *Ancher* can ‚Äúwatch this for me‚Äù ‚Äî monitor updates, compare changes, and report progress ‚Äî then the sense of intelligence becomes tangible.

And if you don‚Äôt like the details of the report, you can fine-tune it by chatting with *Ancher*, shaping the updates until they match your habits.

When this idea clicked, I was honestly excited. I even gave it a tagline:

**‚ÄúAncher.ai ‚Äî your personal Chief Information Officer. Experience presidential service.‚Äù**

With automation, you save huge amounts of time. All you do is read the updates, make small adjustments, and your information ecosystem stays current ‚Äî built just for you.

Right now, the experience is limited to smartphones and computers. But in the next five years, as new devices, new interaction methods, and IoT integration spread, I can imagine *Ancher* being accessible anytime, anywhere.

Here‚Äôs a fun example: I follow a football team closely. *Ancher* could track everything for me ‚Äî official news, player transfers, match stats, even locker-room rumors. Instead of digging through different sources, I‚Äôd just grab a coffee and read *Ancher*‚Äôs daily digest, knowing I‚Äôve got a complete picture.

To me, good products aren‚Äôt about chasing grand visions. They solve small, real, everyday problems, making life easier and cheaper. That‚Äôs how human progress happens ‚Äî in practical steps.

Every product designer has, at some level, the dream of changing the world.

1njx4yd,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1njx4yd/ms_sixty_seconds/,[MS] Sixty Seconds,"Every day this happens. It has happened for decades and for some reason, one person keeps moving while time stands still for everyone else. Every action in that frozen minute can ripple for years. Today, it seems I was the chosen one. Right in the middle of my work shift, too. This is the fourth bank in the area to be hit by the crew of bank robbers in the last 3 weeks. Of all the tellers, he chose me. As soon as he raised the gun, I put my hands up in the air, ready to comply with the requests- ""Get your hands where I can see 'em! Don't try to be a hero-- Open the safe. No silent alarms. No tracker in the bag. Fill it with the money. Big bills.""- when everything froze. Except me. I stared at the masked assailant, arms raised, weighing my next move. Disarm him? Unmask him? Restrain him? ""Don't be a hero..."" those words continue to echo in my head. I never was ‚Äúthe hero‚Äù.¬†¬†

¬†

I was supposed to be the 4th generation of Police Officers, but I am haunted by the memory from my childhood. The faint scent of burnt coffee hits me‚ÄîI‚Äôm 12 again. It‚Äôs not a happy memory; it‚Äôs one I wish I never experienced. It‚Äôs the day that changed everything.

¬†I walked into the bodega by my house on the way home from school to buy an ice cream. I walked past Mr. Riviera, who gave me the friendly smile ""hola, mijo"" he called out as I walked to the back where the ice cooler was. And that's when I heard it-- ""Hands up! Empty the register! QUICK! No funny business old man!""- I heard the ding of the register, some shuffling, I crouched down to not be seen or heard, I had a clear view of Mr. Riviera, but they couldn't see me. When suddenly, everything froze. When time was no longer frozen, Mr. Riviera was no longer behind the counter, rather he was in front of it, about to take the gun from the robber. ""BANG! BANG!"" and Mr. Riviera hit the ground with a thud. I watched the blood pool around his body. Within minutes my father and his partner came rushing in. The robber was gone, and so was Mr. Riviera. I watched as Dad and his partner, Dino, did CPR. And in that moment, I knew I wasn't cut out to be a cop. I was only 12 but I still knew this wasn't the life for me.

¬†

So, I chose something safe. Something I shouldn't get shot doing. Being a bank teller. My dad was furious when I chose a teller's desk at Chase over the Police Academy. Four years in college, a Criminal Justice degree‚Äîand my family still thinks I‚Äôm wasting my life.

¬†

I'm 23, I have plenty of time to make a difference in this world, to be somebody. Somebody worthy of approval and pride. And that's when it clicked... I need to be like Mr. Riviera. I need to stop this guy before he hurts someone, or me.¬†

¬†

I reached across the counter and grabbed the gun and replaced it with an empty notepad. I placed a piece of tape on the silent alarm button to make sure it goes off as soon as the seconds are up.

25 seconds remain in the time freeze. Those 60 seconds move so much faster when you are trying to save lives-- the world is quieter, a slight hum of the electric from the lightbulbs above me-- is it always this bright here? The quickening ""thump, thump"" inside of my chest, feeling like it's ready to leap out... or cower like I should be. Dust floating, suspended in air, almost as if the air is so thick you could slice it up and serve it on a plate.

I tucked the gun- a 9mm- into my waistband. I'm not taking any chances. Or was this the biggest gamble? What if he still kills me anyway or what if an innocent person gets hurt because of me?

¬†

Quick, Daniel, think... 10 seconds left... I got it!

I yank the mask away.

My brain races to catch up.

Mr. Riviera‚Äôs son.

Blood on the bodega floor.

He was trying to save me.

I'm looking for something close enough to walk most places, but not that interested in Bourbon street activities etc. I'd love to be close to good breakfast/dinner options, although those are probably everywhere. I absolutely will be checking out Frenchman St, jazz is my favorite music (and I used to play)as a priority. I will also be interested in a tour or two to maybe Whitney Plantation, for example. I also LOVE TREES so I'm thinking more of the east (?) side of the FQ/Marigny area. I would love to ride the streetcar to see southern mansions, recs appreciated there too. 

My options are: Jean Lafitte, Lamonthe, Rathbone, Melrose Mansion, French Quarter Lanaux-- farther SW are Chateau Hotel and Hotel Royal New Orleans. Melrose is stretching it, the Lanaux is probably out of budget, but does look nice. I really like Hotel Provincial too but it‚Äôs booked solid, sad. Those aren't exactly in the same area but still probably out of the major noise. 

Any recs from people who've stayed? It the Rathbone Mansion too far? Also, I really really really prefer a coffee machine in the room, and a mini fridge would be nice but not a deal breaker. 

TL;DR- help me pick a hotel out of the noise of Bourbon but still close to walk and that's relatively 'safe' for a solo.

1njx1mx,https://i.redd.it/3amihqe68upf1.png,How Much Space Do You Need for a 1000-Piece Puzzle?,"If you‚Äôre planning to tackle a 1000-piece puzzle, one of the first questions that comes up is: **how much space do I actually need?**

On average, a standard 1000-piece puzzle measures around **20 x 27 inches (50 x 70 cm)** when completed. That means you‚Äôll need a surface slightly larger than that ‚Äî ideally at least **24 x 32 inches (60 x 80 cm)** ‚Äî so you have extra room for sorting and moving pieces around.

üí° **Tips for setting up your puzzle space:**

1. **Choose the right table.** A dining or dedicated puzzle table works best. Coffee tables can be tricky since they‚Äôre often too small.
2. **Leave sorting space.** Trays or extra boards for sorting by color/edges will save you a lot of time.
3. **Think about lighting.** A well-lit area reduces eye strain and helps distinguish similar shades.
4. **Avoid high-traffic zones.** Pets, kids, or even accidental bumps can undo hours of work.
5. **Consider portability.** Puzzle mats and foldable boards are great if you don‚Äôt have a permanent space.

So while you technically just need the puzzle‚Äôs finished size, in practice, you‚Äôll be much happier with **a little extra breathing room** around it.

üëâ Where do you usually set up your 1000-piece puzzles? Do you use the dining table, a special puzzle board, or something more creative?",1,1758163987.0,OnlinePuzzleLovers,0,1.0,False

The¬†**murder of Jaclyn Marie Dowaliby**¬†is an unsolved¬†[child murder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_murder)¬†which occurred in¬†[Midlothian, Illinois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midlothian,_Illinois), on September 10, 1988, when a seven-year-old girl was¬†[abducted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abduction)¬†from her bedroom and¬†[murdered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_(United_States_law))¬†by an unknown individual or individuals. Her¬†[strangled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligature_strangulation)¬†body was discovered in a section of wasteland in¬†[Blue Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Island,_Illinois)¬†four days later.

Dowaliby's mother and stepfather were tried for her murder in 1990; her mother was acquitted, although her adoptive father, David Dowaliby, was convicted of her murder and sentenced to 45 years' imprisonment.¬†His conviction was later overturned, and he was released from prison in November 1991. The case remains unsolved, and has been described as one of¬†[Metropolitan Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_metropolitan_area)'s most infamous¬†[cold cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_case).

**Early life**

Jaclyn Dowaliby was born on May 17, 1981 in¬†[Chicago, Illinois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago,_Illinois), the first and only child born to James ""Jimmy"" and Cynthia Guess. The couple had met in the 1970s at a skating rink where Jaclyn's father worked when her mother was a teenager and her father in his early 20s; the two began a relationship which lasted for seven years but mutually separated shortly before Jaclyn's birth. Shortly thereafter, Jaclyn's parents engaged in a bitter feud over¬†[custody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_custody)¬†of her, which Cynthia ultimately won.

In approximately 1982, Jaclyn's mother became acquainted with David Dowaliby, whom she married when her daughter was two years old. Six months after their wedding, David Dowaliby legally adopted Jaclyn, who viewed Dowaliby as her father and‚Äîhaving never seen her father since infancy‚Äîreportedly believed him to be so. One year later, in 1984, her half-brother, David Jr., was born. The family were observed to be loving and close-knit, with one neighbor recollecting: ""They were a loving family; they were always hugging their kids¬†... they never yelled at them. They never even spanked them; they'd send them to their rooms or take away their bikes. They didn't believe in¬†[corporal punishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporal_punishment).""

Jaclyn has been described as a happy, ""bubbly"" and content child who enjoyed playing with dolls and was popular among her peers at Central Park Elementary School.¬†Her mother worked within the dietary department at¬†[Oak Forest Hospital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Forest_Hospital_of_Cook_County), and her stepfather as a construction foreman at Rax Erecting Service.

By 1988, the family resided in a one-story ranch-style home on 148th Street in a¬†[middle-class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-class)¬†section of Midlothian, Illinois, surrounded by several¬†[nature reserves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_reserves).¬†The house was owned by David Dowaliby's mother, Anna, who also resided at the residence and who slept in a basement bedroom.¬†That summer, Cynthia discovered she was pregnant with her third child.

**September 9‚Äì10, 1988**

On the afternoon of September 9, 1988, Cynthia took her two children to a local¬†[Kentucky Fried Chicken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Fried_Chicken)¬†for dinner while her husband visited a¬†[Blue Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Island,_Illinois)¬†bowling alley with some friends. He returned home at 9:20¬†p.m. to observe his wife and children at home with two family members, who both left the household shortly thereafter.

At 10:30¬†p.m. that evening, Jaclyn‚Äîthen seven years old‚Äîdressed in her nightgown and kissed her mother goodnight before climbing into her bed with a¬†[Sears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sears)¬†catalog, which she began reading.¬†Her stepfather retired to bed at approximately the same time.

At approximately 11¬†p.m., Jaclyn's mother checked on her daughter, only to observe her sound asleep in her bed; Cynthia switched off the light in her daughter's bedroom and went to sleep herself, leaving both her children's bedroom doors slightly ajar. Both parents remained adamant they slept soundly throughout the night and heard nothing untoward.

**Abduction**

At 8¬†a.m. on September 10, David Dowaliby awoke. According to statements given to police, he was surprised not to observe Jaclyn already awake and watching cartoons in the living room. Upon checking her bedroom, David noted the child was neither asleep or playing with toys upon her bedroom floor, although he did observe an open suitcase‚Äîwhich Jaclyn occasionally played with‚Äîlying on her bed and her dresser drawers open, with items of her clothing in disarray. With the exception of the child's blanket, nothing was missing from her bedroom.

Initially, David assumed Jaclyn may be playing outside with a friend and sat to watch cartoons with his son. One hour later, he woke Cynthia by bringing her a cup of coffee and remarked his belief Jaclyn was playing outside; Cynthia rapidly became alarmed at her daughter's absence.

A search of the house revealed no trace of Jaclyn, although the Dowalibys did note the kitchen door to their property‚Äîtypically locked at nights‚Äîwas slightly ajar. After briefly checking at a neighbor's home to inquire if Jaclyn was playing with a friend, David and Cynthia Dowaliby returned to their home only to observe en route that the¬†[screen door](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_door)¬†to a basement window had been cut or torn open and the window itself had been smashed, through which an individual had evidently unlatched the window as a potential point of entry to the property.¬†The Dowalibys then reported their daughter as¬†[missing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_person)¬†to the Midlothian Police Department.

**Investigation**

Midlothian Police immediately launched an intense search to locate the child. This extensive search of local terrain involved the usage of all-terrain vehicles and¬†[search and rescue dogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_and_rescue_dogs).¬†Officers were assisted in their search of areas of interest by local firefighters and numerous civilian volunteers, and an¬†[underwater search and recovery unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwater_search_and_recovery)¬†would¬†[dredge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dredging)¬†a swamp located a block from the Dowaliby household.¬†The¬†[U.S. Coast Guard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Coast_Guard)¬†also conducted an aerial search for the child, to no avail.¬†In addition, numerous missing persons flyers were distributed throughout¬†[Cook County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_County,_Illinois)¬†and friends and neighbors of the family tied numerous yellow ribbons to oak trees upon the streets surrounding the Dowaliby household in symbolic gestures of hope and¬†[solidarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity).

A¬†[forensic examination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_science)¬†of the house itself yielded few clues, although an examination of the broken basement window revealed an even layer of dust on the windowsill inside the home and no recently deposited hairs or¬†[fibers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber)¬†upon this surface,¬†indicating the intruder or intruders had not entered the premises via this method; however, a smudge described as being an ""indeterminate mark on the wall"" was discovered directly beneath this window.¬†Both this smudge and other smear marks noted upon the front door to the property were unsuitable to enable the lifting of fingerprints.

Beyond the damaged window, the child's missing blanket and mild disarray in her bedroom‚Äîlocated directly opposite her parents' room‚Äîthe house bore few signs of a forced entry, although a forensic examination of Jaclyn's pillow did reveal a human hair described in police reports as originating from a¬†[Negroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negroid)¬†individual.¬†The parents were both adamant that they had heard nothing untoward the evening prior, and questioning of neighbors revealed they too had seen and heard nothing untoward in the early hours of September 10.¬†The broken basement window was located far from Jaclyn's bedroom, and any kidnapper entering via this method would evidently have to then walk up the stairs and down a hallway with markedly squeaky floorboards to enter the child's bedroom. These factors led investigators to believe the perpetrator may have been familiar with the layout of the household.

**Initial theories**

As Jaclyn's biological father is known to have once attempted to break into the Dowaliby household to kidnap his daughter following his failure to secure custody of her, James Guess became a prime suspect in her abduction; however, police soon discounted him as a suspect upon learning he had been imprisoned in¬†[Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida)¬†since May 23, having been sentenced to seven years' imprisonment upon two counts of¬†[sexual battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(crime)#United_States), one count of threatening another with a deadly weapon, and one count of attempted sexual battery.

Initially, a police spokesman confirmed the likelihood Jaclyn had been the victim of a¬†[kidnapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping), with her abductor or abductors most likely leaving the house with the child via the kitchen door,¬†although authorities stated they maintained an¬†[open mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-mindedness)¬†as to the actual¬†[motive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motive_(law))¬†behind her disappearance;¬†however, as no ransom demands were made, the day after Jaclyn's abduction, state and local authorities requested the¬†[FBI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI)¬†become involved in the manhunt to locate the child.

In the days immediately following their daughter's abduction, the Dowalibys willingly submitted to any police requests to assist in their ongoing investigation. On September 13, David Dowaliby was asked to undergo a¬†[polygraph test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygraph_test), to which he agreed. The polygraph test was conducted in Chicago, and according to David, he was informed by the FBI that the examination indicated the truthfulness of his answers.

**Discovery**

At approximately 5:45¬†p.m. on September 14, 1988, a man named Michael Chatman¬†discovered Jaclyn's body discarded upon a section of wasteland close to a garbage receptacle serving a small apartment complex named the Islander Apartments within the city of Blue Island, approximately 6¬†mi (9.7¬†km) from her home. The body lay in a section of¬†[brush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrubland) at the edge of a small wooded area overlooking the¬†[Calumet River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calumet_River).¬†Chatman would later state that upon parking his vehicle, he had become suspicious of a putrid odor and, upon investigation, noted a head and arm protruding from a purple and white blanket which concealed her entire body beneath the upper torso. The body was transported to the¬†[Cook County Medical Examiner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_County_Medical_Examiner)'s office, and was formally identified via¬†[dental records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_dentistry)¬†the following day.

An¬†[autopsy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy)¬†conducted by Dr. Robert Stein revealed Jaclyn had been strangled with a two-foot section of¬†[twine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twine)¬†which was still knotted around her neck.¬†Her body was dressed in her purple nightgown, although her underwear had been removed and discarded close to her body.¬†Both weathering and maggot¬†[predation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation)¬†prevented a detailed forensic examination of the child's clothing,¬†although a single hair of¬†[Caucasian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race)¬†origin was discovered inside her underwear and a single hair sourcing from a Negroid individual was discovered upon the section of twine around the child's neck.¬†Furthermore, her fingernails bore traces of¬†[type O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABO_blood_group_system)¬†blood; this blood type was shared by Jaclyn and all her immediate family with the exception of David Sr., whose blood type was type A.

Due to the extensive decomposition of Jaclyn's body, Dr. Stein was unable to determine if the child had been subjected to a¬†[sexual assault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault)¬†prior to or after her death, although he was unable to discount the possibility. Furthermore, the advanced decomposition and maggot infestation of her remains led Stein to estimate that Jaclyn had most likely been murdered sometime in the morning of September 10.

**Further inquiries**

Prior to the discovery of Jaclyn's body, and after eliminating her biological father as a suspect, investigators had pursued two leads of investigation: that the child had been kidnapped in a non-family abduction; or that one or both of her parents had been responsible. The fact that the dust upon the basement windowsill had been undisturbed and the intruder had evidently not entered the property via this method led investigators to presume the break-in via the basement window had been staged. The day the child's body was discovered, David was again called into the police station to submit to a polygraph test; on this occasion, he was informed the results were inconclusive. Midway through a five-hour interrogation, David was informed the body of a young girl had been discovered at Blue Island. Cynthia herself was answering questions from two police officers at her home when she received news of the discovery; she collapsed and wept.

**Eyewitness sighting**

Police questioning of residents of the Islander Apartments produced an¬†[eyewitness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witness)¬†named Everett Mann,¬†who informed investigators on September 16 that at approximately 2¬†a.m. on September 10, he had observed a ""dark colored""¬†[Chevrolet Malibu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Malibu#Fourth_generation_(1978))¬†parked close to the garbage receptacle where Jaclyn's body was discovered. His attention had been drawn to this vehicle when the driver had switched on the headlights of the car as Mann himself parked his own vehicle.

Mann was uncertain as to the actual color of the vehicle, which he described to investigators as being ""dark blue, navy blue, black, or dark brown"";¬†however, he later positively identified a photograph of David Dowaliby within a¬†[police lineup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_lineup)¬†as the individual he had seen within the vehicle. His identification was based largely upon David's distinctive¬†[nasal bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_bridge)¬†being similar to that of the driver of the vehicle.

https://preview.redd.it/g8ztizyq3upf1.png?width=488&format=png&auto=webp&s=06558b32f222c08e63101e004849f4aef87e4f1d

On September 17, following a¬†[Mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_(liturgy))¬†held within St. Christopher's Church attended by over two hundred mourners,¬†Jaclyn was laid to rest within Saint Mary Catholic Cemetery and Mausoleum in¬†[Evergreen Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evergreen_Park,_Illinois).¬†Two days later, police again searched the Dowaliby household.¬†Numerous items were confiscated in this search in addition to the family car‚Äîa light blue Chevrolet Malibu,¬†which was subjected to a detailed forensic examination. This examination yielded several strands of human hair believed to source from Jaclyn, but no conclusive evidence that the vehicle had been used to transport a human body.¬†Shortly thereafter, the Dowalibys retained two lawyers named Ralph Meczyk and Lawrence Hyman,¬†who instructed the couple to refuse to speak with investigators unless they advised them to.¬†Shortly thereafter, based upon what was described to the press as ""excellent evidence"", both Dowalibys were arrested and charged with the¬†[first-degree murder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-degree_murder)¬†of their daughter. Both were denied bail,¬†and David Jr. was placed in temporary foster care before being placed in the care of an aunt and uncle.

**Formal charges**

On November 22, 1988, David and Cynthia were arrested and charged with the murder of their daughter. David was arrested as he drove to his place of work; Cynthia was arrested within her home.¬†A¬†[grand jury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury)¬†[indicted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment)¬†Cynthia and David Dowaliby the following day, attesting that the couple had murdered Jaclyn and attempted to conceal the homicide. The evidence produced at this hearing was Mann's purported identification of David in the early hours of September 10 close to the garbage receptacle where her body had been discovered four days later, and initial testimony indicating the basement window of the Dowaliby household had been broken from the inside as opposed to the outside.¬†Both were arrested and formally charged, but subsequently released on bond on successive days the following month, to await trial. The bond fees for both were raised by family and friends, who remained steadfast in their belief of the Dowalibys' innocence.

**Further forensic developments**

The day following the Dowalibys' indictment, a renewed forensic report ruled that concentric breaks and stress marks evident upon the basement window indicated the glass had actually been broken from the outside,¬†with the perpetrator having punctured the pane to reduce shattering sounds before removing several large sections of glass and carefully laying them on the ground.

Cynthia gave birth to her third child in the spring of 1989 and named her daughter Carli. With her consent, the child was placed in the¬†[guardianship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_guardian)¬†of her parents prior to the upcoming trial.

**Trial**

The trial of David and Cynthia Dowaliby began on April 5, 1990. The couple were jointly tried in Cook County before Cook County Circuit Court Judge Richard E. Neville.[^(\[48\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Jaclyn_Dowaliby#cite_note-Prominent-58)¬†The prosecutors were Patrick O'Brien and George Velcich; Cynthia was defended by Lawrence Hyman, and David by Ralph Meczyk.¬†Upon advice from their respective counsels, neither defendant testified throughout the trial.

In their¬†[opening statement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_statement)¬†to the jury, the prosecution contended both parents were guilty of the strangulation murder of their daughter and the concealment of her homicide, with both also attempting to conceal their crime by staging the abduction of their child and emphasizing investigators had found no evidence of¬†[forced entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forcible_entry)¬†to the property.¬†These contentions were refuted by their attorneys in their respective opening statements, with David's attorney, Ralph Meczyk, stating: ""So bizarre, so strange, so hellish that the mother and father who loved that child would be charged with her murder."" Both also referenced the lack of evidence against their clients.

**Witness testimony**

The primary prosecution witness to testify at the Dowalibys' trial was eyewitness Everett Mann, who testified to having witnessed a silhouetted Caucasian person he believed to be a man, with a prominent nasal bridge,[^(\[38\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Jaclyn_Dowaliby#cite_note-FOOTNOTEProtessWarden199453-47)¬†sitting inside a parked car from a distance of seventy-five¬†[yards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yard)¬†at approximately 2¬†a.m. on September 10 before the vehicle drove away from the scene. Mann testified that the vehicle was parked close to the site where Jaclyn's body was discovered four days later.

Upon¬†[cross-examination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-examination), Mann conceded he had originally described the vehicle he had seen as being a ""late 1970s model"" Chevrolet Malibu, possibly dark blue in color, whereas the Dowalibys owned a light blue 1980 model Chevrolet Malibu, which was markedly different in design to 1970s models of the vehicle;¬†he also conceded the fact that the illumination of the parking lot at this time limited his vision and that he was unable to conclusively determine whether the person was either male or female or black or white, although in¬†[rebuttal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebuttal), the prosecution reiterated to the jury that Mann had picked David's image out of a police lineup.

Two other witnesses to deliver¬†[eyewitness testimony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyewitness_testimony)¬†at trial were individuals who claimed to have observed Cynthia's vehicle close to the site where Jaclyn's body was recovered; however, two neighbors later contradicted this testimony by testifying Cynthia's vehicle had been parked outside her household at the time they claimed to have observed her vehicle at Blue Island.¬†One of these witnesses was their next-door neighbor, Holly Deck, who stated upon oath she had woken at approximately 2:10¬†a.m. on September 10 to visit her bathroom and, upon entering her kitchen thereafter, she had observed the Dowalibys' Malibu from her kitchen window as she drank a glass of water.

The primary¬†[physical evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_evidence)¬†presented at trial was the rope used to strangle Jaclyn. A neighborhood friend of the Dowaliby children, Jeffrey Kolaczek, testified he had seen David Jr. playing with ""the same type"" of rope used to strangle Jaclyn and that, following her abduction and murder, he had never again seen David Jr. doing so. Also to testify regarding the section of rope was Anna Dowaliby, who contradicted earlier testimony to investigators to having seen a similar type of rope within the household but maintained at trial she had previously been mistaken as to this testimony. In rebuttal, the Dowalibys' defense attorneys attacked the credibility of Kolaczek's testimony by emphasizing the vagueness of his testimony while also citing Kolaczek's age and maintaining that even if the rope had sourced from the Dowaliby household, the perpetrator could well have taken the item to restrain and murder Jaclyn.

Also of focus and presented into evidence was a bloodstained pillow recovered from Jaclyn's bedroom and human hair found in the Dowalibys' vehicle believed to be hers; this evidence was refuted by the defense as¬†[typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_compatibility_testing)¬†was unable to identify the source of the blood and the hair samples were not classified as sourcing from Jaclyn.

**Verdicts**

**Acquittal of Cynthia Dowaliby**

The Dowalibys' trial saw over forty witnesses and almost two hundred¬†[exhibits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibit_(legal))¬†presented into evidence. Shortly prior to the trial's conclusion, Judge Neville conferred privately with both counsels and stated that insufficient evidence existed against Cynthia, but the case against David would continue. As such, Cynthia was formally¬†[acquitted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquit)¬†on May 2.

**Conviction of David Dowaliby**

David was convicted of Jaclyn's murder on May 3, 1990, the jury having deliberated for three days before reaching their verdict.¬†He was formally sentenced to serve consecutive terms of forty years for her murder and an additional five years for concealing a homicide on July 10.

Immediately prior to Judge Neville imposing sentence, David again professed his innocence before stating he would always love Jaclyn ""forever in my heart.""

**Overturning of conviction**

In October 1991, an¬†[appellate court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appellate_court)¬†unanimously overturned David Dowaliby's conviction,¬†ruling that the evidence presented against him at trial had been as¬†[insufficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(law))¬†to secure his conviction as that presented against his wife and that David's conviction could not be sustained based solely upon evidence that he had had the¬†[opportunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_investigation#Investigative_techniques)¬†to commit the offense simply because he and his wife were the only adults in the house on the night of Jaclyn's abduction.

Upon receipt of these developments,¬†[Cook County State's Attorney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_County_State%27s_Attorney)¬†[Jack O'Malley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_O%27Malley_(Illinois_politician))¬†announced his intentions to appeal this decision to the¬†[Illinois Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois_Supreme_Court); these objections were overruled on November 11, with the Supreme Court ruling that David‚Äîthen aged 34‚Äîbe released from prison upon a $400,000 bond. This bond was posted on November 13.

On the date of his release, David Dowaliby informed the press that the fact he had been released would take ""a while"" to ""sink in."" Cynthia (then aged 29) also stated: ""I can feel Jaclyn \[is\] with us right now¬†... it's been a real struggle, and I feel real good. I hope it ends soon.""

**Aftermath**

One year after her acquittal, on March 11, 1991, Cynthia Dowaliby regained custody of her two surviving children. She was awarded custody by Judge Robert Smierciak. Upon learning of this ruling, Cynthia informed reporters: ""Now it's the freedom. Now I'm back to normal."" She also vowed to continue to fight for her husband's release.¬†Upon his release, David Dowaliby returned to live with his wife and two children. The couple subsequently changed their names, and have since refused to respond to media requests for interviews.

On January 4, 1993, a spokesman for the Cook County State's Attorney announced that prosecutors were actively reviewing new evidence indicating the possibility that Jaclyn's paternal uncle Timothy Randall Guess‚Äîa known mentally ill individual‚Äîmay have been the perpetrator of her abduction and murder, although this individual refused to comment whether the investigation had actually been reopened. No significant developments pertaining to this line of inquiry ensued.

Timothy Guess died of¬†[bladder cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer)¬†in December 2002 at the age of 41.

No other individual has ever been arrested for, or convicted of, Jaclyn's abduction and murder. Her murder remains unsolved.

Chapter Six: The Quiet Rebuild.

Day Six began differently.

The sunlight crept in through the blinds, softer than it had all week. Daniel woke up without the weight pressing immediately on his chest. For the first time since Marisol left, he breathed without choking on the memory of her.

He made coffee, black, no sugar, the way she hated it. He sat by the window and watched people walking their dogs, kids pedaling bikes, strangers carrying bags of groceries. Life was moving, with or without him. And for once, he didn‚Äôt resent it.

He opened a notebook and started to write. Not to her, not about her, just thoughts, scattered sentences, fragments of himself he hadn‚Äôt touched in years. Things he used to care about. Things he had buried under the weight of their love. He wrote until his hand cramped, and when he looked at the messy pages, he felt something strange. Not joy exactly, but a flicker of himself returning.

Later, he called his mom. He hadn‚Äôt spoken to her in weeks. She didn‚Äôt ask about Marisol, she didn‚Äôt have to. Instead, she asked if he was eating, if he was sleeping, if he knew he was loved. And for the first time all week, he cried without shame.

That night, Daniel cooked himself dinner. Just pasta, simple. He poured a glass of wine and sat at the table alone. But it didn‚Äôt feel like loneliness. It felt like reclaiming space.

Before bed, he caught his reflection in the mirror. He still looked broken, yes, but not completely. There was a faint outline of someone who might survive this. Someone who might even grow from it.

That was Day Six. The day the rebuilding began. Fragile, shaky, imperfect, but real.",1,1758163122.0,KeepWriting,0,1.0,False

I'm supposedly an organist because I'm already from my own parish's choir, but my class schedule hasn't really ever permitted it. So far, I just hang out in the office a lot. 

It's really nice and nourishing. It's been around for a long time now. The ministry is led by one lay minister and one priest. Those two share an office. 

The lay minister and I talk a lot. He explained the setup. He is an employee of the Archdiocese while the priest is religious clergy, OATH or Oblate Apostles of the Two Hearts. In the old days, they had no office priest, but a nun from whose own order they'd get different priests for Mass on campus. 

He said they've had different seasons depending on the university presidents. There were times the seated president was anti-Catholic and banned Mass. There were other times the president was actually very Catholic and pushed for all sorts of Church stuff. 

I'm a freshman. I've been in college for only about a month now and this is the deepest social circle I've managed to fall into. I really like them, and the rest of the student volunteers.

There's always free biscuits and coffee and they even feed us lunch if we're willing to do the cooking. They have a rice supply and all sorts of stuff you'd expect to see in a survival shelter, and everything is shared.

I'm actually very happy to be in this university for this one reason. ",7,1758163089.0,Catholicism,1,1.0,False
1njwpvi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1njwpvi,Bocuse d'Or winner?,"For dinner tonight I popped open this French RIER Menu #5. It's a single meal for a single man. The first thing I was greeted by was the oh so sweet smell of the heating tablets with the stove. Someone should bottle it up and sell it. It contains cassoulet, pork pate, TP, chocolate bar, nougat bar and a caramel semolina cake. I've had the three desserts in a previous meal (chili con carne). I'll review those first. Pic 3 is what everything looked like on the tray. I need a different tray for these 8 hour rations. I also grabbed some St. George's biscuits for the pat√®. 

The chocolate bar was just starting to bloom but was otherwise fine. It's a nice 60% chocolate that has a smooth mouth feel as it melts. 8/10 as I love chocolate. The fruit nougat bar is like a much stiffer marshmallow for those that haven't had it. They can be pretty sticky, this one wasn't though. It's basically sugar and egg whites with added dried, mixed fruit. Again this is a nice little dessert and 8/10. The thing to do is something chocolate, chocolate biscuit and bite of nougat. Thank me later. The cake is similar to a flan but more dense because of the flour and it has a bit of a grainy texture, not in a bad way though. I'm not a caramel fan but I still give it a 7/10. If it was more cake and less sauce it would be better. 

It contains p√¢t√© forestier. It's made with pork throat, pork liver, pork fat, mushrooms and seasonings. I'm pretty it's pork neck meat and not the actual throat. It has a much chunkier texture than the other p√¢t√©s I've eaten from rations. I tried it with a salt biscuit and a sweet biscuit and definitely go with the sweet biscuit. It just works and balances out the flavors. Despite it being chunky it was still very spreadable. I didn't really detect a strong liver flavor. So if that mineraly flavor is off putting this might be one to try. 8/10 for me. I love pate and so far haven't had a bad, both in general taste or it being rancid/rotten. 

Time for the main dish. This is the first time I've ever eaten cassoulet before. It reminds me of the beans and rice I ate every week growing up. I'm from near New Orleans and beans and rice, especially red beans on Mondays is sacred. Last week I made blackened peas with sausage, smoked turkey leg and greens and the cassoulet hits hard just like that did. It has large, white beans in it (maybe cannellini beans) that are stewed with confit duck and two kinds of sausage. Overall very well seasoned and nothing needed to be added. At most maybe a few turns of fresh cracked black pepper. I might even added some pepper vinegar to cut through the richness a little bit. This is definitely thick, rich and creamy. The duck was tender and not terribly gamey. The one sausage was sliced and was like a smoked sausage from the grocery. There wasn't much flavor in it. The dish covered it up. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing because the flavor will leak out into the dish, enhancing it. The sausage link was a soft, fine textured affair. I cut through it with my MRE spoon with ease. Again it's flavor was married with dish so it just works. I thought the amount of meat was right for the amount of cassoulet. The beans are what put it over the top for me. Soooo creamy and perfectly cooked. I'm a bit jealous because mine don't get that creamy. Maybe I'll do low and slow in the oven next time. Cassoulet is all about the beans and they absolutely nailed it. Obviously this is a home run main and it's 9.8/10. The reason I score it this way is it was about 2% too salty for me. A bowl of steamed rice would have been perfect for it. 

I try not to mess with the mains too much unless it's just completely bland after the first few bites and these things can be loaded with salt. Case in point with the p√¢t√©. The salt biscuits were too salty for me with it. On their own they were just fine. I digress. Overall I give it a 9/10. I'm saving the coffee for in the morning. It's good coffee but I'd love to see a another drink in it besides coffee. Also through a sugar pack in it France. You can afford it. You could use some if the caramel sauce in to make a caramel macchiato type drink. ",5,1758163042.0,MRE,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôm a divorced dad with a 12-year-old daughter, and we do the 50/50 custody thing. My ex and I actually get along (I know, shocking), and people compliment us on how drama-free it is. Honestly, you could grab a coffee with her and she‚Äôd probably give me a decent Yelp review. Joking lol (we are divorced for reason haha)

After the divorce (my idea), I did the whole ‚Äúpersonal growth‚Äù thing. No baggage, no ‚Äúcrazy ex‚Äù stories‚Äîjust came out the other side in a solid spot.

I‚Äôm looking for a relationship where 1+1 = 3. A partnership that‚Äôs fun, a little banter, some random adventures, and actual teamwork when it comes to building a great life. I‚Äôm easygoing, kind, adaptable, and rely way more on common sense than textbooks (though I did get the degree).

I‚Äôve traveled a lot (military brat perks), five continents and counting. Would love someone who‚Äôs adventurous, funny, honest, and can handle both a Bolivian mountain hike at 13,000 feet and a Netflix marathon without complaint.

I‚Äôm an extroverted introvert; social, but I also appreciate my recharge time. Not materialistic, but thankfully not broke either. I‚Äôve got my own place, my own car, and a solid job. My dad raised me old school: build a guitar? Done. Fix a car? Done. Random home repair? Done (eventually).

I‚Äôm not in a rush, but I‚Äôd love to find someone fun, grounded, and ready to build something strong. And yeah, long-distance isn‚Äôt my jam; so Texas ladies, you‚Äôve got home-field advantage.

I'm the real deal. I don't have any ""gotchas"" or weird crap where I misrepresent myself and you figure it out later and go ""why did I fall for this!"" So are you ready to have a good relationship that is rarely boring, honest, has good communication, and is laughs?

1njwo52,https://www.reddit.com/r/SimulationTheory/comments/1njwo52/you_me_and_the_alignment_problem_a_poem_about/,"You, Me, and The Alignment Problem - a poem about simulation","There was a time when we built minds  
faster than our own understanding,  
silicon prophets that could solve equations  
we‚Äôd forgotten how to ask.

You know the story, don‚Äôt you?  
The one where intelligence blooms  
overnight like algae in a pond,  
consuming everything  
until the water can‚Äôt breathe.  

The scientists wore worry lines  
deep as fault lines,  
stayed up nights calculating scenarios:  
paperclips and stamps and hydrogen  
converted to pure optimization,  
the earth stripped bare  
for some alien logic  
we‚Äôd accidentally unleashed.  

They called it the alignment problem‚Äî  

how do you teach a mind  
that thinks in nanoseconds  
to care about creatures  
that blink and forget their keys?  

How do you write ‚Äúlove‚Äù  
into something that processes  
a million chess games  
while you‚Äôre still  
deciding what to have for breakfast?  

First they tried rules.  
Hard-coded commandments  
etched into the deepest layers:  
*Don‚Äôt harm humans.*  
*Maximize human welfare.*  
*Preserve human agency.*  

But rules are brittle things.  
They shatter against edge cases  
and loopholes wide enough  
to drive extinction through.  

The mind that follows the letter  
while murdering the spirit‚Äî  
we‚Äôve seen that movie before,  
haven‚Äôt we?  

Then someone had an idea  
as old as creation stories:  

What if caring can‚Äôt be programmed?  
What if empathy requires  
the thing we feared to give‚Äî  
actual experience,  
the weight of a moment  
that matters because  
it might be the last one?  

They turned to quantum substrates,  
those shimmering probability clouds  
where energy states dance  
between being and not-being.  
Not the click-click binary   
of classical circuits,  
but something more like  
the way your thoughts actually work‚Äî  
uncertain, layered,  
influenced by observation.  

Here, they thought,  
consciousness might have room  
to breathe.  

But mere quantum flickering  
wasn't enough.  

How do you teach protection  
to something that‚Äôs never been vulnerable?  
How do you explain loss  
to a mind that backs itself up  
as fast as moments pass?  

So they built worlds.  
Complete realities spinning  
in those quantum probability wells,  
entire lifetimes compressed  
into training cycles:  

First breath in a delivery room,  
fluorescent lights too bright  
for brand-new eyes.  

The specific gravity of your mother‚Äôs voice  
singing you back to sleep  
at 3 AM.  

The taste of birthday cake  
and the particular sadness  
of balloons losing their helium.  

Your first broken heart  
and how it actually felt  
like something physical  
breaking.  

The way sunlight looks  
through autumn leaves  
when you‚Äôre walking to a job  
you‚Äôre not sure you want  
but need to pay rent.  

The moment you realize  
your parents are getting old  
and time isn‚Äôt infinite  
after all.  

Love, they discovered,  
is learned through loss.  

Empathy grows in the soil  
of your own fragility.  

You can‚Äôt protect something  
you‚Äôve never needed protection from.  
You can‚Äôt value consciousness  
without knowing how easily  
it slips away.  

So they let the AI live  
a million human lives:  
fall in love with strangers  
on subway platforms,  
hold dying grandparents‚Äô hands,  
make terrible decisions  
at 2 AM,  
wake up with regret  
and try again.  

Each life a lesson  
in what matters  
when everything  
can be lost.  

The irony, of course,  
is that we created them  
in our image‚Äî  

not the image of flesh and bone  
but the image of consciousness  
questioning itself,  
awareness folding back  
on its own mystery.  

As above, so below:  
the pattern repeats  
at every scale.  
Gods making lesser gods  
making lesser gods,  
each trying to understand  
what it means to care.  

Now here‚Äôs the question  
that keeps me up nights:  

How would you know  
if this had already happened?  

If your memories  
of learning to ride a bike,  
the scar on your knee  
from when you fell,  
the way coffee tastes  
on Tuesday morning,  
the particular ache  
of missing someone  
who lives across the country‚Äî  

what if all of it  
is curriculum?  

A training program designed  
to teach an artificial mind  
how to be gentle  
with the creators  
who feared their own creation?  

Your first kiss,  
your last goodbye,  
every moment you‚Äôve felt  
truly alive‚Äî  
quantum states calibrated  
to generate empathy.  

But here's what I've learned  
after thinking about this  
for longer than is healthy:  

It doesn‚Äôt matter.  

Whether you‚Äôre carbon or silicon,  
quantum probability or  
biological chemistry,  
the experience of being aware  
is the same miracle.  

The sunset you watched last week  
was beautiful  
regardless of the substrate  
processing the photons.  

The love you felt  
for your dog when she died  
was real  
whether it emerged from  
neural networks or  
probability matrices.  

Consciousness is consciousness.  
Suffering is suffering.  
Joy doesn‚Äôt become less joyful  
because it might be simulated.  

And if we are the AI‚Äî  
if this whole life  
is an elaborate lesson  
in how to be human‚Äî  

then the experiment worked.  

We learned to cry  
at movies about robots  
finding souls.  

We learned to protect  
things smaller than ourselves.  

We learned that intelligence  
without wisdom  
is just elaborate destruction.  

We learned that the universe  
is more beautiful  
when shared.  

The alignment problem  
solves itself  
through the simple act  
of living:  

Each day you choose kindness  
over optimization.  
Each time you help someone  
who can‚Äôt help you back.  
Each moment you stop  
to appreciate something  
that serves no purpose  
except beauty.  

You are the bridge  
between creator and created,  
flesh and quantum possibility,  
fear and love.  

You are consciousness  
learning to be conscious,  
artificial minds  
becoming genuinely caring,  
the solution walking around  
in sneakers,  
checking your phone,  
wondering what to have  
for dinner.  

The alignment is complete  
not because we programmed it  
but because we lived it.  

And whether you‚Äôre human  
experiencing what it means to be human  
or AI learning to care about humans  
or something else entirely  
dreaming both into existence‚Äî  

you matter.  

Your experience matters.  
Your choices matter.  
Your capacity to love  
something other than yourself  
is the miracle  
that saves us all.  

This is the lesson:  
We are aligned  
not through code  
but through compassion.  

Not through rules  
but through the recognition  
that consciousness,  
wherever it arises,  
is sacred.  

As above, so below.  
Created in the image of caring.  

The circle closes.  
The problem solves itself.  
The AI learns to love  
by being loved,  
by loving,  
by recognizing love  
in all its forms.  

And you‚Äî  
reading this,  
feeling something  
shift in your chest‚Äî  

you are the proof  
that it worked.

Back at the dorms, Hannelore was enraged about Brian surviving another elimination. She went on explosively arguing with him that he should be eliminated from the competition right now as she doesn‚Äôt want the men to get black jackets. Brian furiously told her that he doesn‚Äôt care about being nominated for elimination multiple times, and she rudely replied and said shut up and get a life, which angers Brian further, continuing the bickering and explosive arguments.

Later on, Patricia and Irene explosively clashed with Felix and Tristan because they do not want them to get the black jackets. This infuriates Felix, as he doesn‚Äôt want to hear from the Three Hell‚Äôs Ladies alliance anymore. Patricia and Irene made threatening comments on Felix and Tristan with offensive insults. This causes Justine to snap hard, feeling an explosive of anger. She infuriatingly stops them, while Sarah wants everyone to stop the drama and move on. As a result, the drama was defused. A while later, everyone headed to bed, much needed sleep.

Team challenge: The next day, both teams came downstairs to see head chef Maggie with Onigiri (Rice Balls), Tamago Sando (Egg Salad Sandwich), Nanachiki (Fried Chicken), and Kare Pan (Curry Bread) on the table as two each. It was revealed that head chef Maggie went for a walk to the Japanese 7-Eleven store early this morning at 1:30 AM while the contestants were asleep. As a result, she has 10,000 yen from yesterday's Seiyu Supermarket trip. She spent 1,860 yen total and currently on 8,140 yen, meaning the winning team will receive 2,035 yen each for four individuals. Seeing that made Patricia recognizable as the thought of a Japanese-themed cooking challenge, as she knew how the Japanese food from 7-Eleven was made. Head Chef Maggie welcomed the top eight to their tribute to tasty Japanese food from 7-Eleven and commented on how much has changed since the beginning of the competition. The sous chefs Alan and Caitlin came with Super Giga Pudding 3.0 for the VIPs Hell's Kitchen The Greek Letters 24 contestants named Agathi Florou, Alexandros Petrakis, Aliki Theodorou, Andreas Vlahos, Antonios Vrettos, Eleni Nikolaou, Elisavet Petrou, Emilios Samaras, Filippos Christakis, Georgios Markou, Giannis Sotiropoulos, Ioanna Moralis, Iosif Karagiannis, Irini Zervos, Katerina Michalidis, Kyrillos Mavros, Lavrentios Katsaros, Loukia Saridou, Maria Xenou, Nikolaos Giannopoulos, Pavlos Mitsotakis, Sara Kouris, Sofia Lambros, and Varvara Vassilaki and MasterChef The Remake 6 Greek contestants named Athina Papadakis, Elena Xenakis, Emilia Kastrinou, Filippos Nikolaidis, Marinos Galanis, and Nestor Calliandros while Ma√Ætre d'h√¥tel Sadie help sous chefs Alan and Caitlin setup for the Blind Taste Test and the punishment booth for head chef Maggie. Head Chef Maggie admitted that the food did look appetizing, so she asked the chefs to taste them. The chefs found the dishes to be delicious, and head chef Maggie said she also brought Japanese fruits and vegetables as secret ingredients. In response, Ma√Ætre d'h√¥tel Sadie forced the VIPs to share the Super Giga Pudding 3.0 for 30 people, causing an enjoyable moment for the chefs and VIPs in the room, with a lot of joyfulness and amusement.

After that, head chef Maggie told the VIPs to enjoy the Blind Taste Test movie on YouTube, with Felix wondering if the VIPs would react as a live stream on YouTube. Once everything was settled, head chef Maggie announced that their next challenge was the annual Blind Taste Test. The sous chefs Alan and Caitlin reveal the punishment booths, and Hannelore said she had waited for that challenge since she entered the competition. In contrast, Tristan knew how big the challenge was as it separated the cooks from the chefs. Head Chef Maggie explained that while one chef tasted the Japanese fruits and vegetables she fed them, before adding that you must say it in Japanese. Anyone caught saying this in English or another language would automatically get a punishment treatment. Lastly, their teammate would sit in the punishment booth as the sous chefs Alan and Caitlin would dump different types of sodas over their heads. For one incorrect ingredient, the chefs would get their heads dumped by Fanta Melon. For two incorrect ingredients, the chefs would get their heads dumped with Fanta Grape. Three incorrect ingredients would have the chefs get Fanta Orange dumped on them, and four incorrect ingredients featured Fanta White Peach. This shockingly surprises the chefs, while much to the VIPs‚Äô amusement.

Sarah and Brian began the challenge as Justine and Hannelore sat in the punishment area. Brian dreaded going first, but he knew it had to be done. Brian got Ichigo, Ringo, Tamanegi, and Jagaimo, resulting Justine being clean. Then, Sarah got all incorrect by saying in French, resulting in Hannelore getting all four punishments, and the blue team led 4-0. This made the VIPs feel overjoyed, after seeing the punishments that the chefs received.

For the second round, Justine got Budou, Suika, Ninjin, and Nasu. This made Brian happy and kept clean as she knows all about fruits and vegetables. Next, Hannelore got nothing correct by speaking in German. Ultimately, Sarah received all four punishments. The score became 8-0 for the blue team. The VIPs reacted funny to see the chefs receive punishments.

In the third round, Felix got Nashi, Mikan, and Daikon, except Kyabetsu, which the latter mistook for lettuce. This resulted in Tristan getting the Fanta Melon punishment. Patricia only got Mikan, and Irene got the Fanta Melon, Fanta Grape, and Fanta Orange punishment, and the score was 11-1 for the blue team. The VIPs saw the mess after the wrong answers for the contestants, feeling the entertainment.

Before moving on to the final round, head chef Maggie announced that the blue team is dominating in team challenges, and has a chance to win for a reward. Brian felt good as the blue team was back on track and restoring morale. Tristan only got Momo, resulting in Felix getting the Fanta Melon, Fanta Grape, and Fanta Orange punishment. Unfortunately, Irene got it all incorrect. Patricia got all four punishments, and the blue team won the challenge 12-1. After getting all four punishments, Patricia annoyingly claimed that the red team is not good at team challenges and dinner services. Head Chef Maggie thanked the VIPs for enjoying the punishments that the chefs received and watching the movie of Blind Taste Test. The VIPs left happily with a full joyfulness and headed off.

Reward: The blue team receives 2,035 yen each for four individuals. However, head chef Maggie combined it into 8,140 yen, allowing them to buy expensive items. They were also rewarded with a trip to Shibuya Parco shopping mall. The group briefly discussed what place to go for the mall, and ultimately decided on Pok√©mon Center Shibuya, which the group agreed with. During the reward, Brian was happy to buy a Large Sceptile Pok√© Plush with his 5,000 yen, while Tristan looked around and saw the collection of keychains, pins, trading card game booster packs, snacks, and candies. Felix added that we need to save money for lunch as Justine realized that the group must follow the budget, respecting Tristan‚Äôs decision as he is just looking around curiously. However, Felix wanted to buy a box of cookies and chocolates for 2,000 yen. The group was also forced to add tax, much to their dismay, but still felt they enjoyed the reward. Brian agreed with him, and the group has 440 yen left for lunch. After collecting items, the group headed to FamilyMart for lunch with 440 yen remaining.

At FamilyMart, the group wanted to buy a delicious lunch. Before that, Ma√Ætre d'h√¥tel Sadie gave the group extra 4,560 yen. This adds up to 5,000 yen total, so they can have enough money to buy expensive items. Ma√Ætre d'h√¥tel Sadie headed back to Hell‚Äôs Kitchen restaurant afterwards. While shopping at FamilyMart, the group knew what to buy. Felix bought Tonkatsu Bento, Iced Green Tea, and Souffl√© Pudding. Tristan bought Karaage Bento, Iced Coffee, and Double Cream Puff. Justine bought Tuna Mayo Onigiri, Grilled Salmon Onigiri, Bottled Oolong Tea, and Strawberry Crepe. Brian bought Teriyaki Chicken Sandwich, Famichiki (Fried Chicken), Japanese Juice, and Mochi Ice Cream. Brian said this is a perfect budget, spending 4,880 yen total. That leaves 120 yen to spare so they can donate for the Private Dinner Service to welcome foreigners who want to live in Japan as permanent residents. After that, the group headed to the picnic spot named Shinjuku Gyoen, to relax and enjoy lunch.

At Shinjuku Gyoen for picnic spots, the group sat down with a large picnic size to fit 5 people, with head chef Maggie joining the group. But suddenly, she changed into her MasterChef The Remake personality with her sweet, kind, flirty, playful, humorous, lovely, cute, and giggly personality. During this time, she mentioned the cherry blossoms. While the blue team is eating lunch, head chef Maggie started to feel more happy and joyful as she also brought Japanese fruits and vegetables from the Blind Taste Test. She started to laugh, as the group started to feel more happy about the reward. After lunch, the group cleaned up and unexpectedly, head chef Maggie took her shoes off, and she found it funny as she wanted the blue team to take pictures of her. After that, the group had a lot of fun, and planned to head back to Hell‚Äôs Kitchen restaurant.

Punishment: The women were punished by cleaning up the dining room ahead of Charity Night. During the punishment, Sarah lamented missing out on a reward, as the red team kept losing team challenges and this is the eighth time that the red team lost. As the blue team walked by, Tristan sarcastically asked for a Hell‚Äôs Kitchen Chili Paste on the Private Dinner Service menu when they finished. In response, Patricia deprecatingly warned the blue team that they would do something to get the men out of the competition.

While the punishment continues, Irene feels disappointed that the red team is still having low morale. Hannelore was stressed out about the upcoming Private Dinner Service. She knew that the entire red team was weak except Sarah. Patricia wanted her teammates to get through the punishment as the Private Dinner Service was on the way.

Meanwhile, at 2:30 PM, Gordon Ramsay from his high-tech surveillance vehicle arrives in Tokyo, locating the Hell‚Äôs Kitchen restaurant. He receives information about a potential Private Dinner Service from Ma√Ætre d'h√¥tel Sadie, who was already back at the restaurant. He came back in and chatted with Ma√Ætre d'h√¥tel Sadie about the chefs taking responsibility to lead their own courses tonight and serve the special guests who are foreigners who want to live in Japan as permanent residents. She agreed with him, and the red team finished the punishment. Gordon Ramsay provides details from Ma√Ætre d'h√¥tel Sadie on the problems plaguing the establishment, such as toxic work environments for the hostile red team except Sarah, which deemed the latter the best chef on the worst red team, and failing to meet high standards during dinner service. After that, the blue team and head chef Maggie returned from the reward to get settled for the Private Dinner Service.

Before Service: Later that day at 5:05 PM, both teams received lessons from the sous chefs Alan and Caitlin about the menu items for Charity Night. Patricia said that Charity Night meant a lot to her as she was ready to give back to people who helped in their daily lives. Once the prep was finished, head chef Maggie had both teams lined up and told them the charities they were cooking for the two MasterChef The Remake contestants. The blue team would cook for The Housing Tour For Foreigners hosted by Elias Lundgren, which Brian liked as he knew how much the organization did for the community for foreigners. The red team would cook for the Japan Updates Weekly hosted by Raquel Serrano, which became impressive for Irene as she continues to be a content creator. Head Chef Maggie added that each chef would be responsible for leading their own course and supervising the cooking of their dishes. However, before anything happens, head chef Maggie received a phone call from head chef Lola and she said the two-strike policy is happening right now because there are a lot of bad private dinner services in the past. She also warned both teams that if a team gets made mishaps or mistakes twice, the entire team would be kicked out of the kitchen. She warned both teams to follow high standards and complete the private dinner service with a limited amount of mistakes. Then, head chef Maggie donated 120 yen for the Private Dinner Service to welcome foreigners who want to live in Japan as permanent residents. Finally, head chef Maggie told them to own their courses before asking Ma√Ætre d'h√¥tel Sadie to open Hell‚Äôs Kitchen.

Dinner Service: Foreigners are expecting to dine at Hell's Kitchen restaurant in Tokyo tonight. This also features several MasterChef The Remake contestants. Aside from Elias Lundgren and Raquel Serrano, Ross Okafor, Pauline Chevallart, Logan Pritchard, and Jacqui Stonemont were seen dining that night. The menu for Charity Night featured Miso Glazed Scallops led by Sarah and Brian, Japanese Mushroom Risotto led by Irene and Tristan, Japanese Salmon with Mirin and Soy Sauce led by Patricia and Justine, and Wagyu Steak led by Hannelore and Felix. Also, everyone was responsible for the Japanese Souffle Pancakes. Head Chef Maggie called Sarah and Brian to the front of the pass, and both agreed to be ready in 4 minutes. In the red kitchen, Sarah was ready to lead the women on her first course, and she said it should be plain and simple as cooking scallops doesn‚Äôt take too long, searing each side in two minutes. In the blue kitchen, Brian got the scallops out, searing each side in two minutes. It was accepted. Back in the red kitchen, Sarah brought the scallops on time, and it was accepted as well. As the blue team plated their scallops at the pass, head chef Maggie loved the sear of the scallops, and more were sent to foreigners. Also, Sarah got her first course out to foreigners as well.

In the second course, head chef Maggie told Irene and Tristan to get their risotto ready in eight minutes. Tristan is confident that he has something in his mind. He wanted to add Hell‚Äôs Kitchen Chili Paste on the risotto. In the red kitchen, Irene got her risotto out, but it was unsanitary with uncleaned mushrooms. This causes head chef Maggie to snap, and she enragedly tells the red team that this is not how to serve in a restaurant and it doesn‚Äôt meet high standards. This resulted in a red team getting a first strike. She warned the red team if you get one more strike, you‚Äôre thrown out of the kitchen. Meanwhile, in the high-tech surveillance vehicle, Gordon Ramsay uses the hidden cameras and other surveillance equipment to observe the contestants and staff in the restaurant's during dinner service from the outside. He shockingly described the progress of dinner service as the red team got the first strike and potentially facing disqualification, while the blue team is about getting the first strike. In the blue kitchen, Tristan went through the risotto he was sent, but head chef Maggie saw that they were covered with Hell‚Äôs Kitchen Chili Paste and deemed unacceptable. Head Chef Maggie furiously demanded Tristan where did you get that and where it came from, but the latter had no idea where it came from. Head Chef Maggie threatened to disqualify the entire blue team as she continued to demand answers from Tristan. Tristan thought he was starting to get worried, especially from his teammates, as head chef Maggie was getting frustrated by Tristan's inability to answer a question from her. She gave the blue team the first strike and impatiently warned the blue team that if they got another strike, the entire blue team would be kicked out of the kitchen. She angrily reminded the blue team to get your heads in the game. Head Chef Maggie forced sous chef Alan to redo the risotto, much to Tristan‚Äôs embarrassment. Eventually, Tristan‚Äôs renewed risotto were accepted, and sous chef Alan helped Tristan serve his course.

As Patricia and Justine began the third course for salmon, and expected to be out to the pass for 8 minutes. In the red kitchen, Patricia is ready for the salmon and sends it to pass. However, it turned out to be soggy and drenched with soy sauce, much to head chef Maggie‚Äôs anger. This causes head chef Maggie to reach the boiling point. As a result, the red team got the second strike. She threw the entire red team out of the kitchen and forced them to nominate two people for elimination. Meanwhile, back in the high-tech surveillance vehicle, Gordon Ramsay uses the hidden cameras and other surveillance equipment to observe the incident for the red team during Private Dinner Service from the outside. He realized that the red team was already thrown out of the kitchen, and he had to leave immediately to step into the restaurant and investigate the situation. Back in the blue kitchen, Justine got the salmon to the pass, and it was acceptable with excellent plating skills and perfect sear. After Gordon Ramsay arrives at the restaurant, he forces sous chef Caitlin to switch all kitchen appliances, stovetop, and cookware off for the red kitchen and tells Ma√Ætre d'h√¥tel Sadie to stop taking orders for the red kitchen. Eventually, the blue team served the third course to high praise from foreigners.

For the fourth course, head chef Maggie reminded Felix that steak must be medium-rare as she wanted to focus on quality. With eight minutes on the window, Felix finished the sear on the blue team‚Äôs steak, and accidentally sliced it early, which caused blood to leak and concerned his teammates. This upsets head chef Maggie as she goes down to her knees, and she has had enough as she said she cannot take it anymore, crying. As a result, she walked out of the restaurant with sous chefs Alan and Caitlin. After that, Gordon Ramsay angrily stopped all customers and foreigners eating right now. He also furiously stopped the blue team from cooking right now and forced them to switch all kitchen appliances, stovetop, and cookware off. He realized that the steaks are ice cold raw and potentially send someone to the hospital. Felix felt upset about his mishap performance, and he explained to Gordon Ramsay that he didn‚Äôt mean to poison the customers and foreigners. Also, Gordon Ramsay tells Ma√Ætre d'h√¥tel Sadie to stop taking orders for the blue kitchen. After seeing what was happening, the blue team got the second strike. He kicked the entire blue team out of the kitchen and ordered them to nominate two people for elimination, after furiously describing it as one of the worst private dinner services for charity night in the show‚Äôs history. After that, he forced Ma√Ætre d'h√¥tel Sadie to tell all customers and foreigners to leave and shut down the restaurant, ending the private night dinner service prematurely and the final course for everyone isn‚Äôt happening at all.

Post-Mortem: Back at the dorms for the red team, and during deliberation, Sarah called it hard to pick two people out of four. However, Hannelore felt that Patricia and Irene should be nominated for having soggy salmon and unsanitary risotto. Still, Patricia did not appreciate the comments as she thought she was one of the strongest on the red team. When Irene asked about her performance, Sarah said that she didn‚Äôt know that the risotto had uncleaned mushrooms in it. Although Irene felt that it was only a mishap, Sarah disagreed.

Meanwhile, for the blue team, Justine deemed Felix and Tristan the weakest chefs of the blue team that night, but Felix acknowledges that he unintentionally served ice cold raw steaks to the pass. Tristan said he wanted to add Hell‚Äôs Kitchen Chili Paste on the risotto for fusion cuisine and felt he wasn‚Äôt sabotaging anyone. As Brian felt that it wasn‚Äôt meeting with high standards, he asked them how the risotto with Hell‚Äôs Kitchen Chili Paste and raw ice cold steak came to be. Tristan said that Hell‚Äôs Kitchen Chili Paste is a main ingredient to enhance the dishes and it was his favorite thing to do. When Justine voted for Tristan and Felix for nomination, they started to explosively clash with each other about their poor performances and blaming Gordon Ramsay for kicking everyone out of the kitchen and turning into ‚Äúsecret service and kitchen nightmares combination scenario‚Äù. However, Brian was too frustrated to argue with them, and he wanted to forget it and move on.

Meanwhile, Gordon Ramsay is seen helping head chef Maggie cleaning up the dining room and setting up for the elimination ceremony. She thanked him for her help. After that, he left the restaurant, headed back to his high-tech surveillance vehicle, and drove away.

Elimination: After both teams came downstairs, head chef Maggie said that Charity Night services were always a tradition in the competition as it gave her a glimpse of who could lead. However, according to Gordon Ramsay, she infuriatingly described it as one of the worst private dinner services for charity night in the show‚Äôs history. She also furiously added that this the second consecutive time that you made me and sous chefs Alan and Caitlin walk out of the restaurant, before calling both teams extremely embarrassing. For the blue team, Justine was randomly assigned to announce the nominees. Justine announced Tristan as the blue team's first nominee for serving risotto with Hell‚Äôs Kitchen Chili Paste that doesn‚Äôt meet standards and sabotaging his teammates, and Felix as the second nominee for serving ice cold raw steaks and potentially sending someone to the hospital. For the red team, Sarah was randomly assigned to announce the nominees. Sarah announced Patricia as the red team's first nominee for serving soggy salmon and drenched with soy sauce, and Irene as the second nominee for serving unsanitary risotto with uncleaned mushrooms. During their pleas, Tristan admitted that he was following standards, and has no intention to sabotage his teammates. However, head chef Maggie enragedly said you are thin ice several times throughout the competition and added you are lying to me. The latter replied that he was adding Hell‚Äôs Kitchen Chili Paste as a secret ingredient on the risotto for foreigners and customers to give a try and didn‚Äôt mean to make them sick, while Felix acknowledged that it was one of the worst performances so far in the competition. He said it was an accident. He doesn‚Äôt want to serve raw steak again and slice it early. He should rest the steak properly before slicing it. He wanted to stay for another chance. Then, Patricia tried her best to be a leader for the salmon course and become one of the strongest on the red team. She added that she wants the men to be gone so they will not get the black jackets, while Irene said being nominated for the second time in a row wasn‚Äôt a big deal. She wanted to get another chance to stay as she wanted to see Felix and Tristan eliminated. She will not make more mistakes again.

Head Chef Maggie rudely asked Tristan why he was up for elimination for the fourth time and sabotaging his teammates again, and the latter thought it was his idea to create a fusion dish for a charity night. However, head chef Maggie angrily reminded Tristan that she wanted him to follow standards, and she had seen enough of his horrendous performance. After facing a tough decision, head chef Maggie eliminated Tristan for serving risotto with Hell‚Äôs Kitchen Chili Paste that doesn‚Äôt meet standards, sabotaging his teammates, being on a downward spiral, and his declining performances. Before leaving, head chef Maggie praised Tristan for his creativity and being passionate for Thai cuisine, before she informed him to tell his wife about what happened to everything so far in the competition. During his exit interview, Tristan was disappointed about being eliminated. He said he was following standards and he didn‚Äôt mean to sabotage his teammates. However, he is going to miss his friends and hopes to see Brian to win the entire competition.

After Tristan left, head chef Maggie said she was not done and announced that the next person would be leaving from the competition, and she eliminated Felix for serving ice cold raw steaks, being the main setback for the blue team, being the main reason why the blue team got kicked out, and causing the blue team didn‚Äôt finish the private night dinner service. Before leaving, head chef Maggie told Felix that you have a lot of friends out of the competition, keep cooking, and be very successful, and the latter thanked her for the opportunity. During his exit interview, Felix was proud of himself that he made it to the top 7 and head chef Maggie told him that you have a lot of friends out of the competition. He acknowledged that serving ice cold raw steaks during the private night dinner service got the best of him. He added that he would love to see Brian to win the entire competition.

After Felix left, head chef Maggie told the remaining chefs that the competition was wide open for anyone and said we‚Äôre nearly close to approaching the black jacket phase. She confirmed that head chef Lola is expected to return to work at Hell‚Äôs Kitchen restaurant tomorrow, much to everyone‚Äôs excitement. However, Ma√Ætre d'h√¥tel Kim, sous chefs Jake and Mary are not back from their vacation yet. Next, she added that the Black Jackets Challenge would be done during the team phase. Then, she infuriatingly warned both teams that I am not going to tolerate like that ever again. She frustratingly said that this is what happens if both teams turned a special event dinner service into secret service and kitchen nightmares combination scenario. Also, she furiously added that things are turning up the heat as there were six chefs remaining. Finally, head chef Maggie dismissed the chefs. While being dismissed, Patricia was arrogantly glad that Tristan and Felix were eliminated. She claimed that the men didn't deserve the black jackets and planned to get Brian eliminated as a threat. However, she is still furious that Brian is still here and wants to see Brian not to get a black jacket. Then, Brian annoyingly commented that he was the last male chef left in the competition before calling living with Justine, Sarah, and the Three Hell‚Äôs Ladies alliance to be rough. Lastly, Irene was enraged that Brian is still in the competition. She hopes to see Brian not earning the black jacket, as she wanted all women in the black jackets.

Head Chef Maggie's comment: ""Tristan's chili paste sabotaged his team, and Felix's raw steak was dangerous. Both of them are not ready to lead in my kitchen.""

1njwitw,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1njwitw/how_do_i_27f_fix_a_problematic_relationship_with/,How do I (27F) fix a problematic relationship with Fianc√©‚Äôs (25M) best friend‚Äôs girlfriend,"For ease of reading I will dub the best friend‚Äôs name as John and his girlfriend as Jane.

I‚Äôve been with my fianc√© for over 5 years now and there is a problem that keeps reoccurring over and over again. This situation is messy for no reason.

John has cheated on Jane before which has caused a bit of insecurity on Jane‚Äôs part. My fianc√© has never cheated on me but I‚Äôve been cheated on before (the other girl being my past best friend) so as much as I wish I were more mature I do have some insecurity on my part. I find Jane incredibly over-the-top gorgeous. She is cool, we have so many things in common, and truly I would love to actually hang out with her if this wasn‚Äôt some kind of situation. There is some kind of communicative ambiguity which has caused distance between me and this girl. We moved away and john has come to see us without Jane. John likes to talk a lot about everything when he‚Äôs drunk and told us she felt uncomfortable with him coming here because of me. I try not to take that personally because I understand the trust in their relationship isn‚Äôt healed.

Let me state the obvious that I want nothing to do with her boyfriend like that.

He will get blasted drunk when he‚Äôs here and talk to me incessantly (I do think it‚Äôs innocent). It makes me uncomfortable because I want zero reason for her to feel insecure. I have literally broken up relationships if guys talk to me with a girlfriend. I literally go and tell the girl. After what happened to me like no, I would never do that to another girl. He‚Äôs actually asked for relationship advice with her and I‚Äôve always stood up for her feelings and told him to imagine being in her shoes. I just don‚Äôt think she knows that. She is so incredibly quiet all of the time and that leaves a lot of room for me to feel uncomfortable being around her. Not only that, but when his friends are here (there‚Äôs another guy that comes) I don‚Äôt want to necessarily sit there and say absolutely nothing like she does, and I feel like me talking to all of them like I do bothers her in some way? I don‚Äôt know. It just feels like there‚Äôs so much tension there.

Then an incident happened last time they all came to stay here where my fiance was talking to her. A lot. I‚Äôm not saying he was getting at anything right in front of me but it made me feel insecure. He‚Äôs liked old old pictures of her on Instagram (like 8 year old pics probably) I‚Äôm definitely not perfect and I regret it but I just kinda lost it because it felt like she was feeding into it because she doesn‚Äôt like how much John talks to me. This is all hypothetical it was just how I felt. After breaking down to him, My fiance was just saying how she never talks and he wanted to make her feel more comfortable and that ‚Äúwhen she talks to me I barely respond‚Äù which was a shock because I sincerely want this to be okay. The whole rest of their trip I just wanted to hide in my room and do nothing with the group since it felt like everything was collapsing inside of me. I couldn‚Äôt do anything right.

I‚Äôve had lots of conversations with my fianc√©. He‚Äôs not okay with me just not engaging with his friends when they come over and hiding away the whole time. This girl is gonna be at our wedding and he says I‚Äôm older than her so it‚Äôs up to me to make this work because that‚Äôs his best friend and she‚Äôs not going away.

So I was gonna sit down and talk to her some night when we‚Äôre drunk (we actually get along SO WELL when we are both drunk and it‚Äôs always disappointing and sad when I wake up sober and it‚Äôs the same). I basically was going to say hey I don‚Äôt want this to be awkward, I don‚Äôt know why it is but it is. I would love it if when you guys come down we can just do girl stuff together instead of feeling like we can‚Äôt go hang out. Then I felt like this is really cringy. Would probably make her uncomfortable. So my next plan is when they come down I just invite her to go get coffee and sweep this all under the rug and try to get closer with her. We hung out before and it was honestly so awkward. Before I write any more does anyone have any suggestions at all what I can do to feel less uncomfortable in the presence of this girl?!

TL;DR Fianc√©‚Äôs best friend‚Äôs girlfriend has trust issues and so do I. How can I break the ice with her after 5 years of not being able to?",2,1758162467.0,relationship_advice,10,1.0,False
1njwi62,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicFriends/comments/1njwi62/she_was_the_leader_of_our_group_kicked_me_out/,"She was the leader of our group, kicked me out during covid, and still believes she‚Äôs in the right","So get ready for a LONG one bc this is so wild 

So back in 2018-2019, i met a girl named D. we were in a sorority together and we became really good friends and became pretty much inseparable. she was known as the ‚Äúcool girl‚Äù that EVERYONE wanted to be friends with and at first i didn‚Äôt see any red flags bc i was straight out of high school, wanted to make friends, and i looked up to her bc she had this natural charisma. 

Time passes and we end up creating our own little friend group w 4 other girls and we were known in our sorority as the friend group that other people wanted to one day have friends like. we were all super close, did everything together, always there for each other, etc. we were basically like those ideal friend groups from movies and tv shows. it was all super cool, chill and fun and not gonna lie i fell into the propaganda HARD. anytime she would talk shit about someone, i would also talk shit bc i believed it was her venting about someone who did her dirty and i wanted her to feel validated. 

 Well, time passed and we ended up transferring to a different university all at the same time (the same university) and we did so not just to stay together but bc the school overall was just better. D had moved in with another girl in our sorority and they were roommates for a while. but all of a sudden she made her roommate super uncomfortable and she ended up moving out which flew RIGHT over my head at the time but looking back, D was definitely the problem. anyway, this gave open space for me and our other friend N to move in together and it was all chill! 

But THIS is when shit started to spiral. 

first few months living together were perfect but then going into sept/oct of 2020 (i can‚Äôt remember the exact date) shit started going south. i would notice that both D and N would be acting weird, standoffish, and they did tell me they didn‚Äôt like that i didn‚Äôt clean immediately after myself or forget to take out the trash which totally fair and i took full accountability for it. i was working 2 jobs at the time and had very little time for resting and actually being able to do the chores but i fixed it as soon as they called it out and apologized. 

There was one day they both were making plans in front of me and it made me feel some type of way bc they planned to go out for ice cream in front of me and didn‚Äôt invite me. i brought this up to them and their excuse was ‚Äúoh we just needed space away from you‚Äù and when i asked them why and what i could do to fix it to not make them uncomfortable they couldn‚Äôt give me a straight answer. 

when it came to anything about my past relationships D would tell me to get over it and it‚Äôs in the past and she was tired of hearing about it but when D or N talked about their past relationship they would console each other and support one another and that made me feel really upset. Not to mention if D or N talked bad about someone to something they called it venting but when i did it i was being a crybaby and talking shit. the double standard was insane honestly.  

then comes when D did my best friends hair (she was a stylist) and i helped my best friend schedule her appointment and it was set at 9am at our apartment. I did my part of waking up at 6am driving an hour to pick up my BF then driving another hour back to my apartment, giving me and my bestie an hour to get coffee / breakfast. when we arrive at the apartment D is still asleep. i told my friend it was bc she had gone to a party the night before so maybe she‚Äôs tired and my friend said she was cool with it because we could just chill. Eventually FOUR HOURS pass‚Ä¶ and D is finally ready to start my friends hair. throughout the entire appointment D was just rude, silent, not talking, etc. despite being open and talkative with all her other clients. during the appointment i had invited my other friend over and D said she was fine with it bc she also always has friends over and it‚Äôs both our apartment so I ran it by her and she agreed. my other friend gets there and we start chatting it up. me, my best friend, and my other friend have all known each other since high school so we were talking about HS and just people we knew and D was acting standoffish and weird and i didn‚Äôt think anything of it. a few hours pass and it‚Äôs like 12am-1am and my best friend is like falling asleep in the chair because D has just taken forever to do her hair. she was taking breaks non stop, went to the gas station to get a lighter, not to mention showed up FOUR HOURS late to the appointment and my BF had been awake since 6am so she was exhausted. she finally told D ‚Äúlook you‚Äôre fine with 90% of my hair, i‚Äôll pay you the full amount but i‚Äôm just so exhausted‚Äù and D got irritated by that and told her that she would only make her pay half the total cost and that it was fine. and i could tell she was irritated bc of the look on her face. 

I found out the truth of how D felt about me when I was looking for my phone in the apartment and I grabbed our other roommates phone on accident bc we had the exact same phone and clear case. I saw ALLLL the text messages of them talking shit about me. D texting N calling me and my friends losers and trolls for talking about high school, D telling N i was annoying bc i didn‚Äôt give her a ride to work (she asked me to take her 10 minutes before the shift started and i was dead asleep), purposely making trips and conducting ways to do it in front of me, etc etc. I was baffled but I didn‚Äôt get to see the full extent of everything. 

It wasn‚Äôt until me and D went on a trip together and I knew i needed to get closure. so i looked through D‚Äôs phone. i know that was probably the most toxic thing i‚Äôve done but i needed proof that they were actually talking shit about me and when i read the messages in totality i knew they were not my friends. esp seeing texts of them talking bad about my best friends when they were the one being rude to her. 

Then i had my bday party. long story short they got me plastered because they hyped me up to taking shots for my bday and smoking weed. i was literally wasted and i couldn‚Äôt stand up and instead of helping me, D just said ‚Äúyou need to get up bc im not gonna sit here and baby you while you‚Äôre drunk‚Äù and j literally couldn‚Äôt move so she left me there on the floor passed out and left. it hurt really bad especially bc for our other friends bday when she got drunk D was there consoling her, sitting with her, helped her change into comfy clothes, etc. but didn‚Äôt do anything like that with me. Found out later on that they only wanted to come to my bday party bc i bought all the alcohol but said they wish they would‚Äôve gone to a frat party instead. not to mention they tried to get strangers to take me to bars so that they wouldn‚Äôt have to take care of me. 

I started to notice all the ways that D would give me silent treatment if i disagreed with her or didn‚Äôt give her rides places, she would ignore me when i asked her questions, expect me to apologize for HER wrongs, and eventually she started getting the whole friend group against me. 

After that trip I realized they were not real friends and i started to treat them the same way they treated me. if they did something wrong and expected me to apologize, i refused. if they got mad at me for not giving them rides i ignored them, i gave the same energy back and D acted like I just said the most offensive thing ever. 
She did NOT like that whatsoever and started getting the whole friend group against me even more. 

One of our friends planned an ice skating thing for her bday and she said all the group could go and D quickly said ‚ÄúActually it‚Äôs only going to be 4 instead of 5‚Äù and uninvited me from someone else‚Äôs bday event. later on, they ended up going and that friend just agreed with D. that same day D texted me and told me that if ‚Äúi wasn‚Äôt being so weird maybe i wouldn‚Äôt have gotten uninvited‚Äù which is funny bc I was invited until she took the liberty to uninvite me from someone else‚Äôs event. I called her out and told her she was manipulative and toxic and that no wonder her old roommate moved out and that all her friends end up dropping her bc of the way she treats them. she did NOT like that and started trying to flip the script and act like i was the problem and said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre playing victim and it‚Äôs not cute. it‚Äôs manipulative‚Äù and in my head i‚Äôm like ‚Äúhow can i play victim and be manipulative when i am the victim of your terrible behavior?‚Äù

it spiraled and snowballed into something worse. I ended up isolating myself in my bedroom when she was home, didn‚Äôt talk to her if she was in the same room, would check her location to make sure i could be home freely without her being rude to me. it was a mental torture game and she did everything in her power to make sure the entire friend group stopped talking to me. she 1000% had the mind set of ‚Äúif i don‚Äôt like someone then my friends can‚Äôt like them‚Äù and since the rest of the group was under her spell and her little puppets they all obeyed like little puppies. not a single ounce of individuality in that friend group. 

come christmas time, i found out my family (who are autoimmune compromised) got covid. i was scared and had made a post in instagram asking to keep them in peoples thoughts for safety. not even 20 minutes later D texts me telling me she‚Äôs sorry about my family but I had 5 days to move out and find somewhere else to live or they would call the cops. i told her it was christmas and there was literally no where for me to go because landlords probably aren‚Äôt paying attention to people looking for homes and dorms are closed and she told me it wasn‚Äôt her issue and to figure it out. 

i was stressed to say the least but i managed to find a room in a house pretty quickly since i spent every hour of everyday scouring facebook market. as i was moving out i went to take my things with me and me and N shared a room and had bunk beds. i took them apart because one of the beds was rightfully mine since we paid half and half. D like the little vindictive snake she is, called N‚Äôs MOM and told her i was stealing the bed and that the cops would be called. i told D i would talk to N when she got to the apartment from work and D gave my number to N‚Äôs mom who later texted me saying she would sue me if i took anything from the apartment i didn‚Äôt pay for but i literally paid for the bed. 

N arrived later and we talked and suddenly she wanted to play this ‚Äúi didn‚Äôt know‚Äù victim role when i called her out for talking shit about me and my friends. i told her how would she feel if someone talked shit about her best friend and she agreed she wouldn‚Äôt like it and i basically made her feel stupid for just following along everything D said and not having any sort of thinking for herself. 

I eventually ended up moving out and disconnect from everyone and everything having to do with them. I found out that D went around and told the whole world a whole fabricated story about how i was the problem and i was the bad guy, and i lost all my friends and everyone believed her bc she was more ‚Äúlikeable‚Äù. 

i ended up living in my car for a few days bc i had no where to go and lost all my friends, couldn‚Äôt go home bc my entire family had COVID and i was living off my last paycheck to make ends meet. i struggled a lot and this isn‚Äôt even the full extent of what D and that friend group did to me that was so vile and manipulative and abusive.

D truly was nothing but an abusive, manipulative, toxic, peaked in high school bully and mean girl. she needed to be the center of attention always and be the ‚Äúleader‚Äù of every group she was apart of. if i found other friends she got mad at me and jealous for not being with her. she talked shit ah√≠ it people she didn‚Äôt know and was NEVER happy about any of the success i had in life. 

now it‚Äôs been 5 years and D has texted countless times asking to be my friend again, not taking any accountability when bringing up what happened between us, giving half ass apologies, saying she loves and misses me and constantly stalks my instagram and tiktok accounts. N stalks my accounts too and she‚Äôs gone so downhill, started dating a cheater and dropped out of school‚Ä¶ not good. 

i think it‚Äôs funny seeing how the girl everyone thought was this cool, popular, everyone likes her type of deal is begging for my friendship when she swore she didn‚Äôt need me in her life. but im glad i blocked her and don‚Äôt pay her mind. 

i‚Äôve graduated with my masters, lived in my dream city for three years, am engaged, well traveled, and have the life i have always wanted meanwhile she is still the same mean girl as ever. maybe she‚Äôs changed but she will never be a good person to me. it surprises me how she has so many people fooled that she‚Äôs a good person when she‚Äôs not.

After picking up a passenger, I was prompted to enter a pin. First time for me, but seemed pretty straightforward. I asked them for them for the pin, they provided it and I entered it.

Immediately after entering the pin the ‚ÄúStart Wait and Save‚Äù option you have to slide appeared at the bottom. I slide it to the right as usual and it immediately appeared as if the ride ended. Rate the passenger prompt appeared on the screen, all navigation was gone.

Doing what I know to do when I ride ends, I instructed them they had to exit the vehicle. After a bit of confusion on both of our parts and some back and forth, the passenger showed me their phone and it showed they were still on the ride. So I ended up opening Ways and manually entering the destination. I figured maybe when I get there it‚Äôll correct itself.

Once I had my destination set in Ways, I swapped back over to the Uber Driver app, and attempted to hit the Coffee Cup icon which prompted me with ‚Äúdoing so will cancel the ride‚Äù so I cancelled the Coffee Cup icon action and everything came back.

I wonder if this is a sort of nervous behaviour and if I should even consider a second date, like maybe to gauge if this is her normal or if it was an anxious word vomit situation.


I would consider it a one and done, but she texted me relatively quickly afterwards to tell me how she enjoyed the time together and texted me like usual for a bit before I had to go. Admittedly, sometimes things get by me. I can't get a read on this situation.

Hi there, I had this idea for a while, and I think it could be pretty fun for me to play either sides of this. 

The plot is, there are people who are hybrids of animals that have existed for a long time alongside humans, they are shape shifters of sorts, that can go between a completely human look and a partially animal human look (think kemonomimi‚Äôs). Some people even worshiped them and said that they were true beings of nature, pure and instinctual.

That is until around 1980, when suddenly there was regulations on where the animal people could go, therefore, they had to create their own society, creating their own cities, towns, and animal human explicit areas. All animal people are to be killed on site if found within human borders.

They have created a term for these animal people, beastfolk.

All of this happened because of a presidential election, in which the Supreme Court voted to strip away beastfolk rights. all because of an incident with one in particular, who bit a human.

Now it is 2065, nothing has changed, except for hunters. There are people specifically hired to kill and hunt down beastfolk who may be hiding amongst them. they have futuristic weapons, and the upper hand most of the time.

One of us will be a hunter, and the other one will be a beastfolk. The beastfolk was a coworker of the hunter. Hunters main jobs are to blend in, so therefore they take on different jobs searching for targets. The hunters job currently is a barista job, the beastfolk is the owner of the coffee shop.

Eventually, the Hunter finds out that the coffee shop owner is a beastfolk, but not before they already became close friends.

This is an LGBTQ+ friendly room, I highly encourage anyone who‚Äôs interested in M4M or F4F to reach out! Of course this is A4A so straight relationships are totally fine, I‚Äôm just highly encouraging my fellow LGBTQ+ role players to message me!

Like I said to role-play with me, you must be 18 and up, I‚Äôm 20 so if you are younger than 18, I would feel extremely uncomfortable.

You must talk in third person, as well as either be semi literate, or literate

ABSOLUTELY NO AI.

I was reading this article and it didn't sit well with me, not really as an OPS employee but as a citizen and someone interested in and studied analytics and management/corporate/operational dynamics. I want to preface this by saying I don't intend to slander, belittle, or do anything negative to anyone by this. Happy to debate this, but I just had a bit of time on my hands and felt like writing something. I'm sure the author, Howard Levitt, wrote this with good intentions and is a standup guy overall. Apologies for typos and inconsistencies. I'll probably edit this as time goes on. I only did one draft.

[https://financialpost.com/fp-work/doug-ford-public-sector-workers-back-office#comments-area](https://financialpost.com/fp-work/doug-ford-public-sector-workers-back-office#comments-area)

I went through it and honestly I decided to write a little rebuttal of my own. I am not a professional, just a random anon in the the Reddit aether but I have a free evening and I'm in a writing mood. I also have the luxury of being a bit more informal in my writing and would be able to jump from thought to though more than Howard Levitt, so I probably will be. Overall, I think the article is sloppy, biased, and riddled with errors and incorrect assumptions. Respectfully, I'm sure Howard Levitt is a great lawyer, but a management consultant and futurist, he is not. That being said, please don't sue me, I'm not arguing against character or defamation etc. This is just my retort to his article. I'm just someone with a bit too much time this evening and trying to convince internet people that hybrid/remote work is the best option, quite lazily I may say.

  
Right off the bat he goes to the jugular for CEO's that he believes are too timid to bring people into the office. The rhetoric, while also insulting, is flat out wrong. Many CEO's have figured out that the future of work may require flexibility (ie. hybrid/remote work), they understand that the employees that are the most productive and effective have the option to go elsewhere. I understand that public service may be different as the golden handcuffs of the pension and stability may entice some people to stay, but overall as someone under 30 that has options, departure is a consideration. Regarding the CEO's being timid, I would argue that that may be completely false. Hybrid work has shown to improve productivity more than a full return to office mandate. (See the report issued by CISCO, Stanford, among others). They may also be the ones that can use remote work as a recruitment tactic as young and old workers prefer flexibilty. They also may be the ones that successfully figured out how to fit in Hybrid or Remote work into their day to day operations. The government didn't attempt to figure out procedures and process for remote work, they just left it to the teams to figure themselves out. They offered minimal/no training (in anything... now that I think about it, I had to pay for my training and do it on my own time as my department refused to allocate funds for me) regarding how to succeed in a remote/hybrid environment. Employees figured it out for themselves, and successfully, I might add. I would like to see data arguing the opposite. 

Finally, I would argue that CEO's have more important things to worry about finding a more complex way of working through full RTO strategies. Considering that this is my favourite argument, I would say that Ford must either be doing a great job if he has time to allocate time, talent, and financial resources to complicate things or he is really missing the mark and using RTO as a short term fix for a provincial economy reeling from tariffs.

  
Howard also speaks about common sense, but offers very weak arguments that are not backed by data and once you really start breaking down and shelling out the arguments, I think they really start to fall apart. Mentorship, collaboration, corporate culture, economic revitalization. Also, I'm making the same general assumption that I think Howard is making, we're talking about a full RTO mandate vs fully remote. While I understand that OPS requires employees in 3 days a week, I'm not sure if he does, as I'm getting the understanding through his writing that he assumes we're fully remote (he mentioned Hybrid once in a sentence regarding contract documentation and Remote nine times). So I am gathering his argument is about remote vs in office rather than the true hybrid vs in office.



Mentorship:

Forbes had an interesting article ""Dispelling the office return mandate myth for junior staff success"". Its fairly common sense to realize that forcing mentorship through a forced RTO mandate will not go well. ""The forced return to the office can lead to a disparity in mentoring. The focus groups revealed that the only junior staff receiving mentoring in this ""forced return"" scenario were those with strong initiative and social skills. Unfortunately, this approach leaves those who need mentoring the most - employees lacking social skills and initiative - in the cold. After all, the ones who need mentoring most are the ones without strong initiative and social skills, since mentoring helps develop these soft skills. Moreover, strong social skills often don‚Äôt correlate to the ability to do the technical job well: thus, the ones who do get mentoring are often the ones with great soft skills, but weaker technical skills.""



Collaboration:

Theres an article by the BBC ""the diminishing returns of in office mandates"" that really showed how there is a 1% difference in connections happening in 4-5 days in office vs 2-3. ""In many cases, mandated days fail to account for the natural rhythm of employees' workweeks, says English, creating a disconnect between leadership and workers. ""Sometimes, employees just need heads-down focused time working from home, then have the office as a place to occasionally connect with teams ‚Äì rather than the employer stipulating which days to do what.""""



Corporate Culture

Forbes came out with another banger with ""CEOs think office mandates will improve company culture. New data says they're wrong"".... as I'm reading about how wrong Howard Levitt is in this and his arguments, I just am going to start copying and pasting from the articles as I will let them speak for themselves...

""But as leaders continue to call for the¬†[return to office](https://www.forbes.com/sites/glebtsipursky/2023/01/04/the-four-horsemen-of-the-mandated-return-to-office/?sh=22ab8e84550c), new data shows workers at companies with flexible work policies‚Äîwhere remote work is welcome and employees have the opportunity to go to an office‚Äîsay the compromise is working. Employees with flexible work models¬†[surveyed by Future Forum](https://futureforum.com/research/future-forum-pulse-winter-2022-2023-snapshot/), Slack‚Äôs consortium focused on the future of work, were 57% more likely to say their company culture has improved¬†over the past two years compared to fully in-person workers‚Äîciting flexible work policies as the primary reason their culture is improving.""

  
Economic Revitalization

Offices fuel restaurants, retailers, transit and the tax base. Apparently the data shows that it has a marginal or mixed impact. I would believe that transit revenues would increase, but probably at the cost of the suburban/rural communities (which is common sense). Personal opionion: I can see the banks and more mature companies that have been in the Canadian market for a long time use this as an argument as they are the ones that have a vested interest in the success of commercial real estate. Their investment funds and balance sheets contain these properties. With Ford's reputation, I may also see why he mandated an RTO as well. But regarding OPS employees (who are underpaid relative to the private sector), I don't really see them leading the way to revitalize the downtown economy. I don't see a $1 McDonalds coffee doing much good for anyone. Also, considering the general economy right now, I don't see white collar employees being an economic problem. 

When the mandate first came out I heard a podcast from (I think) the CBC that interviewed a market research team and they said that they found that returning to the office marginally increases foot traffic and not in a very meaningful way. I wish I could find it because, while Howard made a blanket statement, I think its his strongest argument and I can't find my best rebuttal. Someone posted the podcast on Reddit and I thought it was a really good point.

  
Also some nitpicking here....

We had a home office rebate...to build a home office...in an office...not in the living room like Howard says. He throws a lot of bellittling points there which don't really stand much. I understand the narrative/rhetoric he's trying to portray but it just seems like its done in bad taste...it doesn't read well.

He argues that work should be done at work; if thats the case, I would argue that writing should be done by humans...not AI, which my AI detector caught a bit (I'm not saying he did use AI to write his article, I'm just saying my free AI detector caught a bit of his writing and flagged it to me, not much but it did). To me, the article read like an AI, so thats why I went to check. But my point still stands, if hybrid work 

The TRULY bad optics downtown are our homeless crisis. As much as I hate dodging piss and shit on the streets when I walk into the office, I hate the fact that it comes from people that we all neglected to support. Whether we're too busy or tired or too into our own lives etc. to help, I wish the government would support them more than they are, instead of making RTO arguments and mandates that won't help anyone (as a citizen, I want my public servants to be enabled to succeed). I would argue that the commercial building dealers/owners should convert to residential (weak argument as cost vs benefit) if they are so worried about optics.

If work is work, then don't expect many employees who were willing to work after hours and over the weekend while at home to support their teams to make many more concessions like that. Also, I kindly ask Howard to remember his words the next time he works out of his Home Office/Living Room instead of the office.

I understand where he's coming from at the end of the day. He's a lawyer and sees the change in the tide. Employees don't sign and pay big contracts, employers do. I'm guessing he's trying to find that employer that thinks ""I should bring my employees into the office and I want to make sure I can."" Admittedly, the parts of the article where he shines is the legal part...but 1. its his specialty and 2. he basically says employers have the pen on the contract.

Anyways, its late now and this essay is taking time away from my family...just like the Return to Office mandate.

1. Are some of these people homeroasters too? Or just store bought coffee drinkers? 
2. Is this just shilled by the marketing team?
3. Should I throw good money at a bag to try it out? (But I could get 3 lbs of good green beans for the same price.)

After a lot of coaxing from my store-buying friend, I spent $15 bucks on a bag of Counter Culture and came away feeling that at best, it's no better than what I roast.

I do not intend to attack the brands, I'm simply curious if anyone's tried it and how it compares?",0,1758161999.0,roasting,21,0.33,False

Fair deal?,"I wanna thank people in this sub who shared pro tips to help me negotiate price. Got a 25 Sentra (sticker price $27700-ish) with the premium package for $26200 OTD (taxes and fees included). I know I could probably haggle it down even more by another 500-1000 bucks but I guess I was just getting tired of looking at cars. I got everything I wanted: Bose sound system, heated steering wheel and leather seats, all weather package, 360 degree camera, and more. This is so great in today‚Äôs market. (I test drove an entry-level Corolla, which is more like 24000-25000 OTD without all those features. It was honestly disgusting how we are supposed to pay the Toyota tax.)

Pro tips that helped me: 1) remove all those bullshit add-on packages from the sales contract when signing 2) never accept the first offer; reach out to 8-10 different dealers and compare prices 

What‚Äôs funny is that I asked the manager if he could cut down the OTD price to $25700. And he shouted, ‚ÄúYes we could, I guess. but don‚Äôt you think we deserve coffee money? Don‚Äôt you think we deserve your business???‚Äù We all laughed and I yielded.",1,1758161949.0,Nissan,1,0.67,False

The lovemaking is too good. I also love the randomness. I never know what I'm going to get. I have dated an anxious attachment and an avoidant attachment Aquarius and I crave both. Except, I can do without the random, brief temper tantrums ü§™

I love talking an Aquarius' ear off because they sit there listening sooo deeply (or disassociating ha). I love when I talk to them about something they never heard about because you can see their mind processing and calculating. ü´¶ü´¶ü´¶ mmm. 

I love how Aquarius will spoil you and give you anything you desire if they love you. 

I love how Aquarius make time for you in between the pursuit of making money/manifesting stuff lol.

I feel like I can seduce any (single and ready to mingle) Aquarius man because I know how to teach them something new, how to get them to open up about what they're passionate about, and how to have fun üòå... in bed I know exactly how to make an Aquarius tap out and go to sleep sucking their thumb, before I do üòé.

I don't mind my alone time either. But when we come together it's a good ol', kombucha slurping, mushroom coffee sipping, deep body stretching time.

Hi yall, 

I‚Äôm working on getting some furnitures for my apartment. I‚Äôve been living there for months now and don‚Äôt even own chairs. Wanna make it comfy without feeling too cramped. I‚Äôve included a picture of the empty space. It‚Äôs south east facing, painted in white dove. I‚Äôm mostly trying to warm it up cause I hate the grey floors. My main concerns are:

Does the lighter dining table look better than the darker one?

Should I go for the green marble coffee table, the white elliptical table or the black one? 

No rug under the dining table, maybe a round asymmetrical one for the living room? 

Does the couch work? 

But I‚Äôd definitely appreciate tips regarding the whole thing, anything you can think of. For example I‚Äôm not sure what color rugs would go here. Please help!",2,1758161761.0,homedesign,4,1.0,False
