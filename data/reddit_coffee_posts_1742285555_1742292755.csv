Whenever I have free time, especially during holidays, I feel like I have to be worrying about something. The odd thing is, when I‚Äôm at school, I still worry, but not as much. It‚Äôs like my brain can only function if I‚Äôm preoccupied with some sort of problem or goal. I only realized this behavior a week ago, but let me start from the beginning.

About four years ago, when we were still in Pakistan, I got really attached to League of Legends. To be honest, I don‚Äôt think I even liked the game that much. It was more of a burden. It was always like, ‚ÄúOh no, I dropped back to Diamond again.‚Äù But at least it kept my mind off other things, and that‚Äôs what mattered back then. Fast forward a bit to when we moved to Afghanistan. I stopped playing League of Legends and started playing War Thunder. Suddenly, I was obsessing over which tanks to unlock, how many research points I needed, and so on. That became my focus, and that‚Äôs pretty much what I remember from the past few years.

Then, three months ago, winter vacation started, and I stopped playing War Thunder. Instead, I began worrying about which games I should play. I‚Äôd constantly stress over the fact that I hadn‚Äôt finished certain games. It was no longer fun ‚Äì it felt like a burden I had to carry. I‚Äôd spend entire days just stressing, and it felt unbearable. Over that 20-day period, I ended up completing Elden Ring, Blasphemous 1 and 2, Nine Sols, and making a lot of progress in Factorio. I even got over my brief Minecraft phase. But after that, I lost interest in gaming entirely.

Around the same time, I began worrying about my scholarship to China for university next year. Everything was pretty much set ‚Äì I have my passport, and my father has connections with Chinese companies, so the scholarship was basically guaranteed. Still, I couldn‚Äôt stop worrying about it. I spent a lot of time using Google Translate to translate Chinese websites into English and researching the major I want to choose. Thankfully, I got over this worry in about six days, but now the worrying has become really intense.

Right now, I‚Äôm fixated on cheating. For the past three days, I‚Äôve been spending more than 9 hours on Reddit and 2-3 hours on YouTube, reading infidelity stories and listening to music. I hate that I‚Äôm doing this. It feels like I can‚Äôt stop myself from worrying, but when I‚Äôm not worrying about something, I start feeling really suicidal. Even when my life seems perfect and everything is going well, if I don‚Äôt have something to worry about, I just spiral into these dark thoughts.

I actually tried to commit suicide about 2 or 3 years ago during Ramadan. Our school was closed, and I had nothing to do. I felt completely empty and had nothing to focus on. I took 11 packets of instant coffee, mixed them with water, and drank it. My heart felt like it was going to burst. It was one of the worst experiences of my life, and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it to anyone.

Even alcohol doesn‚Äôt help. When I‚Äôm drunk, I feel fine, but once the effects wear off, the worry and anxiety come right back. I don‚Äôt fully understand my emotions, so I can‚Äôt pinpoint why this is happening, but I did read today on Reddit that some people who feel sad and lonely, like myself (I‚Äôm extremely introverted), might be attention-seeking without realizing it. In school, my friends often compliment me on my looks, and they say I‚Äôm attractive, which I enjoy hearing. But when they do, I get extremely uncomfortable. So maybe I‚Äôm seeking attention in some way. When I‚Äôm not getting attention, I end up worrying about something.

One last thing to mention is that I‚Äôm not very religious. I‚Äôm Muslim, but I‚Äôve never genuinely prayed to Allah. I believe Allah exists, but honestly, I just feel like He‚Äôs up there doing nothing while the world suffers. I‚Äôm aware that I‚Äôm probably heading for hell when I die, but I don‚Äôt care.

I‚Äôd really appreciate any advice or if anyone has gone through something similar and how you managed to deal with it. It‚Äôs hard for me to break this cycle of constant worrying, and I‚Äôm honestly just trying to figure out how to stop.

1je0v39,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/1je0v39/is_is_illegal_to_be_naked_in_your_own_garden/,Is is illegal to be naked in your own garden? England,"We bought our house 15 years ago and 11 year ago installed a hot-tub and patio area in a private area of the garden.  My morning routine ever since is that I wake up, make a coffee and go and sit in the patio area to drink it in my dressing gown.  If the weather is nice enough and the mood takes me, I will de-robe and jump in the tub for 20 minutes, au naturel, before heading back in to shower and getting on with the day. 

This was my morning routine for 8 years, until 3 years ago, someone bought the small parcel of land behind our house and applied for planning permission to build a house.  We objected as strongly as we could to this because the rear aspect of the new house had skylight windows looking towards our 'private' hot-tub area.  The planning officer agreed with our right to privacy and required the plans to be updated to include a line of screening trees between the two properties - they are detailed on the subsequent plans as such: ""trees for privacy screening to neighbouring property"".

So far so good, except that when the new house was finished, there was a distinct lack of trees.  We raised this to the builder/owner who took us round to show us the trees were there, they were just so small they didn't yet reach above the fence-line.  It was clear it was going to take 10-15 years for these trees to actually provide any sort of screening. So we engaged the council again who sent the planning officer round.  She eventually came to us and said that she wasn't going to require the builder to replace the trees because they had convinced her that these trees were the largest they could reasonably install at the time and, she said, in any case she'd been up to the attic rooms and that in order to see into our patio you actually had to be 'standing on a box with your head in the top corner of the sky-light recess'.  We weren't happy, but we relented to just get on with our lives. 

Once again things were OK and I got on with my morning routine, though for the sake of my own dignity, I now carefully de-robe facing away from the neighbours skylights so the most they might see if being curious was my bare arse.  This went on fine until the neighbours sold their house 9 months ago.  Our new neighbours must be curtain twitchers because almost immediately they came round to complain that they'd seen me naked from the window of 'their daughters room' and they were not happy about it. I relayed the whole story to him and how you can only see this if you're standing in the window and we reached an impasse.  It seemed to die down and life went on.  Until a few weeks ago, when the neighbour came round again to say his daughter (teenage) has seen me naked in the garden and was 'upset'.  I told him pretty bluntly that I wasn't going to change my routine of 11 years just because someone built a house behind ours and perhaps he should tell his daughter to stop peeping out the window because you have to be watching from a pretty specific un-natural position to be able to see this.  This led to a pretty heated exchange with him then threatening to report me to the police if it happened again. 

I realise I'm being a little stubborn, but there is a small but life-style significant difference between jumping in the hot-tub on a whim in nice weather vs. planning to get in and changing into swimwear and having to dry them out afterwards etc (which I do if we ever have guests around!).  I'm not parading around naked and you can't see 'into' the tub from the windows, so it's literally the 5-10 seconds it takes me to take my robe off and step into the tub. 

Where do I stand legally?  Firstly, is this a criminal matter and what would happen if he did report it to the police?  Secondly if it's a civil matter, what can they do?",129,1742289558.0,LegalAdviceUK,125,0.9,False

# Why Online Survey Sites Matter

[Online](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/)¬†[survey sites](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/)¬†give people a way to make a bit of extra money by sharing their opinions.

In Latvia, like in many countries, these sites allow anyone with a computer or smartphone and an internet connection to earn¬†[rewards](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/)¬†or cash.

With many people looking for side gigs or small ways to supplement their income,¬†[online](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/)¬†[surveys](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/)¬†have become a popular option.

I‚Äôve found that¬†[survey sites](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/)¬†offer a flexible opportunity. You can fit¬†[surveys](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/)¬†into your day without major disruptions to your routine.

Some people take¬†[surveys](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/)¬†while having a coffee break or waiting for a friend, making it an easy option for anyone.

Many¬†[survey sites](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/)¬†provide instant¬†[rewards](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/), such as gift cards or cash via¬†[PayPal](https://tchelete.com/how-to-make-money-online-with-paypal/). Even if the pay is modest, every little bit helps when it comes to¬†[extra income](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/).

# How Survey Sites Work

The process is simple. You sign up on a survey site and complete a profile so the site can match you with¬†[surveys](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/)¬†that suit your background and interests.

Once you receive survey invitations, you answer a series of questions on products, services, or trends.

After you finish a survey, you receive points or cash that add up over time. When you reach a set threshold, you can redeem your¬†[rewards](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/).

Most¬†[survey sites](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/)¬†have a user-friendly design. I‚Äôve noticed that clear instructions and an easy layout help people feel comfortable and get started without hassle.

Some platforms even send regular email updates, so you never miss out on new¬†[surveys](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/).

A few reliable sites even let you earn bonus points for referring friends or completing daily challenges.

# Top Survey Sites for Latvia

After trying out several sites and doing some research, here are a few that I believe work well for people in Latvia:

Dex caused headaches so psychiatrist moved me to vyvanse, hoping a long acting med would work better for my brain I guess.

I took the first dose today. I'm only now reading that this is the kind of medication im meant to take every day.. I didn't even realise that. I'm not sure I want to be taking this every day - I liked with Dex I could pick and choose and usually I wouldn't have it on weekends. 

Am I locked in? How bad is it to miss doses? I read nothing about withdrawal effects on the pamphlet but people do say there's effects. I'm also worried about how long it's lasting... Took at 8am today and still feel it at 8pm. Please don't make my sleep worse than it already is :(

I'm also concerned about alcohol and cannibis and coffee mixing with it, considering it's now a daily tablet. I enjoy these things and didn't expect this. 

Any advice or anecdotes appreciated. My psychiatrist is kind and approachable but really skimps on the details and seems to not be taking everything into account, such as my weed use for example. I read most psychiatrists wouldn't prescribe any meds with weed use. My paychiatrist listened as I said how often I use, and then he never mentioned it again.

Also I've found these help focus but I still procrastinate and avoid things - are these meds mainly for the focus and hyperactivity and impulse control?

A lot of these threads are super long and difficult to get into, especially for non-members. Thus, I created [ThreadsInside](https://www.threadsinside.com). It curates engaging threads and turns them into bite-sized audio and podcasts.

Happy to buy you a coffee or wine for your time.

1je0hia,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1je0hia/zp6_bitterness/,Zp6 bitterness," Hi everyone, I recently got a Zp6 and had some trouble with the first cup I made with it. I seasoned the burrs with around 400g of coffee first. Then 1:16 with 16 g at 5.5 with a bloom of 50g with a closed switch then open at 45s and pour at 55s until final weight is achieved. I did very little agitation and used the right water and water temperature around 90-95 degrees C. Do you know what the issue might be? What should I tweak to avoid bitterness in the final cup?",1,1742287803.0,pourover,4,0.67,False
1je0gkn,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/1je0gkn/question_splenda_stevia_powder_experiences_is_it/,QUESTION: Splenda Stevia Powder Experiences?  Is it Safe?,"Hello,

Does anyone have experience with Splenda Stevia Powder?  Any issues with blood sugar/insulin spikes?   I'm not diabetic so I don't monitor my blood sugar but being high risk I care a lot and monitor my carb consumption closely.    Really hoping someone who's used this product who can monitor their blood sugar could weigh in. 

Splenda Stevia Powder's ingredients are maltodextrin mixed with stevia.  Since maltodextrin is actually a sugar and not a sweetener that's obviously cause for concern.   But the dose makes the poison.  I can't tell if it's enough Maltodextrin to trigger a GI spike or if it's just enough to help boost the stevia's taste and add some density and weight.    The website claims it's a diabetic safe product. If it can trigger a GI response is it a big spike?    
  
I was baking with this stuff and using it in my coffee a lot until I learned that maltodextrin is basically sugar on steroids.   I know there's plenty alternatives but this Stevia Splenda ""sweetener"" is my favourite, and cheaply available.  If I have to let it go for safety and health I will.  But I'm sincerely hoping r/diabetes can be of help!   Thank you!

1je0fw0,https://www.reddit.com/r/masseffect/comments/1je0fw0/whats_the_hurry/,What's the hurry?,"Maybe I don't get it, because I'm not an American and I can't relate to your ""hustle culture"", but I personally enjoy beating around the bush and taking my time to enjoy the games and all their features. Like planet scanning, puzzles and side quests and loyalty missions. 

I've seen a lot of people complain about puzzles and planet scanning taking time away from ""actual gameplay"", but why is that a problem? And by ""actual gameplay"" I assume you mean shooting enemies, which is pretty much all you do all the time. Like, I prefer to accept those as part of the gameplay. 

And not liking planet scanning and puzzles I can understand(they get annoying ever for me after the 100th time), but some people even dislike the loyalty missions and sometimes even skip them, like what's the hurry? Why are you so eager to go straight to the point and finish the game, instead of taking your time to enjoy it? 

Feel free to disagree, but I'm just stating my opinion. I like to experience my games as I experience my coffee and meals. Not in a hurry, taking my time to enjoy them...like a cup of espresso coffee you sit down to enjoy at home, rather than one of those watered down carton cups Americans take in their cars on the way to work...or eating a sandwich/burger as quickly as possible because you have no time, as if someone is chasing you.

1je0d7w,https://www.reddit.com/r/scaryjujuarmy/comments/1je0d7w/theres_something_out_there_in_the_storm_pt_24/,There's Something Out There in the Storm [pt. 2/4],"When we finally returned to base, I parked the plow in the shed. The others were still on their way back, chattering over the radio about updates on the storm and the corpse they‚Äôd found. Killing the engine, their voices fell silent.

The commander and I headed inside, stripping our excess gear in the locker room before continuing to his office. The compound, while larger than Outpost Delta‚Äôs cabins, was most likely constructed on a similar budget. Crude floorboards with sections of ceramic tile in the bathrooms and kitchen. Narrow hallways to the north and south of the building with sleeping quarters, a communication center, and medical bay tacked onto them. At the center, perhaps the largest section, was the common room. It was populated by bookshelves, a flatscreen TV that didn‚Äôt work, a dining area, lounge chairs, two couches, an air hockey table in which one of the paddles was missing, and a pool table. There was a second building with a lab where all of the eggheads worked, but they had all been granted temporary leave for the holidays while we were to remain and keep the central base active.

The buildings were well-insulated. Possibly the most expensive cost during initial construction if you didn‚Äôt include our equipment and gear. As a result, if the bases didn‚Äôt reek of chemicals and cleansers, they usually smelled like last night‚Äôs dinner. Since it was Ludwig‚Äôs week for cooking, there was a lingering odor of canola oil and fried meat.

We exited the locker room and headed for the northern hallway. At the end of the corridor was the armory where I disposed of my rifle and ammunition. The commander, as usual, retained his revolver. Possibly out of forgetfulness, but more than likely, out of habit. Unlike the rest of us, it wasn‚Äôt unusual for him to keep his firearm whether it was deemed necessary or not. It may as well had been surgically attached to him.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve gotta turn up the ventilation,‚Äù the commander muttered as we stepped into his office. ‚ÄúI can practically taste sausage.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll make sure it gets done, sir,‚Äù I said, connecting the hard drive to his computer.

While he sat there reading Emma‚Äôs final document, the others came into the compound, shivering from the cold and complaining. They stamped snow from their boots and removed their coats, putting them on hangers in their lockers. Ludwig took his samples into the medical bay for safe-keeping, Javier not far behind talking about what they should do for the remainder of the night. Ludwig proposed a game of snooker and some drinks to help stave off the cold. This seemed to entice the others with only Arianna resigning herself to spectate. Unless it was a board game or movie, she didn‚Äôt care to participate in their antics. I couldn't blame her.

Watching them go about their usual activities relieved me though. It was better to have them distracted than panicking. Although, I imagined the panic would ensue once the commander had finished the document. Once they started to converse amongst themselves about what happened in the outskirts.

Until then, I closed the door to the commander‚Äôs quarters and locked it, taking a seat across the room, patiently waiting for him to finish.

This moment arrived when the commander remarked: ‚ÄúFuckin‚Äô hell.‚Äù He tapped at the arrow keys to scroll back up to the top of the document. ‚ÄúYou think this is real?‚Äù

‚ÄúI believe so, sir.‚Äù I shifted uncomfortably in my seat, reimagining the story‚Äôs events as they unfolded in my thoughts. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs enough evidence to support it.‚Äù

He stared at the monitor, his eyes moving across the screen as he re-read the first few passages. The matchstick between his teeth bobbed with his flexing jaw. A vein throbbed on his forehead, bulging against the skin.

‚ÄúAliens,‚Äù he said in disbelief. Almost disgusted. ‚ÄúGive me a fuckin‚Äô break.‚Äù

‚ÄúForeign entity,‚Äù I amended, not that it sounded much better. ‚ÄúSingular, as far as I‚Äôm aware.‚Äù

‚ÄúInfects the mind, takes control of the host, sounds like absolute rubbish to me.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you really believe that, then why don‚Äôt we head back out and continue digging?‚Äù I proposed, hoping the commander wasn‚Äôt so witless as to accept my bluff. ‚ÄúSee for ourselves what'sactually out there.‚Äù

He scoffed and pushed away from his desk, standing and crossing the room to a cabinet in the back. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tempt me, Sonya. I‚Äôll send you personally if that‚Äôs what you want.‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry, sir. I was just trying to make a point.‚Äù

‚ÄúPoint well-received, yeah.‚Äù

He dug through the cabinet and removed a whiskey bottle from his personal stash. He angled the bottle towards me, but I refused with a shake of my head.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably best if we don‚Äôt share food or drinks.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre already breathin‚Äô the same air, Sonya. We were all there; all exposed.‚Äù

‚ÄúStill, we‚Äôre not entirely sure how this thing operates. Whether it can pass from one host to the next, or if the infection has to come directly from the source. We also don‚Äôt know the range of exposure.‚Äù

Unscrewing the cap, he took a drink and exhaled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd kill for a smoke right now.‚Äù

‚ÄúPretty sure Ludwig might have some,‚Äù I offered, which was comical considering his position amongst the team. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd recommend it though.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight, minimizing contact and all that.‚Äù He raised his hand and rubbed at his bald head. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs our next move then?‚Äù

I‚Äôd wondered when this would come about. Furtively, I‚Äôd been dreading it ever since the drive back.

‚ÄúWay I see it, we have a couple of options,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWe can tell the American company about the entity, about what happened to their skeleton crew, but‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúBut then we risk their curiosity. That they might send a team for closer examination. Inquisitive bastards. What else?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe can lie and say they died from natural causes.‚Äù

‚ÄúA fickle lie at best, and they‚Äôd still send someone to investigate. We‚Äôre short on time here. Americans want a response sooner rather than later. Not to mention, the rest of their crew will be returning after the holiday. Which poses another risk of infection.‚Äù He drank again, biting against the burn of the whiskey. ‚ÄúYou know they‚Äôd go diggin‚Äô if they found out about it. Can‚Äôt leave well-enough alone, can they? Just have to have an answer. Have to poke and prod and see it all for themselves.‚Äù

I suddenly wished I‚Äôd taken the commander‚Äôs offer for a drink. Something to help alleviate the tension polluting my body.

‚ÄúWe should tell them our search was interrupted by the storm,‚Äù I suggested. ‚ÄúThat we can resume in the morning, once the storm has passed. That‚Äôll at least buy us a little time.‚Äù

He took another drink and grimaced. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like it, but it‚Äôs the best we can do for now. Radio Command and tell Them exactly that. See if the Americans will grant us an extension. But come tomorrow, they‚Äôll be wantin‚Äô answers. Somethin‚Äô concrete, and if we don‚Äôt have it, they‚Äôll send a team in.‚Äù

I nodded. ‚ÄúAnd the entity? What do you propose we do about that, sir?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, for now it‚Äôs buried, but there‚Äôs no sayin‚Äô how much good that‚Äôll do us.‚Äù He set the bottle on his desk and rubbed at his eyes. ‚ÄúChrist, we‚Äôre up against a wall here.‚Äù He glanced out the nearest window as curtains of snow came down thick. ‚ÄúStorm‚Äôs heavy right now. No goin‚Äô out in that. Tomorrow, we should‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúShould what, sir?‚Äù

He blinked. ‚ÄúHow much petrol do we have in storage?‚Äù

‚ÄúFew canisters,‚Äù I answered. ‚ÄúSupposed to get more during our next supply shipment.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight. Well, I say we try to burn the damn thing.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù

He stared at me with a furrowed brow, bemused. ‚ÄúGrowin‚Äô sympathetic, are we? You read that document same as me. This thing, whatever It is, can manipulate our minds. It made someone disappear, made another pop like a balloon.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut only after It was provoked.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs dangerous, Sonya. No two ways about it. You know this, otherwise you wouldn‚Äôt have stopped us from diggin‚Äô the damn thing up.‚Äù

I flinched against his harsh inflection. ‚ÄúNo, I-I know, sir. I just wanted to make sure you were certain because if we go out there tomorrow with intent to kill, and we fail, that‚Äôs it for us.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd if we sit around waitin‚Äô for someone else to stumble upon It, we might as well consign ourselves to death. Maybe worse. Imagine what someone could do with a critter like that.‚Äù He leaned back in his seat and looked up at the ceiling. ‚ÄúWhen I was in the service, we would sometimes find IEDs just in the streets. We didn‚Äôt bury them and hope nothin‚Äô would happen. We‚Äôd dispose of them proper. No matter the risks.""

‚ÄúSorry, sir. I just wanted to consider all angles before we make any decisions.‚Äù

The air between us turned sour. The commander continued drinking from the bottle and chewing on his matchstick. The look in his eyes wishing it was a cigarette instead.

‚ÄúTell me somethin‚Äô, Sonya,‚Äù he said, attempting to help dispel the awkwardness lingering between us. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been workin‚Äô together almost a year now, yeah?‚Äù

‚ÄúGive or take, sir.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight, give or take.‚Äù He chuckled to himself. ‚ÄúWhat made you come out here?‚Äù

I paused a moment, sometimes wondering the very same thing while lying in my bed late at night. ‚ÄúI guess I needed to get away.‚Äù

‚ÄúAway from what?‚Äù

‚ÄúPeople, society.‚Äù My fingers drummed against the arm of my chair. ‚ÄúI spent so much of my life with this plan, you know? Go to school, get good grades, find a stable career, settle down. That sort of thing. But about halfway through university, I realized how much I hated school. My grades, while decent, didn‚Äôt really mean anything. And that job was just wishful thinking because no matter where I went or how long I worked there, it never really made me happy.‚Äù

A soft smile crossed his lips. ‚ÄúAnd does this? Does being out here make you happy?‚Äù

I shook my head solemnly. ‚ÄúFar as I can tell, nothing does. Not really. I just follow routine; get through the days.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt we all?‚Äù

‚ÄúSometimes, if I‚Äôm being honest, I‚Äôm not really sure who I am or what I‚Äôm doing. I tried to do it their way. Tried the nine-to-five and all that. But I just didn‚Äôt fit in with the natural ebb and flow of society. Always felt like I was swimming against the current. So, when I heard about this job, I figured I‚Äôd give it a go. See what happened. Maybe a little time away would sort me out.‚Äù

His eyebrows raised curiously. ‚ÄúAnd?‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm still at square one. Still have no clue. Life just happens, and I‚Äôm there to endure it.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre so good at followin‚Äô orders.‚Äù He ruminated over this and scoffed. ‚ÄúCould teach the others a thing or two, I imagine.‚Äù Then, in a softer tone, he said: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre young yet, Sonya. That battle you‚Äôre fightin‚Äô, we all do it at some point or another. Me against me, you against you. That sort of thing. But how do you fight an enemy you know nothin‚Äô about? Boggles the mind, don‚Äôt it?‚Äù

If the commander would‚Äôve offered me a drink then, I don‚Äôt think I would‚Äôve refused again. But he didn‚Äôt. Instead, he kept the bottle to himself, cradled in his lap. He pulled the matchstick from his mouth and tossed it into a nearby trash bin, replacing it with another from the box he kept in his breast pocket.

‚ÄúSince you‚Äôre such a wellspring of wisdom,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúdo you have any advice?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt sign up for the Army hoping that it‚Äôll solve all your problems.‚Äù He laughed to himself and stood from the chair. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll teach you discipline, give you structure. But I‚Äôm not gonna promise it‚Äôll make you happy.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks‚Ä¶I guess.‚Äù

He looked down at me, the usual edge of his gaze dulled by the whiskey. ‚ÄúYou want somethin‚Äô honest? Don't let it weigh on you. It's just static. Noise, Sonya. That's all. You've gotta find a way to tune it out. Once you step up and take charge of your life, things will get better. Not easier, it doesn‚Äôt ever get easier, but you figure out how to carry that weight instead of struggling beneath it.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù I said, meaning it this time.

‚ÄúAlright, radio Command and give them the message for the American company. Tell them what you will to get us more time. For now, this stays between us. The rest are on a need-to-know basis, do you understand?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù

‚ÄúI want you to monitor the rest of the crew. See if any of them show symptoms of infection. Confusion, disorientation, memory loss, unusual quietness. That last should be rather easy to spot with some of ‚Äòem. Once we‚Äôre in the clear, we‚Äôll divulge what we know and head out to take care of this.‚Äù

I rose from my seat. ‚ÄúTo be safe, we should probably maintain a distance from each other. Prepare our own meals and refrain from sharing drinks.‚Äù

‚ÄúI see where you‚Äôre comin‚Äô from, but if we do that, they‚Äôll only get more suspicious. We need to be careful about how we proceed. Last thing we want is to incite panic.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot telling them is going to do just that.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut if we tell ‚Äòem, there‚Äôs no saying how they might react. One way or the other, it‚Äôll be a long night. Let them remain blissfully ignorant for the time being. That way, they don‚Äôt feel pressured to act a certain way. Should make observing them a lot easier.‚Äù

While I couldn‚Äôt necessarily agree with the commander‚Äôs methods, it wasn‚Äôt my place to further question him or negate any of his decisions. There was a reason he‚Äôd been put in charge, and love it or hate it, I had my orders.

‚ÄúI trust you can take it from here then?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll do what I can, sir.‚Äù

At the same time, I had to wonder how close the commander had gotten to the foreigner. Whether he‚Äôd been within its contamination radius. Hell, I had to wonder the same about myself. There was no saying how expansive its reach went. If Emma‚Äôs log was any indication, it could instigate hallucinations and delusions from a miles away. Could distort a person‚Äôs reality even while buried beneath a thick layer of ice and snow. There just wasn‚Äôt enough data present to fully comprehend its abilities. Wasn‚Äôt enough to understand the risks or dangers it posed.

I exited the commander‚Äôs quarters and walked down the hall to the common room where the others were in the midst of a game of pool. It was Benny against Javier while Arianna fingered through pages of the Bible. I didn't know how much good it would do her, but if it gave her some kind of solace, I wasn't going to interfere. As I entered the room, they stopped what they were doing and looked at me. Their eyes wide, faces absent of emotion. Seconds passed, them staring at me and me staring at them.

I exhaled and said: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let me stop you. Looks like Benny‚Äôs got you against the ropes again.‚Äù

Javier snorted. ‚ÄúHe wishes.‚Äù Then, he sunk one of the striped balls in the corner pocket and celebrated with a beer. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a dead-eye, g√ºey. Never miss a shot.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve scratched almost six times now,‚Äù Arianna muttered beneath her breath, returning to her scriptures.

‚ÄúIf you can keep that up,‚Äù Benny said to Javier, ‚ÄúI might actually have to try for once.‚Äù

‚ÄúI see you sweatin‚Äô over there, Benji,‚Äù he replied. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt even keep the cue straight.‚Äù

Benny chalked his stick and mumbled beneath his breath: ‚ÄúKeep talkin‚Äô, see what happens.‚Äù

He lifted his hand to his tousled hair, trying to comb the thick locks out of his eyes to no avail. Benny had what we called, permanent bedhead. His shaggy beard giving him the appearance of a stereotypical lumberjack.

""I'm gonna send you runnin' home to mommy,"" Javier joked.

At this, Benny clenched his jaw. ""Just take your next shot already.""

And like that, they'd forgotten all about me. That was one fire put out, and I had a feeling that the remainder of my night would be spent performing this same conversational maneuver to make sure no others would spring up. Affecting a level of nonchalance to keep everyone else pacified and unsuspecting. At least, until the commander deemed it safe enough to tell them.

A few seconds later, Ludwig came out from the kitchen with a bowl of dip and a couple bags of chips. There was talk about getting dinner ready soon, but this small treat was meant to tide us over until then. Again, I abstained.

He set the bowl on the table and opened the chips. The others broke from their game and joined him. I watched silently as they passed the chips around, all digging into the dip without pause. Then, Benny started pouring shots for everyone as a means of passing the time. Like I said, you had to make your own entertainment.

""Sonya?"" he asked.

""I'm good,"" I said, stifling the scream lodged in my throat.

I slipped past them and headed down the opposite hall into the radio room. I contacted our superiors and told them we would need more time to investigate since we were interrupted by the storm. They told me they would pass the message to the American company and respond later with any further updates or instructions. I thought about telling them the truth, about asking for reinforcements, but it dawned on me that the more people we involved, the chance of infection only increased. We had to isolate, at least until we knew more.

After that, I went into my room and placed Emma‚Äôs hard drive in the top shelf of my dresser. I don‚Äôt know why, but I liked the idea of having it close. As if it meant something for me to have it. As if it somehow gave me importance.

For the rest of the night, the others alternated between board games and rounds of pool. They drank and chatted, laughed on occasion. Supper never came. Instead, they snacked on chips and other prepackaged foods which was preferable in given circumstances.

To them, it was just any other weekend. A grace period between holidays where the expectation for work was relatively low. Not that we were able to accomplish much without the other half of our team.

At some point, Ludwig turned to me and asked: ‚ÄúWhat was the deal earlier? With that stuff at the American base?‚Äù

I searched for a plausible answer, glad Arianna hadn‚Äôt told them about the possibility of contamination. Maybe it had slipped her mind, or maybe she didn‚Äôt want to be the brunt for their questions. Either way, it made easier for me to fabricate a story from scratch than try to mold one from any details she might've given them.

‚ÄúI, uh, found some entry logs from one of the cabins,‚Äù I explained, trying to conceive something plausible. ‚ÄúThey noted a possible biohazard in the area.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat kind of biohazard?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt specify, but I thought it might pose a danger if we stuck around. Probably better to just leave it alone. Let the American company deal with it instead.‚Äù

‚ÄúWas it flammable or something?‚Äù Javier asked, leaning across the pool table to take his next shot. ‚ÄúBecause we found some human remains. Looked like they‚Äôd been burnt.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt believe so. From what I could gather, the analysts were trying to secure the area, and they encountered issues along the way.‚Äù

‚ÄúIssues? That guy was charred to a crisp.‚Äù

Before I could answer, Ludwig interjected with: ‚ÄúWait a minute, what kind of biohazard are we talking about?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure exactly,‚Äù I confessed. ‚ÄúThe records were vague. I think the analysts were still in the process of collecting samples and testing.‚Äù

‚ÄúWas it some kind of fungus?‚Äù Javier asked. ‚ÄúDo you think we‚Äôll be okay? I mean, we were all in the vicinity of it, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unclear,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI talked it over with the commander. He‚Äôs still trying to figure out our next steps. But I‚Äôm sure once he has an answer, he‚Äôll share it with the rest of us.‚Äù

Benny set his pool cue down on the table. ‚ÄúShould I take a shower?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou shower?‚Äù Javier remarked. ‚ÄúSince when?‚Äù

‚ÄúCalm down,‚Äù I cut in before the situation could spiral any further. ‚ÄúIt was probably nothing. I overreacted earlier because I was afraid‚Ä¶uh‚Ä¶that we‚Äôd get in some kind of trouble for interfering with the American‚Äôs research. The bureaucrats get really worked up about stuff like this, especially when it comes to new discoveries.‚Äù

‚ÄúStill,‚Äù said Ludwig, ‚Äúwe should have done more to preserve the scene. We left a body out there in the storm.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know, and I apologize. I wasn‚Äôt thinking straight. I jumped the gun, and the commander already gave me a stern talking to. We‚Äôll probably head out again tomorrow to clean up the mess and further assess the situation.‚Äù

I was met by a sea of dubious stares. If I were them, I wouldn‚Äôt believe me either. Not completely. But I was just the mouthpiece. If they wanted answers, they‚Äôd have to take their concerns to the commander, and he wasn‚Äôt always the most approachable person.

‚ÄúWell, I have some tissue samples from the corpse,‚Äù Ludwig said. ‚ÄúI can perform a few tests and see what comes back.‚Äù

‚ÄúI would wait and see what the commander wants us to do.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know he‚Äôs our superior,‚Äù Javier said, ‚Äúnot God, right?‚Äù

I suppressed my irritation. ‚ÄúI know. I‚Äôm just trying to be professional about this.‚Äù

Ludwig narrowed his eyes, a groove forming across his forehead. ‚ÄúWhat are you not telling us?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm telling you everything I know.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think you are full of shit. I can see it in your eyes. You are acting strange tonight.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre more than welcome to ask the commander yourself.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat is the point? He won‚Äôt tell us anything. You have always been his favorite. His proud little puppy dog.‚Äù

My cheeks flushed, and I could feel the heat radiating from my face. ‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôm just better at following orders.‚Äù

‚ÄúBetter at not asking questions maybe,‚Äù Javier offered in a casual manner.

‚ÄúHey, let‚Äôs all take a second to breathe,‚Äù Benny suggested. ‚ÄúIf there was a problem, the commander would tell us himself. Plus, we were all wearing insulated gear.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat does not help us against airborne pathogens,‚Äù Ludwig countered. ‚ÄúIf there was a biohazard, we would most likely have been exposed.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe were wearing face masks though.‚Äù

‚ÄúBalaclavas are not medical-grade. They‚Äôre meant to protect you against the cold, not viruses.‚Äù

Benny, teetering between buzzed and intoxicated, raised his hands in surrender and mumbled a fake apology. Then, he tapped the table with his hand to get Javier‚Äôs attention. ‚ÄúYou gonna take your turn or what?‚Äù

Tentatively, Javier angled the stick and rammed the cue ball. There was a loud crack as the other balls bounced against each other, rebounding off the inner lip of the table. They came to a gradual standstill, the room falling silent in response.

Ludwig looked me up and down. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre infected with something, aren‚Äôt we?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I lied. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

‚ÄúBullshit. You think I haven't noticed the way you have been watching us. What did the commander put you up to?‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt lie to me, Sonya!‚Äù His expression was taut and cold as steel. ‚ÄúWhat aren‚Äôt you telling us?‚Äù A moment of silence passed as I wracked my brain for a response. He stepped forward: ‚ÄúWhat is going on!‚Äù

I reached for the rifle that wasn‚Äôt there. The one that I had locked up in the armory with the rest of the firearms. It was an instinctual reaction, one I‚Äôd grown quite accustomed to during those excursions with my brother, where a snap of twigs from the forest could mean anything. Could be a bird taking to the sky, a rabbit running across the ground, or a grizzly bear about to invade our camp.

And while I tried to play it off as if I was just stretching, Ludwig took notice. His face hardened. Behind him, Benny and Javier set their pool cues on the table and took a step back. Arianna quietly closed her book and placed it on the coffee table. She hunkered lower into her seat as if to take cover.

Then, Ludwig barrelled past, shouldering me aside as he darted down the northern hallway. Once I had regained my balance, I gave chase, catching up quickly and crashing into his side. He bounced off the wall and fell to the floor. Before I could further pursue, Javier was behind me, maneuvering his arms under mine, attempting to put me into a Full Nelson. I swung my head back against his face. There was an audible crunch of his nose, and he yelled out in pain. His arms went slack around me, and I slipped free.

By then, Ludwig had returned to his feet, stumbling down the hall towards the armory. I leapt onto his back, wrapping my legs about his waist and trying to secure my arms around his throat.

We teetered from side-to-side, falling against the wall before collapsing to the ground. My head slammed against the floorboards, and my vision rippled like a stone on water.

There was yelling and screaming, but I couldn‚Äôt tell who or where it was coming from. Maybe it was just my imagination. I don‚Äôt know. Before I could try to figure it out, I was already crawling across the floor after Ludwig. Just as I extended my hand to grab him, Javier  had me by the ankle and started dragging me away. I began to flail and kick in response, my defense mechanisms not so different from those of a child in the midst of a tantrum.

Benny came in to break us up, grabbing Javier by the collar of his shirt and pulling him off me. They wrestled against each other, awkwardly skittering around the hallway as neither could outright overpower the other despite Benny‚Äôs larger frame. It seemed all that booze had dulled his senses.

I turned away from them, watching Ludwig scramble to his feet again. His left foot dragged, injured from the previous skirmish.

Climbing to my hands and knees, I pounced at him, hooking my arms around his legs. Thrown off balance, he dropped on top of me. My teeth came together hard, clamping down against the inside of my cheek. The distinct metallic tinge of blood washed over my tongue.

‚ÄúWhat are you hiding?‚Äù Ludwig yelled, trying to push me away. ‚ÄúWhat aren‚Äôt you telling us?‚Äù

‚ÄúI already told you everything I know!‚Äù I returned, a horrible lie said with more conviction than I felt.

‚ÄúBullshit!‚Äù

There was a sharp click, and everything came to a standstill. Slowly, I raised my head, staring down the barrel of the commander‚Äôs revolver. It drifted towards Ludwig, then rose to face Benny before settling its sights on Javier.

‚ÄúSomethin‚Äô we need to discuss?‚Äù the commander asked, gesturing with his gun for us to stand up.

Ludwig shoved me away and returned to his feet. I wiped the blood from my lips, and with Benny‚Äôs help, stood. Glancing over my shoulder, I saw Javier sporting a fresh bruise on his cheek, and he refused to meet my gaze.

‚ÄúWho would like to go first?‚Äù Commander Kimball asked.

Ludwig wasted no time at all. ‚ÄúWhat the hell is going on?‚Äù

The commander frowned. ‚ÄúI need you to lower your voice and be a little more specific.‚Äù

Ludwig was successful in only one of these demands. ‚ÄúSir, what did we find out there?‚Äù

Even as I stared at the floor, I could feel the weight of the commander‚Äôs eyes on me. I had failed to uphold my orders. Whether this was a subconscious blunder or a furtively intentional one remained a mystery to me. Either way, I won't lie and say I didn't experience some modicum of relief at no longer having to keep it a secret.

‚ÄúYou wanna know?‚Äù the commander asked. ‚ÄúYou really wanna know? Alright, fine. Sonya discovered a document in one of the American‚Äôs cabins, Emma of Outpost Delta. This document detailed an unusual finding‚Ä¶a foreign entity.‚Äù

‚ÄúForeign entity?‚Äù Javier remarked. ‚ÄúLike an alien.‚Äù

The commander grinned. ‚ÄúSomethin‚Äô like that, yeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúBullshit,‚Äù came Ludwig. I think that might‚Äôve been a recent addition to his vocabulary, or maybe it was a new catchphrase. ‚ÄúWhat was it really?‚Äù

The commander shrugged. ‚ÄúAs far as we know, it‚Äôs exactly that. This thing, whatever It is, has the ability to infect others, to manipulate their memories, incite hallucinations, and distort their thoughts. There isn‚Äôt much else we know about It, honestly. The encounter, while disturbing, was brief. Provoking more questions than supplying answers.‚Äù

He continued to tell them about everything we had read. How one of the analysts, Edvard, wandered outside his cabin under the belief that there was someone else stranded in a snowstorm. How he happened upon the entity and was saved by his fellow employee, Emma. They proceeded to have a conversation that the commander suspected was the entity trying to ascertain the nature of humanity. The motivation behind this was still vague, but the commander believed the entity was attempting to assimilate. That it either was hoping to mimic our behaviors, or at the very least, gather an understanding of our species.

He noted that Its approach focused more on emotions and thought patterns as opposed to defense mechanisms and warfare procedures. It showed little to no interest in our technological advancements. Which, in the commander‚Äôs mind, meant the entity was either extremely naive in nature or completely unconcerned with humanity‚Äôs abilities to repel Its presence.

Then, he told them how Edvard, infected by the entity, went back to the outskirts to dig the creature up. That he tried to free It from the ice but was stopped by Emma. This resulted in the deaths of the American skeleton crew aside from Emma, who took her own life after believing she too had fallen victim to the entity‚Äôs influence. A last ditch effort to contain It.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know where It came from,‚Äù the commander said, ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know why It‚Äôs here, and we don‚Äôt know what It planned to do if It successfully broke out of the ice. What we do know is that It‚Äôs dangerous, has parasitic tendencies, and will stop at nothing to gain Its freedom. While It behaves in a relatively peaceful manner at first, if It at all feels provoked or in danger, It becomes hostile in ways you cannot begin to imagine.‚Äù

Benny scoffed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre fucking serious, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù

‚ÄúAfraid so,‚Äù the commander replied. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt tell you because‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause you think one of us might have been infected,‚Äù Ludwig finished.

Begrudgingly, he nodded. ‚ÄúMaybe more than one.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you tell the American company about this?‚Äù Javier asked. ‚ÄúI mean, shouldn‚Äôt they know? It‚Äôs technically their problem, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was Their problem, yes,‚Äù the commander agreed. ‚ÄúBut now, this issue has fallen into our laps.‚Äù He lowered his revolver, holstering it. ‚ÄúI had Sonya radio Command, requesting we be given more time to investigate the American camp. Chances are slim that They‚Äôll grant us any extra time. So, tomorrow morning, we‚Äôll ride back out there and try to destroy the entity before the Americans can send a rescue team.‚Äù

‚ÄúDestroy It?‚Äù Benny asked. ‚ÄúHow the hell are we supposed to do that?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the demolition expert.‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean, I could rig up a couple of homemade fire bombs or something, but we‚Äôd need to put in a request for dynamite or thermal charges. Not that Command would just give us any.‚Äù

Ludwig exhaled laboriously, his hands smothering his face in frustration. ‚ÄúYou should have told us. I collected tissue samples from the infected employee. Am I infected now?‚Äù

The commander was calm when he said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a distinct possibility. Any of us could be infected. Maybe all of us.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, how do we know? What are the symptoms?‚Äù

‚ÄúConfusion, memory loss, disorientation, perhaps fatigue. When Edvard was infected, he showed an ignorance to weather and temperature as well as an enhanced immune system. There was also a sense of detachment from his emotions and memories. Emma experienced a similar phenomenon near the end. There was an emphasis on her failing cognition. That she was losing track of time, and she could feel the entity manipulating her thoughts.‚Äù

Benny lifted his head and looked around. ‚ÄúDoes anyone feel that now?‚Äù

The commander laughed. ‚ÄúI appreciate the effort, Ben, but the entity exhibits cautious behavior about outing itself. Whether Edvard knew he was infected or not is ambiguous, and if he did know, he made no mention of it to Emma.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are forgetting something, Commander,‚Äù Ludwig said. ‚ÄúThose aren‚Äôt exactly uncommon symptoms. Cold temperatures, lack of daylight, isolation from humanity. It is only natural that we might develop mental fatigue or depression or lack of concentration in our given environment.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt speak. I didn‚Äôt know what to do, or if there even was anything I could do to help. The situation felt helpless. We were just waiting to see what would happen. Hoping for the best, but ultimately, preparing for the worst. And as this sense of dread unfolded between us, we all looked around at one another, realizing just how dire our situation actually was.

‚ÄúWhat about the biological process?‚Äù Ludwig asked optimistically. ‚ÄúWhen the host is infected, is the entity taking control of the mind, or is it inserting its own cells‚Äî‚Äù

The commander held up a hand to silence him. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know. When the others confronted Edvard, his body began to transform. But it‚Äôs not clear whether those were his own cells or the entity‚Äôs. Maybe it was a mixture of both. By the time the American‚Äôs employees discovered the entity, it was too late. They didn‚Äôt have a chance to perform tests or draw any conclusions. They were already dead.‚Äù

‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt we do something?‚Äù Javier asked. ‚ÄúI mean, that thing is out there.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt go out in a storm like this,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúRight now, as far as we know, It‚Äôs still buried beneath a thick layer of ice and snow. The storm will be gone by tomorrow morning. That‚Äôll be the first chance we have to take action.‚Äù

‚ÄúFuck the storm! I say we go out there now and kill it. Actually, screw that. Why don‚Äôt we just radio the American company and tell them to deal with it. Call Command and get us a ride out of here.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat is not a bad idea,‚Äù Ludwig commented. ‚ÄúIf it was the American‚Äôs employees that first discovered this entity, then it should be their responsibility to handle It. No?‚Äù

I glanced at the commander, recognizing the exhaustion on his face. The slight hum of intoxication in his eyes. He seemed more inclined to fall asleep than to answer any more questions.

‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt plan on telling the American company,‚Äù I admitted. ‚ÄúAnd for the time being, we weren‚Äôt going to tell Command either. It‚Äôs too dangerous for anyone else to get involved. We need to contain the entity‚Äôs reach. Try to keep the situation isolated from the rest of society.‚Äù

Ludwig threw up his hands. ‚ÄúThis is bullshit!‚Äù

‚ÄúQuite,‚Äù the commander replied. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm open to suggestions.‚Äù

At that, the room was silent again. We looked around at each other, uncertain and afraid. We were expecting to encounter difficulties out here, but this wasn‚Äôt something anyone could prepare us for.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs late,‚Äù the commander finally said. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt we call it a night? Return to our quarters, try to get some sleep, and finish this in the morning.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow the hell are we supposed to sleep after this?‚Äù Javier asked.

‚ÄúWith your doors locked,‚Äù I suggested.

The commander nodded agreeingly. Then, he went to the end of the hall and removed the armory key from the hook on the wall. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll keep this with me. If anyone has a problem with that, let me know.‚Äù His hand came down to rest on the grip of his revolver. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure we can figure somethin‚Äô out.‚Äù

‚ÄúOnce this is done with,‚Äù Ludwig said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm outta here. I‚Äôll make sure Command hears about this.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just fine by me, but nobody leaves until we‚Äôre finished here.‚Äù

After that, we retired to our rooms. No one bothered cleaning up the lounge, it seemed pointless to do so. Not to mention we had all become conscious of each other, the gaps between us steadily growing.

Ahead of me, I watched Javier and Ludwig whispering amongst themselves. I tried to hear what they were saying, but I couldn‚Äôt make out their voices over the sound of shuffling feet and creaking floorboards. So, instead, I looked over at Benny to see if he had anything to say, but he ignored me. Arianna was quiet too. She retrieved her Bible from the coffee table and stared at her feet as she walked past me.

‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù I asked her.

She shrugged. ‚ÄúAre any of us?‚Äù

Then, she slipped inside her room and closed the door behind her. The others did the same. I watched as their doors slammed shut, listened as the locks clicked into place. I turned around and looked across the room at the commander. He just waved before heading into his office.",1,1742287197.0,scaryjujuarmy,0,1.0,False

It's a sad moment (that feels pretty familiar after I smashed the glass cone on my switch last year) but it's time for a replacement. I actually really liked my 02, but I'd like to branch out and see what I've been missing.

What do you guys recommend? I've seen a lot of recommendations for kinto on similar posts here. I'm pretty tempted to get the sepia 2 cup server. But I have a couple thoughts:

1. Given my track record, should I be looking at Tritan servers instead of glass? Anybody in Europe got one? I've read good things about the cafec tritan server, but I haven't found a source for one in Austria.
2. One of the things I liked a lot about the 02 was it's shape: I loved the look of the ridged cone design, and found it was really good at keeping coffee inside while swirling. The ridges also disrupt the swirl and get more air into the coffee. Do you need to swirl? I don't know, but I enjoy it, and want to believe that aeration is important somehow.

I was being a teenager, and it made me feel like I was the worst person in the whole world.

And the thing is, I'd been gone long enough, hanging out with like, you know, normal people, that when I went back, I actually found the doctrine kind of shocking. 
Like, yeah women can't hold the priesthood or any position of authority that doesn't involve children, but I didn't realize we were misogynists! And yeah i mean I knew we didn't want the gays to get married, but has the church really been homophobic this whole time?? 

So I did what I had done a lot of times when there was something I needed to ask God about. I prayed, and I opened my quad( that's the BOM, old testament, new testament, and The Doctrine and Covenants, sort of all bound together. Mine was blue, and had my deadname engraved in it.) So I prayed and asked God, 

Dear heavenly father, I'm coming to you because I'm confused. I feel in my heart, That men and women are equal. That we shouldn't be judging someone's moral character by whether or not they embrace the gender roles assigned to them. I know that in the past, you've withheld church doctrine and policies, because humanity wasn't ready for that sort of change. Is it truly your will that women be subjugated in this way? Is it truly your will that men be required to fill every position of authority?

Now I believe in a soul. I do believe that deities and other beings can speak to us. 
So when I tell you that truly, I recieved a spiritual embrace, I mean it. And this cosmic hug was made of pure mansplaining condescension. 
And I opened up my quad to a passage that said 

""Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church, his body, and is himself its Savior. Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit in everything to their husbands.""

And there I was, a devout member if the church of jesus christ of latter saints, confronted with the realization
That God was frat bro who listens to Joe Rogan podcasts. 
It wasn't that God wasn't real, or that the doctrine just wasn't what he wanted it to be, or even that the prophets had been blinded by their own biases. It was that the all-loving all knowing, all powerful, all benevolent being that I and my ancestors for 200 years had been worshipping believed that women shouldn't be given equal station to men, and I knew in my bones that he was WRONG. 

God was wrong. 

What was I supposed to do with that?
Oh your entire world view is completely predicated on the idea that this being is infallible, but when you bring up first wave feminism, he's like cool story babe now make me sandwich??
--- 
Anyway, so that's the gist of that experience. Anyone else get God to talk back and find the sound of his voice grating as hell? I'm curious to hear about it. ",1,1742286772.0,exmormonwitches,0,1.0,False

We shouldn't add accessories activities in the business activities. For this store with a coffee bar I had : browse and buy, drink coffee, be friendly and listen to music. Sims would barely buy anything. I removed all the activities and only left the buy option. 

They're still hanging out but it's more natural than them buying drinks like crazy and they're buying more products quicker. Also I don't have the same customers spending hours in the store. There's more turn over.

At first I also had pottery and painting activities, it was so much work scraping their stuff for very little money. For me it works better to have a 2d business customized  as an art center/museum with classes. I added City Living food stalls and Sims will eat if they're hungry without overdoing it. It's also cheaper to hire a vendor than pay an employee and they work better.
