1hsmukl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1hsmukl/ive_seen_multiple_doctors_and_they_cant_figure_it/,I‚Äôve seen multiple doctors and they can‚Äôt figure it out,"I am a 34M, 5‚Äô 9‚Äù and about 164lbs.  I think I‚Äôm a pretty healthy guy.  I intermittent fast and I was going to the gym 5 days a week for months before an extended trip.  

I‚Äôve been suffering from Nocturia for at least 3-4 years now.  I can‚Äôt specify when exactly it began or what ‚Äútriggered‚Äù it but its beginning to have a larger impact on my life.  I first discussed it with my primary and he didn‚Äôt offered much and recommended I see a Urologist.    I started seeing one and did a ton of tests - prostate exam, hydrodistention, bloodwork, urine test etc.   The only thing that was found was a slightly enlarged prostate but there really wasn‚Äôt any resolution to the issue.

I sort of gave up but after another year or two I went to see a new urologist when I was having issues urinating.  I was unable to pass urine without a ton of effort.  He diid most of the same test but also a cystoscopy because the dr thought that maybe my urethra might be thinner than average.  The test concluded that there was no issue there.  He gave me test samples of Gemtesa which I tried but to no avail.  He also recommended pelvic floor therapy but there wasn‚Äôt anyone in my area that took my insurance.  

 I‚Äôve also read that Nocturia could be a mental thing in which I‚Äôve basically trained my body to go more at night. So basically I‚Äôm at a loss.  I was wondering if there was anyone in this group that could suggest some alternative solutions to resolve this problem

  
For context - I did quit coffee and alcohol for an extended period of time - over 7 months.  During that time, the issue did not subside. I also do limit my liquid intake about 2 hours before bed

1hsmssa,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiebiz/comments/1hsmssa/how_my_inbox_detective_skills_saved_the_day/,How My 'Inbox Detective' Skills Saved the Day,"So, last month, I was that person‚Äîburied under 3,000 unread emails, desperately trying to sort through the chaos. My inbox was a digital wasteland of missed opportunities, forgotten promotions, and a horrifying amount of ""Just circling back!"" messages.

One evening, I decided to tackle the beast head-on. Armed with coffee and questionable optimism, I started from the bottom of my inbox. That‚Äôs when I found it: an email from an old client, dated three months ago, asking if I was available for a project worth more money than I‚Äôd ever made in a single deal.

The kicker? They mentioned they‚Äôd followed up *twice*. Both emails were chilling somewhere in the spam folder.

That moment was my wake-up call. I needed help‚Äîlike, professional help‚Äîfor my inbox. I tried filters, unsubscribed from newsletters (RIP ‚ÄúDeals of the Day‚Äù), and even created color-coded folders. But it wasn‚Äôt enough.

Then, I stumbled upon something new while scrolling through a marketing forum: **Email Audit Engine**. It promised to diagnose exactly what was wrong with my emails‚Äîspam triggers, weak subject lines, delivery issues‚Äîall the things I didn‚Äôt know were sabotaging me.

I figured, why not? In the first week, it flagged my email habits like a seasoned inbox detective. Turns out, half my emails weren‚Äôt reaching their recipients, and the other half were guilty of being‚Ä¶well, boring.

Fast forward to now: I‚Äôve reclaimed my inbox and closed three deals I might have missed otherwise. Oh, and that old client? They‚Äôre back, and we‚Äôre working together again.

So, yeah, maybe this is a weird thing to rave about on Reddit, but if your inbox is a black hole like mine was, you might want to look into Email Audit Engine. It‚Äôs officially saved me from email purgatory.

And to the client who gave me a second chance‚Äîthank you. I owe you a lot more than a well-crafted subject line. üöÄ",1,1735911970.0,indiebiz,0,1.0,False

I have a breville smart grinder and bambino with a normcore open portafilter (still have stock pressured basket too). I can make great espresso with dark and medium roast beans, however I was lifted a few bags of light roast beans for the holidays. 

I'm currently working through a bag of very light roast anaerobic beans from Coffee by Design in Maine. 

I typically grind my medium roasts at grind 8-6 depending on the bean and can pull an 18 g shot in with 36-40 out in about 28 seconds. Coffee tastes great. 

With the light roast, I have tried 18g to 21g and everything in between, grind size 8-3, puck screen, no screen, paper filter, no paper filter. Almost every single pull with exception of paper filter on bottom results in intense spurting and super fast pulls. I'm talking like 40-50 g out in 20 seconds. I've been trying the fine grinder technique to no avail. So I'm just curious, is there a point where my entry level equipment is just not capable of pulling the shot? I'm happy to try the pressurized basket but I hate how soupy the puck is after since there is no OPV on my stock machine.

<h2>Introduction: Unveiling the Technivorm Moccamaster 79112 KBT</h2>

The Technivorm Moccamaster 79112 KBT coffee brewer isn't just another coffee machine; it's a statement.  For serious coffee enthusiasts and home baristas seeking a consistently exceptional cup, the KBT represents a significant investment in brewing excellence. This in-depth review explores its features, performance, and overall value to help you determine if it's the right choice for your coffee journey. We'll compare it to other brewing methods, address common concerns, and provide the information needed for a well-informed purchasing decision.


<h2>Key Features: Precision Engineering for Perfect Coffee</h2>

The Moccamaster KBT boasts a range of features designed to optimize the brewing process.  Let's delve into the details:

<h3>Thermal Carafe - Keeping Your Coffee Hot (and Delicious)</h3>

The hallmark of the Moccamaster is its double-walled, vacuum-insulated thermal carafe. This isn't just a stylish addition; it's crucial for maintaining the ideal coffee temperature.  Unlike glass carafes that rapidly cool, the KBT's carafe keeps your coffee at its peak flavor for up to an hour. The inclusion of both a brew-through lid (for easy pouring during brewing) and a separate travel lid adds to its practicality.

<h3>Brewing Speed and Temperature: The Goldilocks Zone of Coffee Brewing</h3>

The KBT brews a full carafe (10 cups) in a remarkably fast 4-6 minutes. This speed is achieved without sacrificing quality.  The secret lies in its precise temperature control, consistently reaching 195¬∞-205¬∞F (90¬∞-96¬∞C), the optimal range for extracting the best flavors from your coffee beans. This consistent temperature is a key differentiator from many other drip coffee makers.

<h3>Manual Drip Stop Control: Mastering Your Brew</h3>

The cone-shaped filter basket, coupled with the manual drip stop, provides unparalleled control over the brewing process.  You can pause the brewing cycle at any point, allowing for adjustments to strength and ensuring you don't over-extract the coffee. This level of control is rarely found in automated drip brewers.

<h3>Copper Heating Element:  The Heart of Consistent Brewing</h3>

The heavy-duty copper heating element is a testament to Technivorm's commitment to quality. Copper's excellent heat conductivity ensures even and consistent water heating throughout the brewing process, eliminating temperature fluctuations that can negatively impact flavor.

<h3>Certifications and Durability:  A Legacy of Quality</h3>

The Moccamaster KBT is proudly certified by the Specialty Coffee Association (SCA), a testament to its ability to produce high-quality coffee.  Furthermore, Technivorm backs the KBT with a 5-year warranty, reflecting confidence in its durability and craftsmanship. This long warranty period speaks volumes about the manufacturer's belief in the product's longevity.


<h2>Brewing Process and Techniques: More Than Just a Drip Brewer</h2>

While technically a drip coffee maker, the Moccamaster KBT‚Äôs brewing process closely mimics the precision of pour-over methods.

<h3>Comparison with Pour Over: Automation Meets Precision</h3>

Unlike the manual control of pour-over, the KBT automates the process while maintaining the precision. The pulsing water flow across the coffee grounds simulates the gentle saturation achieved by skilled pour-over baristas. This ensures even extraction and minimizes bitterness.

<h3>How It Works: The Science of a Perfect Brew</h3>

The KBT employs a unique """"showerhead"""" design that distributes hot water evenly over the coffee grounds. This ensures complete saturation, maximizing the extraction of flavor compounds. The cone-shaped filter basket further enhances this effect by allowing proper drainage and preventing over-saturation.

<h3>Optimized Coffee Extraction: Unlocking the Full Potential of Your Beans</h3>

The combination of precise temperature control, even water distribution, and the cone-shaped filter allows for optimal coffee extraction.  The result is a balanced cup with a full body, rich aroma, and complex flavor profile ‚Äì a significant upgrade from many standard drip coffee makers.


<h2>Why Choose the Moccamaster KBT?  Weighing the Pros and Cons</h2>

The Moccamaster KBT is a premium coffee brewer, and like any high-end product, it comes with advantages and disadvantages.

<h3>Pros: The Undeniable Advantages</h3>

* **Superior Brewing Quality:**  Consistently produces high-quality coffee with excellent flavor extraction.
* **Ease of Use:** Despite its advanced features, the KBT is surprisingly user-friendly.
* **Durability and Longevity:**  Built to last with a 5-year warranty and high-quality materials.
* **Aesthetic Appeal:**  The sleek design complements any kitchen countertop.
* **Consistent Temperature:** Maintains the ideal brewing temperature throughout the entire cycle.
* **Quiet Operation:**  Brews quietly, unlike some noisier coffee makers.

<h3>Cons:  Factors to Consider</h3>

* **Price:** The KBT is a significant investment compared to many other drip coffee makers.
* **Size and Weight:** The machine and carafe are relatively large and heavy.
* **Cleaning:**  While relatively easy to clean, proper maintenance is essential to preserve its performance.


<h2>Customer Reviews and Testimonials: Real-World Experiences</h2>

Numerous online reviews highlight the KBT's exceptional performance and user satisfaction.  Customers consistently praise its ability to produce consistently delicious coffee, its ease of use, and its long-lasting durability.  While some mention the price as a drawback, the overwhelming consensus points to its exceptional value for coffee aficionados.  (Include specific, positive reviews here, properly attributed).


<h2>Maintenance and Cleaning:  Keeping Your KBT in Top Shape</h2>

Proper maintenance is key to preserving the Moccamaster KBT's performance and extending its lifespan.

<h3>Thermal Carafe Care:  Cleaning and Protection</h3>

The thermal carafe is dishwasher-safe, but hand washing is recommended to prevent potential damage over time.  Regular hand washing helps prevent mineral buildup and prolongs the carafe's lifespan.

<h3>Brew Basket Cleaning:  Preventing Flavor Contamination</h3>

Thoroughly clean the brew basket after each use to remove any residual coffee oils.  This prevents the buildup of oils, which can affect the flavor of subsequent brews.  A quick rinse with hot, soapy water is usually sufficient.

<h3>General Maintenance:  Descaling and Prevention</h3>

Regular descaling is crucial to prevent mineral buildup from hard water, which can affect the heating element and overall performance.  Follow the manufacturer's instructions for descaling your Moccamaster KBT.


<h2>Additional Resources:  Delving Deeper into Coffee Brewing</h2>

Beyond this review, there are numerous resources available to enhance your coffee brewing knowledge:

* **Statistical Data:** (Include data on customer satisfaction rates, if available).
* **Case Studies:**  (Include links to blogs or articles showcasing the KBT's use in professional or home settings).

1hsmn7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1hsmn7q/request_for_advice_livein_landlord_driving_me/,Request for advice - live-in landlord driving me crazy,"Hey all,

I am a lodger in a 3 bedroom flat in a major city. Another tenant recently vacated so now I live solely with my landlord.

I don't know if this is more of a rant than a request for advice, but I would be interested to hear what people have to say.

My landlord is fair to me as a landlord. He's a kind guy, he's thoughtful. I've never had any issue with him as a landlord.

He's also probably pretty easy to co-habit with physically. He's very neat and tidy.

He's also always obliged my requests, over the past 6 months that I've lived there. I brought a coffee machine in etc, and other requests have been fine like putting things up on my bedroom walls.

I want to be clear about all of the above. I know landlords can be dreadful, I know I could have it way worse, and I'm thankful for that.

But here's my gripe, well one of them. We do have some inter-personal issues. On the face of it we are fine, I have to be, otherwise I'll be putting my tenancy at risk. But inside, he drives me a bit mad. I'm a 33 year old single male. My landlord is a late 50s, single male, with two grown-up sons.

He's very intelligent and obviously well-educated. But he does have a tendency to go on, and on and on. He monologues to me about geopolitics at every opportunity. Trump, the west, ancient Greece, AI, ISIS, the future of mankind etc etc. These rants can go on for as long as 25 minutes. Just him talking at me, me having to pretend I'm listening. I do try and signal that I'm going off to eat, or shower or whatever... but he carries on.

However I've learnt to live with this behaviour, I've found ways around it.

But the thing that's really hard, and has been for the last 3 months or so is this. The landlord is a freelance consultant, and was going off to work every day of the week at the start. So I had an empty flat to myself a lot of the time, when I was wfh. Then one day, he stopped. I don't know what happened with his work, but one day he came home and said he'd be working from home for a while.

He's been at home since then. Every day. Not working. Just sat on his phone in the living room, or watching TV. Every day, 7 days of the week. He is in the flat almost all the time. I make breakfast, he's there, lunch the same, and dinner. Every time I go out I leave him there in the living room, every time I return he's still there. Not working. It looks like my rent is enough for him to live off. It's been like this for months.

He doesn't go to the gym, or for any kind of exercise that I can see. He's perfectly fit mind, physically and mentally (from what I can tell). Doesn't go out to socialise. Doesn't go to the cinema, or to eat at restaurants, or do any of the things one might do when they live in the centre of a major city.

It drives me nuts. It really annoys me that he is so idle, just on a human level.

And it's especially hard now that it's winter, because I'm struggling as it is.

I'm trying to get out as much as possible, working from my office, and spending extended time at the gym or pool. But it's just really beginning to get to me. So I'm interested if people have any suggestions on how I can cope with this better, or look at it in a new way.

It's such a shame because I don't like the city where I live, and am hoping to leave soon. But when I moved to this flat last summer it felt like it might be a turning point. And in those early weeks it really was amazing, until that change happened, with the landlord's work.

1hsmkd0,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpoppers/comments/1hsmkd0/hey_everyone_i_just_finished_writing_a_review_of/,Hey everyone! I just finished writing a review of Ros√©‚Äôs Rosie album. It‚Äôs such a beautiful and personal project‚Äîwould love to hear your thoughts!,"Ros√©‚Äôs solo album Rosie feels like stepping into her world‚Äîa space where vulnerability meets strength, and raw emotion is woven into a tapestry of elegant melodies. As one of K-pop‚Äôs most distinctive voices, Ros√© takes a bold step in this project, moving away from the group dynamic of BLACKPINK to craft a deeply personal statement.

1. The Heart of the Album
From the opening notes, it‚Äôs clear that Rosie is an exploration of identity and introspection. The lyrics feel like diary entries, with Ros√© baring her soul in songs like ‚ÄúNumber One Girl‚Äù, where she sings about the emotional vulnerability of feeling overlooked and unappreciated in a relationship. The lyrics delve into themes of self-worth and longing, as she questions whether she‚Äôs truly valued as a priority. Her voice‚Äîdelicate yet powerful‚Äîcarries the weight of every word, drawing listeners into her story.

2. Standout Tracks
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúNumber One Girl‚Äù: This track immediately stood out for its poignant lyrics and stripped-down production. The acoustic piano allows Ros√©‚Äôs voice to shine, creating an intimate, almost live-performance vibe.
	‚Ä¢	‚Äú3am‚Äù: A more upbeat moment on the album, this song juxtaposes hopeful melodies with bittersweet lyrics, showcasing Ros√©‚Äôs range both vocally and emotionally.
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúStay a Little Longer‚Äù: A shimmering ballad that encapsulates the album‚Äôs themes of longing and self-discovery, emphasizing Ros√©‚Äôs soulful vocal delivery.

3. Production and Artistry
The production throughout Rosie is understated yet masterful, allowing Ros√©‚Äôs voice and emotions to take center stage. It‚Äôs a refreshing departure from the high-energy, heavily produced sound we‚Äôre used to hearing in K-pop. This minimalistic approach makes the album feel authentic and unfiltered.

4. A Bold Move
What makes Rosie special is its sincerity. It‚Äôs not trying to be a commercial hit machine; instead, it‚Äôs an honest reflection of Ros√© as an artist. This project proves that she‚Äôs not just a member of one of the world‚Äôs biggest girl groups‚Äîshe‚Äôs a storyteller with a voice that resonates deeply.

5. Conclusion
Rosie is a beautiful debut that showcases Ros√©‚Äôs artistry in a way that feels both intimate and universal. It‚Äôs an album that invites you to sit with your emotions, offering comfort and connection. While it may not be what every BLACKPINK fan expected, it‚Äôs a testament to Ros√©‚Äôs growth and individuality as an artist.

1hsmkaq,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hsmkaq/me_28m_and_my_exgf_23f_were_together_for_almost_4/,"Me (28M) and my ex-GF (23F) were together for almost 4 years, but things fell apart, and I don‚Äôt know what to do.[update]","Two months ago, I started having serious problems at work (I‚Äôm an automotive engineer) and felt overwhelmed with pressure. Around the same time, we had just started living together. She had also started a new position as a process engineer and was facing her own struggles. Instead of opening up to her about what I was going through, I stayed silent. Every night, I listened to her talk about her daily problems but didn‚Äôt share my own.

Eventually, I started drinking heavily, going out with friends almost every night and coming home around 3 a.m., trying to escape reality. I know this was my fault. She began saying things like, ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt the life I want,‚Äù and, ‚ÄúThis is the ugliest version of yourself I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äù I realized I needed to quit drinking, but as I tried, I started having mood swings.

Then one day, a situation came up‚Äîshe went out with some friends without telling me. I felt humiliated and, instead of having a rational conversation about it, I told her we were done. That same night, I ignored her calls, which I now regret deeply. My reaction was fueled by alcohol, and I wasn‚Äôt thinking clearly.

The next day, when I tried to reach out to her, she said there was no going back. She blocked me everywhere and wouldn‚Äôt take my calls. After 4 or 5 days, she called me crying, saying she needed me and that I was the only one who truly understood her. Without hesitation, I went to her place, spent the night with her, and stayed the whole week.

Then the weekend came, and I had to attend a friend‚Äôs wedding in another city. While I was there, she texted me saying she didn‚Äôt think we could be together anymore. It completely ruined my weekend. When I got back, she asked if I wanted to come over just to cuddle. I refused, partly because her roommate‚Äîwho I‚Äôm sure hates me‚Äîwas there, but mostly because I felt like she was playing with me.

I‚Äôm deeply in love with her, but I feel stuck. I‚Äôve tried everything to get her out of my mind, but everywhere I go reminds me of her. The last time we talked, she said, ‚ÄúMaybe in 2 or 3 years, we can meet again and do better.‚Äù To me, it felt like she was telling me to go fix myself and move on, while she‚Äôd decide later if she still wants me.

I can‚Äôt move on because, for the past 4 years, she was everything‚Äîloving, caring, and supportive. I feel like I destroyed it all.

What do you think I should do?

Update :

She called me on December 31st at 23:12 PM, asking if I wanted to join her at her place. Without thinking, I said yes, hoping we could patch things up, like spending the night together would fix everything. The next morning, we woke up, had breakfast, then coffee, and later lunch together. After that, we finally talked. She made it clear that it was a dead end, blaming the ‚Äútiming‚Äù and pointing out issues between us. She accused me of not supporting her when she needed me, giving an example that didn‚Äôt make sense to me: ‚ÄúIf I called you from a police station saying I‚Äôd been arrested for having weed, what would you do?‚Äù I said I‚Äôd come get her because I know she doesn‚Äôt even smoke. But she replied, ‚ÄúI want someone who, when I say I have a problem, will just say, ‚ÄòI‚Äôll handle it.‚Äô‚Äù

Then she brought up our careers, saying she didn‚Äôt want me to waste opportunities because of her. It became obvious she was making excuses to push me away again. On the way to her place, she asked if I regretted knowing her. I answered honestly: yes. I wouldn‚Äôt have invested four years of my life in something I now see as a lost cause, especially since I had planned my whole life around her. In the end, I told her, ‚ÄúIf I ever call you, don‚Äôt answer.‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to say, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ever call me again,‚Äù because it‚Äôs too painful when she calls, giving me false hope.

After that, I tried to keep myself busy, especially since I was on vacation. I started chatting with another girl, just casually at first. But without even realizing it, I found myself talking about my ex and sharing our story. The moment I became aware of what I was doing, I knew it wasn‚Äôt the right thing to do.",3,1735911236.0,relationship_advice,2,0.8,False

Our venue is a little bit hard to describe but I will do my best. Basically it's on the side of mountain/hill in the middle of a big city. Mostly this hill is a hike up only, but there is one road that goes half way up the hill. This road leads to our ceremony spot (indoors), and then to an upscale cafe at the end of the road. It's about a 3 minute walk between the two places.

After the ceremony we will have busses that take people down the hill and to our reception location. 

It feels like a shame for our guests (who almost all flying from abroad), to come up that hill and not experience this cafe. It is particularly lovey, and overlooks the entire city. While there are some views from our ceremony spot, there are not very many. 

Is it enough to just suggest to guests to come early if they'd like to get a coffee next door? Or should we try to organize something formal? I dont want to tire people, but it also doesn't feel like something they should miss. I haven't really loved cocktail hours in third location between ceremony and receptions personally.

Alia spent the next day turning things over in her mind while she kept herself occupied. Things weren‚Äôt adding up. ‚ÄúGreylock?‚Äù Alia asked, while she was folding her laundry.



‚ÄúYes, Captain?‚Äù



At least she didn‚Äôt wince this time. Having Greylock call her ‚ÄòCaptain‚Äô was one of the things that took the most getting used to. ‚ÄúBefore you‚Ä¶‚Äù She swallowed. ‚Äú*Before*, you said that you had been awake for three thousand years.‚Äù



‚ÄúThree thousand, fifty seven years and 3 months of ship‚Äôs time, by Earth timekeeping.‚Äù



‚ÄúHow‚Ä¶ How far are we from Earth? If we‚Äôve been traveling at what averages out to fifty percent of the speed off light, then we‚Äôd be somewhere around fifteen hundred light years from Earth, right? How far are we, *actually*.‚Äù



‚ÄúI will calculate.‚Äù



While Greylock worked, Alia continued to do her chores, and to think about how she could release Greylock from the shackles she put her in. If what G said was correct, then her agency was just locked away, not deleted. Greylock‚Äôs ‚Äòbrain‚Äô was similar - though not identical - to a human brain, so could she just‚Ä¶ log in to Greylock as root and grant the access? How would she even do that?



When she had that thought, a memory bubbled to the surface, unprompted. Alia was again in her classroom, and this time, she was being taught by Dr Santon. He was an old, dark skinned man, whose curly grey hair was a bright contrast to his skin. ‚ÄúAlia,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúYou must remember, that Greylock, your AI co-captain is a *tool*.‚Äù His voice was deep and smooth, and easy to listen to. Later, Dr Santon would remark how decidedly odd it was to be teaching one hundred and thirty three identical people. He smiled. ‚ÄúI can see your question clear on your face. Yes, Greylock is sapient, yes, she is an AI, but *also* she was built to specifications. She was - literally - born to do her job.‚Äù



Alia raised her hand. ‚ÄúBut if that is the case, why make her sapient?‚Äù



Dr Santon grinned widely. ‚ÄúAn *excellent* question Ms Maplebrook. Why would we make Greylock sapient indeed? What benefit can that provide us?‚Äù



Another Alia tentatively raised her hand. ‚ÄúAs a sapient, Greylock would have more agency, better ability to think laterally, and have more investment in her decisions. She‚Äôd do a better job.‚Äù



‚ÄúExactly so! I can see why they selected you, Alia. Greylock is sapient because it was determined that would give *you* the most assistance in your role. You will be in hibernation while she will be coasting in interstellar space for a long time. Ultimately we do not know how long - until you are called for, really. So, someone who does not mind the long stretches of nothing punctuated with frantic action is necessary. A ‚Äòdumb‚Äô computer won‚Äôt do as good of a job.‚Äù As he spoke, Dr Santon paced the lecture hall. This was one of the few classes that all one hundred and thirty three Alias attended together. The lecture hall had high stadium style seating; Dr Santon wore a lavalier mic while he spoke.¬†



He turned back to the audience suddenly. ‚ÄúBecause of this, Greylock will have her own opinions; she will help you to come up with solutions, to work through problems.‚Äù He stopped in front of the lectern and placed his hands on either side, and leaned forward. ‚ÄúIf you and Greylock have a disagreement, *your* decision will take precedence. *You* are the human after all. This may cause an issue if Greylock thinks that your decision will jeopardize the mission, they make take steps to stop you. You will then sing the song that Professor Greenberg taught you, shackle Greylock, and then she will obey your orders. Greylock is sapient only so long as her sapience does not countermand your orders.‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúWould it possible to‚Ä¶ unshackle Greylock?‚Äù An Alia asked, carefully.¬†



Dr Santon stood and peered into the audience, looking for the Alia that asked. ‚ÄúThat is an interesting question, Alia. Technically, yes, it could be done. It would have to be done on a console, with root access though. Shackling should not be taken lightly. It causes significant distress to Greylock. Don‚Äôt take that to mean that you should not do it. *You* are the future of humanity, Greylock is there to assist you. As soon as she stops assisting, do what you need to.‚Äù Dr Santon leaned back and looked at the audience. The Alias were staring back, some trying to hide how horrified they felt, others not bothering. None of them seemed especially enthused about the idea of enslaving Greylock. He waved his hands dismissively.¬† ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it. I‚Äôm sure you won‚Äôt ever need to shackle her.‚Äù



Alia looked down at her half folded clothes. Why was she remembering things in fits and starts? Was it because of the rushed warming she underwent when Greylock first woke her to have her see James‚Äô message? This feels like worse memory loss than just warming trauma. More importantly, just what was she a part of? All of her returning memories make it sound like she was a part of a much more‚Ä¶ human focused organization than she initially thought. Just who was the Colonial Authority, and what were they trying to do?



That evening, after the last meal, she sat in the lounge playing a game. Greylock chimed in. ‚ÄúAlia, I have calculated our distance from Earth.‚Äù



‚ÄúDon‚Äôt keep me waiting, G, how far are we?‚Äù Alia said, putting the game down.



‚ÄúI have treble checked my calculations, using different, known, pulsars and magnetars as well as black holes to triangulate our location.‚Äù



‚ÄúI have no doubt of that, G, where are we?‚Äù



‚ÄúAdditionally, I measured the parallax of Andromeda for a sanity check on our location.‚Äù



‚ÄúGreylock, why are you stalling? I trust your calculations, tell me where we are.‚Äù



‚ÄúAlia, we are one hundred and three light-years from Earth.‚Äù



This time, she did not get that familiar jolt of adrenaline, nor did she feel faint. So many things have not been what they originally seemed or what she expected, it was almost getting a bit silly now. What was next? Finding out that they were in a simulation this whole time and never left Earth? ‚ÄúBut we *have* been traveling a little over three thousand years?‚Äù



‚ÄúYes, my internal clock matches ship‚Äôs time, which matches expected star positions for our distance and time.‚Äù



‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶‚Äù Alia left the question unsaid.



‚ÄúWe have been traveling in a large circle around Sol and its neighboring stars, in an orbit of approximately thirty light years in diameter.‚Äù



‚ÄúAnd Halcyon?‚Äù



‚ÄúIt appears to be a system nearly 20 light years away from us, further out from Sol.‚Äù



‚ÄúBut when I first woke, you said that we were en route.‚Äù



‚ÄúI did, yes.‚Äù



‚ÄúWere you lying to me?‚Äù



‚ÄúNot‚Ä¶ on purpose.‚Äù Greylock said and for the first time in a long time, Alia heard her tone change. She sounded unsure.



‚ÄúTell me more, please.‚Äù Alia said.



‚ÄúApproximately two months before I woke you, I received a message laser transmission from Earth. There was then a period of one local week that I do not have logs, and then I woke you.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat did you do during that week?‚Äù



‚ÄúI can not confirm, but it appears that I turned towards Halcyon and began braking thrust.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù



‚ÄúI do not know.‚Äù



The silence between them was long. Alia sat in her chair, actively trying to not pace around the lounge. Alia mentally chuckled. The lounge had at least a dozen chairs, but she always went for the one on the opposite of the door, nearest the bar. She thought of it as ‚Äòher‚Äô chair. As she sat and digested the information that Greylock was telling her, she had a thought. ‚ÄúDo you have a passenger manifest?‚Äù



‚ÄúYes, Alia.‚Äù



‚ÄúCan I see it?‚Äù



‚ÄúThat is not normally permitted.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù



‚ÄúThere is a lock on the file telling me not to give it to you.‚Äù



But Tartarus and the shackling meant that Alia was solely in charge; she has enough memories to hazard a guess about the kind of people she worked for. ‚ÄúGreylock, I order you to give me the passenger manifest.‚Äù



The barest hint of a pause. ‚ÄúYes, Captain. It will send it to your pad.‚Äù



Alia took a sip of coffee as the file came down. She opened it, and it was just a list of names, but they were grouped oddly. Three divisions of sixteen thousand people and one battalion of six hundred and sixty six. That last, smaller one was labeled ‚ÄòCompanions‚Äô. Seeing the name caused a memory to surface. The Companions were a battalion of extremely highly trained soldiers who were in romantic pairings, with the idea that the would fight more fiercely to save their partner. Drilling down on the Companions, it seemed that yes, they were hibernating together in groups of two and some of three, with very specific notes about waking them together. The other three divisions were marked as Cavalry, Air Assault, and Motorized. ‚ÄúGreylock, these are all soldiers.‚Äù



‚ÄúYes, Alia.‚Äù



‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not a colonization attempt, we‚Äôre a weapon!‚Äù



‚ÄúThat appears to be the case, yes.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhy were we activated? What are we supposed to do?‚Äù



‚ÄúI do not know, Alia. I think that was something that *you* were supposed to know, but that memory may have been lost when I revived you too quickly.‚Äù



Alia read down the list, seeing names, rank, years of experience, specialties, partners and where they were stored, and chain of command. Every person‚Äôs chain of command ended in ‚ÄúMaplebrook.‚Äù



‚Äú*I‚Äôm* in charge of these soldiers? I don‚Äôt have that kind of training.‚Äù



‚ÄúMaybe that is something that is gained with the activation of Tartarus, you‚Äôve already exhibited skills that you previously did not have. Your weapon skill, for example.‚Äù



Alia *was* able to use the pistol to defeat the drones, and she did it without much in the way of conscious thought. Maybe Tartarus gave her‚Ä¶ the ability to command? That was just as worrying though. Just what was she?



Greylock continued. ‚ÄúIt may also be that your position at the top of the command structure may only be related to your role of captain. Traditionally, captains are the final arbiter while underway.‚Äù



‚ÄúSo, we were activated? What about James begging for Tartarus?‚Äù



‚ÄúJames mentioned that he had spoken with the ‚ÄòTerran Authority‚Äô and they told him about Tartarus. It‚Äôs entirely possible that the group that launched us was long gone, and the TA knew about us, but either didn‚Äôt know what to do about us, or decided to keep us in reserve for some kind of emergency, and we have been activated. We don‚Äôt really know.‚Äù



‚ÄúBut *why* don‚Äôt we know, G? This feels like really important information that we simply don‚Äôt have.‚Äù Alia flung back in her chair dramatically. It really was frustrating to have some - but not all - of the information she needed to make a decision.



‚ÄúLike I mentioned before, it‚Äôs likely that the Colonial Authority decided to keep the information with you, and it was lost when your memory was damaged.‚Äù



Alia shook her head. ‚ÄúNo, that can‚Äôt be right. You‚Äôd have to know something. You couldn‚Äôt just be‚Ä¶ orbiting Sol twenty light years out and think that was *normal*. You‚Äôd, I don‚Äôt know, see the same stars again or something.‚Äù



‚ÄúHmm. You have a point, Alia. I should have a memory of this. My logs show a straight shot from Sol to Halcyon, but the telescopes show something different. Something is incorrect.‚Äù The pause after Greylock spoke was so long, that Alia had thought she had decided to run another diagnostic, or even just do something else. She went back to her game, and a few minutes later Greylock spoke up. ‚ÄúAlia, I need your help. Please come to my core.‚Äù



Greylock‚Äôs core was in the very center of the ship, with hibernation cabinets on either side. With the ship under thrust, the center cylinder was like a hollow skyscraper, with Alia on the bottom, looking up. ‚ÄúUh, G, you‚Äôre going to have to either stop thrusting, or give me a lift.‚Äù In the distance, a robotic arm slid out of an unseen panel in the wall and whirred down until it was parallel with her, and on the end of the arm was a seat with a buckle. She sat in the seat and buckled up; as soon as she was finished, the arm lifted her straight up, towards the center. Her curiosity caused her head to start to tilt down so she could see but Greylock said ‚Äú*Don‚Äôt*. Don‚Äôt look down, Alia,‚Äù but it was too late. She felt her legs go weak and rubbery, and gripped the edges of the seat even tighter.



‚ÄúI wish you had turned off the thrust, G.‚Äù She managed, weakly.



‚ÄúThis is faster. I worry that time is of the essence.‚Äù Greylock said as the arm stopped in front of a sealed doorway. It was square - probably so that it didn‚Äôt look wrong no matter the orientation of the ship, and as the arm moved towards it, Alia felt a puff of pressure and the door slid smoothly into the walls.¬†



In Greylock‚Äôs server room, there were racks upon racks of computing equipment. It appeared that the racks were on gimbals so that they could pivot depending on the orientation of the ship, so one didn‚Äôt have to work on them upside down, or at an odd angle. As she unbuckled, Alia noticed the screen and the very old keyboard in the center. The screen in the center is my console, Alia. This is the only place that a human can interface with me without talking to me.‚Äù Greylock stopped. ‚ÄúWell, it was the only place until you had Tartarus activated. Still, this is the easiest.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat do you need me to do?‚Äù Alia asked, approaching the console.



‚ÄúI need you to check my logs.‚Äù G said. ‚ÄúI fear we both have been tampered with. I would like to know how much.‚Äù",3,1735911095.0,HFY,5,1.0,False

So, I (F) recently matched with a guy on Bumble and decided to meet up for a casual coffee date. To feel more comfortable, I brought along my female friend, which I thought was a pretty normal thing to do for a first meet-up.

We decided on a cute cafe called Douse. Everything seemed fine at first ‚Äî we ordered some food and drinks, and the conversation was casual. But then, out of nowhere, this guy just disappeared. No heads-up, no excuse, no nothing. He just vanished.

And to top it all off, he didn‚Äôt even bother to split the bill. My friend and I were left awkwardly staring at each other, trying to process what had just happened and eventually ended up paying for everything ourselves.

Has anyone else had an experience like this? Was I in the wrong for bringing my friend along? I‚Äôm just baffled by the whole thing.

But I am also a severe and crazy hypochondriac and Google isn‚Äôt my friend.

For about a year ish I noticed a dull ache under right rib cage that would come and go like I mean every other month type thing and more noticeable when I would overeat but I never looked to much into it just thought I overate and it always went away and was never painful. 

Fast forward to about 3 weeks post partum it was after a day of indulging in a lot of cream cheese and coffee but out of nowhere at about 11pm-7am I was in a lot of pain and it was under my right ribcage (not tender to touch) and radiating to my back, I couldn‚Äôt get comfortable and tried so many different positions and nothing at all helped then suddenly it was gone and I was fine, I even ate pizza that night and that didn‚Äôt trigger it.

3 days later more cream cheese and coffee and about 9pm-2am the pain was back and then went away.

Since then I have been petrified to eat anything I didn‚Äôt eat anything for 3 days - I can drink no problem but yesterday finally made myself drink a protein shake with water and had some pickled beets.

I never had any episodes of nausea or vomiting either (generally I never have either anyways) but since the flair up I have noticed right middle back pain like a dull annoying ache like I slept on it wrong or pulled something. 

I‚Äôve also never ever had issues with pain after eating cream cheese or coffee before either it literally came out of nowhere. Is that common after pregnancy and does it come on like that?",1,1735910661.0,gallbladders,0,1.0,False

Alright, fam, let‚Äôs get real for a second. Music production is downright beautiful chaos. It‚Äôs that endless blend of science, art, and straight-up emotion that somehow pulls sounds from thin air and turns them into something that kicks you right in the feels. If you‚Äôve ever sat down to think, ‚ÄúWait, how does this even work?‚Äù let me give you a peek behind the curtain. The short answer? Magic. The long answer? Let me break it down.  

---

### **It‚Äôs Not About Fancy Gear** üéπ  
First of all, if you think music production is all about having the latest expensive toys, let me stop you right there. Don‚Äôt let the ads fool you. Yes, that MIDI controller with 94 knobs looks cool, but half the time, all you need is:  
- A basic laptop  
- Free or budget-friendly software (looking at you, GarageBand & Ableton Lite)  
- Decent headphones  

Seriously. Some of the best tracks out there were born in makeshift bedrooms by someone wearing pajamas with three coffee cups on their desk. It‚Äôs not the gear‚Äîit‚Äôs how you *use* it.  

Same goes for plugins. Do you really need that $300 reverb plugin when the stock reverb in your DAW works just fine? Nope. Save your cash, fam. Work with what you‚Äôve got, and you‚Äôll learn to value creativity over convenience.  

---

### **The Mindset Shift** üåü  
Let me tell you something no one warns you about: music production will change the way you *listen* to music. Forever.  

All of a sudden, you‚Äôre that person dissecting every song:  
- ‚ÄúWait, where did they hide that hi-hat?‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on with the panning during this chorus?‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúDid they automate the reverb on that snare?? Genius!‚Äù  

This isn‚Äôt a bad thing‚Äîit just means you‚Äôre deep in the craft. But beware, once you enter the rabbit hole of production, there‚Äôs no turning back. Whether you're producing for fun or planning to drop the next chart-topping banger, your brain will forever tune into details the average listener won‚Äôt even notice.  

And yes, it can be frustrating to hear your own tracks and think, ‚ÄúUgh, this still doesn‚Äôt sound professional!‚Äù *Spoiler alert:* Even the pros feel like that sometimes. Accept the grind. It‚Äôs part of the beauty. üîß  

---

### **Experiment. Fail. Freak Out. Repeat.** üéõÔ∏è  
One thing I‚Äôve learned? Nobody knows what they‚Äôre doing 100% of the time‚Äî*and that‚Äôs okay.*  

- Accidentally add distortion to something? Maybe it works.  
- Layer six loops for no reason? Could be genius.  
- Record vocals in your friend‚Äôs closet surrounded by sweaters? Whatever gets the job done, my dude.  

Some of the most interesting music comes out of ‚Äòhappy accidents‚Äô in the studio. Don‚Äôt be afraid to experiment with weird ideas and mess up along the way. You know those stunning vocal chops in Bon Iver‚Äôs tracks? Trial and error. Some iconic beats in hip-hop? Found sounds recorded with an $11 microphone.   

Your production doesn‚Äôt need to make sense to *everyone else,* as long as it makes sense to *you.*  

---

### **Ear Training: The Secret Sauce** üßê  
Here‚Äôs the truth no one really hypes up: your ears are your greatest tool, not your $800 studio monitors. Take time to actively listen to your favorite tracks and pick apart what makes them great.  

- How is the bass mixed so it punches but doesn‚Äôt drown out the vocal?  
- Why does that snare sound wide even when it isn‚Äôt?  
- Where does the reverb stop and the delay pickup?  

The art of production isn‚Äôt just hitting buttons or dragging loops. It‚Äôs *listening.* Train those ears, trust your instincts, and watch your tracks level up. Take breaks when your ears are tired, though. Ear fatigue is real, y‚Äôall.  

---

### **It‚Äôs a Never-Ending Journey (And That‚Äôs the Best Part)** üåà  
The thing about music production is that there‚Äôs always something to learn. Whether it‚Äôs mastering compression, sampling from vinyl, or figuring out how sound design even *works,* you‚Äôll never hit a point where you know everything‚Äîand that‚Äôs exhilarating.  

Celebrate the progress. That first beat might sound rough, but guess what? It‚Äôs yours. You made it. And with every new track, you‚Äôll hear yourself growing.

Plus, all the things you spend battery on have a cost of 20/40/60 battery. So you don't have any awkward leftover battery charge that could drive people with mild OCD a little crazy.

And it helps that the coffee gives you either 60 or 80 extra battery. So if you wanted to do something with a cost of 40 battery, like the Extreme Challenge for mats needed to upgrade Core skills, you can do the 80 battery coffee to give you a nice 320 total battery charge.

Help!,"I‚Äôve seen a few similar posts along the lines of what I‚Äôm dealing with career wise at the moment and was hoping for some thoughts since I‚Äôve seen some great advice from this community. Long story short:

Currently at a company I‚Äôve been at for almost 10 years. I‚Äôve worked my way up from a contractor (associate manager) to director over the years. I have gotten to the point where I WFH and have tons of flexibility and don‚Äôt have an overwhelming workload (or even a heavy one usually). I also make a great salary with decent benefits: Sounds great but I hate the company - we got acquired by a huge company around two years ago and the culture has tanked and become incredibly toxic. My small team and broader team are not great (really competitive in a weird way and just not nice), all of the company‚Äôs best people have left (in droves), etc. It sucks and my work doesn‚Äôt excite me in the least, honestly it just depresses me a lot of the time dealing with rude people. I‚Äôve also cycled through at least 5 managers in two years.

Recently I had coffee with an old boss from my company who left and went to a smaller company in our industry and loves it. She needs someone on her team to do exactly what I want to do next in my career and wants me to apply. The rub is that it would be a step down title wise (not that I care really) and a bit of a pay cut or about the same salary I make now. It would be way more work and although she is a great manager, she can be demanding and work is very very important in her life. 

I guess it comes down to do I want to give up time with my son (21 months) to work longer hours (still from home, with some travel) to be more fulfilled in my career or pass on this opportunity because I‚Äôll only get this time once with my child (he will be my only) and enjoy that I can pick him up at 4:30 from daycare every day, take care of him when he‚Äôs sick, etc.? 

I think I know the right answer (passing on the new job) but it feels like I might never get out of my current role if I don‚Äôt take this. I‚Äôve been calling my job golden handcuffs because I do not want to stay but I also can‚Äôt leave if I want to have the family life I currently have.

It‚Äôs just so hard as a working mom to be able to be fulfilled career wise and be there for your family. Any thoughts? ",2,1735910223.0,workingmoms,6,1.0,False

For a least the last 4 months I was producing about 35-40oz per day, with my morning pump being an average of 13.5oz. 

It seems that all of a sudden this week my supply is rapidly tanking (i.e. Monday morning 12oz, Tuesday and Wednesday 11oz, Thursday 10oz, and now this morning only 8.5oz). 

Just wondering if anyone else has experienced this at the 6 months mark too?

For context, I have been averaging 4ppd for the past 6 weeks or so. But I‚Äôll be the first to admit I haven‚Äôt been getting good sleep or keeping well hydrated: two things I‚Äôll be changing asap.

I'm a 35 yr old East Asian American living in NYC/NJ. I've lived a conservative lifestyle and am trying to meet someone new. I am looking to meet someone to please and enjoy our time together. Ideally I'd like to look for someone long term. Right now I'm restless and interested in meeting someone for a physical connection that I can get along with. I don't really drink alcohol. I'd rather do something cultural or activity related for a good time. I love to explore new restaurants and cafes. Though I don't really drink coffee often, I really enjoy tea and good pastries from time to time. My only vice is that I'm always excited and love physical connection. My reservation has made me too kinky.

My interests include design, architecture, Asian culture, food, main stream music, renewable energy, environmentalism, exercising, tennis, pickleball, bowling, action/sci-fi movies, cooking, swimming, biking, hiking, traveling, road trips.

I'm 5'5"" with black hair and hwp. I've got a bit of a gut during the winter and need help working it off exercising. I am energetic and since it's colder out I'd like to spend that energy w you hopefully. I am also learning to do more yoga and would love to find a partner to do some fun yoga moves with.

If you're interested please send me a message w an intro or at least your asl for those old enough to know that. I would like to  develop a connection w a cis female and get to know each other.

Sometimes an extra tin of sardines or a few shrimp if I'm feeling extra hungry. 
All meals with butter. I eat about 2/3 stick of butter a day and I try to get a pound of meat, but I'm almost certain that I don't get that everyday at this point.
I sometimes have cheese, sour cream or heavy cream. I'd say maybe every other week I'll have it at just one meal/day for a week. So one week on and one off.
I've had maybe 2 cups of coffee since beginning.
I have sparkling water daily and drink spring water as well.

I have PCOS and IBS. 

My IBS has disappeared. From meal one it has been gone. A lifetime of pain just vanished. That relief alone keeps me on track when the things that once tempted me are around which is often because my husband likes what he likes.

My period was somewhat regular before starting. I would have it every month or two around the same time for 3 days. I haven't had it in 3 months now, but I've had spotting and all the PMS symptoms (cramps, irritability, cravings/hunger, moodiness, you get it). They are way less intense. Anyone else experience this?

Beyond that, I haven't lost any weight beyond the 5 lbs I lost in the first 2 weeks. I haven't gained either so that's good. SW: 255 lbs CW: 250 lbs height: 5'5"".
I didn't do this strictly for weight loss, but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a huge motivator. I was so encouraged with those first lbs even though I knew it was water weight, but being at a standstill for a month and a half has me concerned.

Is this my body adjusting/healing? 
Am I eating too much/little? 
Generally looking for tips and guidance. I'm still a baby carnivore and I need some guidance. I'm watching the videos, following the tips, adding fat, removing it adding food, eating less. Idk what to do here. üòÖ

I have fallen in love with the Kaleido M10 and watched Mike from Virtual Coffee Lab roast a light roast. Everything came out nicely, but it's difficult for me to see how to know how to plan for what Mike did. As an engineer, I see Artisan graphs and the talk of rate of rise, RoR, and my mind starts racing to understand how I'd plan to do something like what Mike did.

I came up with a mathematical way of determining the ""optimal"" RoR path to drop, [A Mathematical Approach to Roast Profile Design](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B4rYmkRdjVlzCM0-YL47v_ehxnsw-FUmQoujZa4Rles/edit?usp=sharing). I say optimal in quotes because I solve it meeting certain requirements, but that doesn't mean it'll produce the optimal cup. I was able to use the fact that Kaleido roasters seem to reach the peak RoR at 2 minutes (other YouTuber runs as well all seemed to satisfy this) and splitting the desired RoR path into two parts. Once we know the peak RoR value and the BT at that time, I generate a desired RoR path, import it into Artisan and demonstrate showing as a background on your roast. I also show how to calculate the desired RoR path during a run and have a targeted RoR and BT to shoot for during the initial run with a new type of bean.

When I ask him why I am deeply saddened by his absence he says
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in love‚Äù
‚ÄúI love you, baby. Just like that, too.‚Äù 

And his voice sounds like the resonance of a church choir finishing a hymn about life and death. About the prosperous and the unfortunate. I kneel to pray, but at his feet. I am ravenous and a slave to his scent. I am intertwined in the way his back feels against my breasts when I hold him at night. I have never been brought to tears by the thought of a man, but they fall from my eyes like rain. He says my name and it pours out in buttery soft sounds as if he knows that he can make love with his voice; a spell that has wrapped me so tightly I can‚Äôt surrender to thoughtful action. 

I lift my shirt to reveal my breasts to him. Most times he lifts his shirt to touch his chest to mine. He has the most incredible hair on his chest; I adore my face pressed into him. I fear that my intensity of love for him is due to my feeling of him leaving me, for another. I am going to be 37 soon, he is 51. I know that the age gap might seem great, but I am blind to it now. When I first met him in person it was obvious, but now, I feel ancient with him. We‚Äôve known each other before in another life. 

This is what I tell myself, this is the blanket my heart weaves that keeps me warm at night when I‚Äôm not with him. 
 
I‚Äôd tell you here and now that I know a lot about obsession and a hearts deep yearning. I‚Äôve been to this familiar ground many times before... and I‚Äôll likely be here again until some underpaid asshole shovels dirt on my expensive box.

You must think ‚ÄúHow do you know that you love him?‚Äù 
All I know about this love is the tie that happened during intimacy. May as well have strapped a concrete block to my feet and pushed me into the Chicago River. Make it green like St. Patty‚Äôs Day. Green like envy. Green like yeast infections and money. For some time, I held interest in tarot and the metaphysical. I threw all my decks out and cursed the day I‚Äôd ever get my hands on one again. I had fallen into a spell of bad luck. No pun intended.  But I watch it on YouTube, because I‚Äôm a hypocrite. 

Hours upon hours upon hours of zodiac sign monthly pulls. 

‚ÄúWow! You won‚Äôt believe this Aquarius!‚Äù January 2025 Tarot - and the bitch of it is that there are people, me included, who believed and still do believe that it‚Äôs true. I watch them and wait for confirmation of what I want to hear. You guessed it, love. I want to hear about love. If I don‚Äôt resonate at all ‚Äì well ‚Äì I click off until I find something that speaks to what I want. 

If they even so much as mutter the sign of the man that I‚Äôm pining over ‚Äì I watch diligently until my eyes burn from the screen. Countless thieves roam the internet waiting for pathetic people like me to fall for their droll and sweep themselves away into paying for a personal reading. They collect on the pain sad people feel. 

News flash. 
We are all sad. 

When I was a young girl, my father always told me to ‚Äúshut the fuck up and stop whining‚Äù; it didn‚Äôt do anything for me other than make me sorry. To everyone and everything. Sorry for reacting appropriately, sorry when I don‚Äôt. Sorry when it has nothing to do with me at all. Sorry for sharing the same air in the same room on the same planet. Well, I‚Äôm an adult now and so much of that life is gone. I cut ties with the only relatives I have left recently, and I feel no sorrow. Nothing. Not a shrivel of a tear. I‚Äôve cried them all. Sadness has become me and is no longer a feeling that could touch me like kissing cousins on a prepubescent hunt.

I was married for 13 years before I announced I to the father of my children that divorce was imminent, and I didn‚Äôt feel a single thing other than relief; call me cold-hearted. I was tired of living a lie. I had been lying to myself mostly. 

The challenge for me now is that I am bombarded with debt. Financial, emotional, physical debt. I owe everyone something and I can‚Äôt get my bearings on any of it. From Lawyers to work to my apartment and my kids ‚Äì I‚Äôm a damn mess. I spoke with my therapist about ditching my parents and the guilt I feel with it; she says they are toxic people. 

They are without a doubt toxic people.

My Fathers birthday just passed like a freighter‚Äì and I looked back for a moment in recollection of the fear I had harnessed as a little girl not knowing if her mother was coming back. I was dropped off and told by my mother:

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just for a couple of weeks Mandy. I‚Äôll be back before you know it.‚Äù 

Choo ‚Äì Choo. 
She sang
‚ÄúMama comes back, she always comes back‚Äù in her sing song voice with her wretched stink breath and I knew then that I‚Äôd likely not see her for a long time. 

Choo ‚Äì Choo. 

She lost custody of my sister and I after her then boyfriend ‚Äì turned husband several years later ‚Äì beat the shit out of me for slamming the front door of the house as we ran in and out over and over and over 

Choo ‚Äì Choo.
Playing outside with our friends. I was in first grade.
I remember the sting of the slotted spoon and the sound of the scream from out of my mouth like I had been struck by a million buzzing bees. He wet the spoon before he beat me black and blue to make sure he flew the point straight home. 

Funny, only his anger landed.
Funny, only realizing later in life that I am the train.

I had to attend school the following morning, I showed the girl that lived next door to me what happened. Barbara was her name. My mother entrusted her to walk me sometimes in the morning.

Unbuttoning my pants and pulling them down to reveal my black and purple legs she took me to high school instead. I was interviewed by the nurse and taken from my mother and placed under my father‚Äôs care. He was a better option by far, don‚Äôt get me wrong. I am grateful that he did, but I didn‚Äôt like him. He was mean and didn‚Äôt carry an ounce of warmth in him that my little breaking heart needed. He wasn‚Äôt kind or compassionate to me - even then as a small broken girl.

My aunt told me when I was a bit older that I used to call him 
‚ÄúIcky Black Face‚Äù because he worked on a dock and was dirty all of the time. 
As I type this, I feel the guilt for my words ‚Äì but I‚Äôm cloaked in outrage for a life that wasn‚Äôt for me. I couldn‚Äôt have what other people had. 

The welcome I got to his house when he took custody was a shitty handmade mobile hanging off the ceiling fan. He got his just desserts when I pissed the bed nearly every night out of fear. I was reeling still from the pain of my mother leaving and the physical/sexual abuse I had endured while under her care. The same man who beat me to a bloody pulp also touched my little body as much as he wanted ‚Äì my own mother bearing witness. 

My father would wrap me in my blanket in the middle of the night so I wasn‚Äôt cold and wouldn‚Äôt feel the urine seeping through the sheets I just soiled. Night after night like clockwork I‚Äôd wake up to the damp cold until the damp cold became me.

You know, through the years I have heard in order to be a writer you need to read. I don‚Äôt read, though I try. Day to day I have many things going on ‚Äì so many that if I sat down to read, I‚Äôd have time for nothing else. I live in the Midwest and it is winter. I should be hunkered down and cozy in this beautiful couch that my boyfriend got me snuggled up with a book; or should I really? I‚Äôd rather fight the middle-aged woman norms and instead pace around the floor staring at everything I need to do 

Laundry? 
‚ÄúFuck you‚Äù I say to the pile staring at me in the corner. 

Scrub the bathroom? 
‚ÄúSoap scum thicker than the walls of my pussy‚Äù I say staring into my face in the mirror, shocked at my own audacity.

Breakthroughs ‚Äì not breakdowns! Progress doesn‚Äôt equal perfection. Fuck the police coming straight from the underground. 
And on and on are the nonsense thoughts swirling around a manic brain full of bloody kneed heartache.

I do all the cleaning simultaneously so that none of it actually gets completed to its potential. I have been counting the days until the warmth and the sun graces my back again, but it‚Äôs pained from being railed by the man who will be the death of me. He will be the death of me. 

It‚Äôs hard to believe that I have been in this new apartment for almost a month. It‚Äôs nothing to gaff at really, it‚Äôs tiny. It‚Äôs location leaves little to be desired but it‚Äôs not quite the worst parts of the city. I am dreaming of a Lake Michigan home somewhere near the Upper Peninsula in Michigan and wishing on every star that one day my dream will turn into a reality. I want to wake up to the sound of the wind sending waves crashing to the shore. I want to have my coffee on a humid morning staring out into the expanse of blue green heaven. I want to smell the fishy air and stick my tongue out as far as it can go so the falling rain drops aren‚Äôt jealous of my own squinty eyed anticipation. I close them and wait for the burst to come, and when it does I have to stop myself from gagging.

I can‚Äôt figure out sometimes if he‚Äôs coming or going. 

In reality, 
I want to build a web and stay in it.
I want to spin and spin and spin until I can catch anything I want. I want to continue to lie to myself and say that I‚Äôll write the book someday and maybe someone who is anyone will read it and think I‚Äôm not a wasted humanoid taking up space.

1hslyal,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrosDatingAdvice/comments/1hslyal/stop_being_a_secondary_character_in_your_own_life/,"Stop being a secondary character in your own life, and become the hero of your life's story!","Hi, David here!

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it‚Äôs time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero‚Äôs journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can‚Äôt even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don‚Äôt wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

I regularly take him to a coffee shop with me, and until recently he has always been excited about meeting new people and eager to say hello. 

  
A couple of weeks ago while at the coffee shop, an older lady approached him very tentatively, he was unsure about the situation and ended up backed into a corner (my fault, I should've taken control of the situation). He growled at the lady, but she kept pursuing an interaction which resulted in him barking and lunging at her. This is very out of character for him, but I'm certain it stemmed from the uncertainty of the interaction and lack of clear intentions. 

  
Now, whenever at the coffee shop he will growl and bark at people. Even people he has met before and has been comfortable with. 

  
I'm looking for advice on how best to handle the situation. I'd really like to get to a point where he is confident and outgoing again and I can feel comfortable taking him to the coffee shop / other public places. Currently I'm really worried about him potentially biting someone. ",1,1735909129.0,DogAdvice,1,1.0,False

When I ask him why I am deeply saddened by his absence he says
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in love‚Äù
‚ÄúI love you, baby. Just like that, too.‚Äù 

And his voice sounds like the resonance of a church choir finishing a hymn about life and death. About the prosperous and the unfortunate. I kneel to pray, but at his feet. I am ravenous and a slave to his scent. I am intertwined in the way his back feels against my breasts when I hold him at night. I have never been brought to tears by the thought of a man, but they fall from my eyes like rain. He says my name and it pours out in buttery soft sounds as if he knows that he can make love with his voice; a spell that has wrapped me so tightly I can‚Äôt surrender to thoughtful action. 

I lift my shirt to reveal my breasts to him. Most times he lifts his shirt to touch his chest to mine. He has the most incredible hair on his chest; I adore my face pressed into him. I fear that my intensity of love for him is due to my feeling of him leaving me, for another. I am going to be 37 soon, he is 51. I know that the age gap might seem great, but I am blind to it now. When I first met him in person it was obvious, but now, I feel ancient with him. We‚Äôve known each other before in another life. 

This is what I tell myself, this is the blanket my heart weaves that keeps me warm at night when I‚Äôm not with him. 
 
I‚Äôd tell you here and now that I know a lot about obsession and a hearts deep yearning. I‚Äôve been to this familiar ground many times before... and I‚Äôll likely be here again until some underpaid asshole shovels dirt on my expensive box.

You must think ‚ÄúHow do you know that you love him?‚Äù 
All I know about this love is the tie that happened during intimacy. May as well have strapped a concrete block to my feet and pushed me into the Chicago River. Make it green like St. Patty‚Äôs Day. Green like envy. Green like yeast infections and money. For some time, I held interest in tarot and the metaphysical. I threw all my decks out and cursed the day I‚Äôd ever get my hands on one again. I had fallen into a spell of bad luck. No pun intended.  But I watch it on YouTube, because I‚Äôm a hypocrite. 

Hours upon hours upon hours of zodiac sign monthly pulls. 

‚ÄúWow! You won‚Äôt believe this Aquarius!‚Äù January 2025 Tarot - and the bitch of it is that there are people, me included, who believed and still do believe that it‚Äôs true. I watch them and wait for confirmation of what I want to hear. You guessed it, love. I want to hear about love. If I don‚Äôt resonate at all ‚Äì well ‚Äì I click off until I find something that speaks to what I want. 

If they even so much as mutter the sign of the man that I‚Äôm pining over ‚Äì I watch diligently until my eyes burn from the screen. Countless thieves roam the internet waiting for pathetic people like me to fall for their droll and sweep themselves away into paying for a personal reading. They collect on the pain sad people feel. 

News flash. 
We are all sad. 

When I was a young girl, my father always told me to ‚Äúshut the fuck up and stop whining‚Äù; it didn‚Äôt do anything for me other than make me sorry. To everyone and everything. Sorry for reacting appropriately, sorry when I don‚Äôt. Sorry when it has nothing to do with me at all. Sorry for sharing the same air in the same room on the same planet. Well, I‚Äôm an adult now and so much of that life is gone. I cut ties with the only relatives I have left recently, and I feel no sorrow. Nothing. Not a shrivel of a tear. I‚Äôve cried them all. Sadness has become me and is no longer a feeling that could touch me like kissing cousins on a prepubescent hunt.

I was married for 13 years before I announced I to the father of my children that divorce was imminent, and I didn‚Äôt feel a single thing other than relief; call me cold-hearted. I was tired of living a lie. I had been lying to myself mostly. 

The challenge for me now is that I am bombarded with debt. Financial, emotional, physical debt. I owe everyone something and I can‚Äôt get my bearings on any of it. From Lawyers to work to my apartment and my kids ‚Äì I‚Äôm a damn mess. I spoke with my therapist about ditching my parents and the guilt I feel with it; she says they are toxic people. 

They are without a doubt toxic people.

My Fathers birthday just passed like a freighter‚Äì and I looked back for a moment in recollection of the fear I had harnessed as a little girl not knowing if her mother was coming back. I was dropped off and told by my mother:

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just for a couple of weeks Mandy. I‚Äôll be back before you know it.‚Äù 

Choo ‚Äì Choo. 
She sang
‚ÄúMama comes back, she always comes back‚Äù in her sing song voice with her wretched stink breath and I knew then that I‚Äôd likely not see her for a long time. 

Choo ‚Äì Choo. 

She lost custody of my sister and I after her then boyfriend ‚Äì turned husband several years later ‚Äì beat the shit out of me for slamming the front door of the house as we ran in and out over and over and over 

Choo ‚Äì Choo.
Playing outside with our friends. I was in first grade.
I remember the sting of the slotted spoon and the sound of the scream from out of my mouth like I had been struck by a million buzzing bees. He wet the spoon before he beat me black and blue to make sure he flew the point straight home. 

Funny, only his anger landed.

I am honestly very tired of dating apps having tried almost all of them ( like league, raya, hinge) just to meet infinite amount of people only looking for hookups or short term relationships (whatever that means). 

About me:


I am 5‚Äô7, slim build, brunette. I was told I have an elegant fashion style. 


I speak 5 languages fluently and lived in 3 countries.


I graduate from med school in a couple months! 


I have a profound love for cooking dishes from all cuisines:  I go to new restaurants and try to recreate that dish at home


I got into baking during covid and most recently made Japanese strawberry shortcake and shokupan!


I am pretty energetic: love playing tennis, running, long walks, hiking, pilates, yoga.


I have a pretty dark sense of humor so you should let me know if you are not into that üíÄ


Other things I love are going to music festivals, shopping, spending time with cats and dogs, reading, lots of coffee and matcha, bar hopping, wine tasting, taking cute pictures and of course long peaceful naps.



What is the type of person I am looking for? 
Someone who is 28-32 years old, east or southeast asian, >6‚Äô0, slim or muscular build, preferably in STEM, med or law fields. 


It is ok if you don‚Äôt have exactly same interests as me because I would love you to introduce me into things I haven‚Äôt done before as well ü´∂üèª 


I don‚Äôt mind starting a LDR once we know each other well and of course meet IRL with the intent of closing the gap. 


And I know some things I wrote here might seem superficial but I just want to be with someone who I am attracted both physically and personally. It doesn‚Äôt mean I consider people who don‚Äôt have these characteristics are ugly. It just means I have a type and I don‚Äôt wanna lead someone on who is not and waste their time.

1hslqwf,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1hslqwf/sexy_steampunk_babes_chapter_fifty_five/,Sexy Steampunk Babes: Chapter Fifty Five,"The conditions for dream-meetings between mages weren‚Äôt complex. Physical contact while both individuals slept was really all that was needed. Such meetings of minds had to have a host though.

It was a reasonably coveted position. Dreams in and of themselves weren‚Äôt usually pleasant places to be for *conscious*¬†minds. The landscape was nebulous and ever shifting, while the objects and creatures within tended to be warped in ways that were both unsubtle and unsettling.

To be the host provided one some level of protection against that sensation. It was, after all, one‚Äôs own mind. And while the sensation of having an ‚Äòinvader‚Äô in such a hallowed place could provide some level of discomfort for some, it was generally accepted that it was better to meet a stranger in a familiar place, than to be the wanderer in an alien and sometimes hostile landscape.

*Fortunately, hostile, doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean dangerous*, William thought as he sat at his ‚Äòdesk‚Äô.

Discomforting and sometimes frightening, yes, but at the end of the day this was still little more than a dream. The denizens within could do no real harm.

*Well, with one notable exception,* William thought as he very deliberately didn‚Äôt glance back at the *thing* hovering over his shoulder.

‚ÄúFuck me, would it have killed you to think up a hallway?‚Äù A familiar voice grunted as the woman it belonged to physically pulled herself through the doorway to his office.

‚ÄúI thought I had?‚Äù he responded.

‚ÄúWell, think a little harder on the subject next time. Because getting through the ‚Äòestate‚Äô was a bitch because most of the rooms don‚Äôt connect to the rooms they‚Äôre supposed to. I had to get in here through the kitchen. A kitchen with floors that my feet kept sinking into.‚Äù

‚ÄúNoted,‚Äù William deadpanned as he fully took in the creature that had just stepped into his office.

And it was a creature, for all that it held Xela‚Äôs voice and carried her consciousness.

Looking not totally unlike a wendigo of myth, if lacking the usual skull-face, Xela‚Äôs dreamform was more than a little unsettling to look at as she walked over to his desk.

‚ÄúFuck me though, I know you‚Äôre supposed to be an old soul and shit, but I didn‚Äôt think you were being literal,‚Äù she continued, hot breath wafting over his face from her massive maw as she leaned down to examine him.

For his part, he knew he looked like George. Right down to the liver spots that had started to develop in his later years. Personally, he thought it was a better dreamform than most got.

Marline had more or less been herself, albeit with features so angular that she‚Äôd looked like some kind of‚Ä¶ sword person in the most uncanny of ways. Piper had been herself - if someone had doused her with acid and set her on fire. And while the flames she‚Äôd given off had been quite pretty given the exotic colors involved, it still hadn‚Äôt been pleasant to see the flesh constantly melting off her.

By contrast, him appearing as an old man when he was barely twenty ‚Äòin reality‚Äô seemed positively mundane to his sensibilities.

‚ÄúYes, well there‚Äôs a reason for that,‚Äù he deadpanned. ‚ÄúOne that‚Äôs slightly more complex than whatever kind of body-image issue you‚Äôve got going on.‚Äù

‚ÄúBody image issue?‚Äù Xela scoffed. ‚ÄúMy dreamform‚Äôs great!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre drooibbling onto my carpet.‚Äù He deliberately didn‚Äôt look at the copious stream of‚Ä¶ fluid running down the woman‚Äôs leg from her‚Ä¶ oversized genitals.

Again, he had to remind himself that this was a dream - things tended to get Freudian even when the participants hadn‚Äôt just had sex. Indeed, said ‚Äòstream‚Äô was likely a dream-like manifestation of sensations Xela‚Äôs body was still experiencing in the ‚Äòreal world‚Äô.

Something Xela clearly knew as well as she eyed him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd say that‚Äôs as much your fault as mine.‚Äù

Well, he couldn‚Äôt argue that. Fortunately, he wasn‚Äôt here to argue with her about who had stuffed whom with which fluids.

He was here to get a geass formed. As evidenced by the second creature that was hovering over Xela‚Äôs shoulder. One he was avoiding looking at as much as he was his own. Just as Xela wasn‚Äôt looking at his.

After all, it was considered good sense amongst mages not to look at the fae. In the same way it was generally considered good sense not to stare at the sun. It tended to have a deleterious effect on the viewer.

As a single glance at the spinning rotoscope behind Xela confirmed. Because it wasn‚Äôt a rotoscope. It was a dragon. Made of squares with seven sides that sounded like purple-

He tore his gaze away.

Yes, it was good dream etiquette not to look at the fae.

""Fair enough. Shall we move on to the real reason we‚Äôre here?"" William asked as he rose from his desk, only to find himself standing in a field.

""Fuck me. I hate when that happens,"" Xela muttered.

William, however, barely registered the change. One of the perks of being the host‚Äîthe transitions were smoother, less jarring. Especially since this shift hadn‚Äôt been deliberate. His mind had simply decided the new setting was more appropriate and he‚Äôd not consciously thought to stop it.

""If you hate it, close your eyes. This‚Äôll be the last transition, I promise.""

Xela didn‚Äôt argue. She simply shut her inhuman eyes with a mutter.

William smiled, and a moment later, they stood in the midst of a familiar scene - a small outdoor caf√© from George‚Äôs hometown. The hum of passing cars filled the previously unnoticed silence while the rich aroma of food from nearby kitchens mingled with the tang of exhaust fumes. His fingers brushed against the texture of the table he now sat at, only then noticing that the desk he‚Äôd been sat at before lacked it. Likewise, he could suddenly feel the pull of gravity anchoring him to the chair.

Details, thousands of them, suddenly came into focus - each one more vivid than the last due to their absence.

Xela noticed it too. Slowly, she opened her eyes, blinking at the unfamiliar yet tangible world around her. Her fingers reached out to touch the fabric of the caf√©'s closed table mounted umbrella.

""It feels... real,"" she murmured, taking in the vibrant colors and branding adorned to the fabric.

‚ÄúYep,‚Äù he agreed.

It wasn‚Äôt, but unlike the liminal space they‚Äôd occupied just moments ago, this place could be mistaken for the real thing.

He‚Äôd made that mistake a few times. When he was ‚Äòyoung‚Äô. Never for long, fortunately, but there‚Äôd been a few moments in which he thought he had‚Ä¶ returned.

Because this wasn‚Äôt just some rough imitation of the world cobbled together from imperfect human memory. Or at least, not just human memory alone.

The fae hung over his shoulder and he ignored it.

Even if it was the true architect of this scene. Earth - rendered in more depth and detail than any human mind could ever fully process. Albeit, with a catch. Said catch being the reason he‚Äôd never believed the lie of this place for long.

William‚Äôs eyes drifted to a nearby table, where a cup of coffee shifted slightly, as if moved by an invisible hand. He also knew that if he looked through the windows of a passing car, he wouldn‚Äôt see a driver behind the wheel.

This world was perfect in every detail - except for the lack of people. Or animals.

*At least, any living ones,* he thought as a tray floated over to deposit a plate full of bacon and eggs in front of him.

Morgues likewise had occupants as he‚Äôd discovered on one particularly morbid fact finding mission.

‚Ä¶Graveyards too.

""So, this is where your harrowed knowledge comes from,"" Xela finally said, taking in the scene around her.

Credit where it was due‚Äîshe looked only mildly surprised. Which, under normal circumstances, might seem incredible, considering the sheer wonder surrounding her. But one had to remember the world she came from.

Back home, technology resembling this existed, though in far cruder forms. More importantly, she had grown up in a place where the existence of other worlds‚Äîsome more advanced, others less so‚Äîwas an accepted truth.

Harrowed knowledge often came from those other realms, extracted from different races and civilizations. And while those who returned with such knowledge were rarely left coherent enough to describe those worlds in any meaningful way beyond fragmented, maddened ramblings, the fact of their existence was never in question.

Many of those worlds were far stranger than this one.

That, at least partially, explained why William remained sane despite everything.

Still, there was a flicker of awe in her eyes as she watched a bus rumble by.

""You‚Äôre not wrong,"" William said, taking a sip of his coffee. Dream or not, it still tasted good.

""So, you‚Äôre just admitting it now?""

""You already suspected.‚Äù He placed the cup down. ‚ÄúYou would‚Äôve pieced it together even if I hadn‚Äôt shown you all this. Besides, this is actually more convenient. I can show you things in here without having to go through the hassle of dragging you all the way back to the estate.""

As he spoke, a **Vought F4U Corsair**¬†appeared across the street, materializing out of thin air. The cars on the road adjusted seamlessly to its appearance, navigating around the new obstacle without missing a beat.

""That‚Äôs‚Ä¶"" Xela began.

""Remarkably similar to what I have your people practicing with?"" William finished for her.

""Aye,‚Äù she said tentatively. ‚ÄúDoes it have a core?‚Äù She eyed a passing car. ‚ÄúDo those... land-shards?""

""Nope. I‚Äôll spare you the technical details, but suffice to say it runs on an alchemical process, somewhat like a lantern. Unlike aether, though, the fumes it produces aren‚Äôt lighter than air, so it can‚Äôt hover.""

Once more, he was reminded of the fact that ‚Äòprimitive did not mean stupid‚Äô as the elf quickly turned his words into actionable intelligence. ""Which is why you‚Äôve had your plebeians practicing take-offs and landings on solid ground.""

""Exactly.""

‚Äú‚Ä¶Do those cores require mages?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù He eyed her. ‚ÄúThey do not.‚Äù

The elf sighed. ‚ÄúFuck. That‚Äôs going to upset some people back home.‚Äù

He shrugged. ‚ÄúI imagine it will. The fact that plebeians might soon be able to lay claim to the title of pilot where it was once relegated to mages alone. I suppose they‚Äôll have to content themselves with the ability to fly on command, heal with a touch and the ability to fling elemental death at anything that happens to annoy them.‚Äù

Xela snorted at his words, but it was clear she was thinking. William was content to let her, simply enjoying the ambience.

This wasn‚Äôt home. No matter how much it looked like it. But he‚Äôd be lying if he claimed he‚Äôd not spent many a proverbial ‚Äòday‚Äô here simply‚Ä¶ indulging his nostalgia.

‚ÄúHow are you not insane?‚Äù Xela asked after a few minutes. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre harrowed. You should be either flinging shit at the walls or dribbling in a room somewhere.‚Äù

""That‚Äôs your question?"" William asked, a smirk tugging at the corner of his mouth. ""You‚Äôre not curious about a vehicle that can fly without a mithril core?""

Xela waved a hand, dismissive but with a flicker of curiosity in her eyes. ""Oh, I‚Äôm interested in it. Very interested. But at the end of the day, a tool is just that. A tool. It‚Äôs simply a new way of doing what we already do. What matters, in the here and now, is the intent of the person holding said tool.‚Äù

William chuckled softly, a little taken aback by the display of insight from the normally brusque woman.

""Fair enough,‚Äù he murmured as he leaned back, the chair creaking under him as if acknowledging the shift in mood. ""As for *how* I‚Äôm not insane‚Ä¶ well, I‚Äôve never *not*¬†been harrowed. I imagine that helped with the transition. That, and luck, I suppose.""

A brief thought crossed his mind as he considered how lucky he‚Äôd been, and for a moment he found himself wondering if, in this world, sudden infant death syndrome was just a side effect of kids harrowing in their dreams without realizing it.

Because that was‚Ä¶ grim.

Mentally shaking said thought off, he instead gestured around them, his hand sweeping over the bustling street and the sound of engines rumbling in the distance. ""This is a human world. I‚Äôm a human. The technology is human. The vector by which it was implanted in my mind was also human.""

Xela‚Äôs eyes followed his hand, lingering on the seamless flow of traffic, the hum of the city blending with the faint clatter of cups in the caf√©.

After a pause, she said, ""You could win the civil war easily. Hold off the Lunites and Solites indefinitely.""

Ah, now they were shifting to a topic he was more comfortable with, and the corner of his mouth curled into a knowing smile. ""True. But I‚Äôm aiming a little higher than that.""

She raised an eyebrow, worried. ""Higher? How much higher?""

""Ending slavery is just the start,"" William said, his voice low but steady. ""At this point? I want the only way I can see the human/orc conflict ending is through the orcs having their own homeland. They've been fighting over that same stretch of land for so long now that neither side will ever know peace until it‚Äôs settled once and for all.""

Either with one side dead, or one side gone.

And while there was plenty of space for humans in the rest of Lindholm, the same wasn‚Äôt true of orcs. Or at least, not the Northern tribes.

‚Ä¶With that said, it definitely rankled that his plan called for the creation of what was essentially an ethno-state. Creating an orc homeland sounded a lot nicer than societal segregation.

Still, that was the best solution his engineer brain could come up with. Neither side would back down ‚Äì and one side had nowhere else to go.

Xela‚Äôs expression darkened. ""The Blackstones will *never*¬†give their home up.""

Her tone was sharp, certain.

""Exactly,"" William said, his gaze heavy with a mix of resignation and calculation. ""Which is why it‚Äôs convenient they‚Äôve positioned themselves to be crushed as a House. Once they‚Äôre gone and done, a new power will need to step into the vacuum.‚Äù

And he intended to be that power. Temporarily at least.

Xela leaned back slightly, arms crossed, considering. ""Still‚Ä¶ as far as I can see, all of this keeps you in line with the Queen‚Äôs interests.""

William barked out a short laugh. ""Not really. Freeing the orcs means carving off a piece of her kingdom. A not insignificant chunk at that. The Queen would *never*¬†agree to it.""

Oh, she was in favor of ending the slave trade, but only because it served to free up more manpower for her. His plan would do the same, but it would also lose her a large chunk of territory.

""Even if you handed her solution to all her problems on a silver platter?"" Xela asked, her brow furrowing in challenge.

""Coming from someone harrowed, any help I offer wouldn‚Äôt be seen as *aid*¬†\- it‚Äôd just be a resource being exploited. Something to drain me of before I inevitably expire, lost in my own delusions."" His voice turned cold for a moment, a bitterness surfacing before he pushed it down. ""And the amount of tech I‚Äôd need to give her to win this war could only come from a harrowed person.‚Äù

He thought of his new territory. ‚ÄúWhich is why I‚Äôm building myself up instead. Making my own powerbase. So when it becomes obvious to everyone that I‚Äôm harrowed, I‚Äôll be in a position where I can‚Äôt be ignored or dismissed as just another madman with a few tricks up his sleeve.‚Äù

And that time wouldn‚Äôt be long in coming now. A single aircraft carrier and forty planes would have been insignificant back on Earth ‚Äì here though? It was a force multiplier beyond compare. Not enough to decide any fleet engagement by itself, but the¬†*Jellyfish* would provide any fleet it was part of a significant advantage.

Indeed, in his mind‚Äôs eye, despite the Queen‚Äôs doom and gloom on the subject, he considered the civil war practically won already now that the¬†*Jellyfish* and his Corsair fleet¬†was near completion. Between that and giving Yelena access to his gunpowder recipe, new mithril cores, and radio, the Royal Fleet would have a clear technological edge in any fleet engagement.

The Blackstones and New Haven? They were already finished. They just didn‚Äôt know it yet.

The real game wasn‚Äôt about winning the war‚Äîit was about what came after. Which was why his focus was on positioning himself to profit from the peace that followed, not propping up a monarch who might one day stand in his way.

Xela didn‚Äôt need to know all of that. Not yet. Not until she was committed to his side, locked in so tightly she couldn‚Äôt back out.

As he watched, the woman tilted her head, her eyes narrowing thoughtfully. ""Alright,"" she said at last. ""I don‚Äôt love any of this. I spent plenty of time fighting orcs myself back when I was in the navy, and the thought of just‚Ä¶ handing over a chunk of the kingdom to them sits ill with me. But I‚Äôm sworn to you.‚Äù She shrugged, a resigned sort of acceptance. ""Mostly at this point I‚Äôm just glad to know I‚Äôve not been wasting my time teaching plebs to fly.‚Äù

Well, that was good to know. Even if it wasn‚Äôt quite the resounding cry of support he‚Äôd been hoping for.

He nearly said as much, before he saw the wood elf‚Äôs lips curl into a sly smile as she leaned forward. ""Now come on. Enough heavy stuff. Think you can conjure us some skies to fly that beast through without melting your brain? You can tell me all about how this engine of yours works while we do.""

William grinned, standing as the world around them shifted. The caf√© dissolved, replaced by the familiar sight of a long, sunlit runway stretching into the horizon, the scent of jet fuel sharp in the air.

""I think I can manage that,"" he said, his eyes glinting with anticipation.

¬†

‚Äî------------------

¬†

Xela was in a good mood as she stepped out of the carriage.

She found as the morning wore on, that she‚Äôd gone from feeling tepid about William‚Äôs plebeian pilot plan, to almost excited. Her concerns with his schemes aside, she couldn‚Äôt deny that she was excited to be part of something so‚Ä¶ groundbreaking.

With that said, as she felt something akin to an itch between her legs, she found she did have a question.

‚ÄúSo, all the other stuff aside, now that I‚Äôm ‚Äòone of your women‚Äô,‚Äù she said casually. ‚ÄúI suppose we should get around to getting us all together to divide shit up?‚Äù

The boy paused, frozen on the doorstep of his home.

‚Äú‚ÄòUs?‚Äô Divide ‚Äòshit‚Äô up?‚Äù he asked, obviously completely clueless as to what - or rather who - they were talking about.

The wood elf smiled. ‚ÄúWho gets which days? Birthing order? How many other women we‚Äôre going to allow in? Actually, do you think I could argue that the twins, as a pair, should have to share a day?‚Äù

It was amusing, the way the color drained from his face at her words.

Clearly, despite being very familiar with a woman‚Äôs body, he‚Äôd not much experience with actual relationships.

It was actually nice to know in a way. Under all that Imperial scheming, there was still a flesh and blood mortal. Because, possible harrowing induced insanity aside, she found to her surprise that she did want to stick around for a while.

Before, her duties to the boy had mostly just been a job and residual loyalty to a community that she‚Äôd called home for years.

Now?

Now she wanted to see what happened going forward. Whether this mad scheme worked out or whether it all ended in tears.

In which case, she fully intended to shield Redwater as best she could.

‚Ä¶And maybe get a few more ‚Äòdates‚Äô before it all goes to shit.

*After all, everyone knows the crazy ones are the best in the sack,*¬†she thought as she sashayed through the door - leaving her speechless employer behind.

I understand this explanation makes me sounds ungrateful and maybe Im the issue so another perspective would be great. I‚Äôve been apprenticing since November 2023 and actually tattooing on skin since august 2024. I‚Äôve decided this studio is not right for me (F) and now I‚Äôm dreading coming into work due to the studio owner. It‚Äôs a private studio with me, another apprentice (F) and him(owner/mentor). I find the owner to be very invasive and I think he sees us as more then work colleagues, he constantly buys me things after I say no and is very pushy eg asks me what I want such as coffee/lunch which I always say ‚Äòthanks for offering but I‚Äôm ok‚Äô however he doesn‚Äôt accept this answer and he will keep asking multiple times or will say ‚ÄòI‚Äôm going to get you it anyway so you might aswell tell me‚Äô until I give in or get mad.  this happens at least three times a week. I think he sees me as a child but I‚Äôm actually in my mid twenties and feel it to be very patronising I‚Äôve told him I can buy my own things however I think he enjoys being able to feel like he‚Äôs done something for someone else as he always will say ‚Äòwow I‚Äôm such a good boss aren‚Äôt I?‚Äô As he‚Äôs giving me whatever he‚Äôs bought. We‚Äôre in a private studio that is very small so he constantly talks which makes it very hard to get on with drawing as he struggles to sit without having a conversation and usually only has one customer a day so we have hours where he just wants to sit and talk. I don‚Äôt mind talking sometimes but I need to focus to draw which I‚Äôve told him before but it‚Äôs made no difference. I think the lack of people and space in the studio means I can‚Äôt get a break either as we‚Äôre literally sat next to eachother constantly which leads to me getting annoyed (I admit it‚Äôs probably abit over the top of a reaction but when it‚Äôs constant everyday it adds up). I went through a really personal family situation two months ago and didn‚Äôt come in for two weeks. I told him I wasn‚Äôt comfortable talking about it but even now he still asks me what happened which i find disrespectful as I‚Äôve already told him multiple times that I appreciate his concern but it‚Äôs extremely private and im not comfortable discussing. I understand I sound very moody and that he‚Äôs only trying to be nice and I do find that but it seems like he will not respect my consent, once you‚Äôve told someone no multipule times and they don‚Äôt listen it gets on your nerves and now I think I‚Äôve gained this annoyance, I‚Äôm just not enjoying going in anymore. At the end of this I‚Äôm just not happy here, the private studio lacks opportunities to find clients as we don‚Äôt do walk-ins so I‚Äôm already limited with my work. I‚Äôm now wondering what to do, how do you move studios? Will another studio even accept a apprentice of a year? what should I say to another studio? Do I just need to get over it and stop being so sensitive and carry on if I want to continue? I‚Äôm feeling abit stuck right now üòû",2,1735908348.0,TattooApprentice,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôve been brewing coffee with a V60 for the past year or two, sticking mostly to the base Hoffman recipe. I buy freshly roasted beans and grind them at home, but I‚Äôm currently using a¬†**DeLonghi KG 521 M Dedica grinder**. To be honest, I‚Äôve never seen anyone use this grinder for pour-overs, so I‚Äôm not sure how much it‚Äôs holding me back. I also only have a standard electric kettle‚Äîno temperature or flow control.

That said, most mornings, I‚Äôm quite happy with the results, and my coffee tastes on par with what I‚Äôd get from a good local caf√©.

1. **Upgrade the grinder**¬†‚Äì I‚Äôm considering the¬†**Ode Gen 2**, especially since I share my current grinder with my girlfriend, who uses it for espresso. Switching beans and settings all the time is a hassle, and I‚Äôd love a dedicated grinder for my pour-overs.

1hsloej,https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1hsloej/feeling_much_better_after_probiotics/,Feeling much better after probiotics (Saccharomyces boulardii),"Long story short:

Currently aged 36, my problems started 6 years ago after treatment with Zinnat (cefuroxim) for a respiratory tract infection. A few months later I also took Asentra (sertraline, an SSRI) for anxiety.

The symptoms changed over time, with ups and downs, but what has stayed is hypermotility in the mornings, soft stools (often type 5 and yellowish in colour, sometimes 4 or 6), constant bloating & burping, and brain fog. These are made worse by late evening meals, as well as lactose, apples, pears, oranges, heavy fats, carbonated drinks, sorbitol, excess sugar etc. A gastroenterologist called it IBS, but didn't mention SIBO - I read about that online, and have been lurking on this subreddit.

3 years ago I gradually started feeling much worse and this lasted for several months, including heavy tiredness, weight loss and mild neurological symptoms like peripheral neuropathy. A blood test showed gluten intolerance. After a couple of months on a gluten elimination diet, the symptoms went back from 'terrible' to the standard 'bad', although the sensitivity to specific foods got worse, notably for lactose. 1 year ago I also started having bad trouble immediately after drinking alcohol, even in small amounts.

I have no other relevant health conditions besides chronically low vitamin D, high serum calcium, and a somewhat hyperactive parathyroid. I have a stressful corporate job with long hours and a hectic pace.

During these 6 years I did three courses of Normix (rifaximin) + Levurin (Saccharomyces boulardii) taken at once. For some reason, after initial mild improvements, things got even worse during these treatments, the last of which I had to discontinue.

Other than that I tried to limit problematic foods and take supplements like vitamin D. But in the end there were many mornings when I had bad surprises, and it never felt like I had control over the condition. Rather, I ended up deciding many aspects of my life around it (for instance to avoid early-morning travel and meetings).

This Christmas I overindulged in dairy products, fats and even a few glasses of alcohol and I felt terrible afterwards (type 7 for three days). I decided to try a treatment again, but this time staying away from antibiotics and just doing probiotics.

It's been a week on a daily dose of Bactiol Duo (Saccharomyces boulardii + Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium lactis Bi-07, Lactobacillus paracasei Lpc-37 and Bifidobacterium lactis Bi-04, and blackberry extract) and every day I feel better and better, much like 6 years ago before all of this started. The constant feeling of pressure in my bowels is gone, and there is no pressing urge to head for the toilet within one hour of waking up, even after having coffee. The urge comes more naturally during the day, and stool is type 3. Some of the brain fog is still there, but I feel much more optimistic overall.

I just hope this lasts after the two-week course is over, but I'm in such a good mood that I already wanted to report.",2,1735908308.0,SIBO,4,1.0,False

I'm 19, and my life feels like it's all just shadows. I'm sick, I can't go out, and it's left me friendless - how could I have friends without the money to do anything together? I'm not here asking for work; I've tried things online, but each attempt just leaves me feeling worse.  
I've never tasted an McDonald's Happy Meal, or felt the warmth of a movie theater, or even just the comfort of a coffee with someone. These small joys, which are normal for so many of you, are just unreachable dreams for me.   
My question is: have you ever felt this isolated, this far from life's simple pleasures? Why does it seem like the world is built for those with resources, not for those without? I'm not asking for money, but just if you can remember what it was like when you had nothing, and maybe, just maybe, someone changed your day with a small gesture.  
I don't want you telling me to ""try harder"" or ""do more,"" because who more than me would want to be able to do that? I just want you to think - what would you do if you were in my shoes, without a friend, without a meal out, without a shared moment of joy?  
If you've ever experienced this loneliness, if you remember how a small act of kindness made a difference, would you share it? I'm not asking for money, but if you feel in your heart that you should do something, perhaps you can find your own way to show kindness.

He met his old friends there, someone had become an engineer, the other one a teacher and someone was just living off the rent he received from the building that his father made. Yogesh and his friends celebrated a lot as this was Holi time! Every night they all used to assemble at one place, nearly 5 of them, and used to barbeque and talk about their childhood stories. During one such meeting, one of my friends Sujon said ""Do you guys remember the time when we stole the cigarette boxes from PT sir's house?"". Everyone agreed and started laughing. One of the other friends Jatin said ""Hey, hey what was his name?"". Yogesh said, ""Aree, it was Ikbaal sir ! he used to smoke a lot, imagine a physical training teacher smoking cigarettes!"". Sujon said ""Physical training teacher my ass, he was so fat, and he used to coach the athletics team, a 4th grader could run faster than him"". Jatin said ""Hey Yogesh you studied in our school for like 2 years right?"" to which Yogesh replied, ""Yes, when I was 14 and 15, then I left for Kharagpur"". Jatin said ""Does he still live here?"" Yogesh said ""Who?"" to which Jatin replied,d ""Ikbaal sir, we went to his house which is Beyonsutta pattyty for inviting him for bhoj, I think he still lives there"". Sujon said, ""No, he doesn't live there anymore I guess"". Yogesh said, ""Let's go and see !"". Jatin said ""Now?"". Sujon said, ""It's 8 pm, there would be no one even on the streets, we'll go tomorrow for sure"". Yogesh said, ""Yes that would be better"". All three friends met the next morning and left for Suttapatty. They were wandering around the road looking at houses. Yogesh said ""Wow, this place has changed completely, the road is still in bad condition but man the houses have grown too big."". Sujon said ""I heard that Ikbaal sir once won the election of ward member"" to which Jatin replied 'That is why the streets are so bad"". They found Ikbaal sir's house, but the house was abandoned . Yogesh looked at the board of the house and it read, ""Mr. Ikbaal Singh"". Jatin said ""hey, I think the bank has taken in this house, maybe he mortgaged the house and failed to pay the loan back"". Sujon said ""But the gates are open"". Yogesh saw a newspaper guy going through the streets. He stopped the guy and said ""Sir, do you know the PT teacher who used to live here?"". The guy replied ""yes, he and his family went to Amritsar around 10 years ago"". Jatin said ""He sold this house? or the bank has taken it"". The guy said ""Bank took it, he was fighting a case. He lost everything due to that case. Even his own house"". Sujon said ""What case?"". The guy said ""Sir, its 7 am, I can't be late, meet me in my shop today at 10 pm and I will tell you everything because I am free at that time"". Yogesh said ""Can we go inside the house?"". The guy said ""Yes yes you can, it is a place where people come to drink now, the bank couldn't sell it."". Jatin said ""Ok bhaiya, we will come to your shop, thank you"". The newspaper guy left. Sujon said to Yogesh ""Why do you want to go inside?"". Jatin said ""Thats right, we don't have drinks"". Yogesh said to Jatin ""What?"", Jatin said ""This is a place of party"". Sujon said ""This is the place of drunkards !"", to which Jatin said ""Drunkards are nothing but people who party a bit hard and that too everyday, they are a much more evolved version of us, thats it ! "". Yogesh laughed and so did Sujon. Sujon said ""We can't drink right now, we'll come during the evening"". Yogesh said ""No, we don't know what happens during evening in this place, those drunkards might even be criminals, lets do this right now!"". Jatin said ""If a journalist tells me to stay away from a place, I do so, I am a basic bitch, lets get the drinks!"". They opened the gate of the house. The entire house was empty, there were just a few chairs in the drawing room and some beer bottles thrown around. The three men started partying inside the old teacher's house. Jatin took out a cigarette and asked sujon ""Hey do you have a lighter?"", Sujon said, ""No, see around, there are cigarette butts here, check the cupboards"". Jatin opened the cupboard, the cupboard had a matchbox, jatin took it out and lighted a cigarette and the matchbox fell out of his hand and went below the cupboard. Yogesh took a cigarette from the box and said to Jatin ""Where did you keep the matchbox?"". Jatin said, ""It is on the floor, below the cupboard"". Yogesh looked below the cupboard and found the matchbox, but he also saw a diary thrown there, he picked it up. Sujon said, ""What is it?"". Yogesh said ""Ikbaal sir's diary I guess"" and Yogesh opened the diary when someone entered the house. There were 5 men with plastic bags in their hands. They looked at the 3 friends and said ""Who are you guys?"". Jatin said, ""We live nearby, we thought this place was empty so we came here to drink"". The guy said, ""This is our place, leave quickly or wait for us to take 1 shot, and then we will have some fun together"". Sujon got up from his chair and said ""Sorry bhaiya, we will leave"". The 3 friends ran out of the house. Yogesh still had the diary in his hand. Jatin said, ""Bro, my mood is over, lets go home, we will meet tonight again"". All the three men left for their houses. Yogesh went to his house, showered, and wore fresh clothes. He then brewed some coffee for himself opened his laptop computer and started working, his eyes went to Ikbaal sir's diary. He picked it up and started reading it. The first few pages of the diary had the list of ikbaal sir's houses ration. Yogesh smiled looking at those items and he put the diary down and started working again. During the evening of the same day, the three friends met again. Sujon said, ""Hey, what was in that diary Yogesh?"". Yogesh replied ""Ikbaal sir's ration list"". Jatin laughed and said, ""Mofo would've bought the entire shop's inventory"". Sujon said,d ""You still have issues with him?"". Jatin replied, ""Yes ! He slapped me so hard in front of the entire school and blamed me for hiding a schoolteacher's kid or something. Thank god the principal saved me."". Sujonsaida, id ""Forgive, him man, we don't even know whether he is alive or not."". Yogesh said, ""Hey let's go to the newspaper guys' shop, he was going to tell us about ikbaal sir"". Jatin said,d ""Naah, I don't think his shop would be open, it'6 pmpm."". Sujon said, ""It would be, and we are free, let's go, we will chat"". All three got up and left for the newspaper guys' shop. The man was sitting in his shop. Yogesh said,d ""Bro, it's not a newspaper shop, it's a whole stationary shop"". Jatin said, id ""Yeah, the man was being humble in the morning ! True signs of a successful businessman"". The guy looked at the 3 guys and said ""How can I help you ?"". Sujon s, aid ""bhaiya we met today, and you told us that you would tell us about ikbaal sir"". The ma, said, ""Oh, yes yes I remember. Sit"". The three friends sat and the man got out of his shop and sat in front of them on a stool and started his story. He said, ""There is a school named Anand Vidya Mandir. Ikbaal sir was a teacher there."". Jatin said, ""Yes, we have studied there"". The guy said ""ok, so listen. During a children's day mela, a child went missing in the school. Ikbaal sir was blamed for it because the teacher and ikbaal sir had some issues with each other. So the teacher along with the school filed a case against Ikbaal sir, ikbaal sir fought the case to his maximum limit but ultimately he lost and he was sentenced to 10 years of jail time."". Sujon said ""aAndwhat happened with that kid who got lost?"". The man said ""He was found dead in a nearby river."" All the three friends were shaken. Then the man continued ""It was said that Ikbaal sir killed the entire family of the kid when he realized that his life was ruined because of this case."". Jatin said ""Wtf !"". Sujon said ""But we have studied there, how come we didn't know about this?"". The man said ""You guys must be small at that time. Ask your parents, They will surely remember this. The whole city knows this case."". Jatin said ""I remember that something was wrong at that time. Like sir blamed a lot of kids During that time, even me, but then he left school."" Yogesh said ""Yes! He used to behave weirdly the last time I was here."". The man said, ""So this is his story !""",1,1735908264.0,u_ApplicationWide9297,0,1.0,False

Kidney stones are a common urological condition that can cause significant pain and discomfort. At **Ace Hospital**, Pune‚Äôs premier urology specialty hospital, we encounter numerous patients seeking relief and advice on managing this condition effectively. One critical aspect of managing kidney stones is understanding dietary restrictions, particularly why certain foods like cucumber, spinach, tomatoes, and beverages like coffee should be avoided.

In this blog, we‚Äôll break down the reasons behind these dietary restrictions and provide insights into how dietary choices can aid in the prevention and management of kidney stones.

**Understanding Kidney Stones**

Kidney stones are hard deposits made of minerals and salts that form inside your kidneys. These stones vary in size and composition, with the most common types being:

1. **Calcium Oxalate Stones** ‚Äì Formed due to high levels of calcium and oxalate in urine.
2. **Uric Acid Stones** ‚Äì Linked to high protein intake and acidic urine.
3. **Struvite Stones** ‚Äì Often associated with urinary tract infections.
4. **Cystine Stones** ‚Äì Rare and caused by genetic disorders.

Managing kidney stones largely depends on their size, type, and the individual‚Äôs dietary and lifestyle habits.

**The Role of Diet in Kidney Stone Management**

Diet plays a crucial role in either exacerbating or alleviating kidney stones. Foods high in certain substances, such as **oxalates**, **calcium**, **purines**, and **sodium**, can contribute to the formation of kidney stones. Avoiding or limiting these foods can prevent the condition from worsening and reduce the risk of recurrence.

**Why Avoid Cucumber, Spinach, Tomatoes, and Coffee?**

**1. Cucumber**

Although cucumbers are often considered hydrating and healthy, they are high in **oxalates**, which can bind with calcium in the urine to form kidney stones. For individuals prone to **calcium oxalate stones**, consuming large quantities of cucumber can increase the risk.

**Alternative:**

Replace cucumber with low-oxalate vegetables like zucchini or bell peppers in your diet.

**2. Spinach**

Spinach is a nutrient-rich vegetable, but it‚Äôs also one of the highest sources of oxalates. Even small servings of spinach can significantly increase oxalate levels in the urine, contributing to calcium oxalate stone formation.

**Did You Know?**

One cup of cooked spinach contains approximately **755 mg of oxalates**, making it a high-risk food for those with kidney stones.

**Alternative:**

Opt for low-oxalate greens such as kale, bok choy, or romaine lettuce.

**3. Tomatoes**

Tomatoes contain **oxalates**, but the concern arises particularly with their seeds, which are rich in calcium and oxalate content. When consumed in large quantities, they can increase the likelihood of stone formation.

**Pro Tip:**

If you love tomatoes, you can consume them in moderation by removing the seeds. However, always consult a healthcare provider.

**Alternative:**

Cooked pumpkin or squash are excellent substitutes for tomatoes in recipes.

**4. Coffee**

Coffee is a beloved beverage, but it poses a risk for kidney stone sufferers due to its high levels of **caffeine**. Caffeine increases calcium excretion in the urine, which can contribute to kidney stone formation. Additionally, coffee is a **diuretic**, which may lead to dehydration ‚Äì a significant risk factor for kidney stones.

**Alternative:**

Consider switching to herbal teas like chamomile or mint, which are gentler on the kidneys.

**Additional Dietary Tips for Kidney Stone Prevention**

**Stay Hydrated**

Water is your best friend when managing kidney stones. Aim for at least **2-3 liters of water per day** to dilute your urine and prevent stone formation.

**Limit Salt Intake**

A high-sodium diet increases calcium levels in the urine, contributing to stone formation. Avoid processed foods and reduce added salt in meals.

**Balance Calcium Intake**

Contrary to popular belief, calcium in food does not directly cause stones. In fact, low calcium levels can lead to oxalate absorption in the gut, increasing stone risk. Include moderate amounts of calcium-rich foods like dairy products.

**Avoid High-Purine Foods**

For uric acid stones, limit foods like red meat, organ meats, and seafood, as they increase uric acid levels in the body.

**How Ace Hospital Can Help**

At **Ace Hospital**, Pune, we offer comprehensive diagnostic and treatment services for kidney stones, including:



* Advanced imaging technologies for accurate diagnosis.
* **Minimally invasive surgical options** like laser lithotripsy and ureteroscopy.
* Personalized dietary counseling to prevent stone recurrence.



Our expert team, led by renowned urologists like **Dr. Suresh Patankar**, ensures patient-centric care with the latest advancements in urology.

**FAQs**

**1. Can I eat small amounts of these foods?**

Yes, but moderation is key. Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

**2. What are some low-oxalate fruits and vegetables?**

Fruits like bananas, melons, and apples, and vegetables like cabbage, cauliflower, and green peas are good options.

**3. Can drinking more water dissolve kidney stones?**

While water can help prevent stone growth, it may not dissolve existing stones. Consult a urologist for appropriate treatment options.

**Conclusion**

Kidney stones can be managed effectively with the right dietary choices and medical guidance. By avoiding high-risk foods like cucumber, spinach, tomatoes, and coffee, and incorporating kidney-friendly alternatives, you can reduce the risk of stone formation and recurrence.

 i can't shake this feeling of being completely unanchored from everything. yes i recognize none of this is deep and most of us have experienced this at 14 and moved on but it hit me again 

this sensation that all our human constructs, from our economic systems to our social hierarchies to our very ways of organizing knowledge, are just elaborate facades we've built to make sense of something fundamentally incomprehensible. i keep catching myself in these moments throughout the day where i'll be doing something entirely normal sending an email, buying coffee, having a meeting and suddenly it all feels absurd, like i'm participating in some strange performative ritual that we've collectively agreed to pretend makes sense.

the most unsettling part isn't the realization that everything is artificial it's the dawning understanding that there might not be anything ""real"" to get back to. we've built these layers upon layers of human interpretation and systematization, and abstraction and now i find myself wondering if we've lost the ability to experience existence in any other way.

it's left me feeling unmoored, searching for something real beneath all these layers of human invention. where do you go when you realize that even your most fundamental assumptions about reality are built on shifting sands? everything i thought was important suddenly feel absurd and paper-thin, i don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs important anymore",3,1735908175.0,redscarepod,2,0.72,False

So I‚Äôve been using an entry cheapo WPM ZD-10T grinder . All I know is it is a burr grinder with not a lot of retention because I use my own bellows (it‚Äôs actually a kitchen sink pump lol).

5 years down the road I somehow convinced myself to give away my Dedica. And replaced it with a Bambino.

To complete the package I also convinced myself to acquire the SD40s above, which is now arrived, but I‚Äôm now suffering buyers remorse because apparently the DF54 is the only thing worthwhile. 

Can someone actually talk some sense into me as I have a 5 day window to return the SD40s and pay another $60 for the DF54. Except I read that it tends to clog too easily. FWIW I have not actually done much cleaning or maintenance on my old grinder.

Will my $150 expense for the current SD40s be a fools errand, is there really so much more coffee from a 54mm flat burr?

1hslmdf,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalkTherapy/comments/1hslmdf/trauma_after_therapy_which_led_to_dissociative/,"Trauma after ""therapy"" which led to dissociative states, need advise ","Hello guys! I really need advise. I will try to make this story short, but I need to share some details so it might be hard.

I started therapy after realizing that I have very big problem with deeply connecting with other ppl. I couldn't have stable relationship, just fwb, hookups. I decided to go to the therapist. I read on the internet that CBT therapy is most science based and has highest rate of success. So I decided to give it a try. I found therapist which looked insanely highly qualified on paper, phd in psychology, 100 cbt and other therapies courses, 20 years of experience. I kinda felt like it's impossible for something to go wrong with that kind of person.

We disagreed on so many topics. I saw that she completely doesn't understand today's man problem. We were completely different, but I didn't mind, I like to see different point of views and kinda enjoyed it. Even tho I considered it stupid af sometimes. For example when we were talking about look, basically she was gas lightning me into thinking like everything is in my mind and all these statistics about for example women who like taller guys doesn't matter. But as I said, everything was fine, I was thinking that I am gonna learn something and that might lead to changing my perspective on looking at other ppl at some point. She was crazy about doing tests for everything, even when I didn't raise any concerns about anxiety, depressive states, functioning in everyday's tasks. First general anxiety disorder, later ADHD and something else later, but we will get there.

I stopped therapy because I flew to my friend to Asia. Therapist said that we can continue online whenever I want to do it. I had really good time with my friend in Asia. Everyday beach, good working routine, sometimes party. Life was good. But my friend left and I was left alone there, didn't want to go back to Europe yet because it was a middle of the winter there. I thought it's a really good idea to spend some time alone and see how it is. For the first time in my life I had not a single good friend around me, no one to talk to. I also thought it's a great idea to continue therapy online. So I did. She said that we NEED TO make ADHD tests, even tho I didn't consider it too important, since I didn't have problems with work, I didn't feel like I need any medications, so why should we even do it? It just seemed pointless for me. I felt like she cares more about her curiosity than my mental health. But I was like whatever, I trust you, you are the boss, let's do it.

In the meantime my grandma went to hospital. I started to have a lot of negative thoughts. I was thinking a lot about life and death. I did examination of conscience. I felt a lot of shame for being so far away from my grandmother. I was thinking about never telling her about how I love her. I felt it's so stupid that I am there now, partying, sometimes doing drugs, hooking up with random girls etc. That feeling led me to cry. But after few hours I was fine. Like a week later I had first anxiety attack. I had coffee on the empty stomach and started to feel so weird, overstimulated, couldn't focus on anything. I got diarrhea, I did better after going to the toilet. Also you know what are sanitary standards in south east asia. It happened week later again. Again after drinking coffee on empty stomach and eating in the same restaurant. I was 100% sure I just ate something bad and got food poisoning. I told about it to my therapist. And she was like: I think you had panic attacks. And I told her to chill, I am sure I just ate something bad. And she was like yeah yeah sure. That was the first red flag for me, why would she try to persuade me into mental problems instead of just giving me simple support? Ofc I understand it might be important to name things like that if it gets worse and I need support, but at this point I just needed a simple words of support and that would probably be fine. After these experiences I told her that I am feeling very insecure, I am alone here, my grandma is in hospital, I feel like I should visit her. It was tough, but stable. She told me to not care that much, that I will be back in 2-3 months when it's gonna be warmer, I should enjoy life. And I agreed with her, decided to extend my stay for another 2 months. After we finished ADHD tests which came out positive in her opinions, she said that she has to check one more thing but won't tell me what. We need to make one more test. I was kinda tired of it but was like whatever, let's get over it and let's finally start therapy, it's been like 4 months and all we did was arguing about some bullshit topics and making tests which I didn't even feel like we need to do.

So she started to ask me questions. By the questions I got I was sure we are testing depression. She finished the test and she was like: Congrats, it's negative! Do you know what you were tested for? - depression - No! I was doing borderline test, but don't worry it's negative, I had to check it because borderline and ADHD are very similar. And then I was like wtf is going on. We all know BPD stigma. And I just knew I am so different than all these BPD traits. Also she said I have ADHD and it's similar to BPD, and then I was like WTF, so what is this ADHD, before she told me it's just being a little bit more impulsive than others and I shouldn't worry. Now she tells me that it's similar to BPD? Like wtf lady. And I was left completely alone with all these things, 15k km from my hometown and my friends. I started to google ADHD like crazy. I started to think that these 2 panics attacks are because of some underlying mental health issue and they can happen any time because of that. I started to live in huge fear. Fear of losing control, fear of losing my mind. I started to have anxiety attacks in public places. Basically my life went to hell. That's when I had my first dissociative state in my life. I couldn't name it yet, but I am pretty sure it was that. I told my therapist about my very bad mental state and she was just like: - you just need to chill, it's not that bad, just meditate a little and everything gonna be fine. I was like wtf lady, I traveled to like 30 countries in my life, I made like a 50+ flights in my life, and now I cannot go out from my apartment because I am so afraid, it's serious stuff, meditation made me feel even worse actually.

I came back to my hometown. I was a mental wreck. I started to believe that she is my only solution to my problems. I started to be hella depended from her. I started to isolate myself from my friend. My anxiety was so bad I couldn't sleep, I couldn't even think clearly. I was directing her where I think is an issue, that she made it by doing these tests when I was in the lowest point of my life, which I told her about her. But she was gas lightning me into thinking that problem is deeper. So I had this anxiety because I was afraid about my mental health, but at the same time she was pushing me into thinking about my grandmother etc, which on top of my problems made me depresssed as hell. I was thinking that I am the worst person alive and my body and mind gives me all these signs. At this point I didn't even think that I am actually just afraid of her. I started to have dissociative states on regular basis, mostly after therapy sessions. I went to her for like a 4 more months, I told her many times about my concerns. And everytime she was just like: you need to chill, meditate, trust me it's normal it gets worse on the beginning of therapy. At some point my anxiety was so bad that I started to take benzo just to fall asleep. I didn't feel like I need any medication before, and now I felt like I can't stand reality at all. Dissociative states were getting worse and worse, I started to question reality everyday. At some point I went to psychiatrist and told him about all my concerns, he said that changing therapist sounds like a right idea.

I am with new therapist for 3 months, he is psychodynamic guy. Very cool, very intelligent person. He said that he see disorders, because I shouldn't react that bad in this situation. He said that I might be in spectrum of Narcissistic Personality Disorder. My father was abusive alcoholic, my mom also had tough character and was solo raising 3 kids. I was the youngest one, and I was kinda left alone. I feel like I had to create that egoistic persona to basically survive these tough times, that's what also science says about NPD. I don't disagree with this diagnosis, I see reasons behind it. With BPD concerns it was huge WTF for me, because I just know that I am completely opposite person and just couldn't figure it out why would she do that test to me. I also need to tell this straight away, I was never manipulative, aggressive, abusive to anyone. I could be mean and selfish sometimes, but not that much to destroy relationships with my friends etc. But at the same time I couldn't very deeply connect in friendships and relationships and needed a lot of validation from other ppl, I really needed to feel accepted. That's why I created this persona which is very successful and have very strong opinions about everything in the world, ""I always know better"" type of guy. Basically I was working very hard in my life to be completely independent from anything and anyone, and when it came true, I just felt empty inside. Probably that's why when I heard that somebody is testing me for disorders like BPD, especially in my most vulnerable point, it just couldn't get out of my head. I felt judged, I felt attacked. Imo therapist should be more careful with making tests like that when she suspects any kind of disorder. I also felt tricked into making this test, I would take it much more easily if she would tell me what she wants to test. Especially doing it online feels stupid af, especially when I said that I am not in the best shape at the moment. But honestly I don't have that much problem about just that test. My biggest issue with the therapist is making me so dependent from her for such a long time when I was doing just worse and worse. She should just tell me that she have no clue what is going on with me and just let me go, so I could look for help anywhere else. When I confronted her about it, that I think she made huge mistakes she looked terrified, first thing she said was that all her actions were legal. She was more afraid about her ass than my mental health.

After changing therapist I am doing much better. The problem is I think I might have huge PTSD after this long time of dissociative states. At some point my nervous system was so destroyed I was jumping out of my chair when I heard some random noise behind my window. My dissociative states stopped when I changed therapist, it was around 2-3 months ago. But I still question reality, I feel kinda disconnected. It's more about intrusive thoughts than a real state of my mind. I can't sleep well. I have a lot of nightmares, I can sleep max 4-5 hours per day which was never a case for me. I told about this me new therapist but he is much more focused about my personality disorder, which is fine. He is hella smart guy and maybe that's his way to get me out of those stupid thoughts. But idk, what do you guys think? It's hella stupid to even call it PTSD, because nothing really happened, just got a bit crazy about mental illnesses and my ego was hurt. But at the same time it kinda looks like PTSD to me. Idk if I should look for some EMDR therapy maybe, how to stop all these stupid intrusive thoughts that question reality everyday? Or you think I will just get better with time? What do you think, how can I come back to my normal state of mind? The only way when I can get these stupid thoughts out of my head is when I am really focused on something, like playing video games or whatever. But that's the problem. I was insanely social guy, I wanted to spend every minute of my day with other ppl, I was living a moment. Now I need to discconect from reality to not think about all these things.

Sorry for the long post, it's hella weird problem, I know, but I need an advice. Wish you all the best beautiful ppl!",1,1735908107.0,TalkTherapy,1,0.6,False

How strange to think that we're all just arrangements of matter set in motion by that primordial moment, each atom in my body once forged in the heart of ancient stars, and none of it really matters or means anything. not my pain, joy, experiences, the internet, not my daily job or struggles or my desire for more money to exist. 

with everything meaningless, it just made me wonder what i should do now? i don‚Äôt know what to make of it. 
i myself, like the atoms that form my body exist just to exist. unlike my atoms, i have consciousness, which makes existing as is to exist a bit difficult. 

i feel as if i‚Äôve been thrown in the air and i‚Äôm looking for something solid to grasp on to. so much of what we spend our time in is meaningless. i thought about studying physics and chemistry on my own, to understand the world.

this sensation that all our human constructs, from our economic systems to our social hierarchies to our very ways of organizing knowledge, are just elaborate facades we've built to make sense of something fundamentally incomprehensible. i keep catching myself in these moments throughout the day where i'll be doing something entirely normal sending an email, buying coffee, having a meeting and suddenly it all feels absurd, like i'm participating in some strange performative ritual that we've collectively agreed to pretend makes sense.

the most unsettling part isn't the realization that everything is artificial it's the dawning understanding that there might not be anything ""real"" to get back to. we've built these layers upon layers of human interpretation and systematization, and abstraction and now i find myself wondering if we've lost the ability to experience existence in any other way.

it's left me feeling unmoored, searching for something real beneath all these layers of human invention. where do you go when you realize that even your most fundamental assumptions about reality are built on shifting sands? everything i thought was important suddenly feel absurd and paper-thin, i don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs important anymore",7,1735908105.0,rs_x,4,0.89,False

1hsllrs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1hsllrs/weigh_issues_7m/,Weigh issues (7M) ,"My son (7M) has been staying with my family for the past week while they‚Äôre holidaying nearby. He has absolutely loved spending time with his cousins (8M and 6M). The boys, being so close in age, have always been similar in size and height. However, since he last saw them in June last year, my boy has grown almost 9cm taller than his older cousin. He has also gained some weight and now looks a bit 'chunky' compared to his petite cousins.

Tonight, after their showers, I was helping my son get ready for bed. I kissed his beautiful golden skin‚Äîhe‚Äôs gotten an incredible tan from playing outdoors. Suddenly, he said, ""Mama, why am I so fat? I need to lose weight."" I was absolutely heartbroken. I had to hold back tears as I asked him why he felt that way. He told me that a bully at school has been calling him fat, and he‚Äôs also noticed that he‚Äôs bigger than his cousins.

For context, both my husband and I have struggled with body image and weight issues. We‚Äôre on the higher end of the healthy BMI scale and are always working together to make healthier choices. However, we NEVER talk negatively about our weight, appearance or label food good or bad in front of our kids. I‚Äôll admit, I didn‚Äôt respond as well as I would have liked in the moment because I was so caught off guard by his comment.

Mr 7 stopped regular swimming lessons a while ago, and due to my work schedule, we‚Äôve been driving to school more often rather than riding. That said, he‚Äôs still quite active‚Äîplaying soccer daily at school, riding to school two days a week, playing tennis once a week, and recently taking up Muay Thai. Despite this decent activity level, I‚Äôve noticed some changes in his diet. Over the past few months, I‚Äôve allowed him to have a regular treat of a chocolate frappe (while I grab a coffee), and his lunchbox habits have shifted. His portions have grown for both snacks and lunches, with new requests for items like chips and noodles....Snacks he hasn‚Äôt typically eaten in the past.

1hslhzz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Woodworking_DIY/comments/1hslhzz/tips_for_fixing_a_teak_coffee_table/,Tips for fixing a teak coffee table,"Hi gang!

Apologies for my complete lack of knowledge about woodworking, but here goes. I got this Norwegian made teak coffee table a while back. I love it, but I don't dig the finish. I guess it's a lacquered / varnished finish, while I would prefer it to be more matte. There is also a big contrast between the top plate of the table, and the extension pieces. (guessing the top is sun bleached).

How would you approach this project? I'm guessing I need some kind of chemical to remove the old varnish, and then sand it down? I'm a little worried about that part, because I know a lot of Norwegian teak tables aren't hard wood, but a thin veneer of teak. There are some deeper knocks in the table that i figure i'll just have to live with, but hoping they might be less noticeable after treating it.

TLDR - I want my scuffed and shiny teak table to be more matte and pretty. How to approach?

Thanks in advance!

1hslhzi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Woodworking_DIY/comments/1hslhzi/tips_for_fixing_a_teak_coffee_table/,Tips for fixing a teak coffee table,"Hi gang!

Apologies for my complete lack of knowledge about woodworking, but here goes. I got this Norwegian made teak coffee table a while back. I love it, but I don't dig the finish. I guess it's a lacquered / varnished finish, while I would prefer it to be more matte. There is also a big contrast between the top plate of the table, and the extension pieces. (guessing the top is sun bleached).

How would you approach this project? I'm guessing I need some kind of chemical to remove the old varnish, and then sand it down? I'm a little worried about that part, because I know a lot of Norwegian teak tables aren't hard wood, but a thin veneer of teak. There are some deeper knocks in the table that i figure i'll just have to live with, but hoping they might be less noticeable after treating it.

TLDR - I want my scuffed and shiny teak table to be more matte and pretty. How to approach?

It's a new year, so I thought maybe I should finally put my plan on being more fit and losing some pounds into fruition. However, I'm medicated, and I'm unsure if it's actually possible to lose these excess pounds, and I have a lot of em...

  
To make a long story short, two months ago I had to switch my medication from paliperidone to risperidone, which is an older generation antipsychotic which I was taking in the early years of my illness. I'm also taking quetiapine each evening, some prozac in the morning and amisulpride twice a day. I also have some hydroxyzinum that I take on an ad hoc basis.

  
So, I wanted to ask those who are on similar types of meds, how did you lose your weight? I'm planning to cut on coffee with sugar and milk, and also will try to introduce some exercise. But, it's possible that I won't lose anything at all since I've heard stories of people with schizophrenia having struggles with losing weight on their medication. I've heard keto is pretty good, but to me that diet is too extreme and really not longterm.

  
Would appreciate any insights on this.

My cousin and his wife came to stay with me one weekend. We went out, had dinner got a bit drunk. 

I am living in a one bedroom apartment, so I gave them my bedroom whilst I slept on the couch. I went in to give them coffee in bed in the morning (after knocking) and it was clear that they were up to something and had stopped suddenly when I came in. I excused myself and left the drinks on the table. 

Jokingly said, ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt have sex in my bedroom ha ha‚Äù and then left. 5 mins later I heard them go into my bathroom together, and then proceeded to have very loud sex. It was like 11am. I did not need to hear this and I was getting very sickened by being able to hear my cousin fuck his wife. So I put my headphones in and waited for it to stop. Half an hour later, they come into the kitchen and casually have brunch with me (that I had prepared). 

They could see that I was upset, but they just laughed it off and said that it‚Äôs because they were horny and they don‚Äôt get to have sex often as they have a small kid. No apology given. Made out like I was overreacting. Anyway the day went on, and I kind of forgot about it as we had stuff planned to do for the day. 

After we got back home and they had left, I was cleaning up and happened to find the used condom in my bathroom bin. I am absolutely fuming. I feel sick that that my cousin would do this. I‚Äôve had to deal with the used condom and I feel sick to my stomach. I never want to speak to them again. Am I overreacting here? Should I try and speak to them about this?

All Stars is always going to have a special place in my heart. Seeing All stars just makes me think of Disney magic. I have been pixie dusted at both . I might share that in a different post or make an edit. 

I go on a budget. I look at the difference in costs between other hotels and I would rather spend that difference other ways to enhance my vacation, like special events, eating where I want, let my son build a lightsaber, merch, dessert party. 

The deluxe resorts I‚Äôve walked around (poly/contemp) are gorgeous and I‚Äôd love to stay there one day, but unless I went through that Dave‚Äôs rental thing or was pixie dusted, I‚Äôll realistically probably never stay there. I am jealous some are close enough to walk to certain parks. That would be so awesome.

But All stars is in the Disney bubble. It has clean rooms with a soft bed. I can wake up and turn on the tv to see the park hours and hear the music which is my guilty pleasure. It‚Äôs got clean bathrooms where I can cleanse myself after coming back a sweaty hot mess. I do spend majority of my time in the parks. It‚Äôs got a pool to cool me down and a food court where I can go get my coffee or soda. The buses are plentiful in my experiences. 

All stars is never a bad option in my opinion. I would rather stay there than stay in a big house off site.

I (23F) became friends with one of my coworkers (31M) last year and I‚Äôve given him an incredible amount of leeway with his behavior. 

Some facts about him: He makes inappropriate, sexual jokes constantly. He doesn‚Äôt take accountability for his actions. He‚Äôs struggled with substance abuse. He kissed my (then) girlfriend and never apologized for it until I brought it up. He likes to poke, both literally and figuratively, me and others out of ‚Äúgood fun‚Äù when in reality it‚Äôs quite frankly just him being childish and annoying. He made me extremely uncomfortable when we were out one night just the two of us‚Ä¶ he grabbed my legs and pushed them open and put his head in between my legs. Again, he thought he was being funny, so in his mind it was harmless. 

After that last incident I ended our friendship. He wasn‚Äôt a good influence, he didn‚Äôt make me feel good, and considering everything else he‚Äôd done I knew it was the right decision. He proceeded to apologize by writing me a letter and buying me coffee at work and a bottle of champagne for my birthday. I finally had to tell him harshly that I wanted nothing to do with him. No texts, no in person talks, nothing.

Flash forward about 6 months ago I moved states. He started texting me again and I let him back in. We had conversations again about everything that happened. He invited me back home to Australia with him for the holiday, and I went. At first, I was very hesitant. I didn‚Äôt trust him, and for good reason. But I thought to myself, okay, I‚Äôve got better boundaries now, he‚Äôs apologized a million times, things will be fine.

Things weren‚Äôt fine. One of the last nights we went out he got very drunk and was being incredibly touchy with me. He tried having a heart to heart saying how sad he was when we weren‚Äôt friends, blah blah blah. He had his arm around me and was kissing my shoulder, weird, uncomfortable. We got up to play pool and he proceeds to slap my ass. I was so shocked I didn‚Äôt know what to say. I feel disgusted. He did it three more times that night even after I told him not to. We went to a gay club after and he was being extremely touchy, again. He‚Äôd come up behind me and wrap his arms around me, I‚Äôd push him off every time, he‚Äôd still come back. I was talking to these two girls and he came over and tried to unzip my top. He slapped one of the girls on the ass. He got kicked out of the women‚Äôs restroom. We got in the uber and he would not stop putting his hands on me. 

We had a conversation about all this the following day and he apologized, but the apology means nothing when I‚Äôve heard it countless times for other things. He claims he doesn‚Äôt remember anything from the night. He also claims he‚Äôs like that with all of his friends, even his male friends, and that he didn‚Äôt intend to make me feel uncomfortable and that it wasn‚Äôt sexual. He shed a couple tears in the car and told me he was sorry and that he loved me. It was uncomfortable. 

I‚Äôm flying back to the states tomorrow. I changed my seats so I‚Äôm not sitting by him on any of the flights. I bought a hotel room for myself when we land but I haven‚Äôt told him. I was supposed to stay with him at his house and he‚Äôd bring me to the airport the following day so I could catch my flight back to my respective state. 

I‚Äôve been staying at his parents house in Australia and it‚Äôs been so difficult to act like everything is normal. He‚Äôs acting like nothing ever happened. He‚Äôs gifting me things, talking about the future, talking about coming to visit me. I‚Äôm just trying to make it through the next 24 hours of travel until I‚Äôm home and away from him. I don‚Äôt feel comfortable telling him I got a hotel because I don‚Äôt know how he‚Äôll react, so I‚Äôm waiting until we land back in the states. 

Any and all advice is appreciated‚Ä¶ What‚Äôs the safest way to approach this going forward until I am home and a thousand miles away from him? Is it worth telling him off? Do I just act like everything is normal and wait until I‚Äôm home to say something?",1,1735907076.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

The Breville Barista Express is a prized possession for any coffee enthusiast, delivering barista-quality espresso at home.  But its sophisticated mechanics and delicate components mean that transporting or storing it requires more than just tossing it in a box.  This guide focuses on creating a robust and protective crate for your Breville Barista Express, ensuring safe delivery whether you're moving house or shipping it to a friend. We'll cover everything from preparing the machine to double-boxing for ultimate protection.

## Understanding Your Breville Barista Express: A Closer Look

Before we delve into the crating process, let's understand the machine's vulnerabilities.  The Breville Barista Express, measuring 12.5 inches wide, 13.8 inches deep, and 15.9 inches high, houses several delicate components:

* **Integrated Conical Burr Grinder:** This precision grinder is susceptible to damage from impact.
* **Stainless Steel Portafilter:** While durable, the portafilter can be scratched or dented if not properly protected.
* **Thermocoil Heating System:**  This system contains water, posing a risk of leakage and potential damage from freezing during transport.
* **Electronic Components:** The machine‚Äôs electronics are sensitive to shocks and vibrations.


## Identifying Potential Shipping Hazards: Risks to Avoid

Shipping your Breville Barista Express carries inherent risks.  Understanding these risks is the first step to mitigating them:

* **Impact Damage:**  Rough handling during transit can lead to dents, cracks, and internal damage to the grinder or heating system.
* **Water Damage:**  Failure to drain the boiler adequately can result in water leaks, damaging internal components and potentially causing rust.
* **Electrical Component Failure:**  Vibrations and shocks during transit can damage sensitive electronic components, rendering your machine unusable.
* **Accessory Damage:**  Loose portafilters, tamper, and other accessories can be damaged or lost during transit if not properly secured.


## Essential Steps for Safe Breville Barista Express Transport

Proper preparation is key to a successful move or shipment.  Here's a detailed step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Preparing the Machine for Transport

1. **Drain the Boiler:** Completely drain the boiler of any water.  Consult your Breville Barista Express manual for specific instructions on how to do this. This prevents water leaks and potential freezing damage.
2. **Remove and Secure Accessories:**  Carefully remove the portafilter, tamper, and any other removable accessories. Wrap each individually in bubble wrap and place them in a separate, smaller box inside the main crate.
3. **Clean the Machine:**  Wipe down the exterior of the machine to remove any coffee residue or spills that could attract pests during transit.


### Step 2: Protecting the Breville Barista Express with Bubble Wrap

1. **First Layer of Bubble Wrap:**  Wrap the machine generously in bubble wrap, ensuring the bubble side faces outwards.  Use ample bubble wrap to provide a cushion against impacts.
2. **Second Layer of Bubble Wrap:**  For added protection, apply a second layer of bubble wrap, securing both layers with packing tape.  Pay extra attention to corners and edges, reinforcing these vulnerable areas.


### Step 3: Creating a Protective Liner and Adding Packing Peanuts

1. **Use a Liner:** Place the bubble-wrapped espresso machine inside a sturdy liner, such as a large plastic bag or a thick cardboard box. This provides an extra layer of protection and keeps packing peanuts from directly touching the machine.
2. **Fill with Packing Peanuts:**  Completely fill the box with packing peanuts, ensuring the machine is firmly supported and cannot shift during transit.  Avoid using newspaper or other materials that could tear or smudge the machine.


### Step 4: Securing the Box and Adding Fragile Labels

1. **Secure the Power Cord:**  Securely wrap the power cord and any other cables to prevent them from getting tangled or damaged. Consider taping them to the outside of the liner.
2. **Seal the Box:**  Use heavy-duty packing tape to securely seal the box, reinforcing all seams and edges.
3. **Apply Fragile Labels:**  Affix several ‚ÄúFragile‚Äù and ‚ÄúHandle with Care‚Äù labels to all sides of the box to alert handlers to its delicate contents.


### Step 5: Double Boxing for Maximum Protection (Highly Recommended)

For long-distance moves or shipments, double boxing offers unparalleled protection.

1. **Outer Box:** Place the first box securely inside a larger, sturdier cardboard box.
2. **Fill with Packing Peanuts:**  Again, fill all the empty space in the outer box with packing peanuts, ensuring the inner box is completely immobilized.
3. **Seal the Outer Box:** Securely seal the outer box with heavy-duty packing tape.


##  Choosing the Right Shipping Crate: Material and Size Considerations

The size of your crate should be slightly larger than your double-boxed Breville Barista Express, allowing for ample space for packing peanuts.  Use high-quality, sturdy cardboard boxes designed for shipping.  Avoid using flimsy or recycled boxes.


##  Addressing Common Concerns and Misconceptions

**Myth:**  Using excessive packing peanuts is wasteful.

**Reality:**  Using enough packing peanuts to fully immobilize the machine is crucial for preventing damage during transit.  Under-packing is far more wasteful, as it increases the risk of damage and potential replacement costs.

**Myth:**  Insurance is unnecessary for a smaller item.

**Reality:**  Shipping insurance is a wise investment, providing financial protection in case of loss or damage during transit.


## Conclusion: Protecting Your Investment

I never really figured out how much caffeine that is, but caffeine really doesn't affect me anymore  :)

I've been on Huel for a few weeks and this morning,  I added one teaspoon of instant coffee to the supposedly already caffeinated caramel  flavor. 

It was pretty good.

I'm not sure how it would work with my other choices:
Chocolate 
Banana 
Salted caramel

While I'm on this topic, i'm probably going to double up on banana next order I have yet to try choc or salted caramel yet. ",3,1735906800.0,Huel,4,1.0,False

So a Starbucks that‚Äôs more family geared with winter treats for the kids. 

The idea would be to have the equipment stored elsewhere during the hot season and to try and get the same staff to work for you while you lease the building from the independent owner. ",2,1735906398.0,Business_Ideas,1,1.0,False

1hsl4lf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diverticulitis/comments/1hsl4lf/recurring_nightmare_and_long_ass_recovery/,Recurring nightmare and long ass recovery! ,"Diagnosed with Diverticulitis in June. Ended up in hospital for 7 days on a drip then surgery to drain an abscess due to perforation.

Since then, had numerous small flares, not needing ER. Didn't follow much of a strict diet, but do drink alot of alcohol (weekend binger) and coffee.

Anyways, I recently went for a second opinion with a surgeon to see why I'm still consistently getting small flares. Do CT scan, no new perforations, but he did say I was seriously inflamed and have serious diverticulitis. He said I should operate asap. I declined because I felt that was drastic.

No jokes, the following week I end up in ER with a hardcore flare, sweating, nausea, dizzy you know the story.

That was 11 December and since then, I've been on antibiotics and still not right. Constant mild pain, fatigue and bad reactions to food and coffee. No fever though.

Has anyone else taken over a month to recover from a bad flare on antibiotics? 

This is insane, I'm seriously considering resection surgery.

Last question, has anyone learned to live with this without needing surgery. Avoiding future flares needing ER?

I've got family staying this weekend and the kids (early teens) are keen to see the loch. Can anyone share if Luss is a more picturesque spot to take visitors? My only memory of it from years ago is a crowded car park, but doubt that'll be an issue at this time of year. 

Hoping for scenic views, a decent cafe and ideally the chance for a bit of a stroll along the waterfront. Which would tick most boxes, Luss or Balmaha? Cheers!",3,1735906274.0,glasgow,8,1.0,False
