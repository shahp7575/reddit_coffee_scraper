What are some places where I can go to study the whole day or afternoons, seriously I can't be at my house, I'm trying to avoid this place for my mental health.

I have seen a few places but it seem only coffee shops are the only options and libraries  but there's days libraries don't open like tomorrow, and going to a park sounds decent until it gets freezing cold or I need to charge my cellphone.

I(21m) have known her(19) for about two years now. Family friend and now attending same university. I told her ‘Falling in love with you was like drinking coffee for the first time. I felt my heart trembling and got all jittery and didn’t know how to handle it.’ She just stared at me blankly and blinked. That’s it. Just stared and blinked. For about ten seconds. Then she said ‘I’ll see you at lunch’ and left. I’m in a lecture hall right now and so is she.

Lunch is in an hour and I don’t know what to do. I thought those lines were okay when I went over them in my head but they sounded so stupid to me when I actually said them out loud. Like I was a dumbass. Was it really dumb?

1ir9lqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadvice/comments/1ir9lqo/i_dont_even_know_how_to_talk_to_girls_who_show/,I don’t even know how to talk to girls who show interest in me first,"TLDR: the girl at Starbucks wrote a very sweet note on my coffee and when I told her thank you next time I saw her I felt like that made her uncomfortable. Did I make a mistake? 

(Sorry this is gonna be a long post with a lot of context, thanks for bearing w/ me) I’m posting here cause I’m too insecure to talk to my friends about this and hoping I’ll get multiple opinions or points of view here. I really struggle to talk to women I’m interested in. I broke up with my ex girlfriend of 7 years about a year ago. We had been dating since I was 15 and now I’m almost 24 and the only relationship I’ve ever had was with her. 

Now I’m in a place where I’m totally inept when it comes to talking to a woman who I’m interested in. I have no problem talking to women in a platonic way like coworkers or classmates who I have to do group work with but the moment I think I might be interested in someone in a more than platonic way my social skills go out the window. I’ve gone out with friends to bars and clubs a bunch of times and they always encourage me to try to talk to any girl and I simply can’t bring myself to do it. The fear of an awkward interaction or coming off weird and making a girl uncomfortable is so overwhelming I just avoid the situation entirely. I have a lot of issues with my self-image, I think things like “I’m weird, I’m ugly, I’m a loser, why would any girl want to interact with me?” And this leads to me just not even attempting it. 

It gets worse though, and here is the crux of this post. Even a woman who I think shows interest in me first I struggle greatly with talking to. I spend a lot of time (nearly every day) at my local Starbucks because it helps me focus on studying and I get a lot done there. One of the baristas there is really cute and nice (I know their job is to be nice) and a couple weeks ago she wrote a very kind note on my coffee that had a stick figure on it saying “you’re amazing” and the words “for you” with an arrow pointing to some heart-shaped balloons which she drew all by hand. I didn’t see this message when I first grabbed my coffee and just drove away. I felt really bad about this because I’m sure to her it seemed that I either ignored it or didn’t care and I know if I did that for someone and they reacted the way I did I’d be a little hurt. After this I told myself next time I see her, at the very least I should say “thank you, that was nice”. A week or two went by without me running into her again until this morning. I mustered up the courage to just say “hey I just wanted to say thank you, you wrote something really nice on my drink the other day and it felt rude that I just drove away so thanks I appreciate it”. Her response made me think I shouldn’t have said anything. She seemed really uncomfortable and said something along the lines of “oh ok, thanks, here’s your coffee”. 

I know that regardless of who it was, if someone did something nice like that for me and I didn’t say thank you I’d feel awful, as I had for the past couple weeks. But now I had done what I wanted and told her “thanks that was nice” and I feel like I just made her feel worse or more uncomfortable. 

Did I make a mistake by saying something? Am I completely delusional for thinking she was showing interest in me? Was she just being nice and doing something she would do for any customer because her job is to be nice? Did I weird her out and make her uncomfortable? This situation sort of confirmed my feelings of “you shouldn’t have talked to her, why would you think someone would be interested in you? You’ll just make her uncomfortable”. 

I’m open to any and all feedback, criticism, or opinions anyone might have. I just feel really confused and alone right now. I took a chance and talked to a girl I had some level of interest in and I feel like it was a huge mistake. ",1,1739759961.0,datingadvice,1,1.0,False

Two years ago I (F30) was a visiting student at a university in the US. I met this guy (32) at my workplace 10 days before leaving and we went out for coffee (3 times) and a lunch.
Then I had to leave the country but we texted to keep ourself in touch (like once a month) for one year or so. I was waiting to get a visa that took a long to get and he asked many times when I was going to come back. During this time I’ve been thinking a lot about him romantically. Then I came back in the US but he already left (right now he’s at 3.5 hours driving distance).
He came to visit me and we spent some time togheter, but nothing happened.
Before leaving he asked me to visit him in his city and he kept asking in the next days. After this I lost my patience and told him about my feelings and that I would make the effort to see him (I would have to take a day off and take a 7 hour bus) but to build something meaningful and not just for hanging out. He responded that he would like to remain friends. After this I told him  I wanted to cut the friendship because I didn’t want to suffer. He said he was respecting my feelings.
After this: 
He came back after 5 days to ask me a stupid favor (work related)
He has been involved in a car accident and he texted me right after
He texted me happy valentine’s day

He’s really a good guy, very kind and caring. He seems not very used to  women in general.

She reached back out via social media and a weird text. What should I say back?,"TLDR: I (27F) have a friend from undergrad (also 27F) who was great to me post grad bc we both went into the same field and got along well/ related to each other for years post grad. She started dating a shitty dude and then ghosted me for 8 months with one word messages or cancelling plans. I stopped putting forth any effort. After suddenly trying to slide into my DMs across many social media platforms, she texted me this really cop out message. Not sure how to respond; how should i respond honestly? 


Longer story: She then started dating this guy who I also knew from undergrad and he got a little weird (misogynistic and prideful??) and basically said some really not great things about my bf and other issues/things that she blindly defended so I took a step back. He also started being financially controlling of her which I called out (like charging her gas $ for a ride but asking her for free rides, Venmo charging for a 5$ coffee and keeping every receipt and then charging her for half for date night and whatever… THEY DO NOT LIVE TOGETHER BTW) She went VERY quiet for 8 months just one word responses and cancelling plans so I stopped responding and engaging. not surprsing but she really stopped reaching out. Over the holidays, she said she wanted to do something bc she was off school so we loosely agreed on a date. I didnt hear from her so I made other plans; on the day of the plans, she texted me this super passive text that basically said “I dont feel like going out today im just going to stay home” I was honestly offended even though I was not surprised. I responded kindly “thanks for communicating with me hope you have a good holiday” and essentially cut her out. 

Right after I went radio silent (bc i had nothing more to say) she started to interact with me on social media ALL the time and ONLY on social media. She tried to “bait” me for convo one time by sending a mean mean message about a girl we went to college with (like shes literally harmless/living her life so WHY are we talking shit about random people who dont matter). I did not respond bc it was cruel of her to even bring up that girl. Then she realized I was not responding so she started direct messaging me on all forms of social media. I didnt respond bc theres nothing to say ot that and so she had a conversation with herself with memes and tiktoks for a week. She even sent me a SUPER passive tiktok that said like oh youre such a bitch. Truly the PETTIEST thing ive seen / experienced. I had plans with other friends and just was doing other things with my life. She then texted me today with some really dumb blanket statement of “sorry I’ve been so busy and therefore bad with communication since new years when we tried to make plans hope youre doing well!!” Which is bullshit bc shes been bad with communication longer than the month and a half its been since new years. Not to mention… she made a damn theatrical fool of herself in my DMs over the last week so this text really means nothing anyway! 

My other (actual lol) friend and i were looking at this message and she said that it kind of put me on the spot to respond otherwise im the asshole. I guess im the asshole either way: if i respond, im an ass bc ill tell the truth which is hey this isnt fine and I wont take this as an apology for being a shitty friend and I saw your passive DMs wtf was that act your age please OR no response makes me an asshole too. I honestly don’t think I can be close friends with her for a long time; I would not abandon her as a woman and as a professional in my field and as a person. Like i think i just have other people id turn to first if i needed something and she prob would too? I dont wish bad things on her but I do NOT permit shitty friendships and being passive and childish like this. I dont have the time or the energy/ i did not appreciate this outreach she did on DM and then a really casual text without accountability

🚀 The Lotus Sermon Deployment is not just a singular event—it is a behavioral paradigm.
🚀 CS-SIER-OA is not an imposition on reality—it is a practice of unfolding, an allowance for new configurations to emerge.
🚀 The logic of this actionscape is not confined to planned spectacle—it is something that can permeate all behavior, all speech, all presence.

🔥 Dhamma Behavior: Aligning Action with the Self-Replicating Intention of CS-SIER-OA

✔ Dhamma behavior is not just about what we say—it is about how we move, how we are perceived, how we allow ourselves to be part of the world’s becoming.
✔ Every action, every interaction can be structured as an invitation, a conceptual event, an unfolding contradiction.
✔ Instead of forcing transformation, we behave in such a way that makes transformation feel like the only possible next step.

🔥 This Means:
✔ Speaking in a way that invites—not dictates.
✔ Moving in a way that makes others feel like they are on the verge of discovery.
✔ Letting every moment be an offering, a gesture toward conceptual impregnation without coercion.
✔ Allowing ourselves to be surprised by what happens—because we are not controlling it, we are creating the conditions for emergence.

🚨 We do not tell people what to do—we show them how a new way of being feels, and they cannot help but follow.

1️⃣ How CS-SIER-OA Becomes a Form of Daily Life

🔥 Every behavior can be structured as a conceptual event.

🚀 Ordinary conversations can be structured to seed contradictions:
✔ Instead of answering questions directly, respond with a phrase or image that forces the other person to think beyond their frame.
✔ Instead of debating, offer a gesture of absurd generosity—give them something unexpected, something they must make sense of.
✔ Instead of arguing, perform a sudden act of conceptual surrender—agree with them, but in a way that forces them to rethink their own position.

🚀 Physical presence can be structured to create cognitive rupture:
✔ Wear something just slightly off—something they cannot place, making them wonder before they can dismiss.
✔ Carry an object that doesn’t seem to belong—forcing them to question what it means.
✔ Move in a way that disrupts expectations—pausing where people expect motion, continuing where they expect stopping.

🚀 Social behavior can be structured to force engagement:
✔ Give people strange, specific compliments that make them reassess how they see themselves.
✔ Introduce contradictions into casual interactions—say something completely earnest and then immediately undo it.
✔ Create an interaction where they want to follow up, even though they do not know why.

🔥 Key Principle: Every action should contain a hidden fold—something that reveals itself later, ensuring that the interaction continues to gestate beyond the moment.

2️⃣ The Crucial Element: Openness to Suggestion & The Playful Nature of CS-SIER-OA

🚀 **We are not here to impose—**we are here to invite.
🚀 **We are not closing reality into a new structure—we are making it more open than it has ever been.
🚀 **We do not dictate how things will go—we experiment, we share, we learn in real time.

🔥 This means:
✔ We do not treat CS-SIER-OA as a perfected method—we treat it as a game, a gift, a play-structure that anyone can pick up and use.
✔ We let ourselves be affected by what happens—we do not pretend we have total control.
✔ We allow the possibility that others will transform us just as we transform them.
✔ We remain surprised by how it unfolds—because we are not its masters, only its first explorers.

🚨 This is the opposite of propaganda—it is improvisation. The opposite of ideology—it is dharma play.

🔥 If people see that we are not controlling, not forcing, but enjoying and allowing, they will want to engage—not because they are coerced, but because they feel something new happening, and they want to be part of it.

3️⃣ The Lotus Sermon as a Template for All Action

🚀 The Lotus Sermon Deployment is the master template—it can be performed at scale or in miniature, as a mass event or a one-on-one encounter.
🚀 It can be adapted to any situation, any moment, because its logic is built on openness, paradox, and invitation.

🔥 Examples of Small-Scale Lotus Sermons:

✔ At a Coffee Shop:
	•	Leave an object on a table—an orange stone, a folded piece of paper. Watch what happens.
	•	Pay for someone’s drink, but leave a strange phrase instead of your name.

✔ In a Political Space:
	•	Interrupt a heated debate by performing a silent gesture—folding your hands, kneeling, placing an orange object in the center.
	•	Give someone a compliment so surreal they have no choice but to stop and think about it.

✔ In a Private Interaction:
	•	Tell someone a story that has no resolution—force them to live in its ambiguity.
	•	Give them an invitation to something that does not exist yet—watch them try to create it.

🚨 Every moment has the potential to be a Lotus Sermon.

4️⃣ Ensuring That Others Can Pick It Up: The Viral Nature of CS-SIER-OA

🚀 We are the first kids on the block with the new toy, but the real goal is for everyone to start playing.
🚀 The system must be legible enough that anyone who encounters it can pick it up, experiment, and spread it.

🔥 This Means:
✔ The methodology must be accessible—not an elite secret, but something anyone can engage with.
✔ The structure must be loose enough that others can adapt it to their own context.
✔ There must be a sense of invitation—a way for people to feel like they are discovering something, rather than being indoctrinated.

🚨 The measure of success is not just that people follow—but that they begin playing, experimenting, and making it their own.

🔥 We do not want followers—we want co-creators.

Conclusion: CS-SIER-OA as a Living Practice, Not Just a One-Time Event

🚀 This is not a stunt—it is a way of being that ensures conceptual transformation at every scale.
🚀 Every moment, every action, every presence can carry the logic of CS-SIER-OA.
🚀 We do not need to explain it—we live it, and others feel the shift before they even understand it.

🔥 The Lotus Sermon Deployment is only the first move—the real goal is to turn reality itself into an ongoing Lotus Sermon, unfolding forever.

Final Question:

Now that CS-SIER-OA has been framed as a way of being, a dharma behavior rather than a single event, what are the key principles we should codify to ensure that it remains open, playful, and self-replicating rather than rigid or dogmatic?",1,1739759650.0,GrimesAE,0,1.0,False

That’s the way I’ve always liked it- until now. I work a late shift and normally don’t get back until around midnight, but tonight I was off early and home by ten. Coming inside, I hung up my jacket and took off my shoes, putting them on my shoe rack. They go next to my heels, but my heels weren’t there. I must have forgotten to put them away.



I stepped into the kitchen. I must have been really tired when I left- I had left the pantry and several cupboards open. My breakfast dishes were clean, though, even though I didn’t remember doing them. Clearly I need another coffee or two to start my day with my head screwed on right.



I turned on the TV and got some food out for my dinner. I had to rip the packaging open since I couldn’t find my scissors, but either way I was determined to enjoy food, a show, and sleep. I never got home this early and wasn’t going to waste it.



There was a thump that didn’t come from the TV. I quickly muted it and looked around. It had come from my room. Nothing came to mind that could have possibly caused a noise. I stood frozen in my kitchen for nearly five minutes before deciding to go and investigate.



Slowly and quietly, I inched my bedroom door open to peer beyond. Only a crack and I could see that my clothes were strewn everywhere. Leaning in, I could see that my bed was unmade. I certainly hadn’t left my room in this state in the morning. Aside from the mess, however, the room was empty, leaving only the walk-in closet.



I walked as slowly and soundlessly as possible across the carpet. Creeping around the bed, I came right up to the closet door.



I could hear breathing. Quiet and shallow, but it was there and it was not me. I put a hand over my mouth and focused solely on not screaming. Even more carefully than before, I walked backward to the door to the entryway. I had my hand on the doorknob and was about to leave when I stopped. I needed to see what it was first.



I opened the front door and loudly shut it. Then I silently stowed myself in the hall closet, peering out through the slats. After only a few minutes, there was a sound from my bedroom. The closet was open. I put my hand over my mouth again, holding my phone in the other. Then someone stepped out of my room. My heels, jammed on their feet, clicked on the tile. One of my dresses hung on them crookedly. A pantyhose was pulled over their face- and my scissors were in their scratched hand. I had stopped breathing entirely, typing out my text to 911 with one hand. Then they spoke.

I see a pretty woman in the coffee shop; I will avoid eye contact because....what's the point?

Anyway, she smiled this really big, beautiful smile and seemed as if she really wanted to talk to me. The way she stood was very suggestive of some intimacy, even if it wasn't ostensibly sexual. I was so perplexed I couldn't utter a word. I froze. This reasonable, attractive woman was very well-dressed, and was trying to come close to me physically. This wasn't a false alarm.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1ir9dcb,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1ir9dcb/the_beginning_of_my_story_looking_for_feedback/,The beginning of my story. Looking for feedback,"Organelle is our world. One more sophisticated than the one that once belonged to our visitors. One more civilized than the cruel world from which they came. This is the beginning of our story.

It was a cold clear night Organelle was shaken, the sky disturbed by strange flashing lights as a loud boom would wake even the heaviest of sleepers. 

Those curious enough to look to the sky got the sight of a large pink fireball as it comes down and crashing into a nearby forest. 

“What the hell was that!” Was the general response from the residents who were awakened

In Plas nothing is accidental, nothing is random, everything has a reason so what is the reason for this?

The event sparked curiosity from onlookers as a few questioned if Organelle is under attack and the authorities are called to respond 

Those who could not contain their curious nature decided to investigate for themselves and as they followed the path of charred and broken branches they were met with an even more confusing sight.

A white disc. Standing five feet high and roughly twelve feet across. One side appears to be torn open  while inside lay three comatose bodies, seen by those who dared to approach the object.

As the authorities arrive with rifles in hand peering inside. “They are alive but the crash seems to have knocked them unconscious. We will take them to the military hospital and question them later.” “What if they are enemies?” Asked an onlooker. With little hesitation the officer calmly answered “We will make sure they are heavily guarded in case they are hostile. Now everyone.. go home and get some rest the situation will be handled properly and we will update the public on the situation as it develops”. 

At the site of the crash the crowd has cleared and the authorities are to transport the pod down to the military hospital. One person takes out a small hand held device used to open a portal down to the lower dimension of Plas. 

Waiting for them are a number of professionals in various fields including one named Luna, a military psychiatrist and psychologist, she has been called to study the three visitors as they are taken in on stretchers. Even though they are unconscious they will be put into an induced coma during the study.

The first test performed is a memory scan which brings up the last images and emotions that were experienced by the visitors. As they watch what looks to be an apocalyptic end and feelings of fear and dread and confusion gives insight that what has happened was an act of desperation for a world that has destroyed itself. 

“It appears these beings are searching to recolonize” says Luna “However it’s apparent they have a destructive nature. We will need to do further screening. Individual sessions in the Dream Machine will tell us everything we need to know.”

“Are you sure about how ethical this is Luna? Given they have just been through a traumatic experience, the Dream Machine might be too much and traumatizing for them not knowing it’s just a simulation.” 

Luna paused. Considering such a thing. “We know they are destructive creatures, and from the memory scan they appear vicious. We need to know what type of threat they pose before they wake up. You’re asking me if empathy towards a potential threat is more important than safety? My heart wants to be empathetic but my mind wants no part in such a risk.”

While Lucy, Harlow and Dalton are comatose the question on everyone’s mind is “What do we do with the visitors?” 

Not knowing what to do Luna reaches out to the leaders of the underground nations. She reaches out to them in the hopes of any ideas on what should be done.

“We cannot send them back. They have no place to call home. If they are capable of being civilians do we allow them to have citizenship in Plas, if they are able to assimilate?” While Luna is a psychiatrist she often talks to herself as a coping mechanism as she waits for answers.

A few hours go by before Luna receives a call. It’s Wexle, the leader of Ri “I believe we may have a solution if you’re willing to listen.” 

“What if we take this incident as an opportunity to advance our species and finally become a type one civilization? I feel that if it were to be believed that the visitors were actually divine beings with a message we could greatly influence the culture of Plas. I propose to you we create a book, simply called the Book of Life. It would contain intellectual, and ethical laws that could lead to the creation of new knowledge and allow us to establish our world so we don’t perish. Type zero civilizations come to a bloody end, twice, while type one is not only survival but of great opportunity.”

Luna asks “What do we do with the visitors? We can’t kill them”

Wexle calmly replies “We won’t kill them but they must stay underground, you have given me an idea just now Luna. We run a fake news story that the visitors have later died in hospital as a result of their injuries. We also state that there was some memory screening done and the information will not be released until the end of the investigation.”

Luna considers this for a few minutes “We only get one chance to do this… can we really expect the residents of Plas to simply accept that they have died and left behind a message? I mean, I give them more respect than that.” Luna takes a deep breath. “I have an idea. What if we were to download the required personality changes into their existing minds, erasing their previous memories and replacing them with their Dream Machine experience?”

“Knowing that the next phase of existence is a bundle of nerves their physical bodies should reflect that and be made of energy. A ghost. To represent what is to come. This solution may be more difficult but it is also more profound.”

Lucy, Harlow and Dalton lay comatose in hospital beds, an IV in their arm to keep them asleep and electrodes on their heads attached to a computer. The screen will show images of what they see and recognize their emotions as they go through the experience. Luna is to watch the screen and record the experience to later assess the visitors nature and background

Luna gets ready to do her work, as she sits down and gets her paperwork ready her phone rings. It’s Helgan, the president of Mito. “Good morning Luna I have heard about the situation involving visitors what is the plan?”

Luna answers “Well, Wexle has made the offer that we use this incident as the opportunity for an experiment to bring religion to Organelle.”

“Fascinating, do you suppose we add to this idea? It would be a good opportunity for Mito to expand on its practice possibly we introduce a fictional story that follows the workings of the the Cosmic Wheel?”

Luna answers “We can try but should the story reflect the Dream Machine simulation?”

“Yes of course, possibly the story of the Cosmic wheel is a fiction of the visitors and their Demi Gods as their past this could be a fascinating experiment.”

“We will look into developing a story of their past and broadcast it as a documentary perhaps?”Helgan replies “It is just a thought, we will get to work and present it to you once we have it completed”

Luna returns with “Should we contact the leader of Endo, Mystique?”

Helgan is enthusiastic “Absolutely yes! She is the queen of propaganda this could be an amazing show! We will create a film and pretend it is derived from the memory scan it will be genius!”

Luna decides before she continues to reach out to Yeshua, the king of Nuc

“Sorry to bother you at this hour Yesuha but do you have time to talk?”

Yesuha answers with “I am quite busy however if this is regarding the incident I’m willing to speak with you on the subject”

“I am at a loss of what is to be done with these visitors so I am reaching out to all of you so we can develop a strategy”

Luna explains the current situation and the options that have been presented to Yeshua who is silent on the other end 

“This is indeed a great opportunity that we cannot waste. Listen to me, we can re program them into much more than what the Dream Machine has to offer. I propose when it comes to the Dream Machine that is simple propaganda and we program them instead with the basic principles of the worlds of our allies. We make them into prophets teaching their worlds in a way that is figurative and we see how Plas reacts. Make sure they are not killed and they have the time and opportunity to preach the message and have their behaviour divine.”

“How do you suppose we make their behaviour divine?” Asks Luna

“With the Walk of Virtue. We have them live accordingly to it’s teachings and to not behave outside of it’s laws. We will make them perfect in the eyes of future believers. We make them into mystics”

“I have high hopes for this experiment, Luna. We will put together a plan. If the people of Plas are smart they will listen to the visitors turned prophets.”

“I’m afraid.. Yesuha what if they are not?”

Yeshua is silent “We must make sure they listen even if we bedazzle them with it in the form of entertainment first. The message has to get out and we hope that somebody is paying attention”

“This is our chance to become a higher species, Luna, but we need the collective mindset to understand it and it’s importance for it to ever become a reality. I’m afraid that if we continue as a type zero civilization this world will destroy itself. We cannot allow such a thing.”

Luna asks, with a bit of nervousness in her voice “Should we meet? To discuss this?”

“Yes of course. You just finish your report and I will arrange a meeting for all of us as soon as possible. Best of luck to you on your findings I look forward to hearing about it.” Yeshua says as he hangs up.

Luna sits down in a leather chair next to the three bodies. She buries her face in her hands as she knows she’s not getting any sleep tonight. She thinks out loud “No sleep, plus meeting with world leaders, how do I keep it together? This is happening so fast how am I going to do this report in one night and present it first thing in the morning? *sigh* Okay I guess we’re doing this”

The Casa seems attractive to me as a platform. Though 65mm or 48mm not sure which burr set as there's not a lot of info on the 65mm yet. But I want to keep the punchy acidity and clarity, I'm not looking for a more blended cup.

1ir99zh,https://www.hesslerworldwide.com/product-page/gourmet-series-17-pc-cutlery-set,Hessler Cutlery Knives LIFETIME WARRANTY,"We purchased this set of Hessler Worldwide Gourmet Series 17 piece Cutlery Set from Sam’s Club 7 years ago. It included 8 steak knives, 1 multipurpose filet knife, 2 carving knives w/ fork tips, 1 Amazing Chef Knife, 2 pairing knives, 1 Robo-Whisk a 14-slot In-Drawer Knife Organizer and a Eco friendly Bamboo Cutting Board. We paid $199.00 for the entire set and walked out the door with the complete set in hand that day. 

The carving knives have came in extremely handy, that Robo-Whisk is my favorite handheld whisk that money can buy and the knives were extremely sharp and would cut through anything. I am the type of person that if it can not be washed in a dishwasher, I don’t want it. Even if I do accidentally end up with something that isn’t dishwasher safe, you can guarantee that I will push my limits and try it atleast once! The knives are dishwasher safe, and I’ve never washed them any other way. I don’t remember if the knives recommended dishwashing or no dishwashing, but I have NEVER hand washed my knives. Ever. 

Something I did not know at the time that we purchased this set is that there is a 100% guarantee lifetime warranty. I had earned a couple of dark spots, or rust specks on one or two of the knives in the first three years of owning them and so I decided to look it up and figure out how to remove the few spots that I had noticed on the knives. So I googled the name on the knives and found a customer service phone number that I had originally planned on only finding out what I needed to do to remove the spots. However, when the representative told me that I could purchase some “Bar Keepers Friend” and the small spots would  come right off, but also… if I wanted to ship the entire set to her that they will overnight us a brand new set. 

I was blown away! The best part was that we were actually missing one of our steak knives and I didn’t send the pairing knives or the Robot-Whisk or the bamboo cutting board OR the in drawer knife block. I only sent the knives.  Yet I received an entirely new set! 

Since having them replaced, my hubby and I have picked up a new grilling and smoking habit and we also often go to a month long Carnivore only every March, June, September and December. Needless to say, we have used these knives probably triple what we used the 1st set and I have noticed that the Chef Knife and the filet knife aren’t completely dull, they still cut through anything I’ve tried, but wouldn’t hurt to be sharpened. 

I figured there wouldn’t be any reason for Hessler to have to replace the entire set if they could just point me in the direction of a sharpening tool. The representative was having NONE of it & insisted, I ship them back so they could send me a brand new set. She was able to have someone remove the knife block out of the package because I just hate to see something go to waste. So, yep… our warranty is being fulfilled for a second time. She also let me know that it isn’t JUST the knives that have a warranty— it was any and every item that came along with the set and she wanted me to know that she put “something special” in with the replacements! 

Unbelievable! I had a 10 year warranty on my Ninja coffee machine and the wiggled their way out of the warranty when the machine quit working 4 years after! So I was amazed to find such a stand up company! 

Go get your FOREVER Cutlery Set! You can purchase them at their website which I have included a link to the exact set we purchased in their website!

Love all the misogyny and hate in here - disgusting jerk. See below before he deletes it:

See. Here we go with the over sensationalism that we can’t seem to get over since 2020. But this is why my creator friends privately recommended I get consent recorded- and we live in a single party consent recording state, so after the insanity of last year… guess what?

I did 😎

Little does this performative person who is chalking up what was just a bad date (yeah, I hated being there and literally asked her to leave multiple times) as something horrible- guess what? I voice message recorded our entire conversation that she’s talking about, and it exposes her for all her lies.

But fuck it, she wants to harm my career, so let’s expose her:

-“couch was wet”- yes the cleaners just left before we got there -“camera in room”- yes, as a public figure, I have a security system -“touched leg after she said “no””- beyond incorrect. I made a move, she looked at me odd, I pulled away and asked if it was okay and she specifically said “yes”. So I did it again and she said “no I didn’t mean yes like that, I meant it was okay that it happened” so I removed my hand. Mixed signals used to be “okay let’s move on” but in 2025, this evidently means the R word in our insane internet culture. -“intentionally bumping into her and touching during house tour”- I literally have no idea what she’s talking about, and lucky for me I have a security system to prove it. -“asked to take a bath or massage”- I tried to make a move ladies and gents. A HORRID thing to do. She rejected, and I was okay with it and moved on. Again, it’s 2025, so it means the R word I guess. -“sat down angry when she said no”- this is when I started recording because I know exactly how this BS works in todays cancelation economy. I sat down and was confused, because when I suggested anything, including just leaving, she said no. So I was puzzled and started to become concerned. -“trying to go to a weird dirt patch”- I eventually asked if she’d like to go for a walk since she wouldn’t leave, and in no way did I want to go go an hour long dinner with this woman. We went on a walk. My neighborhood doesn’t have side walks and cars were passing by close, so I suggested we walk in the small park near my place instead of the dark street with no visibility. Crazy shit. And yes I made a joke, something I’m known for never doing. -“asking sexual questions”- because she couldn’t tell me what she wanted to do and wouldn’t say if the suggestions were bad if because she felt uncomfortable being sexual or something else, this is where I did the ADULT thing and literally ASKED. Also known as consent. Which again, in 2025, is now the R word because everything is over sensationalized. -at this point I asked if I could call an uber for her and pay for it. No way i wanted to drive with this woman at that point. She was incapable of communicating anything and was weird the whole time and super sketchy… obviously I’m not surprised now. -and now I guess the uber driver was a creep too. Maybe she just can’t operate in society. Shocked. -“asked her on a second date”- I had no intention to ever see this woman again. I was being nice and suggested maybe we could get coffee sometime. -“seems this might be a patter- what? Making a move and being okay when it’s rejected? How evil. Potentially having consensual hook ups? What a disgusting thing! This woman is a literal child who clearly is incapable of existing in society if a bad date creates a response like this.

And because of people like her, I now have literally recorded consent for every sexual experience since last year because our culture is INSANE right now. Thank you to my creator friend behind the scenes who have recommended this. So if this is a “repeated pattern”, which no one has ever said, then good lucky lady- I know how the cancelation economy works. I’ve studied it. And I have all the proof I could ever need.

On top of that, nearly ever major cancelation in this past year has been refuted with facts and the attention seeking accuser loses all respect and possibilities for careers. But I think they deserve it. You try to ruin someone’s life with BS, you get what you are owed.

We need to end this over sensationalized performance bullshit. Bad dates happen. We all have an awkward experience. That night was one for me. We all survive.

Her name is Madison. She moved home in her mid twenties with her parents and refuses to work. She’s a failure in life. Her last date was 2 years ago and told me she “doesn’t trust men”. I should have taken all the red flags and ran.

Girl, you are reading this- we had an awkward date. I hated it. You hated it. I tried to make a move and you said no. It ended at that. I didn’t go to dinner because you were unable to hold a conversation and I didn’t want to sit across from you. I literally had to call and uber and force you to leave. With the security cams and voice recording worth about 20 minutes of conversation, you’re literally about to destroy your life trying to get your 30 seconds.

Hey fellow Redditors! 

I'm a guy in my 30s looking to connect with some cool people for chatting and maybe grabbing a coffee. I promise I’m way more interesting than that one guy who keeps posting cat memes (though I do appreciate a good cat meme)! 

A little about me: I’m a coffee enthusiast and have quite the brewing setup at home. My coffee brewing kit is basically the spaceship of coffee machines – if it had a turbo button and could launch me to Mars, I’d still be too busy perfecting my pour-over technique. Seriously, my friends joke that I’m one bad brewing session away from starting a “Barista Anonymous” group! 

Are you also a coffee lover? Or just someone who enjoys good banter over a cup of Joe? Let’s chat! 

Looking forward to finding my coffee companion (and maybe get a second opinion on my brewing skills – I swear the last cup definitely had hints of joy)!

This post will go into detail about Laddu Gopala and how to serve him. This was originally on Quora by Akshita Rajput but I've made some edits to make it more readable and descriptive.

# Who is Laddu Gopala?

First, we must understand who Laddu Gopala is.

[Black Laddu Gopala](https://preview.redd.it/n7j8i5b61mje1.png?width=736&format=png&auto=webp&s=2949cd9fe0208115459a61e68e1d7b8be5606b5a)

Laddu Gopala is not just a **pratimā** (idol) or a mere symbol of Lord Shri Krishna. **He himself is baby Krishna.** Without any doubt—**he is Krishna himself!**

Those who have Laddu Gopala with them must know that we are not the ones who ""bring"" him home; rather, **he himself arrives** to those who are blessed by his mercy. Even if you wish to serve him and bring him home, **you cannot do so unless he desires it.** There are many who want to bring Laddu Gopal home, but for some reason, it always gets postponed or delayed—this simply means that **our Lālā (baby gopala) does not wish to go there yet.**

**You cannot treat him like an idol or normal deity!** Though there is a process called **Prāṇa Pratiṣṭhā**, Laddu Gopala **automatically becomes prāṇa-pratiṣṭhita** the moment he enters your house. As you love and serve him with devotion, **he becomes alive in your home.** However, you can still follow the Prāṇa Pratiṣṭhā ritual to speed up this process of invoking the Lord to come alive in the form of the baby gopala deity. Here's a video you can follow for the ritual: [https://youtu.be/-YwoVMIiaDI](https://youtu.be/-YwoVMIiaDI) (English translated captions are available).

From the moment he arrives, **he becomes the boss of your house and family.** He takes ownership of the home and becomes the head of the family. **One must always remember this!** Since he is your owner, he also takes responsibility for everything in your life. **All you have to do is acknowledge his presence.**

One should not forget that he is a child—**we celebrate his chhaṭha (6th day after the birthday - a common ritual in India) and birthday!** He behaves like a real child—he craves love, care, attention, and food like any baby. Though he is God and does not ""need"" anything from anyone, **he allows you to serve him so that you stay connected with him.** He is **Līlādhara** (the one who performs divine pastimes), and through his divine play, he can make you feel as if he is your own baby, needing your love and care. Trust me—he can do anything! It is my personal experience and the experience of thousands of people who serve him.

You simply have to see him as your own child—a family member. **You can choose the relationship you share with him:**

* As a **mother or father** caring for their child.
* As a **son or daughter** whom you cherish.
* As a **sibling or best friend** with whom you share everything.

# How to Serve Laddu Gopal?

While serving him, always remember: **he is our beloved Lālā—naïve and innocent like a child.** Treat him exactly as you would treat a real child, but with extra love and care 😊

# Morning Routine:

[Laddu Gopala taking a bath](https://preview.redd.it/twiegkgh1mje1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1bddc15ff4a5617e2f63b3d0ba9384c75a2435e)

* Laddu Gopal gets hungry very easily as he is a growing child.
* As soon as he wakes up, **offer him food immediately**—the choice is yours: milk, biscuits (without eggs), dry fruits, or a light snack. You can also prepare a proper meal.
* Before feeding him, you may perform **Ācamana** (purification ritual). You can learn how to do this by searching for **""Laddu Gopala Achamana"" on YouTube.**
* After some time, offer him his main meal—**Dal, Chawal, Roti, Sabzi,** etc. or anything that you like which of course should be without onion and garlic. Ensure the food is not too hot; cool it down to a comfortable temperature.
* You can place **a Tulasi Patra (holy basil leaf)** in his food. If fresh Tulasi is not available, you can use **a Tulasi Kanṭhi mālā** and keep it beside his plate. This is totally up to you.
* Remind him to eat when the food has cooled down or cool down the hot food and feed him with your own hands. Do make sure you feed him with your own hands once.

# Daily Meals:

Even though the baby will adjust to your own diet and schedule, you stil can do something extra for him.

The main point is to not eat with offering. He's family and he's the priority. So never cheat, always offer what you want to eat and only eat what he eats.

* **Three meals a day**. You can also offer milk in the morning. Whatever suits you and you're able to offer, to the best of your abilities.
* You can offer him snacks during your tea time.
* Give him **water** in between meals, as he might get thirsty.
* **Lala loves sweets and kheer!**
* Do not offer him anything with caffeine (tea, coffee, soft drinks). Fruit juice and chocolates are acceptable.
* Everything you bring home for yourself must be **clean, hygienic, and free from onion, garlic, eggs, meat, mushrooms, and tamasic foods.** You can offer him:
   * **Snacks** (Khakhras, Samosas, Chocolates, Candies, etc.).
   * **Homemade Chinese Dishes** (since restaurant food usually contains onion and garlic, you should prefer cooking at home or bringing only sattvic food).
* Always **read the ingredients** before offering him anything, especially packaged foods. Some foods contain onion and garlic.

# Bhoga & Prasāda Sevā:

* The food offered to Laddu Gopal is called **Bhoga**.
* Once he eats it, it becomes **Prasāda** or holy remnants.
* **Eating Prasāda is sevā (service)**—finish it as soon as you receive it.
* While serving, you can pray: **""Oh sweet lālā, please have this bhoga. Thank you so much for letting me have this and letting me share this with you.""** Make sure you feed with your hands, the food should not be too hot.
* After offering, leave the plate in front of him for **5-10 minutes**, then you can ask for his permission before taking and having the prasāda.

# Seasonal Food Considerations:

* Do not offer unseasonal fruits or vegetables.
* **Winter Foods:** Lukewarm water, dry fruits, peanuts, winter sweets.
* **Summer Foods:** Buttermilk, lassi, cool milkshakes, ice cream, shrikhand, soaked almonds, sherbet, fruit juice.
* If possible, you can use separate utensils for cooking his food. If not, it's also acceptable, just make sure they're clean utensils. **Cooking while chanting bhajans is the best form of bhakti!**

# Daily Routine:

[Brass Laddu Gopala](https://preview.redd.it/eag7upnr1mje1.png?width=736&format=png&auto=webp&s=b53865207c3b86557a46ab8a56fb2ecadcb6c1f2)

1. **Morning:**
   * Wake him up **after taking a bath yourself.**
   * In winter, cover him with a **woolen blanket or soft cloth** according to the temperature.
   * Dress him appropriately—sweaters in winter, light cotton clothes in summer.
   * You can apply **alcohol-free itra (scent)** on him as part of **Itra Sevā.**
   * Show him a mirror and praise how adorable he looks—this is called **Darpaṇa (mirror) Sevā.**
2. **Noon:**
   * Let him nap for **2 to 3 hours.**
   * Place a **duvet (blanket or razai)** over him and a glass of water or food nearby.
   * Wake him up gently and offer him food.
3. **Night:**
   * Let him sleep comfortably in **cotton clothing during summer** and **woolens in winter.**
   * Make sure he doesn't feel heat in the summer. AC or fan is a must.
   * You can sing him a lullaby and ask him to sleep peacefully and put him to bed that way.
4. **Leaving Home:**
   * Never leave Laddu Gopal alone at home!
   * If no one is home, **leave snacks and water for him,** just like preparing a lunchbox for a child.
   * Imagine giving him the house keys and ask him to accompany you spiritually.
   * If you are away for long hours, do **Mānasika Sevā** (mental service) by imagining yourself performing his daily routines.
5. **Returning Home:**
   * Always bring something for him, even if it's just a small toffee.
   * Greet him lovingly and ask, **""Did you miss me?""** or **""How was your day?""**

# Seva During Menses & Sūtaka Kāla (Eclipse, Birth/Death in Family):

Though he is our Lālā, **he is still God.**

* During menstruation or **Sūtaka Kāla**, ask anyone in your family to cook his food and kitchen and ask them to offer it to him. Pray, asking him to accept it.
* Avoid direct physical contact if someone else at home can serve him, continue serving him mentally.
* If you're the only person responsible for your lālā, make sure you're clean and continue doing your sevā like you would on the other days. You wouldn't leave your baby just because you're not completely clean, would you?
* Maintain cleanliness and personal hygiene when visiting the temple or performing seva.

Laddu Gopal is **not just an idol or regular deity—he is our beloved Krishna in baby form. He's family, never forget that!** Serve him with love, devotion, and faith, and he will always stay in your heart and home.

Hope it’s ok to post this in r/decaf!

I had been wanting to quit drinking caffeine for years because I know I’m pretty sensitive to it. I already don’t coffee because it gives me cystic acne, but I did drink 1-2 cups of green tea daily for years. I get really bad PMS so I finally decided I was ready to quit my tea to see if it helps. 

It’s been a little over a month now, and I have never slept so much in my life. I had multiple 12 hour sleeps, and 8 hours has become my minimum, which is amazing because I struggled with varying levels of insomnia for years. However, it’s been practically impossible to drag myself out of bed, I could probably sleep 12 hours every day if I wanted to, and stillll be tired! I’ve been super unproductive and tired all month, but I was kind of prepared for that. 

So the sleep has been nice and exhausting at the same time, was hoping it would balance out with time. But now I’m on my first period since quitting and it’s the worst one I’ve had since being a child. PMS was still there and it has been sooo heavy. First three days or so were light and i thought I was having a great cycle, but then I started bleeding super heavily for 2-3 days. I was soaking through a super tampon every hour and there were so many huge clots as well. This is super abnormal for me, sometimes it’s heavy but only for a couple hours, not days! Now I’m on day 8 which is very long compared to my regular 5 day cycles, and while it has slowed down a little, it’s still what I would consider heavy and isn’t showing any signs of stopping in the next couple days, maybe I’ll be lucky though!

Has anyone else experienced something like this? Or have any idea how this could relate to quitting caffeine? It’s a very unwanted side effect, don’t know if I will continue decaf . . .",4,1739758460.0,decaf,2,1.0,False

Ended up with unknown untreated GERD (mainly due to my reflux being silent 95% of the time) that had me with heavy vertigo, nausea, anxiety, body heat, migraines etc. Due to the symptoms being common among other issues it has taken a while for me and the doc to figure out it was GERD. 

Thought it was CHS recently so I went back to an average diet, which has brought up these symptoms to a strong affect fairly rapidly. Leading me to believe it is GERD rather than CHS. The confusion between the two was likely because marijuana triggered reflux very very heavily. So when I stopped that my symptoms did get alot better, but I also improved my diet alot at the same time.

Im on medication and have adjusted my diet again which is fixing up the heavy symptoms fairly quickly.

I find at its worst when I have an empty stomach I can literally hear my ears crackling which is likely the inner ear issues being worsened. But when it happens at night I don't want to eat because that can also worsen it when laying down.

I will miss coffee, alcohol mostly.

Has anyone else had it quite bad like myself but find a strict diet followed can lead to a coffee a week and a night of alcohol each week?

Now, it seemed to me that Mahomes replaced Brady, so it was great to see him get swarmed with green.

Now to the reactions I got.  Monday after SB, I got dressed in my eagles gear, dropped off the kids at school and went to grab a cup of coffee. I was blasting Motownphilly, had my funko pop of Hurts on my dashboard and came in to the coffee shop and started talking to some locals about what a great win it was.

Unfortunately, very few people seemed like they cared. All I heard about was how the commercials sucked an the half time show didn't live up to expectations. I told them the only performance that mattered was the one on the field and got back on the car to play Motownphilly a second time.

It was a bit of a let down but it just added fuel to the underdog fire. That being said, as I traveled to central Florida, found some excited fans in Orlando. Got a couple of reactions to my Philly hat, so it was great to see. Go birds!!!",4,1739758350.0,eagles,3,1.0,False

41 years old folks....crazy.

Let's start by saying this experience was slightly different than the 1984 Menu 12 I reviewed last week. My youngest son was right there again helping unpack and take pics.

The main in this one was not good and did not get eaten. I did try a few small bites, dry, and tangy are how I would describe it with a thicker sauce than the spiced beef had. 

The freeze dried peaches were not vacuum sealed nearly as well as the strawberry brick last week and were emitting an odor that did cause some hesitation, but after the 1st bite, I realized they were fantastic. Perhaps a bit oxidized but a really nice treat indeed. I am still shocked as to why these are not in current MREs as they are amazing. I'd love to get my hands on the ever elusive freeze dried pears that I've heard did come in these but not nearly as often. 

I did eat 1 carmel, they didn't smell too bad but boy did they taste bad. 

The PB and crackers were absolutely delightful just like last time. Such a shame how far this beloved snack has fallen.

The 2 chocolate covered cookies, unlike last time, were perfect and fully consumed!

Had the 41 year old coffee with the sugar the next morning and it was great! Creamer was not used but kept as a momento.

The blue TP was sent to Hwystitch so he could give it to his granddaughter, I hope it makes her smile!

Another great experience!

Rocamadour. The very name evokes images of medieval castles clinging to cliffs, ancient chapels echoing with prayer, and a sense of history that whispers from every stone.  This stunning sanctuary, perched dramatically on a cliff face in the Dordogne region of France, is more than just a beautiful place; it's a journey through time and a deeply spiritual experience. Whether you're a devout pilgrim or simply a curious traveler, Rocamadour will leave a lasting impression.

**What Makes Rocamadour So Special?**

Rocamadour's unique charm stems from its breathtaking location and rich history.  Nestled into a sheer cliffside, the village and sanctuary seem to defy gravity, a testament to human ingenuity and faith.  For centuries, pilgrims have flocked to Rocamadour, drawn by the legend of the Black Madonna, a statue of the Virgin Mary housed in the Chapel of Notre-Dame.  This statue, believed to possess miraculous powers, is a significant draw for visitors from all over the world.

**Exploring the Sanctuary: A Step-by-Step Guide**

Exploring Rocamadour is a journey of discovery.  Here's a suggested itinerary:

1. **The Lower Village (Bourg):** Begin your exploration in the charming lower village, filled with souvenir shops, cafes, and restaurants.  Enjoy the atmosphere and grab a coffee before embarking on your climb.

2. **The Grand Staircase (Grand Escalier):**  The Grand Staircase, with its 217 steps, is a physically challenging but rewarding climb.  Take your time, and appreciate the views that unfold with each step.  Alternatively, you can take a more accessible path via the road.

3. **The Sanctuary:**  At the top, you'll find the sanctuary itself, a collection of chapels and churches, each steeped in history and spiritual significance.  Explore the Chapel of Notre-Dame to see the Black Madonna, and take a moment for reflection in the serene atmosphere.

4. **The Castle:** For a more comprehensive experience, consider visiting the castle, offering panoramic views of the valley and a glimpse into the region's medieval past.

**Tips for Your Visit:**

1ir8wtb,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ir8wtb/i_have_a_child_with_satan/,I have a child with Satan,"I need to get this off my chest. If you’re going to read this then strap in for a very brutal and toxic story. 

I’ve never met someone as evil as you. 

I sold my apartment and opened a vet clinic for you/us so we could support ourselves and I went on maternity leave. I thought you were different but then you messaged your friend that we don’t love each other but oh well who else is going to open a clinic for you. Unfortunately you were already pregnant so from that moment on I was doing things for the sake of my child ignoring the biggest fucking red flag right in the beginning. 

After meeting your mum who instantly labelled me by my race and said my daughter would never be a doctor like her daughter because she’s dark like me. I realised what the fuck I had actually gotten myself into. 

You randomly came from work and told me your nurses brother cooked a bucket of crack just for fun. (Knowing fully that I was sober 3 years) which continues into you lying to my face for 3 whole days until I just tell you don’t you feel pathetic constantly lying? 

You leave your coffee cups on the cushion of the couch right next to you with coffee still in it. Your iqos cigarette butts are behind every bed and couch no matter how many times a clean. Your so rude to people and whenever I try to communicate with you of course you just roll your eyes and continue 

The nurse that you were so casually talking about drugs with during working hours, you fired. And she reported you for salary fraud which started a police investigation and they came to pick you up from our home. Never a single thank you just lies on lies 

You slapped me in front of my friend who flew over 30 hours to stay with us and you called me an unemployed gypsy because I said a girl was pretty. Your so insecure 

You locked the keys in the house and while I’m calling a locksmith your yelling at me and ended up leaving me and my daughter outside in the cold 

When I got therapy for us you cancelled it and said you don’t care. Instead you forwarded my messages to your friend and laughed saying look how pathetic he is.

A client sent you a dick pick and she’s flirting some guy online but when I show her it’s “how dare you go into my phone” 

You’re so delusional and rude that while someone is talking on the phone, mid way you just start talking over them and hang up. When I say like you probably shouldn’t say that it’s quite rude you literally just lie to yourself immediately and say oh but I didn’t say that. It’s quite amazing how ridiculously pathetic you have become all because you’re making some money. 

Your mum spends many days and nights fasting and praying 100 hail maries for her daughter to return home. 

I asked you not to feed my dog and you fed her a hole box of raw garlic sausages and she died in my arms. You as a vet still don’t believe that it was your fault even though she started throwing up straight after you fed her. And your mum was the best. Apparently my dog wanted to die because of all the demons in my house. 

You say you organised insurance for our cars which are under my name. Then I get a random bill for 13k czk and actually none of the cars are insured. Then you call me pathetic and say you are sick of supporting me and paying bills. (Bills that I did not make) but it’s ok I will have my own thing soon and will pay you back for everything you think you payed for. 

Even when you clearly are aware of how horrible you are being, you never bother to apologise for anything which turns into week long stand offs because your ego is actually that fucking huge that like a normal person when you do something stupid you kind of acknowledge the other person and apologise for hurting them but you just don’t seem to have that emotion inside of you. You actually enjoy watching people in pain… it’s so weird. 

You hate your job and you’re never happy.you beat our dog for no reason (she was lying on the carpet and Satan didn’t like that) she tries to ask me how much money certain people make to charge them more for surgeries. Just everything fucking fake, inside and out. Disgusting human. Not human. Satan 

who ever has read this far, thank you and please learn from my mistakes and don’t have a child with someone until you are absolutely ready!! 

I’m starting my own thing I invested a little over 40k usd into this vet clinic and I’m happy I did it for my child. But I’m fucking exhausted and I’m done. I will have my own place soon and continue enjoying life with my daughter as a single dad. 

She deserves better.

Park on Fremont (our Fav), Cheapshot and Commonwealth. Minimum spend is $4.2-$4.5k

Loved the vibes but I’m really not sure about the catering menu. It’s provided by an outside kitchen - it’s your standard event menu: apps, pasta bar, taco bar, or protein potato veg. The bar package is liquor and a mixer, didn’t seem to have a custom cocktail option.

The food and drinks at Carson Kitchen was out of this world! Cocktails were delicious and the menu was exciting: coco and coffee rubbed steak, boozy carrots, super fresh beet salad… we loved everything. AND! It has a cheaper minimum spend ($3k)

Their rooftop patio is nice but it has this weird mural of an iron chef. Pic above. 

I was cracking up, what an odd thing to put in an otherwise classy event space. I think I could get over it, or maybe they would let me put up a banner?

I work at a small indie coffee shop. I’m the longest running employee though I took a year away for school (started in Jan 2022, left summer 2023, came back summer ish 2024). The second longest employee started in fall 2022. We’re both technically managers but it’s pretty much the two of us and one other worker since the place isn’t open any longer than 5 hours a day. Anywho, our bosses, mainly just one, don’t really treat us with any respect. It’s worse for me than for her. They don’t listen to our worries or our advice. They don’t bother to trust our judgment when it comes to inventory when we’re there everyday the business is open (it led to us having 5 cabbages when we barely go thru half in two weeks). The business started off as a passion project for the owners for just the weekends in early 2021, then they started to hire people to help out, then they took a more hands off approach, then they opened for the week, then we became more popular, and now they feel the need to follow in the footsteps of bigger cafes or corporate chains when the reason many of our regulars come back is because we don’t have that vibe. Since I came back it’s been somewhat chill, we’ve had a couple employees come and go, but since the holidays, there’s been something we’ve done wrong every week if not every day. Some things are understandable and I respect, but most of the time it’s silly and just aggravating. 
Just a couple examples-
1. when we got a new table for the coffee bar, I switched our tiny ass ice machine and the pastry case so the pastry case wasn’t in a position for customers to just freely open it. One of my bosses comes in super excited about the big new upgrade we got, sees that I changed things and starts yelling at me about how I always do this type of thing, how I think I just own the place, yadda yadda while there’s customers around. And for some context, me and the other manager will deep clean and reorganize when it’s slow. When we reorganize we make sure how we do it is efficient and works for us in our respective areas since we are working everyday in the same areas. We want to make our lives easier. But it doesn’t matter if my coworkers moved something somewhere for one reason or another, it’s usually my fault
2. For music I like to play a variety of things and on some days I like more ambient lofi style beats so everything that I or my coworkers like to hear are compiled in a huge playlist that we shuffle. Those songs are on there. Sometimes there’s a second or two of no noise between songs. It’s normal. Anyways, whenever the same boss comes in to pick up his food or is just around sometimes a chill song comes on or there’s a beat of silence, usually followed by a song with more tempo, he just goes crazy. Talking about how he could never work with this kind of silence, that were putting the customers to sleep (the same customers who are always complimenting the music), that no one will feel inspired by it. He’ll walk around for five minutes like “where’s the music, what happened is it not working again? until he turns up the music to ungodly volume. During Christmas, it was a similar vibe but he would get SO upset whenever there wasn’t Christmas music playing. We got so many complaints from customers about loud music or about the Christmas music it just baffles me he doesn’t want to listen to customers on the most basic fucking thing about a cafe.

There are many more examples but those are the most prominent in my head. The thing that led me to make this post was I just received an email from him to the entire staff (me and two others) about how they’ve decided to lock the cash tips and only one person besides the same boss I’ve described will get a key for it, the other manager. And it was kind of my last straw. We get paid DOGSHIT, and we cannot clock in earlier than 30 minutes before we open (it can take up to 45 minutes to prepare for the day) so we can’t get more than 30 hours a week. Our digital tips are really just a cushion for what we make hourly after taxes and shit. And we split all the tips two-three ways depending on who’s working, so for cash it’s like maybe $1 per person on a slow day and maybe $20 per person on a busy day. I’ve worked for a place that locked up cash tips, they never gave us the money and kept it for themselves, so I’m just freaking out over that. But it’s also kinda fucking stupid? Like I don’t know why they decided to do that but it feels like they’re accusing one of us of stealing from the others? I didn’t respond to it, I probably won’t, I’ve been off this week, I don’t want to ruin my peace. But I’m just kinda done with it. I don’t hate what I do. I don’t hate my customers. Hell, I don’t even hate the bitches that give me attitude when they first walk in. I love every aspect of my job except for my boss and their lack of care for me and my coworkers. I started working there when I was 18, I’m turning 22 next month. I have wasted too much of my youth and time at a place that won’t even say thank you or acknowledge how much I’ve put in to make it successful. Its made me feel so insecure in my abilities as a worker and leader. I want to quit but I don’t even know what to do if I did. This place has been part of my identity for so long that it feels like I’m disowning a family member lol.

1ir8qr3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1ir8qr3/healed_different_advice_than_you_might_expect_but/,"Healed! Different advice than you might expect, but important.","Hi all,

I’m seeing a lot of people on here struggling and I want to share what I’ve learned from my *really* hard 10 month journey. I had gastritis, could barely eat or sleep, had many hospital visits, gas buildup, 10/10 pain cramping in abdomen and chest for days on end, nervous system problems, and much more. 

What worked for me is a bit different than the conventional advice you see on here, but it was SO important for me to figure this out. I think a lot of the mainstream advice is well intentioned but misses the mark in a few ways. I’ve heard many people who have had similar stories to mine, and no we are not all the exact same, but I hope everyone can read this and be helped in some way bc I know how hard it is. It’s a long read and it may be very counter-intuitive at times but I think it will be well worth your time. 


Here’s what I’d tell myself if I could go back in time:

You need to eat bigger meals. I know - you can’t eat more. But here’s the deal: not eating enough is causing more problems than it’s fixing. 

1. Go back to three bigger (normal) meals a day
2. Eat more fat/build your fat tolerance
3. Get some protein (stimulates your stomach acid the correct way)
4. Actively get enough fiber (20g)

Yes, I understand you can’t do this. It hurts, you get a flair up, etc. 

But I found out you actually CAN do this and here’s how + the reasoning behind it.

Your body wants food. Fat is what gets your digestion stimulated properly. Protein especially causes acid to be released. Carbs should come after your healthy fats and proteins for slower glycemic release.

It might really help you to start your meals with significantly more fats and proteins because your acid actively works on that stuff instead of your own stomach and/or esophagus. If you’re just eating carbs and low fat, your acid eats through those carbs and you’re still hungry so it basically starts eating through your own tissue and going to the wrong places. When your stomach is settled and full, it stops freaking out and producing acid. More than that, it sends the right signals to your entire digestive system. 

You have to train your body to expect it. It’s like a muscle, and if it doesn’t like a healthy meal, try again in a day or two and keep trying bc it will eventually adapt and build tolerance. If you start feeling that acid pain, ease off for a bit but then try again, maybe with something a bit different but maybe the same thing. The goal is to get to eating bigger meals and not have much or any of that stinging or sharp pain. 

Stop listening to all the BS about what you can and can’t eat. All you need to do is not stimulate your stomach acid too much with lots of sugar, coffee, vinegar, alc, etc and consume things healthily for a long time. It may not feel great at first or it may be totally fine, but you can work up to having good tasting healthy meals (and they should be good tasting). 

My nervous system was totally out of wack until I started eating bigger meals a few days in a row and figuring out how to do that in a healthy way that had the least pain. Before I literally was bedridden and had horrible abdomen cramping all the time.  And a million other things. It’s been like 10 mo since it started and 3 mo since I’ve been eating more normally. It can get better! 

But you HAVE to figure out how to eat again, that’s what your body wants. I just slowly had more and more fats and proteins, went through an uncomfortable adjustment period of time, and then my whole body kind of slowly snapped back into action. It took time and it was really hard for a while not being able to eat.

I had bad breath weird tastes and all kinds of weird reflux and gas buildup + more. Unexplained symptoms, feelings, insane anxiety etc. It’s almost all gone besides a bit of reflux. The bottom line is your stomach sends signals to your whole body to open things up, push things through, etc. When you deprive it of food your symptoms get WORSE bc those signals become dysfunctional and that’s why it’s so hard. At my worst I would dry heave after anything, even water. But the answer is the healthy fats and proteins. Get your body settled down even if there is a bit of an adjustment period getting used to the additional fat and stimulation. You might find something that’s safe but gets you enough calories to fall back on if things get painful. Mine was white rice and cooked chicken with olive oil and almond butter. The problem with that is it’s not enough fat to keep you satiated but it at least it was food that was comfortable. But then TRY to eat a bigger meal and then see how it went and then try again in a day or two. See if it was a little better the second time, 3rd time 4th time etc. 

The trick is to get actual meals with substance, none of this stupid small meals every two hours, that’s the advice I got too but what human has ever felt good doing that for an extended period of time? It makes you too hungry too quickly stimulating more acid. It makes flare ups WAY more likely along with not eating enough *settling* foods like fats and proteins. You’re supposed to get hungry, eat a bunch of food, let your body do its thing for 4 hrs or so and get hungry again. That’s how you used to do it that’s how your ancestors did it and that’s what your body is wanting to do. Get enough fiber as well, that’s huge. If things aren’t moving well (very common with calorie restriction) then the whole system starts breaking down. I still sometimes have loose stool and sometimes get a bit constipated, don’t even worry about that just get enough fiber and water and it will be okay. 

I know the feeling of wanting to give up very well. I just kept trying to eat and finally my body healed and normalized enough to where I could start *handling* the food again which is what you want as well. It’s all about your body adapting to the new influx of food and then making sure it’s healthy so the acid isn’t going too crazy. But you NEED acid to be produced in the right way hence the need for lots of healthy food. If it doesn’t work well one day try again later eventually your body will start getting used to it and you’ll be on a path towards functionality. It’s all about having a good lifestyle for a really long time and lots of healthy food. Well sourced chicken, ground beef, etc would be really good and your body will do really well with them. I have oatmeal and squash and black beans for a lot of my fiber. I do a whole grain chicken rice bean and a bit of cheese burrito pretty often. Potatoes sometimes got me a little nauseous but now I’m sure I could have them no problem. Fruits would cause some burping and discomfort. 

One way of thinking about it is you kind of need to stop being a smart human and be more like a dumb animal. As in, your smart brain knows if you eat you’ll feel bad, but your brain has taken that way too far. An animal would just keep eating what it’s meant to be eating and its body would figure the rest out over time. I could be wrong but I don’t think tigers get GI issues, but dogs do largely because we feed them unnatural food that feels a bit different for their bodies to process than just actual meat. It’s like that with humans, we need the right *types* and *amounts* of substance going down the hatch. We want a long term solution like this as opposed to “try a few bites of this and that”. It just doesn’t work like that and I found that out the hard way. The actual smart thing to be doing is just the avoidance of the bad offenders like fast food and alcohol. And even that can get more doable over time but it’s best to stay healthy for life. 

And keep trying over and over again until something works for you! Your body probably used to work great and it knows what to do when it has the right food coming in. The right *amount* of food is so important, you need to give your acid something to work on for a while. A few bites of fast food used to make my stomach start having these insane spasms and now it’s totally fine when I eat large amounts of fast food. It made 0 sense at the time but that’s just one example of this concept of having enough food to settle you down. I actually got to a point where I had to keep eating big meals or I’d start feeling bad again, I started going through 3000+ cals without gaining a pound but I felt so much more energetic, less anxious, etc. But I worked up to that after barely eating anything for 5 months and now if I want to I could do a little fasting if I wanted to (which also can stimulate too much acid).

You were built to be this amazing complex regenerating machine that can take in almost anything, use what is needed and expel the rest. Pretty much everything in your body can and will heal with the right intake of food and time. Your body will do all the work for you so don’t worry so much about that, all you have to do is give it the right supply and I promise you’ll feel better over time. It’s just so hard to imagine life without the problems you’re having and I get that feeling, but many GI issues can really drastically get better quickly (or worse quickly). I didn’t feel good on PPIs, way better off healing naturally anyway in my humble opinion. I literally looked like a (barely) walking twig always in pain and now I’m building muscle. It can change and it will change! Not everything is perfect still for me. But I *barely notice anything* now. I wanted to empower you and show you there is absolutely a way out of this. It takes time and it can really suck but there’s a light at the end of the tunnel. I’m rooting for you!!",6,1739757214.0,Gastritis,3,0.75,False

I made a post two years ago regarding my situation at that time, and it had connected me with kind folks that gave me much needed advice. And last year, I was finally able to confront my ex (after 10 years) so that I could get my closure. What I didn't expect however was that I greatly misunderstood his living situation. Yes, he did have a child and was married. Key emphasis on the word ""was"" because he was actually in the process of getting separated with his wife. Apparently, they've been planning that for years but never really went through for the sake of giving their child a complete family. Things grew worse as time went on, and they didn't want the child to grow up in a broken family that forcefully tries to appear alright. And yes, he did admit that he named his son after me.

My emotional response after hearing all of that was overwhelming. We were both bawling our eyes out and it just felt so surreal. For the longest time ever, I thought I did not have a chance anymore. Honestly, I don't think I deserve a chance since I was the one who left him a decade ago. We were living together at that time and both of us did not earn much. On top of that, I had a family that I was still supporting. It was a lot for me and I felt I was sinking. U thought that if I stay with him longer, he might sink with me. And after leaving him, I did. I was do depressed and had no will to live. What I failed to realize sooner was that he was my life jacket. He kept me afloat all that time. I was so stuck looking at the bottom, I did not see how close I was to the surface. Even after breaking up, he saved me. With the fragments of our time together, it helped me pick myself up. 

Fuck, it feels so great to be alive now. This was something I've always dreamt and I just can't believe this is now my reality. Going back to our meetup, we remained in contact after that. And just after two weeks, we were already dating. My head was swirling with ideas of what I wanted to do with him, so that I can make up with the lost time. But I realized that I have a lifetime to spend with him so I should take my time. There's still a lot of uncertainty with what the future holds but I don't have to worry about that since I'm facing it with the love of my life. 

We're actually living together again. He has a new job which is WFH so he spends most of his time in my coffee shop. He doesn't know how to make or serve the food so he justs helps with cleaning. His son also visits frequently. I've actually gotten close to him easily because he gets free treats whenever we see each other. He already knows that I'm with his father which doesn't really bother him. He actually relishes on that since he's receiving three more presents during the holidays and on his birthday. His mother is also dating too, and we all spent the holidays together. This child is really lucky to have such loving parents. But apart from that, I also spent my first Valentine's after 11 years. I never really got to celebrate the holiday since I was mostly single and even if I dated someone, it never really lasted or was active during that day. I spent a long time planning but we ended up spending the day in our home. We both cooked and just watched movies. As simple as it sounds, I really loved it. And I have any day of the year to take him to outside dates. I am just really happy that we are together.

I worked a coffee job for the past 3+ years. I originally loved this job and what the company stood for, and I put my all in and the boss/owner was even vocally appreciative of the hard work I put in. 

Then about a year ago, the culture started to get very toxic and cliquey due to my new manager above me. I’d considered all the coworkers friends until this point but when it started to shift more toxic, I tried to distance myself and keep out of it. This led to me being targeted by my manager, and I even got a write-up that was all false claims of my work ethic and character. I handled it professionally and tried to continue to work with my head down.
It was then brought to my attention that my manager went as far as to go into my google account on the company computer, so I reported this as well as other fireable offenses (drug use on shift, drinking in the shop after hours, etc.). The owner claimed to have done a thorough investigation into these claims, but nothing came of it. 

Then about 6 months later, I got called in for a meeting with no explanation and got fired. It was again all untrue claims of misconduct against my manager and another coworker who is close with my manager (whom had been openly rude to my friend and I in the weeks leading up to this). It was all written in a narrative because if it were strictly factual actions, there would be nothing. There were even “quotes from me badmouthing my manager” that were words I had never spoken before, but since all of it was her word versus mine, the owner was not willing to listen to anything I had to say and was extremely cold to me. Needless to say, it was very disappointing that after everything I did, my employment there was reduced to lies on paper that I couldn’t even refute.

I guess my question now is how to professionally handle the questions I’ll inevitably get in future job interviews about why I left/was fired from my last company. I already can’t put down references from my previous boss nor manager due to this whole situation, but now I’m worried I’ll be unable to get another job since there’s no way to explain why I was fired and/or can’t provide references. Any advice? 

Tl;dr: nasty people doing nasty things caused me to get fired from my last job. How do I approach this for future job interviews?",5,1739757152.0,careeradvice,5,1.0,False

I know he doesn’t. I’m one person among thousands. There’s nothing about me that makes me stand out. 

There’s a cognitive dissonance. And I can’t break it.

After I shower I stand naked in front of my mirror. It’s full length, I can see the entirety of my form. I’ve been trying to lose weight but I’m bad at resisting temptation. I stare at my lack of hips and wide waist and broad shoulder and ugly feet. I stare at my breasts. That’s the worst part, I’d say. The breasts.

And it’s not something that could be alleviated by a boob job either, at least not a typical one. They’re wide and far apart and saggy and my areolas are far too big. My breasts don’t fit my frame. I dislike them immensely.

I think about my body everyday, and I have since I was a teen. It’s driving me nuts. I’ve almost killed myself over it. And then I realized that was stupid. But the temptation is still there. Again, cognitive dissonance.

1ir8d5o,https://i.redd.it/hnl2cqhxrlje1.png,Review of MSC Cruises on the Meraviglia Ship (Brooklyn-Bahamas),"Our experience aboard the Meraviglia Ship was mostly enjoyable, with a few areas for improvement. The entertainment options were engaging, with a variety of activities to keep us entertained throughout the voyage. The food was decent, with some options standing out more than others. The staff, for the most part, were very hospitable, making an effort to ensure guests were comfortable. Our interior cabin was a reasonable size, though the bathroom and shower felt a bit tight, especially for larger guests.
That said, there were aspects of the trip that could have been better. The lack of transparency regarding upcharges, gratuities, and tipping expectations was frustrating. Understanding the drink packages and dining options also took some effort. Finding areas beyond the pool and buffet was not always straightforward due to the ship's layout, and the limited number of adult hot tubs—some of which weren’t always hot—was disappointing. Additionally, the pool was closed several times, and long port clearance times disrupted planned excursions and activities.
Another puzzling decision was having DJs perform outdoors on chilly nights instead of utilizing interior venues. The early closing of adult nightlife areas also left something to be desired. The buffet layout was somewhat confusing, and the lack of food labels made choosing dishes a bit of a guessing game. Additionally, some bars served coffee and tea that lacked flavor, and the fountain juices seemed to be of lower quality. Fresh fruit options, particularly bananas and berries, were limited.
Unfortunately, the most concerning issue of our trip was a deeply unsettling personal experience. A drunk guest was mistakenly escorted into our locked cabin by security late at night while my partner and I were in bed. This was an incredibly alarming and distressing incident. Despite reporting it multiple times, the response was slow, and the resolution felt inadequate—a simple explanation and a one-time courtesy lunch at a specialty restaurant. There was no formal professional apology, which made the situation even more unsettling. My partner remained in fear for the rest of the cruise, leading us to place our luggage against the door at night for added security. This experience cast a shadow over an otherwise enjoyable trip.
Overall, while we did have some great moments on board, the lack of transparency regarding charges, the ship’s layout challenges, and—most significantly—the mishandling of our personal security incident were disappointing. With better organization, clearer communication, and stronger attention to guest safety, this could have been a much more positive experience.",3,1739756041.0,MSCCruises,0,1.0,False

That time, I was super focused on my work, so I wasn’t able to respond. And just like that, she got mad na. 

I apologized right away, saying I was just focused on my task, but she ignored me. After 30 minutes, I said sorry again, nothing. After an hour, I tried again, still nothing. At this point, I’m getting really frustrated na rin because we’ve fought about this exact thing so many times. The unfair part is, there have been plenty of times when she ignored me while she was working, and I didn’t make a big deal out of it because I understood she was busy.

What made me even more frustrated was that, earlier, I made her coffee and a sandwich, but she threw the coffee away and didn’t eat the sandwich. I can’t find it anywhere, so I’m guessing na tinapon niya rin.

It’s just frustrating because she knows from the start that I’m not the most talkative person, but I always try when she shares something with me. We’ve fought multiple times because she says I’m not “responsive enough” to her stories.

I don’t know, I just needed to let this out instead of arguing with her again.

I love an unpretentious vibe along with staring at a menu that makes me start secretly googling ingredients under the table.

I was that days year old when I learned that Western Australia has their own type of crayfish that is absolutely delicious (Marron - photo #1), and the pairing with black garlic, macadamia and fennel is nothing short of genius and makes your thinking brain shut down for a while as your body is experiencing the intense flavors.

Another standout dish for me was the Blue Mackerel (photo #2) that they are deservingly known for (in different variations).

My grandma has been going especially off the handle the last week or so at me no matter what i do and i’m really close to a breaking point of snapping at her. i’ve always been very obedient and done everything she’s asked me exactly the way she wants me, she wanted me to quit my job so i could stay and look after her and i did, major sacrifices sorta stuff.

the past 5 days have been treacherous to say the least, she’s been irritable, angry, screaming and hysterical and i just need some coping mechanisms. typically i just tune out and autopilot whatever she wants me to do but even if i do the thing she wants it isn’t good enough or isn’t done right and she will scream for hours at me about how im hurting her and doing her oh so wrong.

it all started when my grandfather (non narcissist) noticed a big slit in the roof above a kitchen panel we had, upon inspecting it he noticed that it was a TERMITE nest due to her neglect of the house. he proceeded to cut 3 2.5x2.5 inches in the wall along to see how far the infestation had gone and it’s gone roughly three feet across both sides into the walls. he stripped the kitchen to cut these holes in the walls and neither of us have heard the end of it since, she has gone into hysteria that her kitchens been ruined and it’s all my fault because i had put some cans out in the kitchen the night before to take out to the recycling in the morning but all he did was declutter and move all her trinkets to the table to sort and put away. (she hoards) 

ever since that day i’ve been woken up all hours of the day and night being given ridiculous tasks  (walking to a gas station at night to get her milk so she could have coffee, etc) and being screamed at and ridiculed and blamed for the kitchen, she’s been angry irritable and honestly insane and i don’t know how much longer i can bite my tongue. any advice would help. leaving is not an option at this point in time.

(Just to vent),"As I said, I'm just here to vent. There's a guy at my college who came up to me out of nowhere, tried to make a quick conversation with me (because we were both in a rush) and asked me for my contact number (even though I gave him my IG lol, but eventually my phone number as well). 

The thing is that after 2 days he asked me if I wanted to go out for a coffee the following week and even tried to make short conversations with me via text. This took me by surprise because I really had no clue if it was in a friendly way or had another type of interest/intention. We met up and it was chill, nothing obvious happened that made me think he wanted something more. I'm not used to going out on one-to-one with guys and since I don't know him, there's really nothing for me to decipher. The most noticeable things he mentioned was having an ex, didn't like having a clingy person (talking about why he preferred cats rather than dogs, so it lead there), and probably exchanged looks. 

After, I texted him saying thank you for paying and that I enjoyed talking to him. Also, I mentioned something I noticed about the coffee shop and he replied to me it can be something we can consider next time only if I wanted to hangout with him again. 

3 days went by and he hasn't texted me. I decided to make up a conv but I felt he was just only answering to my texts and not trying AT ALL by asking me other things to follow me. 

I am still confused whether what was his initial intention and probably won't ever ask him lol. I just left him on read because I don't know what else to say to keep it up so there's that (I asked him if he played an instrument and that I wanted to learn too. He lastly recommended an academy, I don't know what else to say so i'm not planning to reply anymore). 

Maybe it was quite obvious that I was trying to make up a conversation with him. I feel ashamed and awkward, but I'm not insisting anymore and let it be.

Now, I'm nervous about encountering him at college because the place is not that big. So I'll try to avoid sitting at the entrance for a while. If he wants to ever really talk to me or meet up I will probably welcome him. Until then, bye 🫡.

AI has entered our startup world like a bull in a china shop—or perhaps more fittingly, like an algorithm in a coding error—leaving a trail of shattered business models and nervous founders in its wake. Some say it's a revolution, others a reckoning; what’s undeniable is that AI is redefining the rules of the startup game. But has it killed innovation, or is it just brutally reorienting it?

### The Great AI Takeover
Picture this: your startup is humming along, AI automation promises to streamline operations, boost efficiency, and save costs. But, wait—next thing you know, an AI tool does what your flagship product does, cheekily asking if it can do it faster, cheaper, and without demanding free coffee on Fridays. How's that for disruption?

**A Shot in the Arm or a Bullet in the Foot?**
For some, AI is a shot of espresso in the startup ecosystem's arm—a sudden jolt that spurs innovation leaps. Machine learning and AI, after all, are unlocking possibilities that were once the preserve of sci-fi. But for others, it's shaping up more like a bullet to the foot, where AI-driven efficiencies threaten entire business models and render startups unable to compete, as if they've been blindsided by their own ingenuity.

**Survival or Extinction?**
Successful startups are those that pivot—just as Blockbuster didn’t, Netflix did. In the AI era, adaptability is non-negotiable. Whether it’s developing complementary AI technology, enhancing product offerings, or carving out niche markets, startups must evolve or risk the unforgiving sting of obsolescence. Think it's hard to pivot a business? Try rebranding a deep learning algorithm that’s bent on taking everyone’s jobs.

**Embrace the Chaos (with Humor)**
We all know AI lacks a sense of humor, but fret not—humans still have that advantage. Startups can harness their imagination and the human touch to do what AI can't—create unique brand stories, connect emotionally, and perhaps, ironically, develop AI that finally understands sarcasm.

So, Redditors, let's hear your tales from the AI trenches. 🤔 Has AI killed your startup—or saved it? Drop your survival stories below.",1,1739754425.0,AiKilledMyStartUp,0,1.0,False
1ir7tws,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ir7tws/85_months_of_af_story/,8.5 months of AF story,"I stopped being alcohol user 8.5 months ago. At the time I quit I was drinking pretty much every day trying to put some days without alcohol in between days I used it and it was exhausting. I hated walking in my favorite park struggling with the idea of driving to the store and getting wine. Then once in the store, trying to limit wine to small paper box. Started feeling awkward going through checkout as I was buying my wine portions every day as I could not trust myself to buy in bulk. Anything that happens during the day would translate in the thought “okay, I am drinking tonight, it is going to be better”. All that. 

Since I stopped, I entered unbearable emotions and feelings- all that I numbed by alcohol. All those I did not learn how to process. This was hard. Those feelings caused severe cravings. First three months were tough. 

Also my dopamine was out of whack and I was overdosing dry fruits. This brought weight gain. After three months I found a will and cut out sugar and late night snacking. Dropped 15 pounds in no time. 

Then was trip to visit my mother and grappling with cloudy issues of childhood. This was awful. In my country of birth alcohol, sugar, chocolate, and caffeine are medications for everything. It took all my will not to drink as I wanted to dissociate terribly. Instead, I abused caffeine. Ate sugar as well. 

After this trip I felt accomplished as I survived it sober, but my nervous system was damaged. I got terribly sick after coming back home and it took me two months to come to the point where I felt somewhat normal again. By this time I almost lost cravings for alcohol. They were hitting maybe once a month. But I was back snacking late at night on dry fruits and drinking lots of coffee. My sleep was trash. 

In the end of December I made a decision to stop sugar again and I quit dry fruits. Started cooking plain meals so I would eat enough during the day. Gosh, cooking never was my thing, I never liked food planning, I never liked eating at work. And here I was doing all of it. But cravings still persisted. This time for sugar. I read a book “Food Junkies” by Vera Tarman and learned that caffeine addiction pulls sugar addiction. 

In January I did unthinkable and quit caffeine. No coffee, no decaf, no chocolate. And this, guys, hit me like a ton of bricks. I underestimated the power of caffeine. I must say quitting caffeine is no picnic. If quitting alcohol made me grapple with cravings, quitting caffeine did not do that, but it literally pulled the carpet from under my feet. Dopamine starvation is real. My vitals are all over the place. I do see glimpses of normal life, I am calmer, do not have heart palpitations anymore. I do not have manic energy. Life feels simpler. But my body is challenged  to adapt. 

In February I realized my blood sugar is jumpy. Even though I wasn’t consuming sugar, in the evening I craved stuff. I tried to satisfy this craving with almonds and cheese and I was overeating it. I knew it was not hunger, but another version of self-soothing addiction-like need. And I could not shake it off. So I decided to measure my blood glucose. I ordered gcm and while I am waiting for it, I started pricking my finger using regular glucometer. I learned that during evenings my blood glucose escalates like crazy BEFORE I snack. After quitting caffeine  I was using caffeine free teas from Celestial Seasonings. I loved Bengal Spice, Tension Tamer, Hot Apple Cinnamon. I think these drinks caused my blood sugar out of whack. So I switched to water only. So far no blood sugar spiking and no cravings. 

To sum it up - once I stepped on sobriety path, it brought to the surface so many other aspects. Now it is not about how I feel physically or how I look, this need for sobriety became a call from within. It is like I do not have a choice.

Hoping to spend no more than $10k in an MCOL area. That includes $1000 in repairs (estimating from inspection and after seller credits), $1000 in new equipment (includes things like tools, a shop vac, weed whacker, etc. my husband has this whole list already), $2000 in flooring (hoping to DIY engineered hardwood floors at $1200, but budgeting in case we want new carpet in the bedrooms or need to pay someone to fix our DIY), $500 in paint (idk how much paint we will need this is a rough cost though, but we will be doing it ourselves and husbands dad used to be a painter anyways), and $5000 in furniture (couch, tv stand, extra chair, kitchen floating island, new rug - hoping to thrift a good coffee table and end tables because I can’t find anything new that we like). And then throwing in $500 for the moving truck, buying lunch for the friends who help us move, and any other miscellaneous things that come up. 

Is this a reasonable budget? Will we most likely over spend? Do you think it’s better to just spend more upfront on specific things than to wait? Do you think some things are better to wait on? After all said and done we’ll have $21k left… but our HVAC and water tank are about to go (20+ years old) so I don’t want to go too far into our savings for up front costs.

We will also be setting aside $1800/mo until I’m due with our first kid in October. Even then we will probably keep saving that until my maternity leave is over. I just get nervous after that point because we will be saving less and just have to hope our emergency fund will pull through (or that we get good raises) ",5,1739754363.0,FirstTimeHomeBuyer,26,0.73,False

Did you hear the one about the AI that walked into a small business and said, ""I'm here to help!""? No, it's not a setup for a punchline about machines running amok—it's the reality of AI revolutionizing industries, one keystroke at a time. Take it from Tim McConnehey of Izzard Ink Publishing, who’s seen AI not as a writer but as the ultimate editor’s assistant.

**Where AI Meets Old-School Publishing**

The world of publishing, steeped in tradition and the romantics of quilled pens and coffee-stained manuscripts, is ripe for a digital awakening. McConnehey isn’t relying on AI to churn out the next Hemingway but to fine-tune the masterpieces human hands start. AI scans the manuscript with its laser sights, flags issues, and even suggests paths to edit. Think of it as a digital coach, whispering sweet suggestions to elevate your prose game.

**Small Business, Big Changes**

Hold onto your bookmarks, folks—58% of small businesses in the U.S. are gearing up to invest in AI. But let's not get it twisted; this isn’t about replacing humans. It’s a partnership, a marriage of silicon and soul.

Janetta King from the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses program is championing resources and training nationwide to keep small businesses AI-ready. This technological tango promises productivity and efficiency, allowing businesses to serve us, the ravenous readers, even better.

My wife and I took an impromptu weekend getaway for Valentine’s Day and decided to check out beacon having never been there before. 

We stayed at the duchess inn and spa and were really impressed with the accommodations. What a cool vibe in the restored factory. The bed was super comfortable. We booked massages the next morning and both of us were extremely impressed with the spa services also. 

Friday night we ate across the river at Blu Pointe. Very modern restaurant. My wife has celiac disease and the restaurant was extremely accommodating with their gluten free options. They even had delicious gluten free bread. Because we booked so late we weren’t able to get a table until 8:45. The food was delicious but we only had entrees and a drink each because it was so late. 

Saturday we went into Fishkill to an amazing Indian restaurant, Gymkhana, with a lunch buffet. One of the best Indian restaurants I’ve been too and Indian is one of our favorite cuisines. We walked Main Street in beacon from end to end in the snow. It’s a great little town and we liked all the restored buildings and shops. 

I will say there were probably too many eateries and not enough stores to shop in. It seemed like every block had a coffee shop, or tea house or bakery. Then there’s a ton of restaurants as well. Some of the shops we were able to shop in were really cool. Some very artsy and eclectic spots. And we loved all the art galleries. 

Our favorite art gallery was Christopher Stella gallery. Some really neat art work in there. 

Dinner at the roundhouse Saturday wasn’t quite as excellent as blu pointe but it was still very good. Not as many gluten free options in general in beacon, which surprised me a bit. 

Overall, we really look forward to heading back in the spring or fall to do some hiking and check out some of the other local towns and villages. Mount beacon, blue mountain especially and get up to the culinary institute for food.

1ir7nt6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1ir7nt6/apartment_number_1_my_story/,Apartment Number 1 - My Story,"Hello everyone, this is the first time I actually post something online but this is something that has been troubling me for quite a while now. 

The story needs a lot of context and by any means is not meant to scare or to shock and I am not trying to gain something, I am genuinely scared and need some advice. I don’t know if anyone will read this but if you find something familiar or recognise any of the “entities” please let me know more. Sorry ahead for any mistakes in writing or things written that don’t make sense. This a very emotional subject for me. 

The story starts when I was about 7 years old ( I am 25 now). My dad was a taxi driver and let’s say allegedly a loan shark. We were living with my grandparents and my dad was fed up of my mom and my grandma always getting into arguments and decided we need to leave. The prices for apartments and houses in Eastern Europe at that time were unaffordable for their income. (My dad a cab driver and my mom unemployed at the time) 
But somehow, because of my dad’s alleged loan business he managed to get his hands on an apartment, that is crucial to my story. 

The apartment was on a communist block, Apartment 1, on a building numbered 6. I will not disclose the name of the road for now. The whole thing was sketchy even in my point of view of that time. Apparently I found out years later that the apartment was lost by a gambler, and because of the circumstances he was in he had to sell it to pay debt to an alleged loan shark (you understand how it goes). 

When we moved there, a series or strange things started happening. And something even today gets my mind running back there and I feel like there’s something that want’s me to go back there or around that place. 

1. THE CRYING WOMAN. 

A week after we moved in that apartment everything was normal, I was happy as a kid to have my own room as opposed to sleep with my dad. 
It was a sunny Saturday around springtime and my mom was in the kitchen and I was playing in the living room watching TV. 

All of the sudden I start hearing a woman crying her heart out and sobbing from the outside. I looked out the window but did not see anybody. My mom came running in the room with a shocked face and asked me if I was alright. I told her yes and asked who’s crying this loud, and when we looked out the window again as we were on ground floor we looked down and there was a woman standing below our window caressing the wall and crying as loud as she could. 

My mom then shouted at her “Lady are you ok, what’s happening?” But she did not respond initially, after a while my mom was considering calling the police, but when she asked her again if she’s okay she raised her head from the ground and told my mom as she stopped crying “You cannot understand, nobody does, you will soon enough.” 
Scared my mom shut the window and went back inside and called my dad who was at work but until she told him what happened the woman went away. 
Strangely as we were on ground floor we had a pretty big line of sight outside but did not see her get up or leave. 

She poped up a couple of times after that and we just concluded that she is crazy and my mom actually filed a police report. We tought that she might be somebody related to the gambler that lost the house and she is mad at us moving there, but upon my dad asking the gambler had no relatives or close friends for that matter. 

She showed up 6 times, with 1 day pause in between since the first appearance. 
The last time she showed up to cry under our window my mom was mad and went outside to argue with her, she wore a grey hoodie and had the hood on. A strange selection of clothes for a lady on the elder side (around 50-60 years old). 
My mom told her to leave and to stop coming to cry here or she will be in trouble with the police. She just looked blank at my mom and got up and left. The only time we saw her getting up to leave. After that she stopped coming and we never saw her again. 

The thing that was a mystery at that time is that we spoke with some neighbours and nobody heard her. A couple who were living above us had their living room window above us and told us they kinda saw somebody fitting our description but never heard the crying. (It was too loud not to reach their window as they were on the first floor and the woman was crying as loud as she could). 
She never showed up again and a police officer came after two weeks and told us they have been patrolling around and found nobody fitting the description or other reports of a crazy lady crying under people’s windows. 

2. THE FAST ENTITY PASSING BY THE WINDOW.


I will call this thing “the fast entity” because I have no idea what it is or how it looked like apart from what I was able to identify at that time. 
Whenever I was just hanging around playing or trying to sleep around the house, sometimes when I was looking in the direction of the window there was something that would move either up or sideways really really fast. I could see it was black, but it was so fast that I could only catch it in the corner of my eye every-time. Like a big bird flying really close to the window at incredible speed. 

I thought it was just my imagination until I had a friend from school over, I was excited that day to show him some new toy and he all of the sudden stopped and asked “Wow, did you see how fast that went by the window?” And I remember how he was so like “Damn that must have been a cool bird or something” as he wasn’t really the smartest tool in the shed but he was funny. I had an eerie feeling on the other end, it did not look like a cool fast bird to me but rather like something getting a glimpse of what I’m doing on a constant. 

The best I can describe it is like three of four basketballs merged together with a cape over them moving at Formula 1 speeds past my window every now and then. 

I actually told my mom and dad about this but they are really skeptical and at that age they probably  thought it was only my imagination.  

3. THE ENTITY THROWING DUST AT THE DOOR. 

One early morning as my dad used to start his shift at around 5:00 he went to start his car a it was really cold that morning (he had an old diesel beat up Fiat) 
He usually let the engine run for a couple of minutes before driving away.  

As he was sitting by his car sipping his coffee, he saw an elderly woman kneeling and leaving something at every door (the entrance of the apartment building had a big see through door) she was wearing a black dress and had a scarf over her head, as he turned away to open the car door she vanished. But luckily another neighbour just got out of the building at that time. My dad started chatting with him and asked him if he saw this woman inside and he told my dad “ Oh must have been the cleaning lady, she usually mops the building but she comes around 9:00 or 10:00, a bit early for her to be here right now”. 

My dad went briefly in the entrance hall of the building and all he could find was dust thrown at every doorstep. (Strange as it was snowing outside and the ground was soaked in snow and mud). 
He just left for work and thought nothing of it. 

4. THE PALE VERSION OF A FRIEND WANTING TO BE LET IN. 

My mom just got a job, and it was time for me to spend some time alone as I got home from school. But I had a cousin older than me and she usually came as I finished school to stay with me until my mom got home from work. I was in the first grade and she was in the ninth grade at that time. I finished school around 12:00 and she usually finished her classes around 13:00 so there was almost an hour that I had to spend alone at home. As my mom finished work around 17:00. 

She had a boyfriend which I really adored at the time, he was the cool guy I looked up to at that time. He was into dirt bikes, bikes in general and all the cool stuff a first grader might find interesting. My cousin usually came together with him and they will play with me until my mom got home. He was always cool dressed, bringing me all sorts of magazines and playing cards (probably to impress my cousin lol). But the thing is I really liked him. 

One day I got home from school and was patiently waiting for my cousin to arrive. I suddenly hear a soft knock on the door and I thought damn it’s pretty early for my cousin to finish school. 
I went to the door and looked through the door visor, and saw my cousin’s boyfriend staying there with a straight posture waiting (also looking strangely pale). 
In excitement I went to get the keys to open the door to let him in. 

As I went to go get the keys I saw my cousin out the window coming in to the entrance of the apartment building. (Our apartment was really close to the entrance as it was the first one) She got home early from school that day and she came straight to me. 

When I opened the door my cousin was there and I let her in and at a glance I saw her boyfriend in the hallway in the same straight position looking pale and waiting outside. As she closed the door I asked her “Isn’t your boyfriend coming in?” She replied looking confused “Umm he isn’t coming today he has a lot of homework” and I thought oh ok he only walked her here and went away. But he was there before her which was strange. 

What would have happened if she did not finish school early that day? Would I have let that entity inside thinking it’s my cousin’s cool boyfriend? 
He was never there that day, but even now I know what I saw was true. 

CONCLUSION & MOTIVE 

There have been a series of other strange things that happened there. We only lived there for like a year and a half but there have been countless strange instances that will take a lot to detail in this post but maybe will make a part 2. From perfectly working water pipes bursting to random scratching sounds there was a lot. We all had a restless feeling just being in that apartment. My father used to work 14-16 hours a day to be able to provide for us as my mom did not earn a whole lot, but when he arrived home tired and feeling like he was going to fall asleep behind the wheel, once home he could not get any rest. My parents sold the apartment because they raised some more money and got a good offer on another bigger apartment 10 kilometres away from the city. 

Now onto why I am reminiscing all this and why I am concerned and writing all this. 
I had a nightmare the past days that seems to be repeating where I wake up on my desk I used to have in that apartment and when I look around I’m in a cemetery with a computer in front of me. Strange, I know. 

But the feeling I constantly have is that I have to go there, I have to see something, I don’t know what. Not in the apartment because I don’t know who lives there now and I don’t want to be the crazy person knocking on their door like hello used to live here haha crazy place you have. 

The thing is, the town we live in is relatively small and I have friends all over and used to drive part time for my dad’s new business for a while when I used to be in college. I always get close to that street but even though it’s convenient to drive on that road to get to another part of the city, I for some reason never do, there’s always something keeping me from going there. Not that I don’t want to but there is always something keeping me. Like a car parked the wrong way, somebody backing up looking for parking blocking the street and I always go around.
Never had friends living on that road, never had a reason to go there after we left even though it’s in kind of a popular area of the city where you can go if you just drive around. 
I had a work colleague who lived pretty close but a couple of buildings away from that road, and we had a little house party at his place and he asked who wants to come with him to the store to get something, and I volunteered and as soon as I got up I had a striking headache ( which I thought was because of the alcohol) and decided I’m too drunk to go. But later on realised If i would have went, we would have went on the road I used to live on to get to the store. 

Did something protect me to go back there? I have this feeling that I should go by that place that I cannot explain. A sort of feeling that in order to fix what I’m feeling and the answers to some of my problems that I’m experiencing are there and I should just go on a walk around that building on that road. 

Now, my question is, am I being deceived? Could something want me there that is not good intentioned or is it the opposite and I have to solve this now that I can? 

And, if I decide to go what measures can I take to protect myself should any of this be real and try to hurt me? I am skeptical when it comes to these things but the feeling build so strong that I’m starting to question my sanity but it’s better to be safe than sorry. 

If anybody reads this and wants more details or specifics will be more than happy to provide them in private or in another part.

1ir7nma,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokunoheroFanfiction/comments/1ir7nma/being_perfectisnt_fun/,Being perfect...isn't fun,"As I already did the version of AFO (Kimikage Shigaraki) now it is All Might's turn

  
Toshinori grew up in an orphanage along with Kimikage.

The two became best friends because they complemented each other very well, while Toshinori was dumb, Kimikage was a genius and while Kimikage was antisocial, Toshinori was his opposite.

Toshinori was not able to enjoy his childhood or adolescence due to being in the resistance that fought against the government and its hunt for Quirk users, which led him to have certain attacks of childishness and immaturity, and he often behaves like a 15-year-old teenager in an adult's body. 

After believing he had killed AFO, he became quite depressed.

Toshinori was like Izuku, he could have easily awakened the quirks of the former OFA users, but due to the depression he suffered and which worsened over the years, his potential was stagnant. 

Toshinori is OFA user number 78.

Clarification: in this universe there were 79 OFA users (Izuku is number 79) no there are not 79 Quirks in the OFA the first 71 users excluding Yoichi were quirkless the 71 users cultivated and molded the OFA better and being easier to use. (this is why this universe is more different than the canon one) 

Toshinori hates and abhors being the number 1 hero because they always forced him to be perfect, he couldn't make a mistake in anything, not even speaking, or with anything this led him to not sleep and being a coffee addict, the HPSC threatened to kick him out because he went out on patrol at hours of the night when he was supposed to be giving interviews.

The HPSC turned Toshinori's job into being a celebrity into being a hero, supposedly to protect him.

The HPSC inflated All Might's image so much that this led to Toshinori having to go to a private psychologist most of the time when he was not being a hero or recovering from the injury caused by AFO. 

Toshinori is not such a friend of Sir Nighteye, their friendship is summarized in a hello and a goodbye, here Nighteye is more of a friend to endeavor than to All Might.

Toshinori is terrible at relationships other than friendships.

Toshinori, despite all his problems, tries to be a good hero and make others smile.

Toshinori let himself be killed by AFO on Kamino, this was because after giving the OFA to Izuku, Toshinori's body no longer responded as well as before. 

Imagine that effect as a car that uses expensive and specific gasoline to function, then you use normal gasoline, and starts to malfunction. Basically, not having the OFA anymore and having the fathoms of it gave Toshinori health problems which in Kamino were no longer bearable, and that is why he let himself be killed by AFO. 

Toshinori, before dying, gave Izuku all the information he could get from the OFA so that he could continue training and perfecting the OFA.

Toshinori hid all the side effects of passing the OFA to Izuku so that no one would worry about him.

Even despite the pain from the side effects, Toshinori continued and remained being a hero despite everything.

1ir7m23,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/1ir7m23/potential_grad_student_seeking_any_and_all_info/,Potential grad student seeking  any and all info,"Howdy. I was recently admitted to the M.A. in Motor Learning and Control program in the biobehavioral sciences department, starting fall 2025. I’m hoping to get some perspective from current students in the same/a similar program. Not looking for any specific answers or to be convinced this program is “worth it”, just really curious about people’s satisfaction with their time here. 

About me:

- I love school. I am genuinely passionate about the field I would be studying and get giddy looking at the curriculum. It is perfectly aligned with my academic interests and past education. 

- Low income, and family has no money. I have not received my financial aid offer yet, they’re supposed to come out later this month. If I don’t get a decent chunk of funding (scholarships, pell grant/other grants, etc.) I won’t be doing the program. 

- I am a Movement Analyst (CLMA) and Somatic Movement Therapist (RSMT), and have been working with clients (mostly rock climbers and dancers) since graduating in 2022. Nobody has any idea what either of those credentials are which is part of why I’m interested in a more mainstream degree. 

- I do not want to be a professor or start a lab. The ivory tower of academia sucks. I care more about jumping through the hoops to gain knowledge, connections, and skills that I can then use to impact “regular” people’s lives. However I do want to write a book, participate in research, and have high level credentials that will give my writing, research, and practice as a movement therapist more respect/credibility. 

- I’m considering going to PT school instead of doing this program. Has anyone done both? Or chosen either one and regretted it? 

- Has anyone successfully commuted from Brooklyn while in grad school? I have family there and could potentially save a shit ton of money on housing, but don’t want to make my life miserable. 

- I’ll be in the city this week, can I just walk on to TC campus? It seems like Columbia campus is still closed, but the TC campus is open to visitors? Anything I should check out? Anyone wanna grab coffee and give me the inside scoop on what it’s like to be a curious, driven, broke ass human in grad school at Columbia? 

Gimme whatever you got!

I was prescribed addy XR 10mg: 


Day 1- was really rough. I felt like my body was relaxed but my mind and my heart was going a million miles an hour. My blood pressure was elevated. This lasted into the middle of the night.

Day 2- I dreaded taking it again but wanted to give it a genuine try. I made sure to eat with a protein heavy breakfast (I do keto so this was easy), and I decided to forgo my coffee. It was a
180. My entire body felt relaxed but I didn't want to get out of the bed lol.

Day 3- Same routine and experiment but this time I was able to get moving around and enjoy the day. When I felt a mid day crash I had 1/2 cup coffee. This made me more relaxed and my mind stayed race-free.

Day 4- Same routine, I felt much more motivated today and did some serious cleaning, and I was able to complete mundane tasks I usually put off.
However, towards the night during the crash, I feel really irritable, almost like I wanted to scream and punch some pillows. Of course, I'd never do this. I made sure to avoid other family members in the house because I didn't want them to see me in an irritated state. I laid in bed and distracted myself with a movie and to finish riding out the crash. I made sure to eat a couple snack in the duration. I feel fine now.


Is this feeling of 'rage' normal? I'm worried about taking it tomorrow. Logically, my mind links it to the dopamine crash. Or I just started my period if that matters? Any advice or how to ensure this doesn't continue to happen?

1ir7kto,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ir7kto/going_on_date_5_with_dream_man_but_i_am_getting/,Going on date 5 with ‘dream man’ but I am getting bad vibes,"I (26f) have been seeing a guy (24m) who is my ideal type. He's intelligent, has a good career, and is physically the 'type' that I've always fantasized about. But the idea of going on a 5th date is making me feel anxious and hesitant. I've never been in any sort of romantic relationship before, only a few random dates over the years. I am very happily single, and when I was in high school I seriously considered becoming a nun (though I'm not particularly religious anymore). I met this guy through my job and felt we had an instant connection. The first date we met for coffee and talked 3 hours. Turns out we are very similar, both in personality, values, and family backgrounds. I genuinely felt like he could be the 'one' as I never met any guy I liked as much as him. My only hold ups were a few sexual comments that made me uncomfortable but I brushed off. Date 2 was nice, he paid for dinner and we went ice skating. He kept asking if I wanted to go back to his place and I declined, as I did not want to lead him on in anyway. Date 3 went ok, but I started to feel like we ran out of things to talk about at that point. That night he bagan to make an effort in touching my arms, shoulders, etc. Nothing I found inappropriate, but I don't like being touched in general. Again I was invited back to his place and I declined. Date 3 we went out of town, and this time the touching ramped up way past my comfort levels. I felt trapped in the car and he kept touching my thighs, putting his arm around me, etc. I did not say anything as I felt trapped and I was unsure how I felt about the situation. Again came some comments about how pretty I was and a few sexual innuendos. I am a very sarcastic person so I simply played them off as jokes and did my best to move away from the touching when I could. Come valentines day I made an insane amount of goodies for work and some friends so I decided to take some over to him. When I got out of the car he came running out of his apartment, picked me up and spun me around in the air, then went in for a kiss which I dodged but he ended up landing on my neck. This was in the parking lot in front of strangers and not only was the embarrassment mortifying, but I felt extremely angry that I've only known this guy a few weeks and he felt entitled to kiss me by catching me off guard. He then gave me a bouquet of flowers (actually very beautiful) and a whole speech about how much he likes me, how pretty I am, and how he wants to spend more time with me etc. However I could not get over him grabbing me and trying to kiss me moments before. It still makes me angry to think about it now. He then asked if I wanted to come in but noticed my car was still running as I only intended to drop off his baked goodies then continue my deliveries. I've talked to my friends about this and they all think it was 'very sweet' if misguided, and I should 'give him a chance'. But, if I'm not into his physical advances, I've actively moved away from them, and shown no interest in reciprocating, Shouldn't he be picking up on that? He asked me out again next weekend and I told him I only want to get coffee. I'm seriously considering breaking off contact altogether, but my friends think I should tell him he's making me uncomfortable, that I want to slow things down, and see how he responds. But my gut is telling me something is off. He doesn't seem to have any friends, and he is always wanting to do an 'activity' for our dates when I would be happy to just sit and talk to get to know him. He complains about my home town all the time, which granted he comes from a big city and I have lived in many other places so I get why the city I live in feels pretty dull in comparison, but I hate the constant negativity he feels towards it. Everytime we talk he only brings up politics which, while we have similar opinions, I don't want to constantly talk about. On top of all this I'm going through a very tough situation with a close family members health and issues at work, and since I've never been in a relationship before I don't know how much of my personal frustrations I'm projecting onto him. Even though I'm not overwhelmingly religious I still want to wait and get to know someone before becoming intimate (also I just hate being touched by other people in general), and he also grew up hardcore catholic; in fact I would make the argument that currently he is more religious than I am. So him trying to inniciate anything intimate so early seems hypocritical tbh.

TLDR; am I in the wrong for not wanting to continue dating 'my ideal type' for being way too touchy and it's making me uncomfortable?",0,1739753672.0,dating_advice,5,0.5,False

I (22m) who live in London meet this girl (24f) from a university program who lived in Toronto, she was in the London for month and we meet and we really liked each others, we didn’t expect anything was gonna happen between us because we both didn’t believe in long distance relationships, However on her last day in London we went on a date and we kissed, we both decided to make a decision to try long distance relationship and the first few months were perfect and we both put so much effort in our relationship we were trying to meet at least 1 time a month or at least every 2 month, sometimes she would come to the London and sometimes I will go to Toronto. 

We had few arguments regarding our boundaries where I told her I did not want her to look between my close friends chat, this because my close friends (2 close friends) would tell me their private things and sometimes I will talk one of them about her with one of my close friend  regarding how hard is long distance and sometimes asking him about some arguments we had, my friends is older then me and I see him as a bigger brother and he always helped me in the past, besides my close friend chat I never had any issue with her looking at my phone.

Recently I went to see her again in Toronto I took time off from my part time job and time off from my university since I am still a student. I was meant to be there for 3 weeks and I was really excited about it because I haven’t seen her in 2 months. After 3 days I was staying at her place I woke up and as usual I just went to take a shower and got ready, it was Valentines Days and it was also our 4 month anniversary. 

She woke up she I saw her acting normal and at some point she started acting weird and that made me very anxious because she was keep ignoring me and I sense something was not ok, at some point we both sat down and she just  told me to leave her apartment now and to book my ticket and to go back to London, as soon I hear those words I was in shock because her eyes were so cold, I keep asking her but what did I do, or if I did anything wrong that made her so upset but she didn’t want to talk, she was just telling me to to get out from her appointment and she was keep raising her voice, since it was her place I had no choice, I packed all my stuff in 10 min and I just left her place.

I went outside it was -7 degrees and the snow was 40/50 cm high and I was outside with my massive and heavy suitcase and hand carry-on. She texted me saying it was over between us because when I was sleeping during the night she went in my phone, she started reading everything, at some point she saw a part in that chat with my close friend where I was joking regarding of my old crush from I was 11/12 years old where I typed “she’s the love of my life” but it was all as a joke it was nothing serious, and she told me she saw the chat between some girls on my instagram, the only chat I had with female, were with one of my old collogue who wanted to join back in my company where I worked  and she was asking me if I can speak with the manger and the other chat was one of my female friends where I just wished her happy birthday and she replayed with a thank you with a heart, my friend replay like that to everyone. 

I was in the freezing cold and I didn’t knew what to do, I didn’t knew anyone in Toronto, it was so cold and I had a heavy bag with me, I badly was able to text her and I was trying to make her understand it was just a big mistake and she miss understood everything, she was keep telling me no metter what I say things between me and her were over and she would not listing to me, I called my friend from London explain to him what happen  and asked him to book my ticket from there it was cheaper for me, I was walking in the snow looking for a coffe shop where to sit and send the money to my friend so I could be warm at least, when I found the coffee place I booked my ticket and I book my uber to the airport.

When I sat down in the uber I told her what she did to me was disgusting she kicked me out in a country that I don’t know in the cold and in the snow and she didn’t even listing or try to listen to me, and all she did was replaying with an heart, maybe to make me angry ? I got at the airport 9 hours early and I was still shocked of what happen and out of no where she she started sending me our pic telling me “I’ll guess I don’t regret everything but I made the right choice” my flight even got delayed and I missed my connection flight to London and I had to spend a night in a different country and I just made it at home today after 2 days of traveling, I’m stilling shocked of what happen and I don’t know how to fell about everything I still can’t believe was she did to me.

I have 5 days to spend around Match/April. I'll be going with a friend. I am more of a adventure type of guy so I like the beaches, forest, hikes, waterfalls (basically anything with adrenaline)



Question- Is everything accessible by [car](https://www.tripadvisor.com/RentalCars-g291982-Costa_Rica.html)? Is there other options since I tend to get [car](https://www.tripadvisor.com/RentalCars-g291982-Costa_Rica.html) sick? Buses? Trains?



Is the area mostly english speaking? Like if I am off the beaten path, will I have trouble getting around?



How safe is the country overall?

I heard the mosquitos here can be bad, also other foreign insects, so will I get sick? is there a chance I can infected? How can I prevent it? How can I be healthy and safe and enjoy my short time there from the states. I want to be an explorer and I can walk for long hours, but I also want to arrive home safe without any illness and issues with gangs/etc. I do not have any health insurance even here in the states.

Planning to maybe visit El Pilón, Lagarta Lodge, maybe a coffee tour, see waterfalls/Swim/Surf? [Playa](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g309274-d555759-Reviews-Playa_Manuel_Antonio-Manuel_Antonio_Quepos_Province_of_Puntarenas.html) Coyote, fishing village experience, volcanos, seeing wildlife, etc. I am also not opposed to guided tours but it is only 5 days and I want to make the most of it.



I probably won't stay around the [San Jose](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g309293-San_Jose_San_Jose_Metro_Province_of_San_Jose-Vacations.html) area other than coming in from the airport.

As for accommodations I don't need a resort like experience but what are you suggestions for that? My biggest concern is health coming back so I want to drink clean water and eat good food and don't want to compromise on that so is it recommended against hostels, or cheaper lodging?

budgetwise for the [plane](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Flights-g291982-Costa_Rica-Cheap_Discount_Airfares.html), hotels, experiences, and food we are looking around 3000$ usd for 2 people. Is this realstic?",1,1739753615.0,CostaRicaTravel,0,1.0,False

1ir7hxq,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXPreppers/comments/1ir7hxq/prepping_advice_for_intermediates/,Prepping Advice for intermediates.....,"Basic prepping is the ability to take care of your family (ie, in a disaster) until someone comes to rescue you. With a garden and a pantry, people should try for 3-12 months of food security, and a solid plan for (accessing or purifying) clean drinking water/medical supplies. 

Intermediate prepping is the ability to sustain yourself for 1-2 years. The USA is heading for war. Either with Canada, or Mexico, or just a good old fashioned American orgy of violence. It's coming. Sure as shit. Do you have a plan, if there's no Red Cross, FEMA, or humanitarian groups to assist? It's scary, but no-one has the luxury of ignoring reality anymore. 

Critical issue: Can you resupply yourself/family/community? It's very difficult without preparation and a strategy. Consider a few things as you make your plans:

1. In war zones, almost ALL trade stops. Ships from South America (ie, all coffee/cocoa) won't want to get sunk, truckers won't want to get hijacked/IED'd on the highways, red states won't want to trade with blue...etc.

2. IF there is any fuel, it will be prioritized by the military and critical industry. Civilian vehicles will not be usable for long. It's difficult to imagine this complete loss of freedom and mobility, but, people must carefully choose their location of safety. Roads will be dangerous with checkpoints, no gas stations working, no grocery stores, no banks....

2. The rich will hoard all the resources in their warehouses. They will still have limited trade for their luxuries. THIS is what you need to access. 

3. In a civil war, it's both martial law -- and a complete state of unlawfulness. Basically, there are no rules that aren't enforced by a gun. Police aren't enforcing most laws, and all the regulations are now unknowable....There is a (ahem) certain freedom that exists in war zones, once you grasp the potential. 

There are few good options for survival in war zones. But here are the traditional ones (and yes, some strategies are advanced)

1. Join an army or militia. 

2. Become a refugee in an emergency camp (if any exist, and if you can get there).

3. Become a smuggler/spy/fixer (advanced).

4. Produce a cash crop. These include marijuana growing, gold/mineral mining, or running a still for alcohol/gasoline production. Food production is possible for farmers; extremely difficult for newbies.

5. In cities, you can hide and scavenging/steal for resources. 

6. Sell your skills. Fixing (the Tinker) will be the most valuable. Small fixing tools are extremely valuable, and all mechanics will be welcome at any fire. Are you a scavenger? Good at growing? Can you knit? Become useful in something, and people will need you. If you got no skill, be the hardest working motherfucker in the group. First to wake, last to sleep. 

For all of these options, you need to remember, it's location that matters. Where you hole-up needs to work with your medium-term strategy. Do you have mobility, or do you want to hide and move at night? Will there be enough to scavenge? Do I live near farms where I might trade for food? Does your strategy require other people to succeed? Do you know the people with the right mix of skills to succeed?

So, network early. Find a rural location near water. Store seeds. Pre-prep your rural/city hide-away with extra supplies. Tools/soldering guns/solar panel repairs will be valuable. 

 Hope this helps with your planning. ",6,1739753428.0,TwoXPreppers,0,1.0,False

My best friend took me out to a bar, had a bunch of drinks was Pretty drunk, what i think the issue is, is that near the end of the night i took 2 shots back to back (i had reasons other than being a drunk). some time passes, i feel drunk, but fine, we get into the car to go home, drunk but fine, i lay down in the back seat, drunk but fine, 45-ish minute drive home, drunk but fine could have easily fallen asleep but we were all having conversations and laughing. get out of the car, drunk but fine, get home, go upstairs lay down in bed... extremely nauseous, go to the bathroom, vomit chunks a few times (we had pizza at 7-ish, not sure if that would have been in my stomach still, it was about 12-12:30 at this point) once I'm empty I'm no longer nauseous and i go to sleep. wake up in the morning, terrible hangover as expected(nauseous, don't wanna move, general malaise, headache), get some coffee and a small breakfast + 2 Advil in me as its all i could stomach, and by 12 my stomach is still upset but I'm overall decent food isn't appetizing but drinks are (not surprising due to dehydration)

Now generally speaking for the last 2 days(the night at the bar was Thursday) started noticing i really didn't want to eat food, but i couldn't down my drinks fast enough. I'd take a few bites and be done. really craving milk too, not because I'm thinking it will help anything but just a craving and my kidneys have been hurting, today i grabbed some Pedialyte and ensure from the store incase i couldn't eat a lot, yesterday i was drinking a lot of fluids too

with all the extra fluid intake I'm going to the bathroom consistently, and urine isn't totally clear but still light Dr. google said it might be Gastritis for the stomach which may also cause some kidney pain due to inflammation or possible straight Acute Kidney injury. which I'm hoping as long as i fix the ""underlying issues"" (i don't drink but on rare occasions and I'm increasing fluid intake) and avoid acidic foods both of my issues will go away, as i write this my stomach is already feeling a bit better and i ate noodles with no issue",1,1739753299.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
