I‚Äôm new to pour over since my auto drip machine just crapped out on me and I want better tasting coffee. 

 I leave for work at 4am and start my day off with a 32 oz yeti of black coffee. I‚Äôve been trying 750-800g water to 40-50g of a medium grind and getting results that are decent but cannot seam to keep consistency. I‚Äôd like to be able to brew two batches in the morning. One for my morning serving and another for my thermos for after lunch. 

All the write ups and video tutorials I have seen seem to be for small batches. Is that the only way to make repeatable good coffee? Or does anyone have any tips for how I can make large brews in one shot?",1,1736273442.0,pourover,0,1.0,False
1hvxrph,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hvxrph/fellow_opus_1_year_review/,Fellow Opus - 1 year Review,"TL:DR I hate this thing and I need something else.

The outer burr failed 3 months in and I was needing to be on the 50% setting to get useable espresso grinds. I contacted Fellow and they sent me a new outer burr. It worked for about another 3 months and it happened again and I had to go through the same process.

The retention was great for a little bit. The anti-static feature was doing exactly as described and I'd put 18g in and get 18g out. I did the regular cleaning as recommend. Then the summer hit and humidity went up. I've cleaned it as deep as I can without warranty-voiding level of disassembling it. I bought a bellows hoping that would help, it didn't. The anti static doesn't seem to work at all anymore. I put 18g in and unless I beat the crap out of the thing I'll only get \~14g out. I need to literally smack it and tap the entire machine on the counter to get the rest out.

I contacted fellow about this and they wanted me to send my machine back and they would send me a replacement, meaning no coffee for a month. That wasn't an option as a new parent.

At this point I'm just done with fellow. It's like they were made for the hype train reviews on youtube but only lasted long enough for return windows to close. I wish I would have put my $250 towards something better.",1,1736273431.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

My GF (23f) started her birthday with breakfast in bed, and being given about 10 wrapped presents and a bunch of cards. 

She kicked them off the bed and threw her breakfast mug of coffee at me, hitting my head. Saying it was not enough. I tried to apologise but then she started stamping on the presents and kicked one out the room, hitting our cat. 

I tried to check on Buggeles, but that just awoke more fury in my GF, by not being giving my full attention while I had failed to correct my birthday failings. She came out, punched me in the balls and as I bent over in pain. Rammed my face into the cat litter tray and grinded my face against the poop, pee and grit. 

I tried to smile after and say sorry now we are even in a jokey way. But no I was dumb, of course it was not enough. She demanded I send her all my savings so she could make up for my incompetence and buy herself something to make her happy. I did this, even though it was 1 years savings. But I guess it was my fault and I should have know better.

While she is shopping online I clean my face and then clear away the trashed presents and tidy up, but the noise of the crushed wrapping paper being pushed into the recycling bin irratates her. She comes into the kitchen and stabs me, then punches me over. At least I was not near the cat litter tray this time. 

While bleeding she tells me I'm a terrible human being, and kicks Buggeles five feet in the air into the door on her way out. I had no idea how badly I had failed her that day to warrant such actions.  

AIO for thinking 10 presents was enough, and not making the day more special in the first 30 minutes? Should I have not checked on Buggeles? Maybe I should have have waited till she had a shower before clearing up the crushed presents so it would not have disturbed the online shopping? ",1,1736273178.0,AmIOverreacting,3,1.0,False

1hvxmtj,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiehackers/comments/1hvxmtj/my_product_just_hit_its_first_200/,My Product Just Hit Its First $200! üéâ,"Hey Reddit,

I can't believe it ‚Äì my SaaS product just secured its FIRST $100 subscription, and I'm beyond excited! üåï

**A Bit of Background**

I started this journey with just an idea ‚Äì a small, scrappy prototype built during late nights, fueled by endless coffee (and a few mental breakdowns üòÖ). Honestly, I had my doubts. Who would care about my product? Who would actually pay for it?

But last night, as I was winding down, I got the notification: ""You've received a payment of $100."" It took a moment to sink in, and then it hit me hard.

**What My Product Does**

It's a dashboard tool that connects and displays data from multiple sources like Google Analytics and Search Console in one convenient place. No more switching tabs or drowning in data ‚Äì everything‚Äôs organized, making it easy to track performance and make informed decisions with less hassle.

It‚Äôs designed for small businesses, marketers, and anyone seeking a simpler way to monitor online performance. And clearly, there‚Äôs at least one person who found enough value in it to subscribe!

**Why This Means So Much**

I‚Äôm not some big startup founder with investors backing me. There‚Äôs no fancy office or large team ‚Äì just me, working daily, figuring things out as I go. This $100 is more than just money; it‚Äôs validation. It shows that someone out there saw value in what I‚Äôve built and decided to pay for it.

**What‚Äôs Next?**

For me, this is just the beginning. Now that I know people are willing to pay, I‚Äôm focused on pushing forward. More features, more marketing, and hopefully more subscriptions! Let‚Äôs see where this journey takes me.

Thanks for reading! If you‚Äôre working on your own project, let‚Äôs hear about it in the comments ‚Äì let‚Äôs motivate each other. üöÄ

We've been dating for 3 years for reference. He wants me to effectively be a secretary - he actually used the word ""executive secretary"" today to describe how he wants me to act. I'm supposed to: fetch him coffee, make him several meals a day, organize his Google drive, create company Christmas cards, redo his company graphics when he literally hires a graphics guy, update his website when he literally hires someone to do that, update the website for his hobby that he runs, and obviously not interrupt him at any point during this.

So I'm supposed to read his mind on top of all of this because I have no idea what he wants for all of these things. His suggestion? I just make several versions of everything so he can pick... So do four times the amount of work. All the while, he wants to live ""like he's on a business trip,"" and he can't be there for me emotionally or physically.

Anyway! I've put my foot down recently because of how *difficult* he is to work with. I've helped him a lot and realized I couldn't keep that up along side my full time job (and my traumatic brain injury). This last year I've pulled away from constantly helping. He expects a lot of labour and it only causes fights because I ""can't do it right"" or he will 100% refuse to learn how to do it himself - we're in totally different fields and I'll admit I know nothing about his business. He's also so scattered that if I do have free time to help and offer, it's only 6 hours later that he's going to give me something (which he never fully explains) and by then, I don't have hours to sit down and help. Another problem is that he just keeps piling on more and more work, expecting me to pick up the slack. I can barely take care of myself and my house chores at this point because of how much he -expects- demands.

I explain this to him and he calls me selfish. I'm not a team player, I'm too tit for tat, etc. I'm going crazy. He's told me that I don't deserve any further commitment unless I prove I'm a team player by literally doing his job for him.

I don't know how to get him to understand my perspective. Also, I get that partners help one another out, but isn't this a little beyond that? He seems to feel *entitled* to my labor. ",0,1736272714.0,relationship_advice,16,0.33,False

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

I have a [bromine floater](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JZH5QWD?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) that I filled up with tablets (8?), but set the opening down pretty narrow, like 3 rotations from fully closed before I left.

For reference, [this is what the floater is usually set to when we're home, with 2-3 tablets](https://i.imgur.com/vofX4Qm.jpeg).  That typically keeps the PPM between 1.5-3ppm for the bromine.  It's taken a lot of trial and error to dial it in.  

Before we left, the bromine was at 2.5ppm prior to shocking it.  When I tested it on Sunday evening after we returned, and with the water back up to 96F, it was at **19ppm**! 

I'm realizing that the number of tablets in the floater seems far more important to level maintenance than the size of the opening.  Any guidance on how to be more scientific on bromine usage and calibrating the floater?  I've had it spike to >15ppm three times since I went to bromine in early December.  

Obviously, there's a ton of variables here.  We usually use the tub 3-4 times week, just two of us, and we usually rinse before we use it and use special mild laundry detergent, hand-wash and then excessively rinse our bathing suites (when we use our suites, which is rare:) ).

**Second issue (TA):** 

When I got home, on Sunday morning I set the thermostat to 101F.  Around 5:00pm I tested the water after running the jets for 30 min (we were around 96F by then):
    
    
    pH: 7.2     
    TA: 70ppm (probably somewhere between 60-70 based on my Taylor kit results).  


I looked up the table for increasing TA w/baking soda and added 21g (.9oz = 25g for 400ga, my tub is 325, so 25g x 0.8125 = ~21g) to the tub, hoping to bump the TA up by ~10ppm. I am a ~~drug addict~~ coffee enthusiast and have a pour-over setup, so I have good scales that can accurately measure by the gram, and that's what I use for all my water balancing, because fuck volumetric measurements.

I added the baking soda on Sunday evening. Tub runs an auto-clean every night at 1:00am, and on Monday I opened the tub to let sunlight work on the bromine and ran the jets for an hour (I'm scared for my power bill this month).  

Then I tested the tub last night to see where TA and pH were at (101F by now).

    Bromine: 11ppm (yay!)
    pH: 7.7 - ehh
    TA: 320 - WTF?!
    
Obviously, I assumed I messed up the test. I washed everything container I was using, dried them and got new water out of the tub (with the jets running) and retested and got identical results.  Had my wife test, to make sure I wasn't hallucinating and she got the same test (both using the 25ml and 10ml test method for TA)

WTF? 

Decided to go to bed and research options.  Today I reopened it a few hours ago since it's sunny out.  Ran the jets for 30 min and I just tested again 15 minutes ago:

    Bromine: 5ppm (yay!)
    pH 7.6
    TA: 80-90 - WTF?!
    
What am I missing here?  I was certain it was contamination or methodology, but the wife and I both got the same results and I took great care to eliminate contamination.

Anyone have any ideas or clue as to what would cause the TA to bounce around like that?",1,1736272548.0,hottub,1,1.0,False

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

In 2021 I met a educated and working professional 'M52' who is a regular decent guy. We went on three dates and I noted three distinct traits. One-- he makes almost no eye contact, while he will participate in text messaging---It feels very evasive with no definite answers and he uses extremely congenial language with few questions--- that shuts down conversation. Third-- I felt that I was chasing him down to get a time and date for activities, and that I was repeatedly texting trying to create conversation.  I really liked this fella... I thought he was a great human, I was intrigued by his profession and very attracted to him and his intelligence. But ultimately he just slipped away and did not continue text conversation. 
December of 2024 he shows back up on bumble and had super swiped me! His profile now stated that he wanted a long-term monogamous relationship. He was enthusiastic in messaging frequency and positive language, and I let him know he was still in my phone and I wanted to text directly. I let him know that I was excited that he had come back around and it felt serendipitous. Our texting was consistent daily, but I started to note that it felt like he was evasive or he shut conversation down--using language that did not allow for follow-up sentences and he rarely asked any questions... Definitely never rude, definitely never curt ... more in an awkward failure to engage in conversation way.  
I will say this individual has a great deal of social media and I have viewed it, and on it he is smiling, warm, and incredibly intelligent. I would really like to get to know that man. (He works from home and only interacts digitally. So I realized that might be a comfort zone thing. And there's a huge difference between talking at people about a subject, versus interpersonal back and forth conversation.)
We are one month in to texting again, repeatedly I have asked to set up a date, and he has responded that he would like to see me several times. He took a one week trip over the holiday and I just don't feel that there's any effort from him now. I feel like I'm chasing him down. I feel like I want something and I'm trying to use very direct and open language.... I feel that his delayed text messaging, and his lack of forward movement has made me - a person that's very secure start to feel anxious, with the whole intermittent feedback thing. 
My question is..... I'm wondering if the fella is truly not dating savvy, I'm wondering if he might be on the spectrum. I truly would love to date him again and not just awkward coffee dates, I'd like to know the guy that's so smart, that laughs and smiles, and I don't know how to get him to engage with me that way. 

Should I just let him drift it off? Is it annoying to send a text message every 2 days? I've already repeatedly asked his schedule and to see if we can set something up......
I don't feel that he's a player, I don't understand how he cannot have any follow-through when he was so excited to make contact again. 
 
If I was responding to any of my girlfriends in this situation I would tell them to cut him loose, that It is not too much to have clear and direct conversation and forward movement. 

I have the capacity to have the compassion and empathy to interact with people that might be on the spectrum, or men that are older confirmed bachelors, or people that are not dating savvy...

Can I have some people chime in and let me know what he may be thinking, and if I should pursue this, how much is too much?",1,1736272494.0,AITA_Relationships,0,1.0,False

# A Bit of Background:

* I‚Äôm a big coffee enthusiast and have been into pour-over methods like the V60 and Aeropress for a couple of years now.
* Over the holidays, I ended up with more coffee than I could store (no freezer space left) and a 500g bag of beans that was already ‚Äúmeh‚Äù when fresh‚Äîand worse now that it‚Äôs a bit older.
* I hate wasting beans, so I figured: why not get creative?

# The Experiment:

A few days ago, while making my usual V60 brew (Hoffman‚Äôs one-mug method), I had a random idea: *What if I add some fruity tea to the recipe?* In the worst case, it couldn‚Äôt make these beans any worse, right?

I added about **1.5g of cranberry rooibos tea** to the grounds at the start of the brew and proceeded as usual.

# The Result:

It was **amazing!** The cup was bright, and the natural sweetness from the tea balanced out the harsher notes of the coffee. It wasn‚Äôt overwhelmingly tea-like; it still felt like a solid cup of coffee, just with a fun twist.

Since then, I‚Äôve been brewing the coffee like this regularly I will experiment with more teas. So far, it‚Äôs been a game-changer for these beans.

# Curious to Know:

Has anyone else tried adding tea to their coffee? What was your experience like?

**P.S.** I know there are other ways to deal with older beans‚Äîcold brew, freezing, etc. This was just a spur-of-the-moment experiment, and I‚Äôm really happy with how it turned out!",7,1736272398.0,pourover,8,1.0,False

Taller than average, with a beard and tattoos. If those sparks fly, physical looks fade, but it's the heart and mind that should be the focus. I do have a child from a previous marriage. It is a good situation, no drama llamas over here.

   I used to have a massive daily caffeine intake.  One day back in august I had a coffee that morning, an energy drink at noon, and multiple espresso martinis that evening. After my 6th espresso martini it suddenly became difficult to breathe, my chest painfully tightened up and my body became shaky. I felt like I had to throw up all the time and had to walk around a bunch and drink a bunch of water just to feel better. My mom told me I had too much caffeine and that I should just rest and left the caffeine process out of my body and I‚Äôll feel better. 

   The next morning I woke up feeling shaky and weak and my entire body felt sore. That feeling never fully went away. 

  It‚Äôs now January. Some days are really good where I feel energized and like my normal self. But every two days on average I feel really weak and my heart hurts. If I don‚Äôt get enough sleep my chest feels awful and I feel weak, if I work out two days in a row or get really stressed it‚Äôs the same feeling. I‚Äôve had moments where I feel like I‚Äôm about to collapse or have my heart give out and I‚Äôm obviously concerned to say the least.

Posting my interpretation below:

>\[Verse 1\]  
Baby, come look in the mirror  
My hair's turnin' gray  
You laughed till you tickled pink  
Still wish it was that way  
I put that ring on your finger  
Seven years ago tonight  
I'm pretty good now at messin' up  
But I know I got one thing right

So the singers have been married seven years, and used to be madly in love, but now are on the rocks (""Still wish it was that way"")

>\[Chorus\]  
Are you gonna hold on, baby?  
Are we gonna make it last?  
How are we gonna see forever  
When you always run away so fast?  
Well, I ain't got much money  
But I got a heart like an Oldsmobile  
I feel like a fool for ya, honey  
And I guess I always will

The man wants to make the marriage work, but the woman wants to run away when things get tough

>\[Verse 2\]  
We got married in the summer  
Beneath the sky of stars  
I sing that Wildwood Flower  
And your daddy, he played guitar  
And I found our wedding pictures  
As I was packin' up today  
You said we look so happy  
But I guess happy don't always stay

The woman is no longer happy, but was reminiscing about the good times when she came across their wedding album while packing to leave him.

>\[Bridge\]  
Been a long cold winter  
In the Carolina pines  
I showed up in that big warm coat  
That used to be mine  
Come on let's get coffee  
Sorry it's such a mess  
Well, how long do you want to stay?  
Forever, I guess?

The woman went away to live in the Carolina pines for the winter, but eventually came back to her husband (wearing his coat) and they went to get coffee to hash things out. She decides she wants to stay with him forever despite the hard times.

\---------------------------

Overall I think it's a sweet story of a couple that's been married for a few years, the woman decides to leave, but ultimately comes back and decides to make it work despite their issues. My main hesitation with this is that Sierra and the male singer both sing the chorus, which makes it seem like they're both accusing the other of running away too fast, but also both saying they have a ""heart like an oldsmobile"", which I take to mean they'll never stop loving each other.",2,1736272231.0,SierraFerrell,0,1.0,False

Within the last 5 years I have become extremely alcohol intolerant, to the point of being able to get sick from a Heineken 0.0 (which online says it can have up to 0.01-0.03%). 

I was at a farmer's market this year and there was a kombucha saleswoman who swore to me they brewed their stuff without alcohol, I had a VERY small sample SIP and started to have symptoms. 

My symptoms: it feels like I'm going to die.  My entire system feels like it's being attacked, my stomach is in pain, I'm nauseous, and it feels like someone is sedating me with drugs, and I can't keep my eyes open, I get gassy, and need to be in fetal position.   It got steadily worse within a span of 1 year.  I had 3 modellos at my buddies, and started throwing up everything outside, and I wasn't even buzzed.  The sedating feeling is extremely strong and the first time I had a really bad reaction (drank 1/3rd of a truly) it felt like I was going in and out of consciousness. My mental state and decision making were also affected, I drove home 40min through traffic on a major highway like that because I was uncomfortable and scared.  Probably the worst decision I could have made but I got home safe somehow.

This sensitivity is extending to other things now such as nicotine and caffeine.  I cannot have even a sip of red bull without feeling like I just had 3 full cups of coffee. 

I don't smoke nicotine regularly, but every year my buddy and I get together and scooter around and enjoy some cigarillos, this year I was unable to even get through a quarter of mine without feeling a little bit ill.  They were the same kind we always get.  These things are very intense for the very small amount I'm taking in.  

I went to one doctor and they essentially told me that it would cost too much money and time to figure out what's going on, to just tell me to stay away from those things.  

I haven't had any alcohol in 4+ years now, only limited to one sip of beer I accidentally swallowed instead of spit out at a party, (which yes I missed the rest of the party in fetal position in my room, over an amount of beer that basically just wet my tongue) 

I'm a god damn human litmus paper for alcohol. I can't even have NyQuil. 

Also, daily marijuana use 9+years. 

Anyone have any sort of insight as to what could be going on?  ",0,1736272062.0,AskDocs,1,0.5,False

","This is going to be a really long one, and I apologize in advance, but I really just need someone to talk to about this. Feel free to skip any context you don't want to read, I separated them into paragraphs. THERE WILL BE A TLDR. 

Before we start, please try not to be too critical, because I really am trying my very, very best to manage everyone's emotions and balance everyone's needs and be fair to the very best of my abilities, but I'm just drowning over here and don't know what to do. I'm also autistic so nonverbal cues are sometimes hard, so I could be misreading conversations by taking them at face value or focusing on unimportant details, I don't know.

Also lots of trigger warnings for abuse.

-I'm also using a throwaway turned anonymous account ((I've been using this throwaway for awhile) because obviously I don't want to share this with everyone in my life who might figure out who I am/some of the people at work have found my reddit before so yeah). This is honestly still so super detailed that anyone who knows me might still be able to figure out it's me even with no additional context. *Sigh*

Some context about my own limited previous experiences with polyamory, skip this paragraph if you don't want the context: I am personally new to polyamory. I tried being in an open relationship awhile back and it just didn't work because of communication and safer sex reasons, and at one point I did do a throuple, but that also ended in a dumpster fire, and I'm aware those don't usually ""count"" as typical polyamory, so I'm going to say I'm new to poly. I do have several close friends (and my boss) who are in various differed forms of polyamory/polycules, and I am somewhat familiar with how things typically work, but my friends are dealing with a lot of personal stuff and I don't feel comfy going to my boss about this specific thing, despite him knowing I started being poly because I wanted basic advice at first. 

Key:
New Partner: M
Original Mono Partner: C

Some context about my previous history with my new partner (M): Putting this first because I knew my new partner first, years ago. Please note, this probably won't paint me in the best light because this wasn't exactly ethical and was definitely emotional cheating, whether or not I was in an extremely controlling and abusive (physical, s3xu@l, verbal, psychological abuse, also forcing me back in the closet in regards to being a transman (forcing me to act and dress female-presenting), fully gaslighting me about cheating, etc.) relationship at the time with a partner I was unfortunately reliant on for a place to live and had nowhere to go. I have a lot of regrets about some of the decisions made in this time of my life. When I was 22, about to turn 23, I was in a very abusive relationship and mourning the recent death of my grandfather. I needed a change of scenery, and my cousin kept urging me to apply for a job at the restaurant she worked at (not fast food, but full service with multiple kinds of cooks, with hosts, servers, dedicated to go people, and dishwashers; very busy place). Long story short, I begrudgingly, eventually applied and was hired basically the same day, for the dishwashing position. M (who had JUST turned 23 at the time, we're about six months apart) was a cook there, and everyone kinda warned me right off the bat that he was fairly antisocial and not to bother trying to make friends or anything (I'm a very bubbly, upbeat, friendly person outwardly as like a way of masking but also I just try to have a positive outlook on everyday life because I'm depressed and faking it helps? I don't know.), so I mostly steered clear of him aside from very limited work talk like ""where do you want these,"" ""do you want me to wash these?"" ""Thank you/you're welcome"" type stuff until one day when we had a call out in dish and since M had started in the dish room, one of the managers asked M to stay and help myself and the lady I was closing with (who had trained him in dish originally, I found out) close, since he was done closing his line, and we were so behind. We hit it off immediately, clicked so well, and he started talking to me like I had never seen him talk to anyone else in that building, it's been almost exactly 7 years, and I can still remember parts of this conversation and how it made me feel. We ended up talking in the parking lot, sitting in his car, after work until the sun actually came up, which ... Caused rumors at work. We were instant best friends, and everyone at work was convinced we were hooking up. M eventually convinced them to let me train him in the area where he was (making the bread) and then we were basically just spending 8 hours shifts together back there alone and then spending another five-seven just talking in the parking lot after, which eventually led to us hanging out at his like... Spiritual mentor/guru's house or local parks and stuff, like this person became my actual best friend. We were both (very obviously to each other and to everyone around us which caused some issues) super attracted to each other and crushing really hard but the entire two years we were friends, nothing ever happened beyond like a kiss on the forehead, some really long hugs/almost cuddling on his mentor person's couch, and occasional hand-holding. We had some difficult conversations about feelings and he would always say one thing but act another way or say one thing one day and then say another the next? Just very mixed signals. For example, I had multiple times offered to try to find a place to go, to leave my ex so things would be less complicated for us to figure out our feelings basically (we weren't dating), and some days he would be on board and would like offer to let me come live with him (he had his own house he was trying to fix up to sell or something, I don't remember why) until I could get on my feet, either romantically or not. But then some days we would have the same conversation and he would just get frustrated and angry and say for me to do whatever I wanted, that it was none of his business and that he didn't need to know what I was thinking about doing and had no interest in hearing me complain. This made me feel... Very uncomfortable about actually leaving my ex because I really had nowhere I could go at the time. Our job didn't pay me enough to just get my own place, and I was limited on friends or family who could help (and I hate asking for help anyway) because my ex had forced me to cut off or had created issues for me with so many people or my family just wasn't capable of helping at that time, if that makes sense? (To be clear, I'm not blaming M for me staying with my ex, or anything, really, just saying the solution he was offering, which was one of the only ones being offered, wasn't very stable, so I didn't feel very secure in that option.) Another example, sometimes he would tell me all of the things he wanted to do with me (romantically/sexually) and how he felt about me, and then thirty minutes later would be telling me he was abstaining from everything relationship and sex related for spiritual and life goal reasons because it was a distraction and would hold him back? Just constantly contradicting himself. Feelings got more intense, and the more intense they got on both sides, the more drastic his hot and cold mood swings got, to the point where he went from basically cuddling me and leaning it like he was almost going to kiss me to basically pushing me away and screaming at me about how we weren't together, and then he slowly started distancing himself from me? We would hang out less, he switched jobs (because of going back to college and needing different availability, he claims to this day it had nothing to do with me), and he would seem distracted when we talked, and shorter and more to the point with his texts and phone calls. Like a very slow, a little forced ghosting more than a drifting apart?? We eventually just stopped seeing each other after a little under two years ish total, but didn't have an actual friend breakup or anything. I ran into him one more time before he made this monumental move out of state (he'd been talking about doing this for a long time). Basically he ran into my ex (who I was still dating because I suck) at a coffee shop M and I used to frequent together, and ended up playing chess with my ex (who M recognized from meeting him at our work and from Facebook posts) and his brother basically to slowly bring me up and dig for information about me. My ex eventually called me to tell me that my friend from cracker barrel was there and I remember just absolutely racing over there, feeling like my heart was in my stomach, I didn't know what M was going to say to my ex about us, or about my ex (M knew a lot about my abuse at home and hated my ex), and I didn't know what M would say to my face, but I wanted to see him?? Conversation was awkward but like ... Longing, I guess, full of those ""we should hang out, text me"" vibes but you know neither of you is going to? And then he left for the other state like a month to four months later. We never tried making plans in that time. (This was so long and still doesn't really cover it but I'm trying to not write a novel here)

Some context about my history and relationship with my previous monogamous partner (C) who is now my nesting partner(new to terminology, sorry?) before this situation started: Shorter because there are just less necessary details and this is already so long, but I was still with my ex in 2022 (spent most of my adult life with that guy) and things had not substantially improved and some really messed up stuff had happened that I couldn't even wrap my head around or justify and we were just growing apart/having a lot of serious problems, like worse than before honestly, and neither of us were helping the situation because I'd started getting fed up and not treating him super great but I think it was just me not caring about the situation anymore? We had joined a dungeons and dragons group at a local game shop where I met C. We were just friends, but became very close friends to the point where my ex had a problem with it. Upon realizing how toxic my relationship was, C encouraged me to leave him and move in with my mom, actually helped me pack (situation had changed by this point and I could move home now but couldn't when I was working with M), and was basically my shoulder to cry on/vent to during the breakup and after when I might have gone back or not gone through with it otherwise. I might actually owe my life to him because the abuse was getting... A lot worse. (My ex had pulled a gun on me a few times and threatened to kill me and the beatings had gotten worse.) Eventually, we started dating a good while after I left my ex and have been together not quite two years but close as of the beginning of this current story. C ended up having to move in with my mother and I due to his mother's addiction issues and him having nowhere to go. He was abused verbally, emotionally, and sexually as a child and is very closed off and has poor communication skills, which makes things hard because I'm autistic and not great at dragging things out of people if I can't tell anything is wrong in the first place and they keep denying something is wrong when I ask. He's also touching/sex-repulsed at times and identifies as ace/graysexual and is very selective about what he wants to do/if he wants to be touched/where and how often, but I respect that and it doesn't affect our relationship too much. The communication issues and the fact that we're crammed in one room of my mother's house for almost two years now are much bigger issues than any of that, just thought it was worth mentioning. An issue is that I never know how he's feeling or what he's thinking, and often when I'm upset about something, C has a hard time understanding or relating or empathizing or doing any more than just listening like I'm talking to a brick wall and then just completely ignoring everything I've said and changing the subject entirely, and that's probably the only issue we really have but it's substantial? (This is going to come into play in the actual situation in a second because polyamory is ... Really based in open and honest communication from what I understand? So I promise I'm not complaining just to complain.) C has had... Mixed feelings about me being trans (when we first met, I was shoved into the closet still and then was wondering if I was genderfluid because of so long of being gaslit by my ex into thinking me being trans had been a phase? So the transition in his brain from me being genderfluid to just male has been hard for him?) and claims to not care necessarily but doesn't use the right terms (calls me girlfriend) or pronouns most of the time. I had to correct him multiple times and have several long conversations about it and how it makes me feel before he started even trying to put in more of an effort. Things were rocky with his family at first but are better now. I also work with his sister at my job. My mother loves him and has been very defensive of him in our relationship, to the point where it has become a little upsetting because it feels like they gang up on me sometimes. We are (or at least were; I don't know what's going on anymore) trying to get a place and move out, but this economy sucks and my current job is okay ish, but his is super not great and he is pretty bad about spending everything he makes if I'm being honest, despite living here for free (I pay rent to my mom and help with some of the bills, but he doesn't contribute beyond some groceries and gas. We have had some differences in opinion lately on some very big life goals. I want to get married soon and start thinking about wanting kids (once we're financially capable, obviously, but within the next five years) (adopted or surrogate or me carrying, I haven't decided), and he is just very attached to this young person, play video games and do what he wants when he wants to lifestyle and doesn't want to commit to me or to ever having children of any kind ever. This is a newer development in our relationship that I have been having a really hard time with because he used to want to get married, but has seemingly changed his mind, and used to talk about the possibility of kids a little more neutrally, rather than as a hard no. 

The story leading up to this transition to polyamory: In the spring of 2024, after four years of radio silence, M reached out to me over Facebook messenger to catch up and apologize for treating me so poorly back in the day and let me know how everything was going in their life. They were in a field that they were really passionate about, doing a really great job out there, had found a good social network of close friends, and had come out as poly/ambiamorous and bigender. (M uses he/she/they pronouns interchangeably now, but I used he in the backstory because I just thought that would be less confusing) At first I was really panicky about talking to them, but everything seemed a lot less toxic and normal (they could be a little toxic back in the day but still a lot better compared to my ex), not like they wanted anything from me other than just to reconnect and genuinely see how I was doing. I was open and honest about who this person was to me to C from the moment M messaged me, but was adamant that while I had been in love with this person and they had their claws in me pretty deep at one time, I had never actually been involved involved with them, just heavy courting, I guess, and that I didn't expect anything would come of it and that I would tell C if anything inappropriate was discussed or advances were made. C trusts me inherently, almost to a fault, so that wasn't an issue. M and I talked on and off but both of us deal with depression so there were sometimes month long gaps in our conversations, but around the holidays, M messaged me to tell me they were coming home for the holidays to see family and wanted to see me if they could while they were home just to catch up in person and to have an escape from their parents house while they were home for a week to avoid cabin fever. I asked C if it was okay, and he said it was fine. I offered to let him come, he didn't want to. Plans were made. I let M know (or reminded them at least) that I had a partner, and we were monogamous, just to avoid any confusion, and they said they respected my relationship boundaries and would not behave inappropriately and we even had a nice conversation about my partner and how we met and all of that good stuff. So I thought everything was cool. We hung out, did a ton of talking (got coffee and then went to a park and then dinner and then a bookstore) (like 10+ hours) and I got a lot of closure for why they had acted the way they were acting back then and just a lot of closure in general (they were in a secret relationship that was kind of open but abusive and codependent back then, had unresolved trauma from sexual abuse in their childhood and teens, and were used to being used and left and me being in my relationship made them feel very insecure, things that legitimately made sense and made me feel better about getting ghosted and all of the mixed signals), so I was feeling pretty okay by the end of the day. I want to say they flew in on Wednesday and this was the Thursday they were home. Friday was their birthday, and I didn't see them, but I called to wish them a happy birthday before they went to bed. They had unfortunately caught the flu on the plane and were having to quarantine, and I'd already had it this season because I work with the public, so I offered to come over to their parents' house and sit with them after work on Saturday. We just talked and listened to music and had some difficult conversations about past feelings and events, and just did more talking, but nothing inappropriate was discussed really. C was fine with me going, and I checked in multiple times while I was there. My mother was not fine with it and ended up calling and texting me multiple times, which I didn't see until I was leaving, due to my phone still being on silent from being at work. (I always call my mom or someone when I'm driving somewhere if I'm alone, I don't know why.) She made a really big deal out of me going and hanging out with M and staying gone most of the night (I got off around 7pm ish and left their house probably close to midnight, but my sleep schedule is kinda messed up and I don't go to bed until 2-4am most nights). The next day, M and I hung out (with C's blessing) and then picked up C, so we could do last minute Christmas shopping together, and the two of them could meet finally because my mother thought it would be healthy and M wanted to meet C. C didn't really care one way or the other, but didn't mind? M also met my mother when we were picking up C from my house, which, I believe, is the first time in all of these years that they had ever met. C & M seemed to get along okay and talked quite a bit, joking around. I was glad they were at least trying to be friends. We hung out for awhile doing the Christmas shopping, and then I dropped C back off at home and took M back to their car, but we ended up sitting in the car talking for a really long time, and at some point, I had an epiphany and finally recognized what I'd been feeling all week as the same exact feelings I'd always had for M? Which was upsetting. I'd been mistaking it for just normal excitement and happiness to see a friend, but no, it was just like I'd stepped into a time machine to 2018, and they'd never left my life. It was the same exact feeling, so I had a lot of feelings to process when I got home that night. I guess some of it could be akin to NRE despite nothing happening happening but it's not a new person or a new crush?? It's 7 years old? So I don't know. I also had ended up catching the flu anyway, so it must have been a different strain or something, and M offered for me to swing by their house the next morning to get the rest of their medicine since they couldn't take it back on the plane. I did, once again with C's blessing. At this point, I was mostly trying to ignore my feelings, even as I was sitting in their living room talking to their parents, getting a full tour of their house and garden, and sitting talking to them in their old bedroom. Everything somewhat felt like it was out of a dream, but I tried my best to remain composed and act appropriately, but at the forefront of my mind, I just kept thinking that they were leaving for the airport the next day. I was actively panicky, having feelings of dread and making myself nauseous. I really didn't want them to go. I didn't even want to go to work. I just wanted to be beside them until the last possible second, which was when I acknowledged that I really, genuinely had a problem to deal with because I kept trying to put down these feelings, and it just wasn't working at all. I ended up, idiotically, volunteering to take them to the airport in the morning, despite knowing I wouldn't get off work until like 2:45 am and they had to be at the airport before 8:30 am, so it was decided I would sleep at M's house (in a different room from where M was staying) to save time travelling in the morning. (I checked in with C; he didn't care.) Except M didn't sleep in the other room. They just sat up with me talking until like an hour before we were supposed to get up and we ended up napping on the bed I was supposed to be sleeping in. When I woke up, we were in a bit of a cuddling position, but we didn't go to sleep that way, so I kinda shrugged it off. The drive to the airport was like driving to my death though, and by the time we got there, we were both close to crying. I actually did cry. We hugged for a really long time, and I just didn't want to let them go. M did end up going, but there was a second when I thought he was going to change his mind. The next day, he confessed that he was still in love with me and wanted to not only be with me, and when asked how serious he was about that (because I was confused), he said he wanted to marry me one day, that he always had, and started asking me if I could ever consider moving to the city he lives in. Shocked, and not thinking clearly because I'd been waiting 7 years for this man to confess his feelings to me outright, I basically said this was coming out of nowhere, moving really fast, that I didn't know what was going on anymore, and that I could hypothetically consider moving, but thankfully did acknowledge that I really needed to talk to C asap, because I was confused and conflicted about a lot of feelings I was having. M kept suggesting I ask if we could just try being poly, because M is poly/ambi and was very open to the idea. I eventually brought it up to C when I could, and at first C was very against the idea, like immediately, so I tried explaining the differences between an open relationship and poly and C seemed more willing to break up (despite living with my mother and I and having nowhere to go) than even trying the poly, and I didn't want to do any kind of poly under duress type situation so I basically said I thought we needed a break so I could figure things out then and started crying (not like in a guilt trippy way but just I was really upset because I do love both of them and was genuinely not sure what to do in the current situation, but things were going too far, and I needed to figure things out before progressing any further at all) and he held me for awhile, and then finally said we could try since I couldn't seem to choose so it kinda seems like the poly has happened in lieu of a break but said they would let me know if they had an actual problem with it, and I asked multiple times if it was okay before I told M? 

The current situation: M is a big fan of Kitchen Table Poly, while C seems to just not want to know anything about the other situation and wants to pretend it isn't happening, so M isn't super happy about C not wanting to communicate or be friends with M. C seems to be okay but not overly happy/was already having some mild seasonal depression, but I've been checking in on C often to see how they're feeling, but I feel like he's being dishonest. I asked multiple times if they want to reevaluate the situation or if C is just stealth breaking up with me or something, and C says he's actually ""fully committed to the relationship and trying to hang onto the relationship with everything that he has,"" which is worrisome in itself. C also claims to not be jealous of M in any way and to not feel neglected? Tbb, in general, since I have M to rant to, C and I have actually been fighting less because I'm not having to deal with C's emotional constipation every time I need to vent about something? I genuinely think it's been better for my emotional state, balancing the two, but I worry about C. M is fine with pretty much everything, but worries C will change his mind about the open relationship and is upset that anytime I try to have a boundaries talk with C, he just says he ""doesn't care,"" and to ""not be weird,"" which is just too vague to go off of. I've been told I'm allowed to fly out to go see M at the end of January (I asked permission), but I don't even know if we're allowed to do physical stuff or not, because C won't talk to me about it at all. ... I feel like the reason C might be okay with it is because M lives so far away and they aren't a part of our everyday lives aside from me texting and calling them, but I recently (this week) found out that M is coming home with me when I fly out there due to the health of one of their parents declining. They have asked me to cancel my return flight and drive back with them so they can move home. I worry about ... All of this, but I especially worry about how M coming home will affect our fragile relationship dynamic. M has also talked about the three of us living together, and C is absolutely not receptive because C thinks it will put him in a bad situation, because if we break up, he won't have anywhere to go (but that's the situation currently because we live with MY mom), but says I can live with M and continue to date C? But I don't know if this is supposed to be passive aggressive or what but he claims he's being genuine?? C doesn't really have anywhere to go, so I wonder if he would just continue to live with my mother? We have not told my mother about the poly... Thing. M keeps calling it a parallel poly hinge but that's just word soup to me. Currently it feels a little mono/poly because neither of them are trying to date anyone else (but I haven't forbidden it, it just doesn't seem like they're interested in seeing other people)

TLDR: Had a strong mutual connection with someone 7 years ago when I was in an abusive relationship but never did anything with it, they recently reappeared into my life, I realized I still had feelings, and my mono partner and I have decided to be poly so I can long distance date this other person. I feel like I'm neglecting everyone's needs and boundaries. My new partner is suddenly having to move home due to family issues and wants to (eventually) be a nesting partner and maybe marry me and have kids. My current nesting partner doesn't want to marry/have kids/ nest with my new partner, despite being invited to live with us by my new partner. We currently live with my mom, so I don't know where my current nesting partner would go. I'm trying so hard to keep everyone happy, but communication isn't happening despite me trying.

1hvwzov,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ecoflow_community/comments/1hvwzov/want_to_add_a_delta_3_plus_to_my_rv_for_ac/,Want to add a Delta 3 Plus to my RV for AC - Boondocking Trips,"I currently have an RV motor home which has one  LiTime 12vdc - 230 amp-hr LiFePO4 house battery, an onboard Onan 5500 watt gas generator, a 14.6 vdc - 50 amp ac-dc converter, and a LiTime 14.6 vdc 20/40 amp DC/DC charger. My LiTime LiFePO4 house battery can be charged from either the ac-dc converter while connected to 120 volt AC or while running the Onan 5500 watt gas generator and/or by running the engine/alternator through the LiTime 14. 6 DC/DC 20/40 amp charger. I have no solar charging at this time. 

I would like to add a Delta 3 Plus to my rig so that while ""boondocking"" with no 120v service available I can run a 1500 watt output through my RV's 120v circuit and be able to run loads (less than 1500 watts). I'll need to disconnect my ac-dc converter while using the Delta 3 Plus. I'll be able to run the microwave (1200 watts), coffee maker (650 watts), TV (120 watts) and the fridge on AC. I'll have to be aware of the total loads not to exceed 1500 watts. Normally I just run my Onan generator for AC needs while boondocking but campgrounds have varying quiet hours when generators are not allowed to be operated. So for those times I plan on using the Delta 3 Plus. I can then recharge the Delta 3 Plus by either running my engine/alternator with the DC/DC charger and/or my generator through the ac-dc converter charger.

 I plan to make 2 cables with ring terminals on one end and XT60 connectors on the other end. The ring terminals would be connected to my positive and negative bus bars. These bus bars are a central location for the LiTime lithium battery, input form the 14.6vdc - 50 amp converter/charger and the LiTime 14.6vdc - 20/40 amp DC/DC charger. The each of the 2 XT60 connectors would be attached to the 2 Delta 3 Plus XT60 inputs. Will the total watt input be 438 watts (14.6v x 15 amps x 2) to the Delta 3 Plus? Does the Delta 3 Plus XT60 inputs limit the input amperage to 15 amps automatically?

The LiTime DC/DC charger prevents dc voltage backflow to the chassis battery. Will the Delta 3 Plus DC voltage current backflow to the LiTime LiFePO4 battery through the XT60 connection setup?

Is this a viable option or have I missed something? Your comments/suggestions are most welcome. Thanks.

1hvwx4n,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Pure_March_5322/comments/1hvwx4n/beach_set_to_music/,Beach set to music,"I really enjoyed doing this because Yuri's poems, set lyrically, naturally lend themselves to more mature music that builds more slowly and requires more patience from the listener, more of their noggin, to look for subtleties or meaning in other things.

Anyway hi, to those who don't know, two years ago I made an EP taking every poem from the first game with a rhyme in it and setting it to music. Now I'm taking them all and revising them. This means Yuri only gets one poem, but it's the longest on the EP and one of my favorites overall. I even want through the trouble of getting my coffee (no tea available) and cigarillo, which the lighting is the sound in the beginning, so I could get in the mood... Hehe.

1hvwvp9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hvwvp9,"Something new seen at CES 2025 - Zeroth Law, consistent espresso with room temp. water.","This week, I‚Äôm exhibiting at the CES and I ran into this Korean startup, developing a really interesting new espresso machine.

Basically, what they told me was that this machine produces consistent, well-extracted espresso at room temperature. The coffee was amazing (co-fermented though, today they‚Äôd brew more classical roasts for the general public.

Some notes:
- Workflow was super easy, bottomless pf, no need to lock it tight
- No heat up required, reducing 97% of the energy needed. 
- Machine draws only 30 watts +
- Much lower oxidation and flavour changes (no temperature drop-off)

One major usp they mentioned was a consistent and automated pressure throughout the shot by the machine itself. It continuously tracks the change in pressure (bars) and keeps it steady at 8bars brewing pressure. The graphs also showed this. A steady ramp up, followed by a horizontal brew line. No trailing or manual lever action needed.

This, according to them results in consistent quality and flavour. They mentioned that they conducted research that showed when brewing at high temperatures, the majority of inconsistency, problematic flavours, astringency etc. Is caused by particles traveling through the puck into the coffee. This would be caused by the increase in pressure/bars as the coffee extracts, pushing more fines and unwanted particles through.

Interesting point, they mentioned that the difference between flat and conical burrs with their machine was negligible (not sure how etc. As I needed to get moving haha)

Lots of other information to be shared but that was the core of the story. Prices were about 7k usd I believe. 

Personal experience:
- coffee was great, fruity, high clarity.
- Directly drinkable
- Workflow was easy.

I‚Äôm curious whether this roomtemp/cold espresso would be something most people would be open to switch to as drinking hot/warm coffee is also a cultural/habitual thing I suppose. According to the company, in Korea, most people drink milk drinks and/or iced americano, making this machine very market oriented in SK.

It went well, I'd rate it a 6, the conversation flowed well with no breaks or downtime. He suggested we extend the date to go for coffee and chat some more and so we did and chatted in his car for a while. Afterwards, I don't know if I gave him any particular sign (or maybe I did, tbf some things I do could be perceived as flirting), but he asked me if he could kiss me and at the time I said no. I don't have a personal rule not to kiss on the first date but I didn't feel like it. I've kissed guys on the first date and some on the 5th or 6th for no particular reason. It was a tiny bit awkward, but I managed to diffuse the mood, and he drove me home then asked me if he could kiss me on the cheek and I happily agreed. He texted me afterwards so I think it's fine (but also it's the next day and he hasn't texted me yet lol) but when I was debriefing with my friend, she told me that it must have bruised his ego and that he might see it as a lack of interest on my part (which isn't the case, I would go on a second date). My question is how is it perceived for a guy if the girl doesn't kiss you on the first date? Is it usually expected? Because personally, I'm not doing it to be polite like a handshake or a hug, only if the chemistry was exceptionally good imo.

Cult Leaders' Tactics:

1. False intimacy
   * Acts 2 / Gracepoint / Berkland is so good at this. They make you feel like they love you to create false intimacy. Intimacy immediately disappears once your leader/mentor is reassigned to someone else or another ministry. And of course, once you leave, all relationships are essentially severed. They will be too busy to stay in touch with you.
2. Manufactured trust
   * This is where the religious abuse comes in. They make you trust your mentor/leader and the pastors in the name of God. They quote lines from the bible and misuse them. They pressure you to not trust yourself and trust their perspective instead since you are ""a depraved sinner."" Since they showered you with love (coffee, boba, rides, etc.) you feel like you owe it to them to do what they suggest. Since they cried with you during that one Sunday when you rededicated your life, you feel like you should be able to trust anything your leader says.
3. Blurred lines between truth and fiction
   * You can be sure about your own motivations, but slowly they make you question yourself. You are there to love God, but they tell you that you're there to date or get married (just cuz you expressed slight interest in someone or said Hi to them) or just to coast. You think... maybe I am? You know you want to serve God to the best of your ability but they tell you that you are lazy since you missed morning devotions twice this week. They question your own sense of reality.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Are you a coffee enthusiast searching for the ultimate single-serve coffee maker?  Do you crave the convenience of a pod-based system but also desire the rich, creamy texture of a barista-made beverage? Then your search might end with the Keurig K-Cafe Barista Bar. This comprehensive review and buyer's guide will delve into the features, performance, and overall value of this innovative machine, helping you decide if it's the perfect addition to your kitchen.</p>


<h2>Product Overview: More Than Just a Keurig</h2>

<p>The Keurig K-Cafe Barista Bar isn't your average Keurig.  While maintaining the simplicity of K-Cup pod brewing, it significantly elevates the coffee experience by incorporating a built-in milk frother. This allows you to craft a wide range of beverages, from simple brewed coffee to frothy lattes and cappuccinos, all from the convenience of your countertop.  It's a significant leap forward for single-serve coffee makers, bridging the gap between convenience and caf√©-quality drinks.</p>


<h2>Design and Build Quality: A Durable and Stylish Machine</h2>

<p>The K-Cafe Barista Bar boasts a sleek, modern design that will complement most kitchen styles. While primarily constructed from plastic, it feels surprisingly sturdy and well-built. The materials used are durable, resisting scratches and everyday wear and tear.  The size (12 x 10 x 18 inches) and weight (approximately 16 pounds) are manageable, making it easy to place and use even on smaller countertops.  Unlike some single-serve machines, it doesn't feel cheap or flimsy ‚Äì it's designed for longevity.</p>


<h2>Coffee Quality and Flavor: Exploring Brewing Capabilities</h2>

<p>The K-Cafe Barista Bar shines when it comes to coffee quality. Using your favorite K-Cup pods (including the reusable My K-Cup filter for ground coffee), you can enjoy a consistent and flavorful brew every time.  The machine offers three cup sizes (8, 10, and 12 oz), allowing you to customize your serving size. While it doesn't offer the same level of customization as a manual espresso machine, it delivers a remarkably smooth and rich brew, surpassing many other single-serve options.  The brewing process is efficient and relatively quick, reducing wait times for your morning caffeine fix.</p>

<h3>Espresso-Style Coffee: A Notable Feature</h3>

<p>One of the key selling points is its ability to create espresso-style coffee.  While not true espresso (it lacks the pressure of a dedicated espresso machine), the resulting beverage is surprisingly close.  The concentrated brew provides a bolder flavor and a crema-like layer on top, enhancing the overall coffee experience. This feature alone sets it apart from many competitors within the single-serve coffee maker category.</p>


<h2>Frother Functionality: Crafting Creamy Perfection</h2>

<p>The integrated milk frother is a game-changer. It's incredibly easy to use, producing both hot and cold frothed milk with minimal effort.  The frother handles a variety of milk types, including dairy milk and many non-dairy alternatives (almond, soy, oat milk, etc.).  Experimenting with different milk types will allow you to find your perfect balance of texture and flavor.  While some users have reported minor consistency issues, these are often resolved by following the machine's instructions and practicing the technique a few times.</p>

<h3>Tips for Perfect Frothing:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Use cold milk for cold froth and slightly warmed milk for hot froth for optimal results.</li>
    <li>Ensure the frothing chamber is clean before each use to prevent clogging.</li>
    <li>Don't overfill the frothing chamber; leave some space for expansion.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Ease of Use and Operation: Simplicity Meets Sophistication</h2>

<p>The Keurig K-Cafe Barista Bar prioritizes user-friendliness. The control panel is intuitive and easy to navigate, with clear icons and minimal buttons.  Brewing a cup is a straightforward process, and the machine guides you through each step.  The removable water reservoir (42 oz capacity) is easy to fill and clean, further enhancing convenience.  The machine also provides descaling notifications to remind you to clean the machine regularly, ensuring optimal performance and extending its lifespan.</p>

<h3>Maintenance and Cleaning: Keeping Your Machine in Top Shape</h3>

<p>Regular descaling is essential to maintain the machine's performance (Keurig recommends descaling every 500 brews).  The process is relatively simple, using Keurig's descaling solution. Cleaning the frothing chamber after each use is also crucial to prevent milk residue buildup.  Simple rinsing with warm water is usually sufficient.  A quick wipe-down of the exterior after each use keeps the machine looking clean and prolongs its lifespan.</p>


<h2>Additional Features: Enhancing Your Coffee Experience</h2>

<p>Beyond the core functionality, the Keurig K-Cafe Barista Bar offers several additional features that enhance the overall user experience:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>High-Altitude Brewing Mode:</b> This feature adjusts the brewing process for optimal performance at higher altitudes, ensuring consistent coffee quality regardless of your location.</li>
    <li><b>Back-to-Back Brewing Capability:</b>  Brew multiple cups consecutively without lengthy wait times for the machine to reheat.</li>
    <li><b>My K-Cup Compatibility:</b> Use your own ground coffee with the reusable My K-Cup filter, providing greater flexibility in coffee choices.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Customer Reviews and Feedback: Real-World Perspectives</h2>

<p>The Keurig K-Cafe Barista Bar has received generally positive reviews across various online platforms.  Many users praise its ease of use, the quality of the coffee and frothed milk, and its compact design.  Common praises include the convenience, the speed of brewing, and the ability to create a variety of coffee drinks.  However, some users have reported occasional inconsistencies with the frother, and some have experienced minor issues with the machine's durability over extended use.  Overall, the positive feedback outweighs the negative, suggesting a generally satisfying user experience for most consumers.</p>


<h2>Keurig K-Cafe Barista Bar vs. Competitors: A Comparison</h2>

<p>Compared to other single-serve coffee makers, the K-Cafe Barista Bar stands out due to its integrated milk frother and ability to create various coffee drinks.  While other machines might offer similar brewing capabilities, few match its versatility and ease of use in creating lattes and cappuccinos.  Its primary competition comes from other high-end single-serve brewers with advanced features, but these often lack the all-in-one convenience of the K-Cafe Barista Bar.</p>


<h2>Technical Specifications</h2>

<ul>
    <li><b>Dimensions:</b> 12 x 10 x 18 inches</li>
    <li><b>Weight:</b> Approximately 16 pounds</li>
    <li><b>Brew Options:</b> 8 oz, 10 oz, 12 oz</li>
    <li><b>Water Reservoir Capacity:</b> 42 oz</li>
    <li><b>Power:</b> 120V, 60Hz</li>
</ul>


<h2>Conclusion: A Worthy Investment for Coffee Lovers</h2>

<p>The Keurig K-Cafe Barista Bar is more than just a single-serve coffee maker; it's a versatile and convenient appliance that elevates your daily coffee ritual. While it might not replace a high-end espresso machine for true espresso aficionados, it offers an excellent compromise between convenience and quality.  Its ease of use, ability to create a variety of drinks, and relatively durable design make it a worthwhile investment for coffee enthusiasts seeking a seamless and enjoyable brewing experience at home.</p>


<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

<p><b>Q: Can I use any type of milk in the frother?</b></p>
<p>A: While it works well with many types of milk (dairy and non-dairy), some thicker or creamier options may require more frothing time or adjustments to achieve the desired texture. Experimentation is key.</p>

<p><b>Q: How often should I descale the machine?</b></p>
<p>A: Keurig recommends descaling every 500 brews or as indicated by the machine's descaling notification.</p>

<p><b>Q: What kind of K-Cups can I use?</b></p>
<p>A: You can use any standard Keurig K-Cup pod.</p>

<p><b>Q: Does it make iced coffee?</b></p>
<p>A: While it doesn't have a dedicated iced coffee setting, you can brew coffee over ice for a refreshing iced beverage.</p>

*Copy paste from [this](https://thehiddennews.in/the-great-queue-chronicles-of-jammus-civil-secretariat/) article*

Amid the bustling power corridors of the Jammu Civil Secretariat, where decisions shaping millions of lives are expected to be made with swift precision, lies an ironic spectacle: the visitors‚Äô queue‚Äîa scene where democracy meets patience in a bureaucratic display worthy of reflection.

For the uninitiated, visiting the Civil Secretariat as a member of the public is less about resolving grievances and more about surviving the entrance ritual. The ordeal begins with hopeful citizens, clutching their grievances and dreams, gathering at the gates well before the clock strikes 1 PM‚Äîthe sacred hour when the public is allowed to step onto the hallowed grounds. By then, the queue resembles a human tapestry of determination, frustration, and silent resignation.

The procedure is straightforward‚Äîat least on paper. Identification cards are checked, passes issued, and security frisking conducted through metal detectors. Simple, right? Except, of course, when the system collapses under its own inefficiency. Out of the five registration counters meant to handle the influx, only two appears to be operational. The others? Perhaps on a long coffee break or lost in bureaucratic oblivion.

To their credit, three queue on a single counter designated for women, senior citizens, and the differently-abled does function, the other counter serve a single queue. But for the remaining, the waiting game is as unpredictable as the region‚Äôs politics. On a good day, visitors are merely delayed by an hour. On a bad day, they‚Äôre left wondering if they‚Äôve accidentally stumbled into a test of endurance rather than a public service office.

Now, let‚Äôs not be insensitive to the security protocols of a sensitive region like Jammu and Kashmir. Thorough checks are necessary and non-negotiable. But does that justify a system where citizens must spend hours in line, only to receive a pass that serves as their ticket to further delays inside? Surely, even in the most security-conscious of environments, efficiency and sensitivity to public time can coexist.

The solution isn‚Äôt rocket science. How about ensuring all counters are functional during public hours? Or employing technology to streamline registration and reduce the burden on overworked staff? Heck, even a simple token system could work wonders in turning this queue into something less reminiscent of a 20th-century ration line.

As things stand, the public servants inside the Secretariat seem blissfully unaware of the irony outside. While they debate policies to improve governance and citizen engagement, those very citizens are left wondering whether they‚Äôll make it past the gate before the office closes for the day. Here‚Äôs a humble suggestion for the powers that be: spare a thought for the people outside your walls. After all, democracy isn‚Äôt just about power; it‚Äôs also about making sure the powerless don‚Äôt have to queue for hours to have their voices heard.",2,1736270376.0,jammu,0,1.0,False

1hvwfir,https://www.reddit.com/r/PERSoNA/comments/1hvwfir/my_review_of_persona_3_reload/,My review of Persona 3 reload,"Persona 3 Reload proved that a well-thought-out style is the key to a good game. When the game starts with a bursting blue and white opening and ends with fading dark credits, you understand how much the developers wanted to maintain the game's overall tone. The interface is designed in a way that the player can use it intuitively. The overarching plot isn't something completely revelatory, unlike the fifth part, where there were several mysteries and a certain suspense. In the third game, the main twists are quite predictable, but it still knows how to show its own cards. But the stories of the characters themselves and their relationships‚Äîmy utmost respect, Atlus. ABSOLUTELY every character brought a unique flavor to the game's world, demonstrated different emotions and problems that we helped them overcome. It's that moment when you go to interact with the characters not because it gives some gameplay perks, but simply because it's interesting what the character will come up with this time. Just think of the touching story about the elderly couple or the red-haired girl who recently lost her only parent. You enjoy spending time in the local school and the cozy, well-designed districts with their dawdling inhabitants, who have specific interests, and you watch their development throughout the ENTIRE GAME without any interference from us.

Returning to the style, I want to emphasize how GODLY the soundtrack is here. It's the calling card of the entire series, because the composers really earned their bread (as did everyone in the studio). The Stage and Screen genre puts you into a state of both energetic and relaxing flow, enticing the player to continue their daily rituals: go to class, joke around with your buddy at recess, help a classmate find a girlfriend, brew some coffee with the dorm head. All the aforementioned events you REALLY want to relive, because throughout all 80 hours of gameplay, there wasn't a single thought about a boringly spent day.

The good old JRPG system is still the core of the battle system and is capable of entertaining both a newcomer to the genre and a veteran. The bright and coolly animated character abilities bring a certain variety to the semi-static battles. Tartarus, which is the local multi-story dungeon equivalent, has differently styled sections; it's pleasant to be there, and with each floor, our progress becomes more complex. The final boss has his own quirks and jokes, I liked that the fight with him turned out to be harder than previous ones, even impressive (heard of Dark Souls 1???). By the end of the story, we're faced with parting ways with this beautiful and contrasting world and its inhabitants, something I really loved in the fifth game, and now I felt a similar high in Reload, but the remake has a certain unique vibe; you feel more of the originality and inevitability of change, unlike the intensity of Persona 5. In any case, I got the desired range of emotions from parting ways with the characters; the game turned out to be touching and left a warm mark in my heart. 9/10 üíôüíôüíô",0,1736270193.0,PERSoNA,1,0.29,False

When I was diagnosed, I was put on Nexium 40 mg for years. After reading about the negatives for it, Dr switched me over to Omeprazole which I have been taking now for many years, 20 mg, once per day in the AM, 1/2 hour before I eat anything. Up until Friday life has been grand. My usual evening snack is popcorn. I usually pan pop with canola oil and the top with flavacol, just a little of it because it‚Äôs potent. I like to eat it when I read, which I do frequently. Wednesday, no issue. Thursday, no issue, Friday morning woke up to belly pain and heartburn, took the omeprazole, got breakfast down, 1/2 bowl Raisin Bran. Couldn‚Äôt drink my coffee. I was a mess all day Friday. Deep burning burps and flatulence all day. Was worse at night, thought I caught a bug. Had some diarrhea.

. Next morning woke up feeling better. Avoided eating much on Saturday kept the fluids going in. Had Chicken and a veg for dinner on Saturday. 

  Woke up Sunday feeling better yet, figured must of been a bug. Had Lasagna for dinner, had popcorn snack. Went to bed, woke up Monday, right as rain. Monday was fine. Had Pork and Sauerkraut for dinner Monday night, popcorn snack, BAM this morning heartburn again. Not as bad as Friday, but still, indigestion, heartburn, etc. 

So I ask thee, for thoughts. Is it the popcorn that‚Äôs causing my issue? Is it some other issue, maybe GERD is getting worse? Maybe I need to up the Omeprazole? Call the Dr, get my Upper GI done early. This is definitely something out of the norm for me. Kinda has me concerned. Sorry it went so long. Thanks in advance!",1,1736270150.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

I'm just uncomfortable with what's happening and need to vent, I guess. In short, I had this friend. We weren't even that close, I guess, but I had been finding excuses not to go out for coffee with her for weeks because I was so busy with work and just didn't want to see people.

And then she died. Complications sue to her diabetes, no one really saw it coming. This was last year, around october

Now, her grandmother took over her instagram (she didn't have parents or siblings). And at first she would just post old photos and it was painful to see it pop up on my feed, but normal enough. However, for the past week or so, she's been posting AI generated images of my deceased friend. And, to make it worse, there's random men commentkng heart emojis on them (it's an open profile). And it's just so wrong and uncanny to look at, like it's her but with tiny details all wrong about her face. 

I know different people grieve in different ways and all that but even after I stopped following the profile some other friends of ours are also talking abt how it doesn't seem healthy and it's just upsetting me so much to think her grandmother is probably suffering, and I don't know how to or if I even could approach this situation and yalk to her about it, and I honestly just wish she would stop.

C++ Dev (Angry, fed up):

Yo, yo, Rust Compiler, I‚Äôm outta here,

This language is too hard, I‚Äôm drowning in fear.

You said ""ownership"", ""borrowing"", all this crap‚Äî

But I'm just trying to code, not get caught in your trap!



Lifetimes? You wanna be picky with that?

Can‚Äôt even clone a string, you gotta check every stat!

You think memory safety‚Äôs cool? Nah, it's a chore,

I‚Äôm just trying to build a thing, not play code folklore!



You keep throwing errors like it‚Äôs a sport,

I‚Äôm stuck in a borrow checker like it‚Äôs my last resort!

I just wanna iterate, but you make it so tight,

Every time I try to run, you block me all night.



I thought Rust would be smooth, you know‚Äînext-gen,

 I just want to build without all the fuss,

Why you gotta make it so strict, so non-trust?

I get it, memory safety, that‚Äôs your big claim,

But you‚Äôre too damn picky, and that‚Äôs just lame.



C++ lets me do my thing, no rules to obey,

But with you, every line‚Äôs a fight‚ÄîI'm losing my way!

Yeah, I get it, you‚Äôre safe, but ain‚Äôt no fun in that,

I‚Äôm just tryna build features, not get caught in a trap.



Your borrow checker don‚Äôt let me breathe,

I‚Äôm just tryna pass data, ain't got time for grief.

Lifetimes, ownership‚Äîbro, just let me be,

I wanna code without feeling like I‚Äôm stuck in a tree!



I‚Äôm gone, Rust‚Äîyou‚Äôre too hard to tame,

You got me stuck in lifetimes, scared of a ref,

I just want to pass data without causing death!

Borrowing this, owning that‚Äîman, this is insane,

I‚Äôm just trying to code, not get caught in your pain!



You hit me with ""Cannot borrow here!""

Like I‚Äôm playing some game, but I‚Äôm the one who‚Äôs in fear!

You‚Äôre too strict, too harsh, like a grammar teacher,

Just let me code, man, stop acting like a preacher!

You‚Äôre treating me like some kind of noob in school.

All I wanted was speed, but now I‚Äôm stuck,

In a world of lifetime checks and undefined luck.



Your borrow checker don‚Äôt let me move a thing,

I just want to reassign a variable, let it spread its wings.

I came to you for safety, but man, it‚Äôs a bind‚Äî

C++ gives me freedom, while you just bind my mind!



I don‚Äôt want to think before every line,

Just give me a pointer, let it cross the line!

Rust, you‚Äôre like that overbearing friend,

Always telling me what to do, but I just wanna end!

I tried, Rust, I tried, but I can‚Äôt take it no more‚Äî

You‚Äôre like a locked door, and I can‚Äôt find the floor.



I‚Äôm walking away, I‚Äôve had enough of your grind,

C++ is where I belong, it‚Äôs where I can unwind.

Rust, you‚Äôre too hard, I gotta live my life‚Äî

I‚Äôm not ready to be tamed by your strife.



A few weeks have passed.\[LAUGHING\]

You know what? I gotta admit‚Ä¶

Leaving Rust? Best decision I ever made.

I‚Äôm sitting here, coffee in hand, code compiling in seconds,

No more staring at the screen, waiting for the borrow checker‚Äôs sentence.



C++, baby, I‚Äôm back in my zone,

Just me and my pointers, no need for the clone.

Rust? Yeah, it had safety, it had rules and all that,

But I‚Äôd rather live dangerously, with my crashes intact.



I don‚Äôt miss those lifetimes, I don‚Äôt miss the pain,

No more ‚Äúcan‚Äôt borrow that‚Äù‚ÄîI'm writing my own train.

I just want to code without your shackles on me,

And, hell, C++ lets me do that wild and free.

I don‚Äôt need to check every borrow, or worry about ownership chains,

I‚Äôm coding like a free spirit, with no strings, no reins.

My segfaults? Yeah, they happen, but you know what? I don‚Äôt care,

I‚Äôm crashing with style, man, I don‚Äôt need your perfect air.



Remember when you tried to teach me about memory?

Told me about safety and how I should be wary?

Well, guess what? My app's running just fine,

And I‚Äôm not feeling guilty, not even a line.



Yeah, Rust, you were hardcore, you were strict and precise,

But I‚Äôd rather roll the dice, and take my wild code nice.

I‚Äôm a C++ soldier, got my head held high,

Rust‚Äôs not my style, man, and now I know why.

1hvwctq,https://www.reddit.com/r/LuigiMangioneJustice/comments/1hvwctq/i_n_s_u_r_a_n_c_e/,I N S U R A N C E ,"The Movie Script on Brian Thompson's well staged getaway plan and the many details
that evidence a well paid network of smurfs 

Here's how my morning coffee went musing on LNM current POI.

- Let's look at why Brian went to New York to speak to the investors after he unloaded a lot of stock in inside trading. 
- He certainly wasn't Mr. popular at that time. - He likely was going to deliver some thing maybe not too popular. 
- US HealthCare had to rescind a policy decision. Imagine the shareholders making a shot ton of money on these decisions and the lawyers making a shit ton receiving duvidends on the premiums... they liked the policies Brian ruled on that lined their pockets.
- Policies that were the antithesis of saving lives and a moral outrage to the medically needy consumers and clients who became victims of his policies. 
- I'm not buying that he didn't have the authority to actually enact those policies as a CEO, BTW. He's the head man and it's his operation, Like the captain of the titanic captain goes down with his ship.

So here's my diagnosis. 

- Super shady and corrupt alcoholic (DUI) guy Making $10 million a year estranged from his wife is guilty of inside, trading, unloading a lot of stock, knowing that there's gonna be some bad news ahead to his investors. 

Here's the ""script"" goes like this in my movie: 

- Bri' definitely did not want to stand before that audience and get shot with, however many bullets were going to be in those seats in that conference room auditorium. If he didn't get shot outside, he was gonna get shot inside and if he didn't get shot inside, he was going to get shot outside leaving. 

- Better To get shot entering then go through all that and try to get out of there, so that
SOB Created a backstory ""script"" And paid a lot of actors to help him make his exit. 

 ""where is he now? that's what I like to know.
Kind of reminds me of Michael Jackson in the helicopter following his death? 
- Where is he now? 

There is no question that a guy with that kind of money, and power and command of the medical community could have such bad CPR and basically seems to have vanished. 

I think it's more telling that one guy went right (BT), the shooter (not LNM) went left and the woman ""witness"" CBA went through the middle yet didn't spill a drop of coffee and even got a subtle ""nod"" From the shooter, the nuance is in the gesture of the gun that sort of gracefully waves. You can go now to indicate to her it's time for her to exit the scene. I watch that video a dozen times, and studied his arm, and how that gone slightly wave to the right with a slight delay as he angled towards her in a non-harmful, nonthreatening manner gesturing you need to go now. Watch it for yourself - slow it down and WATCH.

- Never mind all of the staging, the monopoly money in the backpack, the different colored, backpacks and the numerous methods of transportation, which make no sense at all in the subway, on a bike, in a taxi, on a bus ...

All The way to all tuna, lol Alltoona... Sounds like a fishing ( phishing ) operation. Like laughing in your face in a McDonald's. So The person of interest from ""on the Hook"" Is found in ""Altoona"" - And has a backpack with real cash in it, so what he's not a drug dealer and the guy likes to travel he was in Hawaii had a lot of friends there - What person with money would want to have to find an ATM if you really like to just go to places as beautiful as Hawaii you need to bring the cash with you and be a total free spirit. And well yes it's probably a good idea to have a gun. If you're gonna have that much cash and you don't know where you're going to end up because you like to be a free spirit because the world is not a safe place. Why was L and M chosen to be the person of interest? 

- Maybe LNM had a presence on the Internet, and he was tracked by the bad actors, smurfs hired by Brian, the hackers, the facilitators, the procurement agents, especially the pentesters and the like connected to his inside trading operation. 
- They certainly needed a fall guy. 
- And then we have the king of crime, Adams mayor of New York, trying to get pardoned for bribery that's just priceless! Getting his 15 minutes of fame, leading the brigade, with that beautiful movie, poster image of LNM, amidst the haze of the men in black as enforcement officers, taking him in like he had single handedly killed an entire city. Jeff Dahmer, with his phenomenal number of victims and heinous cannibalism certainly wasn't shackled like that. Look at him in orange looking gay, relaxed and free to move.

I've also read that the Engraved bullets found on the ground, the three of them, we're actually not shell casings. They were complete bullets. That detail I do not know so ok - there were three, there were three people and it's Deny, Delay, Depose - whatever - 
the title of a book ... how ""stylin' is that! 

-This all seems to be a little ""too planned"" to have engraved bullets etc. I believe like someone with money did it and when the scheme is a little bit too designed Like oh geez, we thought of everything - It's like a video game with many players. Many people involved to get Brian, the fuck out of there - He sure wouldn't be the first person to stage his own death, and he certainly would have complete control of anybody in ANY hospital and ANY cop any ANY EMT and ""anybody"" !!! 

- Those bullets shot could've been blanks?
- Were there bullets found inside his body? 
- Where are they? 
- Who is the corner? 
- Wayne Carver, the corner for Sandy Hook, interestingly dies of natural causes, and there's not a lot of detail on exactly how he died and what exactly were the natural causes. 
- Obituary - check out this interesting book I came across that was done by someone researching the New York obits, and writing about them. It was my belief that the person who is responsible for the book did this research to get into the obituary database, basically for the purposes of corruption and manipulation certainly not an intellectual with an unbiased, uncorruptible interest in death. 

- I N S U R A N C E .. That's what this is about

- Think about the pay out on an insurance policy for a $10 million guy. 
- who wouldn't want the guy dead ""every beneficiary would"" and they would absolutely not care where we ended up. 
- He wouldn't even have to die. He would just have to go somewhere else and never be seen again and then, of course there's always AI, and of course plastic surgery. 
- there's so many reasons that this guy could totally vanish and have plenty of money to live another life. He could be drinking without any concern for driving.",8,1736270007.0,LuigiMangioneJustice,1,1.0,False

1hvw8us,https://www.reddit.com/r/TextMarketing/comments/1hvw8us/the_5second_rule_for_text_marketing_a/,The 5-Second Rule for Text Marketing: A Game-Changing Strategy You Haven't Tried,"Here‚Äôs an unconventional tip for text marketing that can instantly improve your response rates: **Send your text campaigns during micro-breaks.**

What does that mean? People naturally check their phones during short pauses in their day‚Äîwaiting for coffee, in between meetings, or right before bed. Instead of blasting texts during the ‚Äúobvious‚Äù times like lunch or early morning, target these **unexpected moments** when people are most likely to be distracted and looking for quick wins.

# How to execute:

1. **Timing the breaks**
   * Experiment with sending texts **5 minutes before the hour** (e.g., 10:55 AM or 2:55 PM). People subconsciously prepare for the top of the hour by checking their phones.
   * Or, try sending at **offbeat times** like 8:47 PM, when someone might be winding down their day.
2. **Make it bite-sized**
   * Keep your text short enough that someone can read and take action in **5 seconds or less**. A simple CTA like: *""Get $5 off for the next 30 minutes: \[Link\]""* creates urgency and fits within their micro-moment.
3. **Track and refine**
   * Use A/B testing to figure out the micro-break windows that work best for your audience. This might vary depending on your demographic‚Äîstudents might have different patterns than working professionals.

# Why it works:

You‚Äôre catching people **at their most impulsive moments**, not when they‚Äôre overwhelmed or distracted by typical routines. Text marketing is about **interrupting with purpose**, and hitting these micro-breaks makes your message feel more natural, like it‚Äôs arriving at just the right time.

But the Goddess Squad members all clearly had disparate lives before their conversion that likely had nothing to do with fairy tails (it's unlikely any of them so much as met before being made to work together due to sheer talent for killing raptures).

Sugar mentions having a different squad before her current one in Dirty Backyard, and those three are pretty clearly a rag-tag group that aren't likely to be named for coffee given their shady backgrounds.

This makes even sense when you look at Blanc and Noir, who make a degree of sense to be theme-named as sisters, but then you throw in Rouge and Jaune (currently unseen) who carry the same French theme naming.

I feel like only Underworld Queen would have consistent names since their being NIKKE is being kept a secret from their own organizations. The same might be true for the members of Triangle, since Privaty keeps her status as a NIKKE hidden.

I have gradually updated parts of my gear one by one, learning about each aspect slowly: beans(development/origin/process), grind size(grinder), kettles(goosnecks), pouring method etc..probably in that order. The original packaging for V60 had come with a pack of the factory filters (40), which I soon ran out off so I got a 3 pack bundle of the Hario brand (pink) V60 02 filters which I had been using till now.

Seeing that I was about to run out, I ordered myself a pack of Cafec Abaca and T-90 filters thanks to the discourse on this sub, YouTube and also Dr. Gagne's book! I tried the Abaca for the first time today, and here are my two takeaways:

1. They definitely fit the V60 02 better, more snug than the Hario filters, and this is not due to lack of trying (Someone pointed this out on the sub recently, I couldn't find the original post)  
2. Yes the drawdown is quicker, sure, but also it's a much clearer brew (less suspended fines) for the same coffee and same grind size, everything else being equal. Truly a better job at trapping fines. 

I made the same coffee (washed Uganda) at the same grind size (5 on a ZP6) and got a distinctly different cup on the two filters. They were both enjoyable in their own way, but different nonetheless. It was an eye-opening moment to the effect of change of filters for the brew for me, and I just wanted to share that. Have a good one! :)",2,1736269704.0,pourover,3,1.0,False

1hvw7vt,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1hvw7vt/aita_for_cutting_off_my_boyfriends_childhood/,AITA for cutting off my boyfriend's childhood friends?,"Hi Charlotte! I love your videos and have been watching you for a good while now. Sorry in advance, but this will be a LONG one. Get your tea ready. Names have been changed.
So, me (24f) and my boyfriend (24m) have been together for about 3 years and living together for 2. But, we've known each other for almost 13 years, as his family and mine are super close, and we were friends as kids (and I had a huge crush on him). As such, we are very open in communication with each other and are completely honest (sometimes too honest) about everything we do. My boyfriend, we will call him Todd, has a very small circle of friends he has known since grade school. We will call them Michael (25m), Aiden (25m), and Arnold (25m). Now, some background on these guys:
- Todd knew Michael from school, and after graduation they got very close, and formed what I would call an ""inseparable bond""
- Todd knew Aiden and Arnold from going to church, and reconnected with them after graduation as well
- Arnold and Aiden went into the military right after high school, and now they are both back in the states
- Arnold is married, and at the beginning of this, Michael is engaged and Aiden is single
I met all of these men once I'd been dating Todd for a few weeks, and he introduced them to me as his family (important for later). 
After a year, Todd and I moved into a very nice place in a city where we were both working full time, but we were an hour away from all of our friends, including this group of guys. Once we moved, things started to change. Michael got fired from his high paying job and he and his fiance had to move out of their luxury apartment and into a not so nice rent-a-room, and then his fiance quit her job almost immediately after that. Neither of them were working, and it didn't seem apparent that either of them wanted to work (especially when her wealthy parents began paying for everything for them). 
Aiden is currently living with his parents, and getting disability checks from the military, so he also does not work, and he doesn't pay any bills. He started dating Arnold's sister, Megan, who is 6 years younger than him, and also living at home. 
Now, Michaels fiance, we'll call her Susan, had already decided that she did not like Arnold, and therefore, Michael couldn't like him either (VERY bridezilla, if I've ever seen one). There was a situation in which the three of those couples went to dinner (Todd and I had to work) and afterwards she complained to Michael that Arnold was ""staring"" at her. After this, nothing Arnold did amused Michael. A few examples:
- Arnold and his wife came over to our apartment and we all joked in the group chat that he was taking his pants off (a call back to something Todd did at his place a while back) and Michael called Todd and said ""are you going to do anything about that?"" And Todd, who knew the situation, said ""well, it's not actually happening, and if it was, do you really think my girlfriend or his wife would allow that to happen?"" To which Michael responded ""well I just wouldn't let that happen to my girl"", just not accepting that it was a joke
- Arnold is playing games with all the guys, says some things, and Michael gets all upset and calls him an A hole to Todd behind his back
Then, after Aiden and Megan had been together for a few months, he, Michael, and Todd went out to a bar one night for a guys hangout. For context, we all use an app that allows us to talk to each other while also gaming or doing other things. My boyfriend and his friends love video games, and I like to watch them play while doing my homework (going to school to be a nurse). I rarely ever interact or interrupt the game at all, I just like to bond with Todd over the games he plays. At the bar, the guys told Todd that they had an issue with me being on ""all the time"". Turns out, it wasn't them who had the problem with it, it was Susan and Megan. And the reason for it? They thought it was weird that I wanted to hang out with the guys all the time, but whenever the girls asked to hang out, I always canceled. Now mind you, the only time they ever actually invited me to something, I said yes, and there was no planning involved to get something started. I also was working 2 jobs and going to school full time, and I do a lot of the main house chores (Todd helps where he can, but since he makes the most money and takes care of me very well, I take care of him by tending to the home). So I'm not just gonna drop everything, drive an hour or so there (it could be more with traffic) to hang out for a few hours to drive back through traffic for another hour. Again, none of these four worked (Michael, Susan, Megan, and Aiden), all of them had all day to do whatever they want, and yet it was Todd and I who had to fit into ""their schedule"". We constantly had to drive up there, and if we asked them to drive to us or meet in the middle, they made up several excuses as to why they couldn't do that. 
So, the last time we drove up there, we were meeting at a restaurant for dinner, and Michael had said he put a reservation for the table. Todd and I had just gotten off of work, and drove over an hour to be there, only to find out that not only were we the only ones there, but there was no reservation. So we had to put our names down, wait for the others to get there (they all lived 5 minutes away from this place, which is why they picked it), and then wait again for the table to be ready. Todd and I are starving at this point, and we both like this restaurant, so we're both super excited to get to the table to eat. We hang out, everyone seems to enjoy themselves, and then we leave and go get ice cream. After leaving the ice cream shop, the guys go off to talk to each other, leaving me with the girls. We'd been talking for a good few minutes, and then Todd angrily grabbed his things and told me we were leaving. I was confused but went with him anyway, because he's never done that before while with our friends. When we got to the car, he told me what happened. 
Aiden accused Todd of trying to flirt and get with Megan, meaning he was accusing him of trying to cheat on me. Again, the only time he's been around her is when all of us are together, including me. Which means he was accusing him of trying to cheat right in front of me! 
The reason this is so outlandish and why Todd had a severe reaction to it is because Todd's parents spilt up because of cheating, and it broke their family apart. It's a very serious accusation to him, and both Aiden and Michael knew that, and instead of speaking to him about Aiden's own insecurities, they did that. Don't get me wrong, Todd is a very attractive and charming man, if he wanted someone other than me, he could have them. But we both know that neither of us are going anywhere, we are in this thing for life. Plus, Todd loves me because I'm driven and passionate (among other things), and this girl still lives at home, has no job, has no passions, and is currently mooching off of Aiden. So no, Todd has no interest in her whatsoever. After this crazy accusation, Todd told both Michael and Aiden to let us take a step back for a bit, and to give us some space. He told them not to contact him or me until we were ready to talk to them, or they were ready to apologize for what they had said. 
A few weeks later, it's my birthday. Michael sends me a happy birthday text that I read but ignore, because as much as I appreciate well wishes on my birthday, we had meant what we said: please don't text us. After I left him on read, he proceeded to send me a long paragraph summarizing the conversation the boys had, and this is what he said: 
""Hey, I‚Äôll keep this short, I assume Todd gave you some explanation for his behavior the other day and it seems like it may have made us look bad. I‚Äôm not asking you to disagree with him or go against him, I just want to briefly explain, in short, Aiden and I confronted him for his issue of flirting and commenting on other woman, especially his flirting with Megan, and he got angry. I‚Äôll only give examples if you ask, though, I imagine you can think of a few on your own. I want to reiterate that this isn‚Äôt to make him look bad, I'm just clearing my own name. Anyway, I‚Äôm sorry for the drama, I should‚Äôve waited for this to be not on your birthday, huge jackass move, sorry about that.""
So now, it's not only him trying to flirt with Megan, but other women as well, and he said ""I'm sure you can come up with a few examples on your own"", meaning he's doing this with me and I'm aware of him ""trying to cheat on me""! What the heck! That's so incredibly disrespectful of me, especially because I am an outspoken redhead from the south. If there is something happening, I will not hesitate to call it out. After he sent that, I blocked him, and he proceeded to text me on a different platform, saying something along the lines of ""so you're siding with him?"" Like I would do anything but stand by my man, when he's actually done nothing wrong. I blocked him on there as well, still haven't responded to him at all, and he and Susan message the group chat we had on Instagram, and Susan said ""wow guys, real mature, it's called communication, I'm so disappointed we can't be adults about this."" To which Michael said ""yeah, definitely praying for you two and your relationship""
Todd blocked them both on everything, still not saying a word, but I'd had enough. I sent them a very long message explaining to them my stance on the matter, telling them both off for being drama starters because they have nothing better to do with their time than to sit on their butts and create problems out of nothing. Blocked them both, on everything, and haven't heard from them since.
 I found out later than Michael tried to get in touch with Todd through three different social media apps, texting, and he EMAILED him, all increasingly nasty messages, saying how bad of a person Todd is. Todd never responded to any of this, and the last message Michael sent to him said ""I'm glad people are finally seeing your true colors and how bad of a person you really are."" So, had he been pretending all these years to like Todd?? 
Fast forward to a few months later, Todd and I are talking about the whole thing, and he said that Michael had told him in confidence before the situation, while they were still in the luxury apartment, that he was so tempted by the other women in that city, because all of them were ""more attractive than his fiance"", and he honestly wanted to ditch her to ""explore his options"". He also had a huge p*rn addiction, and since he was unemployed, he would do that every day when Susan was still working. Then, Michael's old girlfriend texted him and instead of saying ""no I have a fiance"" he proceeded to text and chat with this girl, flirting and leading her on, not letting Susan know about it. When the old girlfriend asked him to go for some coffee, he said no I have a fiance. And Todd had asked him why he didn't just say that in the first place to avoid any kind of temptation and Michael said ""I wanted to lead her on to break her heart later"". So, the person accusing Todd for wanting to get with someone else's girlfriend, not even his fiance or his situation, was the one actually trying to cheat! Projection much?
We haven't spoken to any of them since, and have completely cut them all off, except for Arnold and his wife, who, after hearing about what Michael and Susan did on my birthday, invited us over to their house to surprise me with a cake they made for me. 
So, are we the a hole for cutting them off? Am I the a hole for calling them out and telling them they were lazy bums who had nothing better to do? 
Update: Todd and I are getting new jobs with better pay, he's going to be a project manager for a law firm, and I'll be doing hospital work to gain experience for school. Michael and Susan are being kicked out of their rent-a-room, which is crazy because they were renting from one of his family members. Makes you think how bad of a tenant you can be when you don't even live in the same space as the other people and they still kick you out. Also, Aiden lost $30,000 in an investment that Todd told him repeatedly not to invest in. Karma! ",1,1736269659.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,1.0,False

I wanted to thank you all for this subreddit. It‚Äôs been useful to read the stories of others with sleep apnea. I still haven‚Äôt been diagnosed, but I am very hopeful that I will be diagnosed. I just took a sleep test last week and I am waiting on the results. Otherwise, I don‚Äôt know what could be causing my problems. I have been exhausted for ‚Ä¶ as long as I can remember. I‚Äôm sure that I had more energy as a kid or a younger adult, but I still remember feeling like I could fall asleep in the middle of high school classes. In the last ~5 years it‚Äôs become obvious to me that the cause of most of my problems (lack of motivation) is feeling tired. I usually wake up feeling exhausted and force myself to get up and go to work. I function fine during the day, but I also drink a lot of coffee to help me focus. When I get home from work, I walk my dog and then I‚Äôm basically too mentally-drained to do anything else. I don‚Äôt have the motivation to work on my hobbies or go out and socialize. Every day, I tell myself that I will accomplish more today, but that rarely happens. Over the years, I‚Äôve been to many specialists and gotten tested for almost everything. I do have a couple autoimmune diseases but nothing that would seem to explain why I am this tired. Around this time, I started seeing blood test results that were ‚Äúnormal‚Äù but still seemed strange to me. My doctor kept telling me that I was dehydrated, but I drink more water than anyone I know. There is no way that I have been dehydrated for 5 years. After looking into this more, I started suspecting that sleep apnea may be the cause of my problems. I saw a sleep specialist who told me that I have a Mallampati score of 4, meaning I have increased risk of OSA. So, I took the sleep test and feel like it was a pretty normal night of sleep for me. I‚Äôm looking forward to the path ahead and hoping to feel like a normal human soon.

So, last week, I was at a coffee shop near my house, just minding my business, trying to get some work done. It was a typical day, not expecting anything out of the ordinary.

But then, this random guy walks up to me. I don‚Äôt know him, never seen him before, but he seems oddly familiar. He stops, looks at me for a second, and says, ‚ÄúYou look like someone I used to know. I‚Äôm not sure from where, but it feels like we‚Äôve met before.‚Äù I laugh it off, trying to brush it off as just one of those weird encounters, right? But then, he leans in a little closer and says, ‚ÄúNo, seriously. You‚Äôre the exact person I saw in a dream last night.""

At this point, I‚Äôm a little freaked out, but I try to play it cool. I tell him that I think he‚Äôs mistaken, and that we‚Äôve never met, and he apologizes and walks away, clearly a little embarrassed. But the weird part is that I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that there was something *off* about it.

Later that night, I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about what he said. I started wondering if it was some sort of weird coincidence or if I was just overthinking it. I even tried Googling stuff about ‚Äúdreams about strangers‚Äù or anything that could explain it, but honestly, it didn‚Äôt really make sense. I haven‚Äôt seen him since, but I keep replaying the conversation in my head, wondering if it was just some bizarre coincidence or something more.

It was such a random, strange interaction, and it‚Äôs honestly left me a little creeped out. Has anyone else had a moment like this where a random encounter stuck with you for no reason? What do you think?

It‚Äôs weird to me because a lot of people with ocd or an anxiety disorder say that caffeine makes it so much worse for them, but it always makes me feel better and think more clearly. Granted, I‚Äôve only been up for a few hours, so I may crash and burn later.

1hvvqej,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectronicsRepair/comments/1hvvqej/opening_led_microcontroller/,Opening LED Microcontroller,"Hello there,

I received this ""Coffee"" light as a christmas gift: [https://www.amazon.de/SIGNSHIP-Kaffee-Leuchtreklamen-LED-Wand-Neonlicht-Leuchtreklame-Wanddekoration/dp/B09TQV2VY4](https://www.amazon.de/SIGNSHIP-Kaffee-Leuchtreklamen-LED-Wand-Neonlicht-Leuchtreklame-Wanddekoration/dp/B09TQV2VY4)

Unfortunately, there is no ID I can provide here.

My plan was to pair the light with a movement detector, so that it goes on whenever someone enters the room. However, the light needs to be actively switched on, whenever the power went off. Therefore, a switch before the actual device does not work. Additionally, the microcontroller enables me to modulate the brightness, but it always resets once disconnected from energy. Notably, it remembers the last setting when it stays connected and is switched off via the microcontroller.

Since I am stubborn enough and want to realize my idea, can someone with knowledge help and tell me whether it is possible to open the switch in the picture and circumvent the on/off switch without cutting the whole thing out? Ideally, I would love to keep the latest brightness setting, but I guess that makes things a lot more complicated.

  
Writing this, I realize that I simply need a finger bot that reacts to movement, but I guess those are not available. I am grateful for every input you can give me!

No, seriously, I would practice every day for hours that the motions became second nature. My mother would beam with pride about how hard I worked. She‚Äôd brag to all her friends that I could tap as good as Donald O‚ÄôConnor in my sleep.

   Sometimes, well past my bedtime, I would be wide awake, laying horizontal in bed, kicking my feet under the sheets to mark the moves for my upcoming performances.

   However, time and family responsibilities took me away from it, and I haven‚Äôt tap danced in at least 10 years. I always thought that I‚Äôd get back into it. I just never really found the time.

   Well, today that changed. I was walking out of the coffee place around the corner from my apartment, like every Saturday. As I stepped from the curb down to the sidewalk, I was blindsided by a teenager who was texting and driving in a new Chevy pickup. As the people gathered around my blood and coffee covered body, I was horrified to realize I couldn‚Äôt even control my mouth or throat to scream. No, instead I laid there silently as the white-hot pain radiated off of every molecule of me.

   Instead of my own screams, I could hear whispered murmurs of shock emanating amongst the crowd. From the eye that was still able to open (possibly the only eye remaining), I saw their looks of horror as they watched my legs in disbelief. Tears began to sting my eyes as my dying brain sent long dormant signals to the misshapen bags of blood and bone at the end of my legs to fa-lap and shuffle ball change. Marking a dance I thought was long forgotten.

   If only my mother could see me now: a tap-dancing corpse, just like Donald O‚ÄôConnor.",4,1736268457.0,shortscarystories,0,0.84,False

I read into this ""company"" she started: https://prettyandsmartco.com/

I find the premise of this blog cringe in itself. None of the contributors are in STEM fields that are male dominated or fields that are considered intellectually challenging. Everyone here is a social media manager, model, event planning or some profession that is not what you would commonly consider intelligence to be associated with. Not saying intelligence is limited to those in STEM, but the majority of these contributors (including Ana) fall under that stereotype of millennial moms who make being a mommy their identity and who think drinking/coffee wine is a personality trait.

I'm heavily critiquing this because the name ""pretty and smart"" is Ana's instagram handle. For a second I thought she was some type of engineer or lawyer.

Ana states this as her favourite quote: ""Only thing more beautiful than the woman that knows what she wants, is the woman who isn‚Äôt waiting on anybody else to get it for her.""

Aside from obtaining her undergrad and marrying her husband, what has she accomplished independently? What successful companies has she started(she describes herself as an entrepreneur)? What was her activism like BEFORE she was used as a political pawn by her husband? Seems a bit egotistical to portray herself as some type of Girl Boss

We started off as FwB but soon realized it was more than that. I have gone through a really difficult phase in my life where whatever I had build professionally has been destroyed. Meaning, I have to start from the bottom. This is taken a toll on my mental health as my relatives never leave a chance to taunt me on this. My bf and I stay together. My mom has helped me in chunks financially and my partner is the primary and sole provider for us. I respect him for what he is doing. The problem is whenever there is an argument between us, he never starts to have a conversation. He is just not ready to agree that there can be two opinions under a same roof. I do the household chores and he has a job. I am mentally and physically exhausted. While I realize that our time has to run according to his schedule but I have to stop everything and be behind him, cleaning after him, cooking all day for him. Initially, I did all that I could to show my gratitude. I try to keep things clean so it doesn‚Äôt pile up. Whenever I maintain the house, if he wants to find something, he scatters it all and expects me to clean it. 

Recently we moved houses, I am pregnant and I am feeling nauseous and really weak. I couldn‚Äôt contribute much but did my part. Our stuff was in the garage and he asked me to arrange it till he comes back home. He was out for 3 days for work. My health deteriorated and I couldn‚Äôt sleep due to nausea and headache for 2 days and 1 night. I told him the same. When he came back, he didn‚Äôt react to it but at breakfast he wanted coffee and I said I couldn‚Äôt find it, he got upset and left for some work. I texted him that I do not think it‚Äôs healthy for our relationship if he gets mad over small things. As soon as he realizes something is not done from my side, he acts like a complete stranger. He doesn‚Äôt let me close to him or either touch him. Nor he responds to what I am saying. He always says I take things forward in my head and it‚Äôs always my mistake. That I always be on my phone all day. I don‚Äôt know what to do. Am I overthinking because of my past relationship experiences or what he is expecting from me is normal?

I have never been in a relationship where you keep distancing yourself rather than having a conversation. I believe that even if out of anger, things were said, we can always look past that. He doesn‚Äôt believe in this. According to him Whatever I say comes off as a result of my overthinking. Also he never lets me get mad, rather finds a way to get mad at me and all of a sudden he makes me think that I am the crazy one. He doesn‚Äôt like to talk to me even if he has to go away for a week. I feel it‚Äôs important to solve an issue first, knowing you won‚Äôt see each other the whole week. It just feels weird to me. He wants to change me according to his conservative family. Even my family is conservative but I don‚Äôt expect my partner to change himself . I don‚Äôt have a problem changing my lifestyle to be honest but if you do all sorts of things that your family doesn‚Äôt approve of, then how can you ask me to ? I asked him to find someone perfect for him because I come with my own set of flaws. 

I asked him if he thinks I am not allowed to have an opinion because I don‚Äôt contribute much financially and he says that‚Äôs not the case. I asked him if he thinks I am a burden on him and he says no. What could be the problem here? ",2,1736268369.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

(UK),"To preface this, I‚Äôve only been working at McDonald‚Äôs for about three months, but already I‚Äôm noticing that people who have been there longer than me (or at the very least the same amount of time as me) seem to be less capable.

Not really physically less capable, just less willing to do their part and because of that, everyone else‚Äôs tasks become way harder.

For example, there‚Äôs one girl at my work who never gives the drive thru customers their drinks when she parks them. She‚Äôs been there a lot longer than me and literally everybody - every single one of the managers - says to never park cars without drinks as it‚Äôs hell for the park runner (often we only have one park runner if that). But this girl, despite myself and others asking several times, just will not hand drinks out. We could not make it any clearer. Once, I even made the drink myself despite it being her responsibility, and I put it down on the counter on top of the receipt before the car even reached the window, and I said, ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the car‚Äôs drink.‚Äù Still, she didn‚Äôt give it out. She actively moved it off the receipt in order to write their number plate down. Literally what is the reason for this? It seems like pure laziness.

Another coworker of mine, a guy who started on the exact same day as me, has only been trained on present and park running. He is always complaining about lack of training but just isn‚Äôt receptive to anything I or anyone else shows him. I taught this guy how to clean the coffee machines and midway through he just walked away to sweep the floor. Okay, whatever, but during this shift, I was balancing top window, front, drinks, and all the cleaning. It was a night shift so only the two of us down front but what was supposed to be a 50/50 split (one window each, half half the cleaning and bagging, me taking orders and him making drinks), was more like a 90/10 split with me doing the most. 

It had gotten to the point where he was saying he didn‚Äôt know how to pour hot drinks, I explained literally 10+ times that it‚Äôs just grabbing the right cup and pushing one or two buttons for the most part, and still he ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt know.‚Äù I‚Äôd like to add that this guy was born and raised in the UK so it wasn‚Äôt a language barrier issue. When drive thru picked up at about 4am, if I was taking an order or payment or deep cleaning something, this guy would come up to me and say, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a cappuccino on screen.‚Äù Again, I would show him how to make it, and make sure he was watching me do it, but the next time a drink came through he just told me about it. Additionally, when it was quiet and I was pointing out cleaning tasks to be done, he would just stay on present and stare at the empty screen. 

I‚Äôm not really sure what the issue is with people like this. In both cases, there was no language barrier, and they were being told very clearly what needs to be done, they would say, ‚Äúthank you‚Äù or, ‚Äúokay‚Äù after receiving instructions and then just blatantly not follow through. 

Sometimes, even the managers would be doing both kitchen and front when these people were standing doing nothing and I was busy at the top window, and they‚Äôd be yelling to these people that they need to help out, and STILL they didn‚Äôt. Things only started moving when I came down from the top to help out and catch up.

Has anyone else had a coworker like this? And was there anything at all that made them help out? ",6,1736268014.0,McDonaldsEmployees,0,1.0,False
1hvvjxi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1hvvjxi/conflicting_endoscopy_and_barium_swallow_reuslts/,Conflicting Endoscopy and Barium Swallow Reuslts,"Hello i had random vomitting of blood recently and was hospitalised over Xmas with low hb and low hct.
The blood at first was bright red then towards the end like coffee granuals.

I was in hospital for 4 days.

I had an endoscopy that said they found a 2cm sliding hiatal hernia but that didn't explain vomiting blood so I need to have another in 2 months, however i had a Barium Swallow test the day after which said i didn't have a Hernia and instead had

Mild extrinsic compression of the upper oesophagus at the level of the aortic arch. Appearances are in keeping with vascular compression from a possible aberrant subclavian artery.

Again nobody has explained if this could have caused the bleeding or not.

The barium swallow test was sent to GP but endoscopy wasnt so i feel like there's a lap of communication and if dont know who is in charge to deal with this as Hospital ordered Endoscopy and GP ordered Barium.

My records now also says i have Anemia - other. But there has been little communication as to what happens next?

I was reffered to Hemotology in June last year with a DVT in my leg but was told the waiting list (UK) was over a year. Since my hospitalisation they have bumped it to Febuary this year- but again i think that's to discuss the DVT and treatment and not the anemia or vomitting blood?

1hvvib1,https://youtu.be/tSJhfYHT3_U?si=uWZTG_m1ZZ_HPTGy,Sousou No Frieren x Guardian Tales has officially started. Few tips for those who are returning.,"If you get Frieren and are out of summons dont spend money on the weapon pulls, the 18$ pass gives the colab gacha weapon as the final reward.

For those returning here is what changed:

Every game mode now has its own presets, that means that gear isnt shared between game-modes , you can use the same gear on different characters across different game-modes.

Kamazone and world exploration is gone. You now get merch from the coop-expedition and tetis shop.

Expedition is no longer grindable, now its one time clear for the highest score as well as one time rewords for the said score. You get relics from the coop expedition shop.

Expedition co-op is what you will grind once or few times a day (there is no tower defense coop anymore cuz it was terrible and this coop mode can be llayed any time during the day).

Whats important to note is that you get an additional active skill in this mode based on your role, healer gets a heal spell that dispells the ""poison"" that will kill your team if you dont regularly use this skill on them, and tank gets a shield skill that blocks attacks like a wall.

There are two additional upgrades to heroes and weapons, one uses 15 blue books par hero upgrade and max are 3 upgrades, this gives your hero 25% atk and 25% hp.
Weapons that are max engraved using copies or hammers can now be hammered an editional time for 15% atk and 15% def and an editional random stat.

And now for the main dish, the new game mode tetis that is an auto tower defense mode, you pretty much just sweep and burn coffie on the first 20 easy levels to be able to clear the rest, cuz the rest requre the final node on the upgrade tree. So this is what you burn coffee on if you have lots of maxed characters. Its honestly bad but it doesnt take time or brainpower just look at some guide on yt.

My dream started with me and Mariah standing by a lake.  She said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs swim to that spot‚Äù and so I jumped in.  I followed but I suddenly remembered there could be sharks and so I swam a small distance more to a dock.  Mariah vanished and I heard a voice say it was time to go.  I don‚Äôt remember if things flashed black but I was gone for a second and then re-appeared on the dock.  Things looked different and more wavy, like everything was alive with energy flowing endlessly.  I looked at the water again and it was crystal clear, I looked for sharks and saw none‚Ä¶.

We arrived as guests in a home, a man and woman greeted us, it felt like some sort of gathering and like there were more people somewhere‚Ä¶next I remember I was in a room with a snake eating another snake about the same size in a cage.  I had seen the cage before and felt like I had once stood in that very cage.  I went into the kitchen and the table was full of raw meat products.  I ran upstairs and I think I was given something to make me fall into a deep sleep because I awoke feeling like I had been asleep for forever.  The gathering or the people who were all once here before were now all gone.  Things felt off and wrong, someone tried to get into the room a few times but the door was locked.  I climbed out onto the roof outside my window.  I saw a woman in the distance who had her back to me and she was performing some ritual.  I climbed off of the roof to investigate the woman.  She was gone but I found a massacred horse that had been ripped into 3-4 sections.  I searched for the woman but to no avail, instead I found the lower half of the horse.  I started back towards the house and once on the porch I looked back and saw the same woman in the distance.  Suddenly and quickly a jeep drives in and rams up and over the horse‚Äôs body as if they didn‚Äôt even see it in the path.  Another car follows and does the same, I turn to get my things to leave and the next thing I knew I was back in the room with my the snake cage.  I was now talking with the woman and the man from the beginning of my dream about how we all needed to help each other now.  I woke up.

I was in a big city, outside of a building and looking out onto a pier.  Suddenly someone yelled out that it was an emergency but like ‚Äúit‚Äôs a code 37!‚Äù I ran into the building to my left and started following a crowd into the indoor pool area.  A woman got up and said ‚Äúthere is a miracle pick up on 3rd, I think I can still make it!‚Äù  Everyone begged her not to but she walked out of these two metal doors, looked to her right and through her eyes I saw light that resembled a fire ball, consuming bodies of people.  I saw through my eyes again and as the metal doors closed on the woman and the screams from outside were muffled.  I looked at the people around me and I was concerned.  Suddenly I was picked up by a robot Abraham Lincoln (LMAO, I‚Äôm rolling at myself for this one ü§£ü§£ü§£) and he carried me while I was watching in third person and I was carrying a bucket of beans between my legs (wtf üôÉüòÇ) and I told him we needed to go get two other people. He agreed and so we went walking down towards a river.  We came to a split in the river.  I saw robo Abe going right and so I jumped out and swam to the shoreline.  Robo Abe asked me what I was doing and I told him that AJ said I needed to go left because the right river gets too rough.  I awoke.

I watched someone at the bottom of a mountain and they started to climb it.  They wanted to get over their fear and I somehow I just knew this instinctively.  When they got to the top I became the person who had been climbing.  I felt the rocks under my hands and feet and looked out at how high up I was; I saw where I climbed from and looked towards where I could go.  I started to walk towards to edge and I could see a cabin in the distance.  The rocks started to crumble under my feet but they fell in a manner that helped me get to where I wanted to go‚Ä¶I reached out to catch myself and I was on the other side - my hands dug into the ground and I pulled myself up.

This one I remembered without journaling actively‚Ä¶my dream switched scenes multiple times but can remember two moments with the most detail

I‚Äôm at a house I‚Äôve visited before in my dreams but I don‚Äôt know where this place is consciously.  I was walking out of master bedroom and look over to my significant other who was sleeping in bed, I couldn‚Äôt see their face, only the shape of their body in the bed but I knew we were together‚Ä¶I walked onto balcony and started looking at large full moon in sky.  Suddenly moon starts to develops black oil like spots all over it until it completely covered.  A red rocket ship comes in and lassoed the moon with a red glowing rope and drug the moon away‚Ä¶

Next dream/same night:
I‚Äôm outside watching various people experience something‚Ä¶so there would be two people at a time that I would see, cropped at their shoulders and up, pairs of people,  watching something beautiful and standing in awe, their faces would glow with light and colors from whatever they were viewing.  With each pair the lighting and colors would change so I knew whatever was being looked at was changing but the awe struck expressions remained.  Several pairs of people passed before I turned to see for myself what was being looked at..I saw a beautiful sunset with a sky full of colors and scenery that seemed to draw the attention towards the horizon (like railroad tracks coming to a point at the horizon line but all made from nature/mountains/trees/ect‚Ä¶) it was so beautiful.  I awoke.

I was in a church that was putting on a play, it didn‚Äôt seem super religious at first, they claimed they would help make your life better, etc.  There were these flashes of weirdness/people and things were glitching‚Ä¶I went to the parking lot and kissed a girl, she was a red head - there was a family of redheads hyper involved with church and she was in this family. I started to run away through huge church building, people and things were ‚Äúglitching‚Äù still‚Ä¶I was being chased by the red headed girl‚Äôs family‚Ä¶I passed through a chapel and the girl with red hair was spinning so so slowly on the stage, like a ballerina.  I ran out of the church and made it to a trans activism building and chaos erupted, shots fired, people started chasing me and a guy who was following me caught up to me and showed me the way out.  Once outside we caught our breaths and he told me he can see the glitches too and he thinks it‚Äôs past/future combination and they were essentially time slips/dimensional rips‚Ä¶then a taxi started chasing us, we had to get past the perimeter of the church block to be safe, once outside the block everything calmed.  The taxi started driving towards us down the street and I was scared but then it stopped and picked up a cat and drove off, no longer interested in chasing us.  The guy I was running from the church with explained it the strangeness only happens on that block, and he thinks it‚Äôs connected to the church.

Let‚Äôs dive into that awkward question no one¬†*really*¬†wants to ask themselves: ‚ÄúAm I just the life of the party, or is my relationship with alcohol looking a little... codependent?‚Äù

Here‚Äôs a fun checklist to help you figure it out:

# 1. Do you think about drinking... a lot?

Like, is alcohol living rent-free in your head? If you‚Äôre planning your Friday drinks on Monday, and your weekend schedule revolves around when and where Happy Hour starts, alcohol might be taking up more space in your life than your Netflix queue.

# 2. Can you stop at one drink?

One drink: ‚ÄúWow, this is nice!‚Äù  
Two drinks: ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm feeling good.‚Äù  
Seven drinks: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs book flights to Vegas and adopt a lizard together!‚Äù  
If ‚Äújust one‚Äù is about as realistic as finding a unicorn, it might be time to take a closer look.

# 3. Are your hangovers sending you passive-aggressive messages?

Sure, everyone‚Äôs had a rough morning after a wild night. But if your hangovers are less ‚Äúoops‚Äù and more ‚Äúweekly existential crisis,‚Äù your body is waving a red flag and screaming, ‚ÄúDUDE, HELP ME OUT!‚Äù

# 4. Do you need alcohol to¬†function?

If your mornings start with a drink, or you need a beer to ‚Äúrelax‚Äù after literally¬†*everything*¬†(like folding socks), it might not just be ‚Äúunwinding‚Äù anymore.

# 5. Are you hiding it?

If you‚Äôre pouring wine into a coffee mug to ‚Äúkeep it casual‚Äù or sneaking drinks like you‚Äôre in a spy movie, this isn‚Äôt just about keeping the fun going. This is about you and alcohol having a secret affair.

# 6. Is alcohol causing drama in your life?

Arguments with your partner? Missed work? That awkward time you told your boss you could ‚Äútotally run the company better‚Äù? If alcohol is the common denominator, maybe it‚Äôs time to re-evaluate.

# So... am I an alcoholic?

Look, I‚Äôm not a doctor, but here‚Äôs the thing: If you‚Äôre even¬†*asking*¬†this question, there‚Äôs probably something going on. Alcohol dependency doesn‚Äôt always look like a Hollywood movie. It‚Äôs sneaky. It starts with excuses like ‚Äújust one more‚Äù or ‚ÄúI deserve this‚Äù and ends with you wondering why your liver hates you.

# What should you do?

* **Talk to someone:**¬†A friend, a doctor, or even this community. You don‚Äôt have to figure it out alone.
* **Try a break:**¬†Can you go a week or two without drinking? If the idea of that makes you sweat, it‚Äôs worth exploring.
* **Be kind to yourself:**¬†Recognizing there‚Äôs a problem isn‚Äôt weak; it‚Äôs the bravest thing you can do.

Remember, Reddit, admitting you might have a problem isn‚Äôt the end of the fun ‚Äì it‚Äôs the start of something better. You can still be the life of the party, just maybe without the regret-flavored cocktails. And you might even remember what happened ;)

1hvveke,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/comments/1hvveke/aita_for_not_going_to_my_girlfriends_grandfathers/,AITA for not going to my girlfriend‚Äôs grandfather‚Äôs funeral on my birthday?,"For some context, my girlfriend has a troubled family situation. I don‚Äôt want to disclose her private matters, but essentially, everyone in her family is either deceased, elderly, very sick, or far away. When her grandfather became seriously ill, she had to step in and take him to the hospital for exams and checkups all day. After that, she had to bring him home and try to get him diagnosed the next day.  

One night, she was venting about how overwhelmed and alone she felt, and I felt guilty for not being there. I told her that after my Saturday class, I could accompany her to the hospital where her grandfather had finally been admitted. However, she told me it was okay‚Äîan aunt from out of town was helping, and they had the support they needed. To make up for not being there earlier, I bought her some gummies and drove her home (she was at work that morning). She was happy to see me, and I felt relieved because I thought she might be mad at me.  

On the 5th, it was my birthday. We had already agreed that we probably wouldn‚Äôt celebrate, but I still felt a little down about it. For some additional context, I don‚Äôt have any friends to invite out for my birthday. The only times I celebrated with people outside of my family were two years during my teens. The last birthday I celebrated, it was just me and my girlfriend. I mostly hang out with her or her and her friends, and she often says it‚Äôs my fault that I don‚Äôt have friends and I agree with her but I can‚Äôt wrap my head around me being mean to other people, to being odiosa like she says I am even with her.

So, I knew it was going to be a quiet birthday. My parents tried their best to cheer me up, and I was happy for a while until my dad told me we couldn‚Äôt go out to dinner, leaving me with nothing to do. My sister convinced me to go out for coffee and take some pictures, so I put on makeup and a cute dress. Just before I left, I got a text from my girlfriend saying her grandfather had passed away.  

I asked if it was okay to come over with makeup on, and she said it was fine. But the more I looked at myself, the more I felt stupid, overdone and selfish because I didn‚Äôt want to go. My sister suggested I go after we got coffee, but I felt guilty for even considering going out while my girlfriend was grieving. At the same time, I didn‚Äôt want to spend my entire birthday doing something so sad. I knew if I went, I would probably be there all day and night.  

I took off my makeup, grabbed my car keys, and was ready to leave without even knowing where she was. My mom stopped me, telling me I needed to find out where I was going first. She was asking a lot of questions and I couldn‚Äôt physically answer anything, I just stared at my keys in my hands barely moving, it‚Äôs something that happens sometimes. When my mom started to get critical of my relationship with her, I got out and went to my bed to cry some more.

I texted my girlfriend saying I wasn‚Äôt allowed to go. I cried a lot, thinking I had ruined everything and that I hadn‚Äôt been a good partner. I felt like I didn‚Äôt even meet the bare minimum of being a friend. I thought this was the reason I didn‚Äôt have anyone else in my life and that I would lose her too.  

Eventually, I calmed down and went downstairs. I just wanted to have cake and my sister reunited my family to light up the candles and sing. I didn‚Äôt talk to anyone about what I was feeling, just acted like nothing happened and my sister convinced me again to go out, and we did. I‚Äôm glad we did go out and took pictures because it cheered me up a bit.  

When I got home, I texted my girlfriend to check in. It was already midnight. She told me the funeral was happening but that they would bury him the next day. I told her to take care and went to sleep because there wasn‚Äôt much else I could do at that hour.  

The next day, I woke up late, and after lunch, my mom encouraged me to visit my girlfriend. I was relieved she gave her approval, so I got ready and texted my girlfriend asking, ‚ÄúAre you at your house?‚Äù She said yes, so I asked, ‚ÄúShould I come over?‚Äù She didn‚Äôt respond.  

An hour later, I sent her another message apologizing, saying I didn‚Äôt know how to handle these situations, and wishing her a calm day. I haven‚Äôt heard from her since.  

I feel terrible and think we might break up soon. AITA?",1,1736267624.0,AITA_Relationships,0,1.0,False

I have a consultation with a specialist later in the week, blood and urine tests next week. I am scared. I don't want to die young, you know? I feel like I just started living and so this is ‚ú®ironic‚ú®.

It's also my fault for not prioritising this sooner. I prioritised everyone and everything else, and this is on me for not taking it more seriously. I am kicking myself for not having a glass of fucking water in arm's reach all times.

So please, please, please ladies I beg of you, don't make my mistakes and please keep hydrated. Make it part of your routine. Don't put it off, no matter how tempting the side quest is, PLEASE DRINK WATER.


Edit: uh, well I'll be deleting this I guess since I'm being downvoted to heck for saying that drinking squash in place of water is not a substitute for water? And that it contributed to MY health issues? Lol.


And...I'm aware other factors can cause kidney failure. These issues however are the result of dehydration. It was my doing, I wish I had drank more water. That's literally it.",237,1736267307.0,adhdwomen,98,0.92,False

This whole thing is hugely affecting my mental health. I already suffer from severe anxiety (generalised but also health and dental) and depression. 

Has anyone managed to halt their disease progression? The look of my teeth is already awful and JUST about passable for me to carry on with. The thought of them getting worse is terrifying and I don't know how I'd manage. I'm so angry at myself for all of this.

At my last cleaning and check up I was told 'no pockets above a 3' but my recession looks awful. I am going to ask for him grafts (although expensive and terrifying in themselves). 

I'm UK based so everything is out of pocket as we don't have dental insurance here and NHS only do basic things.

Are there any cosmetic treatments that may improve teeth if the recession gets worse? I've seen gingival veneers but not sure if they're any good, or composite bonding? My teeth originally are quite small so I think if they were made bigger it wouldn't look weird.

Just looking for some hope really, it's eroding my mental health daily. 

Fyi:
Morning: rinse with xylitol mouthwash and Brush for at least 2 mins (usually 4) with sonicare toothbrush, leave toothpaste on.

Throughout day: floss after eating, waterfloss after eating if needed and after drinks like coffee.

Evening: interdental brush (size 1) on back molars and floss elsewhere, waterfloss and/or mouthrinse, brush 2 to 4 mins with sonicare leaving toothpaste on.

I'm a 24 year old female, and I have a 20 year old sister who is more like my first daughter to me. We‚Äôve always been best friends and grew even closer after I moved to another city for work. Despite the distance, we‚Äôve always stayed connected through video calls.

I‚Äôve always encouraged her to go out, explore the world, meet people, and make good decisions. She used to use Bumble occasionally and went on coffee dates, but she never really connected with anyone until she met a guy (20) in November. She started dating him, but by December, her best friend discovered some troubling things about him.  

It turned out he had dumped another girl to be with my sister, lied about never being in a relationship, and manipulated her into thinking he was innocent. Worse, we found out he has a sexual harassment case against him. When confronted, he initially claimed it was about money. However, after pressing further, he admitted to the case but said it was fake. Unfortunately, we couldn‚Äôt find proof to confirm whether it was true or not. There‚Äôs a 50-50 chance my sister is dating someone dangerous.

We explained everything to her, and she broke up with him. However, a week later, she got back together with him, saying she wants to give him another chance. I‚Äôm terrified she might get hurt physically. I can‚Äôt tell our parents because my father is physically and verbally abusive, and he would end up blaming both of us.

Please share your thoughts on what I can do to handle this situation.

TLDR:
My 20-year-old sister is dating a guy with a shady past, including a sexual harassment case. She broke up with him but got back together despite my concerns. I‚Äôm scared for her safety but can‚Äôt involve our abusive father. Need advice on what can I do in this situation? ",20,1736267109.0,TwoXIndia,5,0.86,False
