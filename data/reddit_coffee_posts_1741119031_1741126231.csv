Welcome my dear employees to another episode of *Vee-Accommodate*.  
  
The format for *you,* my dear people; since we also have a handful of new employees here at VoxTek Enterprises I wanted to remind everyone that this also means that you, my employees, may request topics to be covered.   
Anything that interests you, this format has been created to carter to *your* needs after all.  
  
Enough of the that – it has come to my attention that a few of you like to indulge in the **lifeblood** of the modern world, **coffee** .  
There’s nothing quite like it, is there? That first cup of the day, that surge of energy, the bitter punch that cuts through your mind’s fog like a hot knife through butter, and whatever other metaphors you want to come up with.  
Let me make one thing clear: Coffee is *essential* \- and like with all things, I do not settle for anything less than **perfection**.

**For the record:** I prefer my coffee **black**. None of those sugary, syrupy concoctions for me, no.   
I don’t need to mask the *bold*, *bitter* essence of the bean with cream, sugar, or worse - flavored nonsense.  
The beans must be **premium** \- nothing substandard will do. I am not some peasant sipping on *cheap*, watery brew. No, I demand the **best**.  
That is also why we have our rather luxurious coffee makers stationed around the offices - you may **all** indulge in the luxury of a *good* coffee too.

Prefer does not mean exclusive - I do not solely drink my coffee black.  
Occasionally, when the mood strikes (and when I’m feeling particularly *extravagant*), I indulge in the most **ridiculous** coffee combinations I can find.

Now, my dear employees, I’d like to know **your** preferences. Do you sip on the finest black coffee, or do you drown your drink in so much milk and sugar it’s practically a dessert?  
Do you even drink any coffee at all or do you have a substitution for it?

Age: 7
Female, spayed
Labrador Retriever, yellow
90lbs
No medical history we know of
Medications: Prozac 60 daily for anxiety x 5 years

My dog started having upper GI bleeding w/coffee ground emesis every other day for the last 10-13 days. Took her to the vet after the first couple of episodes which revealed normal CBC, chem panel, liver enzymes and negative amylase/lipase. No occult positive fecal test.  Normal and benign exam. Was started on cerinia and carafate which she completed. She started having repeat episodes two days ago prompting a visit to the vet yesterday which showed a drop in her HCT from 38-28 and normal white count, normal PLT count. Parasite stool test negative. Went for ultrasound today consistent with 4cm x 2cm focal wall thickening in the pylorus with a reactive lymph node adjacent about 1.7cm, the rest was negative. This vet recommended endoscopy either biopsy. 

My initial thought from the get go was a malignancy. The scope is estimated to be at least 3-5k, and I’m wondering if we even did do that, if the outcome would be the same, meaning cancer with poor prognosis. Is there anything else I’m not thinking of or should consider ?

I'm a local mom working with an experienced infant educator on a dream project: creating a **clean, safe, and developmentally appropriate indoor play and community space designed specifically for babies and toddlers (0-2 years)**.

We know how hard it is to find suitable spaces for the littlest ones, especially during rainy seasons. Our vision is a calm, natural environment with:  
🌿 Soft, padded sensory play areas  
🎶 Gentle music and low-stimulation lighting  
👶 Age-appropriate climbing and crawling equipment  
☕ A cozy parent lounge with coffee and quiet space to connect  
🤰 Workshops for expecting parents and new moms  
🎉 Small events like birthday parties and milestone celebrations

Right now, we're doing early research and would *love* your input!

💬 **What we’d love to know:**

1. Would you be interested in a space like this for your baby?
2. What’s missing from current options like community centers, indoor playgrounds, and daycares?
3. What would make you feel comfortable bringing your little one (under 2 years) to a shared play space?
4. How often would you visit, and what pricing or membership models would appeal to you?
5. Are there specific features (sensory activities, parent support, drop-in care, etc.) that would make this a must-have space for your family?

We’re passionate about creating a place where parents and babies can feel at ease, connect, and grow—starting even from pregnancy.

Thank you so much for any insights you can share! 💛

(And feel free to DM if you're interested in updates—we’d love to keep in touch as we build this dream.)",1,1741126006.0,toddlers,0,1.0,False

(60% of Americans are $1,000 Away from Financial Ruin)

📌 **Social Life**?

* The average night out with friends costs $75–$150, forcing many to say *“let’s just stay in.”* Nearly 45% of young adults have turned down plans due to money.
* This is why third spaces are disappearing. Fewer people can afford to casually meet up at coffee shops, bars, or events, leading to more isolation. Loneliness is now at an all-time high, with 1 in 3 young people reporting they don’t have close friends.
* **Remedy:** Make socializing more intentional. Host game nights, potlucks, or walks instead of expensive outings. Lean into community spaces like libraries, parks, and hobby groups.

📌 **Dating**?

* A first date now averages $120, making romance a financial decision. More people are opting for “cheap dates” or skipping them altogether.
* That’s why finding a partner is harder than ever. In 1990, most people were married by age 26—now, the average is 32. Among 30-year-olds today, more than half are single.
* **Remedy:** Shift expectations. Instead of expensive restaurants, try coffee walks, free museum days, or cooking together at home. Building deep connections doesn’t have to come with a price tag.

📌 **Car Ownership**?

* The average monthly car payment is now $738 for new cars and $533 for used. Meanwhile, car repossessions are up 22% since 2019 as people struggle to keep up.
* That’s why people are moving less. Owning a car used to mean freedom—now, it’s an anchor. With fewer people able to afford cars, job opportunities and social mobility are shrinking.
* **Remedy:** If you can, opt for used cars with lower monthly payments. Car-sharing, public transit, or biking can be strategic in urban areas.

📌 **Daily Essentials**?

* Grocery prices are up 25% since 2020, and fast food is no longer cheap—a McDonald’s meal averages $12–$15. Gas, rent, and insurance? All rising.
* That’s why side hustles are becoming survival tools. 43% of Gen Z and Millennials now rely on extra income streams just to keep up.
* **Remedy:** Meal planning and cooking at home can cut food costs dramatically. Subscription-based grocery programs, community-supported agriculture (CSA) boxes, or shopping at discount stores can help stretch your budget.

📌 **Homeownership**?

* The median home now costs 8x the average salary, compared to 3x in 1985—pricing an entire generation out of the market.
* That’s why people are living with roommates (or parents) longer. Nearly 20% of Millennials and Gen Z still live at home because rent and mortgage payments are unattainable.
* **Remedy:** If buying a home isn’t feasible, look into co-living arrangements, rent negotiation tactics, or relocating to lower-cost-of-living areas. Investing in assets beyond real estate (stocks, index funds) can also help build long-term wealth.

&nbsp;It flared in the reflection of my bedroom mirror, shifting like the embers of a flame, but I knew no fires burned in my room. I held my breath as I leaned closer, and it came into focus: a faceless, ghostly torso tethered to my body. Glowing the colors of a fading sunset, its head slowly tilted, its three limbs undulating in the still, stagnant air.
&nbsp;

A strangled cry tore from my throat.

&nbsp;Almost as if in response, the entity's lithe cerulean arm stretched and closed its thin fingers into a fist. I could feel my body freeze, and my mind go blank. My pulse hammered in my ears. My breath seized in my throat. Every ounce of preservational terror failed to move my muscles, as I begged hopelessly for my locked legs to rocket me out of my bed, anywhere that this thing wasn't. I willed my arms to weave the necessary movements to banish it, to escape, to do anything. The phantom's blank head leaned forward, blank and smooth like polished stone.
 
&nbsp;I, Calla Li Veris, promising young adept, could do nothing but stare. The demon was bound to me---silent, pulsating, unfeeling---and cold realization set in. With my drawings of witches, flowers, and snails in the margins, the tome *""On Wraiths""* lay open on my lap. I recalled that as sleep finally began to take me, I had just re-read a certain paragraph for the sixth time. I reluctantly tore my eyes away to look down at the words: 

>*""...The Curse of Wraiths, a malignant phenomenon through which human suffering is magnified. Ordinarily invisible to the naked eye and even to the magically gifted, they may only be observed by those who are determined to understand them...""*

And it all began to make sense.

A rush of relief, then blistering frustration, then hot anger flooded my heart.

&nbsp;I had always struggled so much while my peers seemed to glide effortlessly through life. I remembered giving everything I could to help others, but even in my darkest moments I couldn't seem to ask those same others for aid. I thought of my mother, who always believed in the power of hard work and resilience, but I'd always felt she overestimated me. She kept reminding me that ""If you can cast it, you can conquer it"", a mantra that I wore like a noose when I inevitably dissapointed. I recalled notes from my professors, once hidden but then discovered by my curious younger self:

#####""Erratic.""

#####""Scatterbrained.""

#####""So much potential, but they, regrettably, are a total liability.""

&nbsp;These reviews dotted the third of my applications for the local Magus Guild in as many years, and every time I couldn't meet expectations. I truly loved magical theory, and thrived when my skills were put to the test-- but I always took on far too much at once, leaving a trail of half-finished projects and strained relationships in my wake.

&nbsp;The monster hovered behind me, like a possessive tiger guarding its prey. Many minutes passed and it didn't attack, and as my faculties returned its light-blue fist released into an open palm once more. I gazed dispassionately at my reflection, seeing my pale, freckled face and mismatched, brightly colored clothes and reagent pouches. I tried to recall any spell--anything--that could help.

Nothing.

&nbsp;Without another moment's hesitation, I stumbled out the front door, driven by a need to escape-- though from what I wasn't sure. I'd left my coat on its hook, but it truly didn't matter. Nothing could be colder than the world I'd woken up to. Hot tears turned to glass on my cheeks.

&nbsp;I emerged into a crisp, chilly winter's evening. Snow drifted from the dark sky, glistening with mana and dampening the city's usual cacophony. A young boy walked with his father, mittened hand in his, a sickly green creature trailing behind each of them. Just like mine, its gaseous form tapered into a connection to their stomachs, curling around them and pulsing brighter at times. I could see a black arm, malformed and shriveled, sprouting out of the father's, but no such growth on the boy's. *Was mine the only one with three limbs?* They exchanged glances as they walked past, leaving muddy tracks in the snow. I couldn't hide my expression of shock, of confusion. Not now.

&nbsp;Not every passersby had a Wraith of their own. In fact, here in the outskirts as families travelled home, I quickly counted that only a third of them had unseen passengers. They came in all colors and some strange shapes, but the commonality between them was their completely blank, expressionless heads. No eyes, noses, mouths or ears, yet alert and present. Some glowed faintly, barely tethered and reaching, while others clung like shadows, pulsing with every step. The tiny, jet-black phantom that grew out of the back of a little girl's head swiveled in tandem with her movements, glowing brighter as she tripped and wept over her newly grazed knees. Some Wraiths glowed faintly, like forgotten light bulbs in dusty, webbed attics. Others clung to their humans like overly affectionate housecats—*or, in my case, an octopus with a grudge.*

&nbsp;I rubbed my goosebump-riddled arms and caught a glimpse of an older woman sprinting to catch the mana-carriage rounding the corner of the block, with her Wraith close behind her, massive, and with the exact same shade of blue and leathery textures as the leftmost arm of mine. It curled its many hands around her as she strained on the ice, wrapping slender fingers around her throat and glowing as she tried in vain to hail the channeller.

&nbsp;I reflexively raised my hands, the runes on my arm bangles glinting faintly as I mechanically sketched the glyph for a voice-amplification spell. The Words hovered on my tongue, but my breath snagged.

Memories surged forth, unbidden.

I was flung back to junior academy, standing at the front of a room of my peers. The very same spell-- so simple, they said. Basic magic, truly beginner's level.

A distorted voice, soft and kind, coalesced into my favorite professor's dulcet voice. ""Focus your mind, Calla. One clear thought. That's all it takes.""

*But I'd never had one clear thought. Not ever.*

&nbsp;The edges of my vision glowed a dull orange as I traced the glyph quickly, my strokes jagged and jilted. I muttered the incantation, my voice cracking as the hazy film of the past gained a light-blue filter, and doubts flooded in. 

The spell fractured in an instant. 

&nbsp;My voice split into a hundred little whispers, my racing thoughts spilling into the room for all to hear: ""I'm going to fail--why did I even try--I can't do this--I didn't want to--""
Laughter erupted. Someone whispered, ""I told you they couldn't.""

&nbsp;I curled inwardly, trying to hide my shame with my shoulder. Only now could I see that the head of my wraith was cocked, its neck craning to rest its cheek on my forearm mockingly. A small blue arm, disfigured and twitching, placed pudgy infant fingers on my sleeve. Two bit players, reprising roles in the pointless stageplay that was my life. Ignorance gave way to clarity, and the highlight reel that contained my worst moments now had a new, malicious layer.

My hands fell to my sides, the spell unfinished.

&nbsp;The old woman in her haste slipped on etheric ice, her wraith glowing brighter as she fell. A bearded man came into view, quickly sketching his own glyph with practiced ease. His voice rang clear across the block, amplified and steady: ""Channeller! Over here!""

The mana-carriage slowed to a halt, and the woman, hobbling, clambered aboard, her Wraith receding, its grasp dislodged. 

&nbsp;I stood frozen, my breath clouding the icy air. *Was my newfound understanding itself a curse? Was I better off not knowing? How could they not see?*
The steady hum of the mana-carriage's departure faded, leaving me alone, shifting uncomfortably on the crunchy remnants of my summer frontgarden. Father Winter pressed needles into my cheeks, and I exhaled another shaky breath, watching it spiral upward like a vanishing spell. My darkened fingers twitched, aching to sketch another glyph, to form a spell of warmth—but the muscles in the storm-grey arm of my Wraith flexed and glowed, and suddenly I could feel my shoulders grow heavy, my feet sinking deeper into the frost. My bed beckoned. I felt my lips curl into a snarl.

&nbsp;I hated this monster--this curse that had shadowed me since birth. As I squeezed my fists, I stumbled back as a tall woman bundled in furs bumped into me. She mumbled an apology and hurried away, her gloves pressing pink earmuffs hard into her skull. Her head darted in every direction while a flickering, violet-colored Wraith cupped its hand to her ear. Its arm matched the movements of her long scarf in the wind, its body glowing brighter and brighter as she hastened her step. I called after her, ""Don't listen to it!"" and she stopped suddenly, turning. Her eyes, bleary and exhausted, looked right at her Wraith, then back at me--No, not at me, but through me. She shook her head, and shot me a look as if to say, *You'll get used to it*. As she wrapped her scarf tighter and walked away, her phantom returned to its cruel work.

&nbsp;Gritting my teeth, I turned back toward my apartment: a small, red bricked one-bedroom nestled between two townhouses. The snow squeaked beneath my boots, each step louder in the eerie silence. I grappled with myself, seeking to escape the judging eyes of onlookers, fearing further truths. But the chill seeped deep into my bones, and the faint orange glow of my Wraith flickered in the edges of my vision, nudging me forward like a reluctant marionette.

&nbsp;When I stepped through the door, warmth enveloped me, the air fragrant with the faint, bitter aroma of old herbs and burnt lavender candles. Transfixed, I walked right into a long brown strand of ivy, and glanced up at my collection of plants. Once lush, now wilted and brittle, they lined every windowsill in various states of decay. Piles of parchment, books, and trinkets dotted every surface—artifacts of past ambitions abandoned halfway through. A far-too-expensive assortment of spices and tinctures crowded the shelves of my kitchen. A half-mixed solution sat in its overturned flask on the counter, its ingredients crystalizing and crusting the lip of the glass.

&nbsp;For the first time, I saw it all differently. The dead plants weren’t a failure—they were evidence of a moment when I cared, even if only briefly. The piles weren’t shameful chaos—they were my way of organizing in motion, putting things where I could see them, if not always where they belonged.

&nbsp;I stepped carefully through the narrow pathways I had carved for myself between the clutter, entering the parted wave that formed from my flight to the streets. My Wraith moved with me, its three arms trailing like ribbons in water. Its orange glow illuminated a scattering of my notes, smudged with ink and hastily scrawled glyphs, its cerulean arm brushing a dirty, discarded blanket. I yelped as I kicked something hard under tattered layers of unpaid dues. I felt my chest tighten as I hurried past my nightstand, a painful face haunting me from the framed managraph I couldn't make myself discard.

&nbsp;On my bed, the tome lay where I’d left it, open to the same page. As I came close, a familiar grey gravity pulled me towards the opening in my tall cave of soft blankets, but instead with a newfound determination I scooped up the textbook, smiling as I re-noticed the coffee stains on its bindings. The words on the page blurred for a moment, but as I blinked, they sharpened into focus. Nose-deep in knowledge, my numb fingers bordered by an orange haze brushed crumbs and stray feathers off of my plush seat, and I sat down.

The Wraith hovered just behind me, seeming to watch with the two smooth, sunken pits it had for eyes as I read on.

>*""...and some are transferred from parents to child. Though many have sought to rid themselves of the Curse of Wraiths, no universal remedy exists. Instead, alchemists have devised a range of elixirs aimed at weakening the bond, each formula tailored to the unique composition of the afflicted’s Wraith...""*

&nbsp;The next page listed formulas—rows and rows of ingredients, instructions scribbled in cramped, disparate handwriting. My heart sank as I skimmed the list. Some required rare herbs I’d only ever seen in mother's oldest manuals. Others called for precise conditions, like brewing twenty feet deep in saltwater, under moonlight and on the summer solstice. My Wraith interjected with its six-fingered palm to point at a drakebird outside of my window, but I ripped my gaze away and back to my book.

At the bottom of the page, another addendum caught my eye:

>*""While it is true that a cure seems beyond our capabilities, the Wraith’s strength may also diminish through non-alchemical means. Rhythmic, exhausting movements of the body, harmonious living, and rituals of self-compassion are known to ease the burden of the Curse, though the journey demands patience and persistence.""*

&nbsp;I retraced every word with my finger, my Wraith leaning in closer. Its blue arm brushed my shoulder, its grey one settling lightly on the edge of the desk. A rush of relief surged through me-- finally, an explanation. But that relief was short-lived, eclipsed by the sharp edge of anger. *How many of my actions were its hands, puppeteering my failures? How much of my life had it stolen from me without my knowing?*

&nbsp;I inhaled deeply, the tricolor weight in my chest easing ever so slightly. I leaned back in my chair, and an orange arm extended towards the desk. Furrowing my brow as I thought, I suddenly fell backwards, kicking up a cloud of dust as my favorite chair gained a brand new crack. My long, black mane splayed out, the comforting shimmer of my ceiling lightstones became blocked out by a lock of unwashed hair. I pulled it behind my ear as I gingerly rubbed the back of my now-bruised head.

###*Answers.*

I pulled up the chair.

###*I was not broken.*

I closed the book.

###*I wasn't crazy.*

The situation that I started being interested in her started now in the past few weeks. So, she followed me back and after a few days I texted her on instagram, trying to talk about a common interest which was a student activity/association where she was active and I asked about that, just to have a conversation with her, you know. We had a few replies but not much, and with that it got over. A few weeks passed by then and now I'm planning to invite her out for a coffee. But I don't know what the best solution would be. I feel like we don't know each other that much to just send her a text about inviting her out.

I would like to ask your opinion if I am too critical, have high standards or this isn't normal?
So my bf and I have been together only for a month. He's 26, I'm 22, we are both at university. He is studying medicals, he will graduate within 1.5 years. The problem is, that bc of studying and classes, he can't work in a part time job neither, his parents are supporting him with some money that is enough for rent and food. He is always broke, we usually split the bills or sometimes he pays for dates, sometimes me. But these dates are just cute little restaurants/coffees, nothing special. I really like flowers too, and he knows it but hasn't gave me any yet, only a chocolate 2 weeks ago (I gave him chocolate, handmade gifts) 
I'm worried bc he doesn't have any savings, he has a car but thats it, and I know he will have a well paying job within 2 years, but I'm still frustrated that he is always have a lack of money. 
I'm on a kinda hard major too, can't work neither, and the problem if we would work on the weekends, we could never meet each other bc. we live 250km far away from each other. I really enjoy everything with him, but sometimes it would be great to go to a zoo, spa, cinema etc. but he says it is expensive for him. 
I wouldn't break up with him bc of this, but idk if I can do it for almost 2 years.",1,1741125744.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

(60% of Americans are $1,000 Away from Financial Ruin)

📌 **Social Life**?

* The average night out with friends costs $75–$150, forcing many to say *“let’s just stay in.”* Nearly 45% of young adults have turned down plans due to money.
* This is why third spaces are disappearing. Fewer people can afford to casually meet up at coffee shops, bars, or events, leading to more isolation. Loneliness is now at an all-time high, with 1 in 3 young people reporting they don’t have close friends.
* **Remedy:** Make socializing more intentional. Host game nights, potlucks, or walks instead of expensive outings. Lean into community spaces like libraries, parks, and hobby groups.

📌 **Dating**?

* A first date now averages $120, making romance a financial decision. More people are opting for “cheap dates” or skipping them altogether.
* That’s why finding a partner is harder than ever. In 1990, most people were married by age 26—now, the average is 32. Among 30-year-olds today, more than half are single.
* **Remedy:** Shift expectations. Instead of expensive restaurants, try coffee walks, free museum days, or cooking together at home. Building deep connections doesn’t have to come with a price tag.

📌 **Car Ownership**?

* The average monthly car payment is now $738 for new cars and $533 for used. Meanwhile, car repossessions are up 22% since 2019 as people struggle to keep up.
* That’s why people are moving less. Owning a car used to mean freedom—now, it’s an anchor. With fewer people able to afford cars, job opportunities and social mobility are shrinking.
* **Remedy:** If you can, opt for used cars with lower monthly payments. Car-sharing, public transit, or biking can be strategic in urban areas.

📌 **Daily Essentials**?

* Grocery prices are up 25% since 2020, and fast food is no longer cheap—a McDonald’s meal averages $12–$15. Gas, rent, and insurance? All rising.
* That’s why side hustles are becoming survival tools. 43% of Gen Z and Millennials now rely on extra income streams just to keep up.
* **Remedy:** Meal planning and cooking at home can cut food costs dramatically. Subscription-based grocery programs, community-supported agriculture (CSA) boxes, or shopping at discount stores can help stretch your budget.

📌 **Homeownership**?

* The median home now costs 8x the average salary, compared to 3x in 1985—pricing an entire generation out of the market.
* That’s why people are living with roommates (or parents) longer. Nearly 20% of Millennials and Gen Z still live at home because rent and mortgage payments are unattainable.
* **Remedy:** If buying a home isn’t feasible, look into co-living arrangements, rent negotiation tactics, or relocating to lower-cost-of-living areas. Investing in assets beyond real estate (stocks, index funds) can also help build long-term wealth.

1j3mnbe,https://i.redd.it/k9ag8z5ruqme1.jpeg,..The Consequences Of - 3,"Kyllie's heart hammered in her chest as she grabbed her lab coat, the fabric a flimsy shield against the unknown. The alarm grew louder, the AI's voice now a constant drone that filled every corner of the facility. Her mind raced as she pieced together the cryptic warnings: high energy detonation, anomalous energy fields, unauthorized biological forms. This was no mere breach; it was a catastrophe.

The tremors grew more violent, knocking over beakers and sending papers fluttering through the air like the last leaves of autumn. The jar with the alien sludge wobbled precariously, its contents pulsing with an eerie, malevolent glee. Kyllie knew she had to move fast. The syringe was cold in her hand as she plunged it into the heart of the blob, drawing out a thick, inky substance that quivered like a living shadow. She worked with the precision of a bomb defuser, her movements sharp and deliberate.

The chamber's seal hissed as she opened it, the air thick with the scent of oxygenated copper. The sludge retreated from the intrusion, but not before a tendril shot out and wrapped around the needle, pulling it back in with a wet pop. Kyllie's breath hitched in her throat, but she remained steadfast, her eyes never leaving the syringe. The tendril released it with a reluctant finality, and she quickly secured the sample in the case, the lid clicking shut with a satisfying finality.

Her notebooks lay scattered on the floor, pages fluttering in the breeze created by the chaos outside. She gathered them up, her heart racing as the tremors grew more violent. Each book was a testament to her obsession, her life's work scribbled in a language only she could understand. They were her children, her legacy, and she couldn't bear to leave them behind. She stuffed them into her backpack, the leather straps digging into her shoulders as she hoisted it onto her back.

Her hand hovered over the lab coat, her fingers tracing the embroidered patch that bore her name and title. It was a part of her identity, a badge of honor that now felt like a noose. With a grimace, she shrugged it off, replacing it with her well-worn bomber jacket. The leather was scratched and faded, a relic from a past life, a time before Artemis. It was a symbol of her rebellion against the sterility of the lab, a reminder of the world beyond the mountain.

Kyllie laced up her boots, feeling the familiar comfort of their sturdy embrace. They were her armor, her shield against the unforgiving Siberian wilderness that lay many floors above. She had always felt more at home in the wild than in the gleaming corridors of the facility. The thought brought a wry smile to her lips, a fleeting glimpse of the girl who had once dreamed of exploring the stars.

With the notebooks secure in her backpack, she approached the lab door, her heart racing like a wild animal trapped in a cage. The corridor outside was a stark contrast to the serene chaos of her sanctuary. The fluorescent lights flickered like a dying star, and the once-steady hum of the ventilation system had become a cacophony of screeches and groans. The air grew thick with dust, and the walls around her seemed to close in, whispering of her impending doom.

Her hand hovered over the button, her mind racing through scenarios of what might lie beyond. The tremors grew more intense, the walls of the lab groaning like a creature in pain. The digital display beside the door flashed erratically, the words ""Evacuation Protocol"" pulsing in time with the alarm's wail. But she knew there would be no orderly retreat for her. Not now. Not after what she had seen.

The elevator's explosion had painted the corridor in a hellish light, a stark contrast to the cold sterility of the lab. The screams of her colleagues were a grim symphony of fear and agony, silenced as quickly as they had begun. The fire danced and raged, a living, breathing monster that consumed everything in its path. Kyllie's eyes narrowed, her mind a whirlwind of thought and emotion. She had to move, to escape the carnage that was swiftly approaching her door.

Her hand hovered over the button that controlled the lab's emergency seal, the decision to press it feeling as final as the closing of a coffin lid. The AI's voice droned on, a monotonous counterpoint to the chaos outside. ""WARNING - ELEVATOR FAILURE IN SECTOR K, SECTOR I, SECTOR H, SECTOR G, SECTOR F."" The words were a relentless drumbeat of dread that grew louder with each passing second.

Kyllie knew that Sector K, where Finn had conducted his clandestine experiments, was not that many levels beneath her. Whatever horror he had unleashed was now a stone's throw away, reaching its tendrils through the very fabric of the facility. It was a stark reminder of the fine line they all danced upon in their quest for knowledge.

With a deep, shaky breath, she stepped into the corridor, the scent of burnt metal and ozone stinging her nose. She could hear the distant rumble of collapsing infrastructure, a grim symphony that underscored the gravity of the situation. The map in her hand trembled as she traced the path to Sector K with her finger, her heart pounding in her chest like a drum.

The emergency lights cast a stark, red glow over the destruction, throwing the contorted forms of her colleagues into stark relief. Some lay still, their lifeless eyes staring into the abyss of the emergency lighting. Others twitched and moaned, their limbs entangled in a dance of pain. Kyllie's boots squelched in a wetness she didn't dare to identify, her breaths coming in short, shallow gasps.

Her hand tightened around the railing, her knuckles white with the effort of not looking down. The stairs spiraled into the depths of the facility, a seemingly never-ending descent into chaos. The screeching grew louder with every step, a siren's call from the bowels of the labyrinth that was now her world. The metal beneath her trembled, a living beast that threatened to swallow her whole.

The AI's voice, now a constant drone in her ear, grew more urgent, ""WARNING - EXTREME DANGER - ALL TURRET DEFENSE SYSTEMS ACTIVATED."" The words were a cold slap in the face, a stark reminder of the horrors that awaited her below. The facility had turned on them, the very walls and machines that were supposed to protect and serve now a lethal gauntlet of steel and fire.

Her boots clanked against the metal stairs, the echoes a lonely melody that reverberated through the smoke-filled corridors. The mask over her face was a barrier to the choking fumes, but the heat was inescapable. Her eyes watered, and she blinked away the tears, her vision swimming with the ghosts of her former life.

Kyllie reached Sublevel 14 - 04-B, her hand shaking as she keyed in the access code. The door hissed open, revealing a world shrouded in a thick, acrid cloud. She stepped through the threshold, the smoke wrapping around her like a malevolent fog, obscuring the path ahead. The screams grew louder, a cacophony of fear and pain that seemed to pulse with the very air.

Her gas mask muffled her own labored breathing as she stumbled through the office complex. The sterile white walls and gleaming surfaces were now a twisted, nightmarish maze of shadows and flickering lights. The once orderly rows of desks and chairs had been upended, their plastic and metal limbs reaching out like the skeletal remains of a forgotten civilization.

The TV in the break room was a beacon in the fog, its flickering screen casting a strobe-like glow across the room. The emergency broadcast communicating an eerie message:

<“The following message is transmitted at the request of local authorities:

At 07:35 PM - Mountain Time -
A disaster of unknown type has occurred at the Artemis Research Facility, causing significant damage and failure to various power and communication systems in the surrounding areas.

An immediate evacuation order has been issued for all residents within a 100 mile radius of the facility.

An on-site Military has been dispatched to provide assistance.

Make sure to bring an emergency supply of Food, Water, Clothing, First Aid Kit, Flashlights with extra batteries and battery powered Radios. Follow local evacuation routes, which have been marked by local Authorities.

Do not use telephones or cellphones, except in the case of emergencies.

Stay tuned to local news media outlets for further details and information on this situation”>

The TV's message ended abruptly, the screen flickering before plunging into darkness. The silence that followed was deafening, a stark contrast to the cacophony of the alarms that still blared throughout the facility. Kyllie's heart raced as the weight of the situation settled upon her. This wasn't just an internal crisis anymore; the world beyond the mountain knew about their failure.

{ATTENTION - SYSTEM NOW UNDER MILITARY COMMAND}

With that, Rita’s emergency voice system changed into a much darker and less friendly Voice.

Kyllie made her way to the nearest maintenance area as the map marked an elevator which could take her close to an emergency exit.

As she was making her way around a corner  she froze as a masked security guard held a gun at her face.

“What are you doing here?” He shouted.
“We need to get out of here, follow me!”
 He took her to the nearest security checkpoint.

Inside the security room, they took their gas masks off.
“A friendly face” she thought to herself.

“What happened?” she asked sharply.

“I have no clue, you’re the scientist here, I thought you had more information”
He snapped back at her, his gun shaking in his hand. Realizing he seemed threatening, he put the gun on the table and sat down.

“I don’t know what’s happening, but I do know we can’t trust anyone right now.” His voice was shaking.

Kyllie nodded, the gravity of the situation etched into the lines on her face. The coffee pot hissed and spat, a small bastion of normalcy in the sea of chaos.

The guard, whose name tag read 'Dmitri', poured himself a steaming cup, his hands shaking so badly that he almost spilled it. The dark liquid swirled, a miniature tornado in a sea of ceramic. He took a tentative sip, the warmth seeming to calm his nerves slightly. ""You should have some,"" he offered again, the cup rattling against the saucer.

Kyllie's eyes darted around the room, the silence now filled with the clink of his spoon against the mug. ""No, I'm fine."" Her voice was tight, her hand never straying far from the syringe in her pocket. The probe remained hidden, a silent sentinel of the chaos she was part of.

""You should get some rest,"" she suggested, her own eyes never leaving the flickering screens of the security monitors. ""I'll keep watch.""

Dmitri nodded wearily, his eyes dropping to the floor. ""Wake me if anything changes.""

Kyllie sat in silence, her eyes glued to the monitors. The screens flickered with the ghosts of her colleagues' panic, a silent testament to the chaos that reigned supreme. The darkness outside the security room felt like a living entity, pressing against the walls, eager to claim them both. The rumble grew louder, the facility's groans a mournful song that sent chills down her spine.

Her eyes darted to Dmitri's sleeping form, his chest rising and falling in an uneasy rhythm. He was a good man, a guard who had sworn to protect, now thrust into a nightmare beyond his comprehension. Her hand hovered over her backpack, the probe within whispering its secrets. It was a gamble, but one she had to take.

With a soft click, the case opened, the alien substance within pulsing with a sickly light. She took the probe out, the sludge quivering like a living shadow in her grasp. It was warm, almost comforting, but she knew better than to let her guard down. The facility's power was fading, the lights dimming like candles in a gust of wind.

The sudden plunge into darkness was like a hand closing around her throat, squeezing the air from her lungs. The quiet was shattered by the sound of Dmitri's panicked shout, the thud of his boots hitting the floor. The gun in his hand was a silent threat, his eyes darting around the room like a cornered animal's.

""What the hell was that?"" His voice was hoarse, the fear thick and palpable.

A thick fluid fell on the guard from the vent above him, they both slowly looked up, as he pointed his gun at the vent, suddenly the fan smashed and two large almost  skeletal arms with long thick claws grabbed him and pulled him up into the vents.

He screamed and yelled for help while his gun went off she heard a loud almost alien screech coming from the went and then. Silence.

With the probe still in her trembling hands, she sprinted out of the room, her boots pounding against the cold, unforgiving floor. The creature's ominous silence was more terrifying than its initial assault. Her eyes darted to the vent, expecting it to emerge at any moment. The corridor ahead stretched into a crimson abyss, the emergency lights casting long, twisted shadows that danced with each step she took.

Her breath was ragged, a testament to the fear that gripped her, as she sprinted down the corridor. The sound of her heart was a thunderous crescendo in her ears, drowning out the distant wails of the alarm. She could feel the creature's hunger, a palpable force that seemed to push against her back, urging her to flee faster.

The probe in her hand felt like a lifeline, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. Its luminescent tendrils pulsed with an eerie light, casting an otherworldly glow on the walls that rushed by her. The corridor was a maze of shadows, the red emergency lights casting elongated silhouettes that danced with every tremor that shook the facility.

Her breath was ragged, her chest heaving with the effort of sprinting with the weight of her backpack and the fear that clung to her like a second skin. The creature's alien screech still echoed in her ears, a chilling reminder of the horror that now stalked the halls of Artemis. She could feel it, the unseen predator, its hunger a living thing that seemed to pulse through the very air she breathed.

Just as she reached the maintenance entrance, her foot snagged on something unseen in the dark, and she pitched forward. The world spun around her, a kaleidoscope of red and shadow, and she felt the sharp bite of the floor as she hit the ground. The probe in her hand shattered, the thick glass slicing through her palm and sending a spray of the inky substance into the air. The sludge spilled out, the warmth of it coating her hand in a sticky embrace.

Her eyes focused on the obstruction, and she realized with a jolt of horror that it was a body, the lifeless eyes of a colleague staring back at her.

The sludge seeped into her bloodstream, a cold embrace that seemed to fill every part of her being. Her hand began to tingle, the pain receding and being replaced by a strange warmth that spread through her veins like wildfire.

Her vision swam, the edges of her eyesight going fuzzy as she staggered to her feet. The creature's screech grew louder, the tremors more intense, as if it had caught her scent. Kyllie didn't dare to look back, her eyes fixed on the maintenance door, her hand sticky with the alien substance. She stumbled forward, her legs feeling like lead, her mind racing with the implications of what had just occurred. The power of this organism was beyond anything she had ever encountered, and now it was a part of her.

With a grunt of effort, she threw her weight against the door, the metal sliding open with a screech of protest. She slipped inside, the darkness a welcome reprieve from the crimson hell outside. The door slammed shut behind her, the sound echoing through the small space like a gunshot. Her heart hammered in her chest as she scanned the room, the shelves and machinery looming like ancient sentinels.

The creature's screech grew closer, a shrill wail that seemed to vibrate her very bones. Her eyes fell on a pile of metal pipes, and she grabbed one, her hand now pulsing with the alien energy. The warmth grew stronger, and she felt a strange sense of power flow through her, a kinship with the monstrous blob she had unwittingly released.

With a grim determination, she barricaded the door, the pipes clanging against the metal like a gong echoing through the room. Each hit resonated through her, the sludge in her veins pulsing in time with the beat. She stepped back, panting, the tremors lessening as she watched the door.

Her vision swam again, and she felt the floor rush up to meet her. The world went dark, the only light coming from the pulsing blob in her hand. As she fell, she felt a strange, disembodied sense of calm wash over her, as if the alien presence was whispering reassurances directly into her soul.

The corridor's grime and dust clung to her skin, the cold metal a stark contrast to the warmth now pumping through her veins. Her hand, now coated in the inky substance, throbbed with a life of its own, as if the sludge was trying to communicate, to become a part of her in a way she never could have imagined. The substance completely retreated into her wounds, closing them up in the process.

Kyllie staggered to her feet, the world spinning like a carousel gone mad. Her vision swam with a kaleidoscope of colors, the edges of her sight blurring into a dark fog.

Her legs felt like jelly, each step a battle against gravity itself. The corridor stretched out before her, a never-ending path of hellish red.

The sludge inside her pulsed with an unfamiliar rhythm, and she felt a sudden, overwhelming surge of dizziness. The world tilted and spun, the walls closing in, the floor rushing up to greet her.

~“Don’t be scared, Kyllie.”~

(60% of Americans are $1,000 Away from Financial Ruin)

📌 **Social Life**?

* The average night out with friends costs $75–$150, forcing many to say *“let’s just stay in.”* Nearly 45% of young adults have turned down plans due to money.
* This is why third spaces are disappearing. Fewer people can afford to casually meet up at coffee shops, bars, or events, leading to more isolation. Loneliness is now at an all-time high, with 1 in 3 young people reporting they don’t have close friends.
* **Remedy:** Make socializing more intentional. Host game nights, potlucks, or walks instead of expensive outings. Lean into community spaces like libraries, parks, and hobby groups.

📌 **Dating**?

* A first date now averages $120, making romance a financial decision. More people are opting for “cheap dates” or skipping them altogether.
* That’s why finding a partner is harder than ever. In 1990, most people were married by age 26—now, the average is 32. Among 30-year-olds today, more than half are single.
* **Remedy:** Shift expectations. Instead of expensive restaurants, try coffee walks, free museum days, or cooking together at home. Building deep connections doesn’t have to come with a price tag.

📌 **Car Ownership**?

* The average monthly car payment is now $738 for new cars and $533 for used. Meanwhile, car repossessions are up 22% since 2019 as people struggle to keep up.
* That’s why people are moving less. Owning a car used to mean freedom—now, it’s an anchor. With fewer people able to afford cars, job opportunities and social mobility are shrinking.
* **Remedy:** If you can, opt for used cars with lower monthly payments. Car-sharing, public transit, or biking can be strategic in urban areas.

📌 **Daily Essentials**?

* Grocery prices are up 25% since 2020, and fast food is no longer cheap—a McDonald’s meal averages $12–$15. Gas, rent, and insurance? All rising.
* That’s why side hustles are becoming survival tools. 43% of Gen Z and Millennials now rely on extra income streams just to keep up.
* **Remedy:** Meal planning and cooking at home can cut food costs dramatically. Subscription-based grocery programs, community-supported agriculture (CSA) boxes, or shopping at discount stores can help stretch your budget.

📌 **Homeownership**?

* The median home now costs 8x the average salary, compared to 3x in 1985—pricing an entire generation out of the market.
* That’s why people are living with roommates (or parents) longer. Nearly 20% of Millennials and Gen Z still live at home because rent and mortgage payments are unattainable.
* **Remedy:** If buying a home isn’t feasible, look into co-living arrangements, rent negotiation tactics, or relocating to lower-cost-of-living areas. Investing in assets beyond real estate (stocks, index funds) can also help build long-term wealth.

Truth be told, I quit on a whim. I had this nagging cough, and whenever I had a cold or covid, it would be 10x worse. Haven't even had a cold in a year anyway, so I'm just guessing, I think lol.

I made a promise anyway that if my cough went away by midnight, I'd stop smoking, and there you go, it stopped, and it did not come back, which I think is the reason for wanting to start again, because there wasn't much of an end goal.

The issue now is I think I have forgotten what that cough was like. I don't know if that sounds dumb, but when I think back, I just remember a nagging cough, but christ... What I would do to spark up after having a big meal or have a fag with my coffee whilst sat in the garden on a warm day.

I'm literally only just remembering the positives, but it's as if my body doesn't remember the negatives? I remember googling it takes a year to rewire your brain after stopping, but I don't feel it has 😂.

I’m picturing my wife and toddler walking to a coffee shop, playing at a park, or relaxing on the beach. Does that exist? 
We are looking forward to enjoying good weather, exploring a new city, relaxing, and truly learning life outside of Memphis.

To explain a bit: transparency determines how much light is let through a pigment vs. being bounced back. This affects how your pigment behaved with other pigments - as an example, this green pigment is more opaque (not transparent) as it shows up as itself on my skin, but the orange pigment is transparent, so it lets what's underneath show through it. You can see how that looks with the orange dot on the inner drop like shape - since it's not opaque, what you see is the orange combined with the green underneath vs. just seeing the orange. Transparent pigments are also what causes some colors to look different on the face (looking at YOU, Blue Moon Palette) vs. in the pan. 

Transparency is something that sometimes can't be helped since the pigments themselves are transparent as part of their chemical composition. Yellows for example are NOTORIOUSLY transparent.

If y'all do want to have a transparent come out fully opaque...mix with a white base! White is (generally) opaque as hell, so mixing a bit of white with it won't affect the color you're working with but WILL make it show up as itself on your medium!

If you look at my other post on here, it explains all my issues and the epiphany I had about Candida overgrowth last week.

I am someone who has NEVER had a healthy diet, I’m talking 3 cups of coffee & 2 adderals a day, barley ate and when I did eat, it was like McDonald’s or something unhealthy and quick. 3-4 tequila shots a week (sometimes more). I also smoked weed from the minute I woke up till the minute I went to sleep. This lifestyle was fine for me, until it wasn’t.

It was easy for me to cut everything out as soon as I figured out about Candida overgrowth, and that there could be a potential end to my suffering. Starting on Feb 24th I gave up caffeine, alcohol, weed, sugar & carbs and have been on a strict, strict Candida diet. The only thing I kept in my routine is my ADHD meds

I havnt cheated once since the 24th, so it’s been 10 days. For the first week I literally was dragging myself around the floor and it was hard for me to lift a finger. A few days ago it started to get better, and I felt a little bit of my brain fog go away. The only symptom that I would call debilitating is the irritability. I’ve been extremely moody and mean to people (not intentionally, feels like I can’t control it) when that’s far from my character. It’s been rly bothering me but I kept going.

My skin mostly cleared up, my eczema rashes were gone until this morning. I was brushing my teeth and I guess I was being a bit messy with it (lol) and got more around my mouth than usual.  This resulted in a beet red rash that stings around my whole mouth. This also happened to me yesterday (more mild tho) right after I brushed my teeth and I put 2 & 2 together today.

I havnt been using this toothpaste for long (Arm & hammer) but i bought a diff one. However, I was so irritated about the rash because I had a first date today that I had to cancel :( Omw to go get new toothpaste I passed a Starbucks, and the only thing I really miss is coffee (esp Starbucks) so I caved and I got myself a sugar free coffee. I’m feeling so much regret right now because I’ve been doing so good, I know coffee isn’t the end of the world and it still had no sugar but still.

The only negative effect I’m feeling from the coffee is my tongue is numb and the white coating turned yellow. I also feel a bit “high” in terms of brain fog, like it mildly came back. However all of my irritability went away.

In the middle of last year, I was obsessed with productivity systems and scrolling through subreddits in the hopes that I would finally find something that would fix my life. Some helped temporarily, many didn’t. I was drowning in productivity p\*rn while being completely unproductive.

This is when I discovered habit stacking, and while I had some success with it, something just wasn’t clicking. I abandoned most habits after a week or two, which made me think I was doing something wrong. That's when I realised the missing piece: every habit has an invisible energy barrier - an ""activation energy threshold"" that must be overcome to start it. Some existing habits drain your energy (like doing dishes), while others give you a tiny energy boost (like that first sip of coffee).

The secret to successful habit stacking isn't just pairing any two habits - it's matching a new, difficult habit (high activation energy) with an existing habit that either:

1. Gives you a small energy boost, or
2. Requires almost no energy to complete

**My failed habit stack:** ""After doing the dishes, I'll write the three main tasks I needed to get done for the day"".  
**Why it failed**: Doing the dishes already requires activation energy. I was trying to climb two hills back-to-back.

**My successful stack**: ""After I take my first sip of morning coffee, I'll write down the three main tasks I needed to get done for the day.""  
**Why it worked**: That first sip of coffee is not only effortless but gives me a tiny pleasure hit. I'm leveraging that little dopamine boost to overcome the activation barrier for writing down the tasks.

I applied this same principle to exercise - instead of ""after work, I'll go to the gym"" (stacking on something draining), I tried ""after I put my keys on the hook when I get home, I'll immediately change into workout clothes."" The act of hanging keys requires almost zero energy, making it easier to initiate the next step. Within weeks, I was consistently working out 3-4 times a week.

I'm not saying I've got it all figured out - some days still suck. But understanding this ""activation energy"" component of habit stacking has been the difference between temporary motivation and actual lasting change. If you've tried habit stacking before and failed, maybe give it another shot with this threshold concept in mind. Pay attention to which of your existing habits give you energy versus draining it, then stack accordingly. Anyway, just wanted to share this and hope it helps you!",2,1741124108.0,getdisciplined,1,0.75,False
1j3m8z2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1j3m8z2/tightening_sensation_in_my_descendingsigmoid/,"Tightening sensation in my descending/sigmoid colon, is that even a thing ?","Most of my flare-ups start like this: a lot of noise in my sigmoid colon, like cramps or spasms in that area, way more gas than usual (sometimes trapped), frequent urges to have a bowel movement but always with a sensation of incomplete evacuation, multiple bowel movements throughout the day, fragmented stools (Bristol type 5) or sometimes thin stools, and a feeling of heaviness in the rectum.

**I feel like my colon contracts or tightens during these episodes—is that a thing? If so, why does it happen? I can’t seem to identify what triggers these flare-ups. How can I prevent them? And when they do happen, how can I calm them down?**

I alternate between slow and fast transit, so I try to find a balance in my diet. And just so you know : I did a colonoscopy last year and everything was normal.

**What I currently do:**

* Warm lemon water on an empty stomach in the morning
* Ginger and artichoke extract
* Avoid drinking water 30 minutes before and after meals
* Drink plenty of water
* Space meals at least 4 hours apart
* Follow a diet that limits fermentation + dairy free diet
* Undergo an antimicrobial treatment under medical supervision
* Exercise regularly
* Use a small stool to facilitate bowel movements
* Do vagus nerve exercises

# What I’ve tried but stopped (no effect or made things worse):

* Coffee
* Magnesium citrate (caused urgent bowel movements)
* Psyllium (caused extreme gas and bloating)
* Flaxseeds (same issues)
* Abdominal massages to ease evacuation

I will try and give info about each place, but can guarantee complete accuracy with some places changing hours and hosting events during CBC.

Starting off with getting around the city. While Indianapolis is extremely walkable for some things, I would be prepared to Uber/Lift around to places. There is also the Red Line that runs from Broadripple (North Indianapolis) to University of Indianapolis (South Indianapolis), and will get you close to some places but will still require walking.

Downtown-

Breweries and Brewery Taprooms:

Sun King - Most well known in Indy, the barrel aged beers are the way to go.

Daredevil - They have their brewery in Speedway (west Indy), and also their beerhall (north Indy), solid beers, great pizza. 

Guggman Haus - Just west of Downtown with a great space with plenty of space to sit and hang out. Beers are really solid.

Kismetic - Hands down the coolest space in Indy. Great people making good beer and growing their community. 

Black Circle/Loom - Black Circle is a Venue that will hopefully be having some shows, while their nano production is set up in Loom which is a laundromat and bar. 

Broad Ripple Brew Pub - The oldest brewery in the state, worth the trip to Broadripple. Good food (have vegan things as well), but get the ESB on beer engine.

Upland FSQ - Taproom in Fountain Square, good food, get the sours.

Liter House (Big Lug Brewing) -  Apart of the restaurant group, but they have solid spaces. Worth going to for some food and beer. 

Chilly Water - Not very far from Downtown, small space but good beers, and if you are into jam bands I would recommend a stop.

Natural State Provisions - Selfless plug this is my collab taproom, large space with a dog park outside, 10 draft lines from Pax Verum (me) and 10 from others (don’t know what all will be on then, but I am working on that). Good spot for food, beer, cocktail, and just hanging out.



Bars:

Dukes - honky tonk bar that’s in an old Ice Box. It’s great vibe, and can get Lonestar and a shot for a good deal.

Mayfair Taproom - cool local taproom, good draft list

Tappers Arcade Bar - it’s an arcade that has craft beer. So much fun

The Vault - cool new cocktail spot, have to know the code to get into the vault (check their insta for it)

Mass Ave Pub - it’s a staple near downtown. 

Chatham Tap - English vibe, and the place to watch soccer

Dorman Street - my favorite dive. Has solid beer selection but just the best spot.

The Ratskeller - German spot. It’s a classic in Indy

20 Tap - local craft spot. Great good.

Red Key - it’s old school, it’s got a dress code

Inferno Room - Tiki drinks, cool atmosphere

Snug - small Irish bar. Super fun.

  


Food and things:

Provider - coffee and quick food

La Margarita - great food, I think I’d say gentrified Mexican but not in a bad way

Cosmic Cardinal Cafe - small spot near the convention center, delicious breakfast and lunch spot

Side Door - best bagels in the city

Goose The Market - cured meats and things

Milktooth - cool and weird breakfast/brunch

Bluebeard - wild elevated food. Don’t want a traditional spot to have a Rep take you? This is for you.

King dough - killer pizza spot

Sam’s square pie - Detroit style pizza that’s mind blowing 

Futuro - Detroit style and other types of pizza

St Elmos - the his in the steak house you want to go to take your Rep that owes you

Strangebird - Tiki, Ramen, and Oysters

  
If you have any questions about spots feel free to hit me up.

Using my Cafelat Robot and J-Ultra setup, along with Methodical Blue Boy coffee, I upped my dose a little to 22g and pulled a shorter shot at around 31g (about 1:1.4 ratio), which ran about 45-50s at 6-8 bar.

I have to say, not only was the coffee flavor more intense, I really enjoyed the viscosity of a shorter shot.  It also had more dark chocolate and dried fruit flavors and just seemed to really scratch the espresso itch I was after.

Of course, since this was actually a shot for my wife's latte, I had to try again.  This time I tried Methodical's Hulikere Estate from India using the same technique.  This one ran a tad faster, but still had really nice viscosity, dark cocoa, and some nuttiness alongside a bit more juicy raisin acidity.

So, maybe I'm a ristretto guy, now..?  I dunno.  But I do know I'll be experimenting with shorter shots on my darker roasts going forward!

This is based on our personal experience—what worked for us through trial and error, as well as some research. Some of it may be useful to you, or it might not.

---

### General Thoughts
- Many people thought we were crazy to take a 7-month-old on such a long trip, but the only way to know is to do it.
- She may not remember the trip, but it has given me some of my **favorite memories—not just of her life but of mine and my wife’s too**.
- We made sure our **travel insurance** was comprehensive:
  - Included **24/7 remote GP access**, pharmacy prescription services, and emergency numbers.
  - Never had to use it, but it gave us **peace of mind**—kids pick up germs easily, and illnesses can happen anytime.

---

### Flight Preparation & Experience
- **Sterilization & Formula**:
  - We did **not** sterilize bottles for the flight.
  - Used **pre-made 70ml bottles**, bringing enough for a full day’s worth of feeds.
  - **Security Checks**:
    - **Heathrow**: Scanned every single bottle individually.
    - **Haneda**: Scanned the whole bag with liquids inside and waved us through.

- **Flight to Japan**:
  - She loved the **new sights and experiences**.
  - No major issues—most people were understanding.
  - Some passengers gave us **looks when boarding**, but honestly… who cares?

- **Flight Home**:
  - She was **on Japanese time**, so she slept a lot.
  - Had a **blowout poop and got sick**, so a **double change of clothes** was essential.

- **Bassinet Seating & Comfort**:
  - We booked **bassinet seats** for both flights (bulkhead seats are required).
  - Our airline offered **two options**: a **chair or a box** for the baby.
    - We chose the **box** because at home, she **always prefers to sit up*** in the chair and finds it difficult to nap.
  - Most airlines have an **age/weight limit** for bassinets (ours was around **7 months**).
  - We booked flights before she was born and later added her as a **lap infant** (only paid taxes).
  - You can book an infant their **own seat**, but they **must** be in an airline-approved car seat.
  - **We brought a stroller-car seat combo (Doona+)**, but she was **not in the car seat for the flight**.

- **Travel Essentials**:
  - **Compact stroller** – Invaluable.
  - **Baby Bjorn chest carrier** – Great for when she didn’t want to be in the stroller and preferred outward-facing views.

---

### Getting Around Japan
- **Public Transport**:
  - Some stations **lacked lifts** or had elevators that were far from the platform.
  - We often **converted the stroller into a car seat and carried her** when needed, which made things easier.
  - **Google Maps accessibility mode** helped locate elevators, but they weren’t always convenient.
  - Sometimes we just took **whatever exit was closest** and dealt with the stairs.

- **Walking & Stroller Use**:
  - We **walked a lot** because it’s Japan—very pedestrian-friendly, and many places were easier to reach on foot.
  - That said, we still **used trains every day**
  - Having both a **stroller and a baby carrier** gave us flexibility depending on the situation.
  - In **crowded areas**, the **carrier was easier** than navigating with the stroller.

- **Taxis**:
  - We only used taxis **to and from the airport in London**, not in Japan.

---

### Eating Out
- **Restaurants were generally accommodating**, but we always had backup options in case we were turned away.
- **Tiny restaurants**:
  - The travel stroller **fit into tight spaces**, but we still needed a table (counter service was tricky with a baby).
  - We learned to **order separately** instead of at the same time—one of us ate while the other held her.
- **Baby-friendly spots**:
  - **Komeda Coffee** – Cheap, tasty breakfast; some locations had high chairs.
  - **Sushiro** – Fun sushi train experience; some locations had high chairs, but not all.
  - High chairs were available in some places, but **not always offered—you have to ask**.
  - **Compact seating or counter service**? Don’t bother asking for a high chair.

---

### Final Thoughts
- **We dreaded the flights, but they were fine.** The way there was smooth, and even though she had a rough patch on the way back, we managed.
- **Flexibility is key** – sometimes we just had to adapt, whether it was with transport, meals, or navigating the city.
- **The trip was 100% worth it** – the memories we made as a family were priceless.",8,1741122946.0,JapanTravelTips,32,0.6,False

A tornado in the area knocked out the power at my job a couple hours before my start time and we were told we would have a late start. We would receive an email when the building is up and running (we never did). 

At that point I was already dressed and ate breakfast by 6:30 am. I took the time to do the following things in order:

1. Try out a new coffee shop that has been PACKED every time I drive by it even at 6:30 am opening time. I was in the drive thru for a good 15 minutes but I was very happy to finally see what the hype was! It was worth it.

2. Went on a big grocery shopping trip at trader joes and spent $200 (mind you the store was empty for once, so I got to take a good look at everything and the freezers were fully stocked!)

3. Picked up a couple more items on my list at Whole Foods

4. Arrived home to load up my fridge

5. Washed the dishes, cleaned my bathroom, swept, and mopped my entire apartment

6. Left the house again to drop off a package at USPS, then stopped by 1 more grocery store to pick up a couple things. 

P.S. I NEVER grocery shop in the day time so I took the time to sightsee all the local businesses that I never knew existed. I found some cool spots that I will visit in the future!

7. Got my car washed and vacuumed

8. Arrived home, cleaned the interior of my car with vinyl protector, and used a car paint pen to cover a scratch on my door that has been bothering me for the past month.

9. Checked my oil (I NEVER do this). My car eats up oil like candy and half of the tank was gone with only 1500 miles on it, so I refilled my oil tank.

10. Took additional time to read my car owner's manual to brush up on some car topics that I'm unfamiliar with.

11. Now that I can finally sit down on my computer, I'm going to search for quotes on car insurance & start a contract with a new energy company. If I can get my dog washed then I won't have anything to do for a good week and a half lol.

1j3lr4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/50501/comments/1j3lr4g/more_reasons_to_shop_small/,more reasons to shop small,"The Reimann family, which owns the controlling stake in JAB Holdings and is the second richest family in [Germany](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/the-virtual-jewish-history-tour-germany), admitted in 2019 the company used slave labor during [World War II](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/world-war-ii). Today, JAB owns well-known brands such as Krispy Kreme doughnuts, Keurig Dr. Pepper, Panera Bread, Caribou Coffee, Einstein Bros. Bagels, and Pret A Manger.

In 1823, Johann Adam Benckiser established a chemical and industrial manufacturing company based in Germany. Chemist Ludwig Reimann joined with Johann in1828. Reimann married one of Benckiser’s daughters and took over the business when Benckiser died. According to the company website, which makes no mention of its [Nazi](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/the-nazi-party) ties, early in the 20th century, Benckiser primarily supplied processed cheese, salts for blood treatment, supplements for baby food, and chemicals to soften water.

Ludwig’s son, Albert Reimann Sr., who died in 1954, and grandson, Albert Reimann Jr., who died in 1984, ran the company in the 1930s and 1940s. They were [anti-Semites](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/anti-semitism) who supported [Adolf Hitler](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/adolf-hitler-table-of-contents) from the early 1920s and later donated money to the [Waffen-SS](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/the-ss-schutzstaffel). By the time Hitler took power, Benckiser housed a Nationalist Socialist Company Organization — a worker council that sought to uphold Nazi ideology.

In July [1937](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/holocaust-chronology-of-1937), Albert Reimann Jr. wrote a letter to [Heinrich Himmler](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/heinrich-himmler-table-of-contents), the leader of the SS. “We are a purely Aryan family business that is over 100 years old,” he wrote. “The owners are unconditional followers of the race theory.”

The German tabloid *Bild* broke the story after obtaining an interim report delivered by Paul Erker, an economic historian at the University of Munich, who was hired by the Reimanns in 2014 to investigate the family’s Nazi ties.

The report found that Benckiser used Russian civilian prisoners and French prisoners of war as [forced labor](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/forced-labor-in-the-holocaust) in their factories during World War II. By [1943](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/holocaust-chronology-of-1943), the company employed as many as 175 forced workers – a third of its workforce – to produce items for the German army. At one labor camp operated by the company under the supervision of Paul Werneburg, workers were beaten, and women were forced to stand at attention naked in their barrack, according to Katrin Bennhold. If they refused, they were sexually abused. Apparently, the Reimanns, unlike most company bosses, were also directly involved in some of the mistreatment of workers.

Bennhold said, “During a bomb raid on Jan. 7, 1945, Werneburg threw dozens of workers out of a camp bomb shelter. Thirty were injured, and one died. As word of Werneburg’s brutality spread, even the local Nazi office in charge of allocating forced laborers reprimanded the Reimanns for mistreating their workers.”

Investigators found a letter from Reimann Jr. written to a local mayor complaining that the French prisoners of war weren’t working hard enough and should be in prison.

The Reimanns’ also used forced laborers in their private villas.

The Reimanns were investigated after the war. Reimann Jr. was arrested and interned by the Allies. He wrote a letter to the commanding officer denying he had been an “early and enthusiastic Nazi” and claimed he was a victim of the Nazis.” The French barred them from continuing their business activities, but the Americans reversed the judgment.

Wolfgang Reimann told Bennhold that the only thing his father ever said about the war was how much the workers loved the company. “He claimed that the French workers often got some red wine on Saturdays,” Wolfgang said, “and that transferees from other camps said that Benckiser was the best camp they had ever been in or heard of.”

Following the revelations, Peter Haft, the chairman and one of the managing partners of JAB Holdings, said the Reinmans “belonged in prison.” He admitted, “We were ashamed and white as sheets. There is nothing to gloss over. These crimes are disgusting.”

According to the *New York Times*, the revelations led some customers to accuse company employees of “working for Nazis.” The story noted the *Boston Globe* published an article with the headline: “I found out Nazi money is behind my favorite coffee. Should I keep drinking it?”

Following the revelations, the company said it would donate $11 million to the [Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/conference-on-jewish-material-claims-against-germany) to help provide services and care to surviving [Holocaust](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/the-holocaust) victims. The money will be administered through the Alfred Landecker Foundation, which the family planned to support with 250 million euros over 10 years.

“This (donation) marks a significant step for the Alfred Landecker Foundation and our ambition of researching and remembering the atrocities of the Holocaust, as well as providing humanitarian assistance for survivors of the Holocaust and former forced labor in World War II,” David Kamenetzky, chair of the Foundation, said in a statement.

The family renamed their original foundation after learning their mother’s story. In [1941](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/holocaust-chronology-of-1943), Emilie Landecker, a 19-year-old who was half-Jewish went to work for Benckiser after her father Alfred was deported. Despite being terrified of also being deported, she fell in love with her boss, Albert Reimann Jr., and carried on a secret affair that produced three children while he had no children with his wife. Emilie worked for Benckiser until 1965, the same year, Reimann Jr. formally adopted their children who became heirs to the family fortune.

The children knew that their maternal grandfather had been murdered by the Nazis, but they did not learn their father had been a Nazi until the disclosures about the company came out in 2019. They subsequently renamed the family foundation in their grandfather’s honor “to preserve Alfred Landecker’s memory and, through our work, ensure that his fate is not forgotten – and that something like this never happens again.” It is also committed to raising “awareness of the conditions that paved the way for and enabled the Holocaust to occur, and to combat anti-Semitism in the here and now.”

The foundation website says it “supports Holocaust survivors and former forced laborers” and has already donated five million euros to the Claims Conference. Additional funds have been donated to establish a Covid-19 emergency relief fund of 1.2 million euros for Holocaust survivors.

As of the end of 2020, 838 names of former Benckiser forced laborers had been identified and the foundation said it is going to provide them or their heirs with financial support.

“What we can learn from history and how we can learn from history is at the core of this foundation,” Norbert Frei, the chairman of its academic advisory council told the *New York Times*. “This is not just about researching and remembering the past,” he said. “It’s about stabilizing and maintaining democracy today.”

Today, 90% of JAB, which is based in Luxembourg, belongs to four of the nine adopted children of Albert Reimann Jr. The family expects to publish a book next year that will detail the ties with the Nazis.

1j3lr33,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1j3lr33/cabin_dream/,Cabin Dream,"We  pulled  into  the  driveway  just  before  sunset.  The  drive  was  hot  because  my  AC  was  busted,  so  we  had  to  roll  the  windows  down  to  get  some  airflow,  which  meant  the  music  had  to  be  extra  loud.  A  quintessential  summer  experience,  in  my  opinion.  When  the  car  turned  off,  parked  in  front  of  the  quaint  cabin,  my  ears  were  slightly  numb  and  faintly  rang  from  the  mix  of  wind  and  loud  music.  It  wasn’t  quite  a  cabin,  really.  More  like  a  small  house.  One  bedroom,  I  guessed  as  I  stood  there  looking  it  over.  The  sun  was  now  touching  the  horizon,  and  I  could  see  its  reflection  in  the  lake.  I  decided  I  would  try  to  get  unloaded  before  it  got  dark,  which  probably  only  gave  me  about  7  minutes.  I  was  always  doing  that.  Challenging  myself  to  little  games,  trying  to  beat  an  imaginary  internal  countdown  or  trying  to  get  something  right  in  only  so  many  tries.  Anyhow,  I  got  unloaded  and  sat  all  of  my  bags  in  the  living  room.  I  was  wrong,  the  house  wasn’t  a  single  bedroom.  I  stood  in  the  doorway,  taking  the  space  in.  There  were  actually  no  bedrooms  at  all.  Just  a  living  room  that  the  front  door  opened  into,  a  kitchen  with  a  back  door  straight  ahead,  and  a  small  laundry  off  to  the  left  side  of  the  kitchen.  There  was  a  hallway  to  the  right,  sort  of  between  the  living  room  and  the  kitchen.  But  it  only  contained  a  bathroom  and  a  little  furnace  closet.  How  strange.  



I  tried  to  think  how  all  four  of  us  would  sleep,  with  there  only  being  a  couch  and  a  loveseat,  two  people  would  have  to  sleep  on  the  floor.  Oh  well,  it  didn’t  matter.  The  four  of  us;  me,  Hunter,  my  brother  Aaron,  and  my  brother  in  law  Jadon,  we  were  here  to  drink  and  fish  and  swim,  not  worry  about  bedtime  semantics.  I’m  sure  we’d  be  well  lit  before  bed  time  anyway,  and  no  one  would  really  care  who  got  the  couches.  The  only  furniture  was  the  two  aforementioned  couches  and  a  coffee  table,  a  small  breakfast  table  with  four  chairs  in  the  kitchen,  and  an  old  resonator  guitar  that  leaned  against  the  wall  in  the  living  room.  I  picked  up  the  guitar  and  examined  it  closely.  It  was  grey  and  had  a  steel  bulb  protruding  from  the  sound  hole.  It was unbranded,  but  felt  expensive.  It  wasn’t  even  dusty,  and  the  frets  were  worn  like  it  was  played  often.  The  strings  weren’t  rusty either,  as  they  tended  to  get on a guitar  after  about  6  months  of  sitting.  Someone  took  care  of  this  thing.  I  thought  I  felt  a  warmness  in  the  neck,  like  there  were  a  pair  of  hands  that  had  just  set  it  down  before  I  came  in,  but  I  was  pulled  from  my  thoughts  before  I  could  realize  it.

  


I  was  being  called  back  to  the  front  yard  to  take  a  shot  of  vodka.  This  was  a  fishing  trip,  but  in  all  honesty,  it  was  mainly  a  drinking  trip  with  some  fishing  on  the  side.  I  left  the  small,  strange  house  and  walked  to  the  driveway  where  our  vehicles  were  parked.  The  crickets  and  tree  frogs  were  beginning  to  pick  up  and  drown  out  the  other  sounds  of  the  night,  as  the  sun  was  now  fully  under  the  belt  of  the  lake  and  it  was  time  for  the  night  critters  to  sing.  I  took  a  couple  of  swigs  and  smoked  a  cigarette  before  suggesting  that  we  head  in  to  check  out  the  guitar  I  saw  earlier.  You  see,  when  we  drank,  it  was  mostly  music  and  singing  and  jokes  and  laughter.  Sometimes  we’d  play  cards  or  dice,  but  mostly  it  was  always  centered  around  the  enjoyment  of  music.  When  we’d  get  too  drunk  or  too  loud,  then  we’d  go  to  sleep.  Maybe  we  were  pseudo-alcoholics,  but  it  was  our  20’s  and  we  never  drank  on  the  weekdays.  That  was  my  rule,  ya  know.  Only  the  weekends,  “so  I  don’t  turn  into  my  parents”  I’d  say,  like  it  was  a  joke.  But  I  only  joke  to  play  off  the  trauma  I  felt  around  the  subject  of  my  childhood.  



Anyway,  we  came  back  in  and  Hunter  picked  up  the  guitar  and  began  to  pick  out  a  soothing  jazzy  tune  on  the  mysterious  guitar.  As  he  did,  I  felt  the  hairs  on  my  arm  prick  up  and  goosebumps  set  in  as  the  air  around  us  felt  electric  with  tension.  He  didn’t  stop  playing,  and  what  looked  like  a  projection  appeared  in  the  center  of  the  living  room.  It  fizzled  into  reality  like  an  old  static  TV  set  powering  up,  color  fading  in  slowly.  It  was  a  man,  dancing  to  the  music  that  Hunter  was  playing.  He  was  life  sized,  and  the  more  Hunter  played,  the  stronger  the  image  got.  After  about  10  seconds,  it  was  as  if  a  real  live  person  had  fabricated  out  of  thin  air  and  was  dancing  before  us.  He  was  decked  out  in  fancy  1950’s  clothing,  complete  with  a  fedora.  Like  he  was  dressed  in  the  exact  tone  of  the  song  that  Hunter  had  made  up  on  the  spot.  Hunter  then  looked  up  from  the  guitar  to  see  what  we  were  all  staring  at.  Alarmed,  he  picked  a  wrong  note  and  stopped  playing  all  together.  The  second  he  stopped  picking  the  guitar  strings,  the  man  fizzled  out  again  and  disappeared.  No  one  moved,  staring  at  one  another  in  shock,  mouths  agape.  At  first,  we  thought  it  was  cool,  maybe  even  funny.  Someone  yelled,  “no  fuckin’  way  dude”.  “What  the  fuck  was  that”  said  someone  else.  I  couldn’t  tell  who  was  speaking,  my  brow  was  furrowed  in  deep  thought,  trying  to  figure  out  what  I  had  just  witnessed.



Thinking  maybe  something  was  strange  about  the  guitar,  I  told  him  to  put  it  down.  Then  I  went  back  out  to  the  car  to  grab  my  Bluetooth  speaker  I  had  forgotten.  I  walked  back  in  the  house  to  everyone  still  sitting  in  disbelief,  staring  at  the  center  of  the  living  room  where  the  man  had  only  just  been  dancing  seconds  ago.  I  don’t  know  what  I  was  expecting  to  happen,  but  I  connected  my  phone  to  the  speaker  and  set  it  down  on  the  kitchen  table.  I  clicked  shuffle  on  my  playlist  and  a  heavy  metal  song  began  to  thump.  Jadon  was  apprehensive,  and  put  his  hand  up  in  warning,  “hold  on  a  minute”  he  said,  wanting  to  process  what  had  happened.  Just  then,  the  metal  singer  and  guitar  player  formed  in  the  living  room,  performing  out  the  song  that  was  playing  to  a  crowd  that  wasn’t  there.  I  was  startled  before,  but  now  I  was  starting  to  feel  like  this  was  a  parlor  trick  of  sorts,  and  that  there  was  nothing  really  to  fear.  I  walked  around  the  musicians,  as  everyone  else  remained  still  and  staring.  I  leaned  in  close  to  them,  but  they  didn’t  notice  me  at  all.  They  couldn’t  see  me.  I  walked  back  to  the  table  and  paused  the  music.  They  fizzled  out  just  like  before.



Now  I  felt  like  we  could  take  a  second  to  talk  about  it.  We  started  by  passing  around  the  bottle  of  alcohol,  exchanging  theories  about  magical  building  materials  used  in  the  house’s  construction  or  a  hex  placed  on  us  by  the  gas  station  attendant  15  miles  back.  Someone  even  suggested  we  were  all  asleep,  but  after  pinching  and  slapping  ourselves  we  decided  that  we  were,  in  fact,  awake.  After  a  few  more  shots  of  vodka  and  another  cigarette  outside  on  the  porch,  we  piled  back  in  the  stuffy  house  and  decided  to  try  something  else.  Hunter  connected  to  the  speaker  and  played  a  pop  song  by  an  attractive  female  singer  that  featured  a  prominent  ex  boy  band  member.  We  watched  as  they  materialized  in  the  living  room  and  began  to  sing  and  dance.  I  remembered  seeing  the  music  video  somewhere  on  TV,  and  said  out  loud  that  they  were  acting  out  the  same  choreography.  We  passed  around  the  bottle  again,  good  and  buzzed  by  now.  I  stepped  closer  and  stuck  my  hand  out  to  touch  the  beautiful  singer,  and  to  my  surprise,  I  felt  her  skin.  I  yelled  over  the  music  that  she  was  real,  but  no  one  seemed  to  hear  me.  They  were  all  having  the  time  of  their  lives.  Like  kids  at  a  magic  show.  I  can’t  say  I  felt  any  different,  I  was  immersed.  



I  saw  Aaron  drag  the  back  of  his  hand  softly  down  the  singer’s  cheek  as  she  sang  a  slow and  serious  part  of  the  song.  Jadon  walked  up  and  put  his  arm  around  the  man  who  was  duetting  her.  We  danced  with  the  singers  and  sang  loudly  as  we  passed  the  bottle  around  again,  starting  to  really  have  fun  now.  In  the  chaos,  I  noticed  that  there  was  another  figure  dancing  with  us.  Not  the  two  singers,  not  one  of  my  friends  that  had  come,  but  another  figure.  Someone  I  hadn’t  noticed  was  with  us  before.  But,  I  didn’t  feel  as  though  they  didn’t  belong.  In  fact,  I  felt  as  if  they  had  been  there  the  whole  time.  I  stopped  dancing  and  stared  at  the  figure  in  the  kitchen  who,  just  like  the  others,  didn’t  notice  me  at  all.  I  realized  that  he  was  only  halfway  materialized,  not  like  the  others.  It  was  a  man  in  a  wide  brimmed  hat  and  long  scraggly  brown  hair  flowing  out  from  under  it.  He  had  on  pointy  black  cowboy  boots  and  a  leather  jacket  with  chains  that  jangled  when  he  danced.  He  wore  accessories  like  they  were  going  out  of  style.  Rings,  bracelets,  bandanas,  necklaces,  a  wallet  chain.  He  was  tan  skinned  and  wrinkly,  though  not  quite  old.  He  almost  looked  like  Steven  Tyler  from  Aerosmith  was  fresh  out  of  prison  and  had  a  deep  sun  tan.  Just  before  the  song  was  over  he  stopped  dancing  and  locked  eyes  with  me.  *He  fucking  sees  me*,  I  thought.  He  tipped  his  hat  and  smiled  as  the  song  was  over  and  everything  went  quiet,  taking  the  apparitions  with  it.



I  took  this  moment  to  pause  the  music  before  the  next  song  played,  so  I  could  ask  if  anyone  else  had  seen  the  man.  They  hadn’t.  They  were  also  drunker  than  me  and  wanted  me  to  “play  someone  hot”  so  they  could  watch  her  dance.  I  warned  you  we  were  in  our  20’s…  I  mentioned  that  we  were  actually  able  to  touch  the  singers,  and  that  they  felt  real.  Someone  said  they  touched  the  last  singer's  tits,  and  they  felt  real.  We  all  laughed  and  passed  the  bottle  around  again.  The  next  song  played  and  I  looked  around  to  see  if  the  man  would  show  up  again,  and  he  did.  About  45  seconds  in,  he  faded  into  the  kitchen  again.  I  took  note  that  his  appearance  was  slightly  brighter  than  before,  not  so  much  half  existing.  He  was  starting  to  form  a  little  better.  This  was  a  short  song,  about  2  minutes,  and  it  stopped  before  I  could  point  out  his  presence  to  the  rest  of  the  group.  The  next  song  played,  it  was  very  much  a  party  song  that  you’d  hear  in  a  club.  The  man  appeared  again  and  jingled  his  way  toward  the  living  room  like  he  was  arriving  at  a  party  that  he  threw  himself.



This  time,  instead  of  dancing  on  his  own,  he  got  closer  and  joined  us  in  the  living  room.  I  shouted  over  the  music,  with  a  light  hearted  smile,  that  this  was  the  bloke  I  was  telling  them  about.  They  all  put  their  hands  in  the  air  and  shouted  “HEYYY!”  and  welcomed  the  new  member  to  the  dancefloor.  They  offered  the  man  a  shot  of  vodka,  and  he  obliged.  I  saw  that  he  was  fully  here  now, totally  materialized  and  that  I  had  an  uneasy  feeling  about  him.  Like  he  was  a  loaded  gun  with  a  hair  trigger  that  would  explode  if  dropped  on  the  floor.  He  brought  tension  to  the  room,  and  had  a  bit  of  an  evil  smile.  He  wouldn’t  speak,  but  he  would  drink  and  smoke.  



As  the  night  went  on,  so  did  we.  Playing  song  after  song.  The  music  changing  genres  and  artists,  but  the  same  man  showing  up  to  dance  with  us.  As  we  started  to  get  close  to  the  bottom  of  the  bottle  (it  went  quickly  between  5  grown  men)  the  music  got  louder  and  we  started  to  forget  the  strangeness  of  our  situation.  The  man  had  a  static  shock  of  a  touch  when  he  would  come  up  and  put  his  arm  around  our  shoulders,  his  cold  skin  made  my  spine  shiver.  He  started  to  become  more  aggressive  in  his  manner,  standing  on  the  wooden  coffee  table  and  stomping  to  a  song,  nearly  splintering  the  wood.  I  don’t  like  that  kind  of  drunken  violence,  whether  aimed  at  a  person  or  not.  When  someone  gets  drunk  around  me  and  starts  to  break  things,  even  in  the  heat  of  a  really  good  song,  I  start  to  feel  a  little  familiar  twinge  in  my  chest.  A  cringe  of  unsafety,  a  reverberation  of  my  childhood  when  my  parents  would  drink.  I  paused  the  music  and  suggested  that  we  go  outside  to  smoke,  the  man  fading  away  with  the  music.  Everyone  agreed  and  we  shuffled  out  onto  the  porch.



It  was  then  that  I  realized  we  were  one  less.  “Where’s  Jadon?”  I  asked  to  multiple shrugging shoulders.  We  were  good  and  drunk  by  now.  We  all  looked  around  and  saw  no  one.  “He  probably  went  to  sleep  somewhere,  the  bottles  pretty  much  gone  and  he  had  his  fair  share”,  Hunter  said.  I  silently  agreed.  He  probably  did  go  to  bed  amidst  the  chaos.  It  was  around  1:30  AM  and  I  was  starting  to  feel  sleepy  too.  I  closed  my  eyes  and  listened  to  the  forest  sounds  of  the  night.  There  wasn’t  a  house  or  store  for  probably  10  miles  in  any  direction.  It  felt  nice.  I  thought  I  heard  the  guitar  being  played  in  the  living  room  and  figured  Jadon  was  probably  in  there  picking  at  it  for  fun.  We  all  knew  how  to  play  at  least  a  little,  but  I’d  been  playing  since  childhood.  I  turned  around  and  looked  through  the  screen  door  to  see  a  wide  brimmed  hat  pointed  downward  over  the  guitar.  In  the  kitchen  sat  the  man,  with  the  guitar  in  his  hands.  I  snapped  my  fingers  urgently  at  the  boys  and  desperately  waved  them  over  to  the  door,  looking  back  to  make  sure  I  had  their  attention.  When  I  looked  back  inside,  the  guitar  was  sitting  in  the  chair  but  the  man  was  gone.  



“He  was  fucking  right  there  dude”  I  said  with  passionate  fury.  “The  music  wasn’t  even  playing!”.  But  they  didn’t  really  care.  We  were  all  drunk,  they  said.  “You  should  probably  go  to  bed  bro”  someone  said.  I  was  swaying  back  and  forth,  and  they  were  slurring  their  words.  I  never  slurred  my  words.  I  sometimes  would  sway,  but  I  never  slurred.  Neither  did  my  father.  I  had  seen  him  drink  gallons  and  still  speak  normally,  and  drive  himself  home.  Something  I  inherited,  maybe.  I  said  whatever  and  joined  everyone  back  inside.  Jadon  was  still  MIA,  probably  snoring  somewhere.  Aaron  walked  over  to  the  table  and  played  a  classic  rock  song  and  we  all  began  to  bang  our  heads  to  the  chugging  beat.  The  man  appeared  in  the  kitchen  nodding  his  head  also.  I  forgot  about  my  surprise  and  alarm  when  he  had  appeared  without  the  music,  and  we  had  a  good  time.  When  the  song  was  over,  I  didn’t  even  notice  that  he  stuck  around  while  Hunter  picked  the  next  song,  remaining  there  without  any  music  playing.  I  went  outside  to  pee  off  of  the  front  porch  and  came  back  in  to  see  Hunter  dancing  to  an  EDM  song  with  the  man.



“Where’s  Aaron?  He  go  to  bed  too?”  I  asked.  Hunter  turned  to  me  with  his  eyes  closed,  wearing  a  smile,  and  shrugged  with  his  hands  up.  It  was  about  that  time  of  the  night,  and  I  knew  this  is  how  it  usually  happened.  We  all  staggered  off  to  bed  one  by  one,  leaving  the  rest  to  party  until  they  passed  out  somewhere  too.  That’s  why  I  wasn’t  too  worried  about  the  sleeping  arrangements.  

THE  SLEEPING  ARRANGEMENTS.  I  sobered  up  almost  instantly,  spinning  around  frantically,  looking  for  my  missing  friends.  “Where  the  fuck  are  they?!  There’s  no  bedrooms  for  them  to  sleep  in.  WHERE  THE  FUCK  ARE  THEY  BRO.”  I  yelled  as  I  opened  the  bathroom  door  and  flicked  the  light  on.  Nothing.  I  ran  quickly  to  the  laundry  room  door  and  flung  it  open,  busting  a  hole  in  the  drywall  with  the  doorknob.  The  EDM  music  still  pulsed  in  the  kitchen  as  I  stuck  my  head  in  to  see  the  floor  covered  in  blood.  I  saw  Jadon  and  Aaron  with  open,  dead  eyes,  laying  lifeless  slumped  against  the  dryer.  I  backed  away  horrified,  wishing  I  was  sober.  I  turned  around  in  the  kitchen  to  see  the  mysterious  man  hanging  on  Hunter’s  back  piggy  back  style,  holding  on  by  a  string  to  his  throat.  He  was  hanging  by  his  throat,  Hunter’s  face  purple  and  eyes  bulging.  I  sprinted  to  his  aid,  but  it  was  far  too  late.  The  man  dropped  Hunter’s  lifeless  body  and  lunged  toward  me,  scooping  up  what  I  now  realized  was  his  guitar  from  the  kitchen  chair.  He  picked  the  instrument  up  by  its  neck  and  slung  it  around  his  head,  wielding  it  like  an  axe.  The  body  of  the  guitar  came  down  hard  on  my  face  and  I  collapsed  to  the  ground  in  a  heap.  The  man  let  out  a  cackle  of  a  laugh  and  reared  up  the  wooden  splinters  and  came  down  on  my  head  again.  It  was  the  first  time  I’d  heard  his  voice.  It  was  like  nothing  I’d  ever  heard.  Like  a  screech  and  a  scream  and  a  soft  soulful  song  at  the  same  time.  It  was  haunting  and  bone  chilling.  I  faded  out  of  consciousness  as  he  continued  to  beat  my  limp  body  with  the  shattered  guitar.  His  howling  laugh  drowned  out  by  the  rhythmic  beat  of  the  EDM  music.

Imagine a grand castle, towering high, built brick by brick on an unshakable foundation. Now, instead of stone and mortar, picture Bitcoin and logic forming the structure. Welcome to the **Crypto Castle**, where sound reasoning and strategic moves pave the way to financial sovereignty.

If you’ve ever dreamed of stacking sats like a medieval lord hoarding gold, you need a rock-solid plan. And like any great kingdom, your crypto empire needs efficient tools—like our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker**—to make transactions seamless and secure. (Check it out: [https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com))

# Laying the Foundation: Bitcoin, the Bedrock of Your Castle

Before you start placing the turrets and towers of your crypto stronghold, you need a **foundation** that won’t crumble. Gold? Too heavy. Dollars? Too flimsy. But **Bitcoin?** Now, that’s digital bedrock—scarce, decentralized, and resistant to inflation.

Bitcoin operates on **logic, not emotion**. Unlike fiat currencies, which can be printed endlessly, Bitcoin follows a mathematical supply limit of 21 million coins. The protocol runs autonomously, ensuring fairness and security. If you’re serious about your crypto castle, you need to embrace this logic and stack your satoshis wisely.

# Building the Walls: Security Is Everything

A castle without strong walls is just an invitation for invaders. In the world of Bitcoin, security is **non-negotiable**. Hackers, scammers, and even government overreach threaten your digital fortress—so how do you defend yourself?

# Fortify Your Bitcoin Storage

1. **Use a Hardware Wallet** – Cold storage is the equivalent of an impenetrable stone vault.
2. **Secure Your Private Keys** – Never share them, never store them online, and never trust anyone who asks for them.
3. **Diversify Storage Locations** – Just like kings had secret vaults, you should have backup strategies.

And most importantly—use tools that **eliminate human error** when transacting Bitcoin. Enter our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker**, your digital moat against typos and mistakes.

# The QR Code: Your Castle’s Secret Passage

Every medieval castle had a hidden escape route or a cleverly disguised entrance. In the Bitcoin world, that’s your **QR code**.

Long Bitcoin addresses are like ancient scrolls—complicated and easy to mess up. One wrong letter, and *poof!*—your Bitcoin disappears into the abyss. With a **QR code**, transactions become quick, accurate, and stress-free.

# How to Create Your Own Bitcoin QR Code

1. Go to [https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com).
2. Enter your Bitcoin wallet address.
3. Click **Generate QR Code**.
4. Download and save your new QR code.
5. Use it for transactions, payments, or even as a **royal seal** to accept Bitcoin in your kingdom!

# Stacking the Treasure: The Art of Logical Bitcoin Accumulation

Building a castle isn’t an overnight affair, and neither is amassing Bitcoin wealth. The most successful lords and ladies of the Bitcoin realm follow a **logical stacking strategy**:

1. **DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging)** – Buy Bitcoin regularly, regardless of price swings. Emotions are the enemy—logic is your ally.
2. **Avoid Shiny Distractions** – Meme coins and pump-and-dump schemes are the **fool’s gold** of the crypto world. Stick to Bitcoin.
3. **HODL Like a King** – Great empires aren’t built by selling the land at the first sign of trouble. Patience is key.

# Defending Your Crypto Kingdom: Avoiding Common Pitfalls

Every kingdom has threats—Bitcoin’s biggest dangers include **scams, bad security practices, and human error**. Here’s how to stay protected:

* **Never store Bitcoin on exchanges long-term.**
* **Double-check addresses before sending transactions.** (Or better yet, use a **QR code** so you never mistype an address!)
* **Don’t fall for ""too good to be true"" investment schemes.** If it promises instant riches, it’s probably a scam.

# The Drawbridge to the Future: Bitcoin Adoption & Beyond

The best castles weren’t just fortresses—they were **centers of trade, culture, and innovation**. Similarly, Bitcoin isn’t just about stacking wealth; it’s about **adoption and usability**.

Bitcoin QR codes make it easier for merchants, freelancers, and businesses to accept Bitcoin. The more people use them, the stronger the entire Bitcoin ecosystem becomes. Imagine a future where **your favorite coffee shop, local market, and even online stores** accept Bitcoin with a simple QR code scan.

# Final Thoughts: Your Castle, Your Rules

Building a Bitcoin empire isn’t about luck—it’s about **logic, strategy, and the right tools**. Whether you’re securing your wealth, stacking sats, or making seamless transactions, remember that **every great castle starts with a strong foundation**.

And to make your journey smoother, don’t forget to use our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker** to create secure, scannable wallet addresses effortlessly. Start building your crypto castle today at [https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) and take control of your financial future!

I work from home on a laptop and over the phone so I can work anywhere with WiFi. The company I’m with now I came to be employed with because my boyfriend’s sister happens to be in the same industry as well and I was needing a job a few months back. Around that same time my boyfriend and I moved in with his sister (paying rent) and her husband so I essentially have been living with my boss (bf sister) her husband and my boyfriend. Basically for temporary savings time. I saw no issues with that given that we all got along great. Well over the last few months that started to change with my boyfriend and I. I caught him cheating on me and he was physically abusive to me (in front of his friends and family at times) to the point where I’ve had large black and blue bruises on my face and various places in my body. His sister and husband have seen this on several occasions. Only once did his sister’s husband (who is also my boyfriend’s best friend) intervene in any way to stop him from further harming me or harassing me. My boyfriend generally will apologize the next day and everyone goes about their business as if nothing happened even when I’m seen around the house with big dark bruises on my face. As one can probably imagine I’ve been in a state of despair and emotional instability, often times I find myself bursting into tears out of nowhere. For that reason I’ve taken a break from my daily work zoom calls. I just feel extremely antisocial and I don’t want to be seen even if the bruises are gone, and I don’t want to socialize with coworkers via zoom. My manager/bf’s sister typically expects that I be on zoom the entire day of making phone calls. In the past I’ve done this without issue, however lately I’ve been inconsistent with joining zoom although I still am working and being productive like normal. For context our company culture  is EXTREMELY informal and we are independent contractors so everything is completely optional, we are commission only, also zoom is in no way an essential tool to do my job, it’s just something we really do for company culture. I also choose to leave the house every day and work in my car outside a coffee shop just to ensure my boyfriend does not have the opportunity to start a fight with me and cause me to have an emotional breakdown in the middle of my work day(which has happened many times). I figure if I work alone I can be most productive, at least for now. Well this seems to be an issue for the sister/manager. I’ve sensed an attitude shift from her and the energy in the house has changed. She only seems to speak to me to question me about my productivity and each time I causally tell her I’ve been working like normal just away from the house and not on zoom at times to give myself a break. The energy feels tense and uncomfortable. I got a several paragraphs long text from her today asking me if I’m taking this seriously or if this is just another “job” to me. That was exactly how she said worded it and I happened to read it in the middle of working which I found ironic. She goes on to tell me she doesn’t want to put in more effort for people than they would for themselves and that she can assist me in the process but she can’t do the work for me. “I need to invest my time with people who actually want to take this seriously.” “(Bf name) wil always be (Bf name) but you have a choice  to change how you react to things you can either leave and work in your car or coffee shops or stay and focus on work.  Because at the end of the day im trying to build a team and I cant have you only work base on your emotions.” There’s a lot more that she said than that but yeah…I feel like I’m going crazy ",0,1741122286.0,AITAH,6,0.5,False

You gotta love those low efforts offers, like how roadster and deek duke tells you that a ramadan offer means paying $6.5 extra for a small bowl of soup and calls it a booster by adding a half portion of the cheapest salad they can make. Honestly ? considering how expensive eating out is these days, seeing these ''offers'' really is not a sight for sore eyes. Honestly, i blame those 2 places along with crap-away for making ''half portion'' a popular term, half fries, half a sandwich, half a salad and charges you full price.

Anw, finished work and my wife picked me up to go buy stuff to make Iftar, i wanted to indulge myself on my one true sin, energy drinks and decided to buy a 6 pack of SPIN and it is on sale for $0.29 a can or $1.80 a 6 pack. So naturally picked up a 6 pack and we went to pay. I have no idea what hit me but i asked the cashier if the cans are $0.29 a piece and she said yes, but the offer is ONLY ON CANS, and NOT ON THE 6 PACK.

I got baffled, i mean there are 6 cans in the pack, so why not scan 1 can and multiply it by 6, so she said that is how the system works, if she scans the barcode on the 6 pack, it will be like over $4 and i have to go back and get 6 cans.

It was crowded, people behind me are waiting, so i did what any mild mannered customer would do, i ripped apart the 6 pack, took out the 6 cans and gave them to her and said ''problem solved, please scan these 6 individual cans'' and got my 6 cans for $1.80 instead of $4.14 and went home.

Honestly, this anti-logic, anti- consumer thinking that most hypermarkets have is pure baffling, i mean i just got the 6 pack since it is easier to carry and cleaner since the cans are sealed inside the nylon, but nope, it is too hard for them to make life a bit easier for us, anw, end of the day, i got things my way but looked like a jerk to the cashier, keep in mind, i was polite, didn't say anything or argued, i just did something weird in order to get my hefty discount. 

Also, please check  Dunkin donuts ramadan offer, free coffee with a salad between 12pm and 5 pm, that is rich, i think it is more a Lent thing rather than a ramandan thing.

I am adding five raised beds to my garden this year. Four of them are metal. I just put in an order for two more. I've been filling the others for the past few months with leaves, branches, compost and a few bags of raised bed soil. Since I am about out of debris and compost, I ordered coco coir, perlite, osmocote, and epsom salts.  I'm going to supplement that with some pine bark mulch and coffee grounds to fill up the two new raised beds.  

I'd love to use some finished compost instead of this stuff, but I don't have any available at this moment. ANY TIPS?

As the U.S. Congress considers adding another $100 billion to the U.S. defense budget, pushing the total past $1 trillion, I am launching a weekly Coffee Break feature on the weaponry, politics, economics, and consequences of armed conflict. I owe the title to a book by Greg Palast. True to the spirit of NC, the posts will be factual, rational, and non-ideological. Like the other new Coffee Break features, this one will be guided by reader interest and feedback, so comments are encouraged.

Let’s start with a bang and contemplate what I consider to be one of the most evil artifacts in the world, the U.S. “nuclear football.”

It is a small package, but it is loaded with mega-death. This bag travels with the President always, and it contains a nuclear launch authorization code and a set of nuclear attack plans. The plans provide the president with a set of options, ranging from selective strikes to a massive attack causing unprecedented destruction and a possible nuclear winter. The plans are classified and periodically updated in a manner that is also classified.

If the President opens the bag, selects an attack plan, and issues the authorization code, no one is legally empowered to stop the attack. The role of the Vice President is limited to confirming that the President has given the attack order. In theory, the Vice President could invoke the 25th Amendment, but this would require consultation with the cabinet and approval by Congress. It is doubtful that the military would wait for this process to be completed in a crisis. Only direct military disobedience, subject to extreme penalties, could immediately stop the presidential attack order.",3,1741121683.0,stupidpol,1,0.71,False
1j3la0n,https://www.reddit.com/r/WegovyWeightLoss/comments/1j3la0n/need_support/,Need Support!,"So I've been on semaglutide, I successfully lost a lot of weight. I'd say like 60 pounds. I went from 230lbs to 170lbs. I'm a female, 5'4, 47 years old, and this weightloss happened in 2024. Why? Mostly because my brother was getting married, and it took me 6 months of consistent healthy eatings, exercise every single day (minus 1 cheat day a week). After the wedding like a month, I got really sick with pneumonia and it all went out the window and within 4 months I gained it all back. I was devastated. I went to see my doctor again and she said I would have more luck on wegovy as patients tended to lose more. I'm not so sure she understood my issue but anyway. I thought to give it a try. I feel like I  had the wedding to look forward to so that gave me a goal. But now I have no goals at all. 

About a month ago, I started on .5 dose, and there has been no change in my weight. Truthfully I did not eat healthy or exercise at all. Last week I moved up to 1 mg dose. Well the day after my dose I had a huge vomit of whatever I ate. Plus I also have the flu and blocked sinuses. Anyway, I'm to be on 1mg for a while, i think 7 more weeks. I'm trying to do some light exercise but it's tough because I'm so exhausted. (from work and kids lol) also I feel like I can't drink enough water ... my stomach always feels bloated and gross so I'm taking a few sips here and there. I've successfuly had a cup of coffee or Gaterade zero.  I've been feeling very defeated lately, not sure if this is the meds talking or just me.

I would appreciate any tips or words of wisdom and I go through this. I have an impeding sense of doom that it's nearly spring and I'm still 218lbs.",1,1741121660.0,WegovyWeightLoss,0,0.67,False

I’ve mostly tried Nyx liners so far because I really like their drier formula but I’m open to other brands of course. Peekaboo neutral was way too warm on me, mauve too cool toned and purple, ever was too bright and purple on me, and natural is close to what I would want but it’s a little bit too warm. Any ideas?

1j3kwwa,https://www.reddit.com/r/ontario/comments/1j3kwwa/tariffs_got_you_mad_heres_how_to_hit_them_back/,Tariffs got you mad? Here’s how to hit them back (without being rude),"To my fellow Canadians,

As many of you know, the U.S. just hit us with 25% tariffs…. like they thought we’d take it lying down. Like we’d roll over, say “sorry,” and just let them walk all over us.

But here’s the thing: They must have forgotten who we are because they seem to underestimate what Canadians are capable of!

WE are the country that survives six-month long winters, that plays hockey on frozen ponds, that invented the zipper, the snowblower, INSULIN, the X-ray, and the Canadarm that literally holds the International Space Station together. Canada doesn’t flinch and we don’t scare easy. And we sure as hell don’t back down just because someone thinks they can push us around. 😤

It’s not like we haven’t been here before, either! We’ve weathered trade wars that tested our resilience and economic punches that would’ve flattened a weaker nation. And every single time, we did what we always do: we showed up for each other and came out stronger. (Anyone else remember that time Target thought they could waltz in and take over our retail scene? And remind me again…how’d that work out? 🫠)

And I just want to be clear that I am absolutely NOT hating on Americans. I understand that most of them are just people like us, working hard and trying to get by.

No… this is about standing up for our OWN PEOPLE, for the industries, workers, and families that make OUR COUNTRY run.

Because right now, the world is watching. And we have two choices:

1️⃣ We grumble and keep buying the same imported goods like nothing’s changed.
2️⃣ Or we dig our heels in and show them exactly what happens when you mess with Canada.

We don’t have to wait for a government response, and we don’t need permission to respond. OUR SPENDING POWER IS the response.

By redirecting our spending to Canadian businesses, we can strengthen our communities, protect jobs, and send a clear message: We don’t need your overpriced goods! 🚫🇺🇸

This will work for many reasons!

1. Every $100 spent locally creates $73 in additional local economic activity. Also, every dollar we spend on our own products is like a tiny, polite middle finger to the people who think we’ll just take the hit. 🙈

2. Look at South Korea, Japan, Germany. These are nations that fiercely support their own industries and, as a result, dominate global markets in key sectors. Their strength didn’t come from waiting for someone else to fix the problem. It came from a culture of supporting their own. We can do the same.

3. The more we invest in our own businesses, the less power foreign policies have over us. If we continue relying on imports, we give other countries the ability to dictate our economy. But if we strengthen our own supply chains, we gain independence AND negotiating power.

4. Supporting Canadian businesses, services, and goods will encourage our own Canadian pride and the global demand for OUR products.

And before you even comment with “But Canadian stuff is more expensive!” I would like to say that sure, sometimes this is true. But ask yourself what the real cost of cheap imports is! This results in people losing jobs, factories closing down, and strong dependence on foreign countries for imported goods.

A slightly pricier local product today means a stronger economy tomorrow. And even more importantly, we need to start showing up for our people.

People like these…

📍 In Alberta, a farmer wakes up before sunrise, battling drought and uncertainty, knowing that every bushel of wheat he sells supports his family and his community.

📍 In Halifax, a single mom stitches boots, carrying on a Canadian tradition with every seam, hoping her kids can see that hard work still pays off.

📍 In Ontario, steelworkers step into the heat of a factory, keeping their industry alive despite every challenge thrown their way.

📍 In Vancouver, a young entrepreneur hustles to build the next great innovation, proving we don’t need Silicon Valley to define our future.

They don’t ask for much, just a fair shot. And we have to make sure they get it. Not because we’re angry or because we want revenge, but because it’s what Canadians do. 💪🏼

If we sit back and do nothing, this plays out exactly how the U.S. expects. Canadian businesses take the hit, jobs are lost, and eventually, we’re forced to rely even more on imports at whatever price they decide. Sound like a win?

No one is saying stop buying everything from the U.S. tomorrow. But if we each make JUST a FEW swaps, we send a strong message.

If Trump thinks a tariff is going to shake us, then clearly he doesn’t understand that when you push Canada, you don’t just get one of us, you get ALL of us. The farmers, the factory workers, the shop owners, the truckers, the engineers, the nurses, the doctors, the waitresses, the taxi drivers, the families holding it all together. We don’t back down, and we DON’T break.

WE ARE CANADIAN. We know how to take a hit and keep going, how to find a way forward even when the odds aren’t in our favour. So let’s hit them where it hurts (their wallets) while building a stronger Canada.

If the world learns one thing from this, let it be this: You don’t poke a moose unless you’re ready to be charged at and trampled!

🫎🫎🫎🫎🫎🫎🫎

To get this movement started, I asked AI to help make this massive list of Canadian-made alternatives for everyday products, including some hidden gems you might not know about. I also added some afterthoughts as I read through it too.

Please keep in mind this list isn’t extensive by any means, and I would love to keep adding more products to this!

Groceries and Pantry Staples
- Coffee: Kicking Horse Coffee (BC), Pilot Coffee (ON)
- Snacks: Hawkins Cheezies (ON), Old Dutch Potato Chips (MB)
- Maple Syrup: Camp Maple (QC), Rigaud Mountain (QC)
- Peanut Butter: Nuts to You Nut Butter (ON), Picard’s Peanuts (ON)
- Beer/Cider: Alexander Keith’s (NS), Collective Arts Brewing (ON), Lonetree Cider (BC) 
- Wine: There are so many local wineries in Canada, that this should be one of the easiest swaps to make! Eg. Mission Hill Winery (BC), Peller Estates (ON)
- Spices: Epicure (BC)

Laundry and Cleaning Supplies
- Laundry Detergent: Attitude (QC), Pure Laundry Club (BC)
- Dish Soap: BioVert and Attitude (QC)
- Paper Products: Purex (ON/QC), Caboo Tree-Free Toilet Paper (BC)

Clothing and Footwear
- Basics: Jerico (BC), Tentree (SK)
- Outerwear: Canada Goose (MB), Arc’teryx (BC), Nobis (ON)
- Shoes: Vessi (BC), Canada West Boots (MB)

Health and Wellness
- Vitamins/Supplements: Jamieson (ON), New Roots Herbal (BC)
- Skincare: Cocoon Apothecary (ON), Consonant Skincare (ON)
- Period Products: Knix (ON), DivaCup (BC)

Home and Kitchen
- Cookware: Paderno (PEI), Littledeer (BC)
- Furniture: EQ3 (MB), Article (BC)
- Mattresses: Endy (ON), Douglas (QC)

Tools and Automotive
- Tools: Gray Tools (ON), Mastercraft (Canadian Tire)
- Tires: Kal Tire (BC), Nokian Tyres (QC)
- Car Seats: Clek (ON)

Don’t forget about services!
- Banking: Switch to a credit union like Tandia, Vancity, Desjardins, or Coast Capital.
- Insurance: The Co-operators, SGI Canada
- Entertainment: Cancel U.S. streaming services and use CBC Gem, Crave, or NFB instead.

TL;DR: The U.S. just hit Canada with tariffs, but we’re not the kind to back down. Instead of folding, let’s stand together by supporting our farmers, manufacturers, and innovators and choosing Canadian-made products. Every dollar spent locally strengthens our economy and sends a clear message: you don’t mess with Canada, and you certainly don’t poke a moose unless you’re ready to be charged. 

Check out the list above of Canadian alternatives and join the movement!

This is how we turn a challenge into a movement. A few small changes, multiplied by millions, will send a shockwave through the economy.

I haven’t been to the dentist in well over 10 years. Maybe even 15? Wow. Insane. I’m not proud of it and I finally just made a new patient appointment with a new dentist. For the first few years, I just didn’t have insurance and couldn’t afford it and then I went through a really traumatic experience with the death of a family member and I spiraled into a deep depression and my dental hygiene went on the back burner. I was lucky if I could muster up the will to shower during that time period. Fast forward I have had two children in the last years, and PHEW pregnancy really was the kicker and my teeth are one of my biggest insecurities now when they used to be one of my favorite things about myself. My teeth have become so gross looking to me and now I’m beginning to feel gum pain from time to time as well. Nothing too painful but almost a dull ache. 

I take lamictal, Wellbutrin, adderall, and occasionally a multivitamin lol. 

I use a rotating head toothbrush + sensodyne toothpaste and just started flossing everyday (don’t yell at me. I know.) a few months ago but my gums still look so bad to me. 

I have unfortunately been vaping for at least 7 years now. It’s a horrible addiction I’ve been trying to kick multiple times and I’m not proud of it. I also smoke mary jane. Usually blunts. Since becoming a mom I drink a ridiculous amount of coffee every day as well. I’ve been a lot better with my dental hygiene routine in the last year but I’m just so embarrassed of how awful they look now.

I don’t drink.

I had gum surgery (for them to spin a tooth around I can’t remember the medical name for this I’m tired lol) and braces taken off at age 16 and they put a permanent retainer on the top and bottom teeth. Well, the top permanent retainer’s metal that goes across the back of the brackets has been completely broken in half for atleast 10+ years. So half of my top teeth only have the bracket glued to them now. I hate my permanent retainers SO much. They are highly uncomfortable in my mouth and always make my tongue hurt + are so hard for me to clean. 

What do you think I should expect from this dentist appointment? I’m not gonna lie, I’m excited to finally go and get help but I’m also really nervous and anxious about it. I’m going to post some photos. ",4,1741120663.0,askdentists,3,0.84,False

I seem to be more hurt. He tells me he is moving on but then gives me glimmers of hope. Unsure if it's to keep me in the background or for an ego boost or whether he is really struggling. Strange lies he has told include: getting married to another woman in September, having a counsellor and giving me her name, claiming that I have bipolar.

For extra detail: we have had sex, I've given him blow jobs, he has video called me and told me I looked beautiful, offered to take me out for coffee, said he wants to keep in touch and it's too painful to delete any photos/messages/social media stuff of me.",1,1741120657.0,dating_advice,8,1.0,False

Lo behold, it turned out to be Vivek Ramaswamy, who’s running for Governor. My favorite part about the whole thing is that him, a republican, used a George Orwell quote to back up something he was preaching to the two women he was with, while Orwell was notoriously anti Republican 💀 but one of the lady’s that was with him was slaying in her blue outfit and ofc I complimented her. Then I leave the place, and there’s cops and EMTs walking all around, but not a single cop car or ambulance around?? A cop came into the cafe before I left and I assumed he was grabbing a coffee (too busy with uni work to care tbh) but it was just weird. I thought maybe for the politicians who were at the cafe but then there was EMTs too. Anyone know what was up?

1j3ksct,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1j3ksct/always_choosen_last/,Always choosen last,"So how do you know when to walk any in a relationship? 
I met my current boyfriend 5 months ago. I really fell for him. He is always there for his sitsers and friends.  He has always been the gentleman. But it's like he is scared to be around me. No we have not had any kind of fights and we both have very busy schedules. Maybe it's just me but in my past relationship by this time we would go get coffee cuddle on the couch and watch a movie or Makeout lol. Yet here I am wondering if he really even wants me in his life.

Here are a few thing about me. I'm a single mother of 4 kids Oldestis 15 youngest is 1.5 years.  I'm divorced for 4 years and have dated since then was in a serious relationship that turned toxic so I ended it. I work a full time job but always make time for those a care about. Yes with work and my kids I'm busy. And yes my divorced was due to DV and my serious relationship ended because I found out he was married at the same time I found out I was pregnant. So yes with my history I am now at this point where I'm questioning everything lol.

So with my current bf we have been on 2 dates and have hung out 6 times. Mostly due to the fact we both have busy schedules. I text him every morning and he will text back but it's usually short answers. I have chalked  that up to being due to the fact he is at work and moved on. Then the last 3 dates that I have scheduled with him have been canceled at the last minute and if I try to just hang out he always comes up with an excuse as to why he can't. 

I have talked to him and asked him if he really wants to be in a relationship and he says yes he just has a lot going on rn.

Here is what just happened this week. His phone got shut off. However I didn't know that, all I knew was that my texts where going unanswered and when I called it's like I was blocked. I wanted to go over to his house and talk to him but past trauma had me convinced that he had just dumped me.
I had to go into where he works to grab a few items and he was there looking like he was beyond stressed and as soon as he saw me said my phone got shut off. I said okay I was wondering what happened.  He said ya I have fb messenger but only if I'm around internet.  He then got busy doing his job I made my purchases and left.

So later I looked him up on fb and sent a few messages but is felt like I was just irritating him so I stopped.

Here is my question....how do I know when it's just time to walk away from a relationship?  I really really like this guy and I want to make things work but I'm left feeling like I'm putting in all the effort and not even getting any benefits that are supposed to come with a relationship.

1j3kqwa,https://i.redd.it/ubzggflkgqme1.jpeg,The Kendu Inu Community is the harbor in the bear market storm.,"Trying to time the crypto market is a mistake because price movements are highly unpredictable. They are influenced by market sentiment, whale activity, macroeconomic trends, and sudden news events. Even experienced traders struggle to buy at the exact bottom or sell at the exact top. Chasing short-term pumps and dumps often leads to emotional decisions, such as buying at the peak due to FOMO and selling at the bottom out of panic, which results in losses rather than gains.

The real long-term secret to success is holding strong community-driven projects like Kendu and using dollar-cost averaging to build a position over time. Kendu has already demonstrated its ability to grow from low market caps to hundreds of millions. Its loyal holder base and organic growth are key drivers of its long-term value. By consistently buying during market dips, investors can smooth out volatility and strengthen their position for future gains.

Smart investors do not try to out-trade the market. Instead, they accumulate proven projects with dedicated communities and benefit when those projects experience massive growth.

The Kendu community is the best team in down market conditions because it thrives on resilience, unity, and long-term conviction. While other projects see holders panic and abandon ship during downturns, Kendu holders double down, support each other, and focus on the bigger picture. This strong community backbone is what allows Kendu to survive and rebound stronger than before.

Kendu is not just a token; it is a movement backed by dedicated believers who understand that crypto is a marathon, not a sprint. When the market is down, Kendu holders use the opportunity to accumulate, spread awareness, and build strategic alliances rather than giving in to fear. The community has already proven its ability to rally from setbacks and drive the project forward, making it a force to be reckoned with in any market cycle.

In bear markets, weak hands get shaken out, and only the strongest communities survive. Kendu has consistently shown that it is built to withstand volatility and emerge victorious, positioning itself for explosive growth when market conditions improve.

Join the Telegram to learn more, and see many of the real world projects backed by the Kendu team in action. There’s public art projects, tournaments, jewelry, energy drinks, coffee, and more. See what the Kendu community can do to change your life for the better, whether the ticker goes up or down!

Part of my impetus for trying to cut down on life online is partially I'm already to be forced on here for work which I feel like is unhealthy for mind and body, but also simply when I try to find things or use things on here they are having way more issues than normal. Like for instance, when I pull up a movie to try to see the cast, a lot of the times Google gets the cast wrong- sometimes the cast listed on google for imdb is for a completely different movie, it also seems like trying to find retail items has become more difficult since it seems so curated towards sweatshop-type makers that you can hardly find small scale stores which would be more ethical and interesting, in addition- social media has so many bugs now, and I've been hacked like six times this year- on my bank account, on my email, even on Netflix which I was not even currrently using a subscription for. It's just awful. Don't even get me started on how going out kind of sucks now like to coffee shops etc. because it seems like everyone uses Spotifty so like everyone has the same playlist which loops because Spotify's algorithm, like Pandora's, just takes you around in horrible circles.

1j3kq5s,https://www.reddit.com/r/PartneredYoutube/comments/1j3kq5s/warning_using_paypal_business_accounts_to_accept/,Warning: using PayPal business accounts to accept payments leaks personal information,"If you are a content creator, you might be interested in NOT publicizing things like your legal name or address.

I was trying to set up my PayPal business account to accept one-time donations, and I found that there was no way to completely hide my legal business name from public view. Even if I change the display name on the invoice, there are some less noticeable ways where my legal business name is shown, like in the return link of payment windows. In the payment window, it would say “return to (my legal business name)” on the return link. PayPal doesn’t seem to make an effort to completely hide your legal business name and treats it as public information. To me, this aspect of PayPal makes it unfriendly to content creators since we absolutely cannot risk leaking any personal information.

In many places, your legal business name can be used to track the business owner’s personal name and address. Where I live, the government publicizes the registry for legally registered businesses.

I ended up using buy me a coffee to accept one-time donations instead. Please let me know if you have ways to accept one-time donations that don’t leak personal information!",1,1741120251.0,PartneredYoutube,1,0.67,False

1j3kmwy,https://i.redd.it/1pjyb2crfqme1.jpeg,"Desperately looking for internship/working student opportunity, no luck by far. Need help!","Currently in third semester of Master degree related to Mechanical Engineering focusing on FEM, CAE and CFD. (I anonymised it because the name of my major is very specific.)

I have applied for both internships and working student jobs related to CFD, FEM, material, CAE, even classic mechanical internships during my studies(1,5 years), over 150 applications by far. I only received 2 interviews, which didn't lead to anything by far.

I'm currently frustrated. I'm the only one who doesn't have any internship/working student experience in Germany among my classmates. The majority of them are working in English. 

I've tried to compensate by doing research projects in Uni, however I'm aware that academic experience would be useless for industry, especially with the tools. For instance, none of the companies use OpenFOAM whilst academia loves it. And self taught StarCCM++ knowledge wouldn't be recognised as experience.

During a coffee chat with senior engineers in my field, they all pointed out that my CV lacks industrial experience and recommended internship.

I desperately need industrial experience before graduation since I want to work in industrial field after graduation. Though I have research experiences, academia is not my ultimate goal. Also, I'm more interested in writing thesis at the company.

How can I get out of this loop hole? I'd love to hear from engineers who were in my place.

Thanks in advance!

(My German version of CV is on my previous post.)

--------------------------------
 

Things you might be wondering

- My study doesn't have mandatory internship requirements.
- I'm willing to relocate anywhere in Germany for the internship.
- I always mention that I'm open to write thesis after the internship.

Missing informations from my CV

- Relevant courses are adjusted to the position. 
- My photo is placed on the top right.
- I'm not disclosing my native language since it can specify my identity.
- I anonymised my projects since the title is very specific. 
- I took out one CFD tool since it's not widely used.

We definitely want a fairly bright warm white -- the most important thing to us is it feels warm and inviting and not stark.

But I just can't decide which undertone will be best. We will have some pine in the room so I'd like to avoid anything too yellow but the room will have a lot of windows with trees just outside so I worry a warm white with a green undertone could reflect the trees and come off too green. We will also have a lot of red furnishings and I don't know if that means a pink undertone would be good or bad. 

I don't have a photo of the room construction but here is our mood board for the furnishings.

1j3kh7m,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j3kh7m,A review of Harry Potter’s “Obscuro” eau de parfum,"In HP lore, *Obscuro* is the charm used to conjure a blindfold over the eyes of the victim, therefore obstructing their view of their surroundings.

*Obscuro* eau de parfum comes in an opaque black glass bottle, with a metal shield affixed to it. It has a nice black cap with silky black cord wrapped around it, and a little gold *HP* medallion. Throughout the bottle are little gold emblems of all the different symbols from HP’s world.

This is a dark, aromatic - fougère, and is very well - blended. It’s sexy without the heaviness, and nice for anyone who’s experiencing floral or gourmand fatigue. While there are gourmand notes here, and even a floral one, this perfume is neither. 

First, it opens with the saffron and thyme top notes, which help elevate the raspberry, imo, a note that otherwise would have smelled too simple. 

The middle notes of coffee, cinnamon, tobacco, and violet add a very “narcotic” feel to the blend, especially when blended with the sweet raspberry. The perfume smells sexy and sanguine, but never “dense” or suffocating. It manages to smell refreshing without being a “freshie.” *Obscuro* is like how I’d imagine the Forbidden Forest to smell at night.

I think the ambrox at the base is what prevents the entire blend from smelling too heavy. In fact, the ambrox and violet combination gives the scent an almost “aquatic” quality. I could smell the tonka and vanilla, as well as the cedar wood.

All in all, this is a nice perfume for someone who wants to take a break from floras and gourmands, something a bit mysterious but not too heavy.

Lasting power is average (three to four hours), with an average silage (arm’s length). This is a safe choice and works well in warmer weather, too, because despite having some heavy notes, it manages not to be a heavy scent.

Cost and availability: $24.99 at Miniso.

Did I buy it? Ultimately, no. I tested it on my wrists and took notes for the review, but as pleasant as I found it, I liked the Common Rooms perfume set better.",17,1741119629.0,FemFragLab,1,0.9,False

I haven’t had the moment yet where I feel crystal clear or that click in me that says this is 100% right, although I have felt able to complete things without it draining the life out of me, and pay better attention.

1/3/25- jittery, anxious, not hungry, but ok and one trail of thought at a time. Could feel it wearing off but not in an impactful way around 7. Note I did have a kids party and rugby game to go to 😂 did try and eat but not high protein and did have (3 strong) coffees.
2/3/25- much less jittery and calmer, my ultra human ring still puts me in the stress zone all day. Again wore off maybe 6ish today, I had a bigger meal. 
3/3/25- first work day on it. Had breakfast (don’t usually) am feeling incapable of doing more than one thing at once and having to really focus to complete even reading an email (morning) but actually finding the information being retained which is new for me. Don’t feel overwhelmed and do feel confident. Had a nap at 4pm. Super super tired in the evening. Was able to eat fine.
4/2/25 - feel able to focus at work, morning part of the day moving quite slowly allowing me to get plenty done. am still finding I get distracted from what I’m focusing on by messages etc. but again don’t feel stressed or overwhelmed. 4pm very tired. Felt a mild nausea a few times but didn’t eat much today- had to force myself just because I hate the feeling of an empty stomach.

He got up staring at the window. “There was no snow… summer was approaching which meant more work, and this work meant more equipment which costs a fortune.”
These were his thoughts. 

He got set and went down into the break room of his WLFD (Wildland fire department) Nobody except three other guys were down sitting n a couch and watching tv. He sat next to them “Any calls?” He asked.
One of the guys laughed loud “The chance for a fire is way too low, even if the snow just disappeared.” 
A grumpy fire-fighter would wave it off “No sh¡t Sherlock…”
The third guy was deep asleep lying halfway on the couch. 

Fred wanted to change the subject so he asked:”Any plans otherwise we can go into town and-“ 

Suddenly the grumpy FF (Firefighter) would change his mood and ask “Trash the local sheriff station?”

The younger fella asked “Go get snacks?” 

Fred waited for all of them to Finnish so he could Finnish his sentence:”Get coffee…that’s what I Meant” 

The grumpy FF responded back in his original mood “The coffee shop filled bankcrupcy…”

Younger fella “We could sell coffee out of our community trailer-“ 

Fred quickly responded “Your a genius Falk!!!”

Falk “I am?”

Grumpy FF “He said ya name didn’t he?”

Fred and Falk would respond in unison “Don’t ruin it Hobart!”

The three of them would start to sell warm drinks and snacks out of their community trailer to the townsfolk and slowly got more money and more, this went on for three months, they slowly got more money and more costumers, the menu changed and got more creative. 

**TIME SKIP**

Suddenly the three of them where standing infront of an empty little building

Hobart “How tf did we manage to get this fare with the idea…”

Fred “Dedication, boredom, our community trailer and us I guess…”

Falk”And my Idea!!!”

The three of them would start to renovate the little building, ofc they got contractors to help them, they renovated for two months before finnaly being Abel to open

1j3k8mt,https://www.reddit.com/r/noburp/comments/1j3k8mt/1_week_postbotox/,1 Week Post-Botox,"Hello fellow non-burpers! This subreddit has been life-changing for me; discovering all my GI symptoms was a result of my inability to burp. All the bloating, gas, pain. I would be keeled over my desk at work in excruciating pain. Several years ago I thought I might've been celiac or lactose intolerant but nothing ever worked. Then assumed I had IBS and had to live with this for the rest of my life. And here, seeing it all, gave me hope that I might not have to endure this forever. Thank you to all who've posted and contributed their experiences!  
  
I spent lots of time combing through posts and embarked my journey to get treatment. I'm a week post botox and thought I'd share my experience to help others:

**Research:** Through the interactive map, I found an ENT in a city several hours way (no doctor in my city; I'm Canadian). Through the sub, and reading the studies online, I prepared notes to approach a GP for the referral. 

**Referral**:  I made a doctors appointment with a GP who I visited once and requested a referral to the ENT. I was \*extremely\* fortunate that this referring doctor listened and believed me! I was prepared to be laughed at or not taken seriously, but I went in confident and prepared. He told me he google-searched RCPD minutes before my appointment (stated my issues when I made the appointment) and said he wanted to refer me to a doctor in my city. Just when i was willing to relent, he said better to be safe and go to the ENT who I've specified and he sent the referral.  
  
**Consult:** A few weeks later I got a phone call from the ENT's office who set up an appointment for a consult, that had to be in-person as he needed to diagnose with the camera down my nose in my throat part. When I visited, he gave classic doctor standoffish vibes but was kind and listened to me. The camera was weird and uncomfortable, but was over quickly. He didn't say anything as a result of it, but stated he would do the procedure and answered my questions I had about the procedure.   
  
**Procedure:** It was a early morning same-day procedure and I received 75 units of Botox under general anaesthesia. Anesthesiologist talked to me about my medications and potential risks. Then I met the ENT and I would get T3's and pantoprazole (for acid reflux) to help with pain. The procedure was ten minutes, and I remember them putting the mask on me, breathing in oxygen then suddenly I was waking up in recovery.  
  
**Post-Procedure:** I had a sore throat that felt sort of like strep, and coughing a bit. I was back in my hotel before the morning was over. I was able to eat and drink normally, and went out for a celebratory dinner. Nothing happened on day zero.

Day 1 post-procedure, I had my first burp over beers at dinner. Afterwards I had some small microburps. I stayed in town, and went home on Day 2.

Day 2 I had a coca-cola on the way home and started having micro-burps in addition to a long, big burp. It felt relieving right away! I was super excited. 

Day 3 I started having more regular burps with carbonated beverages (bubly, coke, beer etc) and I'm able to turn my neck to the left and have burps come up immediately after drinking and after a while. My bloating disappated and *much* less gas! It feels so cathartic and wonderful. I went for a run for the first time on the fifth day, and my only issue was being out of shape but no stomach pains that I would usually endure doing cardio or workouts.   
  
Now I'm burping regularly and able to sense when I need to burp. Lots of mix of bigger burps and not so micro burps anymore, and it feels absolutely wonderful. Drinking 4+ cans a day to train my body.  Coffee, wine, beer etc all gives me burps and I'm able to relax at night not in pain anymore! My main nervousness now is when the botox will wear off, but I'm hopeful it will take, and I'm much more comfortable in the routine now.  
  
I *highly* recommend this to anyone on the fence about the procedure; there is much less pain and I feel I can enjoy life fuller now. I'm excited for every burp and belch I have and they're frequent! If you're not sure, just do it.

Thanks again to everyone on this sub, I would not have known about this otherwise and it's changing my life. Thank you thank you thank you.",6,1741119045.0,noburp,2,1.0,False
