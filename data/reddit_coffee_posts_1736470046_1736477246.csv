1hxu3qy,https://www.reddit.com/r/supermariologan_/comments/1hxu3qy/brooklyn_guys_last_hope_review/,Brooklyn Guy’s Last Hope Review ,"Rating: 7/10   
  
Pros:  
\- Unpopular opinion, but both of the concepts in this video aren’t too bad, tbh. The first concept of Brooklyn Guy trying to catch Jimmy Butler with his Looney Tunes ahh traps was silly but in an enjoyable way, and the second concept of Mario and Brooklyn Guy time-traveling to stop Jimmy Butler from loving Coffee was kinda creative.  
\- Mario and Brooklyn Guy (for the most part) were both decent here.  
\- The scenes where Brooklyn Guy and Karen try to trap Jimmy Butler was pretty entertaining.  
\- The time travel scenes were also entertaining as well.  
  
Cons:  
\- Brooklyn Guy was annoying near the beginning of the video.  
\- Jimmy Butler was mediocre here. Similar to his last appearance, his only joke was him loving coffee and that’s it.  
  
Overall, this was a surprisingly good Jimmy Butler video. I really appreciated Logan actually doing something unique with this really tiresome trope. It’s not perfect, but it’s easily the best Heat video.",2,1736475958.0,supermariologan_,0,1.0,False
1hxu33h,https://www.reddit.com/r/TimHortons/comments/1hxu33h/mcdonalds_isnt_using_didnt_take_tims_old_supplier/,McDonald’s isn’t using/ didn’t take Tim’s old supplier/ recipe. I don’t understand why people keep insisting otherwise with no proof and nothing but speculation from people who just blindly regurgitate it,"
A 2019 press release mentions McDonald’s has been using Mother Parkers since at least 1990:

> We are so proud of our ongoing partnerships and Mother Parkers’ role in the McFamily for over 30 years.

https://web.archive.org/web/20190208202810/https://www.mother-parkers.com/our-story/our-press-releases/mcdonalds-john-betts-congratulations/

And even though that is 6 years old, McDonald’s still has Mother Parkers on their website:

> Trusted Brands — We shop where our guests shop – our basket is just a bit bigger! McDonald’s buys and serves the same wholesome foods our guests use at home, supplied by brand name companies Canadians know and trust such as Cargill, Coca-Cola, Danone, McCain, Minute Maid, **MOTHER PARKERS**, Nestle, Quaker, Saputo.

The Tim Hortons CEO also squashed the bs here:

> Tim Hortons wants you to know that it did not sell any aspect of its closely-guarded coffee recipe – including its supplier, blends and beans – to its competitor, McDonald’s.- “I don’t know why this story originated, or how it grew the way it did, but I can 100 per cent confirm that it is a myth,

https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/tim-hortons-did-not-sell-coffee-recipe-to-mc-donalds-194810309.html?guccounter=1

So why does Tim’s coffee suck now? I don’t know, maybe because they were bought out by a company looking to cut costs resulting in a crappier product? Or maybe all the TFW’s don’t care and you have rose-tinted glasses on? Or maybe because Tim’s decided to build their own roasting plants which has changed the taste: 

Bought their own plant in 2001: https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/money/2017/11/15/who-knew-tim-hortons-coffee-roasted-rochester/863188001/

They built their another plant. Article from 2009: https://company.timhortons.com/us/en/corporate/news-release.php?id=5892

Ignoring all that, the recipe is considered proprietary. 

> In fact, he says, there are just three employees in the company that actually know the formula for blending and roasting the Tim Hortons coffee that goes into a double-double.

…

> “Our coffee recipe is the most valuable asset in the entire company,” Hancock said. “We have not sold or shared any part of our coffee business with any competitor.”

Meaning McDonald’s can’t just walk into Mother Parkers and say “gib me tim recipe plz thnx”. That’s not how it works. 

And use some logic here - Why would Tim Horton’s allow their direct competition to take their “most valuable asset”?",0,1736475906.0,TimHortons,1,0.46,False

I’ve been doing mentoring for a while, but like many others, I’m finding that I no longer have the mental bandwidth for it. I’ve typically ended my mentorships after helping individuals secure a job and settle into their first few months. However, one of my mentees, who shares the same nationality as me, seems to feel a sense of entitlement. He views me as an older sister and believes that we should regularly catch up, with me offering advice and support.

Lately, I’ve started to notice some red flags—he often seeks constant affirmation and compliments, and his behavior is becoming increasingly uncomfortable. Additionally, he occasionally experiences episodes of depression, which only adds to the emotional burden. I’m very busy at work, but he continually pesters me to have coffee chats, and it’s becoming more and more draining.

I’m struggling with how to let him know that I no longer wish to continue this type of mentorship or friendship. He doesn’t seem to listen to any of the advice I’ve offered, and his behavior is starting to feel more like an obligation than a meaningful connection. How can I set clear boundaries and communicate that I’m no longer available for these ongoing interactions, without making it seem dismissive or harsh?",1,1736475737.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False
1hxtzuh,https://www.reddit.com/r/vagabond/comments/1hxtzuh/follow_the_signs_to_a_shelter/,Follow the signs... to a shelter?,"I woke up this morning in 26 degrees. Ice covering the tent. Had to pee. Decided rather than go out and come back in I would pack my gear and head for the truck stop. Gear packed. 'Damn it's cold out here!' Gear on. Head for truck stop.

Bathroom. Coffee. Drop gear in the Arby's. Go get cold breakfast burritos. Microwave.  Back to gear. A little reddit. Breakfast done. Outside to smoke. Back in to wait out the cold and charge my phones. Thought about yesterday for a minute. 'WTF? That was a new one! What a wingnut. Put it out of your mind. Done.'

'This coffee has me wired for sound! It's warming up a little.' Check weather. 37 degrees. Almost 10:00am. 'Time to get this show on the road."" Gear on. Out to onramp. Not too busy, but steady.

Two hours later a car pulls over. ""Just wanna let you know, for my safety, I've got a loaded 45 right here."" ""No worries."" ""Ok. Get in."" Gear in. Me in. ""Thanks for stopping."" ""Yeah man. No problem.""

Dude proceeds to tell me about how his son is out of control on meth. ""He gets in these rages when he comes down. I'm disabled. He'd fuckin' kill me if he got a hold of me! I've been staying at my friend's place."" Tells me about his son raging out witha filet knife in his hand, beating it on the floor until it slipped and cut his hand real bad. Won't go to a hospital because he's too paranoid. We roll on down the road.

He's talking. I'm listening, adding the appropriate responses throughout. He goes 60 miles past where he's going. Figures it out. Drops me off when he turns around.

'Shit. I'm on the wrong highway.' Maps. 'Everything goes to Mobile from here. Maybe there's a reason I wound up on this road. I'm in the middle of nowhere. Nothing around. Lots of cars go by for the next couple hours. 'I definitely don't want to be stuck here tonight. It's gonna rain tomorrow all day. I need to get near some food, get my tent setup, and hunker down.'

It's a little after 4:00pm. Clouds are rolling in from the storm that's coming. It's starting to get dark. 'I do not want to be here in my tent for the next fourty-eight hours.' 

A truck coming from behind me pulls over in front of me. ""I know of a mission. They'll help you. I'll take you there. "" ""I'm actually on my way somewhere. Can you give me a ride just to a gas station or a small town."" ""Ok. Do you mind getting in the back? I have a baby in here."" ""No worries."" Gear in truck bed. Me in truck bed. We're off. I feel like I'm going the wrong way but I'm gonna just see where I wind up. Watching maps.

'We're back on the highway I need. Sweet!' I feel a turn. Tap on glass. Point down. Get a nod. We pull into a shopping center with a walmart and bunch of places to eat, a dollar store... Everything I might need. 'Awesome!'

She proceeds to call a church to find me some help. I'm not really into it, but might as well let her try. Numbers exchanged. ""You're all set. You can go into walmart. Use the bathroom. Warm up. They'll call you.""

I head to walmart. Smoke a cigarette. Phone rings. ""Why didn't you go to the shelter?"" ""I didn't know where I was. I was trying to not get knocked off course. Ok. That's cool. You don't need me. I'll  text you a number. Call them. If it doesn't work out call me back."" ""Will do."" I call.

Message: ""Text your address and how many in your party. We'll come get you."" 'Fuck it. I'll ask questions before I go.' Text address and number of people. Immediate text back. ""Give me 30-45 minutes."" Text back. ""Will do."" Go inside walmart to warm up. Reddit. Getting close to time. Better get a smoke in. 

Outside. Finish smoke. Van pulls up. ""You looking for a place to stay?"" ""Yeah. Couple questions. Can I smoke?"" ""Yeah."" ""Can I use my phone?"" ""Yeah."" ""Fair enough."" Gear in. Me in. ""Man, you were in the right spot. You're the easiest person I've ever found."" "" I figured I'd try and make it easy. "" Dude from yesterday calls. I silence phone. 'No way I'm talking to that guy.' No message. 

Get to talking. Tell dude I'm looking for work. ""You're the most intelligent guy I've ever dealt with. They're adding on to the place. I'm gonna hook you up with the guys doing the building.  They need someone like you."" 'As long as I'm getting paid. I'm not trying to get into a shelter program.' Get to shelter. Me out. Gear out. Intake. One hitter gets tossed. 'Fuck it.' Knife in backpack. Brief search. Get anything I need for the night out. Gear in bag. Bag taken to storage.

""Are you kicking us out in the rain tomorrow."" ""This is just for tonight. Tomorrow we'll take you anywhere you want to go. We'll get you a new sleepingbag too before you go."" 'That works. I'll go back to that walmart, pitch the tent if I need to, and be on my way again after the rain. Oh yeah first guy said they hand out greyhound passes. Have to look into that. Where do I want to go?' 

Get a cot. Everybody seems relatively chill. Sermon starts. Head guy asks if I need food ""Yes."" Eat. 'That was really good.' ""Do you need some more?"" ""Nah I'm good, thanks."" ""You need a shower?"" ""I'm good"" ""No you're not."" ""Fair enough."" "" You wanna wait until after sermon?"" ""Yeah."" I just wanted a minute to chill and take in my surroundings.

'I have no need to listen to this woman's long story about doing drugs and getting saved.' Outside. Smoke.

Got a warm bed, shower, food, and a ride to right where I need to be in the morning. It will probably be raining, but that's tomorrow's problem. 'What's that? Shit. It's starting to rain.'

1hxtt9p,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hxtt9p,AIO ending a lifelong friendship and having a mental breakdown over this accusation?,"TW SA, adolescent drug and alcohol abuse

So me and this girl Lana have been friends since we were children. She’s always been kind of a terrible person/friend but I chalked it up to her incredibly abusive childhood and her moms significant mental health problems (probably genetic) idk I just felt bad for her and she made me feel less lonely about my own really abusive childhood (I figured I just adjusted better?) ((absolutely not adjusted properly at all, just slightly better than her))

So middle school came around and she came up to me and said “we’re dating now” it was a little shocking but I didn’t fight it. I’d developed a little bit of a crush on her (I think mostly because she was 2 years older and she had the house we could do whatever we wanted at, drink, drugs, have boys over, no rules or complaints ever). We used to kiss, hold hands, cuddle but never actually had sex. 

TW: 
So about the end through middle school, there was a boy I liked who’s name was Adrian. He used to come over to her house a lot to smoke hookah with us. Her grandma bought us a gallon of cheap vodka to share and we got pretty wasted. I tried to come on to him and he said something along the lines of “I like you but you’re drunk” kudos to him, kind of. I came in the backyard to him and Lana having sex on the couch. I blacked out but remember a couple things throughout the night, breaking the sliding glass door when I tried to get away from Lana trying to kiss me, stepping on and burning my foot on a hot coal from the hookah, and finally waking up naked to Lana’s grandma yelling at me for being ungrateful for her saving me from choking to death on my own vomit. Me and Lana took a bath together after trying to figure out what happened and we ended up basically having sex for the first time. 

I was sick for weeks and started dodging her calls and texts. Had to try to lie and explain to my mom why I looked so terrible and had so many bruises and cuts etc, ended up explaining to her that me and Lana got into a really bad brawl after play fighting and broke the coffee table. She kind of gave up arguing with me so I could hide from my stepdad..

TW
The next time I saw Lana was after something terrible happened to my sister and I went to her for mostly advice and comfort. It was really awful and I didn’t know what to do. She came over to my house. Idk how it happened but we ended up in my bed kissing and cuddling, I was masturbating. I asked Lana to eat me o/ and she said no, tbh I asked again a little later and she said no again. It was pretty awkward after and she left. I was really ashamed I was even horny after what happened to my sister or that I was even attracted to Lana after everything that happened. I think Lana was awkward too but I didn’t think much of it, I figured it was probably because I asked for a sexual favor, she was always awkward when it came to anything more than kissing and groping unless it was with a guy (I should’ve further questioned why she was with a girl if it was too much for her)

She was a really really possessive friend and I feel like me being her “girlfriend” was a way for her to be more controlling. Ie; she would freak out if I talked to any of her friends without her present because she needed to know what we were talking about, I wasn’t allowed to befriend her sisters or cousins or anyone because of jealousy, she didn’t like a single one of my friends lol even going as far as throwing a tantrum at my birthday party I had to leave everyone alone in my house to go console her, she would constantly go through my messages and need to know what I was doing or who I was talking to. 

Anyway fast forward, she texted me something really really messed up about my sister “asking” for what happened to her or deserving it or something, I don’t exactly remember but there were multiple texts of us arguing that she basically didn’t believe my sister about what happened and thought it was her fault because of the situation. (It was my sisters, friend’s dad)

My mom found the texts in my phone after going through it and that was the end of us being allowed to talk at all.

Fast forward a couple years, I moved out for my 18th birthday to live in another state. 💪🥳 (hardest thing I’ve ever done)

Post about it on Facebook a couple weeks later and immediately get texts from her “Omg congratulations” blah blah blah, idk why I even responded, I think I just forgot about all the bad shit? I had just lost my whole group of friends due to moving, went from being one of the most popular people to knowing nobody and leaving my younger siblings in an abusive house, idk it was a mess. 

Everything was really great between us basically just being pen pals.(not that great in hindsight) She gets pregnant and I was super happy for her, she starts asking me for YEARS to come out and live with her and be her nanny and help her out and “I’m the only person she really could ever trust with her babies” the whole thing. 

About 4 years go by of her just begging for me to come out. 

Backstory on Lana’s living situation: 
One of her sisters, Jana is in the military and  Lana and her other sister Ava moved from the east coast to live with her. Jana bought a house for them to live in. 
Lana at the time had a boyfriend on the east coast that she wanted to marry, he wasn’t ready, she had him fly to her to tell him that she had cheated on him and didn’t want to work it out. 
Cheat on him how you ask? 
She was going around her town of 20k people and asking anyone and everyone to get her pregnant because her and her sisters had a house and now she wants to have a baby. Finally, some hick, gets her pregnant and she tells him she doesn’t want him to have anything to do with her baby. She wants to be a single mom and thanks for being her sperm donor. (She didn’t want to pay the 2k or whatever to use an actual sperm donor) 
Then, 6-7 months pregnant, she started seeing this guy (her current husband) but he’s a creep. He told her that he messed around with his full blood younger sister sexually when they were teens and are super close still, that his ex is a stripper, that he didn’t know if he really wanted a relationship with her (she was almost due with another man’s kid) idk the whole thing was messy. Lana admitted to basically being obsessed with him and not caring at all. 
Fast forward to her getting pregnant again, and she’s telling me that he thinks he’s messing around sexually with her little sister Ava, she hates his cats, saying crazy stuff about how she wishes they would die or how she wants to take them to be euthanized, how wrong the thing with his sister is, how they shouldn’t be talking or having a relationship at all as adults because of what  happened, etc. 
Basically I’m her therapist at this point. They all live together at her sisters house. 

TW
I got SA at gunpoint by a co-worker last August and then my grandma passed away a few months later and then I started having really serious health concerns (breast problems, suspected brain tumor etc), then que my 5 year relationship with my ex ending with him cheating on me with my sister. My life was completely falling apart. 

TW Stupidity
I start planning to move to Lana’s. 

I lost my job after I got severely injured at work, and am basically crippled now.  This was the last straw on top of having no reliable family, so, I sold all my stuff and got a one way plane ticket to Lana’s. I was really nervous about the move and trying to find literally any other solution, but ya girl was staying in a car so.. my plan was just to get an easy desk job or something, save up for my own place, try to get into school and ghost everyone, tbh my mental health was already spiraling at this point. 

I moved 1,500 miles away. Got on a plane super scared and just left. 

As soon as I got there things were awkward,
she said “my husband is off work tonight so I’m planning on spending time with him and the kids, you can just hang out and get situated let me know if you need anything” I was kind of taken aback. I wasn’t expecting her to drop her life for me but I wasn’t expecting her to act so cold either. 

Immediately I started regretting my decision.

Her mom Tina started telling me that she’s super sick and it’s terminal and started texting me all this really sad stuff. I immediately went to talk to Lana and she was laughing like “girl my moms on drugs and she’s crazy she’s not sick or dying”. 
I told her I was going to bed and started having a panic attack. My dad died from cancer when I was like 11 and it’s something that I still struggle with. 

Everything starts unraveling. My really really good childhood friend passed away from suicide and I was the one who found him. She told me she’s naming her kid after him because of how sweet he sounded in all the stories I would tell her. I started crying immediately. 

Her husband went into the bathroom while Ava was in the shower and Lana was asleep. I was too scared to tell Lana because she was saying crazy things like “I’ll kill him and his sister if I catch them” and her mom has a very serious mental health history. I tried to pull the husband D aside and talk to him to him telling me “and you think she’ll believe you if you tell her”

Her husbands sister came over to their house and paraded around in a little skimpy dress and kept whispering to him and sitting on his lap and were taking cute photos sans Lana with the kids on their laps kissing them (ya know like couples photos)

The last straw for me was her babysitting for this lady, for $20/day for 8-10 hours a day, and the lady bringing over a super sick kid. (My immune system is basically non existent due to medical problems and medications and my insurance covers about 25% for out of state medical) and Lana told the mom, “haha yeah my friend is living here has xyz exact health conditions, she can’t be around sick kids” but then took the kid in anyway after I told her I would even give her the $60 or whatever she would lose until the kid was better. 

Lana’s own kids don’t have insurance either and her husband and her constantly fight about her taking in sick kids as they don’t even make money off the babysitting because they supply diapers, food etc on top of multiple thousands of dollars in bills because of having sick kids and no insurance. 

So the texts are as follows. 

The first texts of her asking if I’m upset if I want to go home were because I’d been there for two weeks and woke up to her at 7am telling some lady she babysits for (her words are that they’re not friends so idk why she would do this) that I’m sick and this is what’s wrong and my dad died from cancer so I’m scared, and that my family is awful and my sister just lost her baby (ALL of my business) and when I asked her if she wanted to spend some time and talk with me her suggestion was family game night with her husband, sisters and kids. Absolutely basically refused to spend any one on one time w me outside of standing in the bathroom and talking to me while I shower. But left her kids with me to babysit for hours multiple times? 

My sister was 35 weeks pregnant with twins when she lost one of the babies suddenly and had to have an emergency c section. I was super upset and decided to tell Lana hoping that she would just be a friend to me, instead she asked me to show her a photo of the baby that didn’t make it and kept staring it and was like “wow that’s so sad I knew a girl who lied about having a stillborn and after seeing these pictures I just don’t know how someone could lie about it” proceeded to talk about it for 20 mins until I left and then share the news with anyone and everyone who would listen. 

Idk if she accused me of trying to SA her to hurt me? In person she said “see your acting guilty, if you weren’t you would’ve come in here and tried to have a civil conversation with me instead of freaking out” 😣 idk who wouldn’t freak out like why are you telling me 10 years later after begging me for years to come and live with you and you sisters and YOUNG kids! Like why in the hell would she ask me to move with her if she felt like I did that to her. 

Then she said “I just want you to sympathize with me because my love for you has absolutely no boundaries, look at what you did and the fact I was able to forgive you and you’re telling me you don’t want to be my friend anymore because of what Jana said C’s family did to him? Really? ”

I’ve been thinking I need to see a therapist, I keep having mental breakdowns and idk who to even call or what to say and I don’t know if I should report this or if my therapist will report this. This will severely impact my schooling, my current job, my ability to see my siblings, everything basically having any kind of “rape allegations” or anything idk how to process this. 

Lana has no other friends, she hasn’t for years. She would get into big arguments with her friends in high school and the whole group slowly dropped her. She ruined her adult friendships being weird, asked one girls husband to be her sperm donor, had an orgy with another of her friends and told the whole town about it, started drama at work with her baby daddy and current husband, etc. 

Lana’s done and said some stuff about her being SA. She said that a bunch of kids would all touch each other when she was little, which is pretty common. But she texted her aunt and cousin that the dad/husband touched her when she was little and the cousin barely talks to her anymore and Lana gets mad that she still talks to her dad. Lana said she “has a feeling that her grandma let people touch her when she was a baby but she doesn’t remember” She admitted to SA her sisters herself to me. She also doesn’t want to report anyone or go to therapy or get any actual help for it, which is the weirdest part to me. And she’s definitely been a little creepy to her mom Tina demanding to see and play with her breasts when she got them augmented, arguing that “I’m her kid, they’re for me”

I don’t want to get to into it too much but I was SA via torture from like 4yo-9yo by someone in my family. I’ve been diagnosed with CPTSD because of it and it affects all of my relationships. I get really reclusive if I get touched too much or if I feel smothered, will consistently take months breaks from people, social media, etc. Because of this also, I try to be as gentle, understanding, patient, etc as I possibly can be with everyone, which is also why this accusation is affecting me so. 

Lana’s whole family is prone to drug and alcohol abuse, including Lana. But so is mine but I’ve been sober sans marijuana from time to time since I was in high school. 

Idk what to think about this, I’m not doing ok at all.

I’m a healthy, 23-year-old-female who is not overweight, exercises regularly, doesn’t smoke, drinks alcohol very rarely, and has no underlying conditions. I have “severe” acid reflux according to my doctor. I am in so much discomfort 24/7 and it’s really starting to affect my mental health. GERD affects every part of my life that is essential to wellbeing: eating, sleeping, exercising, and enjoying doing the things I love. I am seeking any advice on how to alleviate my symptoms. Some more details:

 **My GERD journey**

It started off as flare ups after certain meals or during times of stress here and there from ages 18 to around 22. However, this year, following two particularly bad flare ups, it has been CONSTANT. Acid coming back up my throat every single day.

**My Symptoms**

I may not have all of these at once, but these are how my GERD presents itself for me

* Feeling of something coming back up my throat. When it’s really aggressive, you can hear a noise (help)
* Feeling like there’s something stuck in my throat/lump in my throat
* Pieces of food coming back up my throat after I’ve eaten  
* Dry cough
* Hoarse voice
* Loss of appetite
* Pressure in my ears at the same time the acid is coming back up my throat
* Feeling acid flowing back up my stomach and into my throat when I lay down
* Difficulty swallowing 

 **Other useful info**

I never burp. Idk how common this is or if it’s related. I can probably count on one hand the amount of times I’ve burped in my life and they’ve all been when I fell on my stomach or something like that 

**What I’ve tried to mange my symptoms**

* Cut out trigger foods besides coffee (black) and tea (chai). I’m a law student and need this.
* Pepcid. Doesn’t do anything alone.
* Omeprazle. Works for the beginning of the day and then I get acid breakthrough
* Dexlansoprazole (30 mg). Works for the beginning of the day and then I get acid breakthrough
* Sleep semi-upright
* Eat small meals
* Not eat close to bed

**My next steps**

My doctor recommended I see a GI doctor and potentially get an endoscopy. I got an endoscopy in 2021 and everything was normal for the most part. There was some gastritis.",1,1736473898.0,GERD,1,1.0,False

1hxten7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1hxten7/7_month_old_puppy_might_have_gastritis_possibly/,7 month old puppy might have gastritis :(  possibly? Maybe not. ,"Hello 

My male 7 month old 3 pound Chihuahua puppy ***might*** have some form of gastritis. 

I say some form because I read online how some dogs can get what’s called “stress colitis” 

What’s changed is his sleeping arrangements and he’s very unhappy about it. 
He’s been very spoiled. 

He now sleeps on the floor in a big dog tent on a nice plushy dog bed, with nice plush blankets, instead of with me, in my bed because he likes to pee in my bed in the middle of the night! 

So no more bed for him. 
He can have his own space for the time being until we can fully potty train him. I thought he was…because he had no accidents….so I thought. 

Anyway…today he was acting completely normal until now. 

Pooped blood. Not completely blood, but had blood in it. Ketchup, jelly like.

He had an incident back like this back in October on the 29th but I thought it was because I fed him ham and he had a sensitive stomach so I stopped feeding him ham. And the problem went away. 

Now it’s back again and I haven’t fed him anything besides his usual diet, and to my knowledge he hasn’t gotten into anything he shouldn’t. 

Then..he puked about half a shot glass worth of medium hue red vomit, that was frothy. 

I am of course panicking. 

I called the emergency vet here in town, but they want money…money I do not have. $800 just to be seen. I just paid my rent yesterday. 

They told me I could apply for credit and I did and I was not approved. 

Which really shocked me because just took out a loan with my bank a month ago for a lawyer. And was approved no problem. I’m stilling paying them back though. (I’m not in any legal trouble, it was for a restraining order for a DV situation. He was trying to fight it because if he didn’t fight it he would go to jail it’s typically unusual to hire a lawyer for a restraining order) anyway…

I’m really out of cash….and I applied for the credit and wasn’t approved. 


My baby is playing, and acting normal…besides the obvious of what happened, the reason why I don’t believe it’s something like Parvo is because he isn’t not not drinking or eating or using the bathroom or not playing, or up and walking around and alert…

The reason why I think it might have to do with his belly is because the past few days-week week and half I’ve been hearing very loudly his tummy rumble and gurgle…despite him having plenty of food and eating fine..having an appetite and everything. 

I thought he was going to bust out with crazy diarrhea a few times, but never did. 

Again, he seems very alert, eating drinking and playing. Even after puking (2 hours ago) and having a bloody stool. 

I COMPLETELY understand he needs to see a vet and I don’t disagree AT ALL. 

But what am I suppose to do when my local vets and hospital won’t take me without money? Or credit? Please don’t eat me alive in the comments, I get it, I’m not disagreeing, I WANT to see a vet, I’ve been calling, I’ve been trying to work something out. But none of them so far (currently it’s about to be 9pm) will work with me and my money situation) it’s really all about money where I’m located and less about a pets well being. They won’t even make a payment plan with me! 



I don’t have family to ask for large amounts of cash. 
I can maybe get $30 bucks from them on a good day. If that. 

All the low income second chance vets around me have wait lists. 

Can someone here please help me with some advice for the meantime until I reach a vet who will help us :( 


EDIT: 
I also wanted to add in I cleaned the floors with this new product called “Pinalen” in this floral scent, and it’s thick, and red. 
He also knocked over my coffee the other day and I cleaned it up with that cleaner…I’m wondering if maybe he could of licked that cleaner off the floor even when it was wiped up, or even possibly before?
I don’t know just a thought. 

I also wanted to add his poop smelled terrible. Worse than usual. ",2,1736473838.0,AskVet,2,1.0,False

I’ve always had a very strange reaction to caffeine but it isn’t quite like this.

I can only make it through about 1/4 cup of coffee (sometimes less) before getting sweaty and anxious, but also feeling run down and tired. That run down part gets worse as time goes on too. Sometimes a cup of black tea is enough to have this effect too.

I ask mostly out of curiosity, but also because I just got diagnosed with ADHD after a very comprehensive test. I took my first dose of Vyvanse today (20mg) and it seems to have a similar impact on me as caffeine, except I did have a couple hours where I felt pretty good before getting this anxious exhausted feeling. I never see anything about people reacting to caffeine like me so I’m interested in stories or info from people who know better than me! Thanks.

ETA: I have weirdly found that drinks like redbull do not have this anxiety effect on me. I can drink a whole redbull with alcohol before a night out and go to bed comfortably after. It’s possible there’s still hope for me I guess but I do get impostor syndrome abt reacting to caffeine this way… even tho I was just told I have very severe ADHD with scientific evidence lmao.

In school, I studied French from 1st grade to 12th grade. Then I went to college and forgot about it. Even with all of those years, I couldn’t hold a conversation worth a damn. It has really weighed on me for years, and I didn’t start doing anything about it until recently. I’ve thrown myself back into French with wild abandon (at least at first). After taking a step back, I started looking into STUDYING a language to avoid wasting my time. I researched and made a plan. In order to get to B2 (I’m A2 now mostly because of my terrible listening abilities), I am facing it head on. I started listening to Radio France everyday. While putting dishes away, making my coffee and breakfast, taking a shower, and also just while sitting with my pet. Let me tell you, OMG, the difference between the first day I started listening and now is remarkable. I was legit overwhelmed, very afraid, and feeling crappy about myself because it all sounded way too fast and complicated. I wasn’t hearing any separation of words and was barely hearing anything I knew, even though I know a lot of vocabulary. I reminded myself that I’m experiencing exactly what a baby experiences and decided that I would trust the process. I started at the speed level just below the actual speed. Today I just decided to leave it at the normal speed.

*In addition, I pulled back on my speaking focus (didn’t stop altogether), and went old-school with physical notecards. Every time I hear something I don’t know, I write it down and then come back to it later in the evening to research it and its proper usages. 

I’m listening right now to an interview and I’m beaming with pride. I’m HEARING separate words, words I know, and phrases I understand. I still can’t understand everything, but I sure as hell can understand a lot more than I did when I started my listening routine. I’m so so so happy! I never thought I would even get to this point because it seemed so impossible before. So if you’ve been stuck, please prioritize listening. Once I get through a full month of prioritizing listening, I’m going to begin tutoring, as I think this will make my speaking wayyyyy better. That’s it for now. ",18,1736473189.0,French,6,1.0,False

I, (35F) and my wife (30F) have been no contact with my Nmother for 3 years. My older brother is the last one in low contact with her. The dread has begun for older brother's wedding in a couple months. It's only a 15-20 people dinner. Other attendees include my dad and his girlfriend (no contact but make polite small talk with ma at weddings and funerals) and younger brother who is also no contact with mother. So there's plenty of dynamics and tension as you can imagine.

Now of course, my mother is a classic narcissist and family events are her time to shine. She was such a turd to me and my guests at my own wedding it was my final straw for NC. Also as we know my mother will use whatever happens for years. For example, for years I heard 'Your dad was capable of being nice to me at aunt's funeral so now why won't he go get a coffee with me and we can talk about getting back together (the divorce was 16 years ago folks and he's been with his new partner for 10)'. 


I just know if I'm polite I'll get harassed to 'stop punishing her and make it up to her' and shit talked about no matter what I do to the aunts and uncles. My wife can't stand her and has said she doesn't think she can even put on a friendly face. Mainly because she has seen how I've been treated and wants to stand up for me. I think we should try to grey rock our way through.

Topics that are likely to trigger me and I want help to prepare and practice lines to deflect.


-Do I say Hi first and act unbothered? She will often greet people but pull a face like she's stepped in a wet dog turd then claim that she was the polite one.

- 'You look tired' that has always been one of her go to phrases to undercut me before a conversation even starts. Including at my wedding after 2 hours of hair and makeup when I was looking my best. When I have asked her not to its 'Oh AM I NoT allowed To eXpress Concern'. I want to respond 'perhaps your presence leads to a pattern of strain on my face that you're interpreting as general fatigue but really I'm just fucking tired of interacting with you'........ Yeah I need a line for this one I think. 

-We have a 1 year old she's never met. She doesn't even have the right name for him. I know because she stole photos and made Facebook posts while texting me that I'm punishing her by keeping her away from her precious grandson. I don't want to talk about him at all..   do I just say 'yep, we're pretty busy'

- she's a criminal defence attorney and near every conversation goes back to bragging about her work and how she got this rapist off jail time, or that mother who commited child manslaughter out early.  She knows I was SA growing up. This is a reason I found it so insensitive as it was also a hot topic for her at my wedding dinner. Anyone got anything better than 'Woopdefucking doo' or 'hope he doesn't break into more houses and rape more women I guess.

-ever since I disclosed my SA as a child she seems compelled to tell me my assaulter is having a tough life and is depressed. I think it's some kind of weird consoling? That he's not having a 'great life'. Ok dokey, maybe hes depressed because hes a pedo. Maybe hes worried his multiple victims might press charges. I just don't care or want to hear it and all it does is remind me that she's still in touch with this person. Maybe I can say 'I won't be discussing X tonight'. Although boundaries are like having a red flag to a bull with this woman and I worry that she will double down. 

- Defending my future SIL

Ultimately, I want their big day to be about THEM and not bring up any of this drama. As you have guessed by that a lot of that involves stage managing NM and her reactions, all my life. 

NM thinks she is the bride at every wedding and the corpse at every funeral. She finds ways to pull attention... e.g. wearing white lace to a wedding, a skimpy red dress to a funeral, walking herself down the aisle before the bride and giving unasked for impromptu speeches. My SIL is not very confrontational and I love her. I feel like I would be ready to pour a bottle of red on her outfit or bodily tackle her from the aisle. But I also think I need to tell SIL I'm off duty and just focus on keeping the peace and grey rocking. 

Ok reddit honestly any tips, counting tricks or mindfulness I can practice to get through this event?

As mentioned in our [One in a Million Subs celebration post](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/1haqdvp/one_in_a_million_subs_and_an_rkdrama_puzzle/), we are doing a party game each month as we count down to our subreddit's 15th birthday!

For January's edition of our party game and to continue the celebration of our banner, we are playing Six Degrees of Subway PPL!

[Even THE Goblin ate Subway!](https://preview.redd.it/duk6znblj2ce1.png?width=3857&format=png&auto=webp&s=c19240a790e7084de5df29e223de4ae4a8dcf3e6)

It's easy to play. Each parent comment should name a drama **WITHOUT Subway PPL.** And then reply comments (from other users or yourself) should try to link to dramas *WITH Subway PPL*, ideally within six degrees of separation. Dramas can be linked based on cast members, writer(s), director(s), or filming location.

Example below:

[Example](https://preview.redd.it/5jbhx2jtj2ce1.png?width=1526&format=png&auto=webp&s=e720ea3fdaeb1df7ea0550a74586cc6cc021191a)

If you like to really challenge yourself, you can set further PPL limits on the dramas being used such as using dramas featuring sandwich competitors (Quiznos, Egg Drop) or ones featuring other perennial PPL sponsors such as  coffee shops or Maxim, Dyson, or Kahi.

1hxt0n7,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofattraction/comments/1hxt0n7/the_mindset_needed_in_manifesting/,The mindset needed in manifesting,"This is my take, my experience, and my intuition with manifesting. Ultimately, everything works. It is the emotional conviction you have in the thing working. You decide whether what you're doing is working for you.   
  
Okay, so.   
  
There was a period of time where I had a super good mental diet, where I was basically living in the end all day with my SP. Whenever I had bad thoughts/ was ready to have bad thoughts, I would flip it immediately and I would feel the joy the love everything of having my SP. I was happy. Robotic affirming did make me happy, because I was always living ""in the end"". However, despite that, it look me 4 months to even have the chance to meet my SP. What went wrong? If reality is a mirror of my subconscious, why did 4 months of imprinting my subconscious with SP with little to no opposing thoughts not reflect in my reality?   
  
After a some time of manifesting and studying everything in relation to it, one thing came up recurringly: detachment/ letting go of control. When I finally could meet my SP for a date (2 months after physically seeing him), I decided to let go. I decided that I am not going to think about controlling the situation, because if I could (at the level of manifesting ability I was at), my SP would have conformed already. After a series of events, and deciding ""fuck it, I'll let the universe deal with my SP thing for me"" (I wanted him SO badly), I manifested him. I also decided not to fight what he did in the 3D at all. He got progressively better, and the ""problems"" we had before were no longer problems. However, I was still attached. On some days he would not want to chat, or be mean, or sth (i forgot lol). I did not feel important to him, even though I would stay delulu and tell myself that I am. While I had this surefire method that always brought him back to me, it felt like I had to do it continuously for him to stay with me (it was just visualizing us calling/ being tgt for a few seconds). It did not feel fulfilling. Additionally, I believed that I was living with him, and was subconsciously afraid of the 3D showing me otherwise. Because we would call almost every day, it implied that we were not living tgt. But at the same time, I was afraid to not call him. I was afraid of going back to the days of just imagining him with the 3D showing me absolutely no progress. I love being around my SP. This lasted for 3 months until I watched Soul's Playground.   
  
Soul's playground talks about living in the present moment and allowing emotions, because your heart knows what you want before u affirm for it or whatever. It resonated with me, so I gave it a try. A lot of my self-concept issues resolved itself after I stayed in the present moment. My mind changed itself. Circumstances changed themselves to make me get the right mindset shift. However, this was not the main thing that staying in the present did for me. Staying in the present, allowed me to detach. I realized that I could feel fulfilled and happy without needing sth in particular in the 3D. I realized that I kept needing my imagination/ fantasizing like some sort of pacifier for whenever I feel sad stressed etc. Accepting all the fears, negative thoughts, scary emotions etc., was what freed me. Some time after that, and watching some YouTubers, I realized that we as manifestors, place too much power on the 3D. I do not mean it in an egoic way, where it's like ""Oh dont give your power to the 3D! You are the operant power! You have your SP already! You have the money already! You have all the control!! Take back your control!! Control your reality!!! Affirm to remind urself that blah blah blah"". **I mean it in a sense of you needing 3D representations to make you feel fulfilled.** For example, I need my SP's love to feel good every day. I need the job to make me feel validated etc. You don't need ANY of that.

What you desire is the feeling you get from having your manifestation. And you have that in abundance. You do not need the 3D representation nor the emotion to feel fulfilled within yourself at all. You do not need to place your attention on feeling the love 24/7 to feel fulfilled/ manifest that in your reality. You do not need to focus on having ur SP every day to feel happy. If you're doing that, you are still NEEDING your SP.   
  
I think ""your manifestation is a choice"" has not been explained well enough. It is literally a choice. You can only have what you already have. Your state of being has to be so fulfilled, so naturally detached (from the fulfillment), that nothing is above you. No 3D thing can ever define or be above you. You are only choosing that. A great example is that: you can presented with burgers from McDonalds, Wendy's, Burger King, and Five guys. You already have and can choose any of those burgers freely. Then it becomes a choice of what you prefer. There is no one burger that you particularly need in your life. There is no one burger that u think: Oh if i have this my life will be perfect. Your life is perfect already. You are an infinite being creating infinite realities. You are completely fulfilled. This is what Soul's playground means when she says having no thoughts is the best feeling. Having no thoughts is the ""I am"" Neville Goddard talks about. It is the God state. Being constantly in that fully fulfilled state makes manifesting so much easier, because you don't need anything. Hence, detachment comes naturally. You already have the emotional fulfillment. You don't need 3D representations to show it to you, because 3D representations are only a snippet of your true eternal fulfilment. You no longer feel the need to control, e.g. ""am i affirming enough"" ""am i detached enough"" ""am i doing it right?"" ""oh my negative thoughts are going to affect my manifestation"", because you already feel fulfilled.

In fulfillment, there is nothing you need to get, thus nothing you need to control.   
  
That said, my main point here is that I want to emphasize detachment and its relation to fulfillment. You believe that you need your SP (or your imagination of SP) to be happy, and you justify it by telling yourself that you deserve to have all your desires fulfilled. I agree that you deserve to have all your desires fulfilled, which is why I want to suggest you to STOP needing your SP. Take your mind off it a little and focus on meditating. Or affirm so much that you realize that your SP does not complete you. You'll realize that detaching is the greatest thing you can ever experience. In focusing excessively on your SP or your self-concept (or whatever), you are also focusing on the fact that you need these conjured images to feel happy within you.   
  
One point I would also like to note is that I really hate how many coaches focus so much on getting your desired reality. ""Oh change yourself within. Know that it's done, then the 3D will change ha ha ha"". How can you ever get rid of needing the 3D when you focus so much on changing yourself so that the 3D can change for you??? You never needed the 3D. The 3D can be whatever and you can still be completely and utterly fulfilled. However, one beautiful byproduct is that the 3D reflects who you are authentically. You can never change the 3D by being like ""haha i'm going to trick my subconscious mind by affirming 5000 times"". You can only change the 3D when you authentically, irrationally, and confidently believe in what you decided.   
  
Hence, the real mindset shift is to focus on how you can make yourself feel fulfilled within. I emphasize again. You never needed your 3D to change. You needed yourself to change. You want to feel good. You want to feel loved. You want to feel abundant and free. It's just that we're so used to needing the 3D to change for ourselves to change.

We falsely believe that the illusion (3D) can give us the thing we want. But no. You can give yourself what you want. Right now. Within yourself. Always. It is just an inner knowing. An inner decision. If you want to experience something, sure. Experience that. Boom. You experienced it. You securely have it. One decision is enough (i am not going to get into this. If u want to know more, just dm me).

That said, robotic affirming works. Anything works as long as you have the emotional conviction that it does. But why does robotic affirming work so easily for minor things like getting someone to walk faster, or free coffee, but not for important things like ur SP? Why can coaches like Sammy manifest big things so easily with robotic affirming while you can't? Because they have the right mindset. They know that they are above everything. That no manifestation defines them. They choose the manifestation, but they're good with it and good without it, because they are ALWAYS living in the state of ""I have everything I want"". This is not me telling you to go robotically affirm your self- concept. I am suggesting that you take your mind off the 3D or your desires for a bit, and realize that even your thoughts about ""needing a desire"" are just thoughts. And thoughts are floating clouds. They do not define you or your actions. A state of lack: ""I need my SP"" leads you to want to continuously 'lock in"" ""affirm"" ""try harder"" in self-concept/ SP manifestation etc. A state of fulfillment leads you to know that you already have your SP because you decided and that you're completely fulfilled, regardless of what the 3D shows you. And you remain present and engaged in the 3D because it cannot negatively affect you in any way. You know that your conviction and power are stronger. (Ofc everyone's intuitive action of fulfilment is different. Action follows state of being).  
  
By saying your fulfillment is within, I MEAN your fulfillment is within. Not ""your fulfillment is within"" in the sense that, ok i change my mind/ i brainwash myself, then haha my 3D will be beautiful. You can experience different states of being (e.g. being rich, being loved etc). You can constantly choose them. But you NEVER need them, because you are greater.",2,1736472640.0,lawofattraction,1,0.75,False

I've lost 10-pounds in about 6 weeks by making one change - eating only protein and 2 or 3 dates for breakfast. I attribute the weight loss to this because I have made no other changes in diet or lifestyle. Specifically, I changed from having a baklava square or Olyra bar to whatever protein is available - a chicken drumstick, leftover turkey, liver & onions, canned sardines, you get the idea. The protein portion is what I would call snack-size. Afterward, I eat 2 or 3 dates for some healthy sugar and fiber and because they go great with my pour-over coffee.  
  
I don't have an explanation for this ""hack"" but its efficacy may be in the fact that it erases my lunchtime hunger. So, no more lunch for me. I randomly munch on radishes, celery, carrots, fruit and nuts throughout the day. I also have a 16oz glass of water as soon as I wake up and an another after breakfast. Furthermore, once a day I conscientiously satisfy a hunger pang with only a 16oz glass of water. Please note that these and other habits existed before the singular change to breakfast.  
  
I believe this community is mainly comprised of a variety of people struggling with weight loss. I have never dealt with weight issues but, holding all other factors constant, this change dropped me from 170-pounds to under 160 with no loss in strength or muscle. My understanding is that the last few pounds are the most stubborn (especially after 50), which is why I thought this advice worth sharing. YMMV of course, but if you do give this a try, please comment with your results. All the best.",0,1736472129.0,WeightLossAdvice,1,0.33,False

I have messed up and I don't know how to fix it. 

I'm 25F and do gig work through Rover while I figure out my career after graduating. Most of my gigs are normal - I walk the dog, feed the cats, sometimes I housesit. But one of my gigs has turned into something I don't want and I legit have no idea what to do.

He is a single man in his 30's with an incredibly sweet dog. At first, it was totally professional. He’d leave thank-you-notes and bottled water and candy and stuff. None of my other clients did that but everyone is different and I just thought he was thoughtful and had great manners.

Then it started to get weird. One day when I came over, he worked from home, and invited me to stop and have coffee with him. He started telling me how lonely he’s been and how the older you get the harder it is to meet people. It was awkward, but ofc I didn’t want to be rude, so I just smiled and nodded and tried to keep it low-key.

I hoped that would be the end of it, but it got worse. He texts me a lot. It's always about the dog but it's way too much. He's been booking me for way more hours than the dog really needs and he's home more when I'm there. He bought me a pair of open ear earbuds because he said they would keep me safer in the street. He has a running joke about how he's going to buy me a better coat. He keeps kombucha at his house because he knows I like it 💀

A few weeks ago he came home early with takeout, and insisted I stay and eat with him. Then he asked me a lot of personal questions, and told me some personal stuff about himself. I didn't agree to any of it and I didn't want it but again, I didn't know what to do. 

Now I am getting this creepy feeling that this is starting to be a sugar daddy thing. Even though it's not sexual. I didn't ask for all the extra hours and the attention and the presents, but I am definitely benefiting from them. I'm starting to feel like I'm in his debt and what I owe keeps getting bigger.

I should have shut this down a long time ago and now it feels too late.

I can't see how I could confront him now, because I definitely cannot afford for him to melt down and shame spiral. If he drops me I'm in a lot of trouble because I rely on his gigs to make rent, and he has left me an amazing review that really helps me. I don’t think he would retaliate on me on purpose out of spite, but I do think he would drop me. Because why not? Why would he want me around, reminding him of this embarrassing thing?

What can I do? I need to reset back to professional mode, but I have literally no idea how to do it. ",2,1736472088.0,SexualHarassmentTalk,1,0.75,False

It was sort of a last-minute call after summer last year, because my mom felt like I needed to go to school right after summer, and since I didn't want to go to college, I felt like it was best to go to trade. I'm four months in, and I'm starting to have doubts. I know this is probably the safest option if I want a good career in the long run, but it's not something I'm interested in. I'm mostly doing this for my parents, and it's annoying getting up at the super early in the morning, driving to a school that's almost an hour away, eating away my gas all the time, and then going back home and doing homework that feels like it's for nothing. I want to tell my mom that I changed my mind, but what do I tell her when she asks, ""What are you going to do then?"" I would tell her I would work full-time at this local coffee shop I've been working at for the time being while I work myself out, but she doesn't believe in working at a dead end job. I feel like I'm in a standstill with myself, and it's frustrating I can't bring myself to talk with her because I'm not even good at that. I like to play my guitar, I like music, I like the internet, and I like making video projects for myself using my vintage camcorder; those are just some of my interests. If anyone has read up until this point, I need advice on what I can possibly pursue. I know it's not the end of the world, but it does feel like it when you have a mom that thinks having a lot of money only makes you successful. I don't care about money; I just want to do something that would wake me up in the morning. Thank you if you left something for me in the comments.",2,1736472076.0,teenagers,0,1.0,False

This changed when I discovered Immich some months back! Reliable and easy smartphone sync; easy to set up and maintain even for a noob like me; searching through my images and people even with more precise results than I ever had on google Photos (excuse me wtf how awesome is this!?!?). And all of this impressively fast even on my spinning hardware at home.



That being said - if you share my opinion please consider supporting the developers [here](https://buy.immich.app/) not just to buy them some coffee but also to let them make Immich even better in the [future](https://immich.app/roadmap) (I really look forward to the editor announced for this year)!

Have my first meal after the gym and then the last one at around 6pm or so (of course gotta leave some room for the night snacks). So far I haven’t been feeling very fatigued or anything (although the first week and a half I did experience some tiredness). However for the most part, I’ve been losing weight like crazy. 

I’m just worried that the current intake is too low and I’ll risk losing a lot of muscle. I don’t feel very weak when I train, and I do see some gains in strength. Maybe not as fast as I’d like, but it is getting there. 

I also don’t know if this is sustainable long term. I figured I could do this for 3 months or so and then maybe up the cals but I’m just not sure if that will mess anything up. Am I doing this all wrong?

We’ve been living together for just over 2 years and I finally have had enough. 

So, I am not an easy person to live with, and I know this. I do understand, however, that this is someone else’s house too so I genuinely do try to keep things tidy. Sometimes though the ADHD catches up with me and I forget to throw a plate/cup in the sink or I forget my clothes on the bathroom floor or leave a light on. (ADHD is not an excuse, but sometimes I genuinely just forget/completely miss things). 

My roommate is very much the “this house can’t look like it’s lived in” aesthetic. We both work 50+ hours a week. He wants everything nice and neat and clean- but does nothing to contribute to the household cleaning wise. He tells me that “since I’m the messiest I get to clean it”. 

He will clean his half of things, but if I clean only my half of things it’s an issue. For example- When he washes towels he doesn’t wash washcloths because he doesn’t use them. Okay cool. I washed my towels and washcloths and he started an argument because since I use towels I need to wash ALL of the towels. 

He gets genuinely pissed off and will start arguments over me leaving an empty cup on the coffee table, but he left out FOOD that he cooked for dinner on the stove overnight THAT I PAID FOR and I brought it up he basically told me that “he doesn’t care because he won’t eat left overs” 
…….

I WILL EAT THE LEFT OVERS!! I explained that since we both are poor af I really don’t appreciate him wasting food and it got turned around on me because I should’ve put them away. But the rule in this house THAT HE PUT IN PLACE is if you cook, you put it away and clean the dishes. He doesn’t follow his own rules, but if I did some shit like that it would be WWIII. 

Everyone at work has mentioned to me (we work at the same place) that he talks so much shit about how I’m such a nasty person and I live like a hog and he has to clean up after me all the time. 

YALL I GOT 4 DAYS OFF OF WORK AND DEEP CLEANED THIS ENTIRE HOUSE because I couldn’t take it anymore. I didn’t even get to take a day to rest. He literally DOES NOTHING to help clean this house, but expects me who is on her feet for 10+ hours a day AND has some major back issues to do everything because “I’m the messiest”

As his beard hair is all over the bathroom sink, as half of his clothes are hung up right above the washer and I have to fight them every time I need to wash clothes, as his piles of random shit is piled up in random places downstairs, as his mail is strung all over the coffee table, as LAST NIGHTS DINNER IS SITTING ON THE FUCKING STOVE ROTTING BECAUSE HE CANT BE FUCKING BOTHERED TO DO ANY FUCKING THING IN THIS HOUSE. 

Y’all I GENUINELY am about to lose my fucking mind over this shit. All I do in my free time is clean. Dishes/kitchen, sanitize our living spaces, shared laundry, vacuum, bathrooms, etc because in his mind if you keep it looking clean, it is clean. AND THATS NOT HOW THAT WORKS. Just because the bathroom looks clean doesn’t mean it is???? That toilet hasnt been scrubbed in 2-3 months, but it *looks* clean so its fine???? DISGUSTING. 

I can’t. And every single time I bring it up it gets turned back on me and how “I need to clean it because I’m the messiest”. How he shouldn’t have to lift a finger because he is neat and tidy so he shouldn’t have to bother. ",1,1736471020.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I recently added a very low pressure water line and a float valve into my coffee machine to remove the need to fill it up manually. However, I'd also love to tee off this low pressure water line and run it into my fridge to make a permanently filled fresh water dispenser, as I have a spare float valve left over, and love having readily available chilled water.

The only problem is, the fridge has no built in water inlet. It's an in-column design. I can run the same 8mm tube into the back of the cabinet that the fridge is in. I'm currently considering compressing or cutting a small amount of the flexible seal around the edge of the fridge so the hose could be run in through the top of the door without being compressed. I feel like this can be done without hurting the thermal efficiency of the fridge too much.

So me and my ex broke up about 2 years ago due to LDR. I had went overseas to complete a masters and, during that time, life became very busy. I started to put less and less into the relationship as I was struggling to balance my new life and eventually, she had enough and broke it off. We had such an amazing connection and strong relationship, and she gave me so much patience and pushed me to go get my masters, knowing it’d be difficult for both of us. I’ll forever be grateful for her and I have a lot of appreciation for her too.

We tried to stay in touch after the break up, as friends, but I began to realize it was too much for me and it was keeping me stagnant, so I asked for no contact. During our period of “no contact”, she would reach out to “see how I was doing” but this would start a cycle of us talking and getting close, me asking if there would ever be another chance, her saying she isn’t ready, and then no contact again. We did this a couple times before the last time (7 months ago) when I was extremely fed up and told her that I don’t want to speak to her again for quite some time and to stop contacting me completely. Well, I cut off all lines of communications and that was that. I moved back home and was ready to start fresh, although it was hard moving on initially. 

Well, fast forward to last week. Up until now, I had gone on plenty of dates, started a new job, and am in the process of becoming credentialed in my profession. I had just started seeing someone new a couple months ago (nothing official) which was going well up until I realized she just wasn’t for me anymore. Then my friend messaged us asking what we were up to this weekend. It was his girlfriend’s birthday and his girlfriend happened to be my ex’s best friend, so the plan was to have a get together at my ex’s before going out to a salsa club for the night. It’s been 7 months at this point and I felt very over my ex, so I decided why not?

The night of, I’m extremely nervous. I hadn’t seen my ex in almost a year and I was pacing around my room for at least an hour prior. It was time to get going and so I got on the train and started heading down to her place with the plan to meet a couple friends prior to getting to her condo. On the train down, I decided to message her. I figured it’d be the polite thing to do and it’d break the ice a little bit before we actually saw each other. When she responded, it turned out she messaged me a couple months prior to wish me a happy birthday, and then  again a couple weeks earlier asking to meet for coffee. I hadn’t gotten the messages because I had a new phone number. We texted a bit and then I got off the train.

When I got to hers, it just felt easy to talk to her. I felt confident in myself because I just didn’t have any hope of anything coming out of us meeting. I was my complete self and was able to get along with her friends easily, just like I did when we dated. The night progressed and we ended up getting to the club. We all had a couple more drinks and everyone was feeling good. I tried my best to stay away from my ex so it wouldn’t look like I was trying anything on her, but we’d always find our way back next to each other, talking and catching up. Eventually we broke away from the group and found a place to really catch up. We talked about family, life, and just got a good update on what each other was doing. I showed her pictures of my nieces and nephew that she met on the day they were born. It was honestly a wholesome experience. After 30 minutes, the bouncer came and kicked us out of the reserved section we were sat in, so we went back to the group. We kept talking up until the “main event” at the club began and the dance floor was cleared off to watch the real dancers come out and perform. I was standing behind my ex during this. As the show started, my ex leaned back against me and reached for my hand to hold. My heart sank and I got butterflies. I reached my arm around her shoulders and held her close, both of us rested our heads on each other.  Eventually we turned to face each other and looked into each others eyes, smiling just like we used to. I told her how much I missed her and she said the same. We kept watching until the event was over and the dance floor opened up again. Then we danced with each other and I got to hold her tight again. She had her arms around me and as we looked at each other again, she leaned in for a kiss. Everything about that night just felt so coincidental but comfortable. The club was right on the street she used to live on while we were together, we used to pass by it wondering what the vibe was like inside. Getting to hold her again just felt like something I’d been missing for so long, I hadn’t felt the same way with anyone I’d seen during our time apart. Finally the night ended, we all went our seperate ways, and that was that.

The next day. We messaged a little bit, but there was no mention of the night before from either of us. I asked her for coffee and she agreed, saying it’s definitely a good idea but her week is busy so perhaps in the following week (which happens to be her birthday week). I said sure, to just let me know. And then nothing. The day came and went and nothing. So the next day, I asked her if we could call because I just wanted to know what she thought of Saturday. And she told me the same things I felt. She talked about how comfortable and amazing it all felt. How she finally felt like she could just “breathe” when I was holding her. We laughed at how bad we must’ve looked dancing, and our drunk kiss that we shared. But at the end of her spilling her feelings about that night, she told me that she gave into her wants rather than thinking logically about it all. She explained that she takes a relationship with me very seriously because of how much I mean to her, but she just can’t do that right now. She has aspirations of getting further in her career and going back to school, and she just can’t balance the stress of a relationship with the stress of all that. I understand what she’s saying because I’ve been there, and am currently there too. I told her that I learned a lot from our break up, and that a good relationship with good communication could be a support for her during this difficult time, rather than a burden. But she disagreed. I asked her to think on it, and I’d do the same, but at the end of the day I’m not going to try and convince her of this. If she feels that this is the right decision for her, then she’s got to do what she has to. The call ended and we haven’t spoke for a couple days now. The coffee date is next week but I’m not sure if that will still happen, I decided to leave that in her court.

I wrote this long story out just to sort of vent a bit, and maybe get some perspective. I’m not sure how to move forward on this situation and honestly, I’m quite sad about it. Part of me trusts what she’s saying, but part of me just feels like a drunk and comfortable mistake. So I think it’ll take a few days to get back to normal.

I have always heard so much about claremont and his x-men but was never able to get it, thing is at the end of november/ beginning of december went with a friend to a comicbook shop because he wanted to pick some comics up and ended up in one of the few that actually bring imports from other countrys and there i see it, first X-men omnibus spanish edition (in spain is called La patrulla X) and when i first saw it i stood still and was like 30 secs standing there just looking at it, then i started to browse for other things. 

My friend goes, picks up his comics and mangas and then he comes to get me and of course i was looking at the x-men omnibus again, and when he caughts me looking at it he says ""you should buy it man you know you want it"" and i said ""yeah but i can't be sure they'll bring the next volumes"" so he looks at me like saying ""i got you man"" and says ""just get it"", so i got it (as it turns out i overpayed way too much for it but oh well what you gonna do) and when we get out we go to a coffee shop and we sat down to have a snack and he tells me about a website where i can get all the omnis i want and it sells it in my country coin and everything. 

One month later the second omnibus comes out in spain (19 of december) so i ordered it the 20th and tuesday arrived.

Now for the reading part (sorry i know this is getting long) i went thru the first omni and while i didn't love it it had its moments, for example when colossus is have doubts and wolverine breaks the machine and gets up with him and says (if you don't stop this we both die), or when alpha flight (god i love alpha flight i really enjoy the issues where they appear) arrest wolverine and cyclops (having a rivalry with wolvie and all) says he doesn't care what canda goverment says and wants to rescue logan, or (and for my this was the peak moment for me) when proteus beats up the entire group and cyclops starts a fight with logan because he sees logan is afraid, and i really think that proteus saga is when claremont started taking flight.

But at this point i wans't sure if i should keep going or not, but i decided to give it one more omni since dark phoenix and days of future past were there. The day that the second omni arrived after dinner i started reading (maybe like 12am) and went thru the entire dark phoenix saga without stoping when i read the final issues of dark phoenix i looked thru the window and the sun was coming up and i was really glad i kept going. 

Can't wait for the 3rd omni in april, anyway thanks for reading and sorry for my Bad english!

Decided to go with the ER for $70 since this was the most reasonably priced and it’s not readily available back home. 

The nose is strong and smells sweet. The taste is exceptional with strong hints of cherry, vanilla, and oak. It drinks very nicely neat even out of a coffee cup. I would rate it as a strong 9/10. ",101,1736470297.0,whiskey,40,0.95,False
