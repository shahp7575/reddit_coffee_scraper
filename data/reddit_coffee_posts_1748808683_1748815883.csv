I first noticed that when the bike was cold, revving it to 1–2k RPM would cause it to shut off, and it took a few cranks to restart. I let my friend ride it and he stalled it—again, it took 10–15 seconds to start back up.

Yesterday, after grabbing coffee, the bike wouldn’t start. I checked the fuses and eventually got it running after about 30 minutes of turning the key on and off multiple times.

This morning it wouldn’t start again. I’ve cleaned the starter relay, and it has a brand new battery, iridium spark plugs, and a new air filter.

Any ideas what the issue could be? Maybe fuel-related?

**Update:** Gave it one more shot at starting—this time there was a massive pop from the exhaust, sounded like a gunshot, lol. I’m guessing all the unburnt fuel finally ignited. Hopefully nothing got damaged in the process… but it still wouldn’t start.",1,1748815784.0,motorcycle,0,1.0,False

I don’t feel very hungry but I feel like annoyed in my body/ being? 

I drank a premier protein shake and had a mini bag of baked lays 

( my options are kinda limited because I’m at the ICU with my mom she’s very sick and the cafeteria is half closed for now ) 

I had like half a bowl of cereal and a coffee this am. Could this be because I’m
used to eating more cals?

I don’t like the feeling making me kind of nervous. 

I took my first dose yesterday of .25",1,1748815770.0,Semaglutide,1,1.0,False

Cause and effect

1. For each pair of variables, identify a possible causal relationship using the following relationship options:
- cause and effect relationship 
- common-cause factor
- reverse cause and effect relationship 
- accidental relationship
- presumed relationship 

Explain your choice. (There may be more than one answer. Just argue for the one relationship you chose). Remember that the statement refers to “y-axis” versus “x-axis”. It may help to draw a sketch of the relationship to discuss the causality. 

a) the sales of ice cream have a strong positive versus the success of the corn harvest. 
- Common-cause factor
- Temperature causes both

b) the number of security measures increases as the world experiences more terrorist 
attacks.
- Cause and effect 
- Security increases due to more attacks

c) the price of chocolate increase as the price of coffee also increases. 
- Common cause factor
- Taxes on goods

d) the amount of air pollution decreases as the sale of small cars sales increases. 
- Cause and effect
- Small cars use less fuel so air pollution decreases

e) anxiety over a math assignment increase as the temperature outside increases.
- Presumed relationship
- Heat can cause more anxiety, but the anxiety could be because of the math

I would love to know if anyone else has lived this experience and if they have found anything that helps. I am desperate. Some days, like today, I start crying because I so desperately crave some wholesome interaction or time in the sun with another human being.

I know I will not be justifying most of the following statements. Part of the issue I have had with therapy so far is the amount of time that is spent having to explain that my observations are valid. So for this moment, please assume I am accurate and being honest in my descriptions of myself, my situation and the people around me. I would be happy to expand in the commons, but if your only goal is to find inaccuracy, then this post will just be another dead end in my search for answers. If you are requesting additional context, please explain why you think it would help. I would love a direct criticism of how I can escape this.  

I am a 36yo male, and I have three sisters. My relationship with my parents is complicated. I believe they love me, but they tend to have ulterior and selfish motives when dealing with their children. This mostly takes the form of them offering things with monetary value like dinner, gifts or travel, only to guilt my sisters and I for years because they want us to serve their beck-and-call at their convenience. This has resulted in a number of “blow out” fights between my mother and other people, myself included. This usually involves a lot of attempts from her to rally people against you, normally making up lies about how you hurt her and how she is the victim. Due to this cycle of aggression and selfishness, my sisters and I keep a “strategic distance” from my parents, planning trips to see them that are no longer than a week, and then not returning for 6 months or a year. This allows for an appropriate cooldown on my mother’s part.

Unfortunately, this has resulted in my sisters and I having a loving, but distant connection with each other. In brief, if I said I was going to hurt myself, they might want to talk on the phone for an hour, otherwise it’s just friendly banter via text message. I have tried many times to increase the intimacy with them, but I think they are all justifiably guarded, and I may be in some ways as well. (And if you are curious, they have this with each other as well, 

One person I was always able to be open with was my grandma. Technically she was my step-grandma, but I think I felt like she understood my dilemma as she loved my mom as well, raising her since the age of 12, but not being her biological mother,  and having a number of “blow out” fights with my mother the last 40 years. 

I explain everything above to illustrate that I have some “family support”, but that it comes with a cost, and even then it’s complicated. I like to think of myself as a fairly simple person when it comes to my needs. I just need a few close friends, enough money to make ends meet, and little extra money for hobbies and what not.

Four years ago, I would say I had those needs met in many ways. Like I was able to build a sense of family regardless of my upbringing. I had a job with 5ish people that I got along well with (men and women), I had a wife (no kids),  my youngest sister was living with us (still not much intimate talk, but I love having her company), and finances were doing ok.  Life wasn’t always this good, and it wasn’t always perfect (life always had ups and downs), but I was able to have moments of reprieve in this little oasis I made. I had built this life with a lot of work and consistency, and I liked the direction things were going. 

Skip forward two years (2023ish), things really started falling apart, little by little. My sister moved out of state (no big deal). My wife and I had always had some issues with her being angry and emotionally abusive (This started small at first, and I should have recognized it sooner. Despite this, she has other good qualities, and we enjoyed similar pass times.), but I started feeling like we weren’t making progress with her mental health, so I told her if she wasn’t going to start taking her anger and abusiveness seriously, then we should probably look at separating. At the time, I thought this would help us, but it basically made her outbreaks worse. I wasn’t aggressive about this statement, and I was always framed in a “lets work on this together” way (not just in that first moment, but over months of talking). We spent a year or so of this until we decided that we needed to get divorced (we have been married for about 10 years). Soon this resulted in me living in an apartment alone, ending my nights by myself. I also went through a lot of berating during this time, and there is an easy comparison to be made between these years and the struggles I had with my mother growing up. My point being, this was not a time of being “built up” or “feeling supported”.

Luckily, I had people close to me at work, so 5 days a week I could go in and put the stress out of my mind. If I was really stressed about home stuff, I had people at work I could talk to, and sometimes even go hang out with after work (generally beer or video games). I was hoping that things with my wife would work out, so I kept the issues a secret from my family and most friends during that time because I didn’t want to “shame” my wife. Having these trusted work people really helped a lot with my healing, and I am so grateful I had them when I did. 

I work an office job for a company with branches all over California. At the beginning of 2024, the corporate branch of the company made a company-wide change that resulted in those “5 people I could talk to” getting reduced to “1 person I could talk to” (most were basically laid off). This change caused the overall office-staff-count changing from 15-20 people working in the building everyday, to being cut down to 5 or so. I continued to confide in that 1 person pretty regularly, but as our work load was now doubled, I had additional stress and less time to talk casually.

In Oct of 2024, it was announced that that 1 person was being moved an hour away to start a new branch at the beginning of the new year (2025). Great for her, but it weighed on me every day for the next 3 months.

To add insult to injury, my grandmother very abruptly developed dementia in Aug of 2024, and passed away early Nov 2024. ( I don't know why it matters, but I didn’t get to say goodbye to her. I was told by other people that tried to talk with her in those final day that she didn’t recognize them, and she became angry at them, and they regretted trying. I listened to them. Now I regret not trying to speak with my grandma when I had the chance…) I don’t think she even knew about my divorce. I would have loved to open up about it, but I had still not revealed it to everyone in my family.

As of 2025, we now have about 4 people in the office building. That one person I was close to is gone now, and the other 3 in the building are new people (they’re fine, and I don’t dislike them as coworkers, but they all are 20-30 years older than me). Some days I am literally in a big building alone by myself. And even if I’m not literally alone, I have no one to confide in, and no one to let loose with. 

To add to this issue, for whatever reason, people seem to be moving away from the town I live in. All for different reasons. Jobs, school, moving closer to girlfriends/boyfriends, (litter sister moved to Texas for no particular reason), moving closer to parents, moving to buy an affordable house, etc… Currently, the nearest a friend lives to me now is 30 minutes away.

I wake up alone, I work alone, I come home alone, most weekend time is spent alone. The only regular social interaction I get is by playing video games with those same work friends online, and it’s hard to pin them down to make that happen.

I know that only I am the only one that can fix this, and I am not saying “I’ve tried everything”, but I am trying, very hard. I try to get out on walks, sit at coffee shops, be open to talking to strangers, but it’s not building new bonds with people. I feel like I’ve tried everything (at least a few times) other than going back to school, which I may do if I can figure out money (I have been living paycheck to paycheck after the divorce). I have had people say “why don’t you join a club”, but most clubs in my area are biking and hiking related, and those are not really my interests (although I have considered doing it regardless). Last Friday, I was feeling particularly alone, I had few drinks, and I saw Jehovah's Witnesses across the street, and I APPROACHED THEM just to see what they were all about and to have a real conversation. ( That might come off the wrong way, I am not judgmental to their beliefs, and I do find faith and theology interesting. I was really just talking with them. Not debating or something. My point is that in retrospect, I see how desperate I was for interaction at that moment.) 

I also realize that I should not only be looking for others to fill this hole in my life. Over that last year I have gone back to a number of hobbies as well as adopted new ones. I read, paint, code (mostly web stuff, but I have been trying to learn Unity), I watch artsy movies, 3d model, 3d print, work on my car, write, and I’m sure a lot more. The reality is, I really wish I had people to share with /  show what I’ve been working on to. Unfortunately, I do spend some time getting sucked into YouTube and Instagram Reels (too much for my taste, but it’s an addiction, I am not as bad as some others). Reels especially have a way of hacking my brain, because I can share them to people, and sometimes I later get a notification that they “liked” it. I sometimes look back through the conversation thread I had with them and realise I have sent them over 20 Reels and they haven’t replied yet, then I feel embarrassed. I’m just blowing them up with a long list of things to watch that they probably have no interest in.

I have told friends I’m struggling with this in life. That I feel lonely. I have told my sisters. Some times (rarely) someone checks in with me, normally by sending a text message that says something like “how are you doing, I’ve been thinking about you”, but it normally feels more like “suicide watch” (figuratively) than an invite to get some coffee, or go for a walk, or even just chat on the phone for a few minutes, and especially not an invite to a weekend adventure. 

I promise I’m not always a downer with people, I know when to keep it light. In fact, I think it’s possible that people assume that because I’m trying to “bounce back” and that “I want help, but I don’t want to be a burden” that I am not in real need. 

Something that has really gotten under my skin over the last 6 months is how when people do give me an opportunity to open up about my struggles, they’ll reply something like “at least you never had kids” when I want kids and worried my opportunity is gone. So I will ask what they did with their weekend, and they will be like “I went to the beach with my kids, it was fun. Here’s a bunch of pictures and memories I have.” Then they will ask “what did you do this weekend”, and I’ll say “I was planning on spending some time with a friend, but they cancelled last minute, so I kind of sat around, got some cleaning done, put a few hours into a coding course” and they’ll be like “wow, I wish I had time to do nothing, that’s my favorite thing to do.” It feels like people literally can’t understand my situation.

I try to initiate events with friends, and I always either get “yeah, but this is a bad month” (and the good month never rolls around) or “yeah, let's do it this weekend”, then I spend the whole week looking forward to it just for them to cancel an hour or so before. And I am not exaggerating, I haven’t had anyone follow through with “ event plans” in over a year. To be honest, I think everyone has meaningful lives without me, and no room to add me in.

I don’t know what to do. I can neither get my current loved ones engaged, and I can’t find new people to make connections with. I feel like the last option I have is to grab my friends (or sisters) by the shirt collar, with tears running down my face and yelling “I’m dying, and I’m alone and no one cares!”. Unfortunately for me, whether this feeling is wrong or not, I have too much pride/shame to actually try to make people engage this way. For some reason I don’t want to spend time with me if it’s only out of pity for me.  

When I first started therapy, I was hoping they could see an issue in myself that I was unable to see. I am in no way against therapy, but I entered it worried “is another person going to be able to help me with this”. I had never tried one-on-one talk therapy until about 3 months ago. I understand that it’s potentially about finding the “right fit” therapist, but I think I can only make one more switch before I have to start making a special request to my insurance provider to change, and I don’t know how many attempts I can make before I lose faith in therapy all together. (Meaning, I can’t keep shuffling the deck over and over.) 

The first therapist I worked with was an older woman, who I felt wasn’t listening to me. I would explain things similarly as I have above and she would say things like “Maybe go sit at a coffee shop”, “have you tried talking to your friends about this?”. I stopped correcting her after two or three times of me saying “yeah, that’s what I was saying I have been doing”. I met with her for 3 sessions before leaving. 

The woman I have now is much better, closer to my age, and I believe she is listening and cares, but I believe the way she envisions me improving is basically to “find myself”. Which, if I’m honest, I think I know myself fairly well, but I can accept that maybe I don’t. If I don’t, I would need direct guidance to what I might be missing, because I’m currently drawing a blank. She never has any feedback for this. Any questions I have generally get replies like “well you’ll understand that once you know yourself better.” I feel like I’m being clear with her that this situation and feelings are new for me, I regularly say “I don’t understand what I’m doing wrong”, and that I’m in crisis. I get that many other patients that are struggling are “lacking perspective”, or “not working on themselves”, but I don’t feel like I’m being seen as “working with what I have and failing”. I feel like I’m working hard to reverse this life trend, and like I’m cursed, just getting more bad news.

For better or worse, I feel like she wants me to stop wanting human interaction. Essentially to feel content to have my hobbies, pass-times and myself. But humans are social creatures, I can’t imagine I am wrong for struggling with these feelings and thoughts. I feel justified to feel “defeated, beaten down and hopeless” when I am doing the rest of “life’s homework”, but seeing none of the supposed benefits. And when talking to her, I can’t help but feel the same sense of alienation I get from my friends and family that “envy that I don’t have kids, and did nothing with no one this weekend”.

And to risk this being an abrupt ending, having no family to talk to, no friends to lean on, and having therapists either ignore what I’m saying or to just say “find happiness in the things you’re struggling with” is leaving me feeling like I have no place in this world. Would I be better off just removing the therapy from the struggle? I feel so alone, I am literally alone, and no one seems to understand or care. Is there anyone else in this world struggling with things like this? ",1,1748815523.0,TalkTherapy,1,1.0,False
1l11baj,https://www.reddit.com/r/summariseme/comments/1l11baj/20250601_health_headlines_june_1st_wellness/,(2025-06-01) Health Headlines June 1st - Wellness Breakthroughs,"## Health News Roundup: Summer Heat, Mental Health Misinformation, and Medical Breakthroughs

The health landscape over the overnight to early morning period of June 1st, 2025, offers a mix of practical advice, concerning trends, and promising developments in medical research. From combating the summer heat to navigating the complexities of mental health support and exploring innovative medical treatments, several key themes dominate the news cycle.

**Staying Safe in the Summer Heat:**

Dr. Shriram Nene, a cardiothoracic surgeon, has provided some helpful advice on how to stay safe during the summer heat. He emphasizes that staying cool is crucial for health, as dehydration, fatigue, and heatstroke pose real risks. His recommendations include drinking sufficient water before feeling thirsty – suggesting 3.7 liters for men and 2.7 liters for women – and avoiding sugary drinks and alcohol, which can worsen dehydration. This advice is particularly relevant as global temperatures continue to rise, making heat-related illnesses a growing concern.

**Mental Health Concerns: Misinformation on Social Media:**

A concerning trend highlighted by a Guardian investigation reveals the spread of misinformation on social media platforms like TikTok, where people often turn to for mental health support. The investigation found that over half of the top trending videos offering mental health advice on TikTok contain misinformation. This includes the promotion of dubious advice, quick-fix solutions, and unsubstantiated claims. Examples of this misleading content include suggestions like eating an orange in the shower to reduce anxiety, endorsing supplements with limited evidence for alleviating anxiety, and presenting normal emotional experiences as signs of serious disorders. This emphasizes the need for critical evaluation of online content and for individuals to seek guidance from qualified mental health professionals.

**The Impact of Coffee on Medication:**

The influence of everyday lifestyle choices on medication efficacy has also been highlighted. Research suggests that coffee consumption can interfere with certain medications, potentially reducing their effectiveness or increasing the risk of side effects. The caffeine present in coffee is the main culprit, and can impact a variety of medications.  While tea also contains caffeine, it doesn't seem to affect people the same way. This underscores the importance of understanding potential drug interactions and consulting with healthcare providers regarding lifestyle choices while taking medication.

**Dietary Considerations and Feeling Uneasy After Breakfast:**

Additionally, the news emphasizes the importance of being mindful of food consumption, particularly in the morning. While many might rely on a quick breakfast to start the day, some foods can be problematic. It's suggested that salads, which are generally healthy, might not be the best choice first thing in the morning due to the difficulty the body has digesting raw vegetables, which may cause bloating, gas, and abdominal pain.

**Medical Advancements and Research:**

The health news features several promising advancements in medical research.

*   **Sunlight as a Therapeutic Agent:** Scientists are making surprising discoveries about the potential of sunlight to treat diseases. This research opens up new avenues for developing innovative treatments.

*   **Mitochondria: The Cell's Motherboard:** Research emphasizes the crucial role of mitochondria, the energy-producing organelles within cells. They are more than just powerhouses; they are fundamental to overall health and well-being. When mitochondria thrive, so do we.

*   **Affordable Cancer Treatment:** Dr. Rajendra Badwe, director of Mumbai’s Tata Memorial Centre, is pioneering efforts to make cancer treatment more affordable. He is revolutionizing treatment standards by repurposing readily available drugs. His work provides new directions in the treatment of breast cancer patients and is gaining international recognition.

**Health Calculators and Risk Assessments:**

The availability of online tools to help people assess their health risks is featured. The news includes information about the Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator, designed to quantify tissue mass and categorize individuals based on their height and weight. It emphasizes that being overweight can increase the risk of developing heart disease and other health problems. The news also mentions a Type 2 Diabetes Risk Calculator which assesses the likelihood of developing the disease within the next decade. People are able to maintain a healthy lifestyle by regular exercise and a balanced diet.

**Broader Implications and Context:**

The news summaries also touch upon broader themes that affect the health landscape. The rise of social media as a source of health information highlights the need for greater public health literacy and media awareness. Misinformation can have severe consequences, especially in mental health, where vulnerable individuals may be misled by unscientific claims. The information provided reinforces the importance of consulting qualified medical professionals for accurate diagnoses and treatment plans.

Overall, the health news for this period paints a picture of a complex and rapidly evolving landscape. It underscores the importance of preventative measures, informed lifestyle choices, and the need to stay abreast of cutting-edge research. From practical advice to combat the summer heat, to the latest medical breakthroughs, a focus on individual well-being, supported by scientific knowledge and responsible information dissemination, remains vital.

1l119pj,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1l119pj/how_to_dealing_with_constant_dating_disappointment/,How to dealing with constant dating disappointment,"Honestly, my bad luck in dating is almost comical at this point. I'm self-aware enough to know that if I keep striking out, look at the common denominator so I even took some time out after my last relationship ended to look at my patterns (conflict resolution was definitely something that needed working on).

I tentatively rejoined the dating scene and whether it's people I've meet IRL or via OLD, here is what I've experienced in the past 6mos:

1. Bump into a friend I've known since our teen years randomly for the first time in years. He'd asked me out a few times over the years but either I'd always been in relationships or he had. So I think ""maybe now's our time"". I message him and he shoots me down saying he's not a back up and then blocks me, even though there were other times when we spoke and he was in relationship and we didn't entertain it further, but still ended convo on a positive note.
2. Matched with a guy online. Spoke for a week or so. Both keen to hangout but he keeps trying to meet last minute which I decline as I'm genuinely busy. Some internet sleuthing (we'd exchanged IGs at this point) later revealed he got back with his gf like a week later.
3. Matched with a guy online, seems promising. My response-times slow down as I get busy with life and I'm about to go on vacation. We agree to meet upon return. I follow up when I'm back and get ghosted. Even though we never connected on IG, I've caught him watching my stories.
4. Meet a guy at a library coffee-shop. The guy gives off chill, laidback and interesting vibes. I can tell he's younger but figure it's worth hanging out and giving it a chance. We exchange IGs and arrange to check out an art gallery a few days later. Chemistry and banter is definitely there. We establish the age-gap and it doesn't phase him. The date is quite short and I don't extend it because I had a throat operation recently and I'm still building my appetite back up. He asks me if I want to hangout again and I enthusiastically agree and tell him to also keep me updated about any upcoming gigs (he's a musician) of his. Usually I text a post-date msg but I can tell he's not the texting type. A few hours later I find he's unfollowed me.

I know rejection is redirection but it's really starting to make me feel hopeless that not a single situation is working out, especially as I'm in my mid-30s and already feel judged for being single/childless. I can't help but wonder if it's something I'm doing wrong, like maybe I'm not showing enough interest? I'm definitely more of a slow-burner with relationships advancing (I've done the whole 0-100 relationships and they just end up crashing and burning). Prior to this recent spurt of bad luck though, I've never had issues before with this dating strategy or faced this much rejection. ",2,1748815409.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

16th May
The city of Kormos woke up to rain.
 It usually did.
Some say, if it ever woke to sunlight, it would be a sign of the apocalypse.
Angelica Proud sat in her car, crawling toward the office. Traffic was slower than usual—some poor bastard had managed to burn out a truck right in the middle of the main road.
“Another day, another fool under the ground.”
As she passed the wreck, she caught a glimpse of the logo on the charred metal: a tuna with a baseball bat. Rosaro Brothers’ canning company.
That made it the third time one of their trucks went up in smoke this year.
“Someone’s not paying their cut. Or someone wants a bigger piece of the market.”
She made it just in time. Barely.
Quick mirror check. Hair adjustment.
Nothing extraordinary—but Angelica knew her assets.
Long wavy blonde hair, the kind that looked “accidental.”
A neckline deep enough to catch a man’s eye, but tasteful enough to let his imagination do the rest.
The rain, for once, had taken a coffee break. She managed to reach the building dry—miracle enough.
Her first stop was the front desk.
“Any letters, packages, messages for me?”
“Just one dinner invitation. Tomorrow, maybe?”
“You know I have a husband, right?”
“Yeah. And he’s real understanding about your late-night meetings with the mayor. Just the two of you. Twice a week.”
“Shut up. Not another word.”
“Of course. Have a great day!”
She rolled her eyes and walked off.
“Five minutes in and I’m already out of patience.”
In her office, she flipped through her calendar.
Meetings. Post office run. Lunch with the mayor. Another late one tonight.
She was already trying to think of a good excuse—when a knock came at the door.
The mayor stepped in.
Still annoyingly handsome, even in his mid-fifties. Half-elf genes, she figured.
Their eyes met.
Maybe she was in the mood after all.
“About tonight.”
“Yes, Mister Mayor?”
“We’ll have to postpone. There’s a dinner I need to attend at the Mary-Antoine Hotel.”
“Of course, sir.”
He studied her face for a moment.
“Something wrong?”
“That prick Brad at reception. I think he knows.”
“Knows what?”
“Us.”
“My dear, you worry too much. Your services are part of something greater. For the good of the city. And Brad? He should be thankful he’s allowed to be near real work. I’ll talk to him.”
“It’s nothing. Really”
“I insist. Anyway, I must run. We’ll talk later.”
He left.
Angelica leaned back in her chair, oddly relieved.
Maybe, just maybe, there was still something left of her marriage. Somewhere.
Later that day Angelica did her post office run. Her luck ran out, she returned soaking wet. As a practical citizen in Kormos, she always had a change of clothes in the office. She started to get free of her wet clothes when an unwanted noise reminded her that the door was left open. If it was not terrible enough, Brad stood in the doorway, jaw dropped.
“For fuck sake, do you know what knocking means?”
“I’m sorry, a package arrived for you.”
Brad raised the box in his hands.
“Where can I put it?”
“Desk. Then get out!”
He walked in, dropped the box, turned... but didn’t leave.
He closed the door instead.
Angelica tensed.
“You look gorgeous.”
“Thanks. Now get out. I’m changing.”
“I want you.”
“...Excuse me?”
“I’ve wanted you since the day I met you.”
He moved around the desk.
Angelica backed away.
“Brad leave now or I scream.”
He didn’t.
But before it could spiral, Angelica reacted.
A sharp elbow. A loud shout.
Enough.
The door burst open.
Apolonio.
He saw everything.
Brad backed into the wall like a cornered rat.
“Sir, I’m sorry… It was a bad joke.”
The mayor approached with terrifying calm.
Those who’d shaken his hand said it felt like testing how long a neck would last in his grip.
Brad found out.
Angelica said nothing.
She watched the color drain from Brad’s face as the mayor’s fingers did their work.
Moments later, the body dropped like a rag doll.
Apolonio turned to her.
She was still only half-dressed.
“I’m sorry Sir. Let me fix this”
She grabbed her dry clothes, while the mayor gently put his hands on her back.
“Did you want it?”
“What?”
“Him.”
“No. I was scared.”
“Good.”
His grip tightened.
“You’re mine Angelica. No other man touches you.”
Angelica wasn’t sure if what she felt was fear, disgust… or relief.
“Sir… I have a husband. I have… responsibilities.”
The mayor pointed his eyes towards Brad’s lifeless body.
“Then I hope you’ll have a good excuse. For his sake.”
Then he kissed her.
Cold. Possessive. Final.
“That package is from me. I have to bring someone with me tonight for the meeting. Be ready by eight.”
He brushed her cheeks gently. Angelica’s eyes filled with tears.
“Don’t cry my dear. I’ve told you. Your services are part of something greater.”
He left and shut the door behind himself. Angelica collapsed, letting out a cry that never reached her lips. Whatever flicker of hope she'd had for her marriage, for her life—it was gone.
Kormos.
 City of dreams?
No.
City of broken things.
That’s Kormos for you. Where a woman can lose everything and still be expected to show up smiling the next day. Maybe she cried. Maybe didn’t. Either way, by the time I found her, she'd already learned not to. It’s no wonder I had to track Angelica down in a brothel to hear this story.",0,1748814954.0,noir,0,0.5,False

Ive decided to spend a couple extra days here before moving on and would like to go check out her work.  She said it was at a coffee shop.  Probably in Old Town?  Anyone have the details?

1l111x0,https://www.reddit.com/r/inlaws/comments/1l111x0/sil_has_hated_me_for_years/,SIL has hated me for years.,"I've been married for 17 years (we got married right when we turned 18). My husband's family is huge and very diverse. I have a great relationship with my FIL and MIL (I call my FIL, dad. My bio-dad is not in the picture). My husband and I work with them in the family business, I think we're hitting 15 years now? It's been a long time, but I love it! My MIL is terrific and super sweet. My dad and I have gotten really close over the years and we talk all the time. My dad and I are trying to get to the bottom of why my SIL (mid-40's, from another country, married to one of my husband's brothers) does not like me. So, I'm just going to lay it all out there, so I can get an unbiased opinion - so I can figure out what I did wrong or how to repair our relationship.

My SIL kinda popped up out of the blue, not knowing English (she's very beautiful, smart and could speak fluent English under a year), got married within 2 weeks of knowing my BIL (literally love at first sight). My in laws were very happy and supportive, they've purchased a small home for them, got them a vehicle and a job. I was very excited to meet her, and she seemed very sweet at first until she started learning English. Once when we started establishing a good line of communication, she was very ""abrupt"". Said I was too young to be married, said there was something wrong with my parenting, joked me for not having a vehicle, renting and not owning, not wearing name brand clothing, not cooking the way she would cook. I have always chalked it up to cultural differences and have never been upset with her about this. Everyone else always brushed it off, so I just figured she's not in her home country - I must be so weird to her. 

I started distancing myself when SIL and BIL would complain about how they're not #1 in my In-Law's  
eyes anymore. They would get mad and offended if a sibling was gifted anything from our In-Laws. Started causing problems and talking poorly about everyone in the family. They started interjecting themselves in my marriage, because ""we were young - we didn't know any better"". All red flags (and a lot  
more drama/incidents), so I slowly started distancing myself.

For the past few years, I’ve been slowly trying to establish a decent relationship with SIL and BIL again, but every time I see them, they’re bad mouthing everyone in the family. They seem very entitled and come off as they’re very superior to everyone (yet they live off of In-Laws $$). We’ve gotten into a couple of arguments over the years, where every time I see SIL, she would gaslight me, manipulate every comment I say and accuse me of saying things about people that she would say. SIL is usually the host of every outing (except potlucks) and we're never invited.

Our monthly potlucks (at another SIL's house) - every time I cook something, she will not eat it. She’s starting to bring her friends over to potluck and they’re now not eating anything I cook either. I would cook anything she liked, avoid all things she was refraining from, dug deep into her culture to not offend her. Everything. Nope. She just ignores me and whispers to her friends and they giggle and walk away. It’s gotten to the point where my dad and husband will eat all my food first and dramatically brag about how delicious it is.  

My dad reached out to me recently, because he noticed it’s taking a toll on me and we’re just to the  
point where we’re thinking of maybe I should just invite her out for some coffee to squash whatever beef she has with me (he also has some problems with SIL and BIL lately as well, but that's a whole different situation). I’ve been very nice to her. I’ve never disrespected her, but I will let her know if she’s wrong (accusations or lies about people) and I don’t think she likes that. My dad asked her what’s going on and she just shrugged it off and said it’s all in my head. Every time I go to potlucks, I feel like something’s wrong. I don’t even want to be friends with her, just have a civil relationship so that our kids and spend more time together.

Sorry for the super long vent, I’m just looking for an unbiased opinion/view point on how I should address her or if I should just not exhaust my energy on her.

 

\*BIL is just like her.  
  
TLDR: I’ve been trying to establish a relationship with SIL who seem to hate my guts, it’s to the point now where any friends of the family that visit are weird with me and I’m thinking about confronting her, but she’s chalked it up to my dad that it’s all in my head.",2,1748814858.0,inlaws,0,0.75,False

I’ve always been into cold brew — especially when it’s mixed with lemon, grapefruit, or anything citrusy. Super refreshing, no sugar, just sharp and clean. 

I couldn’t really find anything like that in the UK, so I decided to create my own brand. It’s called 098 — minimal design, citrus-forward flavors, and made for people who care about good coffee and good taste.

Right now I’m looking for people who might want to join me in building this — creatives, coffee lovers, designers, anyone curious.

So I matched with this guy on an app about a month ago and he's great, we have tons of stuff in common, share the same type of humour, he's my usual type and we seem to have the same relationship goals so after a week or two of messaging we went on a date. It was just a cute coffee date + walk and we actually got on great but I left the date feeling kind of confused because although I liked him and was attracted to him I didn't feel any butterflies. For me it's usually a pretty immediate thing.

Obviously sometimes 1 date simply isn't enough so I agreed to another and we went to a local festival for the day. I again had a nice time and enjoyed his company but this time I found myself noticing some icks and by the end of the day I was desperately looking forward to it being over.

I even then called/gamed with him for a couple nights because it's an interest we both share so I figured that might finally kick my mind into gear but nope. I know I need to end things because he seems to be ready to fully commit to a relationship but I just can't do it, I'd be leading him on.

I live in São Paulo, in a small apartment that swallows almost half my salary. I work remotely for an American technology company, one of those startups that promised to change the world and is now fighting to not sink with it. It's 2025, and the air feels heavy, charged with static electricity that has nothing to do with the weather.

Outside, life moves at a strange pace. Market prices rise every week, in a macabre dance that no one understands anymore. The bank's app has become Russian roulette: sometimes the salary drops, sometimes it doesn't, and the error message is always the same: “temporary instability”. Temporary for months. We get used to it, right? We cut out the coffee, then the meat, then... well, then we avoid thinking.

On the streets, the tension is palpable. The news talks about falling crime rates, but my neighbor had his car stolen last week, in broad daylight. It took three hours for the police to arrive. They said they were “attending priority incidents”. The priority, apparently, is never us. Fear became a shadow, clinging to our heels. We walk faster, avoid looking to the side, headphones on full blast, pretending not to hear the world falling apart.

My work was my refuge. Headset in my ear, code on the screen, the English of my colleagues on the video call transported me far away. But even that began to change. Meetings became shorter, more tense. The CEO, who previously talked about “synergy” and “disruption”, now only talks about “cuts” and “efficiency”. Nobody turns on the camera anymore. Just avatars and voices choked with anxiety.

I started to notice a strange buzzing noise in calls. A low, persistent, almost subliminal noise. At first, I thought it was my old phone. I changed. The buzzing continued. I asked my colleagues. Some said they didn't hear anything, others became uncomfortable and changed the subject. “It must be the network, Carlos,” I said to Sarah, my manager, with unusual haste. “A lot of people online, you know how it is.”

But it wasn't just the buzzing. Important emails disappeared. Project files corrupted without explanation. Once, during a crucial presentation, my screen went black. Only the buzzing continued, louder, pulsing in my ear. When the connection came back, the meeting was over. I received an automated email from HR talking about “performance issues”. No one responded to my attempts to explain.

News from the US arrived as distorted echoes. Extreme polarization, violent protests, shootings that barely made headlines because they were so common. My previously talkative American colleagues became monosyllabic. Short, evasive answers. One of them, Kevin, with whom I used to exchange ideas about series, stopped responding to messages. Your Slack status has turned grey. Permanent.

The tinnitus got worse. I started hearing it even outside of calls. In the silence of my apartment, he was there, in the background. A sound that seemed to come from inside the walls, or from inside my head. I went to the doctor. Exams, audiometry. Everything normal. “Stress, my dear”, said the doctor, prescribing a tranquilizer that cost a lot of money and had no effect at all.

One night the light flickered and went out. General blackout in the neighborhood. Normal, lately. I lit a candle. The silence was filled by the hum, now clearer, more defined. It wasn't just a noise. It sounded like... a voice. Distorted, electronic, repeating something unintelligible. I got close to the window. The street was pitch black, but in the building opposite, also dark, a single window was lit. The bluish light of a computer screen. And I had the clear, cold feeling that someone there was also hearing the buzzing. And he watched me.

I went back inside, locked the door, put the sofa in front. Ridiculous, I know. But fear is not rational. The buzzing seemed to laugh at my pathetic attempt at safety. I picked up the cell phone. No signal. I tried the fixed one. Mute. Just the buzzing, now coming from the device itself.

I'm writing this on my notebook's notepad, with the battery running low. The light didn't come back on. The buzzing is louder. The distorted voice seems to form words now. Something about “recalibration”, “resource optimization”, “disposing of inefficient nodes”. I don't know if it's real. I don't know if I'm going crazy. But the fear I feel is not of inflation, violence or political instability. It is this silent, invisible collapse that seems to infiltrate through the cracks in technology, through telephone lines, through our own ears, disconnecting us from the world and from each other. A collapse that does not bring down buildings, but minds. And the buzzing... it doesn't stop. I think he's waiting. Hoping that I become just another inefficient node to be discarded.

The nutritional landscape presented a mixed bag of advice and warnings on June 1st, 2025, with experts offering guidance on staying healthy amidst the summer heat and highlighting potential pitfalls in dietary choices. Several sources converged on the importance of mindful eating and hydration for overall well-being.

**Hydration and Summer Safety:**

Leading the headlines was a public health advisory from Dr. Shriram Nene, a cardiothoracic surgeon and public health advocate, who offered practical tips for navigating the summer heat. His message, widely shared on social media, underscored the serious health risks associated with dehydration, fatigue, and heatstroke during the warmer months. ""Staying cool isn't just about comfort, it's about your health,"" he emphasized.

Dr. Nene’s primary recommendation focused on adequate fluid intake, particularly before the sensation of thirst kicks in. He advised men to aim for 3.7 liters of water daily, while women should target 2.7 liters. Further, Dr. Nene cautioned against sugary drinks and alcohol, citing their potential to exacerbate dehydration. This advice resonates with broader public health campaigns emphasizing the importance of staying hydrated during periods of intense heat to prevent serious health complications.

**Caffeine, Medications, and Interactions:**

Beyond hydration, another significant area of concern was the potential for interference between common beverages and medications. A report detailed the interactions between coffee, a globally popular stimulant, and various pharmaceutical drugs. The article highlighted the potential for caffeine to reduce the effectiveness of some medications or increase the risk of side effects. Specific examples were not provided in the summary, but it drew a direct connection between coffee consumption and the efficacy of common over-the-counter and prescription drugs, thereby underscoring the importance of awareness and potential consultation with a healthcare professional. The report noted that tea, while containing caffeine, does not appear to affect individuals in the same way as coffee. This distinction suggests a possible difference in the bioavailability or concentration of caffeine in tea.

**Breakfast Choices and Digestive Health:**

Another key area of focus was the timing and composition of breakfast, a meal often considered the most important of the day. Articles warned against certain food choices that might trigger digestive discomfort and negatively impact mood.

The information highlighted that feeling uneasy after breakfast could be linked to the types of food being consumed. It advised against eating salads first thing in the morning, as the high fiber content in raw vegetables can be difficult to digest on an empty stomach. The report cautioned that this could lead to bloating, gas, and abdominal pain. This advice reflects an awareness of how the digestive system functions and how specific foods may be better suited for different times of the day to optimize digestion and nutrient absorption.

**Diabetes Risk Assessment:**

Two identical snippets also featured the Diabetes Risk Calculator, offering a straightforward tool to assess the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes within the next decade. The calculator provides a personalized assessment based on individual answers, categorizing users into low, moderate, or high-risk groups. Those categorized as low risk are encouraged to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise and a balanced diet. Those in the moderate risk group were advised to make improvements to their lifestyle. The presence of this calculator demonstrates a continued emphasis on preventative health measures and educating the public on proactively managing their health.

**Overall Health and Wellness:**

The nutrition news from June 1st, 2025, painted a picture of multifaceted advice, reinforcing core principles of preventative health. The focus was on hydration, recognizing the need for careful choices related to beverages, and the importance of appropriate food choices, especially for breakfast. The inclusion of a diabetes risk assessment tool further underlines the growing emphasis on proactive health management and personalized health information.

The news reflected an effort to empower individuals with knowledge, suggesting that simple dietary and lifestyle adjustments can have a significant impact on health and well-being. The emphasis on hydration in hot weather, the warning about coffee and medication interactions, and the advice regarding morning food choices all collectively contribute to a wider understanding of how our day-to-day choices can profoundly affect our health. The advice reinforces the idea that paying attention to these details can enhance the quality of life and reduce the likelihood of adverse health outcomes.

1l10td8,https://www.reddit.com/r/JunesJourney/comments/1l10td8/grand_unified_theory_of_green_badges/,Grand unified theory of Green badges,"Two conditions, my team prioritizes CM and I buy gems. 

My goal is to play as many three-segment sections as I can to minimize the use of green badges. You get one 11 green badge section, two 12 green badge sections, etc.  I hate paying 16 green badges a turn.

Soon as possible after CM begins, I play regular scenes until I get 300 badges. Then I collect drinks badges. My team prioritizes green badges at coffee time, and the first day of CM is usually green badge drinks for free. Our first drink time is 10 AM my time, and I try to get my regular play done by then and then give five green badge drinks. This costs me 65 coins.  It yields abt 70 green badges with propagates across my team. 

I open up CM and get the additional 200 badges. I then play my first section, after I look at the map (if possible), trying to find the best way to get to three-segment sections.  

My club is extremely good about giving backup and I usually ask for it, just to have a buffer of time. If I can find a three-segment section that yields green badges, I ask for backup and right before I finish, I go and play regular scenes until I fill up on green badges. Then I go back and play my last scene to finish that section of CM.

With this technique, I am one of the consistent producers for CM for my club. I usually get 50 segments this way. My club even finished the extreme version got last time, though the next time we get it, we probably won’t to protest.

Yesterday I went to my best friend’s sister’s graduation party which was held in another city so I needed a ride there. Their parents aren’t together anymore so they don’t live together, so I tagged along with their dad. The ride there was pleasant and we had small talk going on during the ride. 

After the party I asked him if I could get a ride back home also to which he agreed. During the ride we had the same small talk going on but then it turned a bit more personal, like about life, mental health and relationships for example. And sometime later, he abruptly he just said that he enjoys having a conversation with me and he finds me very interesting. Ending it with “Would you like to go out with me? It doesn’t have to be a date but to just hang out since I have enjoyed this time with you and I want to get to know you better”. At first I told him that yes, of course as a friend but it would be a bit weird since he is their dad. 

Then I asked him what does he really want from me, and that how does hanging out differ from a date when he suggested to go for a coffee or lunch. He then told me that he is interested in me. I told him back that I would like to go out with him if he wasn’t their dad. He asked me again if it’s because of his age and I told him no, since I don’t have any preferences in my dating pool. He is almost 60 and I am 24. 

The conversation started to get a bit weirder since he started to quote some tv-show where the main characters were in this kind of a situation and it went well for them. I started getting a bit anxious and nervous, usually when I do that I laugh a lot and start rambling. So I ended up kinda agreeing with his question, but with a condition that I would talk to my best friend first about it. I kinda thought it in a way that I could tell her what happened and we could “softly” turn him down without much of a hassle or drama. 

After he had dropped me to my house, he got up also to say goodbye but before that he asked me to give him a hug and I did. Then he took the back of my head and tried to kiss me, a bit forcefully I must admit. I turned away immediately so he landed a kiss on my cheek. I did not like that at all. He had also previously told me that I’m pretty and he has been always watching me because there is “something in me”. 

I was very shaken up when I got home, so I cried and told my best friend and she cut ties with him. I feel so ashamed, guilty and embarrassed because I feel like I led him on. I keep thinking “Did I flirt with him” or “Did I do something so it seemed like I was interested in him”. I also feel awful because I feel like I destroyed a family.",1,1748814230.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False
1l10t7i,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1l10t7i/all_gone_in_a_matter_of_hours/,All gone in a matter of hours,"Apologies if this is a long one but I feel the full story is needed. To preface I’ve been single for nearly 8 years by choice and only last summer I decided I was interested in dating again. I’m just into my 30’s and I am looking to move to the next chapter in my life. I went on a few dates, some through apps and others from people I met in person. They were all nice people but through reasons of theirs and sometimes mine we decided to part ways, all amicably too.

Then a couple of months back I matched with a girl on an app, a couple of years younger than me, intelligent, great personality, beautiful, you know the usual haha. There was only 6 days between our match and our first date, I asked her out after only 1 or 2 days talking. 

First date comes round, it goes great! We have a few drinks, get to know each other and I walked her home. She gave me a kiss good night which honestly I wasn’t expecting, I just wanted to get her home safe but it was a nice confirmation that the date went well. We go on dates 2 and 3 which again both go really well, one date we went to grab some food together and the other was more of a fun activity with a bite for lunch. Plenty more kissing and physical contact during those dates. During these 3 weeks or so we’re texting everyday, getting to know each other better and really enjoying each others company. Also between dates 2 and 3 I was nearby to her house and text to see if she was around, she had just got home and I was 1 minute around the corner from her so I dropped in on her for 5 minutes, asked how her day was etc. and left her to enjoy her evening.

At this point I start thinking maybe it’s time to have a conversation about where we both feel this is going. We both agreed we were enjoying each others company and wanted to keep moving forward in a more exclusive manner, she said she wasn’t speaking to anyone else which was the same for me. However she wanted to take things slow, she likes a “slow burn” was her words. I was fine with this because I’d been single for a while and was in no rush.

After our third date she got ill later that weekend, I dropped round a goodie bag with some comforts and medicine a couple of days after her saying she felt horrific. She said then if she felt better by the coming weekend she’d like to do something. So later that week, after texting most days as normal, I asked if she still wanted to do something, she said she still wasn’t feeling her best but invited me to come over hers and I could cook her some food and have a more relaxed evening. So for date 4 that’s what we do, I go over hers, we cook dinner together and spend the rest of the evening cuddling on the sofa and watching TV. This evening she starts being more frisky but again I’m not initiating as to respect her wants to take things slow, plus she’s still ill bless her haha. The night comes to an end which at times we were both guilty of trying to make last longer and the conversation about staying over in the future comes up.

We continue talking over the weekend and into the beginning of the next week, again everything is going as it has before, even talking about availability for date 5. Then I had a couple of really shit days, family issues, work issues etc. nothing changed between us maybe just a little less communication because I had a lot going on which I told her about just not the details. So on my way home from work I text to ask if she was busy, I just wanted to have a quick coffee or something and have a laugh with her, maybe explain what had been going on. She said she was busy (heading to the gym) which wasn’t an issue.

That’s when it happened, 2 hours later. I get the text saying she wasn’t feeling a deeper connection etc. and wanted to end things here. So I’m completely blindsided, where did this come from? We talked on the phone later that evening and I asked the obvious question, where’s this come from? She said it was a number of small things but also it felt very intense for her. I must say I really respect her for offering me to talk about what had occurred rather than ghosting. She also admitted she was scared of commitment which I said I was too but I was ready to take that risk with her. 

Anyways the conversation comes to a close and we haven’t spoken since. This was a month ago. Honestly I’m really feeling some pain from all this. I’m trying to respect myself and her by not communicating but I have so many questions that honestly I don’t think even she knows the answers to.

I don’t know if she really liked me and got scared and ran or if it just genuinely wasn’t right for her. It literally went from 100 to 0 in a matter of hours.

It’s painful. Really painful.

But I came to this sub looking for ideas to help my husband with his quitting symptoms, and reading the posts here are making me second guess myself. Could I go a day with NO caffeine?

1l10ri4,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1l10ri4/my_24hour_layover_in_casablanca_royal_air_maroc/,"✈️ My 24-Hour Layover in Casablanca (Royal Air Maroc, Montreal → Cairo) — What to Expect & Tips","Hey everyone — this is my first Reddit post, so I hope it helps someone. I just went through a 24-hour layover at Casablanca Airport (CMN) on my way from Montreal to Cairo, flying Royal Air Maroc on a single ticket. Here's a full breakdown of my experience, including lounge access, food, sleeping, and what I wish I knew earlier.


---

🔁 Why the 24-Hour Layover Happened

My first flight (Montreal → Casablanca) was delayed by 1.5 hours.
Because the second leg (Casablanca → Cairo) was tightly scheduled, I missed it and got rebooked — but the next available flight was 24 hours later.

Tip: If you're transiting through Casablanca (or similar airports), it's wise to leave more buffer time between connecting flights to account for any unexpected delays.


---

🚫 Can You Leave the Airport?

No — I was not allowed to exit the airport since I was in transit on a single ticket. I asked about leaving to book a hotel outside, but was told I had to remain airside.


---

🕌 First Night: No Lounge Space, Slept in the Mosque

When I arrived:

The free Oasis Lounge (provided by Royal Air Maroc) was full

There’s no booking — it’s first come, first serve

I ended up spending the night in the airport mosque, which was quiet and comfortable enough to rest



---

🛋️ Oasis Lounge (Free with Royal Air Maroc)

The next morning, I finally found a spot in the Oasis Lounge, located:

One floor below the gates, down the stairs in the middle of the food court


What’s inside:

Basic seating (sofas and chairs)

No showers (or at least none that I found)

Lounge-specific Wi-Fi, which worked well — unlike the airport’s free Wi-Fi, which eventually stopped working

Lounge was very crowded early, but quieted down later



---

🍴 Free Meal Vouchers

From the lounge desk, I received meal vouchers accepted at several restaurants. You can use them at any restaurant in the food court that displays the voucher sign (I used mine at Pomme de Pain which usually has pre-set meals for the vouchers, do not about other places)

Breakfast (7:00–9:00 AM): Croissant + Coffee + Water

Lunch (12:30–3:00 PM): Chicken or beef sandwich + drink

Dinner (7:00–9:00 PM): Same as lunch


You get one voucher per meal period, and each voucher is valid for one order at one restaurant — you can’t split across restaurants.


---

🏨 Airport Transit Hotel

There’s a transit hotel inside the airport, with single rooms for around €60. I didn’t stay there, but it’s worth considering if the lounge is full and you want a private space.


---

🧾 Compensation?

I haven’t asked for delay compensation yet, but since both flights were on a single ticket, I might be eligible under EU261 or similar rules. Worth checking if this happens to you.


---

🧠 Key Takeaways

You cannot leave the airport during a long layover if you’re on a single-ticket international transit

The Oasis Lounge has no reservations — first come, first serve

Ask for meal vouchers at the lounge desk (fixed menus, limited timing)

You can redeem vouchers at any restaurant showing the voucher sign

Consider booking a buffer (longer layover) if you’re flying through CMN

The mosque is a peaceful place to sleep if the lounge is full

Lounge Wi-Fi is reliable if the public one fails

One day, husband made me pour over coffee but served it with loads of milk and sugar instead of my usual black. Then left for a meeting. I was already working on a paper and was in the zone so I registered that he put a mug by me, but not what it was. Started drinking it.... Eeeew it was bitter even w the sugar. And scratchy on the throat. Meh, it was caffeine, I drank it anyway. Messaged him about it. And I got a smiley face then radio silence. 

He comes home and I ask him again about why the coffee tasted bad. He said ""I win! I win! I made u stale coffee. Found the beans in the corner of my bin. Don't know how long it's been there. There's a difference!"" And laughed his ass off to start cooking dinner.

It was a Saturday night, I was glued to my laptop screen, sipping from my coffee mug. The clock blinked
 12:49 am when I was almost convinced to leave for bed. 

All of a sudden, my almost so called ""dead phone"" lit up out of nowhere. 

‘Oh, it's Rita! Why is she calling in this dead of the night’ I felt. 
I picked the call in one ring but before I could ask anything she cut me off consequently. 

“Ashar, brother it's critically urgent, sorry for bothering you in such time” she spoke swiftly.
“What happened, is everything okay?” I replied with a tight concern. 
“No, it's not. Someone's stalking me, my whole existence. Since you're in an investigative department, I considered it will be a cakewalk for you” she said, her voice carrying hope. 
“Alright, how do you know that someone's stalking you?” I asked in an inquiring manner. “Give me all the details“ I completed without wasting any further second.
“He sent me many menacing letters and texts. Wait, let me send you all the texts and letters” she said in one go. 
A moment later, screenshots and pictures filled my inbox. The situation is really terrible. Each text is more terrifying than the last.

❝Hey dear! Seems like you are ecstatic these days. How did you forget me that easily, hmm? For you my family lost me, how could I even let you breath? I will be the cause of your destruction. Be ready and till then, carpe diem!❞

His messages are more like hiding something deep, untold. Feels like Rita really did something worse with him but what could that be? Who can this person be?
 I first asked her to ensure either she suspects anyone from her known or not. But in back, she completely denied which confirms it is someone out of her network but if so, why will anyone of her unknown try to harm her? 

A flood of memories overwhelmed my vision.

Who is that? I asked pointing my finger towards a boy in his 20's in their family picutre that was finely secured to the wall in a massive frame.
""Uhm, he is my step brother"" Rita answered who was packing her backpack for the way to collage.
I noded at her words.
""Let's go""  she completed.

""You never told me that you have a brother and that too a step one"" I taunt her when we both were walking on the empty road
""We don’t have any contact with each other neither do we have a good relation. So I think there's no need to talk nonsense about this""  by saying this she ended the conversation and I made an 'O'

The morrow, when I woke up, I discovered a text from an unknown number sent in the wee hours of the same day.

""Being friend is okay but don't create a fuss by trying to become a kin if not then I also have to think of you reluctantly""

Is he trying to threaten me? Well, I'm game, come what may but I am not going to step back. Only if he had any specific number it would be easy as ABC for me to trace him, every breath he is breathing. I didn't involve any of my associates regarding this matter since Rita pleaded me to handle the situation personally. Before I could think further, I discovered 4 missed calls from Rita. I called her back straight away and she picked up on the second ring. 

“Ashar how far have you gotten in the investigation?” she spoke right away.
“I told one of my informers to trace his IP address. Soon, I intend to figure it out. Just give me two days”. I assured her. 

I checked his numbers and I perceived that he uses one of his telephone numbers frequently for sending texts and I optimistically think this can assist so I promptly started investigate through it. 

“That's good, please be early as possible, I feel insecure"" 
“Don't sweat it, you have my back“ I try to ensure her in a comforting tone and she hummed in exchange and ended the call.

Though I didn't mention it on the call, I actually suspected Rita too but since she's experiencing a mental health challenge, it’s better not to worry her in addition. I put police security around her homestead, they all are roaming like normal people so that no one doubts. I set out all these stealthily without her concern. I didn't want anyone to know about the protection not even her. I anticipate her to be fine or else would that be better if I informed her?

Two days passed normally with no further sign of the stalker, as if he faded with the setting sun.

On the following day, a notification caught my attention. One of my informers who was investigating about the IP address and also Rita's past, gave me all the troops regarding both the intruder and Rita. Earth from my feet completely slipped away.

We stayed in Preferred Club, King Room, Junior Suite with an Ocean View- it’s definitely worth the upgrade! Preferred Club allows you full access to the entire resort and private pools and beaches. We enjoyed going to different pools and bars during our stay. 

We did not get a swim up room with a butler. There wasn’t one available and it was a lot more money. Personally, I’m glad we didn’t do it. It was so easy to book our excursions and dinners. Everyone was extremely helpful. Unless you have cash to burn, I didn’t think it was worth it. 

Our room was quite comfortable with a king bed, jetted tub in the room and a private hot tub on the balcony. There was a waterfall shower and big double sinks. Our toilet was finicky and we did have trouble with it running and not flushing well. (My hubby said it was me, but all other facilities on the property I had no trouble with). This is actually a “first world problem” and not a big deal. They provided clean linens and had turn down service if we wanted it. There was also a clothes steamer, hairdryer, umbrella (for Pop up showers, slippers and laundry service. There wasn’t a single thing that we could’ve asked for that wasn’t provided by a kind, friendly person. 
*With exception to Room Service  after 10:00pm or a cocktail on Friday evening after 10:00pm. The bar service in Preferred was closed as was the main building bar. That was disappointing. 

As for the property, it is pretty substantial in size. It is made up of 4 main buildings that as Preferred Club, you have full access to. St James Preferred, St James Main, Wild Orchid Main and Wild Orchid Preferred. Across from St James Preferred is Breathless which is geared towards a younger party crowd but still all adults. They had a DJ at night, a club atmosphere and great pools. There wasn’t an ocean view from the pool so we only went there one day. But they did have a beautiful outdoor pool area, swim up bar,  a DJ and Skye who entertained the crowd with games and her amazing dancing. 

Vacationing without any children was really nice, I have to admit. No loud kids or crying babies, that extra layer of peace was wonderful! 

Between the two “main” buildings is the shopping area and a gourmet coffee stand. You can buy almost anything and charge it to your room or pay with a credit card, no cash. It isn’t cheap but they do have 30% discount days Wednesday and Friday 2-4pm. They also have local vendors on a couple nights who bring in also sorts of cool art and local wares. There are also some carts throughout the property with other souvenirs. 

Beyond the shops are the restaurants: A Mexican restaurant (we didn’t try and nobody raved about the food), Blue Mountain which is Jamaican Food (Quite delicious, definitely worth trying!), also an Italian, French and Japanese restaurant. We went to all of them, the Japanese was the best in our opinion, make a reservation for the hibachi table it was a fun experience! We also went to the rooftop restaurant at Breathless for the sunset dinner. The view was exquisite and dinner was good. This also required a reservation. If you have a swim out room you have butler service and they will make reservations for you. If you don’t, go to World Cafe to make reservations. They will walk you through the process. 

World Cafe is the breakfast and lunch buffet. You can get almost anything you could imagine to eat here. From granola to yogurt, pancakes, fruit, omelets, carved ham, curried chicken and lox & bagels and everything in between. All kinds of juices and teas, mimosas and Bloody Marys.
There was tons of food but most of it was average, nothing stood out as amazingly delicious food except for a few things. The Steak Tartare at the French restaurant was the best thing I ate all week. 

We also took a Glass Bottom boat tour from the resort and an excursion on a Catamaran Sunset Tour. Both were great and worth every penny. 

The views, the water and the landscape were incredible! The worst part was seeing the rundown parts of town, which reminded us of how fortunate we are to have been able to enjoy this paradise. But it was heartbreaking to think so many of the wonderful people who served us likely lived there. 

Things we brought that were worth it: A packable sun hat! This was a must have! The sun was very hot! 
A blowup pool hammock. $8 on Amazon for a 2 pack, we passed them along to others when we left. This made floating in the sea and the pool super relaxing. 
Multiple swimsuits, it was very humid so they took extra long to dry. 
Insulated cups with straws! We were told to bring these and I’m so glad we did! It was no problem having them filled and they stayed cold in the hot sun. I also packed some dish soap to wash them in our room. 

Pack lighter than you think you should. We didn’t need so many clothes or fancy shoes. 

Wish we had brought: Water shoes, many people had them in the sea and I’m sure it made walking in the sand easier. 

Best things: The people! Service was Top Shelf! Specifically- Bevrica, Our Preferred Front Desk Concierge. She was classy and kind, so incredibly helpful and gave first class service. Her personalized service made our stay unforgettable. Billy Love, the best Golf Cart Driver and best dressed man on the island! He is a true gentleman! Kevin, Chase, Nicole (Waitress at the French Restaurant) and many others were also wonderful! 
Club Mobay at the airport! They will meet you upon arrival, escort you through the airport and back. You will get food and drinks and first class service. It is a separate service but for $150-ish, round trip it was absolutely worth its weight in gold! 

The not-so-great truths: They advertise 24 hour access to food and top shelf liquor. That is not 100% accurate. Best vodka at 90% of the resort was Tito’s. The piano bar had Belvedere but you couldn’t get it at any of the restaurants. Best bourbon at the resort was Jim Beam. Most bars had well liquor and frozen mixes. The “bar” at the preferred club was a counter with a worker making drinks. 
The food left much to be desired. It was plentiful but it was not gourmet.  I’m sure it was better before Hyatt bought them. I’d rather pay less for our stay and pay for meals separately for upscale food and liquor. 
Also many places shut down early and we had a hard time finding places to have cocktails and entertainment after 9:00 pm. We just wanted to extend each day to make the most of our trip but it felt like they encouraged the “old people” to go back to their rooms. 

If you want to hear music in your room (or on your headphones), Pandora is not supported in Jamaica but Amazon Music is, or you need to download tunes to your device. Also, if you want to watch TV, streaming tv and movies were not user-friendly. We weren’t here to watch tv but we just wanted to watch something when going to bed. We didn’t have much success with that. 

Overall it was a wonderful experience. We didn’t go for the Zip-lining or Falls, nor did we want to take a 90 minute bus ride to excursions, just not our thing. People we spoke to enjoyed them. We were more interested in relaxing and enjoying the sunshine. The end of May must not be “in-season”, so it wasn’t crowded. Many days we had the pool to ourselves, not a complaint, just an observation. It was quiet and simply beautiful and not dealing with lots of people was a joy. 

We would like to go back. 9 out of 10 for us! ",3,1748813458.0,AllInclusiveResorts,1,0.71,False

Let me hold my chest while I survive this dense syrup induced heart attack.

I don’t know what’s going on with coffee here, but it feels like the bar for “good” has been dragged into the ocean.

Half the time, the coffee burnt beyond recognition. You order a flat white or cappuccino and get something that tastes like it was brewed with soil. Bitter, acidic, borderline undrinkable.

Then comes the other extreme, the flavour syrup obsession. You try to soften the blow of the burnt taste with a little caramel or vanilla and suddenly you’re sipping what feels to be a diabetes starter pack. It’s like they pump 20 tablespoons of syrup in and called it a “caramel coffee.” It’s not coffee anymore it’s a liquid heart attack.

Every time I think I’ve found a decent spot, the barista quits and the coffee quality went with them.  

Rant over. But seriously, if anyone knows a place around the Coast that serves a smooth, strong, non-burnt, non-syrup-laced brew, I’m all ears. 

Macca 👎 GYG 👎 Banjos 👎 plus a few smaller cafes which I won’t name as I know they just trying to make a living 👎

✨ Shout out to the Nines Café in Maroochydore Homemaker Centre always a brilliant coffee. 

✨ Also Skål café in Peregian damn great coffees. 

Both unfortunately out of my way when I’m heading to work.

I describe it like a mental dullness. I can't perceive the world clearly, like I have something covering around my head and my eyes. And a bit of buzzing in and around my eyes and ears. I really can't get motivated/happy/excited or feel connected to the world that much. The motivation and positive emotion *is* there but it doesn't really register in my body, mind or emotions that well. I feel like if I could *only* sleep I'd be ready to do things and enjoy things. Any cognitive activity and sensory input is too much for me. Everything I do feels tedious. Half of me doesn't want to socialize even though I still do it. I am less inclined to approach people and take iniative for anything. It takes more effort to learn, to listen to people's stories, to think abstractly, and to access my memories, opinions, vocabulary, etc. I'm surviving but don't have any inspiration.

Worse sleepiness seems to follow mental and even physical activity. I need multiple breaks a day. If not, it feels like the sensory stimuli, my thoughts, and physical activity are piling up until I'm mentally and physically fatigued, can't continue thinking, can't hold a conversation, and can't continue my day.

The best thing for me is falling asleep. But usually I can't, so at least laying down quietly in the dark with my eyes closed helps temporarily.

Even when I seem to be running on ""tired but wired"" physical energy I still can't think too clearly.

The rare times I DON'T feel this way is when I've had coffee or matcha. But they stop working really quickly.

I was wondering about your experiences with this, if you've found the cause, or if anything has helped you. Any tips or info is much appreciated.",1,1748813426.0,cfs,1,1.0,False

So, I reached out to my ex, we talked some over 3 or so days until I eventually ask her if she'd want to get coffee sometime. She then tells me that she's seeing someone so it wouldn't be a good idea.

I don't know why but it just hurts so much, I thought I had moved on from her but talking to her and and then learning that she had moved just killed me. Some part of me desperately wanted to believe that she missed me and wanted me back and why would she still be talking to me if she were in a relationship? I mean afterall she was responding very quickly to my messages. But it was all just a cope. She moved on I hadn't. She's with someone else, she's giving them all the affection that used to be reserved for me doing all the things we used to do. It's just driving me crazy and I don't know why. Why am I mourning our relationship like we broke up yesterday and not 2 years ago?

The worst part of it all is that I still want to believe that she cares about me deep down which just her being with someone else all the worse. I mean why would she humor my texts if she didn't? But there's nothing I can do about it, I just have to sit here and stew in my sadness knowing this hasn't effected her nearly as much this time.

I still don't regret reaching out to her though, at this point I think it's evident that I have unresolved feelings for her ",1,1748813393.0,heartbreak,0,1.0,False

You aren't broken.  BUT you need change. You'll feel SO MUCH BETTER if you start.

So, there are 30 weeks left before New Years. I bet you money we can change your world. It's going to suck. But let's do this, ok? Starting this week, you will work your way down this list. I'd like you to focus on the first 5 things in-order and then the rest of the list can be mixed up.

I'm not saying it'll be easy. But for real - the woman you are on January 1 2026 could be completely different if you actually implement this.

1) This week. Look up your health insurance plan and see if it covers therapy. If it does not, get on [BetterHelp.com](http://BetterHelp.com) and find a therapist. THIS WEEK find a therapist. Ideally someone who knows about ASD but any therapist is better than no therapist. Schedule your first apt.

2) Next week, tell your BF you want to learn to cook and grocery shop. Ask him if you can Cook and shop with him the entire month of June. When he goes to the store, you want him to take you and pretend like he's a grocery store professor (a little role-play never hurt anyone ;) ). He needs to teach you the layout of the store. How he bags groceries. How he figures out what groceries to buy and where does he make the list.

3) Week 3: Self-care gets re-introduced. You start getting out of pajamas and putting on real clothes. Or at least cute, intentional, lounge-sets. You wash your hair regularly and start doing skin care routines. Take medicine if you have any. Make a checklist if you need to.

4) Week 4: Come up with a cleaning chore-chart for you and boyfriend. What chores will you do? What will he do? (If you guys agree that it's your job to clean the bathroom but you don't know how - ask him to teach you. Or youtube it. There's no need to ""guess"" when there are so many ways to learn!"" Come up with a chore-chart and then start doing your chores (common chores are laundry, washing the sheets, cleaning the kitchen, cleaning out the fridge, vacuuming, cleaning the bathroom, car washes / cleaning out the car, taking out the trash / recycling, double checking your medicine cabinet / pantry to see what needs to be restocked.

5) Week 5: start a journal. Write daily. 5 mins - even if it's just a summary of the grown-ass things you did that day like take your medicine and going grocery shopping.

On Week 6: sit down with your boyfriend, talk about what the last 5 weeks have looked like, and then talk about the remaining 25 weeks. Don't do this sitting on the couch. Go to a coffee shop. With a notebook. Make it like a business-summit if needed. This needs to be an intentional, focused topic. You want HIM to see you're trying. And your ASD will internalize it better if it feels more formal than just a willy-nilly conversation you have over eating cheerios at your table.

Week 7-30:

7) learn to either finish everything on your plate or how to push food around to make it look like not much is left. Work with your therapist to figure this out.  
8) Pick out a budgeting book (Financial Feminist or Rich AF are two good ones) and start reading and learning personal finance  
9) Schedule your annual physical and eye exam  
10) Youtube how to change a tire - get AAA if you don't currently have it  
11) Learn to cook a new recipe and pick out 10 new ones to cook over the next couple months.  
12) Sign up for a gym or start exercising in a way that is FUN for you. (Rock climbing! Swimming! Zumba! Weight lifting! Boxing!)  
13) Do you live in an emergency zone (earthquakes, tornados, hurricanes)? Create your emergency-kit.  
14) Plan another check-in summit with your boyfriend. Time to check in and see how our new goals and habits are doing!  
15) Learn to do something handy! Change a light-switch that is too loud, install a dimmer light switch, change a faucet, steam clean your carpets - something handy!  
16) Learn to parallel park well.  
17) Plan, cook, and host a dinner party with an appetizer, dinner, drinks, and music. Thank your friends for being patient with you and tell them over the last few months you've been upleveling and you have another 13 weeks to go of uplevel-life! Make it a formal affair. And then do it! Plan the menu, grocery shop, cook - do it alllll. The sense of accomplishment you will feel will be outstanding!  
18) Learn to remove stains - buy a couple shirts from good will, stain them with wine, cooking oil, candle wax, and ballpoint pen - learn to get out stains and what does and doesn't work on different fabrics.  
19) Learn to sew on a button and how to ""tack-hem"" pants (like shoot, your new pants are so cute but too long and you want to wear them TONIGHT!) Learn how to tack your pants to make them shorter until you can get to a tailor.  
20) Create a ""life binder"" - a binder with your health insurance info, your accounts with different banks, etc. Basically everything you have an open account with? You need info written down so if you pass away unexpectedly, your family knows what accounts to close on your behalf.  
21) Check out your credit score and see what you can do to improve it. Open a HYSA.  
22) Christmas is coming - learn to wrap a present well. Start shopping now so you 1) get good deals and 2) can get personalized, intentional gifts. Your mom doesn't need another coffee mug for christmas - maybe a manicure or a necklace with your grandma's name in it would be better? Plan ahead!  
23) It's almost Thanksgiving! Start buying chickens to practice because babe - you are helping - if not HOSTING, friendsgiving! Start researching Thanksgiving menus and practicing recipes. Did someone say scalloped potatoes?? ♥  
24) Learn to open a bottle of champagne and learn what does white wine go with, red wine, and champagne. Also learn how to make an old fashioned and a martini.  
25) First-Aid week! Learn basic first aid. Better yet, sign up for a first aid class from Red Cross or through your local parks and rec in your town!  
26) Time for your second-to-last check in with boyfriend! How are we doing? How are habits? Chores? What should be in the final push between now and New Years?  
26) Learn to build a fire in a firepit or fireplace.  
27) Substitute (Come up with one with your man you want to replace or add!)  
28) Substitute  
29) Substitute  
30) Final summit with your BF. (also, buy a new journal for the upcoming self-summit and new year)  
30.5) Have a summit with yourself. For real. Hotel room, overnight, by yourself. Go to dinner by yourself, order dessert, go back to your room. Take a bubble bath. Then - That journal you've been keeping all year? Re-read it. Write your final entry as a reflection on the year. Then get out your new journal and at the beginning write the things that are top priorities for the new year. Not resolutions - just new adventures.

  
I know this is long. And if you read it to the end, Wahoo! All this to say, you can learn. I get that you weren't taught these things growing up. But honestly? Most of us aren't. We have to LEARN how to gracefully lose at board games. We have to LEARN that if it's too cold in a room, we just always make sure to bring a jacket and we don't make a fuss. We have to LEARN the world does *not* revolve around us. We have to LEARN skills.

You can do this. The question is how badly do you want it?

It rained a lot and I was there during Carnival. Below is my review!

Main Takeaways:

* Renting a car here is ideal.
* Bring a raincoat and shoes with good traction that can get wet.
* Check out Fanal Forrest, Pico de Aireo and Nun’s Valley.
* GO CANYONING!!!

TOURIST ACTIVITIES:

**Cabo Girão Skywalk** \- Not worth it, IMO. I love a good tourist attraction, but this was not cheap and it was no more than 10 minutes of entertainment. This entire island has beautiful, elevated views that often have no people. This is definitely meant for elderly people on cruise ships to get a safe, nice view of the island. Do not waste your time here. INSTEAD, go to the status of Cristo Rei to get the same view for free and with less people. The statue is the least magnificent part of this view, and there’s a mini hike out towards the sea. There’s free parking here, too. 

**Monte Palace Tropical Garden** \- I didn’t get a chance to go, but I wish I did. I saw it, briefly, as I rode the cable cars, but I didn’t have time to go in. 

**Cable Cars** \- Super expensive and you definitely need to buy your ticket in advance. I got here around 10am on a Tuesday in the off season and waited in line for 30 minutes. It’s crazy busy and right outside the cruise ship terminal. The address for the cable cars is weird. My driver dropped me off at the “Cable Car” destination that Maps had pulled up and it was a random car dealership. Make sure you’re got the right address - there are multiple cable cars and cable car stops throughout the island. Also, Madeira Friends does free workouts at the park right next to the entrance as well. 

**Santana traditional houses** (Casas Típicas de Santana) - Go to this museum, but don’t pay to enter unless you are deeply curious about the history. There are signs describing info about them, and you don’t get much more when you pay. I visited here on my way back to my hotel after hiking the Small trail of the Levada do Rei. There was a coffee shop nearby that I grabbed a cappuccino and a pastry from before driving back. *If you have limited time on the island, skip this.*

**Porto Moniz Swimming Hole -** Worth it even if you don’t want to swim. The pools were closed for inclement weather, which was actually so cool because I saw huge waves break on this gorgeous black rock structure. This swimming hole is a naturally made pool from lava/rock formations. There’s a little town that you can walk around to get more views of the pools. I ate the black scabbard and banana meal at Restaurante Polo Norte here. I sat solo and felt totally comfortable. It was a great place to eat, watch the waves and take shelter from a massive rainstorm happening when I was there.

**Sexial Beach -** Gorgeous black sand beach that you can swim at. There’s also a swimming hole across from it that I saw people with goggles doing laps in. The restaurant across from the beach (Lounge Bar Club - Naval do Sexial) had great food and great service. Expect to park far. This is a great place to take beginner surfing lessons, also!

**Ponta do Sol** \- A historic port town, this is mainly for sightseeing. The Old Pharmacy was a cute, good restaurant. The bar next to it had amazing homemade poncha. The drug store next to that had the cheapest cappuccino I could find in walking distance. Also, there is a gas station with a grocery store about .5 mile away (although it’s all uphill). There’s also a cheap nail and hair salon about a 15 minute walk away from Ponta beach, right past the gas station/grocery store aforementioned. 

**Funchal** \- The biggest city in Madeira, Funchal is the center for nightlife and housing. Some people I met said they would stay in Funchal if they came back to Madeira for another long-term stay. I went to Rei Da Poncha after Carnival and had a great time. I walked around Funchal afterwards with some people from my hotel and got a banana beer later on. It was fun to go around at night. I think a walking tour would have been cool to learn more history about Funchal. 

HIKES 

The main reason people come to Madeira is for the nature, and often the hikes. There are a million places to hike here, and the coast to coast hikes seemed amazing, but alas I was here to work so I only did some weekend and early morning hikes.

 My #1 tip is to go early! There is not a lot of parking and if you don’t come early enough, you just won’t get a spot. At 6:30am, there were people on these trails. Outside of parking, the road with levadas are typically narrow and you’ll have to wait awhile for big groups to pass. It makes the hike so much less enjoyable. 

* My friend fell in one of the levadas! Bring an extra pair of socks and wear waterproof hiking boots. It’s very slippery to so ensure your shoes have good grip. I have a pair of mammoth books and they were great.

**Pico de Aireo** \- don’t need a guide but nice to have one for driving up the windy roads in the dark. Bring a blanket, hat, gloves(so needed!!), puff jacket, windbreaker/raincoat, base layers - very windy and cold. Bring a flashlight. I wore leggings and a pair of hiking pants and I wasn’t warm but I was fine. I would recommend going with a group because it was an amazing experience to share and to get there 2 hours before the sunrise - the spots up high fill up, and it's worth it to get an unobstructed view.

* I did this tour and it was great. I would recommend doing breakfast included. Our tour guide also took us to the view from Cristo Rei: [https://www.viator.com/tours/Funchal/Sunrise-Tour-at-Pico-do-Arieiro-with-coffee-tea-and-breakfast-included/d22388-340292P4?medium=social-share-copy](https://www.viator.com/tours/Funchal/Sunrise-Tour-at-Pico-do-Arieiro-with-coffee-tea-and-breakfast-included/d22388-340292P4?medium=social-share-copy)

**Fanal Forrest** \- I did a mix of three hikes here, as I got a bit lost. You don’t need a guide to do any hikes, this was just my first day on the island and I chose to explore rather than follow alltrails. Fanal is amazing and it’s a must-see if you’re in Madeira. There’s tons of parking and you can get here by bus. The trails aren’t that thin so you won’t have problems with people. The coolest thing about fanal is that you can watch clouds roll over the mountain next to you, and you can even find yourself walking through a cloud! 

FANAL HIKES: Fanal - PR13 Vereda Fanal - Fio Viewpoint, Rota dos Fios & Pedreira via PR13 Vereda do Fanal and Fios

Check weather for fanal here: [https://www.windfinder.com/forecast/fanal](https://www.windfinder.com/forecast/fanal)

**Valley of the Nuns:** I did my favorite hike here. It was solid uphill - all stairs for about 2 miles. It rained during my hike, which was scarier on the way down, so you \*need\* good shoes as it’s basically a guarantee that you’ll slip at some point. There are no guardrails and I would not recommend bringing children, as it was a steep, slippery hike. Why you should do it:  I saw 5 rainbows and you’re in the middle of these huge, lush mountains. There were no words to describe the jaw-dropping beauty here.

\- HIKE: **Curral Das Freiras - Eira do Serrado Viewpoint** \- (3-4 miles) it says part of the trail is closed but it didn’t effect anything. It starts off the side of a highway and you have to park about a half mile down. Insane views and a great adventure are what I would recommend this hike for.

PR 6.2 **Lagoa do Vento Trail - Alecrim Levada** \- (4 miles) AMAZING! I did this alone before work one morning. LOVED it! There’s a waterfall, plenty of places to make the route longer, and adventurous hikes through mini forests as well as overlooking giant mountains. I saw cows in fields of yellow flowers on my way here. I loved this hike so much. I did the route the opposite way, which I enjoyed, but would only recommend to do so if you get there early. By 10am, there was a good amount of people I had to wait to pass because the trails by the levadas were so thin.

**Small trail of the Levada do Rei** (3 miles) - This trail was near the Santana traditional houses, which I wanted to check out - so I did both before work one day. I loved this trail and you definitely could extend it to make it longer. This trail got quite busy, so I’m glad I went early. It’s not that intense and has beautiful scenery, high up in the mountains with an ocean view at certain points. The trail gets very narrow, which was part of the thrill, but also all the more reason to go early and avoid the crowds. The trail is very slippery as well. Also, you have to pay for parking, but it’s cheap.

**Cascata dos Anjos** (Angels Waterfall) - This is a 15 min walk from Outsite in Ponta do Sol and you do have to walk through a tunnel and along a road with cars for part of it. But, I always felt pretty safe. It’s a huge waterfall. 

FOOD:

In general, it’s a very seafood heavy island. Bananas are the prime fruit, as well. You can tour a rum factory, too. Foodies will know better than me for the best fish to get there, but here is what I ate and enjoyed. 

**Tours** \- The main food-related tours are banana farms, rum distillery and wineries. 

**Wine** \- Madeira is known for having strong, alcoholic wine. The classic Madeira wines are above 20% ABV and while I did not like them, perhaps you have a different palette and will enjoy!

**Poncha** \- don’t take it like a shot! It’s meant to be sipped on. “Fisherman’s poncha” is the classic flavor. Tangerine and passionfruit are other common flavors. Most bars make poncha fresh, using a wooden “poncha stick” - you definitely want poncha made fresh over anything else. 

**Black Scabbard and Banana** \- Black scabbard is a creepy looking, smaller fish. I would describe it as saltier swordfish for the flavor, but that’s just my personal opinion. I ate this dish served with banana flavoring and it was one of the best things I’ve ever eaten. It sounds gross, but the flavours work so well. 

**Bolo do Caco** (Traditional Madeiran bread) - in my opinion, the garlic version is way better! It’s so cheap, literally like 2 euros for a whole order. When I flew back, I brought some to my mom - it was her favorite souvenir! I ate this with octopus - an amazing lunch. 

STAY

I stayed at **Outsite Madeira** and it was the best stay I’ve had anywhere. You get an ocean view directly across from beach access, a bar and various restaurants behind you, and the big seller is the community of this hotel. It’s technically a coworking/coliving stay, but it’s essentially a boujee hostel for adults who work remote jobs. You could spend all your time alone, but it was so easy to make friends here. Everyone goes out of their way to introduce themselves and people are constantly making plans in the groupchat. In the three weeks I was there, I don’t think I ever went a day without having a nice conversation or doing an activity with someone. I would have paid double to stay here given the social aspect. 

REMOTE WORK: 

Madeira is a hotspot, and a haven for digital nomads. The island is actually pushing to get more digital nomads and remote workers there, so they are focused on building community for remote work and digital nomads will feel welcomed and wanted there. 

Between Europenaners buying vacation homes and digital nomads claiming residency, the housing situation for locals in Madeira is brutal. Most people I met from Madeira were living in their family home and struggled to find an affordable housing situation otherwise. 

**Madeira friends** \- has workouts, networking & nightlife. This is a very friendly instagram page that you can join a whatsapp groupchat for. In the chat, they talk about activities and coworking events. I’d highly recommend the Ponta do Sol free workouts.

**Purple Fridays** \- so fun! Get your ticket in advance as they do “sell out” of tickets. They release the tickets a week in advance. They also do yoga for $10 on Thursdays (I believe, I took the class I just don’t quite remember which day) at this hotel.

ACTIVITIES:

**Canyoning** \- A combination of hiking and jumping down waterfalls - I had never heard of this sport before coming to Madeira. I would almost say to skip out on hikes to make room for this in your schedule - it was that awesome. You can give a bag to the tour guide who can protect your phone, keys, wallet and clothes, as you will be in a wetsuit with a helmet and have nothing else. I would bring a snack and a water bottle for when you’re done. You could bring a dry bag and hike with that, but you really don’t need anything. 

* I did beginner canyoning here, but if you are fearless and athletic you’d be fine to jump into intermediate: [https://epicmadeira.com/](https://epicmadeira.com/)

**Surfing** \- You get a discount if you book as a couple. They change your surf spot depending on the waves, which I appreciated. It was essentially a beginner surf lesson, but you had some freedom and they were helpful for intermediate coaching.

CAR

In order to fully experience Madeira, you need to get a car. I drive in the suburbs and sometimes in the city, and I felt fine (although extremely alert) driving in Madeira. I had one for half the time, and had a much better time when I had access to a car. Buses don’t take you everywhere and Bolts (a service like Uber) can be expensive. 

* Driving is scary - definitely no texting and driving - and the roundabouts are so easy to get confused by when you’re first getting accustomed to the driving. 
* A lot of times, the roads are 2-way roads with only enough space for 1 car. You’ll find yourself reversing a lot to make space for another car inbound or vice versa. Drive cautiously.
* If you can drive stick you’re going to get a way better deal
* If you’re going in off season, it will be cheaper to wait until you get to the island and ask other guests/nomads/locals their car rental recommendation. 
* There’s two types of gas: ""Gasóleo"" & “""Gasolina” - this was so stressful and confusing. The ‘normal/regular’ gas is Gasolina. The other one is diesel. 

Driving itself is an excursion in Madeira. Going through the mountains, towns and tunnels on a well-paved highway is truly fun. After your first few drives, you find yourself white-knuckling less and just enjoying the scenery.

PACKING LIST:

I used a neck pillow that could store clothes which was a game changer. Only brought a carry on, but ended up buying a zipped bag to check to take souvenirs home. I wish I brought some nicer clothes like a long skirt - I didn’t want to check a bag but I felt so American dressed in athletic clothes constantly. 

* **Bottoms:** 1 skort, 1 pair of lululemon leggings, 1 pair of linen pants, 3 pairs of hiking pants, 1 pair of spandex & 1 pair of athletic shorts.
* **Tops:** 1 tanktop, 1 tank crop top, 1 tshirt crop top, 2 athletic t shirts, 2 hiking tech long sleeve shirts, 1 sweater, 1 sweatshirt, 1 raincoast, 1 puff jacket and 1 long sleeve lululemon swiftly top.
* **Shoes:** tevas, running sneakers & hiking boots
* **Accessories:** headband, baseball hat, neck gaiter, beanie, gloves, workout bands, flashlight, Handkerchief, umbrella, drybag, watch, sharpie, belt bag, hand sanitizer, sunscreen, sunglasses, wet wipes, waterproof phone bag, small locks & microfiber towel
* **Toiletry bag:** Hairbrush, Chapstick, Comb, Deodorant, Floss, Soap - Lava Soap (this stuff is AMAZING for detergent), Ponytail Holders, Q-tips, Razor, Toothbrush, Toothbrush container, Toothpaste, Tweezers 
* **Medications:** 1st Aid Kit (from Amazon), Acetazolamide 125 mg (""Altitude sickness"") (didn’t need but glad i had), Zyertec/allergy meds, Dayquil, Immodium (Antidiarrheal), Benadryl, Antibiotic (z-pack +/or Levofloxacin), Bonine (motion sickness), Cough drops, Tylenol or Advil, Sore throat meds

OTHER:

I got bit by a wild dog before I came to Madeira and had to get my follow up rabies shot. Thank GOD I stayed at Outsite because the hotel manager drove me personally to the hospital and navigated the healthcare system for me. The affair took two days and hours of time - I had to take sick time from work, it took so much effort. She had to call the hospital to ensure they had the correct rabies shot. They also asked me the name of the shot, medically speaking, which I obviously had no idea of. It ultimately was free, but they took my healthcare and passport info and I had to fill out so much paperwork and talk to at least 5 different doctors. It was a huge hassle. Rabies isn’t an issue in Madeira - but be warned, the medical system is not easy!

Final Thoughts:

I wish I had time to do a boat ride, scuba diving and a Pico Ruivo hike. I wasn’t there during whale-watching season and Pico Ruivo hikes were mostly closed due to bad weather. Hiking alone was fun, but I loved balancing that with doing group tours. 

Overall, I loved spending 3 weeks in Madeira, even in the winter, and I hope this list helps!",0,1748813202.0,Madeira,3,0.5,False

1l10clt,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1l10clt/dog_payroll/,Dog Payroll,"This is the first chapter of a novel l'm working on. It's set in the same universe as an earlier posted story titled ""Cuttlefish"" which should be listed at the end of this post, though reading it isn't necessary to enjoy those one. 

THE SNIPER'S BULLET wanged off my helmet and knocked me on my ass. My company leader grabbed me by my jersey and pulled me up against the wall. Calling it a wall is an insult to walls. It was some debris we'd piled up in front of the shallow trenches we'd dug when we made contact.

My head was all pain. There's a thing they taught us about in training, Coup counter coup. It's where your brain bounces off both sides of your skull from an impact. It can kill you, but this time it just really messed me up. I wasn't there for a while.

She started checking me out, touching me everywhere and tugging at my blouse, trying to detect new blood among the old, her face all concern. I kind of freaked out myself, dazed from the impact, her urgency convincing me I was about to die.

""Am I ok? Am I hit??"" I was feeling myself all over too, my hands contesting with hers in the search for wounds.

I looked at her face, something was wrong. She was concerned but that wasn't it. Something about her posture. I wanted to tell her something.

Kayla turned my head around and kept inspecting me. Eventually she determined that I hadn't been injured and sat back. ""You're fine, Liz. And lucky.”

The shoulder of her blouse puffed up a bit and things became a bit more surreal. I sort of realized what was wrong with her posture, not certain but thinking she was too high. I wrapped my arms around her and pulled her down to me on the ground. Two more supersonic bullets crackled through the space where her head and shoulders had been.

She put a hand on my cheek and bent down. ""You're fine, Liz. And lucky …"" She gave my face a little slap. ""If you get yourself killed I'm going to be really pissed off."" She gave me a quick little kiss, that had more feeling in it than you'd think possible for how long it lasted. Kayla is my best friend. We love each other, as much as that's possible in our circumstances.


I was wearing 21st century gear owned by an ancestor who'd fought in a desert ages ago. It was too big but pretty good against projectiles, though basically worthless against energy weapons. That's the luck she was talking about. There are other girls in the company with no armor at all, or crap from the 20th century which basically only slows down shrapnel and is transparent to bullets.


Kahla raised her voice so the rest of the squad could hear her. ""If you see a target, take it."" It's our normal policy to avoid combat if possible, our numbers being few and hard to replace, but if we're attacked we fight back. We always try to bring people in, but if they shoot first, it's on them.


I heard sporadic fire begin and smelled cordite. I tried to get up, but she kept a knee on my midsection and I couldn't leave the ground. ""Gretchen, send a patrol."" Gretchen was the alpha. She looked like a German Shepherd though with Dogs, who knows. I heard her rush off.


I'm pretty sure we got an few of them. They killed two of us though, including Marie, one of my favorite dogs.


THE NEXT DAY I got a promotion of sorts. A sniper, maybe the same one that hit me, shot Kayla through her left eye. I became squad leader, for now.


I'm writing this because I'll die soon, and maybe my experience will help someone last longer. I've lasted longer than most. I'll be 16 next month.


THAT EVENING I opened a ration pack. The crinkly sound brought Gretchen over. She sat in front of me and looked at me with hungry eyes, drooling a bit. She's too polite to beg, but her not begging is really more effective than actually doing so. She's smart enough to know that. She always makes me laugh, though I didn't laugh this time.


We shared the rations and afterward she lay next to me. She put her head in my lap and sort of groaned.


""I miss her too, baby."" Gretchen rolled her head and looked up at me with mournful eyes. I scratched her behind an ear and said, ""Good girl."" Her tail thumped once.


Gretchen is very smart. She used to belong to Kayla. I figured she was mine now, but I had to ask her. ""Do you want to be my Dog, Gretchen? I already love you.""

She said, ""Love you too.""

WE ARE, ALL of us who can read, expected to keep journals, which is the real reason I'm writing this. So much knowledge has already been lost, and we're too poor to support a historian class to record what's happening now. We each must tell our stories for those that come later.

We do have a soldier class, which is me and mine, and a scientist class, which is all men. Supposedly women make better fighters and men better thinkers, though I'm not so sure about that. I've met some smart girls and some tough men. If I somehow live long enough I might join the mother class, or the military trainer class. Unlike the Invaders we aren't able to manipulate genetics directly so our jobs are chosen by natural selection.

I was raised to be an officer, so I was taught to read. I've read histories from before the Invasion, and I found them frustrating. So many assumptions and terms I didn't understand. What are the implications of owning a car? Are they hard to park and is that why they have lots? What makes a smartphone smart? What is an internet and why did people hate Facebook, when everybody was using it?


I HAD A night of bad dreams. Lilly rescued me by entering my tent quietly, but loudly enough to wake me. I knew her sounds and steps, so I woke up without shooting her. The sun was beginning to come up. Not quite dawn.


""Something wicked this way comes,"" she said quietly.


When Lilly talks, you need to translate. I thought for a minute. ""Ah, shit. Karen already?.""


Gretchen growled quietly. She didn't like Karen and she knew as well as I did why Karen was here.

We have a custom where any change of leadership could be challenged. It wasn't  approved, and in fact was prohibited. That didn't matter in the field. Our ways are our ways.

“Ok. Let her in.”

Karen was a giant. Almost 6', and muscles all over. She was raised on a cattle ranch that the Invaders didn't notice until she was almost grown. The protein rich diet and hard work made her big and strong. I don't have an explanation for why she was such a bitch.


She entered my tent, standing bent over because of her height. I said, ""Sit down. Make yourself comfortable.""


""I won't be here that long. I challenge you ""


I looked at Lilly. ""Think you could rustle up a cup of coffee for me?""


""As you wish.""  She left the tent.


""I need coffee before I can think. Sure you don't want to get comfortable?"" I was hoping she wouldn't. Standing bent over like that might make her back hurt, and I needed every advantage for what was coming.


""I'm fine. Let's do the challenge.""


""You're going to have to wait until I've had my coffee."" 


Karen exhaled impatiently. ""That's fine. Coffee won't help you, you know ""


""Why do you want to do this? Do you think you're a leader?""


""Better than you.""


""We have to relocate the company soon. We can't get pinned down here.""


""The challenge won't take long. Let's go.""


""We're going to miss you. You're a good soldier.""


She laughed.""I won't be missed. You're the one who's gonna be gone, and we won't miss you at all.""


I didn't respond to that. I clicked my tongue and Gretchen came over, never taking her eyes off Karen. She sat in front of me, her hair standing up all along her back. 


I scratched her head, and said, ""You can't come to the challenge, sweetheart. If somehow Karen wins, you can take your revenge after I'm gone.""


Gretchen made a quiet ""woof"" sound. Karen looked discomfited. As big and tough as Karen is, Gretchen is a danger. She's big and strong too, and can track anyone by their smell. She can move silently through the dark, and she has steel teeth. She is in charge of our entire K9 force. She's killed many of our enemies and you underestimate her at your own risk. 


Gretchen is a good Dog and I don't think she'd kill Karen, but none of the Dogs or dogs like Karen so she doesn't know them well. When dogs don't like you, it shows, and it can make you nervous around them. I wanted Karen to be nervous and uncertain. Anything for an edge.


I relaxed back and closed my eyes. ""Wake me up when the coffee comes."" After a while I made snoring sounds.


A bit later Lilly opened the tent flap. ""The best part of waking up is folgers in your cup."" What are folgers? Maybe they're some kind of coffee, because I could smell that.


I sat up slowly and stretched. ""All right. Let's get going.""


Karen, who had been fuming, straightened up and bumped into the tent roof. Totally painless, just embarrassing, if anyone notices.


""Watch your head."" 


I walked past her to the entrance where Lilly was holding my coffee.


""What have you got there, Lilly? Coffee? I don't want that. "" I walked through the tent flaps while she turned her head and made that little smile she does sometimes. 


""Are you coming, Karen? I haven't got all day."" I waited a second and added, ""Watch your head.""


I waited for Karen to exit and glanced at her face. It was red and really pissed off. Which I thought I wanted, but that pretty much backfired.


MY WHOLE PLAN revolved around a particular weapon. A year ago Kayla and I were scavenging in a New Orleans suburb called River Ridge. We were searching a house Kayla called a ""McMansion."" 

I was checking out the kitchen and Kayla was upstairs, checking bedrooms and closets.. You might think canned goods would keep, but they usually only last 10 years or so. Cans are rarely of any use to us. Sugar, flour, rice are useful if they haven't gotten wet, so that's what I was looking for. Vitamins, painkillers were sometimes still good. Honey is a rare treat. It will be crystalized but turns back wet with heat.

Kayla made a quiet whistle that meant ""come here.""

I stood and started moving to the stairs, as fast as possible while being quiet. Kayla's whistle hadn't included a danger tone, but maybe someone who knew the code was threatening her, and they would hear the danger tone  We have good unit cohesion, but shit does happen.

When I got far enough up the stairs I peeked over the landing to the next floor. A bedroom door was open and Kayla was looking at me. 

""Come see what I found!' She had a huge grin on her face. It's something I always found irresistible. Kayla was so beautiful.

She'd found a rack of swords. She was holding one and said, ""This is a foil."" She held it in one hand and kind of swirled it and then lunged forward at me. She started from so far away she wound up two feet short, but the distance she'd closed in that lunge was amazing. Like, she covered twelve feet in a blink.

Still, it seemed completely useless. Long and flexible, and no slicing edge. It was only sharp at the point. You can poke holes into mollusks all day long and they will crawl up your sword and rip you apart. It's why we all carry katanas.

She set it down and faced the rack. ""Epee, saber, small sword, rapier …"" She touched each as she moved down the rack. ""We can't carry a bunch of this stuff … I think these two."" She took the rapier and small sword and wrapped them in a blanket from the bed in the room.

We started back to camp and she said, ""Don't talk about these.""

I looked at her. ""OK, I won't."" I thought a bit. ""Mind if I ask why?""

She looked at me, suddenly sad, her eyes reflective. ""When I die you're going to need to be tricky and surprising."" She smiled a smile that unexpectedly broke my heart, though I didn't know why at the time.

Now, I think she knew she would die soon. I've seen it before with people in the company. Them knowing their end was near and a few times, others knew too. I think that sometimes when death is near it can be felt.

I think I'll die soon too, but maybe that's just a reasonable expectation.
 
KAYLA HAD A plan for Karen. 

""Look, she's bigger and stronger than you. She's got reach. She's using an ōdachi that's longer than your katana."" Later I looked it up. It's an oversized samurai sword. I've seen her using it but never knew what it was called.

""Guess she doesn't stand a chance then.""

Kayla laughed. ""You've got some advantages. You're faster than her. A lot smarter than she is."" 

From then on we would sneak away from camp to practice with the new weapons. I know people must have noticed but no one ever mentioned it.

I wound up preferring the rapier for the extra reach, with my regular wakizashi for defense. That's the little sword, almost a long dagger, normally carried by samurai for sepukku, which is a painful disemboweling form of suicide.. Kayla taught me a fighting style where I would block a slashing attack with my small sword and lean in to stab her. She called it ""foining,""

I have to keep reminding myself that people might be reading this in 200 years, and for all I know you fight with psychic powers by then. 

Karen was using a sword designed for slicing. Mine was for poking holes. That's faster, and my sword was longer.

When we fought everything went wrong. Karen used her katana to beat down my every attack. She was so fast and unexpectedly strong, and I remember thinking that I needed to pay more attention to my soldiers, except I was pretty sure I was about to die.

She sliced my thigh and then right after she got  my ribs. I realized I was bleeding from two wounds and I would soon slow down, and she would kill me.

She saw the realization on my face and grinned, which was really her gloating. I became furious in a way I've never been. I barely remember what happened but I launched a furious attack. I've never been so strong and fast and deadly. Remembering it scares me

She tried to beat away my lunges but very quickly I had put holes into both her thighs above the knee and another through her abdomen. One of the thigh wounds pierced her femoral artery. I stepped back and we separated. We both knew that she was done. I had slash wounds but hers were deep in her muscles. She sat down heavily. ""I can't believe you beat me.""

I was trying to catch my breath. ""This didn't have to happen.""

""Yes, it did. Kayla always treated you like you were special. Everyone does. What's so special about you? I'm special too!""

Karen was in a great deal of pain, and she was bleeding out faster than me from her wounds, and I'll say that the whiny tone in her voice was because she knew she was dying.. She heard it too, and looked away, embarrassed.

I pretended I hadn't heard it. ""Do you want me to wait? Or would you like me to help?” Help her die.

When she didn't answer I was about to walk back to camp but I looked at her and changed my mind. I walked over to where she was sitting, and I sat next to her.  I took her hand and she tried to pull away for a second, but then she relaxed and I  held it. She squeezed it a bit and we sat there for a while. 

Karen was a brave and loyal soldier, and tried her best. She had a tough life and died young and she deserved better.

I WALKED BACK to camp with some difficulty. Gretchen met me on the way. Bad dog. 

She put her head down and wouldn't look at me. She knew she had been bad but I couldn't blame her. “You're a good girl.”

She looked at me carefully and sniffed my wounds, then tried to lick the one on my thigh, which I wouldn't let her do. I guess she was satisfied I wasn't dying but she still seemed concerned. “Let's go home baby.” She kept looking for a minute, then turned and led the way.

When I got back Lilly  had me sit down and summoned a medic, who patched me up. The rest of the girls came up to me and we all pressed heads and then we got the hell out of there. We had been about to return to base anyway, and with our casualties it was about time. 

I'm not allowed to write about the location of the base, or really anything. The swords we found in River Ridge? We might have found them in New Jersey, or San Francisco. So, maybe anywhere. You'll never know. Eventually we returned to the base.

But when I passed by — well, walked by, let’s be honest — you locked eyes with me and didn’t look away. You told me I had a beautiful smile, and despite the fact that I was drenched in sweat and probably wheezing, I felt beautiful in that moment.

I smiled back, and then I was past you, swallowed up by the crowd again. But you stayed in my head for the rest of the race.

You know how everyone says to put yourself out there? Well, I did. Sort of.

I decided to take my dog to the dog park because, let’s face it, she’s the most consistent relationship I’ve got right now. There I was in my “don’t talk to me until I’ve had coffee” outfit: sweatpants, messy bun, and an oversized sweater. Basically the opposite of what you see on those dating apps.

Of course, this was the exact moment a very attractive man (maybe mid-50s) decided to strike up a conversation with me. And who started it? My dog, who ran right up to him and dropped her slobbery ball at his feet.

He smiled at me and said, “Your dog has good taste.” I smiled back, trying not to trip over my own feet as I answered something awkward like, “She’s very social. I’m… working on it.”

We ended up chatting for almost half an hour about our dogs, our jobs, and how he’s new to the area. It was easy and fun, and I realized halfway through that I hadn’t thought about my divorce or my age once.

Here’s the best part: he asked if we wanted to meet up for a walk sometime soon. He said, “I’d like to see your dog again. And you too, of course.” It was simple, sweet, and felt real.

So that’s how I learned that sometimes, you don’t need a dating app or a fancy outfit to find a little spark. Sometimes all it takes is a dog, a slobbery ball, and the willingness to say yes to a random conversation.

Wish me luck for the walk next weekend. I’m hoping to find a decent outfit by then.",57,1748812846.0,datingoverfifty,14,0.98,False

1l1071s,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1l1071s/struggling_as_an_introvert/,struggling as an introvert,"i joined a cafe a week ago and while i like the actual cafe, i hate working there already because i don't fit in....

most of the staff are very chatty, and the part timers are young students. i'm young too but it's been 3 years since i graduated so i have nothing in common with them. they're very loud and extroverted characters and i'm the exact opposite. i see the cafe as my workplace, not a place to mingle. i clock in and do the work that is required, then clock out and go home. 

recently, i had a shift with 2 of the student part timers and they were chatting to each other the whole time until one of them clocked out. they tried pulling me into the conversations but they asked me very dead end questions and continued chatting to each other. it's whatever to me but when one of them leaves and it's just the 2 of us, i feel the tension.

i'm honestly not great at talking, i feel stupid whenever i talk and i feel like people think i'm stupid. so i end up just shutting up and just doing my work in silence. but it clashes when the other person is a louder personality and is forced to work in a boring environment because of me. i feel like she was cursing in her head the entire time. and i feel like she is the type to talk about people she doesn't like behind their backs (because she did it about another person). i don't know when people are joking or teasing, i tend to take things literally which makes me come off as dumb and boring. 

my last cafe, people knew and caught on that i like to work in quietness but is up for a chat every now and then and they respected that. but we were all a bit older and closer in age, in similar stages of life and all just trying to get by in adulthood. but now, the age and personality difference is just too big that i feel like they won't be understanding. 

the customers are also majority regulars from when the shop first opened. and now they see a new face, they like to shout over me saying to another staff ""you know me, you know my usual order. she needs to get it right"" and i'm invisible most of the time with customers saying bye to the others except me. i end up just standing on the side very awkwardly while they have their 20 minute chat - no introductions or anything. i've had a few customers check in on me and wish me luck with the job, but majority of them treat me like i'm not there. 

it's extremely difficult working in coffee as an introvert. so much of the job is keeping close relationships with customers, or chit chatting with your coworkers in case they don't like your presence. after all, you're working 8 hour shifts with them everyday. i wish people were more understanding that not everyone will have a bright personality. its only been a week and i'm already exhausted and drained ",2,1748812677.0,barista,0,1.0,False

We recently moved into a Southwest-style home and are trying to make our living room feel more cohesive, intentional, and aligned with both the architecture and good feng shui. I’d love your input on layout, color, decor, and energy flow!

Some context:
	•	We bought the grey La-Z Boy sectional well before we bought the home—it’s comfy and great for our family, but I’m not sure it fits with the warm, earthy tones (saltillo tile, plaster fireplace, etc.) so some advice on dome different throw pillows to liven it up would be great.
	•	I plan to repaint the white corner shelves to matte black (they feel a little aged to me) to better match the fireplace and ceiling fan and black accents throughout the rest of the home.
	•	I’m drawn to a soft, earthy-modern aesthetic—think warm neutrals, some contrast, but not too bold. I love pieces that feel calming and grounded but am also open to burnt orange, deep greens, leathers, etc.
	•	I’m also hoping to apply feng shui principles to improve flow and balance.

Looking for advice on:
	•	Which wall art would work best? I’m leaning toward a large statement piece behind the sofa (eyeing acousart) and potentially a smaller or more minimal piece behind the TV or multiple small pieces behind the TV
	•	Accent color suggestions that work with the terracotta floors, white plaster fireplaxe, and wood ceilings but still modernize the space. Thinking to paint the wall with the windows and shelves a bold color and the others a soft light gray.
	•	Whether to lime wash or Venetian plaster the kiva fireplace, and what color you’d recommend if I do. Should I leave it as-is or soften the contrast with the white?
	•	Coffee table recommendations—something warmer or lighter? The current one feels dark and maybe a little too stark.
	•	Should we mount the TV (lower on the wall, maybe?) or keep it on the console? And what small decor items could warm up the console without adding clutter and same with fireplace decor.
	•	Ideas for curtains, lighting (floor or table), and shelf styling that would bring in texture and warmth while keeping the space feeling airy.
	•	Any additional feng shui tips welcome—especially for this kind of open living space with lots of corners and hard surfaces!

Thanks so much in advance—I’m feeling stuck between styles and would love fresh eyes!

To throw a wrench in things, I’m going for mid-century modern but my husband is a hunter and has two oryx that are European-mount style that he would like me to incorporate into the space (he thinks on the inner side of both book cases next to the top shelves).

Hey MaximizeMe fam! Let’s dive into something that’s been a game-changer for me and maybe even put a little extra pep in your step too! 

You ever look at someone super successful and think, *“What’s their secret?”* Is it the all-night grind or the million-dollar ideas? Nah, sometimes it’s just the tiny habits they’ve mastered. 

I remember sitting in a coffee shop, minding my own business, when I overheard two folks chatting about their morning routines. One of them casually mentioned a *micro-habit* that has stuck with me ever since: **journaling for just five minutes each morning.** 📖 

At first, I thought, *“Really? Is that all?”* But then I gave it a shot, and BOY, was I blown away! Here’s why I love it:

- **Clarity:** In just a few lines, you’re sorting through your thoughts and lining up your goals. It’s like a personal pep talk!
- **Gratitude Boost:** Writing down one thing you’re grateful for kicks negativity to the curb. Try it—it's like turning life's contrast dial from black-and-white to full color! 🌈
- **Mindfulness:** Being present in those few minutes helps center you before the day gets wild. Imagine sipping your coffee while your mind is calm and focused instead of running a million miles an hour. 

And here’s the kicker—**you don’t have to be an author.** Absolutely no pressure! Just let the words flow the way they want. Here’s my simple approach:

1. Grab a notebook (or a fancy app if that’s your vibe).
2. Set a timer for **5 minutes**.
3. Write about anything: your goals, dreams, or even that sandwich you had for lunch! Just write!

At first, it felt awkward. I mean, who talks to themselves on paper? But then I thought, *“Who cares?”* I was getting my thoughts out and feeling lighter by the end of it! 

So, I’m curious—what’s YOUR micro-habit that you've adopted from someone you admire? Is it something as small as setting a specific bedtime or maybe a daily walk? Let’s inspire each other with those little nuggets of wisdom that make the big difference. ✨",1,1748812370.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False
1l1003j,https://i.redd.it/mgqxqo0jsd4f1.jpeg,Expressing My Love For The Shining.,"So, I finished Stephen King's 'The Shining' this evening, curled up with a cat and a cup of coffee. The Shining   was my fifth venture into King's discography and let me say, it did not disappoint. Although I'd never read The Shining, I vividly knew of it - or thought I did. Although 416 pages later, I've come to find my view on The Shining was clearly formed by Stanley Kubrick's 1980 film. Whilst the film holds it's own merit as a masterpiece, I cannot deny my love and affinity for the novel as one of my favourite books ever. 

Anyways, that enough about me, let's talk about Stephen King's The Shining. 

Let's begin with the characters. Jack Torrance is a character indeed. Constantly throughout the book I changed perspectives between feeling dreadfully sympathetic towards Jack and feeling terribly hateful towards him - and I suppose that's what King intended. His character is so deeply layered and flawed, is he a good man? A bad man? No... he's a weak man. Jack's insecurities permeate the novel. His ideas upon a 'Father's role in the family', shaped by his abusive childhood, leave most of his actions (until the end) fairly ambiguous. It's the ambiguity about his character that make him so compelling. Until he fully succumbs to the Overlook's influence (we'll get to the Overlook), we are left semi-wondering whether his actions are spurred by the hotel or whether they're sparked by thoughts that have been there the whole time. His alcoholism is another facet of his character, one the Overlook preys upon. It's this addiction, this need, this lust and weakness for alcohol that makes Jack succumb to the Overlook and it illustrates a perfect picture of a WEAK character. Now, further looking at my description of Jack's ambiguity, we see a man who clearly loves his wife and son. Tender moments between the Torrances are hardly few and far between, however they are permeated by pangs of violence and abuse. I found myself endlessly disappointed and angry at Jack, a character so close and yet so far from being a 'good' man. It's my personal belief the Overlook's choice of weapon for Jack wraps his character up perfectly. The Roque mallet has a hard side and a soft side - to allow the wielder to better control how hard they hit the ball. This mallet is perfect for Jack, a man who possesses a soft side and a hard side, yet continuously lets his hard side win out over his soft side!

Wendy Torrance is perhaps my favourite character in The Shining. Despite her depiction in the film, as a woman strong in some ways, the novel's Wendy to resolutely a strong character. A battered woman, no doubt, mentally and emotionally abused by her alcoholic husband. We see a deep character in Wendy, one tormented by her overbearing Mother, who dictates how Wendy should raise her own son and one abused by her Husband, who also has ideas about how their son should be raised. However, in the climax of the novel it isn't Jack or her mother who ultimately tries to save Danny, it's her who constantly puts herself in harm's way to protect her son. That's how she's a strong character, resilient and resolute in her love for her son. I rooted for her throughout the novel and unlike with Jack, my support of her never wavered. 

Danny Torrance wraps up our main trio. There's a lot to say about Danny, most of which can be surmised by saying 'My god, the boy is like five, get him the hell out of there!' I felt gutted each and every time violence against Danny was mentioned, whether it was by Jack, the woman in 217 or otherwise. He's a strong character in his own right, battling something beyond his youthful comprehension. His personal struggle with the Shine is powerful, a harsh metaphor for lost innocence. His triumph and consequent escape at the end of the novel was wonderful and bittersweet, his character is defined by his Father's abuse and love, it's an odd juxtaposition that certainly didn't fail to nearly get a tear from me. Jack's final line to him was crushing: 'Run away, Danny. Quick. And remember how much I love you.'

Now, Dick Halloran is a wonderful character too, acting as a mentor to Danny on the nature of the shine. His rescue at the end of the novel was brilliant and the scene in the shed made me put the book down, most certainly fearing the worst! However, his nature as a side-character makes me keep my discussion of him brief - far too brief!

Now, it's time for the Overlook...

Wow! What a setting... The Overlook is so deep and rich and brimming with history and lore - often my favourite parts of a King novel. Whether it's the dubious previous owners, gangster influence, disturbing murders and above average death rate, after all 'just like every big hotel, \[the Overlook\] has got a ghost. Why? Hell, people come and go.' Throughout the novel the hotel just has a presence, thick and oily and malicious. The excellent super-natural horror which cements this work as, in the words of Peter Straub, 'Obviously a masterpiece, probably the best supernatural novel in a hundred years' comes too often from the atmosphere in (and outside of) the Overlook. Whether it's the lady of room 217, the topiaries which are all too alive, the never-ending party in the ballroom, the elevator or any one of the other entities which wander the Overlooks endless, jungle-like halls, the novel has enough horror, that's for sure - it's good horror too. The Overlook is, besides Derry, perhaps my favourite fictional setting ever - thanks King!

Now, this post isn't a summary of the Novel - if you haven't, go read it yourself - it's a brief look into characters, setting and themes. However, I do just want to touch upon certain moments that stood out to me, scenes I have not the time to touch on. If you know, you know:

. The REDRUM reveal!

. Danny on the staircase and his parent's consequence finger-pointing!

. The Dogman... my god, that was horrifying!

. 'Hi Lloyd!'

. The fishing... 'The world's a hard place, Danny. It don't care. It don't hate you and me, but it don't love us, either. Terrible things happen in the world, and they're things no one can explain.'

Anyways, I hope there's some sense in these ramblings and I hope my love of this novel is clear! On to Carrie and I'm thoroughly excited to see what else King has to offer.

The Shining is a masterpiece, end of story, no ifs and no buts, goodnight folks, I'm tired!",9,1748812198.0,stephenking,2,1.0,False

Previously, I worked at a licensed Starbucks, so I’m still getting used to how corporate runs things and learning the newer machines.

This happened on Friday morning, and it was busy. I had so many mobile orders and café stickers coming out, and I was doing my best to keep up. People were also walking up to the window to order. I took the first order from a lady who asked for a decaf coffee with cream. The older guy behind her ordered a Pike’s Place coffee with cream.

I’m guessing one of my coworkers overheard both orders and ended up finishing his coffee before the lady’s. I set his coffee aside while I quickly finished hers, because I know we’re supposed to hand out drinks in the order they were placed.

When I finally got to him, he started yelling at me, saying he saw my coworker make his coffee and that I had just left it sitting there. I apologized and explained that I was trying to get the drinks out in the correct order. He snapped, “I don’t care! If it’s a quick coffee, just hand it out!!”

I tried my best not to cry in that moment and waited until my break to tear up. Everyone saw what happened and didn’t say anything to him. I lowkey feel like they don’t like me because I’m still new and make mistakes from time to time. I always feel guilty for not being the best “barista” to work with, but I’m still learning 🥲

PART ONE

Stacie primped in the mirror making sure her makeup was just perfect. I knelt an polished her tan high heels.

“Make sure you get the scuff marks off the toe.”

“Yes Dear.” That was automatic response to anything that came out of Stacie’s mouth. Blind obedience. 

She looked ravaging with a strapless denim dress that was slit almost up to her waist which I had purchased online at her whim last night and paid extra to be delivered today. Per usual she wore no bra or panties. She dabbed perfume behind each her and stuck her foot out for me to put her shoes on. She was beautiful. My Queen. She was a BBW and big in all the right places, big, beautiful tits, thighs and ass and a belly to die for. Her curly hair cascaded down past her shoulders, and her ample cleavage was on display for anyone to see.

“Where are you guys going?” I asked, knowing her cruel way of teasing me was to sometimes tell me and other times totally ignore my questions. 

“Louis found this quaint inn where they have the most divine lobster and a cute little bar, and of course, rooms to rent upstairs!”

I sighed.

“Aw poor cucky, are you jealous? Does it bother you to know I’m going out AGAIN with Louis?”

“I’m trying Dear I really am. It’s just that….” My voice drifted off.

“It’s just that what?” Come on, tell mama what’s bothering you.

I hated it sometimes when she referred to herself as mama, but she knew it turned me on. She knew the inappropriate relationship I had with my own mother and that it turned me on and made me into the submissive I am today, and she never shied away from pushing those buttons. 

“It’s just that all the other men you’ve been with, it’s all been about sex, but it seems different with him. It’s almost like you’re dating him, like he’s your boyfriend, even though I’m your husband.”

Kindly, she reached out and lovingly brushed my face. “Well baby he IS my boyfriend. And all those other guys, well, I would see them to get fucked and that was all well and good, but when you introduced me to your new boss at the annual Christmas party I was smitten! And don’t forget it was YOU who introduced me and YOU who egged me on to flirt with him and YOU who came in three seconds that night as I jerked your little pathetic cock off telling you about how I danced with him and could feel his hard cock through his pants. Just like your little clitty is dripping now as I remind you about it all!”

She stood, took one last look in the mirror, and walked out of the room. I stood, wearing my black leggings and pink t-shirt with cuckold cleanup boy emblazoned across the front and followed her outside. She got into the passenger seat as I got into the driver’s side and drove. Another emasculating and humiliating thing; having to drive your wife to her dates with your boss. As I drove, she vaped on some pot, and I could tell she was getting a buzz on. By the time we reached the inn she had given me directions to she was high and horny. Louis stood at the entrance waiting. I of course, was required to get out of the car for everyone to see and walk around and open her door and escort her to him. My boss had a shit eating grin on his face as he looked at us, the couple he now owned. He was tall and good looking, his gray hair slicked back, his dress white shirt crisp and showing off his physique. He had a mustache and goatee both gray also in contrast to my totally hairless body. When we reached him, he took Stacie’s hand and kissed it. 

“Darling! You look ravishing! Good enough to eat! And I certainly will ravish you and eat you today!” He laughed a hearty, manly laugh and the two of them went into the inn leaving me standing there alone.

Meekly, I climbed back into the car and drove home. This had all started when Stacie and I went down the road of a female-led relationship when we were first married. I have a very tiny cock (she calls it a clitty) and I knew I could never satisfy her and so we decided that a female-led relationship where she called the shots and could date other men if I was involved would be the way to go. That was seven years ago, and our sex life has always been great with her finding men and bringing them home and me serving her and them. But it was always just sex until Louis. It all began at the Christmas party Stacie had mentioned earlier. 

They flirted with each other openly if not brazenly. And she was right; I did cum very quickly that night as she talked to me about him. Unlike her other hook ups, the communication between the two at first strange as it went through me. Louis would tell me something to pass on to her such as how gorgeous she looked at the party, what a great dancer she was, how her body was fantastic. And she in turn would send messages back through me. The process, while odd, was also titillating and exciting for me. And then they slept together at his condo and the next morning he told me to tell her he had never felt a woman get so wet as he entered her. I was jealous, angry, hurt, upset, and yes, turned on! She in turn sent both of us a text message photo of her, in it, her hair was wet, lips pouty, cleavage on display. But instead of responding back to her, he texted me and had me text her!!  “*those arched brows, of course your full bosom, with cleavage ‘showing’ and your ‘wet’ curls mmmm but most of all, your pouty lips and kissable dimples…that Babygirl ‘look’ and big, beautiful wide eyes…I want to steal you away from your sissy…and make plans to shame him and break him even more (if that’s possible ha ha).* 

I was so humiliated and yet so turned on!!! They began to see each other in non-sexual ways, movies, concerts, dinners, and all on my dime. I must confess, it all turned me on. She was a Queen and he a King and I their humble serf. Last weekend, they went away together and left me home alone. I was in agony. One of the things that has turned me on so is their ganging up on me. Stacie will come home with an idea, and I know it’s something the two of them have dreamt up to further emasculate and humiliate me. First it was to order me to always remain hairless and so the only hair on my entire body are my eyebrows. Next, came the idea of making me wear women’s black leggings whenever I went out to run errands on the weekends or after work. At home, Stacie already had me prancing around in a pink ballerina’s tutu, my tiny clitty always on display for her lovers to see, but it was even more humiliating and emasculating. There has even been hints of a chastity device. 

It’s painful some nights when I’m kneeling there massaging her feet and she is so enthralled exchanging texts with Louis it’s as if I’m not even there. And work is a whole other world. I’m often summoned to Louis’ office and told to close the door while he is FaceTiming with Stacie and requires me to drop my pants and show him what frilly underwear or pantyhose, I’m wearing that day. And often I’m then required to kneel while they are talking and give him a blowjob. Talk about humiliating! Of course, I go away with the taste of his cum in my mouth, dripping. That is what drives me crazy; the emotional involvement the two of them have. 

The next morning, Louis dropped Stacie off back at home and didn’t come in. Stacie came in carrying her heels and flopped on the couch and put her feet up on the coffee table. I scurried to get her a coffee and began giving her a foot massage. I knew better than to ask how her night was, if she wanted me to know, she’d tell me. So, I sat silently like the puppy I am and massaged her feet. She scrolled through her phone and finally set it down.

“Oh God, I’m exhausted. That man exhausts me and takes my breath away!!” 

My heart sank and I tried to catch my breath. I tried not to offend her in any way and just continued to massage. What she said next bowled me over.

“Louis and I think it’s time we take our relationship to the next level.”

“Whose relationship? Yours and his or mine and yours?” I was confused.

“All of ours, silly!” 

I gulped. “What would that entail?”

“Well, we were talking and it’s stupid for us to have two different places. So we thought it would be best for all of us if he moved in here and really became the man of the house so to speak. Now before you get your panties all in a ruffle, this is going to happen. So let me speak before you interrupt me and I’ll tell you exactly what’s going to happen so you don’t have to worry your pretty little head about it.”

My heart was racing, palms sweating, clitty dripping. 

“Louis has sold his condo furnished, so next Saturday you are to go there and move anything he’s marked here. It’s mostly all his personal stuff so you can probably get it done with a small U-Haul truck. In the meantime, you need to make room in the master bedroom for him and move all your stuff out of there. We’ve decided to give you the tiny room next to ours and although I know it’s tiny we thought a bed and a tiny dresser will just about fit in there for you. You really don’t need more. Louis already picked out a cute pink canopied bed and a tiny pink dresser which is being delivered Thursday, so you’ll have to make sure you move everything out of there and we want the walls painted pink, so you must do that before Thursday too. Oh, and he’s so cruel! He decided to have an automatic lock put on the door which can only be opened by either mine or his cell phone. That way, if you misbehave or are being punished, we don’t have to worry about keeping an I on you and it will also be great for those time we want to be alone.”

My head was spinning, and I thought I was going to pass out. My face was flushed, and my heart was beating like a drum. Stacie saw this and patted the cushion next to her on the couch and helped me up and had me sit there. She patted my leg and my clitty sprang to attention and began dripping. 

“Once all that is done, Louis will take your spot in the garage, and we thought since you don’t really need a car you can sell yours and take the bus to work. Even though the two of you work together, Louis didn’t think it would be good for you two to be seen driving in his car to work. So, get on that asap and put your car on Facebook Marketplace. We are going to use the money from your car to go on a cruise. Next, since you already do all the cooking, cleaning, laundry, housework and yardwork you’ll continue to do those. However, Louis and I will be taking our meals in the dining room where you’ll serve us. You will be allowed to take your meals in the kitchen. However, Louis came up with what I thought was a brilliant idea, he’s so mean! You can only eat our leftovers AND you can only eat them when we tell you. So after each meal you can scrape our leftovers into a bowl and set it on the kitchen table. Then, when you’re done serving us and we are settled in and if you’ve been good, we will give you permission to eat. And if you’re very good, Louis may give you some ‘special sauce’ for your food.” She laughed an evil laughed and I shuddered. 

Around the house you will wear what we tell you depending on our mood. You will address Louis as either Master Louis or King Louis and you will address me as Mistress Stacie or Queen Stacie, you can also use ‘my King’ or ‘my Queen’ and when we’re in public it will be Ma’am and Sir.”

I felt ill, my whole body was shaking. I was going to be sick. I jumped up and dashed for the bathroom and became violently ill. Stacie came in and stood next to me and put a cold washcloth to my face. 

“There, there, this is all new and it’s coming as a shock to you. But it will all be as normal as when you and I first started our female-led relationship. Remember, that took some getting used to?” 

I nodded my head. 

“And this will too. It will take some time, but you’ll get used to it. Louis and I will be equals in the house, he the Alpha male, me the Alpha female, you the quintessential beta all three of us know you were born to be.” She helped me up, told me to brush my teeth and meet her back in the living room. 

I sat on the couch and drank a glass of water, still queasy and flushed as she went on.

“Now, as to finances. Just as all your money these past seven years have gone into an account with my name, it will now go into a joint account with mine and Louis’ name. I’m also going to put his name on the house since he’s going to be living here.”

“Are you in falling in love with him?” I blurted it out so unexpectedly I began to cry. 

“No, silly, I’m not FALLING in love with him I’ve FALLEN in love with him.”

It was 30 minutes before Michael, Joel, and Donie should have returned to the bunker. Raymond stepped out of the back seat of a black sedan with a scowl. He looked over to see the SUV they had taken still parked in front of the run-down bar. He shook his head in disappointment. Two other large, sharply dressed men walked up behind him.

He glanced at both of them quickly and nodded toward the bar. They walked purposefully, the two large men placing their hands on concealed firearms. Raymond pushed open the front door.

“What the fuck happened here?”

Michael sat on the ledge of a skyscraper overlooking the city. He watched as cars passed below, heading somewhere late at night. He sighed, diving back into his mental library and trying to integrate his new power into his martial arts. It was a lot simpler to add than his other powers, as it just enhanced what was already there instead of giving him new options to consider.

A loud thump on the roof behind him pulled him from his thoughts. He whirled around and came face to face with a man dressed in a green suit covering everything but his mouth, chin, and two eagle-like wings sprouting from his back. He walked forward with a scowl and placed his hands on his hips.

*Ah, great. One of Raymond's so-called heroes. Just play it cool and hope he doesn’t recognize me.* “Who the hell are you?”

“Me? I'm the person who's perch you're stealing. Who the hell are you?” he asked in an offended tone.

“Still didn’t answer my question,” Michael sighed, jumping down from the ledge he was sitting on.

“Don’t you know?” the man asked, gesturing to his costume.

“Uhhh, No.”

“I’m the green eagle and the newest protector of this city.”

Michael looked at the man with a confused expression. “Never heard of you.”

The man let out a gasp and gaped at Michael. “I’ll let you know I have been featured on multiple news channels recently and have contributed to keeping this city safe, just like Wonder Boy.”

Michael let out a choked laugh.

“What’s so funny?”

“Look man, I know you have to put up an act so the general populous doesn’t know but you can cut the crap. I know you work for Raymond.”

The green eagle scratched his head. “Who?”

“Don’t give me that bullshit. We both know there are no legitimate superheroes in this city.”

“Uhh, have you gone mad? There's Wonder Boy, Viperlash, me, and that's just naming the popular ones.”

“And all of them work for or with Raymond.”

“Look man you can keep saying his name all you want but I’m still not going to know who the fuck that is.”

Michael cocked his head and stared at the man for a good few moments. “You’re serious, aren't you?”

Green Eagle shrugged and gave a slight nod. “What part of this conversation made you think I was joking?”

“The part where you weren't working for Raymond, are popular, and can still have a conversation…”

“Still have no idea what the fuck you are talking about.”

“Oh, right, it's a long story, but you know who Deckmaster is, right?” Michael launched into the entire story of Raymond and Wonder Boy’s criminal enterprise. “And that’s why you should get out of this city if you want any chance of being an actual hero.”

“Yeah, I don’t believe a word you just said. There is not a chance in hell Wonder Boy would work with his arch-nemesis. I've met him, and he's a pretty cool guy.”

“Look, I know it might seem hard to believe, but you should get out of here while you still can.”

“Yeah, no, I ain’t buying into your conspiracy theory bullshit just so you can steal my perch.”

“I don’t give a damn about your perch. I’m trying to save your life.”

“Look man, you’re obviously on something to come up with a story like that so why don’t you fuck off and I won’t bring you down to the police station to spend a night sobering up.”

Michael pinched the bridge of his nose. “You know what? Fuck it. If you don’t want to listen, why should I even bother? Have fun becoming another of his lackeys or ending up as nothing more than a red smear on the pavement.” He jumped, igniting the flames in his palms.

“I hope you get the help you need, man. That shits not good for you,” Green Eagle called after him.

He shook his head and let out a low growl. *Fucking idiot.*

Michael spent a long time watching the city from high in the sky before his drowsiness began to catch up with him. He soared up to find another skyscraper to land on. There was no way he would trust going to a hotel, but he needed at least a few hours of rest before making his debut.

He planned to start acting as a new superhero who had come to town and wait until Raymond’s henchmen approached him. He was sure that he would not survive a full-frontal assault, but if he could cause enough damage to the body, then maybe he could lure out its head.

He pulled on the roof access door and was happy to find it unlocked. He shut it behind him and walked down to a small outlet where the stairs turned. He lay down, using his backpack as a pillow. *Hopefully, no one needed to go up to the roof* *anytime soon,* he thought, slowly drifting to sleep.

He woke up around midday the next day with a mild neck cramp. After some time stretching, he decided to make his way further into the building to see if he could find a bathroom without being noticed. To help with that, he pulled his mask off but kept his hood up to obscure his face. To his surprise, he found the top floor of the building almost entirely empty.

He made his way back outside and noted the building's location. It was a good place to rest for the next few nights. He flew around the city several times, looking for anything that could be a good debut for him. Sadly, there were no perfectly timed bank robberies. He eventually settled for sitting on top of the building he had slept in and watching the news.

*Any time now.*

After almost an hour of nothing happening, he grew tired of watching weather reports and news about which team was winning which championship. He dived into his mental library, going over all his skills. He was just about to go through combos using electricity and the ability to harden. When a tall, thin man wearing a disheveled, collared shirt and a loosened black tie, standing on the ledge, caught the corner of his eye.

Michael turned to face the man, but as soon as he did, no one was there. “What the?”

“You… know…”

Michael nearly fell off the building as the man appeared next to him. He caught himself with a quick burst of flight, landed on the roof, and turned to face the man in a combat-ready stance. He nearly fell off the edge again when he got a good look at him. His body looked like he had been dead for weeks, and rot had already begun to set in. On top of that, Michael could see straight through him like he was not there.

“You… know… where am?”

A strange sense of déjà vu hit Michael. He had heard that voice before, and even though it was half rotten, he could have sworn he had seen his face somewhere before.

“You… know… where am?” he repeated slowly, careful to pronounce every syllable.

“Uhh, on top of a skyscraper,” Michael answered, with a confused look.

The half-rotted man looked around for a few moments. “I–” He suddenly faded away, leaving Michael alone again.

Michael shook his head, tightly shutting his eyes and opening them again, revealing a still empty rooftop.

“I need coffee,” he muttered with a sigh.

There’s a barbershop next door. One of the ladies who works there comes almost every day to get a sandwich from us and sometimes she’s the only one working at the barbershop. So she orders and we just run the food next door. She’s nice for the most part and I’ve never really paid attention to whether or not she tips. 

However, today she came in with some of the other employees. I didn’t ring her up nor did I hear this first hand but my coworker heard her say “god! I just don’t understand why we have to tip these baristas. All they do is make coffee and it’s their f*cking job!! We shouldn’t have to tip them for doing their job!” 

I’m so annoyed. I don’t want to make this lady’s day worse when she orders but I also want some petty revenge. She never orders coffee so I can’t just make her lattes decaf. 

I’m not even annoyed that she didn’t/ doesn’t tip. I’m annoyed that she said that because I know she’s a tipped employee too because she’s a hairdresser. To use her logic, it’s her job to cut hair and all she does is do buzzcuts so she shouldn’t be tipped either. ",18,1748811654.0,barista,8,0.95,False

My grandad passed away a few months back and this is when I really got to see the real her. I needed space as honestly my grandad was like my father to me, during my parents divorce as a kid I lived with him for a few years, and losing him was one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to deal with. she listened… For about 2 days, and then after she nagged me enough I agreed to go for a coffee with her (which she made me pay for entirely) after this she acted as though I should be perfectly back to normal. Constantly trying to get intimate with me even when I was telling her I wasn’t in the mood, and every second of every day messaging me then getting mad at me for not responding in “a good amount of time” even telling me only a week after he passed away that i “should just get over it by now.” this was insane to me because if she had just lost someone close to her and needed space I would’ve given it to her for as long as she needed. After a few days of me completely blanking her I finally snapped at her after she had messaged me on multiple accounts. I told her to just leave me alone and that I didn’t want anything to do with her, that she was selfish etc etc… and I know that I could have been a little less harsh. But I felt it was the right thing to do.

## FAQs Section

Choosing the right iPhone 16 wallet case can be daunting. Here are some frequently asked questions to guide your decision-making process.

**Will the wallet case add significant bulk to my iPhone 16?**

Some minimalist designs add very little bulk, while cases with multiple card slots and a cash pocket will naturally be thicker. Consider your storage needs and prioritize a slim profile if bulk is a concern. Many manufacturers provide dimensions and weight specifications, allowing you to compare options.

**Does the magnetic closure interfere with my iPhone 16's functionality?**
High-quality wallet cases utilize magnets that are carefully designed to avoid interfering with your iPhone 16's functionality. These magnets are typically positioned away from sensitive components and are not strong enough to cause any damage or disruption. However, it's always a good idea to choose a case from a reputable manufacturer known for its quality control and attention to detail.

**How durable are the card slots in wallet cases?**
The durability of card slots depends on the material and construction of the wallet case. Cases made from genuine leather or high-quality synthetic materials tend to have more durable card slots than those made from cheaper materials. Look for cases with reinforced stitching around the card slots to prevent tearing or stretching over time. Proper card insertion will also help prolong the life of the card slots.

**Can I wirelessly charge my iPhone 16 with a wallet case on?**
Some wallet cases are specifically designed to be compatible with wireless charging. These cases typically have a slim profile around the charging area, allowing for efficient energy transfer. However, thicker wallet cases or those with metal components may interfere with wireless charging.Always check the manufacturer's specifications to ensure wireless charging compatibility. If unsure, you may need to remove the case for optimal wireless charging performance.

1l0zlyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/DunkinDonuts/comments/1l0zlyj/i_worked_8_months_at_dunkin_and_ill_never_go_back/,I worked 8 months at Dunkin and I'll never go back,"After working 8 months at my local dunkin, I learned that I love making drinks for people, but also learned that most of the dunkin workers don't care about you at all, and honestly it was really sad to see.

1. One of my coworkers used to use regular caffeinated coffee when we didn't have decaf ready, which could absolutely kill someone when the wrong person drinks it. She knew this, but didn't care. We have customers with deadly caffeine allergies and heart problems that *needed* decaf for that reason.

2. One of my managers would ignore the ""less ice"" on the stickers when making drinks, and would fill it to the absolute top of the cup (past the ice line). I'd let her know the drink was meant to have less ice, and she would say ""it's not that deep, nobody cares"".

3. They talk all kinds of shit about customers that need to look at the menu before ordering (likely their first time at dunkin, so they didn't know what we had, which is exactly why the menu is out there). My coworkers would get so mad saying stuff like ""why would even they come here if they don't know what we have?""  That's why they're looking at the menu?? To see what we have??? Cmon.

4. The racism was RAMPANT. any time we had a group of people come in that weren't black or white, they'd get me to take their order saying ""they probably don't even speak English I'm not taking them"", so I'd take their order and guess what? They spoke English. Literally just pure racism man.

5. Most of the time they wouldn't put all of the toppings on the signature lattes. The only difference between a caramel latte and a caramel craze signature latte is the whipped cream, caramel drizzle, and cinnamon sugar. The toppings are what you pay extra for, but at my store you almost *never* got the cinnamon sugar or hot chocolate powder. Sure it doesn't sound like a big deal, but it is when that's literally what the customer pays extra for.

6. When you ask for something to be left out of your drink or changed, a lot of the time they didn't care and would make it the regular way anyways, again saying ""it's not a big deal who cares"" the customer maybe? The one who's paying for their drink to be made right?? Literally says it on the ticket and you're making it wrong purely out of spite. Come on.

7. They did an awful job stirring your drinks, and for hot coffees they usually didn't stir them at all, even when the customer asks to make sure it's stirred well. For a hot coffee with cream and sugar for example, they'd put the cream in, sugar in, hot coffee on top, lid it and send it to the drive thru/front counter, saying ""it stirs it when you put the coffee in"" no it does not lmfao. They were suuuper bad about not stirring sweet tea and sparkd energy too. Sweet tea always had the liquid sugar sitting on the bottom and the sparkd energies almost always had all the syrup at the bottom and the sparkling water on top. Nobody wants that.

Ontop of that, when I'd stir someone's drink I often got told by my coworkers I was too slow and I need to just fill it and put a lid on it.

I'm sure there's plenty more that I can't think of right now, but that alone is a lot I think. On a better note, I found out it's a ton of fun making drinks for people and I'm currently waiting on a reply from the manager at a small local café I applied to, really excited to work somewhere where (hopefully) people care a lot more. Working at dunkin actually made me realize I might want to open my own little café some day & this next potential job is gonna get me some really good experience for it",8,1748811248.0,DunkinDonuts,0,0.9,False

Early on, he made a “joke” when we were lying in bed and he held me closely. He said the following “I could just easily choke you to death right now if I wanted to”. It made me feel slightly uneasy as it came unexpectedly, but I brushed it off. I believe he has done this two times, and the second time I told him “why would you even say that?” And he just answered “I’m just joking”. Second instance, we were driving in his car talking about emotional intelligence and what traits we value etc. He then dropped a “I could easily manipulate you if I wanted to”. I thought of it was odd but counterpunched it with a “well, you think I’m easily manipulated but that’s just an act”, trying to ease things by joking back. Lastly and most recently, we were snacking on some fruits and I kept the knife on the coffee table in case we wanted to cut them up into smaller pieces. When I went into the kitchen to wash the dishes, he approached me from behind holding the knife (a large one too) and said “what makes you think I couldn’t just pierce this knife through you right now?”. This time I kinda froze, but calmly answered “well, cause I trust you”.

Now I only watch it when my spouse puts it on.,"In 2017 I stopped following youtubers. I was tired of all the youtube drama videos, and the youtubers I used to watch becoming progressively edgier and clickbaity. I thought the content stopped feeling human, and I missed watching an average bloke play a video game. The drama videos just seemed like an endless river of slop after a while. There's always going to be a shitbag content creator, there's always going to be dogshit going on with the site itself. There's always shitty people, and I didn't want to spend my free time being reminded of that constantly.

I guess I'm a sensitive person.

Trump winning the 2016 election also made me feel burned out on political videos, and politics in general. 

I moved in with my spouse in 2021, and he watches youtube on a big TV hooked up to his computer. We live in a small apartment, so it's hard to avoid. The stuff he watches though is either okay or bad most of the time. Sometimes I watch it with him if it's an okay dude. I don't put on anything myself, though.

I was like a lot of people, watching for 6-12 hours a day, until I decided enough was enough. I remember the month trying to quit youtube. It honestly scared the shit out of me how unwell I felt not having anything to watch, which was enough motivation to get me to stop completely. I had an easier time quitting coffee and antidepressants. After that first month though, the urge went away and I never looked back.

I still had other social media addictions, reddit and tumblr. (Reddit is hard to quit because where else am I going to go for video game help? Or niche stuff?) I've weened myself down to spending an amount of time I'm comfortable with on those sites. 

So, last time I was caught up with youtube drama, there was leafyishere being an ass, dramaalert being an ass, one of the Paul brothers fucking around in the suicide forest, and Pewdiepie losing the Disney sponsorship or whatever... Idubbz and H3H3 were hailed as saints, FilthyFrank recently quit... what's happened since then? Do I wanna know?

 - Avid adult sports league player with the soul of a poet (or at least a guy who journals sometimes).

- Will hike for a good view or coffee.

- Formerly heartbroken, currently rebuilding. Mostly relying on dumb optimism and protein shakes for that...

- Will absolutely beat you at cribbage… or any other card games.

- Collector of songs that make you feel things.

visiting the islands for the first time in a few months. i love language learning and it’s one of my favourite hobbies. usually before i go to a new country with a major language (german, portuguese, romanian even) i try to learn at least some basics to be able to introduce myself, basic pleasantries, maybe order a coffee or get the bill. 

i understand that english proficiency in the islands will likely be high - i’ve been to all the other nordic countries and never had a problem with english. 

however faroese does really interest me and especially now with ai, its easier than ever to learn languages that previously had little resources. 

my question is that if i learn a bit, would people be receptive to a foreigner using it? or would it be seen as a bit strange and people just switch straight back to english? 

for example i found in brazil and sweden, people are very happy to communicate with you as clearly a learner. however in romania and poland, i felt like people would immediately switch to english without entertaining practicing their language 

tldr if i spend some time learning the language to a basic level will people talk to me or not lol",1,1748809923.0,FaroeIslands,5,1.0,False

I take an antispsychotic (risperidone). The side effects can be quite nasty, I found this study that talks about them from a TCM view point.Heres the last part in case it won't load for you:



>, different antipsychotic drugs acted on the different human body may induce different side effects and different toxic reaction, generally including stagnation of heat in spleen-stomach, excessive heat in Yangming, excessive heat generating wind, body fluid deficiency generating wind, internal retention of phlegm and dampness, obstruction of collaterals. TCM differential treatment to antipsychotic-induced disease obtained a more signifi cant effect. Clearing away heat, purgative activity, invigorating qi, nourishing yin, activating blood flow, resolving phlegm were the basic treatment methods, of which nourishing yin, activating blood flow were of particular signifi cance.

  
I was never someone that loved cold drinks, but now I kind of cant go without them. Also the times I went off meds dairy and greasy junk food would disgust me but now I have cravings for them, it feels like the meds dry out my insides and I need a lot of fat to relubricate, so I don't eat very healthy. Im trying to cut out dairy and red meat and its working well, I noticed my sinus and breathing was much smoother, and my heat intolerance isn't as bad also my bowel movements dont smell as bad as when I eat red meat. Yesterday had a coffee with a lot of milk and woke up with tons of phlegm.

But what can you recommend for the last part of the paragraph, to 'nourish yin and activating blood flow'? What kind of lifestyle helps? I already am completely exhausted and spend a lot of time resting, but if I push too much I feel completely awful for the next few days. It feels like I spend most of my time resting and chilling, is it too much? I usually try to walk 1h per day. Yesterday I went out for a long period outside to the city center and today I feel completely depleted.

I know Im being brief so you can just focus on the paragraph I quoted, im not looking for a diagnosis.",1,1748809829.0,ChineseMedicine,4,1.0,False

6 years at a smoke house, 2 years experience fine dining. Worked many bars in between. 
My baby mama,(not together) opened a breakfast diner in a rural town, litterly no where else to get breakfast besides Casey’s pizza or donuts (ifyk)
Anyways when she first opened both of the first two cooks she had failed immediately. One was a drunk, the other barely any experience and couldn’t deliver. So about two weeks in she reaches out and practically begs me to come help her new restaurant as I’m one of the only people with legitimate kitchen experience she knew. 
I accepted because the timing was right, I just completed treatment at a rehab center and had left my job at one of the most popular steakhouses in the city near me… I wanted something more chill and I was tired of the uppity attitude of upper management of the fancier places I’ve recently worked at. 

I knew money would be tight for her in the beginning, she offered me 20 an hour which I thought was fair. 
I am now 3 months in and 2 months behind on pay, the only reason I let it slide is because I do want her to succeed… we have been getting busier and busier every week. The problem is I have no help… it’s just me. I want to believe it will work, and it has been trending positive. The only time I get paid is after the busiest Saturday service. I’m just wondering has anyone been in a similar situation? Am I an idiot for giving this much leeway? 
Or am I giving a new business a start that 90% don’t receive?
I enjoy the fact that everything besides the pastries that come out of that kitchen is 100% me and I’m prideful of that fact and how business is increasing. 
I’m just worried that her inexperience in running a restaurant will lead to me wasting more time running a kitchen and my pay deficit increasing? any thoughts? 
we serve eggs pancakes crepes burritos biscuit sands etc, she does all the pastries for the cafe aspect and there is two other employees for foh that serve and make espresso/coffees. 
We just hired part time help to prep and while he lives 5 min away compared to my 30, he is a mess and makes service harder but if I want off days he is my only option for the moment.

It’s a robot vacuum.

I figured it would clean a little, get stuck under chairs, make noise, and eventually end up as a glorified coaster like my last one.

But 30 days with the ECOVACS DEEBOT X8 PRO OMNI flipped that idea hard.

It’s not just a vacuum. It’s a full-on, hands-off, freakishly good floor butler.

Here’s what actually changed in my routine—and where it still trips up.

# No more pet hair tumbleweeds

I live with a golden retriever.

If you know, you know.

Hair collects *everywhere* within hours.

But this thing’s dual-turbine suction (18,000Pa) doesn’t play games.

I haven’t touched a broom or cordless stick vac in over 3 weeks.

If you have pets and hate shedding season,[ this one](https://amzn.to/44hnM2f) might just save your sanity.

# 2. It scrubs, not just mops

Most “mop” bots just drag a wet pad.

The X8 Pro uses a rotating OZMO Turbo 2.0 mop with real scrubbing action and downward pressure.

The difference? Night and day.

Coffee stains, dog prints, even sticky juice spots—gone without a trace.

And yeah, the dock even washes and dries the mop pad after.

# It empties itself

The onboard bin is tiny (220ml), but I don’t care.

Because it takes itself back to the OMNI dock and empties like a grown-up.

No more popping the lid, dust flying up your nose.

You hear the dock suck it out with a satisfying WHOOSH, and boom—done.

# It dodges socks and cables (mostly)

The AI-powered camera and LiDAR combo means it doesn’t just slam into everything like older models.

Cords? Toys? Pet bowls? Usually avoids them.

* Dodges bowls  
* Fails at clear plastic  
* Save zones with virtual walls  

One sock made it from the laundry room to the front door before I noticed. Pretty sure my dog was silently judging the entire time.

# Multi-floor smarts

I have upstairs and downstairs zones.

The DEEBOT mapped both with impressive detail—furniture outlines and all.

You can send it to a specific room, tell it to avoid another, or clean only the kitchen after dinner.

It even saves maps per floor, no re-learning needed.

# The app doesn’t suck

I’ve used apps from other brands that felt like 2012.

ECOVACS Home app is surprisingly modern.

Real-time location, detailed history, mopping settings, schedule options.

I can adjust suction and mop pressure mid-clean.

And the voice assistant (YIKO) is oddly responsive, though I mostly use my phone.

# Long run time = whole house

On low to medium settings, it cleaned my entire downstairs (about 1,500 sq ft) on a single charge.

If you go max suction, it dies quicker and gets louder, but I rarely need that.

Most bots need a nap halfway. This one made it through dinner, movie, and bedtime.

# My floors actually feel clean

You know the difference.

When it just looks clean vs. when it actually feels dust-free under your feet.

After a week, I stopped doing double-check wipes.

I trust it now.

And that alone is kind of wild for a robot vacuum.

# Stuff that bugged me

It’s not all smooth.

The OMNI dock is big and heavy. Needs a fixed home with power.

On max suction, it’s loud enough to interrupt a call.

If it misses an obstacle, it can drag a sock halfway across the house.

And the price—yeah, it’s not cheap.

But if you want full automation, you’re paying for time back.

If that trade-off makes sense to you,[ this thing](https://amzn.to/44hnM2f) delivers.

Y’know… something that feels good to come back to after a long day.

I’m 19. Into classic movies (yes, I love The Good, The Bad and The Ugly), emotional story games that destroy you in the best way, writing poetry and short stories when I get in my head a little too much.
Also big on books, learning languages (currently on Japanese and German), and just exploring new cultures in general.

I’m more of a mountain-and-coffee than club-and-shot type of guy. Solo travel? Big yes. Quiet sunrises? Even bigger yes.
Work-wise, life’s kinda wild—I run a marketing agency, work with an American company, and manage an NGO and school for kids who deserve better. So yeah, my schedule is chaotic—but I’m passionate about it.

What I’m looking for:
A long-term friend. Someone I can talk to regularly. Could be about deep life stuff or stupid memes. Could be voice notes at 2am or random “you gotta hear this song” moments. I’m open-minded, respectful, and not here to waste anyone’s time.
And no, I won’t ghost you. I know how to hold a convo and actually enjoy it.

If you’re down to talk, just tell me your age and gender when you message. That’s all.
Let’s make something cool out of this.

It's kinda my little routine. But the other day, I woke up feeling adventurous (or maybe just reckless? 😅) and decided to order something completely different. I was staring at the menu for an eternity, feeling this weird combo of excitement and legit fear. How can trying a new coffee drink feel so daunting?

When I finally blurted out my order for an espresso macchiato (no idea what possessed me!), I swear my heart was pounding like I’d just finished a sprint. I know it sounds silly considering the grand scheme of life's challenges, but this small shake-up in my usual pattern was terrifying yet thrilling. 

The feeling of letting go of my 'safe choice' and experimenting was kinda liberating, tbh. Sure, when I took the first sip, it was more bitter than I was used to, but there was something interesting about it that I hadn't expected. Was it a life-changing revelation? Nah, but it did make me think about how often I avoid even small risks out of habit or fear of the unknown.

Anyway, might try new things more often instead of sticking to what's predictable. Has anyone else felt this way just by switching up your coffee (or anything else)?",8,1748809213.0,edgeSteps,0,1.0,False

""Easy, Sheila, I know it's a lot to try and accept, but trust us.""

I am armbindered, nude, and strapped to an chair, above and below my breasts, with my ankles tied to the legs of the chair. I am ballgagged, but not hooded. This is so Jasmine could ""make me up"" at our upcoming promotional shoot.

I'm wearing big hoop earrings, bright red lipstick, and garish eyeshadow and mascara, with big fake lashes. I have WHORE written across my face, with my mouth as the O. ""Bimbofied to the max"" as Mistress Jasmine laughingly put it while she did my makeup. 

To my left is Wendy, and to her right is Layla, similarly bound, gagged and made up. 

In front of us is Mistress Jasmine Jamshidi in a grey ""power"" skirt suit, giving us the presentation on a large flat computer screen mounted on a desk. Our ""handlers"" sitting behind us, are Mistress Sandy for me, Mistress Nora for Wendy and Alpha Slave Sara for Layla. I am grateful that sadistic cunt Daci isn't here to mock and torment us. Though with this merchandising business, she'll have that much more fun at the Fetishcon as our Slave Handler.

We're going to be the ""Los Tres Bimbos De Plastica."" The Three Plastic Bimbos. Though Mistress Jasmine thought the Spanish was more catchy and would sell more merchandise. Beneath my shocked horror, Sheila the Chief Screenwriter has to agree.

The first thing she shows us is an AI generation of the full frontal cutout. We'll be standing, from left to right, Layla, me, and Wendy.  Nude, armbindered, and ungagged, made up like we are now. We're ungagged so we can pucker our puffed up lips while winking at the camera. In neon pink across the front of the cutout is printed ""LOS TRES BIMBOS DE PLASTICA!""
  
The back has us in the same lineup, Layla, me, Wendy. Our Team name is actually written  across our naked bums in black body marker. ""LOS TRES on Layla's butt. BIMBOS on my bum. DE PLASTICA!"" on Wendy's hind end. We each are to have our heads turned over our left shoulder in a sexy ""come hither"" look according to Jasmine. She tells us our Mistresses will very likely be liberal with their crops until we get it perfect for the shoots. She actually has the gall to giggle.

Then there are the stupid dolls. She shows us naked dolls with exaggerated lips, breasts and butts that will be sold at the Fetishcon resembling our augmented selves. A brown one for Layla. Lighter ones for Wendy and I, though the Asian slant of our eyes is exaggerated. The only accessories the dolls come with are bondage hoods, armbinders and other bondage gear. Possibly dolls of the dommes will be sold that are a lot more flattering and well dressed.



And the first one hundred dolls sold come with a free six pack of Bimbo Booster Energy Drinks! Sheila's Sultry Strawberry, Layla's Luscious Lime, and Wendy's Wicked Watermelon!  Each can has an image of the titular slave winking and a cartoon bubble coming out of her mouth saying ""Enjoy Baby! Mwah!""

And what slut (Or her Mistress or Master) could leave without buying some wonderful Tres Bimbos Cosmetic Products? For example Bimbo Lip Gloss! Layla's Lasivious Lavender, Sheila's Slutty Scarlet, and Wendy's Whorish White Lilac. Sure, Doll yourself up as your favorite Bimbo, or mix and match with all three!

Or how about some specialized Bondage gear? Layla's Latex Hood, anyone? Or Sheila's Sleepsack if you want to swaddle your slave? Or punish your slave with Wendy's Whip! Each piece gear stamped with the cartoonish image of the applicable slave licking her lips and  saying in a cartoon balloon: ""Punish...me......bab-beee....""

As a bonus, you could get Layla gear in camo as a ""homage"" to her Marine background. Jasmine was also planning on a humiliating Web Comic called ""Slave Border Bunny, Ex-Marine and Tactical Whore"" about Layla going on covert bondage missions overseen by her handler ""Princess Jasmine"". Her faithful side kicks Slaves Head and DASS would make guest appearances to aid her missions. This Persian bitch was pulling out all the stops to humiliate us. Though again, my analytical writer's  mind  saw story possibilities for the comic, and is interested in how the story seems to mirror our Op against Ari.

Then there is the ""Los Tres Bimbos De Plastica"" website and blog. For a fee you could download an app for a personalized AI ""Girlfriend""  modeled on one of the three of us. (For you big spenders, the deluxe package gets you all three of us, plus Princess Jasmine and Enforcer Nora!)

Your AI slave girl came with three free pieces of bondage gear (Purchase more at the online store!) and her own custom environment. You got free tokens to buy her gifts, makeup, accessories or punishments the more you played. What of the custom environments, you ask?

The kind of degrading crap I 'd expect from Ari. My environment was a Bamboo cage in a jungle, my Avatar wears a conical coolie hat and fans herself with a Vietnamese fan, totally nude. Layla's Environment is a Mexican Strip club that very obviously doubles as a whorehouse. Layla is on stage nude, except for a Sombrero and a rebozo, a Mexican lady's shawl. her introductory line is ""Can I dance for you baby?"" or ""¿Puedo bailar para ti bebe?""

(Did I forget to mention you can program your AI girl to speak in her ""native"" language? With subtitles! Mine was, ""Hi, baby! Me sucky sucky, me love you long time! Me give good boom boom!"" or ""Xin chào, em yêu! Anh hút anh hút, anh yêu em lâu lắm rồi! Anh cho em một tiếng nổ lớn!"" While fanning my naked simulated body with that stupid pink fan)

Wendy's AI is nude in the Karaoke room of a Korean Hostess bar. She wears a traditional Korean ladies Ayam hat and nothing else. An Ayam is actually more of a headband with a long flap in back covering the hair. She's sprawled on her right side with a salicious leer. Her introductory line is ""Can I blow on your mike, baby? My pussy is wet!"" or ""jagiya, maikeue bulmyeon an doelkka? nae bojiga jeoj-eoss-eo!"" Then she winks and fingers herself.



I look around at my fellow slaves. Wendy's eyes are watery, leaving streaks in her makeup I know Jasmine is going to bitch about fixing. Layla just looks outraged, like she's ready to break her bonds and start beating the shit out of the oblivious ""Marketing Mistress"". She's not even seeing the racism and internalized misogyny of fetishizing three fellow minority girls' cultural heritage. I know Ari has her hand in this. This reeks of her.

I look at the dommes, they've been giving us a lot more leeway and leniency today, probably because they know how much this sucks for all three of us.

Sandy's jaw is clenched tight, she catches my eye, nods, and tersely says ""I know."" 
The trope of the ""Full Metal Jacket"" girl isn't lost on my also half-Vietnamese younger sister. Not to mention the insulting ""Jungle Asian"" stereotype. She was Ari's slave, too, without words we both agree on who's responsible...for this crap.

Sarah's jaw is clenched, glaring at the cruel Korean woman stereotype on the screen. We fetishized her Korean ethnicity some, probably too much, during the first season of Perseverance. But as we grew from co-workers to family, part of the development of the show was having her character's growth overshadow past stereotypes. Now Ari is dredging them up again to humiliate another Korean woman.

As Jasmine yammers on about Temporary Tattoos, autographed photo shoots, Screensavers and other merchandising plans, Nora is looking around nervously. Like she realizes she's the only fully European ancestery white girl in the room, if you discount Sandy and I's half Irish Heritage. And Layla's likely mixed Spanish ancestory. Three are tied up, one is oblivious, but she's still outnumbered two to one. Jasmine keeps babbling.

Then she abruptly stops, looking at the specs for her ""Princess Jasmine Avatar"". ""Optional Chador for your Princess Jasmine!"" An aggrieved ""What the fuck! I told Ari and Daci I didn't even want my Avatar to wear a head covering!"" Layla and I look at each other, smiling around our ball gags, even Wendy's waterworks seem to have dried up.

Sandy, Nora and Sarah are cracking up. ""Hey, Princess"" Sandy says mockingly ""You didn't know Ari and Daci are kind of racist bitches through this whole presentation, until now?"" Nora holds up a hand, giggling ""Go easy on Jas girls, I think this is her first clue."" Sandy, Nora and Sarah go back to laughing.

Jasmine throws them an angry glare, then turns back to reading her specs. ""We're looking at future options for a submissive Persian Harem girl based on Jasmine Jamshidi's AI Avatar-Oh, hell no! No! Those two white bitches! I'm not going to participate in....that!""

""Jasmine."" Now Sandy sounds serious, and it gets Jasmine's attention. ""Make sure you tell Katie, you don't consent to the Chador, or even your image being used as a submissive. Whatever you do, don't let Ari or Daci talk you into ""trying something out in private, for the slaves."" Come find one of us and tell us, immediately. We'll talk more later."" Sandy and I exchange a look, we both have first hand experience with Ari tricking women into being ""submissives"", and manufacturing ""consent"", later. Even this clueless Persian girl doesn't deserve that.

Jasmine looks puzzled, and a little nervous, like she's just starting to realize she's playing a more dangerous game than she ever imagined. She continues the presentation more subdued than before. Text comes up on the screen, with pictures.

Our bios on the blog. First up is of course ""Marketing Mistress Jasmine Jamshidi"" with a picture of her in a high school cheerleaders uniform.

Mistress Jasmine is a native of Michigan, a third generation Iranian-Americana. Head Cheer Leader in high school, she went on to do four semesters of Business Administration before deciding to be a full time domme for Mistress Katie's Fetish Entertainment and Productions. Her most recent gig is Ensign Fatima Abdullah on the hit fetish show, the Perseverance. Asked how she feels about being the Marketing Mistress for three former dommes and older industry veterans, she had this to say:

""Well, I went in knowing it was going to be a challenge, though I've worked with Sheila and Layla before as slaves, they're very obedient and professional. Still, I expect some pushback from three former dommes on some of my ideas, despite them wanting to explore their submissive sides. The key is establishing a framework of trust and consent, where I can market them as the best Bimbos they can be, without pushing their hard limits. It's going to be a challenge but I'm up for it."" If ""Los Tres Bimbos De Plastica"" is a marketing success, Jasmine plans to go back to school for a Masters in Business Administration.

""Trust and consent!"" and ""Not pushing past hard limits!"" What hogwash! My bio is next.

My picture is me in my Fedora hat, Armani blouse, and ""Boss Bitch"" coffee cup from my time as Chief Screenwriter on the Perseverance. I also had my reading glasses perched on my nose.

Sheila Nguyen Connor entered the fetish world with a splash as Slave Loser Girl on Sheila's Slave Blog. She was lauded for being a groundbreaking player in the ""New Era Of Porn."" After she left Sheila's Slaveblog, she continued her success as Chief Screenwriter and Top Domme for the first three seasons of the hit fetish show Perseverance. Her current role is Slave Head, one of the Mascots for the Slave Gagger Girls series.

Sheila assesses her career and current role. ""I started as a submissive, got to pursue my dream of writing, as a bonus being Top Domme. I just felt I needed to go back to my submissive roots for awhile. I'm no stranger to public porn performances, but this gig looks tougher then Sheila's Slave Blog. Still with my right hand woman Layla at my side, my sister and my other girls supporting me, I can do this. I look forward to working for Mistress Ari again, and with Mistress Jasmine and Slave Wendy to make ""Los Tres Plastic Bimbos"" a success."" Sheila is currently the submissive of legendary porn star, Lara Gupta. Lara is the current Chief Screenwriter and Executive Domme on the Perseverance set.

More lies, I never said any of that!

Layla is next. The picture is her in her Marine ""Class A uniform"" probably from boot camp.

Layla Vasquez is a Sixth Generation Mexican American and grew up in Leaky, Texas. She joined the Marine Corps out of High School to ""See the world and serve my country."" After the Marines she worked odd jobs until she got selected in an audition for the role of Gunnery Sergeant Gabrielle ""Gabby"" Perez at the tail end of the First Season of The Perseverance. She was also Executive Domme over the three submissive regular cast members, Nora Jameson, Sarah Ok Kim and Mary Williamson.

Her most recent gig is ""Slave Border Bunny"" one of the Mascots of the Slavegagger Girls series. Of her decision to be a hard-core submissive after being a leader in the Fetish industry, Layla says ""I loved being a domme and giving orders. But just like with boot camp, I had to know if I could hack it, make the cut as a submissive. Slavegaggers is hard, ""Los Tres Bimbos De Plastica is epic difficulty. But I'm an ex-Marine, you can take me at my word I'll be the best Plastic Bimbo I can for you, Masters and Mistresses."" Layla is currently the submissive of former pro dominatrix, Constance Anderson. Miss Anderson is also the current Top Domme on the Perseverance set.

One look at Layla's stony face and I knew her statements were made up, too. A glance at Nora shows her looking a little guilty. The bios are a reminder that we used to be not just her bosses, but her mentors, when Mary neglected the role. After this past weeks brutality to us, she needs a reminder. Or she may lose us as friends, as well.

Wendy's bio is next. Her picture is in fetish gear. Peaked cap, black silver studded top, and two hand grip on a riding crop were all in view. She had a pleasant little smile, though something is wrong with her eyes. Her gaze seems almost as predatory as Ari's or Daci's.

Wendy Chang was kicked out of her strict Korean household for her wild ways and lack of interest in academics, despite testing for a high IQ at a very young age. She's supported herself as a sex worker for most of her adult life. From ""Streetwalker, low end dungeon dominatrix, to mid tier escort agencies"" by her own admission. She settled down for awhile, enrolled in community college and worked part time at a hardware star.

""Something just felt missing."" Wendy says of that time. So she partnered with her childhood friend Christopher Cho as a Dom/Domme team. Introduced as a Domme in Slavegaggers 4, she was reintroduced in Slavegaggers 5. As Slave DASS (Dumb Ass Slope Slut) as the Slavegagger series mascot.

Of her decision to do Slavegaggers and Tres Bimbos, Wendy says: I don't want to minimize how much women can suffer as  prostitutes, as a former prostitute myself. But sometimes, it's so ""liberating"" for my female sexuality to be an objectified whore. It sounds absurd and hard to explain if you haven't experienced it. But I wanted to explore those feelings again, in the safe space provided by Mistress Ari. The Tres Bimbos projects seems ambitious, especially with a novice domme in charge of marketing us. Still, she has a team of more experienced dommes to help her. And with two fetish Industry giants as my fellow submissives, Slaves Head and Border Bunny, I feel there's nothing standing in the away of the three of us becoming legends in the New Era of porn. We'll make Linda Lovelace look like a historical footnote!"" She giggles. Wendy is currently owned by Master Christopher Cho, a Dom and male actor in the Slavegagger series.

Wendy starts to sob, Jasmine looks irritated and reaches for a crop on the desk. Nora says ""I'll handle it, Jas."" Nora pulls her chair around to face the Korean girl. She actually gently dries her tears. ""Shhh, sweetie, shhhh.""

When Wendy stops sobbing, Nora puts away the hanky, and puts both hands on her shoulders. ""Look at me, honey."" Wendy pensively looks at the younger girl. ""You aren't alone in this, we're all here to help you. Sarah, Sandy, Jas and I aren't just your dommes, we're kind of like your coaches, too. We're here to help and support you. Isn't that right, girls?""

Sandy's pipes up ""That's right, Wendy. We can't make this a success unless we take care of you girls."" Sarah says ""I had my Korean heritage fetishized for the first season of the Perseverance, and I hated it, but I did my job, with the support of my friends."" She pauses to smile fondly around at Nora, Layla, and I. ""Take it day by day sweetie, we'll help you.""

Jasmine just folds her arms and looks exasperated. Sandy glares at her pointedly. I know Sandy hates the Persian girl for picking on Nora's nerdy hobbies like SCI-FI and roleplaying games. At the same time trying to mold Nora into more of a shallow ""popular"" girl, like herself. Jasmine tries to glare back, but she knows my tomboy sister could deck her with one punch, just like she did Cindy.

Jasmine unfolds her arms. ""Yeah, I guess."" Long moment of awkward silence. Then she speaks up sounding more sincere. ""We know this puts a lot on you girls, and Wendy realize it's difficult making yourselves so vulnerable for a profit margin. We're all women here, we'll give you girls opportunity to break character and relax. I really want to see how my ideas play out in the market, but I'll give you girls some input, you're not just sexual commodities, not to anyone in here.""

I think everyone else in the room looks truly amazed. I had a theory Jasmine was hiding a decent person in there deep down, though the less evidence I saw, the more I doubted that. Now I had a glimmer of hope Jasmine is actually not a lost cause.

Jasmine sighs. ""Ungag your girls, and hydrate them. Then I'll touch up their makeup. Little Miss Teary Eyes is going to put us behind at least a few minutes."" Wendy looks terrified. Another long sigh from Jasmine. ""Don't be afraid, sweetie. I'm not mad."" She doesn't sound convincing, but the fact she tries to reassure Wendy shows growth.

Nora says ""Jas, I'll fix her makeup. In fact, dommes, we can fix the girl's makeup ourselves, as Jas said, we're all women here. You set up for the shoot, Jas, while we see to the girls.""

Sandy ungags me and grabs some cosmetics from the table. Nora and Sara follow suit as Jas goes to check lighting and camera angles for our ""Los Tres Bimbos De Plastica"" promotional shoot.

As Sandy touches up my makeup, I reflect on Nora. She effortlessly showed patience, kindness and decisive leadership. This is the potential I saw in that shy girl back when I first set foot on the Perseverance set years ago. She may come out of this as a really excellent, but fair and ethical domme instead of an Ari clone. I'm still happy she has the support group of Sandy, Sarah, and Logan on site, she needs them to help her remember what's important. I hope they're enough.

Then I get both my dogs out to pee.

Then we go to a quiet local park where I spend a few hours in the car drinking coffee, having car food breakfast muffins and my dogs get their sausages and kibble. I watch a few shows on my phone. 

More walks.

At noon I dash lunch until around 2 and then it's my main meal of the day which I buy out. Protein of some origin, maybe a salad. Under $10

It's eaten at a shady location and my dogs get their treats and walks.

After this we may take a ride to a dog park for them to run Then back to a park to hang out where I read and we walk some again.

I may stop at my storage locker to swap out clothes or tidy up the trunk. I stock up snacks and try to keep things organized. This may involve a trip to the Dollar Tree or local grocery.

I may take a drive to a favorite area like along the river or to visit a friend or just to take a nap in our shady park.

By the time 5 or 6p comes I am readying to go do supper dash until around 8 or 9pm.

After that then I go back to one of 2 favorite evening hangouts where I sit with coffee and watch a few shows on my phone or talk to a few friends on the phone.

By 11pm I am positioned at the location where I and the dogs sleep for the night.

I now have an invite to shower and do laundry and hang out for a meal at a friend's house every Saturday. This is a huge plus for me. Huge.

I lived there for 5 weeks before the property management company asked me to leave.

I am waiting for my previous apartment to be repaired after early storm damage in early April.
Progress is really slow.

So this is my basic day living out of my car. Slow and easy and yet sometimes lonely and isolating.

What is your typical day like?

1l0ynva,https://www.reddit.com/r/productreview/comments/1l0ynva/switched_from_galaxy_buds_to_beats_studio_budswas/,Switched from Galaxy Buds to Beats Studio Buds—Was It a Mistake?,"Picked up the Beats Studio Buds last week after my Galaxy Buds 2 started dying way too fast. I was drawn to the Beats mainly because of the clean look and how they matched my iPhone better. Setup was smooth, and the fit was surprisingly good, didn’t expect them to feel that snug without wing tips.

Sound quality is solid, especially for bass-heavy tracks, but I noticed vocals sometimes get a little muddy. The ANC is okay, not as good as AirPods Pro or Sony, but enough to drown out background noise at a coffee shop. One weird thing, though: the touch controls feel laggy at times. Also had a couple random connection drops on my MacBook, which never happened with my Galaxy Buds.

Battery life has been alright, not amazing. They’re decent overall, but for the price I kinda expected smoother performance across devices. Curious if other people here felt the same or if I just got unlucky with my pair.",1,1748808895.0,productreview,0,1.0,False

However, they’ve not worked out how to accept tips on card. I’ve asked them about this and they’ve basically just snapped back that it’s not a priority. Like… um… it’s a priority for the rest of the minimum wage staff! We’re uk based so we’re not talking massive amounts of money but it’s a fair few quid at the end of the week and the customers genuinely want to tip. How do I approach this again? I actively dislike this person for various reasons including their awful interpersonal skills and constant moaning and feeling sorry for themselves but I think I hide it well. Like, they won’t allow me to show them how to make a decent latte because they think I’m putting them down. Like no! I just want to send out consistently good coffees and I can show you how.

I believe it’s from a recent (2020-2025) male artist, like Benson, Joshua Basset, Daniel Seavey vibes. I probably heard it on TikTok. I’m Spanish, the song is in English so the lyrics might not be 100% accurate:

Paralyzed/Petrified
I think about it all the time/every night
I hope that you can change your mind/I’m on a roller coaster ride
I don’t wanna say goodbye
I don’t wanna hurt you
Never felt so [good] in my life
