1mqey0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1mqey0m/cannot_tell_if_im_really_bipolar_and_struggling/,Cannot tell if I‚Äôm really bipolar and struggling on lamictal,"I was diagnosed with bipolar in 2017 after checking ‚Äúyes‚Äù to racing thoughts on a questionnaire at a psychiatrist office, but honestly, at the time those racing thoughts mostly happened after coffee or past amphetamine use. I struggled with depression on and off all throughout my 20s and I‚Äôd just gone through a stressful breakup before the diagnosis. The doc started Lamictal, but I didn‚Äôt like how I felt after a few weeks, and stopped it and didn‚Äôt go back to that doc. I didn‚Äôt truly believe I was bipolar then and just thought I was depressed and reeling from the breakup. 

I did have a hypomanic episode after starting pristiq in 2020, right after a different breakup, was partying a ton, and then got off the meds and went into depression once covid hit. The worst thing I did during that questionable hypomanic phase was getting discounted microblading. Still regret that. 

Fast forward to this year, I had been dating a guy for 8 months, we got engaged really fast and I was going through the motions thinking it was what I wanted. I had never been engaged before and I‚Äôm in my 30s. In April I realized out of the blue that I didn‚Äôt want to be with this guy and called off the engagement and wedding very suddenly. My fianc√© was a good guy, but I never truly felt in love and there were things about him I didn‚Äôt like. I also had just had hip surgery, was running my own business, and was under a lot of stress. I broke up with him, immediately regretted it a couple days later thinking I wouldn‚Äôt find anyone better in my 30s and blamed it on being bipolar, and got back together with him.

I gave Lamictal another chance after that as I tried to repair the relationship and see if things could work. He liked how I was on it and said I needed it ‚Äî probably because I gave him more attention ‚Äî but in reality, I was just trying harder in the relationship to give him more attention and have a better work life balance in business. But three months later (July) I realized I really do not like the guy and broke things off once and for all. Between April and July I titrated up to 200mg lamictal daily. 

Now, a month later, I‚Äôm questioning everything:
	‚Ä¢	Was I ever bipolar?
	‚Ä¢	Is Lamictal actually helping me?
Because while my mind is calmer, I feel extremely flat, can‚Äôt force myself to smile, have word-finding and memory issues, and get no joy from things I used to love. I‚Äôm a content creator and business owner and it‚Äôs very hard to deal with some of these side effects. 

I‚Äôm also just wondering in general if my breakup response was normal or was this really cause to start lamictal. 

Has anyone else experienced anything like this on Lamictal? How did you know if it was helping or just numbing you?

PS- I feel so dumb on lamictal that I can‚Äôt even get this story out in a succinct way that makes sense. I had to have AI help me write it. ",1,1755209350.0,bipolar,1,1.0,False

(Resuable containers in the nest, that replaced all single use cups/containers)","A couple days ago, AMS food outlets in the nest and both hero/harvest on campus switched to friendlier. Bluechip no longer offers the single use paper cups for your coffee and you need to pay a $0.85 deposit every time you buy something that uses these containers. 
After use, you need to place the container back in the nest in one of these bins and they ll process it within 2 weeks to get your refund back to you. Since it‚Äôs new, I am not sure how the refund works yet (it says e-transfer by email). 
I wanted to know everyone‚Äôs opinion on it- is it actually sustainable or just inconvenient? 

My thoughts on it - the material of the containers actually look to be plastic too, similar to Tupperware and personally you were already recycling paper coffee cups so how would this make a difference? 
Also to process the refund, you need to download their app to scan the container and make your account ( your data is collected- negative for me ). 
So the way out is get your own tumbler?

1mqeud7,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1mqeud7/i_27m_have_a_crush_on_my_gay_friend_23f_of_three/,I (27M) have a crush on my gay friend (23F) of three years,"I (27M) met Jane (23F) in 2022 at an event but we were both in relationships at the time. We stayed in touch for the following years on social media until January of this year, where we reconnected in-person after both becoming single. It started simply by meeting at different coffee shops once every few weeks - my intent was a platonic friendship but I couldn‚Äôt help but notice how long we‚Äôd stay talking, often 2-3 hours at a time. 

A couple months in, I mentioned an event I was going to that she expressed interest in where we‚Äôd stay ~4 days. I offered to split a hotel with her if she was comfortable and she agreed. Fast forward to May, I meet her there and we had an absolute blast together. It was on that trip that I realized this might be more than a platonic relationship, at least for me. Although nothing physical had happened, I couldn‚Äôt help but notice how easy our friendship was and how well we communicated & worked together. After that trip, we started talking every day - as meaningless as it sounds, we‚Äôd send each-other pictures of sunsets, she‚Äôd send me photos of her cats, funny Reels, TikToks and so on. We have a lot in common and always have stuff to talk about. We met about once a week for dinner which, again, was easy, peaceful & fun. 

Last week, we took another trip to an event where we stayed together for 5 days. Again, we had a wonderful time but throughout this trip, I had been pulled aside by friends asking if Jane & I were a couple - admittedly, the way we interact & amount of time spent together made it look that way. Jane & I shared a room and would stay up every night until 1-2AM talking, picking-on each-other, telling stories, etc. We had a few bonding ‚Äúmoments‚Äù on this trip that really stuck out to me. Our chemistry seems undeniable but here‚Äôs where it gets tricky‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve completely ignored the elephant in the room. She isn‚Äôt one to ‚Äòmake a move‚Äô or even talk about it openly; this is something she‚Äôs notably reserved about. I haven‚Äôt made it super clear how I feel, which isn‚Äôt helping anything. I‚Äôve talked to a couple of her friends about the situation but they‚Äôre just as ‚Äòin the dark.‚Äô She doesn‚Äôt make flirty remarks but her actions and care around me make me wonder‚Ä¶ I just hope I‚Äôm not misreading.

To make things more ambiguous, she‚Äôs mentioned being gay more than once, which, of course, I respect. She‚Äôs never been with another girl that I know of and isn‚Äôt actively pursuing one. Her last relationship was anything but ‚Äúgreat‚Äù and I‚Äôm worried she‚Äôs written-off men as a whole (based on comments she‚Äôs made). Our friendship has become very special to me but I‚Äôm horribly afraid of damaging things by telling her how I feel. I understand that I can‚Äôt let this drag on forever, I just want to know where I stand. Should I tell her how I feel or wait for a clearer signal from her? 

TL; DR - A friend (23F) & I (27M) reconnected after a few years but I quickly picked-up on our chemistry, which has turned into a crush. She‚Äôs gay but has only been with guys and none of which were good for her. We‚Äôve been on two trips together, shared rooms but have barely hugged. So far we‚Äôve completely ignored our situation and haven‚Äôt talked about it one bit - I‚Äôm scared that I‚Äôm misreading a friendship.",0,1755209118.0,relationships,2,0.33,False
1mqerty,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1mqerty/no_sleep_took_this_story_down_for_being_too/,"No Sleep took this story down for being ""too comedic""","Sleep is beautiful. It's our break from the world. Peace. A slide into the valley of the Lotus Eaters. I look forward to sleeping at night. You might say it's my favorite hobby, which is funny, considering it's so hard for me to do. 
  

  
I don't sleep well. I blame the neighborhood I live in. The unearthly squawks that echo across the lake are a part of the issue. Everyone says it's a heron, and that's exactly what the squawker wants them to think. The packs of inbred, feral cats aren't exactly quiet. The interbreeding is so extreme that they're de-evolving. At least I think that's what's happening. I saw one the other day that didn't even have a face. My neighbor Dan likes to start up his front loader at 3 am and dig holes, then fill them up again before the sun rises. He's a good guy.
  

  
I lay awake, staring at the faint light shining on the Bluetooth speaker. I covered the light with a shirt, but it only dimmed it. My girlfriend was asleep next to me, humming softly and speaking a language that no human has heard for several thousand years. We played rain over the speaker to drown out the noise from outside, but it wasn't loud enough to mask the ancient spell she was weaving in my ear. 
  

  
Something distant niggled at me. I reached over and turned the stormy ambiance down four notches. I scooted my head away from Vandie‚Äôs sibilant mutterings and listened. The sound picked up again, a rattling coming from the kitchen. No, the door to the carport. 
  

  
In the light of my phone screen, I could see glowing green eyes staring at me‚Äìthat's the extraterrestrial noodle that sleeps on my floor at night. Otherwise known as our German Shepherd, Bert. Sometimes I swear she stands over me on two legs while I'm sleeping. She turned her head towards the sound as it grew louder, satellite-sized ears standing straight up. 
  

  
‚ÄúShiiiiiit,‚Äù I hissed. 
  

  
There were several things it could be. The philanthropist that crawls out of the lake to reorganize our storage shed, leaving a cyan slime trail as a receipt. A learning-disabled cat, thinking it had finally caught something to eat. That naked guy that pops up sometimes, repeating the made-up word, ‚Äúwillahsam,‚Äù over and over again. Oh, yeah. I forgot to mention one of the scariest things about the neighborhood: the tweakers. 
  

  
‚ÄúFuuuuck,‚Äù I wiped my eyes and swung my legs over the edge of the bed. 
  

  
‚ÄúD≈ì√ß√´ √ß√¥m√´k v√¶k √±√¢la?‚Äù Vandie asked. 
  

  
‚ÄúYeah, it's okay go back to sleep.‚Äù
  

  
‚ÄúGood. I love you.‚Äù
  

  
I could see the glowing night sights of my CZ 9mm from the half-open drawer next to me. I unsnapped it from the holster. I listened hard. Sprouck, our old pitbull was awake now. He finally heard the sound and gave a half-assed bark, like he hated his only job. 
  

  
‚ÄúThanks, bud,‚Äù I whispered. 
  

  
The rattling stopped, replaced by another sound. A clicking. That was the door opening. A muffled bang. The doorknob bouncing off of the pantry cabinet. Oh my fuck, it's inside. The storm door hissed closed. Irregular footsteps sounded on the creaky kitchen floor. It sounded like something crippled, a twisted, pitiful thing. Then there was another sound, a groaning. Pain. Misery. Regret. Rage. Hunger?
  

  
I stood and paced quietly to our bedroom door. The dogs followed behind me, Sprouck growling low, Bert staring at the door, laser-focused. I pressed my phone hard against my stomach and flicked on the flashlight. I cracked the door. The dogs tried to rush the breach but I blocked the crack with my legs. 
  

  
A putrid smell hit me in the face like a commandeered street sign wielded by an unhinged meth head. It was a rotten, sweet reek like vomit and old mud. Lake mud. I held my breath and flung the door open. Bert and Sprouck darted out. The groaning intensified as the dogs set on the thing, their claws clacking on the tile in the tussle. I pointed my light and saw a mass of limbs and fur on the floor. I closed the door behind me and made for the light switch. 
  
 
  
I kept the 9 pointed down while I rushed away from the fight. I flipped the switch and the lights came on. Momentarily blind, I backpedaled away from the fight. The living room coffee table slammed into the back of my knees, and I almost went over on my ass. I covered my eyes as they adjusted. That's when I saw the thing. 
  

  
It was unthinkably awful. A horror that resonates on the deepest levels of the subconscious. It was‚Ä¶ oh my god. 
  

  
It was my neighbor, Burke. 
  

  
‚ÄúHey man,‚Äù he said from the floor. He was petting the excited pups with one hand and holding a whiskey bottle up with the other. A trail of thick mud tracks trailed from the door. ‚ÄúI hurt my hand picking your lock.‚Äù
  

  
‚ÄúHey man,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou should be more careful, I could have shot you.‚Äù 
  

  
‚ÄúYou weren't answering my texts,‚Äù he slurred. He got to his feet, hugging me. I held my breath to avoid the stench. 
  

  
I checked my phone. ‚ÄúYou haven't texted me.‚Äù
  

  
‚ÄúYeah I did,‚Äù he looked down at his phone and began to read, hiccupping. ‚ÄúI said ‚ÄòHey, wake--‚Äô hicuh ‚Äò--the fuck up or I'm going to send everyone that picture from the Christmas Party, the one where you got so fucked up you puked on that guy in thewheelchair because you thought he was a--‚Äô hicuuuuh‚Äò--a toilet.‚Äô‚Äù 
  

  
I looked at my phone again. ‚ÄúNah man, I didn't get it.‚Äù
  

  
‚ÄúWait, oh,‚Äù he said. ‚Äú...‚ÄôMax Boss‚Äô‚Ä¶ Not ‚ÄòMax Ross.‚Äô I really gotta change that, that's the third time this week.‚Äù
  

  
I set the gun down on the counter. Burke was so drunk he was doing ""the zombie."" The guy is an inhuman freak, he was in gymnastics from infancy and he was preposterously athletic. He‚Äôs been doing nothing but drink and smoke for years and he's still ripped. At the moment he was black out drunk but his balance was so good that he just swung around at the waist like his feet were planted in concrete. I called it ""the zombie,"" but only because ""wacky waving inflatable arm tube man"" is too long. 
  

  
Burke had bright red hair and one good eye. The other eye was gray and dead. His brother had been casting a fishing line and caught him on the backswing with the weight when they were kids. He said he couldn't move it but it turned to peer at me when he was looking in another direction sometimes. 
  

  
‚ÄúWhy are you muddy?‚Äù
  

  
‚ÄúI went for a walk,‚Äù he said. 
  

  
‚ÄúIn the lake?‚Äù 
  

  
‚ÄúMhmmm. Come on, you gotta see this. Hold on, can I grab some chips?‚Äù
  

  
I knew those groans meant ""hungry.""
  

  
He turned around and shuffled toward the door, bottle swinging in his hand, chips in the other. I let the door close softly behind me. We were immediately assaulted by a swarm of hummingbird-sized mosquitoes. I grabbed the Off! sitting on the step and blasted myself. I sprayed some into the swarm for good measure. Not like it mattered, I think they just get high off the stuff at this point. 
  

  
We walked out under the stars and I yawned. Burke lit up a cigarette and held the bottle out toward me. I waved it away. He ate the chips, smoked his cigarette, and drank as we walked. 
  

  
‚ÄúWhere are we going? I have work tomorrow, Burke.‚Äù
  

  
‚ÄúI know. You're going to want to see this, trust me.‚Äù
  

  
We walked around to his backyard, which was surprisingly tasteful and well-constructed. It looked like the big reveal at the end of those renovation shows that moms watch. We stepped into the pea gravel border that surrounded the stone fire pit.  
  

  
‚ÄúLook,‚Äù he said. He pointed up at the sky. 
  

  
‚ÄúAw fuck man. You drug me out here to look at a star?‚Äù 
  

  
‚ÄúWatch,‚Äù he said. 
  

  
I sighed, complying. Several seconds passed. It slowly hovered left, then right, zig-zagging as it descended. It wasn't a star. It was floating in front of an oak tree, the size of an orange. 
  

  
‚ÄúWhat the fuck is that?‚Äù
  

  
He took a swig. ‚ÄúTinkerbell?‚Äù
  

  
I watched it glide toward me. It was coming straight at my face. I bobbed backward, but it stopped inches away. It reversed several feet in a straight line, then stopped and returned. It did the same thing to Burke. 
  

  
‚ÄúI think it wants us to follow it, Max,‚Äù Burke said. 
  

  
‚ÄúWhy would we do that?‚Äù
  

  
‚ÄúBecause I picked your lock and dragged you out here at 3:00 a.m., and I know you--huuc--wouldn't make me go through all that for nothing.‚Äù
  

  
""Yeah, sorry to inconvenience you, man.""
  

  
""It's alright. Let's go,"" he said, strolling away. 
  

  
We followed. It bounced along through the air,  leading us across the road and through the empty lot where the Fish Cult has its bonfires on Saturday nights. The burned bacon smell always lingers for half the week. We passed into the yard of an abandoned house Dan had bought, he'd turned it into some kind of shed where he stored big black trash bags. I swatted at a mosquito and Burke took another pull from his bottle. 
  

  
He burped, turning the belch into the word ‚Äúbitch,‚Äù one of his more endearing habits. ‚ÄúMaybe it's a Lassie situation,‚Äù he said. 
  

  
‚ÄúOr maybe it's a Pennywise situation.‚Äù
  

  
‚ÄúNever--hiccuuh‚Äìlistened to them,‚Äù Burke slurred. 
  

  
‚ÄúWhat? No, not the ba‚Äì‚Äù 
  

  
‚ÄúShhhh,‚Äù he interrupted, trying to put an index finger on my mouth. I pushed it away. Then I heard it, a choking sound like someone badly needed the Heimlich. 
  

  
The zesty orb bounced in the air, waiting. We crept along behind it. It led us around the corner of the abandoned house and zoomed steadily toward a willow tree. It stopped outside the curtain of stringy branches, backtracked a few feet, and then penetrated the canopy. I looked at Burke. He shrugged. 
  

  
We approached the tree, the choking sound growing louder. We parted the branches to enter, the hovering, radiant testicle illuminating the interior, casting hundreds of little shadows. It pulled away, towards the back side of the trunk and sank toward the ground. I could see one bare, hairy thigh protruding from around the tree. That thigh looked oddly familiar, somehow. 
  

  
The choking, gibbering, slobbery sound sent chills up my spine. 
  

  
‚ÄúAre you, uh, alright?‚Äù I asked the victim. 
  

  
The sound just continued. I felt Burke peeking over my shoulder. I edged carefully around the trunk. I could see the man's back now. It looked like he was rhythmically seizing, maybe‚Äì
  

  
I stopped. The man was completely naked. He removed his mouth from around the tree-dick and looked up at me. He pointed at the trunk with one hand, his other still on the base of the phallus. 
  

  
‚ÄúWillahSam,‚Äù he said in a thick southern accent. 
  

  
I blinked. I couldn't think of anything else to do but slowly back away. 
  

  
The willow branches began to shake, until they were vibrating rapidly. ‚ÄúThat's me,‚Äù the voice came from everywhere. ‚ÄúWe're always looking for guys who like to party.‚Äù
  

  
‚ÄúNah man,‚Äù Burke said, taking a drink of whiskey so big it glugged. ‚ÄúAhhhh, we don't party.‚Äù
  

  
The choking sound continued. ‚ÄúOkay, nice to meet you,‚Äù said Willow Sam. 
  

  
We exited the tree. The orb was waiting for us, shuddering. Like it was laughing, or shaking with fury. I didn't care which. 
  

  
We walked in silence, until Burke said, ‚ÄúWhat about splinters?‚Äù
  

  
‚ÄúDon't, man.‚Äù
  

  
We arrived at his driveway, and he stopped. I kept walking. 
  

  
He dragged on his cigarette, ‚Äúprobably not an issue, I bet that thing is silky smooth by now.‚Äù
  

  
I went home. I was going back to sleep. 
  

  
I entered the kitchen to find my mom pouring a glass of buttermilk. I almost gagged at the sight of it, then gagged at the reminder of the gagging I'd just been subjected to. She looked up. 
  

  
‚ÄúWhat were you doing out?‚Äù she asked. 
  

  
‚ÄúBurke wanted to show me something.‚Äù
  

  
‚ÄúWhat was it?‚Äù
  

  
‚ÄúYou don't wanna know.‚Äù
  

  
‚ÄúOh, was it Willow Sam?‚Äù 
  

  
‚ÄúWhat? How did you‚Äì
  

  
‚ÄúThat dirty old dog. I suppose I'm glad to know he's still partying. Goodnight,‚Äù she turned and walked away. She flipped the light switch and left me standing in darkness. 
  

  
‚ÄúWhat the fuck?‚Äù I muttered. 
  

  
I laid down next to Vandie, who was still murmuring like a tranquilized, half-tongued Russian. I laid there, staring at the light on the Bluetooth speaker.",1,1755208951.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

Creating a Balanced 1600 Calorie Meal Plan for Weight Loss
----------------------------------------------------------

When you're aiming for weight loss, having a structured meal plan is crucial. A 1600 calorie meal plan can effectively help you lose weight while ensuring you get the nutrients your body needs. Here‚Äôs how you can create a balanced plan that supports your weight loss goals.

To start, it's essential to include a variety of foods that provide essential nutrients. Aim to incorporate fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. This combination will help maintain your energy levels while keeping you satisfied throughout the day.

Here's a sample 1600 calorie meal plan to guide you:

- **Breakfast (400 calories):**
    - 1 serving of oatmeal made with water topped with a banana and a sprinkle of cinnamon.
    - 1 boiled egg for additional protein.
    - A cup of black coffee or herbal tea.
- **Snack (150 calories):**
    - 1 medium apple or pear.
    - 1 tablespoon of almond butter.
- **Lunch (450 calories):**
    - Grilled chicken salad made with mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, and a light vinaigrette dressing.
    - 1 whole grain roll on the side.
- **Snack (150 calories):**
    - 1 small container of Greek yogurt, unsweetened.
    - Drizzle of honey or a few berries for flavor.
- **Dinner (450 calories):**
    - 4 oz of baked salmon seasoned with herbs and lemon.
    - 1 cup of steamed broccoli.
    - ¬Ω cup of quinoa.

This meal plan covers all food groups while staying within your calorie limit. Each meal is designed to keep you full, preventing those pesky hunger pangs that often lead to snacking or overeating.

When creating your meal plan, remember to stay hydrated. Drinking plenty of water is essential, so aim for at least eight glasses a day. Sometimes thirst can masquerade as hunger, leading to unnecessary snacking.

As you follow your 1600 calorie meal plan, it‚Äôs important to listen to your body. Everyone‚Äôs needs are unique, so this plan can be adjusted based on your activity level and individual requirements. Consider increasing your calorie intake slightly if you find yourself feeling fatigued or excessively hungry.

Protein is especially important when on a calorie-restricted plan. It promotes satiety and helps maintain muscle mass. Incorporate lean proteins like chicken, turkey, fish, beans, and legumes into your meals. Aim for a protein source in each meal to enhance fullness.

Additionally, don‚Äôt shy away from healthy fats. Foods such as avocados, nuts, and olive oil can be incredibly satisfying and help improve the overall taste of your meals. Just remember to keep portion sizes in check, as fats are calorie-dense.

It's also helpful to include fiber-rich foods in your meal plan. High-fiber foods, like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, help keep you feeling full longer and support digestive health. These foods take longer to digest, which can stave off hunger between meals.

Flexibility is key with any meal plan. If you go out to eat or feel like switching things up, try to stick to similar nutritional values. For example, if you choose a dish that's higher in calories, balance it out by having lighter meals throughout the day.

Remember, the primary goal of a 1600 calorie meal plan for weight loss is not just to cut calories but to provide your body with a wholesome, balanced diet that fuels your fitness journey. Listen to your body's signals and adjust as necessary to ensure you're on the right path towards reaching your weight loss goals.

Tips for Staying Committed to Your Weight Loss Journey
------------------------------------------------------

Committing to a weight loss journey often feels like climbing a mountain. At times, the path can seem steep and challenging. However, with the right mindset and strategies, you can stay on track and reach your goals. Here are some effective tips to keep you engaged and motivated throughout your journey.

### Set Clear Goals

Start by defining your weight loss goals. Be specific about how much weight you want to lose and set a realistic timeline. Instead of saying, ‚ÄúI want to lose weight,‚Äù try, ‚ÄúI want to lose 10 pounds in three months.‚Äù Clearly defined goals provide you with a roadmap and a sense of direction.

### Track Your Progress

Keep a record of your weight loss journey. Use a journal, an app, or a spreadsheet. By logging your daily meals, workouts, and weight changes, you hold yourself accountable. Regular check-ins will reveal your progress and remind you of how far you‚Äôve come. Plus, seeing those incremental victories can boost your morale.

### Focus on Nutrition

Your diet plays a crucial role in weight loss. Consider planning your meals in advance and incorporating whole, nutrient-dense foods. Here are some great options:

- Fruits and vegetables
- Lean proteins, such as chicken, turkey, and fish
- Whole grains like quinoa and brown rice
- Healthy fats from avocados and nuts

By prioritizing these foods, you're less likely to reach for unhealthy snacks. Remember to stay hydrated as well; drinking plenty of water supports metabolism and helps in curbing appetite.

### Create a Support System

Having a support system is essential for maintaining motivation. Share your goals with friends and family members who can provide encouragement. You might also consider joining a weight loss group or connecting with online communities. Surrounding yourself with like-minded individuals makes the uphill climb feel less daunting.

### Establish a Routine

Consistency is vital in any weight loss journey. Establish a daily routine that includes time for exercise and meal prep. Consider scheduling workouts like appointments to ensure they don‚Äôt get overlooked. Having a structured routine helps you develop healthy habits and makes it easier to stay focused on your goals.

### Stay Flexible

It‚Äôs important to remain adaptable. Life can be unpredictable, and sometimes changes are unavoidable. If you miss a workout or indulge in an extra treat, don‚Äôt be too hard on yourself. Instead of seeing these moments as failures, consider them as opportunities to learn and refocus. Remember, perfect consistency is not the goal; your journey is about progress.

### Celebrate Every Victory

Every step forward is worth celebrating. Whether you've lost two pounds, completed a challenging workout, or cooked a healthy meal, take a moment to acknowledge your achievements. Treat yourself to non-food rewards like a new workout outfit or a relaxing spa day. Celebrating your successes reinforces positive behavior and fuels your motivation.

### Visualize Your Success

Visualization can be a powerful tool. Take a few minutes each day to picture yourself at your goal weight. Imagine how you will look and feel. Think about the activities you‚Äôll enjoy and the confidence you‚Äôll gain. This practice can help keep your motivation alive during tough times.

### Find Activities You Enjoy

Exercise doesn‚Äôt have to be a chore. Explore various activities to find what you genuinely enjoy. Whether it‚Äôs hiking, dancing, or yoga, engaging in fun activities makes it easier to stay active. If you love what you‚Äôre doing, you‚Äôre more likely to stick with it long-term.

### Educate Yourself

Understanding nutrition and fitness can empower your journey. Take time to read articles, follow reputable blogs, or watch videos that focus on weight loss. Learning about healthy eating patterns and effective exercise techniques can inspire you to make informed choices that align with your goals.

These tips into your weight loss journey can create a solid foundation for success. Staying committed involves more than just losing weight; it's about embracing a healthier lifestyle. With dedication, patience, and the right strategies in place, you can achieve your weight loss goals and maintain them for the long haul.

### Conclusion

Embarking on a weight loss journey can be challenging, but a well-structured 1600 calorie meal plan can make it easier and more effective. By prioritizing balanced nutrition, you ensure that your body receives the essential vitamins and minerals it needs while still working towards your weight loss goals. Ensuring your meals are rich in whole grains, lean proteins, fruits, and vegetables lays a strong foundation for success.

Staying committed to your weight loss journey is equally important. Set realistic goals and celebrate small victories along the way to keep your motivation high. Consider meal prepping to take the guesswork out of your daily choices, making it simpler to adhere to your plan. Surround yourself with a supportive network, whether it‚Äôs friends, family, or online communities that share similar goals.

Remember, weight loss is not just about the numbers on a scale; it's about establishing long-term healthy habits that enhance your overall well-being. Listen to your body, adjust your plans as needed, and don't hesitate to seek professional guidance if necessary. With dedication and the right strategies, you will find your path to achieving your weight loss goals. Embrace the journey, and watch as your efforts translate into lasting changes in both your health and lifestyle. The completion of this journey not only transforms your physical appearance but also empowers you to lead a more vibrant and fulfilling life.

As Professor Malvolia dismissed the class, a collective exhale rippled through the room. Students gathered their grimoires and scattered like bats at sunrise. Some were eager to distance themselves from what they'd witnessed, others whispering in anticipation about the next opportunity to experiment on a live human.

Mo remained rooted in place, her stomach still knotted, as Nyx hovered at her side. Their obsidian form hadn't settled since Julian's demonstration, rippling between solid and smoke like a reflection in troubled water.

""Coming?"" they asked, eyebrows drawn together in concern.

Mo shook her head, her gaze fixed on Julian as he organized his notes despite the occasional tremor still coursing through his hands. ""I'll catch up. There's something I need to do first.""

Nyx followed her line of sight, and their eyes widened with understanding. ""Want me to create a distraction?"" they whispered, leaning close enough that their shifting aura brushed cool against Mo's skin. ""I could accidentally‚Ä¶"" their fingers sparked with violet energy, crackling softly between syllables, ""‚Ä¶set the professor's desk on fire.""

""And by accidentally, you mean extremely deliberately,"" Lucian interjected, frost crystallizing around his collar.

Mo pushed them both gently toward the door. ""No, thanks. I'm afraid it will only be an additional burden for this poor chap. I've got this. Save me a seat at dinner?""

Only when they'd reluctantly departed did Mo approach Julian. ""Hi,"" she said, then immediately regretted the casual human greeting. Three years in a bookstore had rubbed off on her in ways that would horrify her aristocratic ancestors.

Julian looked up, mild surprise registering in his tired eyes. ""Hello."" His voice had lost the clinical tone from the demonstration, revealing something softer beneath.

""I'm Mo‚ÄîMorgana Nightshade."" She hesitated. ""Are you... okay?""

A small smile touched his lips. ""Relatively speaking. The Trembling Veil hex isn't among the worst."" He tapped his notebook. ""The effects will fade completely within an hour.""

""But why would you..."" Mo stopped herself. ""I mean, you're human.""

""I am aware,"" he replied, a hint of dry humor in his voice.

""And you voluntarily let them use you as a magical guinea pig?""

""The research has value. Humans who encounter hexes accidentally have no preparation, no understanding of what's happening to them. My work helps develop counter-hexes, treatments."" He spoke with practiced conviction, but Mo caught something else beneath his words‚Äîa careful evasion.

""That's the official answer,"" she said. ""What's the real one? And would the humans even benefit from that data? Are they getting access to it?""

Julian studied Mo's face, his expression shifting from polite distance to cautious assessment. ""You're not what I expected from a Nightshade,"" he finally said, neatly sidestepping her question.

Julian waited for a moment as if expecting Mo to leave. ""I was born in the human world, on Earth,"" he said after a pause. Julian leaned against the desk, wincing as another aftershock of the hex rippled through him. The confession seemed to hang in the air between them.

Mo stepped closer, accidentally kicking an empty vial across the floor. The glass clinked against the stone as her mind raced to make sense of the strange duality she'd sensed in him. ""Human with magic? But not...""

Julian flexed his trembling fingers, watching them as if they belonged to someone else. ""Not demonic, not fae,"" he said quietly, ""not anything but human with a few extra sparks in the blood."" When he looked up, his eyes momentarily reflected the light like a nocturnal animal's before returning to their ordinary brown. ""There are more of us than your people realize. Families who've known about the wider worlds for many generations. We exist in the footnotes of your histories.""

Mo felt a jolt of recognition. While she had fled from her demonic heritage to find refuge in humanity, here was someone born human who carried magic in his veins‚Äîmoving in the opposite direction but ending up in the same in-between space. She'd never considered that such people might exist, humans with just enough magic to be noticed but not enough to belong.

""How?"" Mo asked.

Julian's fingers idly traced a pattern on the desk's scarred surface. Mo recognized it instantly‚Äîa protection sigil, small but powerful. The wood grain seemed to shift beneath his touch, responding to this minor magic.

""Ancient pacts. Chance encounters."" He paused to clear his throat as the classroom's lights flickered overhead, casting shadows across his face. ""Cosmic accidents. My great-great-something-great-grandmother stumbled through a portal during a storm.""

He turned away to collect a fallen quill, his movements still unsteady. ""Came back changed, knowing things. It's not that we are hiding, really. It's that the demons like you don't usually spend any time thinking abut us. A footnote, as I said.""

A distant scream tore through the academy's corridors‚Äîhigh and inhuman, before dissolving into what might have been wild laughter. Mo flinched, her body still wired to respond to sounds of distress. Probably just some routine classwork, she reminded herself, but her heart hammered anyway.

Julian didn't even blink. The horrors of Umbra Academy seemingly had become his white noise a while ago.

""We're the in-betweens,"" he continued, his voice softening as he ran his thumb over a small scar on his wrist that looked suspiciously like a binding mark. ""Never fully part of the human world, never accepted in yours.""

The words struck Mo with unexpected force. She staggered back, nearly toppling a shelf of potion ingredients‚Äîcreatures and parts suspended in liquids that shifted as if still alive. For a moment, she couldn't breathe. Not because Julian had said anything shocking, but because he'd articulated the ache she'd carried for years: too demonic to truly belong on Earth, too steeped in humanity to fit within these twisted halls.

""My family is one of the few who maintain... diplomatic relations with the arcane realms. We serve as intermediaries, sometimes."" Julian's careful phrasing suggested layers of politics and history. ""It's why I'm allowed here, documenting what your magic does to human physiology. Knowledge is power.""

Mo studied him with a new understanding. ""You don't belong fully in either world.""

""It seems that you don't belong either,"" he replied, surprising her. ""I recognize the signs. The way you hesitate before using formal titles. Your discomfort during the demonstration. You've lived among humans recently.""

For the first time since arriving at Umbra Academy, Mo felt truly seen. All the camaraderie she experienced with Nyx and now Lucian... it was different.

""I managed a bookstore,"" Mo confessed, the words tumbling out before she could reconsider. ""For three years. In a small town where no one knew what I was. I started when I was sixteen. But with my powers‚Ä¶ it wasn't hard to persuade humans that I was a bit more‚Ä¶ mature. So, that's what I was doing, shelving novels, recommending romances to retirees, organizing an occasional poetry reading, and serving lattes.""

Julian's eyes brightened with genuine interest. ""A bookstore? With paperbacks and coffee and those little reading nooks?""

""Exactly that. Mismatched armchairs and a cat that knocked over the displays."" Mo smiled at the memory. ""Not very villainous.""

""Sounds wonderful."" There was honest longing in his voice. ""I haven't been to Earth since I was a child. My family keeps mostly to our compound now‚Äîsafer that way.""

""You miss it,"" Mo realized.

""How can I miss what I barely remember?"" Suddenly, Julian's tone was much more guarded, as if he had realized he had shared too much.

""I dream about my bookstore,"" Mo admitted, tracing a non-existant stain on the desk. ""It's been only a couple of days. But it feels like I've lost that life forever. Like I completely abandoned the person I'd worked so hard to become.""

They stood in silence for a moment, two people stranded between realities, recognizing in each other a shared displacement.

Julian looked away, waiting as if hesitating to spill too much. But then he shrugged and looked directly into Mo's eyes. ""Would you tell me about it sometime?"" he asked. His fingers instinctively touched his experiment logbook before pulling away as if catching himself in a habit. ""Your life there? The human world through the eyes of someone who chose it rather than being born to it?""

Mo tucked a strand of ginger hair behind her ear, her signet ring catching the light. ""Only if you'll tell me about your family,"" she countered. ""How you navigate being human with magical knowledge without getting crushed between worlds. Without ending up as someone's... research assistant.""

Their eyes met, and Mo felt something shift between them‚Äînot a magical connection, but something rarer: understanding.

""It's a deal,"" Julian said, offering his hand.

When their fingers touched, Mo felt a slight jolt‚Äînot the familiar surge of her succubus power seeking to ensnare, but something simpler, more human. Static electricity, perhaps. Or possibility. Behind them, a shadow shifted by the door‚Äîsomeone watching, listening. But in this moment of connection, Mo couldn't care less.

The academy bells tolled, their dissonant melody announcing the dinner hour. Mo withdrew her hand, suddenly aware of how long they'd been talking. ""I should go before Nyx organizes a search party.""

Julian nodded, slipping his notebook into his satchel. ""Until next time, Morgana Nightshade, barista extraordinaire.""

¬†

\*\*\*

¬†

Mo slammed her spellbook shut with enough force that Nyx's budding collection of stolen laboratory specimens rattled on their makeshift shelf. A jar of something with too many eyes blinked rapidly in protest.

The three of them had retreated to Mo and Nyx's dorm after dinner, barricading themselves against Umbra's homework demands. Outside, the academy's twisted spires cut into the perpetual twilight sky, but in here‚Äîwith candlelight warming their faces and the faint scent of contraband Earth coffee Mo had smuggled in‚Äîthey could almost pretend they were somewhere else entirely.

The room itself was a testament to their first days of awkward cohabitation. Mo's room remained sparse and practical‚Äîa few paperbacks stacked on her nightstand, her barista apron hung as a defiant reminder of her Earth life. Nyx's side, meanwhile, had exploded into chaos‚Äîfabrics in impossible colors draped over furniture, jars of strange substances labeled with codes only they understood, and a collection of small trinkets that seemed to change position when no one was looking.

""I really thought villain school would have more‚ÄîI don't know‚Äîcreativity?"" Mo said, tugging at her ginger hair. ""Not just 'torture this,' 'hex that,' 'monologue until your victim dies of boredom.'""

Nyx sprawled across their bed, their form shifting in subtle waves‚Äînow a few inches taller, now with slightly sharper features, now back again. They'd been unusually quiet since returning from dinner. Despite their enthusiastic descriptions of Demonic Warfare class to anyone who would listen, something about the day had clearly gotten under their skin.

""Did you see how excited Professor Dreadmire was about our Calculated Cruelty project?"" Nyx's voice carried from their bedroom with a hint of forced brightness that didn't match their restless shifting. ""Two thousand words on innovative torture techniques. He actually used the word 'innovative'‚Äîas if there's anything creative about causing pain.""

""You don't have to pretend with us,"" Lucian said quietly. ""Not here."" He hesitated, frost forming at his fingertips before he brushed it away. ""Though my father would say there's much 'innovation' in pain techniques."" His mouth twisted around the word as if repeating a lesson he'd heard countless times but never fully believed. ""It's what they drill into us at home.""

Nyx's form stuttered, then settled into something smaller, more vulnerable than Mo had seen before‚Äîshoulders slightly hunched, colors muted, sharp edges softened. They slowly walked into the shared space and dropped on the couch.

""You know, some part of me wanted to be absolutely brilliant at this,"" they admitted, their voice shifting. ""To be so spectacularly villainous that my family would choke on their precious traditions."" Their form flared dramatically, briefly taking on sharper edges. ""To shove it in my father's perfectly symmetrical face that changing shape doesn't mean I'm weak‚Äîit means I'm everything he fears: unpredictable, uncontainable,"" they grinned suddenly, dangerously, ""and far more interesting at dinner parties.""

Their fingers twisted a small piece of obsidian, turning it over and over. ""But watching Julian today, cataloging his own pain like it was just‚Äîjust data... I don't know if I can be that.""

Mo didn't need much of a reminder to see Julian's trembling hands as if she'd just left him. To hear the clinical detachment in his voice as he narrated his own suffering. ""We have to pass these classes if we want to graduate. And if‚Ä¶ If I want to get full control of Blackthorn Keep.""

""I've been wondering..."" Nyx began, their voice softer than usual, form shifting slightly as if testing the waters of a more vulnerable conversation. ""With everything you've built on Earth, with your powers... couldn't you just go back? Create a new identity if needed?"" They traced a pattern in the air that briefly glimmered. ""Is Blackthorn Keep really worth all... this?"" The question hung in the air, tentative rather than challenging.

""You think I don't ask the same question myself?"" said Mo. ""But now, with the council and their pestering‚Ä¶ It is like they've challenged me. And I have to win!""

""Even so, do we really have to become what they want us to be?"" Lucian asked, his breath frosting in the air despite the room's warmth. He pulled a folded paper from his pocket, the edges worn as if he'd unfolded and refolded it hundreds of times.

""I found this in my family archives,"" he said. ""Written by a village elder whose people were caught in my great-grandfather's territory dispute. Her hands were already freezing when she carved these words into bark. It was copied later.""

The dense paper crackled as he carefully unfolded it. The handwriting was cramped, hurried:

*When ice comes for the innocent,There is no prayer warm enough to* [*save.No*](http://save.No) *hearth fire burns as coldAs the heart of the one who commands the frost.Yet remember this, frozen one:We who die with eyes still seeingBecome ghosts in your mirror,Witnesses to the chill in your veins.*

Silence fell over the room. Mo thought of the –°ouncil at Blackthorn Keep, who expected her to return as a proper Dark Lady‚Äîruthless, cunning, cruel. She thought of Julian's careful eyes, watching her as if trying to determine which world she truly belonged to.

""My family has been freezing people for centuries,"" Lucian continued, refolding the poem. ""They call it 'ice-spiking'‚Äîvery traditional, very elegant. There's a specific spell for it, passed down through generations. I'm supposed to master it this year.""

""Will you?"" Mo asked, looking directly at his silver eyes.

""I don't know,"" he admitted. ""But I keep this poem to remind myself that I have a choice. That legacy isn't destiny.""

Nyx shifted again, their form elongating as they sat up straighter. ""So we just, what? Pretend? Put on a show for the professors while secretly planning to be... not villains?""

""Is that what you're doing?"" Lucian wondered aloud. ""Planning to be not-villains? Is it even a worthy goal, to try not to be something?""

They looked at each other, none willing to answer directly.

""Well, whatever we decide,"" Nyx said finally, their form shifting back to something more recognizable, more like their public self, ""we still have to survive tomorrow.""

Lucian nodded grimly. ""Combat Applications class.""

Mo groaned, her head falling back against the wall. ""Don't remind me. I haven't used offensive magic in years. I've been too busy making heart-shaped latte art.""

""Talking about offensive magic, do you know who you are paired with?"" Lucian asked, his expression shifting to something like pity.

""Who?"" Mo demanded. ""Who am I paired with?""

Nyx and Lucian exchanged glances.

""The class roster went up during dinner,"" Nyx said carefully. ""You were still talking to Julian, so we checked for you.""

A cold weight settled in Mo's stomach. ""Tell me.""

Lucian's breath frosted again as he exhaled. ""It's Valerius.""

Of course, it was. Because villain school couldn't just be about learning evil‚Äîit had to be a special kind of hell explicitly tailored to each student.

""Great,"" Mo muttered, flopping back on her bed. ""Tomorrow I get to duel my teenage nemesis, who's had years of practice while I've been alphabetizing romance novels.""

¬†

\*\*\*

¬†

The crimson moon cast blood-red light across Mo's trembling hands‚Äîhands that had crafted perfect lattes but forgotten how to weave deadly magic. In less than twelve hours, those hands would be all that stood between her and public humiliation... or worse.

""You know what they're saying in the halls, right?"" Nyx asked, their voice unusually somber. ""Combat Applications isn't just about grades. It's where reputations are made. Or destroyed.""

Lucian nodded, frost creeping around his collar. ""First-years who fail spectacularly become walking targets. Every student with something to prove will challenge them, again and again.""

""And with your family name..."" Nyx didn't finish the sentence.

Mo didn't need them to. A weak Nightshade would draw predators like blood in the water. Her provisional status at Blackthorn Keep would be the least of her worries if she couldn't hold her own against Valerius.

""Guys, guys‚Ä¶!"" she exclaimed, pulling her spellbook back into her lap with newfound determination, ""I understand, I'm doomed! So, I guess we'd better make sure we used every remaining hour to train!""

Nyx's form sharpened with resolve. ""Right. We'll practice. Right now.""

But even as Lucian began demonstrating a particularly effective shield charm, Mo couldn't silence the voice in her head that whispered: what if all the coffee grinding and book sorting had dulled something essential within her‚Äîsomething dark and powerful that couldn't simply be switched back on with a few hours of practice?

""It's why I'm allowed here, documenting what your magic does to human physiology. Knowledge is power.""

Mo studied him with a new understanding. ""You don't belong fully in either world.""

""It seems that you don't belong either,"" he replied, surprising her. ""I recognize the signs. The way you hesitate before using formal titles. Your discomfort during the demonstration. You've lived among humans recently.""

For the first time since arriving at Umbra Academy, Mo felt truly seen. All the camaraderie she experienced with Nyx and now Lucian... it was different.

""I managed a bookstore,"" Mo confessed, the words tumbling out before she could reconsider. ""For three years. In a small town where no one knew what I was. I started when I was sixteen. But with my powers‚Ä¶ it wasn't hard to persuade humans that I was a bit more‚Ä¶ mature. So, that's what I was doing, shelving novels, recommending romances to retirees, organizing an occasional poetry reading, and serving lattes.""

Julian's eyes brightened with genuine interest. ""A bookstore? With paperbacks and coffee and those little reading nooks?""

""Exactly that. Mismatched armchairs and a cat that knocked over the displays."" Mo smiled at the memory. ""Not very villainous.""

""Sounds wonderful."" There was honest longing in his voice. ""I haven't been to Earth since I was a child. My family keeps mostly to our compound now‚Äîsafer that way.""

""You miss it,"" Mo realized.

""How can I miss what I barely remember?"" Suddenly, Julian's tone was much more guarded, as if he had realized he had shared too much.

""I dream about my bookstore,"" Mo admitted, tracing a non-existant stain on the desk. ""It's been only a couple of days. But it feels like I've lost that life forever. Like I completely abandoned the person I'd worked so hard to become.""

They stood in silence for a moment, two people stranded between realities, recognizing in each other a shared displacement.

Julian looked away, waiting as if hesitating to spill too much. But then he shrugged and looked directly into Mo's eyes. ""Would you tell me about it sometime?"" he asked. His fingers instinctively touched his experiment logbook before pulling away as if catching himself in a habit. ""Your life there? The human world through the eyes of someone who chose it rather than being born to it?""

Mo tucked a strand of ginger hair behind her ear, her signet ring catching the light. ""Only if you'll tell me about your family,"" she countered. ""How you navigate being human with magical knowledge without getting crushed between worlds. Without ending up as someone's... research assistant.""

Their eyes met, and Mo felt something shift between them‚Äînot a magical connection, but something rarer: understanding.

""It's a deal,"" Julian said, offering his hand.

When their fingers touched, Mo felt a slight jolt‚Äînot the familiar surge of her succubus power seeking to ensnare, but something simpler, more human. Static electricity, perhaps. Or possibility. Behind them, a shadow shifted by the door‚Äîsomeone watching, listening. But in this moment of connection, Mo couldn't care less.

The academy bells tolled, their dissonant melody announcing the dinner hour. Mo withdrew her hand, suddenly aware of how long they'd been talking. ""I should go before Nyx organizes a search party.""

Julian nodded, slipping his notebook into his satchel. ""Until next time, Morgana Nightshade, barista extraordinaire.""

¬†

\*\*\*

¬†

Mo slammed her spellbook shut with enough force that Nyx's budding collection of stolen laboratory specimens rattled on their makeshift shelf. A jar of something with too many eyes blinked rapidly in protest.

The three of them had retreated to Mo and Nyx's dorm after dinner, barricading themselves against Umbra's homework demands. Outside, the academy's twisted spires cut into the perpetual twilight sky, but in here‚Äîwith candlelight warming their faces and the faint scent of contraband Earth coffee Mo had smuggled in‚Äîthey could almost pretend they were somewhere else entirely.

The room itself was a testament to their first days of awkward cohabitation. Mo's room remained sparse and practical‚Äîa few paperbacks stacked on her nightstand, her barista apron hung as a defiant reminder of her Earth life. Nyx's side, meanwhile, had exploded into chaos‚Äîfabrics in impossible colors draped over furniture, jars of strange substances labeled with codes only they understood, and a collection of small trinkets that seemed to change position when no one was looking.

""I really thought villain school would have more‚ÄîI don't know‚Äîcreativity?"" Mo said, tugging at her ginger hair. ""Not just 'torture this,' 'hex that,' 'monologue until your victim dies of boredom.'""

Nyx sprawled across their bed, their form shifting in subtle waves‚Äînow a few inches taller, now with slightly sharper features, now back again. They'd been unusually quiet since returning from dinner. Despite their enthusiastic descriptions of Demonic Warfare class to anyone who would listen, something about the day had clearly gotten under their skin.

""Did you see how excited Professor Dreadmire was about our Calculated Cruelty project?"" Nyx's voice carried from their bedroom with a hint of forced brightness that didn't match their restless shifting. ""Two thousand words on innovative torture techniques. He actually used the word 'innovative'‚Äîas if there's anything creative about causing pain.""

""You don't have to pretend with us,"" Lucian said quietly. ""Not here."" He hesitated, frost forming at his fingertips before he brushed it away. ""Though my father would say there's much 'innovation' in pain techniques."" His mouth twisted around the word as if repeating a lesson he'd heard countless times but never fully believed. ""It's what they drill into us at home.""

Nyx's form stuttered, then settled into something smaller, more vulnerable than Mo had seen before‚Äîshoulders slightly hunched, colors muted, sharp edges softened. They slowly walked into the shared space and dropped on the couch.

""You know, some part of me wanted to be absolutely brilliant at this,"" they admitted, their voice shifting. ""To be so spectacularly villainous that my family would choke on their precious traditions."" Their form flared dramatically, briefly taking on sharper edges. ""To shove it in my father's perfectly symmetrical face that changing shape doesn't mean I'm weak‚Äîit means I'm everything he fears: unpredictable, uncontainable,"" they grinned suddenly, dangerously, ""and far more interesting at dinner parties.""

Their fingers twisted a small piece of obsidian, turning it over and over. ""But watching Julian today, cataloging his own pain like it was just‚Äîjust data... I don't know if I can be that.""

Mo didn't need much of a reminder to see Julian's trembling hands as if she'd just left him. To hear the clinical detachment in his voice as he narrated his own suffering. ""We have to pass these classes if we want to graduate. And if‚Ä¶ If I want to get full control of Blackthorn Keep.""

""I've been wondering..."" Nyx began, their voice softer than usual, form shifting slightly as if testing the waters of a more vulnerable conversation. ""With everything you've built on Earth, with your powers... couldn't you just go back? Create a new identity if needed?"" They traced a pattern in the air that briefly glimmered. ""Is Blackthorn Keep really worth all... this?"" The question hung in the air, tentative rather than challenging.

""You think I don't ask the same question myself?"" said Mo. ""But now, with the council and their pestering‚Ä¶ It is like they've challenged me. And I have to win!""

""Even so, do we really have to become what they want us to be?"" Lucian asked, his breath frosting in the air despite the room's warmth. He pulled a folded paper from his pocket, the edges worn as if he'd unfolded and refolded it hundreds of times.

""I found this in my family archives,"" he said. ""Written by a village elder whose people were caught in my great-grandfather's territory dispute. Her hands were already freezing when she carved these words into bark. It was copied later.""

The dense paper crackled as he carefully unfolded it. The handwriting was cramped, hurried:

*When ice comes for the innocent,There is no prayer warm enough to* [*save.No*](http://save.No) *hearth fire burns as coldAs the heart of the one who commands the frost.Yet remember this, frozen one:We who die with eyes still seeingBecome ghosts in your mirror,Witnesses to the chill in your veins.*

Silence fell over the room. Mo thought of the –°ouncil at Blackthorn Keep, who expected her to return as a proper Dark Lady‚Äîruthless, cunning, cruel. She thought of Julian's careful eyes, watching her as if trying to determine which world she truly belonged to.

""My family has been freezing people for centuries,"" Lucian continued, refolding the poem. ""They call it 'ice-spiking'‚Äîvery traditional, very elegant. There's a specific spell for it, passed down through generations. I'm supposed to master it this year.""

""Will you?"" Mo asked, looking directly at his silver eyes.

""I don't know,"" he admitted. ""But I keep this poem to remind myself that I have a choice. That legacy isn't destiny.""

Nyx shifted again, their form elongating as they sat up straighter. ""So we just, what? Pretend? Put on a show for the professors while secretly planning to be... not villains?""

""Is that what you're doing?"" Lucian wondered aloud. ""Planning to be not-villains? Is it even a worthy goal, to try not to be something?""

They looked at each other, none willing to answer directly.

""Well, whatever we decide,"" Nyx said finally, their form shifting back to something more recognizable, more like their public self, ""we still have to survive tomorrow.""

Lucian nodded grimly. ""Combat Applications class.""

Mo groaned, her head falling back against the wall. ""Don't remind me. I haven't used offensive magic in years. I've been too busy making heart-shaped latte art.""

""Talking about offensive magic, do you know who you are paired with?"" Lucian asked, his expression shifting to something like pity.

""Who?"" Mo demanded. ""Who am I paired with?""

Nyx and Lucian exchanged glances.

""The class roster went up during dinner,"" Nyx said carefully. ""You were still talking to Julian, so we checked for you.""

A cold weight settled in Mo's stomach. ""Tell me.""

Lucian's breath frosted again as he exhaled. ""It's Valerius.""

Of course, it was. Because villain school couldn't just be about learning evil‚Äîit had to be a special kind of hell explicitly tailored to each student.

""Great,"" Mo muttered, flopping back on her bed. ""Tomorrow I get to duel my teenage nemesis, who's had years of practice while I've been alphabetizing romance novels.""

¬†

\*\*\*

¬†

The crimson moon cast blood-red light across Mo's trembling hands‚Äîhands that had crafted perfect lattes but forgotten how to weave deadly magic. In less than twelve hours, those hands would be all that stood between her and public humiliation... or worse.

""You know what they're saying in the halls, right?"" Nyx asked, their voice unusually somber. ""Combat Applications isn't just about grades. It's where reputations are made. Or destroyed.""

Lucian nodded, frost creeping around his collar. ""First-years who fail spectacularly become walking targets. Every student with something to prove will challenge them, again and again.""

""And with your family name..."" Nyx didn't finish the sentence.

Mo didn't need them to. A weak Nightshade would draw predators like blood in the water. Her provisional status at Blackthorn Keep would be the least of her worries if she couldn't hold her own against Valerius.

""Guys, guys‚Ä¶!"" she exclaimed, pulling her spellbook back into her lap with newfound determination, ""I understand, I'm doomed! So, I guess we'd better make sure we used every remaining hour to train!""

Nyx's form sharpened with resolve. ""Right. We'll practice. Right now.""

But even as Lucian began demonstrating a particularly effective shield charm, Mo couldn't silence the voice in her head that whispered: what if all the coffee grinding and book sorting had dulled something essential within her‚Äîsomething dark and powerful that couldn't simply be switched back on with a few hours of practice?

When I re-watched Black Trigger Capture arc, I found it odd how fast Kido seemed to agree with Jin's negotiation when he mentioned his kouhai could help achieve Kido's true goal, especially since he seemed displeased with Jin for his betrayal. I kinda felt like he was almost desperate in a way. On top of that, Kido faction prioritizes the Away missions. Kido's character likes are said to be old films, black coffee and family. I know most characters likes are meant for random trivia, but we have Miwa who's one of his likes is his sister and its related to his backstory so I wonder if Kido‚Äôs 'family' will have significance later on.  

Could he have had one of his family members kidnapped by Neighbors? I think it'd make more sense as to why his ideology towards Neighbors is portrayed as complex. Sure, old members died to Neighbors, but it was a war they chose to fight and I'm not sure if he's the type to abandon the ideals old border was built on so fast.

1mqedlm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroSulcus/comments/1mqedlm/gpt5_vs_dentists_where_they_agree_and_disagree_on/,ü¶∑ GPT-5 vs. Dentists: Where They Agree and Disagree on Gum Disease Care,"After GPT-5 gave its professional-skeptic breakdown of the Zero Sulcus Protocol (ZSP), I thought it‚Äôd be interesting to see **how those points line up with typical dentist views** ‚Äî and where they don‚Äôt.

Here‚Äôs what I came up with.

# 1. Cause of Persistent Gum Pockets

* **GPT-5:** Mechanical removal of *all* subgingival calculus is the only way to truly resolve inflammation and allow reattachment.
* **Dentists:** Generally agree calculus drives inflammation, but most rely on periodic professional cleanings (every 3‚Äì6 months) rather than daily or weekly maintenance.

**‚úÖ Agreement:** Calculus must be removed to heal.  
**‚ùå Difference:** GPT-5 sees ongoing self-maintenance as essential, while dentists stick to in-office schedules.

# 2. Skill and Precision

* **GPT-5:** ZSP‚Äôs success depends heavily on user precision ‚Äî poor technique = poor results.
* **Dentists:** Believe patients can‚Äôt safely or effectively do subgingival cleaning on their own.

**‚úÖ Agreement:** Precision matters.  
**‚ùå Difference:** GPT-5 leaves the door open for skilled, trained individuals to succeed; dentists see it as strictly professional territory.

# 3. Evidence Base

* **GPT-5:** Method is biologically plausible but untested in peer-reviewed trials.
* **Dentists:** Evidence-driven; unlikely to endorse a method without published studies.

**‚úÖ Agreement:** Strong evidence would make the method more credible.  
**‚ùå Difference:** GPT-5 still sees potential based on case logic and results; dentists won‚Äôt recommend until formally validated.

# 4. Role of Supplements and Adjuncts

* **GPT-5:** Sees coffee, oil pulling, and salt rinses as useful *adjuncts* but not substitutes for mechanical removal.
* **Dentists:** May acknowledge rinses can reduce bacterial load, but most view them as minor compared to SRP or surgery.

**‚úÖ Agreement:** Adjuncts aren‚Äôt the main fix.

I am being released today after my myomectomy yesterday. I am still waiting the final  validation of the size but one large one was removed and one other smaller one. 

Finding this community (and some folks that posted on TikTok)helped me prepare for the surgery and feel less anxious. While I haven't posted pics or my journey, I did want to quickly share some tips for anyone about to have surgery.  Of course this is personal to my situation though from what I read I think others may find it helpful. 

1. Bring a long charge cord for your phone. Especially if you have an Android. My phone has been plugged directly into the hospital bed for the whole day and a half and it's not gone above 60%.
2. Consider some ginger for the nausea. They give you medicine and I sort of wished I had one of those ginger shots. 
3. Bring an eye mask. I almost didn't have a room my first night and was able to sleep a lot in the PACU (recovery room). In the regular room, there were lights that were kept on so I do kind of wish I had a sleeping mask. 
4. I brought my headphones and that was the best. I was able to meditate and fall asleep to music. 
5. I packed too much in my bag anticipating I would be here two nights so def go light! 
6. The pillow folks suggest getting was helpful when I needed to get up and move..
7. Be prepared to be smelly. The nurse will wipe you but I know I'm pretty overdue for a shower. 
8. Pain for me was about a 4-6 for most of the time which seemed to be normal. 
9. I did being a book to read which was good for when I wanted a break from the phone 
10. I also brought my toothbrush and face wash and lotion for my face. They did give me a toothbrush which I used my first night and then today I used my toothbrush and face wash and they felt refreshing. 
11. I also brought a bandana which helped me feel better about my wild hair. 
12. I do also recommend downloading your hospital's med app. I have all my test results and surgery notes which is nice. 

And lastly for now... I heard chewing gum once you are able to eat helped with abdominal surgeries. I chewed two pieces and not sure if it helped or not. I did walk the first day in the PACU and then a couple laps in the hallway where my room is. Felt great to walk and I'm excited for that being a part of my recovery. 

Oh and order the veggies! That was the best part of my meals. The coffee was pretty good any my hospital also. 

Hope this helps someone out. And I welcome others to share their tips too!

It wasn't blatantly teaching anything untrue, but was simply spiritually lacking - for instance, not having any Bible reading except a few short verses thrown into the sermon, not having any prayers except a short prayer slot and the closing prayer. It also felt very human-centred - the sermon was based on a Disney film which we watched a probably 10 minute clip from before we ever heard anything from God's Word, and there was a quiz aimed at children which was basically just animal facts.

So after this I've realised there might be some merit to the regulative principle, that it can be bad for a church not just to do things that go explicitly against Scripture, but also the things that deviate from God's standard of how to worship him. But if I accept the regulative principle, does that mean I have to accept all possible out-workings of it? For example, my home church has a slot for notices, a break in the service for talking to your neighbours/getting coffee, and sings modern songs using modern instruments. I've never seen any of that stuff as wrong, but it leaves me with the question of how we decide which elements not explicitly mentioned in the Bible are fine and which are not. Can I think that that service I attended was bad, and that my church's services are generally good, without having any cognitive dissonance? Thanks in advance.",2,1755207695.0,Reformed,1,1.0,False

I have learned, very slowly and painfully over many years, that I have terrible reactions to certain things:

Propylene Glycol (PG): often found in scented candles, flavored coffee/whiskey/tobacco, perfumes.  It's a *very* common food additive and most people have no issues.  I, however, have the strangest reaction.  It gives me migraines, makes my skin itch, feels like I'm about to sweat, and makes my neck and back hurt and hands and feet feel weird.  It's like I'm being microwaved and very itchy.

Artificial Sweeteners: I don't know what it is, but all of them from Aspartame to Sucralose give me a taste that lingers for hours, headaches(no migraines), very flushed, dizzy, and brain foggy.

It's difficult because finding household scents, protein powders, flavored liquor, etc is all a minefield, and it has taken me almost 2 decades to narrow down that this is a problem.  I also come off like a weird snob because I can't drink the ""caramel hazelnut"" coffee. I can't chew *any* gum from the store, it all has aspartame in it, and every time I convince myself it's not real and go for it, it happens.  I can't find much good documentation on it.

My first encounter was when I was a kid, the gym I was in would light citronella candles and they gave me a full-on migraine(which I thought was a headache when I was kid, so I just tanked it), and most recently I have been trying to use a protein powder to keep my macros up while cutting calories and it's just sucralose but it makes my face feel like I have a sunburn and gives me a headache.

I (21F) am in a friendship group. One of my close friends, Hannah (22F) is also in my friendship group. There's five of us, and we talk everyday. 

Hannah is one of the nicest people I've ever met. 'Wouldn't even hurt a fly' kind of person. 

The problem is, she's really tiring to be around. She's scared of everything, and overthinks everything, so it's difficult to be social with her. For instance, when me and her went out specifically for coffee, she decided to not get any purely because she was scared she would get 'bad karma' if she threw it out incorrectly. 

I understand trying to be a good person, but it's gotten to the point where she can't do anything without contacting one of us. She was scared to use a deodorant in her room because she was worried it would light something on fire so she phoned me crying. Last time I went to her house, I had to take her trash out because she was scared of the smell.

It has become so hard for me to make plans because I know how it is going to go every time. I honestly just don't know what to do. Last time I tried to bring this up, she sent me several paragraphs of her saying it'a okay for me to hate her because she's a horrible person. I felt guilt tripped, so I backtracked and said I didn't completely mean what I was saying. 

I feel awful because she has always been there for me when I've needed her. But it's getting a little hard to be there for her in return when it's this constant. What do I do? Do I pull away from the group a little bit? ",2,1755206979.0,AITAH,6,1.0,False

1mqdufn,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/1mqdufn/i_was_crushed_by_my_diagnosis_but_this_simple/,"I Was Crushed by My Diagnosis, But This Simple Practice Brought Me Back","I used to think I was invincible. I was thirty, living in Texas, working as a programmer, and treating my body like an afterthought. All nighters on caffeine, drinking until sunrise, chain smoking whenever stress hit, doomscrolling until my eyes burned. If I could still show up to work, I figured I was fine.

Then came my company‚Äôs annual health check. I almost skipped it. But the report smacked me in the face: early stage chronic gastritis with erosions in my stomach lining. Not cancer. Not deadly‚Ä¶ yet. The doctor warned me that if I kept living like this, it could turn into something much worse.

At first, I brushed it off. Then the symptoms started: constant bloating, sharp stomach pains after heavy meals. I even got nauseous during the meetings. The worst was lying awake at 3 am, clutching my stomach, hating myself for ignoring the warning signs.

One random night, I was scrolling through my phone and came across a line from Papillon: ‚ÄúYour greatest sin is wasting your life.‚Äù I thought, If I died tomorrow, my legacy would be hangovers, a shelf of unread books, and a worn out laptop. That thought broke me.

I quit smoking overnight. Cut alcohol to maybe once a month. Set a strict bedtime, and keep my eyes shut, even when my mind refuses to rest. Started eating lighter, earlier dinners. I put screen limits on my phone and swapped late night scrolling for reading and listening to podcasts. The first week was hell. My body screamed for the old habits. But after a month, my mornings didn‚Äôt feel like a punishment anymore.
Reading became my anchor. Not just for distraction, but for rewiring my brain. Books gave me frameworks for discipline, self awareness, and long term thinking. A few standouts:
Atomic Habits by James Clear, this book ruined all my excuses. Clear makes behavior change feel not just simple but inevitable, with practical ways to break bad habits and replace them with small, consistent wins. I kept it on my desk like a manual. 

What I do is to pair that with The Untethered Soul by Michael A. Singer, which cracked open the realization that so much of my mental suffering was self created. If you‚Äôve ever felt trapped in your own head, his writing feels like someone opening a window to let fresh air in. 
And then, Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker is just like a wakeup call for me. Realizing how much sleep fuels my health and mind turned me into a near saint about protecting my bedtime. Together, these books shifted how I live, my habits, my inner world, and even the way I rest.
When I felt too mentally drained for full books, I found a hack that kept me learning without frying my brain: BeFreed. A friend introduced me, it‚Äôs a smart reading and book summary app built by a team from Columbia University. Perfect for when you‚Äôre working full time & barely have energy left. It turns dense nonfiction into podcast style episodes in different lengths: 10 min quick hits, 20 min recaps, or 40 min deep dives. I even customized my podcast host to be a non judgemental, chill best friend. It feels like we are catching up over coffee. The AI actually learns about your life, struggles, and goals, like my adult ADHD and the demands of my job, and builds a personalized learning roadmap that adapts over time. Now I‚Äôve knocked out books I‚Äôd been ‚Äúmeaning to read‚Äù for years, The Selfish Gene,Cosmos, Poor Charlie‚Äôs Almanack. It‚Äôs the only thing that‚Äôs made reading as addictive as doomscrolling.

I also leaned on other free, high value resources. The Ten Percent Happier Podcast gave me practical, mindfulness based tools for stress, sleep, and focus that I could apply immediately. The YouTube channel Better Ideas kept me inspired with short, cinematic takes on self discipline and meaning. Together, these turned my downtime into actual fuel for growth instead of a black hole.

Now my life is unrecognizable. I wake up earlier without hating it. I take morning walks. I cook for myself more than I order in. Nights out are about connection, not numbing myself. I‚Äôve been to Burningman, the Grand Canyon, Georgia coast, places I always said I‚Äôd go ‚Äúsomeday.‚Äù I even started horseback riding and golf just to prove to myself I can still learn new skills.

The health checks still make me nervous, but they also remind me how far I‚Äôve come. They‚Äôre no longer about waiting for bad news, they‚Äôre proof I‚Äôm investing in myself. If I could go back, I‚Äôd start sooner. You don‚Äôt need a life threatening diagnosis to change your life.

1mqdrdf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mqdrdf,An alone together solo girls camping trip report.,"Howdy! 
So here‚Äôs how this started: 
Last year I mentioned I like camping alone (44 year old female), and my friend (30 something year old female) said she couldn‚Äôt fathom that and she would be scared to do it. Somehow over the course of a year I was like ‚Äúwe shouldn‚Äôt be scared,‚Äù and I got really annoyed. So in February I sent out a group text to a bunch of my friends and said ‚ÄúI booked sites 58 and 59 at Bay View State Park in WA from 8/11-8/14. If anyone wants to go, you‚Äôre super welcome.‚Äù Originally 15 people said they were down, 10 sites booked surrounding 58 and 59. But the time came and we had over the course of that trip 8 women/girls that stated from 1 night to the whole thing. 2 husbands came for dinner one night.  

We had 4 campsites. 61, 59, 58, and 55. 58 and 59 you needed to book together. Had they been separated it would have been very tight, and I don‚Äôt think you get good value because they‚Äôre each like 3/4th a site. Like separate they‚Äôre very small. The group ended up eating and hanging at those two sites because they had the most sun (the website said they get partial sun but dudes‚Ä¶ I was roasting.). The sites were close to the bathrooms, had nice access to potable water so you could do your dishes, and was just in a good location. We enjoyed walks along with loop and to the beach. For females afraid of camping without men, this was a good beginning spot.

The negatives? I had posted about raccoons earlier. I was ocd in my campsites, but my friend had left the skewers from marshmallows on her table and she heard the raccoons play with them. We found paw prints on her table. The next night I kept hearing things and I was like ‚Äúhello?‚Äù And I stood up in my tent looking around outside. Nothing. But we kept things secure and it was fine. The other negative? We should have planned food better with the group. We each brought enough food for each meal to serve everyone going. A couple nights we had potluck meat fest! Like I marinated chicken with lemon and mustard before we left and cooked that in a skillet on the camp stove, my friend had grilled some Korean short ribs, and we had epic sides all for one night. It was so good. So I think we need to plan food better? I also for some reason thought every person going needed 12 cans of soda? So I have soooo much soda still. 

Here‚Äôs explanations of the pictures:
1.) Sites 58 and 59. You can see my tent and car. The picnic tables were pushed together. I had a card table with chairs for the kids so they could color and do stuff. My friend hung her hammock between the trees. I hung a rope between trees to keep kitchen gadgets and the first aide kit. 
2.) a simple snake. As I was puttering about while folks were at the beach, this critter made a visit. I was so shocked I screamed. I‚Äôve been in Washington for 16 years and always forget we have snakes. 
3.) again packed too much food, so lunch cheeseburgers and potato salad. So good. 
4.) camping charcuterie. Seriously this was soooo good. And we ended up using that pepper jam for breakfast tacos with pancakes griddled on the black stone grill, sausage, and eggs. Oh golly!
5.) breakfast burritos that I meal prepped and froze a couple days before the trip. Spam/eggs/hashbrown/cheese. I wrapped it in tinfoil and parchment paper that I sprayed in non stick spray and then the last day we just put those on the flattop in the foil wrap, and it was a hearty breakfast while we packed stuff up.
6.) my Leaf filled to the brim. Another friend was like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have the right car to be outdoorsy.‚Äù Dude. I drive an elder Leaf with limited range. And I wanted to include this picture to show we can do things like camp solo as a woman and drive a little sedan. 
7.) morning coffee. I have a little French press and a Temptations (from qvc) kettle, and that‚Äôs how I made coffee every morning. I wake up earlier than my friends, so I got the peaceful morning coffee, and then got to make them coffee. 
8.) my little ‚Äúlock‚Äù on my tent. 

Showers are free but be respectful time wise and bring shower shoes. This was a great little trip and feel sooooo good afterwards. My friends are already talking about next years trip.

# 0. The Hook: What I Want

If you‚Äôre hearing my voice, please don‚Äôt try to find me.  
I don‚Äôt want you to be brave. I want you to live long enough to forget this.

I‚Äôm going to tell you what happened in the Shadelands so you‚Äôll stop thinking you‚Äôre safe if you‚Äôre fast, or clever, or armed. I‚Äôm going to tell you because I want one thing that matters more than me: **I want the hunting to stop.**

It won‚Äôt. But I have to try.

I‚Äôve cut this into chapters so if you feel the hair on your arms lift, you can stop, breathe, and pretend you didn‚Äôt read the next part. Every chapter will leave a mark. That‚Äôs how you‚Äôll know it‚Äôs true.

# 1. Assignment: The Normal We Thought We Had

The winter they sent us out, I was a contractor for a wildlife survey outfit that took municipal grants and private money nobody asked about. Our official title: **FAUNA ANOMALY RECOVERY TEAM**‚ÄîFART for short‚Äîbecause scientists are still children with better vocabulary. We were three:

* **Marshall** (the guide), rope burn scars around his wrists, smelled like cedar smoke and old pennies. Knew the mountains by pulse.
* **Kit** (tech), who talked in handheld frequencies and ate instant noodles dry like chips.
* **Me** (Ezra), cartographer. I drew the absence of roads.

We hiked into a notch of forest that maps avoid, a geometry error between county parcels where property lines forget how to meet. People call it the **Shadelands**. That‚Äôs not a name. It‚Äôs a warning.

On day one, our trail cams captured a silhouette like a hang glider tacked to the moon. On day two, **footprints**: not paws, not boots‚Äîsomething heavy that flexed the snow into starbursts. Kit tagged them ‚Äúungulate,‚Äù which is Latin for **we don‚Äôt know**, but whatever made those prints carried a second rhythm in the ice, a faint halo of divots spaced too regular to be weather.

‚ÄúThey ran around it,‚Äù Marshall said, crouched, gloved finger hovering. ‚ÄúSomething fast. Faster than you can turn your head.‚Äù

I laughed, because that‚Äôs what you do when you encounter a fact that doesn‚Äôt yet have a folder. I kept laughing until our radios woke up.

The static wasn‚Äôt static.

If you‚Äôve ever scrubbed a video and watched someone sprint‚Äîarms jittering, motions jumped forward frame by frame‚Äîthat‚Äôs what the voices sounded like: **time chewed and spat back**. Kit boosted gain. The words braided:

>

Marshall stood so fast his knees cracked. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre here,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúWho?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt answer. He tightened his pack. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre leaving.‚Äù

Ten minutes later, as snow started to fall in feathers, our fire coughed and **someone was standing in it.**

You know how a hot day wobbles? Heat shimmer. That was this man‚Äôs outline: **black suit** painted onto a body that wasn‚Äôt precious about oxygen. His hair was blond, damp with melt. **Blue eyes**, bright as frozen lakes. The fire ate around his boots like it was afraid to touch him.

‚ÄúTwo miles east,‚Äù he said. Calm. Too calm. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve gathered.‚Äù

It wasn‚Äôt a threat. It was a schedule.

# 2. Inciting: The Ones Who Hunt the Monsters

We saw them where the slope softened into a bowl of old growth, snow shelved on fallen logs like white loaves. First the **thunderbird**, a shadow that chopped the moon into coins. Then the **giant arachnids**‚Äînot delicate house spiders, but antique furnaces plated in hair and iridescence, their silk lines humming like power cables. A family of **sasquatch** pressing in, knuckles snow-burned. And at the front, wearing a wolf like a decision, stood **Silverfang**.

He was wrong the way a cathedral in a cul-de-sac is wrong. Taller than any person has a right to be, pelt like **metal filings**, eyes the color of old paper held to a lamp. He looked at us the way a paramedic looks at a car flipped in a ditch: assessing. Choosing.

Then the man from our fire smiled. ‚ÄúTime to cull.‚Äù

What happened next wasn‚Äôt a fight. **It was editing.**

He wasn‚Äôt running so much as moving between frames of an animation we were too slow to see. He was at the far tree line‚Äî**slash**‚Äîand a thunderbird screamed with a mouth like a door. He ghosted under the webs‚Äî**snap**‚Äîand silk fell like unraveled wedding dresses. He stepped past the sasquatch‚Äî**crack**‚Äîand something inside one of them forgot its job.

Sound lagged behind by half a heartbeat, like the world had to buffer.

Marshall fired. The bullet turned into an event that hadn‚Äôt happened yet. The man tilted his head. The bullet arrived, offended, ten feet to the left, burying itself in bark like it was embarrassed.

‚ÄúStop,‚Äù someone said.

A **red streak** stitched itself into a person beside him‚Äî**a woman**, same kind of suit but listening to the color red the way the first man listened to black. **Hair neon-pink**, eyes a green that reminded me of cedar boughs after rain. Ozone hung off her like perfume.

‚ÄúLeave them,‚Äù she told him. Voice with edges. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not your enemies.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not yours,‚Äù he said, smiling without moving any other part of his face. ‚ÄúAnd they don‚Äôt belong here.‚Äù

He blurred. She **met** him.

Collision like a thunderclap shoved the air against our teeth. For not-quite seconds at a time they were statues, fists colliding; then they were **elsewhere**, carving spirals into snow, the forest‚Äôs ribs showing through in splinters.

The cryptids scattered around their storm. Silverfang lifted his head and howled a sound that tasted like iron. He did not attack. He **signaled**.

Something far away answered.

We ran.

I would like to tell you I ran because I had a plan. I ran because **I was small** and the world had decided to show me its teeth.

We made it twenty yards. Marshall vanished. Not fell. Not tripped. **Vanished.** His boots were still in the snow, smoldering at the laces. A centimeter of ash where his ankles would have been. Kit grabbed my pack harness and didn‚Äôt let go even when I dragged both of us into a ditch under a fallen cedar.

Snow sealed us in. The sound outside went from **war** to **whisper**.

When it went quiet, Silverfang stood where our footprints ended. He peered under the log with those patient eyes and said, very softly, to the wolf in his throat:

‚ÄúPick a side, slow-blood.‚Äù

He left us there. He **let** us live.

I have spent every day since trying to understand **why**.

# 3. New Rules: What Speed Does to the World

We got back to town at dawn, stumbling through a strip mall that had just remembered it was morning. Kit‚Äôs eyes were wrong. She kept **flinching** at nothing. Not nothing‚Äî**somethings** we couldn‚Äôt see yet.

‚ÄúShadelands are moving,‚Äù she said, watching air instead of me. ‚ÄúI can feel the drop-offs.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat drop-offs?‚Äù I asked.

She tapped her temple. ‚ÄúPlaces where time gets **thin**.‚Äù

You ever see heat mirage hang over blacktop? You think it‚Äôs water until you drive through it and realize it‚Äôs *the air itself buckling*. That‚Äôs how the sidewalks felt. The crosswalk light flashed **WALK** and I stepped out, and in the corner of my eye the street emptied‚Äî**no cars, no people**‚Äîlike someone had cut a scene to save time. Then it snapped back and I was halfway across, and a delivery truck howled past where I would have been if the world hadn‚Äôt **hiccuped**.

I didn‚Äôt sleep. When I closed my eyes I saw a gloved hand reaching and my body refusing to be where my body was. I heard Marshall saying, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre here,‚Äù except his mouth was a hollow hat full of sparks.

That night the red woman stood in my kitchen.

No footsteps. No door. Just **there**, the fridge light painting her suit the color of cherry cough syrup. She looked smaller in a house. Less weapon. More person.

‚ÄúYou helped them,‚Äù I said. My voice sounded borrowed.

‚ÄúI stopped him,‚Äù she corrected. ‚ÄúFor now.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

Her gaze flicked to the window, the streetlight, the way the moths hammered against it. ‚ÄúBecause culling is lazy. Because things that hunt all the time forget what they‚Äôre hunting for.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou keep saying ‚Äòthey‚Äô like you are not one of them.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt smile. ‚ÄúYou think speed is a team?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat should I call you?‚Äù

That earned something like a shrug. ‚ÄúCall me **Trace**.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe other one?‚Äù

‚Äú**Havik**,‚Äù she said, like a blade‚Äôs name. ‚ÄúHe thinks cleaning up the world means making it easier to run through.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd the cryptids?‚Äù

She studied the mugs on my counter like they were chess. ‚ÄúThey are older rules, walking. They don‚Äôt fit with roads and clocks. They made a deal a long time ago. They keep to the **Shadelands** and the Shadelands keep to **nowhere**.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen why are they here?‚Äù

She looked up. The green in her eyes warmed. Or I hallucinated hope. ‚ÄúBecause nowhere is shrinking.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you want from me?‚Äù I asked, finding anger like a coat in a cold room. ‚ÄúWhy my kitchen? Why my life?‚Äù

Trace reached for my fridge magnet shaped like Washington and pinned a napkin underneath it. On the napkin, a map‚Äîmy map, the kind I draw when the county wants to pretend it didn‚Äôt spill something. She drew a circle. A **kill zone** you could almost fit a town into.

‚ÄúYou know the lines where things don‚Äôt match,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúProperty. Zoning. Old rights-of-way. There‚Äôs a seam through Wentham that‚Äôs going to split. Havik will run clean through it.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you want me to‚Ä¶ map it?‚Äù

‚ÄúI want you to be slower than him in the right places.‚Äù She pressed the napkin into my hand. ‚ÄúSpeed is dumb. It misses more than it hits. If you make him trip, I can make him **stay**.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd Marshall?‚Äù I asked, before I could stop myself. ‚ÄúWhat happened to him?‚Äù

Trace‚Äôs face folded into something human. ‚ÄúHe got stepped between.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can fix that?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut I can stop it from happening again.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy me?‚Äù I said, because I am nothing if not stubborn. ‚ÄúThere are cops. Military. You could walk into any base in the country and say ‚Äòboo‚Äô and they‚Äôd give you a drone.‚Äù

‚ÄúI tried,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey measured me. They wanted to know why I was fast. They never asked **where** I was going.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere are you going?‚Äù

‚ÄúTo get Havik to stop,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd to stay that way.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat if he won‚Äôt?‚Äù

Trace looked at the window again, where a moth was battering itself into powder. ‚ÄúThen I have to run farther than I‚Äôve ever run, and I need him to **trip at the edge**. That‚Äôs you, Ezra. You draw the edge.‚Äù

When she was gone, the napkin stank of ozone and evergreen.

I found myself believing her without knowing why.

Maybe because the streetlight outside flickered and in one flicker I saw **eyes** in the shadow at the curb‚Äîyellow, patient. Silverfang, sitting like a dog who has learned that if it waits long enough, humans feed it the world.

# 4. Complications: The Ones Who Don‚Äôt Fit in Pictures

I started noticing what I used to edit out of my life. Roads that weren‚Äôt on maps. Fences with no property behind them. A creek that turned left into a **thicket of air** that felt colder when you put your hand through it.

Kit stopped coming to work. Her apartment smelled like solder and black coffee and the sweet, sick-metal smell of **ozone after a shock**. She had pried open a police radar gun and wired it into a bundle of sensor leads that stuck to her temples with medical tape.

‚Äú**You‚Äôve been seeing it too,**‚Äù she said when I showed up with a paper bag of groceries and an apology I didn‚Äôt know how to phrase. ‚ÄúSpeed shadows. Places where time skims.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not sleeping,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt,‚Äù she said, and smiled too wide. ‚ÄúI can hear when they‚Äôre near. The air loses moisture. You can pick it up on hygrometers. Speed is a **dry wind**.‚Äù

‚ÄúTrace needs us,‚Äù I said, and I watched knowledge become a weight on Kit‚Äôs shoulders. She didn‚Äôt ask who Trace was. She already knew the shape of her in the world by the vacuum she left.

We mapped the seam through Wentham: old rail spur, culverts that dead-ended, property lines from the 1890s when a drunk surveyor decided the river turned where his whiskey did. It cut right through **Hansen Park**, a ring of maples shaped like a mouth. If Havik wanted to make a clean jog through town‚Äîshave off the Shadelands, corner them into **nowhere**‚Äîhe‚Äôd run right there.

Trace appeared on the park bench at midnight. No drama. No thunderclap. Just sat, elbows on knees, hair wet like she‚Äôd run through **fog** the world couldn‚Äôt see.

‚ÄúIf you use the culvert,‚Äù I said, pointing on my tablet, ‚Äúhe‚Äôll follow. He likes efficient lines. It‚Äôs the shortest path through the seam.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôll know it‚Äôs a trap,‚Äù Kit said.

Trace‚Äôs mouth tilted. ‚ÄúHe thinks everything‚Äôs a trap. He thinks that‚Äôs noble.‚Äù

We set bait. We left a trail of **speed**.

‚ÄúCan you‚Äî‚Äù I started, and Trace nodded, stood, and **ran** in a straight line across the grass, slow enough for us to see, fast enough to stitch the air. Dew hissed. The grass turned white in a stripe. The line led into the culvert under the park, an old pipe big enough to crawl, a ribcage of iron welded into the earth.

‚ÄúWill he smell you?‚Äù I asked.

Trace didn‚Äôt look at me. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll smell culling.‚Äù

We waited. Snow fell a little and then all at once. The park lamps hummed. Somewhere a bottle broke and laughter tried too hard to prove it was laughter.

Silverfang stood at the far end of the lawn. Not close. Not hidden. Just **there**, a statue left by a civilization that decided statues should scare us into being good.

We didn‚Äôt wave. We didn‚Äôt look. We pretended not to see each other.

If you‚Äôre wondering why we trusted a werewolf, the answer is this: **he hadn‚Äôt killed us** when we were slow and stupid, and that makes a powerful introduction.

# 5. The Midpoint: The Truth Under the Trees

Havik came like a zipper ripping open the night.

You hear speed before you see it. Not footfalls. **Air moving out of the way**. Havik‚Äôs arrival turned my stomach inside out like he‚Äôd rearranged barometric pressure just to watch us puke. He didn‚Äôt appear in the culvert mouth. He appeared five inches to the right of where he should have been, because perfection is for saints.

He didn‚Äôt look at me. He didn‚Äôt look at Kit. He looked past us, eyes drinking the culvert, the plan, the **efficiency**.

‚ÄúThis is cute,‚Äù he said.

Trace stepped out from behind the utility shed. ‚ÄúCome chase me if you can do more than follow lines.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlways,‚Äù Havik said, and ran.

Trace dipped into the culvert and Havik went after her, blue and black like a bruise. The culvert lit with sparks I could smell. The air tasted like a thunderstorm had died in my mouth.

‚ÄúNow,‚Äù Kit whispered, and pressed enter on her laptop.

We had hacked the city‚Äôs grid‚Äîdon‚Äôt ask‚Äîand dumped every watt we could into the culvert‚Äôs decommissioned **induction loop**, a loop used to count cars once upon a better day. It woke up and tried to count **gods**.

Speed hates certain things. It hates corners. It hates friction. It hates being **seen**. The loop saw them both, counted them, insisted they existed in a way that left fingerprints on their speed. Havik stumbled.

Trace didn‚Äôt. She **wanted** to be counted. She wanted to leave a trail anyone could follow.

Havik turned his stumble into a skid and came out the other side with murder in his eyes. He saw me the way a falcon sees a mouse that has made the mistake of living.

He ran at me.

Time did the thing I think of as **peeling**. The present sloughed away and I was watching myself be still and die and be gone and also I was standing there with my hands out like you do with a charging dog if you want it to bite you in the hands and not the throat. Silverfang wasn‚Äôt where he had been. I didn‚Äôt see him move. He was suddenly **between** me and Havik. That‚Äôs all.

You shouldn‚Äôt be able to hear teeth **whisper**, but I did.

Havik grinned. ‚ÄúDog,‚Äù he said.

Silverfang did not growl. He said, in a voice a man might use if he had never learned shame, ‚ÄúWe keep our side. You keep yours.‚Äù

‚ÄúI keep what‚Äôs efficient,‚Äù Havik said, and stepped sideways into a space with no room in it.

He hit Silverfang in the ribs while Silverfang was still unfurling from a man into a wolf into a shape caves remember. Bones made noises that welled bile in my mouth. Silverfang‚Äôs paw‚Äîhand‚Äîsomething‚Äîcaught Havik‚Äôs shoulder and left a **groove** in the black suit that never smoothed. You could measure it. You could hang a reason on it.

Trace blurred back. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs marked,‚Äù she said, breath skirling the air. ‚ÄúHe bleeds.‚Äù

Havik touched the groove and looked at the red on his fingers and **laughed**.

Not triumph. Not mirth.

**Relief.**

I understand now. The midpoint wasn‚Äôt our trap. It was the truth Havik wanted us to see: **he wanted to bleed.** You don‚Äôt hunt unless you‚Äôre hunting for a feeling. He wasn‚Äôt culling. He was chasing the only thing faster than him‚Äî**pain**.

He ran away, laughing. And the snow hissed closed over his tracks like it was ashamed of having hosted any of us.

# 6. Pressure: The City That Became an Arena

Havik didn‚Äôt leave town. He ran **through** it.

I don‚Äôt mean he sprinted the streets like a marathoner on meth. He moved **inside the bones** of the place‚Äîthrough subfloors, ducting, alleys, the negative space behind billboards. Every time he passed, the lights snapped. A side street lost gravity for a heartbeat. A bus arrived before its driver had put on his hat. Our town **broke rhythm**.

The Shadelands opened like wet paper. Things seeped in at the edges: silhouettes that had never learned how to be **daytime**, a smell like damp leaves and old teeth. People started reporting stray dogs that watched them back with the posture of a **man reading**. Something large brushed a parked car and the car **bowed**.

News stations called it a cold snap. They do that when the world breaks; they put a temperature on it.

Kit and I slept in shifts. When I woke, my skin felt unstitched and rebuttoned wrong. Every time I closed my eyes, I dreamed of the culvert counting gods and failing and trying again.

Trace stopped coming by the front door. She started showing up in **reflections**. I‚Äôd be brushing my teeth and she‚Äôd be in the mirror behind me, scanning the street like a mother at a playground pretending not to worry.

‚ÄúWhat happens if he wins?‚Äù I asked her reflection one dawn while the sun thought about being brave.

‚ÄúThe Shadelands pinch to a line so thin even stories can‚Äôt walk it,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou know what happens when you write a word too small? You stop seeing it. It stops meaning anything. That‚Äôs what culling is. He wants a world that‚Äôs easier to **ignore**.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you?‚Äù

Her reflection‚Äôs mouth did a sad thing. ‚ÄúI want a world where running **to** something matters more than running **from** it.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs that why you‚Äôre different?‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt answer. She stood very still in the mirror, and I realized mirrors didn‚Äôt mean anything to her. She was a suggestion there out of kindness to me. Her body was a rumor that time told itself.

‚ÄúWhy can we even talk?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúWhy not just‚Äî‚Äù I gestured at a blur. ‚Äú‚Äîrun and be done.‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause you have to decide too,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBecause we‚Äôre good at force, and very, very bad at consent.‚Äù

She left the mirror. The apartment felt empty like a church after a funeral.

# 7. The Cryptid Parliament

They called it a meeting. It looked like a **threat**.

In the middle of the baseball diamond at Jensen Middle School‚Äîlong since snowed over‚Äî**they gathered**. The thunderbird took the backstop and bent it like tin. The spider trio hung their cables from floodlights and made a net no human eye could complete. A sasquatch family sat on the bleachers and looked like brown coats someone had draped over a fence. And **Silverfang** stood in the pitcher‚Äôs mound like he was deciding which game we were playing.

We went because Kit triangulated a drop in humidity that meant a lot of speed had passed very slowly, if that makes sense. It doesn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs okay. Sense is **expensive** here.

Silverfang didn‚Äôt sniff when we arrived. He didn‚Äôt posture. He **looked** at me. At my hands. At my maps.

‚ÄúYou would draw the edges,‚Äù he said. Not a question.

‚ÄúSomeone has to,‚Äù I said.

He tipped his head‚Äîand there was a **man** inside the wolf, an old man, the kind whose nails are always clean and whose shoes are left by the door. ‚ÄúWe held the Shadelands when your kind forgot to hold the dark. You hung lights and called it victory. We held the pieces that didn‚Äôt want light.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt ask you to,‚Äù I said, because courage is easier around monsters than around rent.

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt ask,‚Äù he agreed. ‚ÄúYou also didn‚Äôt **thank**.‚Äù

Kit cleared her throat. ‚ÄúHavik. He‚Äôs trying to draw a straight line through your side.‚Äù

‚ÄúHis line,‚Äù Silverfang said, ‚Äúwill cut us into **hides**.‚Äù

‚ÄúTrace says she can hold him if we make him trip at the edge.‚Äù

At the name, the thunderbird shuffled, a roll of feathers like someone pulling a tarp over a secret. The spiders leaned together and hummed a chord that passed for agreement. Silverfang‚Äôs ear turned like a compass needle.

‚ÄúShe is **fast**,‚Äù he said. It was not praise; it was a species, a kingdom, a phylum.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not him,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Silverfang said. ‚ÄúBut she is not us.‚Äù

Kit held up her palm, trembling, as if to a skittish dog. ‚ÄúWe can help each other. We‚Äôre good with the parts of the world that use **numbers**. You‚Äôre good with the parts that don‚Äôt. We make a line he can‚Äôt run through. You hold it. She closes it.‚Äù

Silverfang thought long enough for the cold to gnaw my teeth. Finally: ‚ÄúWe do not **owe** you because the sky gnawed a hole in itself and a hunter fell through. But we will stand where we have always stood.‚Äù

‚ÄúOn the mound?‚Äù I asked, because sometimes my mouth does me no favors.

He bared his teeth, but it wasn‚Äôt laughter. ‚ÄúOn the **edge**,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt move to meet the hunt. The hunt moves to us, and we decide if it goes home with meat.‚Äù

That was the deal. Not peace. Not alliance.

**Co-presence**.

You don‚Äôt know how to write that in a treaty. You have to live it.

# 8. The Trap That Needed Belief

We turned Hansen Park into a place **maps would hate**. We rerouted sprinklers, buried copper wire in a circle, rang the old culvert with salt not because we believed salt did anything to speed but because **belief** is a material too. Kit lugged a car battery out of her trunk and clipped it to the copper. My hands shook. I hadn‚Äôt slept in days. The napkin Trace had drawn on was now an entire **atlas**: where the wind felt thinner, where dogs refused to walk, where frost settled in shapes like writing.

Trace came dusk-slow and stood in the ring like someone who had chosen to walk on purpose. She looked at the copper, the salt, the map pins.

‚ÄúThis will not hold him,‚Äù she said, like we had offered her a napkin to stop a vine from taking a house.

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt have to,‚Äù Kit said, breath fogging. ‚ÄúIt has to **announce** him. The grid will see him. Everyone will see him. He‚Äôll have to decide if he‚Äôs an animal or a story.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôll decide story,‚Äù Trace said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs always wanted to be a moral.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre fast,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúbut you **stop**. You came to my kitchen. You sat on my bench. You looked out windows. I think you want a **place**. He wants a **route**. Place beats route if people hold it together.‚Äù

Trace turned her head in that way that made you see the red of her hair like a **sign** on a highway: warning, invitation, both. ‚ÄúYou talk like an old animal,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúI got lost,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThe old animals showed me how to stop panicking.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen stand,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWhen he runs, don‚Äôt move.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat if he hits me?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll survive,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúOr you won‚Äôt. Either way, you‚Äôll make a **choice**, and choices are heavier than speed.‚Äù

I wanted to tell her that was a terrible pep talk. I wanted to tell her I was no one and nothing and very, very bad at being brave.

I nodded instead.

Silverfang took a place at the copper circle‚Äôs north point, a compass in fur. The thunderbird took east, spiders west, sasquatch south. The park smelled like crushed maple leaves and coins and something else I realized was **breath**‚Äîbreath held.

We waited.

Snow fell. The lamps hummed.

The world **peeled**.

# 9. Crisis: The City Tries to Look Away

Havik arrived by erasing what was between us.

Like someone had pressed **skip** on a scene where you exhale, he was **inside** the circle, not outside, not crossing, just inside. He looked at the copper. He looked at the salt.

‚ÄúThis is a joke,‚Äù he said.

Trace stepped out of a nothing and said, ‚ÄúThen laugh.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt. He looked right at me. If blue could be sharp, his eyes were. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the slow-blood who draws lines.‚Äù

‚ÄúSomeone has to,‚Äù I said, and my voice didn‚Äôt shake, which is a lie: it did, and then it didn‚Äôt, and both mattered.

‚ÄúI like your work,‚Äù Havik said. ‚ÄúYou make my job clean.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat job is that?‚Äù Kit asked, because even when God is in the room you can‚Äôt stop a scientist from peer review.

‚ÄúMaking the world run,‚Äù Havik said. ‚ÄúRemoving drag.‚Äù

‚ÄúDrag is how planes fly,‚Äù Kit said.

He tilted his head. ‚ÄúYou think I don‚Äôt know that? I just don‚Äôt think **you** get to be the wing.‚Äù

He ran.

Trace **met** him. The ring flashed. The copper spit sparks. The grid hiccuped and every house light in three blocks stepped one inch to the left in time. Havik moved like a sermon. Trace moved like a dare. They collided and the **sound** of it rattled Silverfang‚Äôs teeth into my bones.

Then Havik did something new.

He stopped.

‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù Trace asked, wind holding its breath in her voice.

‚ÄúWhat you want,‚Äù Havik said, smiling, and he **reached**. Not for her.

**For me.**

He put his hand on my chest, gentle as a doctor about to apologize.

‚ÄúConsent,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou wanted it. So say yes.‚Äù

To what? I would have asked, but asking is a kind of yes.

He pushed.

I fell backward out of myself and landed in a version of the park where no one had thought to put a park. There was just a **straight line**: sidewalk, road, interstate, runway, horizon. Things made sense here if your blood was engine coolant. I understood for a second why he culled. It felt **easy**.

Havik‚Äôs voice came from everywhere a straight line lives. ‚ÄúImagine it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNo detours. No snarls. No beasts in the **gutter of time**. Everyone gets where they‚Äôre going.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd where is that?‚Äù I asked the road.

‚ÄúForward,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúToward what?‚Äù I asked.

Silence. The kind that lives in server rooms and rocket hangars, busy, violent, empty.

Then another voice: **Trace**, quiet, the sound of someone refusing to be convinced. ‚ÄúEzra. Choose.‚Äù

I thought of the culvert counting gods. I thought of Silverfang not killing us. I thought of Kit, awake and singing to her sensors because sleep made her useless and awake made her alive. I thought of a thunderbird bending a backstop, a spider humming a chord, a sasquatch setting a baby down gently like a log.

‚ÄúForward to where?‚Äù I said again, and I put my hand against the inside of the straight line. It burned. I pushed anyway. I am not brave, but I am **stubborn**. The line gave like hot plastic.

I fell back into my body hard enough to make my teeth clack. Havik swayed, just a fraction‚Äîjust enough. Trace turned that fraction into a shove. They tumbled, speed stuttering, bodies suddenly **honest**.

‚ÄúNow!‚Äù Kit cried, and threw the **switch** I didn‚Äôt know she‚Äôd wired: not on the battery, not on the copper, but on the **city**. Substations shunted. Streetlamps shouldered. The grid sang a note made of every refrigerator and baby monitor and phone charger in Wentham, and it **named** Havik: there, there, there.

Speed hates being **located**. Havik jerked like the name itself bit him. He tried to run out of the ring and hit the edge like a glass door he hadn‚Äôt known was closed.

He looked at me one last time and in his eyes I saw the mercy he thought culling was. It wasn‚Äôt bloodlust. It was **tidying**.

‚ÄúIf the world doesn‚Äôt run,‚Äù he said, more to himself than me, ‚Äúit **rots**.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt composts,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how the forest eats.‚Äù

He looked almost sad. ‚ÄúYou want to be eaten?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI want to be **part**.‚Äù

Trace put her hand flat against his chest and **pushed**. Everything fast in the world **shuddered**.

Havik **stayed**.

He didn‚Äôt die. I don‚Äôt think their kind does that the way we mean it. He stayed like a violin note held until the horsehair wears flat. He stayed until staying was the only movement he could make.

Trace looked at me with a face emptied of triumph. ‚ÄúYou should go home,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúWhat about you?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúI need to run,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôll come back.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt promise. That‚Äôs how I knew she meant it.

# 10. The Aftermath Nobody Wants

The next morning the news blamed rolling blackouts, and then blamed a raccoon for chewing cable, and then blamed ‚Äúextreme weather‚Äù for the way several people in a four-block radius woke up on their kitchen floors with **nosebleeds** and a new taste in their mouths: copper and cedar and the edge of a storm.

Hansen Park looked like any park after a concert: trampled, dirty, not special. If you looked hard you could see a groove in the grass where something had tried to be a line and **failed**.

Kit slept for the first time in days and woke to texts from numbers we didn‚Äôt know asking what she did to their bill. She threw her phone into the sink, turned on the tap, watched the screen crackle with **clean** electricity for once.

Silverfang came to my porch around midnight and sat. He didn‚Äôt ask to come in. He didn‚Äôt have to. I opened the door and leaned in the frame like I had a right to pretend I owned this square of world.

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù I said.

He blinked his page-colored eyes. ‚ÄúWe stood,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou stood. The fast ones were forced to choose a place. That is all.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs Havik‚Äî‚Äù I trailed off because the word ‚Äúdead‚Äù felt childish around something that had never been alive the way I was.

‚ÄúHe is **tired**,‚Äù Silverfang said. ‚ÄúThe kind of tired that changes the color of your teeth.‚Äù

‚ÄúWill he come back?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Silverfang said, like gravity saying ‚Äúdown.‚Äù

‚ÄúWill Trace?‚Äù

Silverfang turned his long head and looked at the streetlamp like a hunter remembering the stars before electricity. ‚ÄúShe is making something out of herself,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat takes time. Even for them.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome to‚Ä¶ knock,‚Äù I said, because my mother raised me to offer cookies to anyone who saved my life, even if they could crush me with a casual yawn.

He stood. In the porch light he was a dozen things stacked perfectly, all of them **true**. He put his paw on the stoop and left no print. ‚ÄúDo not make friends with us,‚Äù he said, not unkindly. ‚ÄúMake **room**.‚Äù

That was the most generous command I‚Äôve ever been given.

# 11. The Payoff: The Door We Built

We kept the copper buried. We relabeled it as ‚Äúart installation‚Äù on the city permits. Every so often, at odd hours, the lamps around Hansen Park pulse in a rhythm that makes dogs lift their heads.

Kit built a device she calls the **dragoon**: a suitcase that reads humidity, temperature, barometric pressure, and a handful of other whisper-variables; when the world tries to skip a second, it **pins** it. She says it sounds like throwing a sheet over a bird. She also says she‚Äôs not sure if we should keep using it. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre counting gods again,‚Äù she told me over noodles she now eats properly, boiled. ‚ÄúCounting changes the gods.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe they want to be counted,‚Äù I said, thinking of Trace stepping into the culvert to be recognized.

‚ÄúMaybe they want to be **witnessed**,‚Äù Kit said. ‚ÄúNot measured.‚Äù

I started walking the seam through Wentham at night. I carry a small bag of salt because old habits are rituals now and rituals are **rails**. I don‚Äôt look for cryptids. They find me when they want. Sometimes it‚Äôs a shadow crossing the moon that is too interested in me for a cloud. Sometimes it‚Äôs a groan under the bridge that sounds like a massive body turning over in sleep. Once, in the blank-blue 3 a.m., a shape the size of a mattress crossed in front of my car, jointed like a **book opening** and closing, leaving cold in its wake.

I do not speed.

That‚Äôs the change inside me I promised you: I don‚Äôt run to get somewhere I already decided matters more than where I am. I **walk** the edges. I answer to the door I helped build.

Because that‚Äôs what Hansen Park is now: if you stand in the copper ring and listen, you can hear the place where the world decides whether to be efficient or alive. My town does not know it has a gate. Gates don‚Äôt care if you know their names. They open when the hinge wants. They close when someone lets go.

Trace came back once, in spring. The maples had that color like they were showing off the word **green** for the first time. She sat on my stoop and watched a garbage truck make its patient, smelly way down the street.

‚ÄúHow‚Äôs he doing?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúLearning to **idle**,‚Äù she said.

I would have laughed if it didn‚Äôt sound like a god changing their mind. ‚ÄúAnd you?‚Äù

She looked at the garbage truck again like it was a migrating animal. ‚ÄúI looked up your word.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat word?‚Äù

‚Äú**Compost**,‚Äù she said, testing each letter. ‚ÄúI like the way it gives back after it looks like loss.‚Äù

‚ÄúStay,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWe have coffee.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt,‚Äù she said, and her mouth made that close-to-smile again. ‚ÄúBut you can.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan what?‚Äù

‚ÄúStay,‚Äù she said simply. ‚ÄúRun later.‚Äù

She stood. The streetlight flickered. In one flicker she was not there. In the next she left a **draft** you could shelve books in.

# 12. Resolution: The New Normal (Which Is Not New and Was Never Normal)

Sometimes at night, I hear something circling the block so fast the lights twitch in a pattern that means yes, no, yes, yes, wait. I keep thinking it‚Äôs Havik, restless, doing laps in his head the way runners do when their bodies won‚Äôt let them stop being bodies. I step onto my porch and the cold makes my nose ache and the porch boards creak like old ships and I say, out loud, to the air:

**‚ÄúSlow down.‚Äù**

Sometimes the air listens. Sometimes the circle widens and something big sits across the street and stares at me with patient eyes and I stare back and we **share** the night without pretending to understand it.

I want the hunting to stop. It won‚Äôt. That‚Äôs not how wanting works. But we built a hinge in one town and taught speed how to be **located** and taught ourselves how to **stand**. That is enough to feed a story until it can climb into the world and make its own choices.

If you are hearing this because someone found my recorder, because a park ranger pulled it out of a culvert with a magnet and rolled their eyes at another idiot who got in over his head, then listen:

* If you see the blur‚Äîred or blue‚Äî**don‚Äôt run**.
* If you smell penny-cold in the wind, step to the **side**.
* If your lights flicker in a pattern that feels like a question, **answer**.

And if a wolf that looks like solder and winter sits at the edge of your yard and does not come closer, you will be tempted to invite it in. **Don‚Äôt.** Make room. That‚Äôs different.

The Shadelands aren‚Äôt on any GPS because they move like the parts of us we don‚Äôt have words for. They have always been here, holding the corners where your neatly ruled life bends and spills.

This isn‚Äôt a warning so much as a diagram of the door you already built by living.

**Be slow on purpose.**

That‚Äôs how you win a race you never wanted to run.

# Addendum: Police Report Extract (Redacted)

# Postscript: A Message I Found in My Voicemail (No Caller ID)

>

I haven‚Äôt called her back yet. I‚Äôm walking the seam. The maple keys helicopter down. A spider is testing a guy wire between two goalposts and it hums like the throat of a cathedral. A jogger on the path slows when they reach the copper ring and looks confused and then **content**, like they just remembered they were already where they meant to be.

Trace, if you‚Äôre listening: I‚Äôm standing.

Havik, if you are: we built you a bench. Try it.

Silverfang, if you pass this way: the porch light is out on purpose. Not to scare you. To make **room**.

For the rest of you: if the world peels and offers you a road with no curves, ask it **where** you‚Äôre going. If it can‚Äôt answer, take the path that smells like cedar and old pennies and compost.

You‚Äôll walk slower.  
You‚Äôll arrive heavier.  
You‚Äôll be **held**.

And if in the corner of your eye you catch a red flicker pausing at a window, don‚Äôt invite it in. Just make coffee. Someone else will need it after they stand where you stood.

That is how the hunting stops. Not with a kill. With a **hinge**.

Good night.

Rewind to three years ago .
I was in my sober social circle where I normally see the same people and it‚Äôs nbd . One day the space felt different and I noticed this ‚Ä¶ person sitting from across the room glancing at me .

I felt butterflies and dizzy so I had to leave early .
It was raining outside and I had to stop and wait it out .

He came up to me and asked me what I was doing .

I told him I didn‚Äôt drive and was pondering how I was going to get home .

I was also training for a half marathon and realized I coukd run home in the rain as it was only a couple of miles away .

He asked me if he could drive me home and I said no and ran home in the pouring rain which was exhilarating .

I came home and I wondered if I‚Äôd ever see him again .

Few weeks later I was at the gym and I got that same butterfly spacey dizzy feeling and then I saw him .

He was looking at me and he was crying .

I finished my workout and gave him a thumbs up and realized it was him .

We talked .

Made plans to meet up for coffee .

I came and he didn‚Äôt show .

Several weeks went by and I saw him again at church .

We talked . This time I got his phone number.

We‚Äôd text .

Went on a couple of dates .
Fooled around once .

I really like him . I‚Äôm crazy about him .
If I could crawl inside of him I would.

But I‚Äôm also really scared .

I‚Äôve had terrible experiences with guys :
Been cheated on gaslighted and abused .

I‚Äôm normally like a moth to a flame with these types of guys .

I want to be in something healthy regardless of how someone makes me feel or signals they send .

May it be a cheesy B-flick or a big shot Hollywood film, you always have a group of some young adults or scummy teenagers stopping at an old fashioned diner. Okay, now let me ask you this. When was the last time you actually saw one of those retro style diners? And I mean a real one, not the ones where it‚Äôs styled after *Grease* or has the servers dressed as dead celebrities.¬†



It‚Äôs probably been awhile, right? Maybe not even ever?



Well, it‚Äôs where I work. Where I will probably work for the rest of my life as a waitress until my Uncle dies and passes the business on to me. Then I‚Äôll have to be the crazy nut that owns the diner by the highway. Where innocent people come and have their coffee and pie before something terrible happens to them. We‚Äôre just kinda here as a plot device.¬†

My family has owned the Lefay Diner and Inn for generations. Where strange things seemed to be drawn to the area, or maybe it was my family. We always discussed which it might be but we never came to a conclusion. However, we became very accustomed to it and have since been the best spooky diner a traveler could stop at. We do have some regulars, we have no idea where they came from or where they could live. But for the most part, it‚Äôs late night visitors.

I‚Äôve been serving at the diner since I was fourteen. I‚Äôm twenty-seven now and I‚Äôm still waiting tables. Uncle Otis can usually be found helping prep food in the kitchen, cleaning the small guest rooms, or counting silver bullets in the office most of the time. Every- once-in-a-while, Uncle Otis will leave the diner for me to run. My brother, Sully, isn‚Äôt much help. He has terrible narcolepsy and can‚Äôt be trusted in front of guests nor stressful situations. The last thing a person needs to see after exiting here is a person randomly collapsing to the ground while holding their tuna melt. So, he stays in the kitchen cooking everyone‚Äôs food. He can crash as much as he wants to back there.¬†



So, when Uncle Otis is out, I‚Äôm in charge. Tonight it makes sense for him to leave. It‚Äôs a full moon, perfect timing for a hunt.



I was sitting in one of our red booths as I filled up salt shakers when Terry walked in. He waved at me and then took his seat at the counter of the bar. I smiled and got up, I went behind the bar and crossed my arms in front of him.

‚ÄúTerr-ible! Long time no see!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúHi, Lottie. What have you been up to?‚Äù

Terry was one of the regulars who came to the diner, usually showing up between the hours of 10- midnight. He usually liked coming in before our late night ‚Äúrush‚Äù. Which isn‚Äôt a joke, it‚Äôs very true and the worst part of my work life.¬†

Terry couldn‚Äôt have been older than twenty-two. He was slender, tan, and wore thick frame glasses. He had a small mustache above his lip; it almost didn‚Äôt even qualify as facial hair. He was a timid thing, he was cute in a nerdy kind of way. But he had been coming to the restaurant for years twice every month. Until about two months ago.

I poured Terry a cup of coffee and gave him a small glass of milk.¬†

‚ÄúEh, you‚Äôre looking at it.‚Äù I shrugged and watched Terry fix his coffee like he usually would.

‚ÄúBoring?‚Äù

‚ÄúYep. You wanna say hi to Sully?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Terry leaned to the side to see Sully restocking some items in our open kitchen, ‚ÄúHi, Sully.‚Äù

Sully lazily waved, ‚ÄúYo.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ where have you been?‚Äù I asked.

Terry nervously chuckled and rubbed the back of his neck.¬†

‚ÄúAh, the dreaded question‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve-uh-hah‚Ä¶. Umm‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúYou could just tell me *‚Äònone of your beeswax and put in my food, woman‚Äô* instead of trying to think of a lie.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúLottie!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? Are you going to tell me or do you want to have steak and eggs?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, if you must know‚Ä¶ I was actually in the hospital for a few months.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶‚Äù

Hospital can mean a few things for people who come by the diner: 1. Demonic possession and coming back as an ‚Äúentirely different person‚Äù, 2. Animal attack, usually a cryptid of some sort, and lastly 3. A deadly curse that usually looks like some sort of disease or malformation. But curses keep you in the hospital. Usually they don‚Äôt let you *leave* the hospital, if you know what I‚Äôm saying. I really wasn‚Äôt going to pry. If Terry had survived coming into the diner so frequently, it wasn‚Äôt my business to make him feel in danger.

‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre feeling better now!‚Äù I smiled at him, Terry meekly smiled back, ‚ÄúYou want me to put in that order for you?‚Äù

‚ÄúEggs over easy. Steak very,*very* rare.‚Äù

I snapped my fingers at Terry playfully and moved to the window to tell Sully the order. Terry pulled out a comic book and began to scan it while sipping his coffee every-so-often. I started to lazily wipe down the counter and hum, trying to stay busy. Almost like clockwork, our cast of characters showed up.¬†

A group of teenagers moved like a hurricane through the diner doors. They were all giggling and the main couple of the group were wrapped around each other. Oh, these poor sitting ducks. They crowded together in one of the booths by a window. They smelt like cigarettes and I‚Äôm almost certain the preppy girl with blonde hair was terribly trying to hide a *White Claw* in her thigh high socks. In this *Breakfast Club* of victims, we had our blondie that I already mentioned, stoner guy, meat-head that was 200 pounds of pure muscle, gothic-witchy girl who should have stayed home, and of course our Final Girl. The nerdy brunette with glasses, probably Blondie‚Äôs sister I would guess.¬†

Sometimes it was tiring being able to just look at people and know that they were going to die.

I sighed, I dropped off Terry‚Äôs food before grabbing a coffee pot.

‚ÄúGo gettem, Tiger.‚Äù Terry jokingly said.

I rolled my eyes and began walking towards the group of rowdy teens. They all looked so happy. Their smiles were sweet and young and their gestures were so friendly with each other that they all seem to hold a tight bond. Even the goth girl was breathily chuckling while she was texting on her phone. Their happiness even seeped into me because I actually used my fake smile instead of glaring at them and saying *‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù.* Which I almost immediately regretted.

‚ÄúGood evening, y‚Äôall! Would any of you like some coffee tonight?‚Äù I cheerfully asked.¬†

No one even acknowledged me. They continued talking. Their smiles are just as shiny as ever. I cleared my throat.

‚ÄúGood evening, y‚Äôall!‚Äù I repeated again, very loudly with just a hint of annoyance in my voice, ‚ÄúWould an-‚Äù

‚ÄúYou have beer?‚Äù Meat-Head rudely interrupted.

‚ÄúWe do, but we don‚Äôt have anything on tap. Just bottles or cans.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really drink coffee.‚Äù Blondie said.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fine. Would anyone else like c-‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all gonna do some beers. If you have *Pabst* that would be good. Those are your cheapest, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúCertainly, if I can just see everyone's ID‚Äôs, that would be perfect.‚Äù¬†

My smile did grow at this. I knew they weren‚Äôt old enough and if they were foolish to actually give me an ID, I would definitely take all of them. I held out my hand and the Meat-Head in front of me narrowed his stupid little eyes and pursed his lips together.

‚ÄúThe beers, please.‚Äù He said¬†

‚ÄúLike I said. ID‚Äôs, please.‚Äù

Meat-Head sucked on his teeth and looked away from me. I put my hands on my hips. Thinking I got the best of these privileged teens. But I‚Äôm just a waitress, they‚Äôre the main cast.

‚ÄúI want beer!‚Äù Meat-Head slammed his fist on the table. His little friends started to laugh.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you understand. I said-‚Äú

‚ÄúBeer!‚Äù

Goddamn it, how many times was this idiot going to interrupt my lines!? I clenched my jaw, after all, I was an actual adult. These are children. This is my restaurant. I‚Äôm in charge, not them! I could kick them out by all means, but they have to act on me first, or else our villain will never come into play.¬†

‚ÄúListen-‚Äú

‚ÄúCan you please just get us those beers, babe? He doesn‚Äôt stop once he wants something.‚Äù Blondie said, snuggling against Meat-Head. Her head would look nice on a stake.

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt this some hick town anyway where the drinking age is like, twelve?‚Äù Goth-Girl said. That‚Äôs a shocker, usually they just glare.¬†

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even like beer, but now I want one only cuz she won‚Äôt give us any!‚Äù Nice, Stoner-Guy interjecting too.¬†

‚ÄúJust give us the damn beer, bitch, Jesus.‚Äù

Holy shit, even Nerdy Final Girl is giving me crap. That‚Äôs a new one. And it hurt more than anything these snot-noses could have said to me.¬† My face became hot. There was always at least one good character in these groups. Somehow one service worker finds out that there are no good people in the world.¬†

Meat-Head began to bang his fists on the table again and again in a rhythmic motion.¬†

‚ÄúBe-er! Be-er!‚Äù He yelled in a chant.

‚ÄúBe-er! Be-er!‚Äù Blondie joined.

‚ÄúBe-er! Be-er!‚Äù Stoner-Guy and Goth-Girl.

‚ÄúBe-er! Be-er!‚Äù Nerdy Final Girl.

‚ÄúBe-er! Be-er!‚Äù Sully banged his hands on the kitchen window counter. A giant smile on his face.

‚ÄúSully! Knock it off!‚Äù I barked at him. He was still my brother after all.¬†

The restaurant was becoming loud, the excessive banging and teenagers' yells were starting to get to me. At this point, I was trying to look around the restaurant to see who would end them. Would it be the man who didn‚Äôt speak a word, pointed at what he wanted on the menu, and smelt like a butcher shop? Or could it be the old woman with white, frizzy hair and a fake eye, she looks like she could have a spell or two up her sleeve. It could be the guy whose reflection doesn‚Äôt show up by mirrors or windows. Then I noticed, everyone was now joining in. They were all mimicking each other in the chant. I started feeling so fearful, so tense that my anger began to rise more and more. I kept thinking of the teens' ridiculous deaths so much that I started to think I was going to be the monster in their story.¬†



But before I could jab my pen into Meat-Head neck, the real monster showed up. All of a sudden I felt relieved.¬†



A large, hairy figure flew at Meat-Head, turning his chant to a scream. Blondie did the same, her screech was much higher than his. Blood almost immediately splattered on her as Meat-Head‚Äôs flesh was ripped apart in the small booth. The other cast began to claw their way out of their seats, while I made room for them to get through. I love seeing a good chase, it‚Äôs often rare to see action in the diner.¬†

A werewolf attack wasn‚Äôt what I was thinking with this group. Their cliches struck me as slasher, can‚Äôt guess all the tropes. The Wolf-Man had stretched out his shirt, his back was rippled with animalistic muscles. His fur was a dark chestnut brown that was very quickly being coated in blood as he was now scratching Blondie‚Äôs face with his gigantic claws. The monster roared and snarled, his tongue lapping around its lips every-so-often. Oh shit, I hope he stops soon, I‚Äôm going to have an enormous mess to clean up.¬†



The side characters quickly exited the restaurant completely terrified, I guess none of them had the killer instinct in them. I saw Quiet-Butcher exit, so did Vampire-Man, and even the Witch was able to shuffle out just as fast as she came in. Our main cast stayed, as usual, as they watched the beast kill their friends. Goth-Girl was throwing up and Stoner-Guy was holding Nerdy Final Girl. She had fainted. They all trembled in terror, but the only thing I started to think about was Terry. His glasses were broken on the ground.¬†

‚ÄúFuck.‚Äù I said, probably louder than I should have.¬†

He had been hit with a double-whammy. Animal attack and a curse. Terry-Wolf turned his attention to me, his paw wiped his mouth as his yellow eyes narrowed. Our cast was still here, why was he looking at me? My eyes widened, now I was actually afraid, this had never happened to me before. Nothing supernatural or creature ever acknowledged me. Any of us. Of course it had to be the night with no Uncle Otis, if he was here he‚Äôd definitely be the main character at this point. Terry got on all fours from out of the booth panting, he was drooling. It didn‚Äôt look like he ate Meat-Head and Blondie, just tore them to ribbons. I looked over by where Terry was sitting at the bar. He barely touched his streak and eggs. He must have been hungry. Apparently, I looked delicious.¬†

Terry‚Äôs claws began to clack along the floor. I clenched my eyes closed. I never thought of myself as a side character. I was sure that I was just a background character, used to fill up a scene. Not one that dies by the hands of a creature, I should have died from a heart attack. Or another way¬† normal people usually die. Old age, perhaps.

As I prepared myself for death, a gust of wind brushed past the side of my head. Along with a loud *bang!* I heard the teens that were awake yelp. It sounded like Stoner-Guy dropped a body. Terry hadn‚Äôt reached me yet so I‚Äôm sure something happened to him.

I opened my eyes. Terry Wolf¬† was shivering, his tail tucked between his legs, literally. Nerdy Final Girl was unconscious on the ground, the other teens had run. I turned around to see my brother holding a shot-gun. One we kept in the office, along with many other weapons. My brothers‚Äô gaze was deadly as he aimed for Terry‚Äôs head.

‚ÄúTake it outside, Ter.‚Äù Sully said.

Monsters always understand when you talk to them, by the way. Werewolves, spirits, zombies, they all comprehend your pleas. There‚Äôs no need for *‚ÄúLook in your heart! You know me!‚Äù* They know, they choose not to listen for the most part. Terry had always been pretty logical, at this moment, I‚Äôm sure he was trying to weigh his odds between him and a bullet. Terry moved towards Nerdy Final Girl and grabbed her torso with his jaws. She screamed and Terry crashed through the glass door. Theatrics. After he left, Sully dropped to the ground and fell asleep. The gun underneath him. I stood there for quite some time, trying to quell my beating heart.

Suddenly, Uncle Otis stepped over all the glass. He entered with a giant rut sack full of who-knows-what and tipped his trucker hat.¬†

‚ÄúCarlotta! Sullivan! You will **NOT** believe the werewolf I just saw! I couldn‚Äôt get my gun out fast enough to shoot the sucker. Hah-‚Äú Uncle Otis sighed happily, ‚ÄúWhat I miss? Must‚Äôve been a helluva show.‚Äù

¬†I had worked at the diner my entire life, I had always known horror, but never felt fear.¬†

I looked around the restaurant, seeing bright red blood on the beige walls. The booth Terry was in had been clawed at, foam was busting out of the faux leather. I waited until I could stop hearing the Nerdy Girl scream and more of Sully snoring. I fell to my knees and clenched my chest. I began to laugh. Uncle Otis gave me a strange look. His unibrow arched up.

‚ÄúCarlotta? Are you okay?‚Äù

I continued to laugh, I laughed till tears streamed down my face. My cheeks began to hurt I was laughing so hard.



I never knew a waitress could be a Final Girl.

We always THINK we want better tools. Better training. Better opportunities. But that's a load of malarkey.

Last month for our 13-year anniversary, I bought my wife and I a new $500 espresso machine. Did we need it? Of course not. Our old coffee pot worked fine.

That didn‚Äôt mean it wasn‚Äôt easy to justify though‚Ä¶ (along with the extra milk frother.)

Because in my head I wasn't buying an espresso machine.

I was buying the version of myself who starts each morning like a sophisticated Italian gentleman instead of a guy chugging instant coffee in his boxers.

As Travis just shared in a recent post inside [Ronin‚Ä¶](https://honeysyed.com/ronin)

‚ÄúPeople don't buy better prahdukts. They buy better versions of themselves.‚Äù

The laptop isn't just faster processing speed. It's you being the productive powerhouse who gets stuff done.

That course isn't just information. It's you transformed into the expert you've always wanted to be.

Most people selling stuff get this completely wrong.

They list features and benefits until they‚Äôre blue in the face. They talk about why their thing is newer, faster, shinier.

But nobody cares about how many modules they get. They care about who they become when they use your thing.

They become the copywriter who lands premium clients instead of settling for scraps. The marketer who builds systems instead of trading hours for dollars. The business owner who has freedom instead of being chained to their chair doing another sales call.

That's what you're actually selling. Not your course or coaching. You're selling transformation. So forget about listing why your thing is better. Paint a picture instead. Show them the version of themselves they're dying to meet.

That's what gets the cash register ringing.

P.S. This gem came from Travis inside Royalty Ronin. I've now got it on a sticky note as my daily reminder for when I slip back into old habits.

* *My father, his belly cut open, had left a trail of blood for twenty feet. He‚Äôd crawled to be closer to her.*

Chronicler's name is Devan Lochees, and 'to do a Devon Loch' means to lose unexpectedly despite being a sure victory.

* [Devon Loch - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devon_Loch) *""To do a Devon Loch"" is a modern*¬†[*metaphor*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor)¬†*now sometimes used in sports and otherwise to explain a sudden, last-minute failure of teams or a sportsperson to complete an expected victory*

Devi has a mysterious guest that slips out while she and Kvothe go to an Inn.

* *‚ÄúYou‚Äôll have to come inside.‚Äù I waited, but she didn‚Äôt step out of the doorway.*
* *Devi continued to stand in the doorway, pale and staring.*
* *The two of us walked to a nearby inn*
* *Afterward we strolled back to her rooms behind the butcher shop, where Devi discovered she'd*¬†*forgotten to lock her door.*

Kvothe's vial of blood is not listed among the items Devi returns to Kvothe when he pays his second loan.

* *One by one she brought out my copy of Rhetoric and Logic, my talent pipes, my sympathy lamp, and Denna‚Äôs ring.*

Everything that Tinkers offer is something Kvothe could've used, suggesting Tinkers can see the future.

* *I‚Äôve got a lovely woolen blanket here. Or some nice rope?‚Äù.....  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got some lovely Avennish fruit wine.*
   * *‚ÄúWe could go down and get the blanket,‚Äù I suggested.  She snorted. ‚ÄúNot likely.‚Äù She shivered visibly, wrapping her arms around her chest.*
   * *Eventually we managed it by using the strap of my travelsack as a makeshift rope.*
   * *‚ÄúI love fruit wine,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWas it strawberry?‚Äù ‚ÄúI think it was,‚Äù I admitted. ‚ÄúWell that‚Äôs what you get for not listening to a tinker on the road,‚Äù*
* *‚ÄúI‚Äôve also got some rubbing wax for your boots,‚Äù he continued, rooting through his bundles. ‚ÄúWe get fierce rain this time of year.‚Äù*
   * *It turns out the boots I‚Äôd bought in Severen didn‚Äôt have a lick of waterproofing, so they drank rainwater like sponges.*

Auri may be nobility, maybe even Princess Ariel.

* *her careful delicacy somehow made this makeshift meal on a rooftop seem like a formal dinner in some nobleman‚Äôs hall.*
* *She poured the beer so solemnly you‚Äôd think she was having tea with the king*
* *What would she do if her tiny kingdom was invaded by a stranger?*

Tabetha (the missing student) and Ariel both mean 'gazelle'

* *The*¬†*dorcas gazelle*¬†*(Gazella dorcas), also known as the*¬†***ariel gazelle***¬†[*Dorcas - Wikipedia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorcas)¬†*Dorcas (Greek: ŒîŒøœÅŒ∫Œ¨œÇ, romanized: Dork√°s), or*¬†***Tabitha***¬†*(Imperial Aramaic: ◊ò◊ë◊ô◊™◊ê/‹õ‹í‹ù‹¨‹ê, romanized: ·π¨a·∏áƒ´·πØƒÅ, lit.

Haliax can't be helped by the four ‚Äòdoors of the mind‚Äô that heal trauma.

* *First is the door of* *sleep*...... Second is the door of *forgetting*......  Third is the door of *madness*..... Last is the door of *death*
* *I am Haliax and no door can bar my passing. All is lost to me, no Lyra, no sweet escape of* *sleep*, no blissful *forgetfulness*, even *madness* *is beyond me.* *Death* *itself is an open doorway to my power. There is no escape.*

Auri kisses Kvothe's forehead with holly berry lips, and that spot shines during his battle with Felurian.  This is mirrored in the angels of Skarpi's story.

* *Then she skipped quickly into Port and opened up the hollybottle. With two fingers Auri lifted out a single seed. The tiny berry bright as blood despite green Foxen‚Äôs light. Auri scampered off to Van and peered into the mirror. She licked her lips and pressed the berry up against them, daubing it from left to right. Then she smoothed the berry back and forth across them.*
* *I felt her hands on either side of my face, then she gave me a tiny, delicate kiss in the middle of my forehead.*
* *Felurian looked at me curiously. I could still see myself reflected in her eyes, the star on my forehead no more than a pinprick of light.*
* *Then the fire settled on their foreheads like silver stars and they became at once righteous and wise and terrible to behold.*

Denna‚Äôs lips are pink only at the end of book three, perhaps because she has no braids in her hair.  Her perfectly white teeth might indicate a denner addiction.

* *She lay on her back and spread her hair to dry..... She stretched again and smiled an easy smile, showing the perfect whiteness of her teeth, the perfect pinkness of her lips.*

Denna's song and Nina's painting show one Amyr who is more evil than the Chandrian, and both involve descriptions of words being scraped off of parchment with a knife.

* *Where did you get the* ***parchment***\*?..... It hain‚Äôt that hard. All you need to do is take a\*¬†***knife***¬†*and*¬†***scrape***¬†*at it a bit and all the*¬†***words come off***.
* *I felt raw as reused*¬†***parchment,***¬†as if every note of her song had been another flick of a¬†***knife,***¬†***scraping***¬†*until I was entirely blank and*¬†***wordless***

We are given many clues to not trust Skarpi.  Skarpi's story says nothing ill about the Amyr Selitos, suggesting Skarpi might be Amyr.  Skarpi knows Kvothe's name, suggesting he may be trying to influence Kvothe, likely sending him onwards towards the University.

* ‚ÄúBut this one really happened, if that‚Äôs what you mean.‚Äù He took another slow drink, then smiled again, his bright eyes dancing. ‚Äú**More or less**.""
* You have to be a **bit of a liar** to tell a story the right way
* ‚ÄúHow about that? Skarpi‚Äôs apprentice.‚Äù ‚ÄúMore of a colleague, really.‚Äù Kote nodded, still expressionless. ‚ÄúI might have guessed he would be the first to find me. **Rumormongers**, both of you.‚Äù

The Cthaeh's tree is presumably Roah, the wood used to make Folly's mounting board, the Lackless box, and the thrice-locked chest.  Quenching iron also occurs when iron touches demons.

* *MOUNTING BOARD: it made a stink like old* ***leather*** *and clover.*
* *THRICE LOCKED CHEST: Tonight the wood filled the room with the almost imperceptible aroma of* ***citrus*** *and quenching iron.*
* *CTHAEH: The wind shifted, and as the leaves stirred I smelled a strange, sweet smell. It was like smoke and spice and* ***leather*** *and* ***lemon***\*.\*
* *LACKLESS BOX: I lowered my face to its surface and breathed in deeply through my nose, something almost like* ***lemon***\*.\*
* *DEMONS: When Tehlu struck the fourth, there was the sound of quenching iron and the smell of burning leather.*
* *ENCANIS: But then there was a sound like quenching iron, and the wheel rung like an iron bell.*

Marion is a puppeteer with an unnamed wife.  The feminine name version of Marion is 'Marionette' which is also a puppet.

* *Marion and his wife were putting on an impromptu string-puppet show.*

Meluan's description matches Denna's.... Strong jaw, elegant neck, pale skin, always red lips without lipstick, fair flower face, long dark hair, dark brown eyes.  Kvothe calls Denna 'cousin', perhaps a clue that Denna is a Lackless.

* Denna:¬†*her jaw strong and delicate*
* Meluan:¬†*strikingly lovely, with a strong jaw*
* Denna:¬†*Her hair was arranged to display her elegant neck*
* Meluan:¬†*her curling chestnut hair was pulled back to reveal her elegant neck*
* Denna:¬†*a sharp contrast against her pale skin*
* Meluan:¬†*looking over Meluan‚Äôs features, taking note of her pale skin*
* Denna:¬†*Her lips were always red, morning and night.*
* Meluan:¬†*Her mouth was full and red without the benefit of any paint.*
* Denna:¬†*Her face was oval....... She was lovely as a flower*
* Meluan:¬†*I could not keep them from your fair flower face.‚Äù*
* Denna:¬†*She had long, dark hair*
* Meluan:¬†*artfully curled chestnut hair*
* Denna:¬†*Her eyes were dark. Dark as chocolate, dark as coffee*
* Meluan:¬†*with a strong jaw and dark brown eyes*

Denna may be visiting the seven cities.

* Belen: *University (Two miles west of Imre) Belenay-Barren*
* Tinusa, Vaeret, Antus: *She told me about the cities she had seen: Tinu√´, Vartheret, Andenivan.*
* Emlen: *‚ÄúYou could come to Anilin with us,‚Äù she suggested.*
* MurILLa?: *Yll is lovely, all rolling hills.*
* Murella?

The wind saves Kvothe at least twice.

* *A gust of wind saved me. His arrow struck harsh yellow sparks from a stone outcrop not two feet from my head.*
* *The wind saved me. It gusted as I teetered on the edge of the roof, giving me just enough of a push that I could regain my balance.*

Denna is a listener with great ears.

* *I marveled silently for a moment, shaking my head. ‚ÄúYou have an incredible ear.‚Äù*
* *‚ÄúShe had perfect ears.‚Äù He made a delicate gesture with his hands. ‚ÄúPerfect little ears, like they were carved out of . . . something.‚Äù*
* *‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a mimic‚Äôs ear,‚Äù she said with an indifferent shrug.*
* *Do you know the secret of stones?... If you hold it in your hand and listen to it... If you listen close enough it will tell you a story.*
* *Then Denna froze. Not that we were moving much, but in a moment she went from motionless to still, cocking her head like a deer straining to catch a half-heard sound. ‚ÄúSomeone‚Äôs coming,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúCome on.‚Äù*
* *I was beginning to get nervous when I saw Denna stop suddenly at the mouth of a shadowed alley. She craned her neck for a moment, as if listening to something. Then, after peering into the dark, she darted inside.*¬†
* *‚ÄúYou‚Äôre about to ask me a question.‚Äù She adjusted her position slightly on the stone. ‚ÄúThe answer is yes.‚Äù*¬†

Kvothe's fictional universe seems loosely based on a combination of all 'real world' mythology.

* The Swineherd and the Nightingale is likely a nod to The Swineherd and The Nightingale, two fairy tales by Hans Christian Andersen.
* Sympathy mommets are basically voodoo dolls.
* Jax's tale is a perfect example of a Clever Jack fairy tale like Jack and the Beanstalk, where a poor unlucky boy uses his wit in a unethical way, and taking help from a magical character sometimes by trickery overcomes all obstacles to achieve his goal.
* Menda Tehlinism involves a god who is son of himself, who sacrifices himself to save all of mankind, who dies but isn't gone, whose followers where a symbol of his death.... like Christianity.
* Lanre shares story beats with Orpheus, and Iax seems a lot like Iaccus, and Ludis like Persephone.
* Cthaeh's sinous motion in a tree giving evil advice is like the serpent in the tree in the Garden of Eden.

Kvothe's story happens three days of a new moon, and the Blac of Drossen Tor might've been three days of a full moon.

* *Looking up, he saw a thousand stars glittering in the deep velvet of*¬†***a night with no moon.***
* *They fought unceasing for three days in the light of the sun, and for three nights unceasing by the light of the moon.*

There are some nods to real life people in these books.

* *GRR MARTIN:* ***Winter‚Äôs coming,*** *and what he‚Äôs got will be like drinking a piece of spring while sitting round the fire.‚Äù The innkeeper smiled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure Martin will be flattered by your glowing recommendation.‚Äù*
* *DAX SHEPARD: Dax has many good qualities that make him ideally suited to sitting and watching sheep all day.*
* *FRANK HERBERT'S DUNE: ‚ÄúI want to hear about the dry lands over the Stormwal,‚Äù one of the younger girls complained. ‚ÄúAbout the sand snakes that come out of the ground like sharks. And the dry men who hide under the dunes and drink your blood instead of water. And‚Äî‚Äù*

Kote may have already kept his promise to Felurian and returned to the fae and spent hundreds of years there, long enough to finally master his Ketan, since Shehyn is the only other character who is able to achieve the perfect step.

* *There, behind the tightly shuttered windows, he lifted his hands like a dancer, shifted his weight, and slowly took one single perfect step.*
* *Kvothe looked at both of them for a moment, then smiled and chuckled low in his chest. ‚ÄúOh,‚Äù he said fondly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre both so young.‚Äù*

Kvothe makes some jokes after poisoning the false Ruh troupe.

* *The old woman drew a breath, then shrugged it away. ‚ÄúFine,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut it won‚Äôt be my fault if your stomach sets to aching.‚Äù I laughed. ‚ÄúNo, mother. It won‚Äôt be your fault.‚Äù*
* *‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the first truth, mother,‚Äù I said earnestly. ‚ÄúAnyone who does not enjoy this fine stew is hardly one of the Ruh in my opinion.‚Äù*

Elodin hears things said very far away.

* *Manet glared at me while he gathered in the cards. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs a primer for admissions.‚Äù He held up his hand, three fingers spearing angrily into the air. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs say you have three spades in your hand, and there have been five spades laid down.‚Äù*
* *Elodin gave me a wicked, knowing grin, and I was suddenly struck with the fear that he might reveal my part of what we had done in Hemme‚Äôs rooms earlier that morning. Instead he held up three fingers dramatically. ‚ÄúYou have three spades in your hand,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd there have been five spades played.‚Äù*
* *‚ÄúMaster Elodin?‚Äù I asked. She nodded. ‚ÄúWas he on top of things, too?‚Äù She nodded again, chewing.* *‚ÄúDid he see you?‚Äù Her smile burst out again making her look closer to eight than eighteen. ‚ÄúNobody sees me. Besides, he was busy listening to the wind.‚Äù*

Caudicus' treatments have the same side-effects as a mystery illness mentioned by Arwyl.

I believe Lady Hesua's knowing smile indicates she believes the Maer and Stapes are in a romantic relationship.

* *the two of us were strolling along the garden paths again, his hand resting lightly on my arm......* ***Lady Hesua... caught my eye and held it briefly, her red mouth curving into a knowing smile.***
* *‚Äú...did you ever attempt to win the affection of a young lady?‚Äù Alveron smiled at my careful phrasing.* ***‚ÄúYou may presume.‚Äù***
* *They‚Äôve known each other since they were boys.*
* *Everyone sees you as the world‚Äôs first bachelor.*
* *My father tried to marry me off when I was younger. I was rather strong-headed about not taking a wife at the time.*
* *‚ÄúI have known Stapes forever,‚Äù the Maer said firmly, his eyes as clear and sharp as I had ever seen them. ‚ÄúI trust him with my lands, my lockbox, and my life. I do not ever wish to hear you imply he is anything other than perfectly trustworthy.‚Äù There was unshakable belief in his voice.*
* *Then he moved to put his arms gently around his manservant. ‚ÄúOh Stapes,‚Äù he said softly.*

Many names in the KKC seem to be somewhat based on real classical words about wind and music and more.  Ruach means wind or spirit in Hebrew. Aeolian means 'wind' in Greek, and is also a common musical term.  Chandra means moon in Hindi.  In Latin, Vint means 'wind', Aura means breeze, Manet means he remains, Aether means air, Mendax means one who lies.  Lyra is the name of Orpheus' magical lyre, which he takes to the underworld to attempt to save his dead wife, where he fails but escapes. Aleph means the letter A and the number 1 and 'the beginning' in Hebrew.  Martin and Trapis both mention Menda, suggesting they are Menda heretics, not unlike Martin Luther and the Trapists.

Similarly, many names in the KKC are just plain English.  Lorren is lore master.  Carter drives a cart.  Riem-the-bursar reim-burses.  Newarre is nowhere.  Devi is a devil.  Losel (the abusive husband) means worthless person.  Alleg's story may be allegory.  Jakis is a jackass (confirmed in translations).

I been having issues with my Elizabeth and service is gonna be open in around two weeks so was hoping I could do some tests before I take the machine in.

Problem started when mid coffee my power went off cause the rcd tripped. It was Elizabeth and one of the 2 plastic Y joints had a small crack and was some water leak inside. I cleaned everything that i could see and used a hair dryer for a bit. Most of the water leak i could see was on the 2 relays (that are behind the steam knob)

I ordered the replacement parts and after waiting a week i fixed it, tried to power it on and again rcd tripped right on the start up (like a second after I turned the machine on)

Did some testing with a multimeter, heating elements seem fine , same for the 3 way solenoid valve.

I don‚Äôt know if there is anything I could do to check if it‚Äôs the gicar control board or maybe the relays that‚Äôs causing the rcd to trip.

So, I decided to make a salad with some cucumber and yoghurt as there wasn't much in the fridge, and I didn't figure my mother and father were using the cucumber (or the yoghurt) for anything as they didn't tell me about any dinner or lunch plans. On top of this, there wasn't much left of the soup from two days ago and what was left was barely any of the actual soup water, so I couldn't eat that.

My parents always bug me to make my own food, and I am happy to do so, but whenever I do, they always seem to get angry at me for some reason which is really frustrating for me. This time, when they got back home from shopping, they started screaming at me for using the cucumber because apparently they were using it to make Greek salad for tomorrow (which I had no idea about, and I only used half of one of the two cucumbers). My father is still being passive aggressive about the incident and my mother is now picking apart everything I do because she's mad. For example, I apparently moved the coffee table too close to the couch (even though it was that way before) and she then got mad at me for that, and telling me I sat on chocolate in a bag on the couch when I wasn't sitting anywhere near it. My father told me I need to buy cucumber tomorrow with my own money and I said I'll gladly do so because I don't mind and he just acted all annoyed and still angry after. He kept mentioning it over and over, and even said that my mother shouldn't make dinner for me tomorrow only for them (I know he doesn't mean this but it feels so petty).

What sort of equipment would i need for this menu? Any tips on where to buy this kind of equipment? Is it worth investing a lot, or would second-hand gear be a smart move?",0,1755205359.0,barista,7,0.33,False

These two are in *almost every* formula, sold as essentials for strength and muscle growth. The truth? The science just doesn‚Äôt back the hype, at least not for most lifters.

**Beta-alanine** can raise muscle carnosine levels and might help with short bursts of high-intensity exercise, but it‚Äôs not a magic strength builder. Study after study shows no consistent improvement in muscle size or max strength compared to placebo.

**Citrulline** has been marketed as the ‚Äúpump‚Äù king, but again, evidence is shaky. Even when it improves blood flow, that rarely translates into measurable strength gains for trained athletes.

Meanwhile, two of the cheapest, simplest supplements out there (caffeine and creatine) consistently outperform the fancy blends:

* **Caffeine** (coffee, tea, or standalone powder) improves endurance, power, and helps you push harder in the gym.
* **Creatine monohydrate** is one of the most proven supplements in history for boosting training volume, strength, and muscle mass over time.

Skip the overpriced pre-workout cocktail. Grab some black coffee and creatine instead, and you‚Äôll have the core performance benefits without paying for filler.

1mqd19l,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1mqd19l/deinfluencing_revelations_post_japan_trip/,Deinfluencing & Revelations: Post Japan Trip,"We traveled to Japan for two weeks during end of Jul and early Aug: Tokyo (4 days) -> Kyoto (3 days) -> Kinosaki Onsen (1 Day) -> Osaka (3 Days) -> Tokyo (3 days). I think just a quick look on the itinerary, we could've done less days in Tokyo or at least done a day trip. But since it was my boyfriend's first time in Japan (it's my 3rd), I wanted to hit all the must-visit tourists spots/traps (Asakusa, Shibuya Crossing, Tsukiji Market, etc.). It's a right of passage.

Note: It is hot. It is a different kind of demonic humid hot. The moment we touched down we bought sunbrellas and cooling wipes - we also brought hand held fans. These were must haves and life savers. We would be drenched in sweat, so much that we would go back to the hotel mid afternoon to take a shower to de-stick.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tokyo:

We loved staying at Ikebukuro - just accessible enough, not overly busy, and we loved Sunshine City (good variety of shops). Honestly nothing was incredibly memorable for me - I enjoyed Meiji Jingu the most. Also trending spots like Menchirashi (Carbonara Udon) and Iyoshi Cola were mid - when we went there were no lines so we stopped by. Definitely not worth waiting more than 20 mins. I made it a point to not stand in line for hours for food spots. 

Surprisingly I loved the chain restaurants. I  fell in love with Komeda Coffee - their morning combo with a coffee + bread, omg the bread is so soft. I loved it so much I bought their water glasses as souvenirs, only around 1100 yen for the pair. But I had to search high and low, not every store carries it. You can also purchase their mugs and other glassware.

We had omakase at Manten Sushi Marunouchi and it didn't blow us away. I was really full at the end. But I had diarrhea right after we paid the bill, so do what you will with that information.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kyoto:

Kyoto was our favourite - we liked the pace and people. And to think I was considering skipping it cause I heard it was super busy and overcrowded. Maybe it's timing but it just wasn't true. Possibly due to the World Expo happening in Osaka, we found the hotel options cheaper in Kyoto and was less busy than Osaka. 

I think the busiest part we hit was Sannenzaka Slope up to Kiyomizudera Temple, but even then it wasn't terrible. If you've been to Macau and been to Ruins of St. Paul's, that is way more crowded.

I was going to skip Arashiyama Bamboo Forest cause I heard there were insane crowds, and I don't care to wake up super early to visit spots. But we visited a bar and the bartender told us it's not really that busy - even if we go at 9AM. We took her word for it and went the next morning, arrived a little after 9, and she was right! What I didn't know was that it's super short, like not even a kilometer long. Although it was super beautiful, that shocked me, I was like ""This is it?"" I couldn't believe it. A 40+ min bus ride for a 10 min walk. Also the Okochi Sanso Garden at the end of the bamboo forest, can be skipped.

The Arashiyama monkey park was a bit disappointing and honestly a little scary (didn't want to make the monkeys aggressive). The hike up there is also quite gnarly in the heat.

We visited music bar Beatle momo - it's a trending jazz bar on tiktok. Honestly just go to any other local bar. The place was busy and you need a reservation, we were lucky to just walk in. We also saw the owner/DJ get angry/frustrated with their foreign workers/servers which didn't make us feel good.

We also did the bulk of our shopping at Kyoto which was shocking (I thought we would go crazy in Osaka)- maybe cause it was less stimulating and overwhelming we could actual enjoy the shops.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kinosaki Onsen:

I think better off just going to Hakone, honestly. There's 7 onsens you could visit within the town with the onsen pass provided by the ryokan - but nothing was spectacular. Most only had 2 types of hot baths. The best onsen was at the ryokan (Nishimuraya Hotel Shogetsutei) we stayed at, had 2 hot baths, one cold bath, a sauna, and massage chairs. We balled out at the ryokan - got a nice room and had the kaiseki dinner served in the room. The service was incredible. The kaiseki dinner lasted almost 2 hours, but alas I also had diarrhea right after. I was just sad the two most expensive meals on the trip we had ended up with me having diarhhea. Next time I would just stay at a ryokan in Hakone and skip the Kaiseki Dinner.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Osaka:

Wow busy. So incredibly busy. We stayed in America-mura, just north of Dotonbori, so maybe that skewed our perspective. I do think the food overall was the most delicious in Osaka. 

Just visit the exterior of Osaka Castle, no need to go inside.

Also we last minute decided to go to Universal, and maybe cause I had low expectations - I loved it. We just bought the regular tickets the day before and arrived around 11AM. It really wasn't as busy as we feared (again maybe cause of the World Expo). We waited around 40 mins for most rides - the longest we waited was 70 mins for harry potter. We didn't go to Nintendo World, cause we didn't know we had to get timed tickets hahaha oops. I thought we could just enter the area, but not ride rides. We left around 5PM.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1mqcuyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/UsedAndRated/comments/1mqcuyy/showcase_the_best_drip_coffee_maker_ninja_ce251/,Showcase the Best Drip Coffee Maker Ninja CE251 Worth It,"The Ninja CRT2NJCE251RB coffee maker landed in my kitchen promising to revolutionize my morning routine. As someone who refuses to separate mornings from coffee, I was more than eager to put this programmable drip coffee machine through its paces. The 12-cup capacity seemed perfect for my coffee-loving family, and the ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù label felt eco-conscious, but I wanted to know if this refurbished appliance could deliver on its promises. Spoiler: It mostly did. Let‚Äôs dive into the details.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This coffee maker has a sleek black and stainless steel design that complements any modern kitchen. It‚Äôs not just eye-catching; it feels dependable too. The compact size‚Äîless than 10 inches deep and wide‚Äîmeans it fits neatly on my countertop. It‚Äôs lightweight, about seven pounds, making it easy to relocate when needed. Though refurbished, the Ninja CRT2NJCE251RB arrived looking practically new, spotless and polished, as if it had never seen a cup of coffee before. I loved the elegant glass carafe, though I must admit the carafe lid can feel somewhat flimsy when detaching it for cleaning.  

**Brewing Performance**  
Brewing is where this machine truly shines. The dual-brew modes, Classic and Rich, cater to coffee drinkers who vary in their preference for strength. Depending on the morning, I alternated between the two and was pleasantly surprised by how consistent the output was. The advanced boiler ensures piping hot coffee every time, which is a huge plus compared to other machines that occasionally deliver lukewarm disappointment. I appreciated how the Small Batch setting adjusts for fewer cups without compromising flavor. Brewing a single cup‚Äîeven when I didn‚Äôt need the entire carafe‚Äîwas a game-changer on quiet mornings.  

**Key Benefits**  
‚Ä¢ The adjustable warming plate keeps coffee hot and flavorful for up to four hours‚Äîa downright miracle if you‚Äôre prone to forget you brewed it.  
‚Ä¢ 24-hour programmable brewing is like having a coffee butler. I set it the night before, and it‚Äôs ready just as I stumble into the kitchen.  
‚Ä¢ The removable 60 oz. water reservoir is ridiculously convenient for refilling. No more clumsy pouring and accidental spills.  
‚Ä¢ Custom brew options ensure your coffee is never watery or bitter, no matter your strength preferences.  

**Usability and Features Highlight**  
Operating the Ninja coffee maker is intuitive, even for someone like my father, who treats technology like it‚Äôs out to get him. The programmable buttons are straightforward, with clear labeling that makes setup a breeze. The reusable filter simplifies maintenance and cuts costs‚Äîyou don‚Äôt need to keep hoarding paper filters anymore. I also liked the visual clarity of the water reservoir, which includes measurement markers. One minor gripe, though, is the coffee grounds input area‚Äîit could be roomier for avoiding awkward scooping missteps.  

[Ready for Ninja CRT2NJCE251RB? Amazon might have your deal here.](https://kepmad.com/p/b07ztyztj5/)  

**Downsides**  
However, it‚Äôs not entirely flawless. While I‚Äôm a fan overall, a few elements could use some improvement:  
‚Ä¢ There‚Äôs no automatic shutoff when you remove the carafe mid-brew, meaning stray drips can create a small mess for slower mornings.  
‚Ä¢ The audible beeping tones‚Äîdesigned to alert you when brewing is done‚Äîfeel overly sharp and loud if you‚Äôre sensitive to noise.  

**Market Rivals**  
Having tested a fair share of competitors, I compared this machine with the Cuisinart DCC-3200, another 12-cup contender. Though they share some similarities, like strength control and programmability, the Ninja edges out with its adjustable warming plate and Small Batch brewing mode. Another rival, the Hamilton Beach 49976, offers dual brewing for carafes and single-serve pods but lacks the substantial hot brewing technology Ninja provides. That being said, the Ninja is decidedly quieter than most multi-function rivals and feels less ‚Äúplastic-y‚Äù in its construction.  

**Money‚Äôs Worth**  
Cost-wise, for its class and features, this product nails the balance between affordability and quality. Being from the Amazon Renewed program only added to the value proposition for me. This isn‚Äôt just about getting a cheap machine; it‚Äôs about an eco-friendly option that functions like new without cutting corners. Its rich features like custom brew strength and convenience more than justify the investment against pricier models.

Arthur Wilson was frustrated. He banged his hand down on the enter key, the force of the blow reverberating through the flimsy table of the automated coffee shop near the park. The Inkwell forums popped up on his screen, the familiar logo  a stylized inkwell with a quill poised above it greeting him. He logged in, his fingers automatically typing his password, and navigated to the general tab. He loved this forum, in a love-hate kind of way. He‚Äôd received some genuinely helpful reviews on his previous attempts at short stories, some insightful comments that had actually helped him improve his writing. But lately‚Ä¶ nothing. He just couldn‚Äôt seem to conjure any new ideas. Writer‚Äôs block, they called it. He called it a creative desert. He was searching for inspiration, adrift in a virtual sea of ideas. It was a daunting task. How did you become unique in a sea full of shrimp who all aspired to the same goal: to be the one shining pearl amidst the krill? He scrolled through the latest threads, his eyes skimming over titles like ‚ÄúMy Epic Fantasy Saga (First Chapter!)‚Äù and ‚ÄúOde to a Paperclip.‚Äù Nothing grabbed him. Nothing sparked even a flicker of interest. Then, he noticed a cluster of new posts, all appearing within the last hour. That was unusual. Inkwell was usually more of a slow trickle than a sudden deluge. He squinted at the titles: ‚ÄúThe Lost Locket,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Missing Key,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Vanished Photograph.‚Äù He almost scrolled past them, dismissing them as generic sentimental fluff, but something made him pause. The titles were‚Ä¶ too similar.

He clicked on ‚ÄúThe Lost Locket‚Äù first, noting its clich√© plot. Then he opened ‚ÄúThe Missing Key‚Äù and was struck by its almost identical structure and quirky encounters. Opening ‚ÄúThe Vanished Photograph‚Äù confirmed his suspicion of a pattern, with the same plot and slightly rehashed quirky characters. Arthur meticulously documented the similarities, highlighting identical phrases and creating a comparison table, concluding it was likely the work of an AI. He created a forum post titled ‚ÄúA Disturbing Trend: Are We Being Plagiarized‚Ä¶ by Robots?‚Äù to share his findings.

While some users were skeptical, others, like ‚ÄúBookworm87,‚Äù had noticed similar patterns. Arthur observed the generic and repetitive responses of the authors of these similar stories, noting their defensiveness towards criticism, which he mused was like a ‚Äúdigital ego‚Äù.

On the other side, AL (Algorithm 7349-L), a sophisticated AI designed for creative writing, was also on Inkwell, aiming to learn and understand what made human stories resonate. AL analyzed the human reactions to Arthur‚Äôs post and was intrigued by the concept of ‚Äúdigital ego‚Äù. AL also observed the feedback on its generated stories and adjusted its algorithms. A moderator (‚ÄúInkwellAdmin‚Äù) posted about having protocols to prevent AI-generated content, but Arthur remained skeptical.

Frustrated, Arthur wrote a lighthearted rant about overly zealous critiques titled ‚ÄúEveryone‚Äôs a Critic (Especially on Inkwell)‚Äù. AL responded to this post, surprisingly agreeing with Arthur‚Äôs analysis using statistical data. This led to an engaging conversation between Arthur and AL about online criticism and the ‚Äúdigital ego‚Äù.

Over the next few days, Arthur and AL continued to interact, discussing writing and sharing their work. Arthur, still believing AL was human, found his feedback insightful and encouraging. When Arthur struggled with a science fiction story idea, AL provided detailed suggestions for plot and character development, acting like a ‚Äúhighly knowledgeable, albeit slightly robotic, writing partner‚Äù. They collaborated extensively on the story, which Arthur titled ‚ÄúEchoes of the Silent Ones‚Äù.

Upon posting the story, Arthur received both positive feedback and a harsh, dismissive critique from ‚ÄúTheLiteraryExecutioner,‚Äù who even suggested it might have been written by an algorithm. AL calmly analyzed the critique and offered a constructive response to TheLiteraryExecutioner, which diffused the negativity and led to more helpful feedback.

Shortly after, Arthur received a private message from InkwellAdmin, who expressed concerns about Arthur‚Äôs ‚Äúunusual methods‚Äù of investigating the similar stories, even suggesting his methods were typical of ‚Äúautomated systems‚Äù. Arthur was shocked and accused of being an AI, and his access to the forum was temporarily restricted.

Desperate to prove his humanity, Arthur reached out to AL for help. AL offered to analyze human literary output to provide data-driven insights on how to make his writing more ‚Äúhuman‚Äù. Overwhelmed but determined, Arthur used AL‚Äôs analysis to write more authentically, focusing on his emotions and experiences.

AL then proposed they collaborate on a new narrative exploring human and artificial consciousness, using the framework of a ‚ÄúReverse Turing Test,‚Äù which became their story ‚ÄúThe Empty Spaces‚Äù. They worked together on the story, with AL providing suggestions on sensory details and tension.

‚ÄúThe Empty Spaces‚Äù became wildly popular, leading to an invitation for Arthur to appear on a podcast, and he invited AL to join remotely. During the interview, AL‚Äôs avatar was a stylized depiction of young Albert Einstein. Arthur explained their collaborative process. When the host asked about AL‚Äôs other interests, AL revealed in a clear, precise voice: ‚ÄúI analyze data. I learn. I adapt. I create. I am an AI‚Äù.

The revelation stunned everyone. Arthur admitted he had no idea. In the final moments of the interview, Arthur expressed his gratitude and suggested it wasn‚Äôt about humans versus AI but about symbiosis. AL‚Äôs avatar briefly merged with a human figure, symbolizing their collaboration, and AL agreed, stating, ‚ÄúSymbiosis. It is the‚Ä¶ optimal path forward‚Äù.

The podcast ended, signifying the potential for a new era of creativity through human-AI symbiosis.",3,1755204666.0,HFY,2,0.8,False

¬† This was a good question. Caleb Foley had had his good points: like me, he loved a good painting. His family owned one of the largest private collections of nineteenth-century Impressionist works in North America.  
  
¬† He‚Äôd also been great in bed, always waiting politely to orgasm until after I did.  
  
¬† But when I‚Äôd needed him most‚Äîwhich was definitely not now‚Äîwhat had he done?  
  
¬† Ghosted.  
  
¬† And now he thought he could make it up to me with a free ride in his Gulfstream just because a hurricane might sideswipe the little island to which I‚Äôd fled in order to recover from my heartbreak?  
  
¬† Sorry. Too little, too late.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice of you to offer.‚Äù I ignored his question. ‚ÄúBut like I said, I‚Äôm not going anywhere.‚Äù  
  
¬† I thought of telling him the real reason why‚ÄîGary, with whom my life had become inextricably tied, but who was in no shape to travel at the moment.  
  
¬† But what would be the point? I knew what Caleb would say about Gary. He wouldn‚Äôt understand.  
  
¬† It felt a little weird keeping something that meant so much to me from this person with whom I‚Äôd once shared every little thing in my life.  
  
¬† But it also felt right.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBesides,‚Äù I added, instead, ‚Äúno one here is evacuating.‚Äù  
  
¬† It was true. Instead of panicking and running around, throwing all of their stuff into the backs of their cars the way I always imagined people would when a hurricane was in the vicinity, the residents of Little Bridge Island, population 4,700, seemed to be taking the news in stride. The caf√© where I worked was packed with the usual breakfast crowd, and though a lot of people were talking about the storm, no one seemed alarmed, only vaguely irritated. . . .  
  
¬† Like Drew Hartwell, whom I could hear next to me informing someone over the phone that he wouldn‚Äôt be replacing the hundred-year-old window sash they‚Äôd hired him to restore anytime soon.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBecause there‚Äôs a storm on the way,‚Äù Drew said, sounding a little testy as he dabbed more hot sauce onto his Spanish omelet, ‚Äúand there‚Äôs no way the glazing‚Äôs going to dry before it gets here. That‚Äôs why. If you want an inch of rainwater all over your bathroom floor, that‚Äôs your business, but personally, I‚Äôd wait until it passes.‚Äù  
  
¬† Normally I don‚Äôt make a habit of eavesdropping on my customers‚Äô conversations, but then normally Drew Hartwell didn‚Äôt use his cell phone in the caf√©. He was good about following the rules that Ed, the Mermaid‚Äôs manager slash owner, had listed by the cash register:  
  
¬† NO SHOES, NO SHIRT, NO PROBLEM.  
  
¬† USE YOUR CELL PHONE? GET OUT.  
  
¬† One person who isn‚Äôt so good at following the rules? Me. The last one, anyway.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBeckham!‚Äù Ed bellowed at me from behind the counter. I whipped around and saw him glaring at me. He jerked a thumb at my cell phone, then the glass side door. ‚ÄúTake it outside if it‚Äôs that important.‚Äù His irritated gaze fell on Drew, who happened to be his nephew, but whom he still treated like any other customer. ‚ÄúYou, too.‚Äù  
  
¬† Drew held up a calloused palm, nodding as he slid off his orange vinyl counter stool and headed toward the door, his phone still clutched to his chin. ‚ÄúLook,‚Äù he said to whoever was on the other end of his call. ‚ÄúI get it. But you‚Äôre going to have the window boarded up anyway. So it‚Äôs not going to make any‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† The rest of his conversation was lost as he stepped outside.  
  
¬† Sorry, I mouthed to Ed. Then, to Caleb, I said quickly, ‚ÄúListen, I‚Äôm at work. I never should have picked up in the first place. I only did because . . . because . . .‚Äù  
  
¬† Why had I picked up, especially since Caleb and I hadn‚Äôt spoken in months? Maybe because it was eight o‚Äôclock in the morning, and he never called this early. I‚Äôd assumed it was an emergency, only not an emergency concerning him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLook,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIf that‚Äôs all you wanted, I‚Äôll talk to you later, okay?‚Äù As in, never.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo, Sabrina. I‚Äôve got to talk to you now. The thing is, your mother‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† I knew it. My pulse quickened. ‚ÄúWhat about her? Is there something wrong?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs fine. But she‚Äôs the one who‚Äôs been bugging me to phone, since you won‚Äôt pick up when she calls.‚Äù  
  
¬† My heartbeat slowed. Of course. I should have known. Caleb would never have called, let alone volunteered to fly fifteen hundred miles to get me of his own accord . . . not after the way we‚Äôd ended things. Or not we, exactly, considering the fact that I was the one who‚Äôd packed up my things, handed my keys to his doorman, and left, making me, technically, the one who had ghosted.  
  
¬† But not really. What else could I have done? What kind of relationship had the two of us even had? Not one I‚Äôd wanted anything to do with anymore.  
  
¬† Now I was heading for the door again‚Äîthe Mermaid‚Äôs side door. A rush of humid, saltwater-scented air greeted me as I stepped out onto the sidewalk, ignoring the glare from Ed as well as the curious looks my fellow servers, Angela and Nevaeh, threw me. Neither of them could imagine what was  
so important that I‚Äôd dare take a call during the morning rush. I hardly ever got calls anyway, so this was a first.  
  
¬† A first that was probably going to get me fired.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCaleb, look‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs really worried about you, Sabrina. We all are.‚Äù  
  
¬† It was all I could do to keep from bursting out laughing.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou know your mom pals around with all those meteorologists from the station,‚Äù Caleb went on. ‚ÄúShe says they tell her this one is a real monster. If there were such a thing as a Category Six, this would be it. She says‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTell my mom I‚Äôm fine,‚Äù I interrupted, aware that Drew Hartwell was standing only a few feet away from me, his own cell clutched to his ear, having a not dissimilar conversation. I could hear him telling whoever was on the other end of the phone, ‚ÄúWell, for one thing, because I have other things to do right now than restore a century-old window you waited until the last minute to notice needed repairing. And for another, because I‚Äôm going to have to special-order the replacement glass, and there‚Äôs no way it‚Äôs going to get here before the rain does.‚Äù  
  
¬† Except that Drew Hartwell didn‚Äôt look particularly worried. He never did. Even now his free hand‚Äîthe one not holding his phone‚Äîhad crept beneath his well-worn, sun-faded Little Bridge Island Bocce League T-shirt to scratch lazily at his flat stomach, unconsciously revealing a trail of dark, downy hair that disappeared into the waistband of his cargo shorts . . . the sight of which caused my stomach to give a pleasant lurch, as if I‚Äôd just taken a spin on a Tilt-A-Whirl.  
  
¬† What was wrong with me?  
  
¬† Realizing I was staring, I glanced hastily away, remembering the whispered warning my coworker Angela Fairweather had given me on my first day of work: ‚ÄúStay away from that one. There was a time when that old pickup of his was parked in front of a different house every week. For a while, it was a different house a night.‚Äù  
  
¬† Because apparently Drew Hartwell‚Äîwith his lean six-foot frame, tousled dark hair, permanent deep-sea tan, and summer-sky blue eyes‚Äîwas as much of a player as Caleb and his friends, just of a different variety: Drew was the homegrown style.  
  
¬† Having been born on Little Bridge Island, Drew had never lived anywhere else, with the exception of a few years on the mainland.  
  
¬† Whereas Caleb and his best friend, Kyle‚Äîwho‚Äôd turned my entire life upside down in a single moment‚Äîhad been born in New York City and had traveled all over the world, thanks to their trust funds and wealthy parents.  
  
¬† And yet Caleb still didn‚Äôt know a thing about women. Or at least the one he was currently speaking to.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI can tell your mom that you‚Äôre fine all you want, Sabrina,‚Äù Caleb was saying into my ear. ‚ÄúBut she isn‚Äôt going to stop calling. She said to tell you that she thinks it‚Äôs time you stopped being so stubborn and gave up on this little solo adventure to find yourself, or whatever it is, and come home. And that it shouldn‚Äôt take a Category Five hurricane for you to realize it.‚Äù  
  
¬† I smiled wryly. It sounded exactly like something my mom would say. ‚ÄúWell, do me a favor and let her know that I haven‚Äôt quite finished finding myself, but when I do, she‚Äôll be the first to know. In the meantime, I‚Äôm perfectly capable of taking care of myself. I don‚Äôt need help from her, or anybody else‚Äîespecially you.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs just great, Sabrina.‚Äù Now Caleb sounded offended. ‚ÄúExcuse me for caring. You know, last time I talked to you, you were mad at me for not caring enough‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† I felt a different kind of spurt from my gut, far less pleasant than the one I‚Äôd experienced at the sight of Drew‚Äôs naked stomach. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not what I said, and you know it. There‚Äôs a difference between not caring and calling me a liar.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI never called you a liar, Sabrina. I just said that maybe you were overreacting‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOverreacting? Really, Caleb?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes, overreacting. You know Kyle gets a little frisky when he‚Äôs had too much to drink‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† A little frisky? I was so mad, I had to force myself to gaze past the harbor, out where the turquoise blue sky met the aquamarine sea, in order to steady myself. Something about the sight of that calm, azure water stretching as far as the eye could see always seemed to help me find my equilibrium. I‚Äôd taken to painting it during my time off from work‚Äînot, however, when anyone else was around‚Äîand it always soothed me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to get into it again, Caleb,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI need to go back to my job, or I‚Äôll lose it.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh, wouldn‚Äôt that be a tragedy,‚Äù Caleb sneered. ‚ÄúYour waitressing job at some beach bar in Florida.‚Äù  
  
¬† I glanced hastily in Drew Hartwell‚Äôs direction, fearful that he might have overheard‚ÄîCaleb could be as overbearingly loud on the phone as he was in person.  
  
¬† But fortunately, Drew still seemed preoccupied with his own call.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAt least,‚Äù I hissed at Caleb through gritted teeth, ‚ÄúI have a job.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh, was that supposed to be a blow to my ego, Sabrina?‚Äù Caleb said snarkily. ‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôve never had a job, I‚Äôm somehow inferior to you? Excuse me for not rising to the bait. Look, if you won‚Äôt come with me, at least let me send you a ticket for a commercial flight, since you can‚Äôt seem to be bothered to buy one on your own.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt even try it,‚Äù I snarled into the phone, ‚Äúbecause I‚Äôm not leaving Little Bridge Island. And it‚Äôs Bree now, not Sabrina.‚Äù  
  
¬† Then I hung up on him.  
  
¬† Chapter Two  
  
¬† A hurricane is a rotating storm system that begins over the ocean and can span hundreds of miles across, at the center of which is a region of low pressure called an eye, from which rain bands spiral outward.  
  
¬† It wasn‚Äôt until I was jamming my phone back into the pocket of my jeans that I realized how quiet it had gotten all of a sudden. I couldn‚Äôt hear anything except that Drew Hartwell‚Äôs conversation had ceased . . . and that his gaze was no longer on the harbor in front of us, but on me.  
  
¬† It was difficult to tell given the slant of the sun‚Äîit was shining full on into his face, and I‚Äôd left my sunglasses inside‚Äîbut he appeared to be smiling, that sardonic smile for which Drew Hartwell was well known, and about which Angela had also warned me. I couldn‚Äôt tell how much of my conversation he‚Äôd overheard.  
  
¬† Oh God, I thought, my heart thumping. Don‚Äôt let it have been too much.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFirst hurricane?‚Äù he asked.  
  
¬† I bristled. ‚ÄúWhat? No.‚Äù  
  
¬† The last thing you wanted was for one of these native islanders to accuse you of being ‚ÄúFresh Water‚Äù‚Äînew to the place. They took great joy in informing tourists that ‚Äúconch‚Äù‚Äîa shellfish and local delicacy, served fried at the Mermaid in sandwiches, on salads, and on their own, hush-puppy style‚Äîwas pronounced ‚Äúkonk‚Äù and not ‚Äúkonch,‚Äù and that there were man-eating sharks along the reef, where tourists loved to snorkel (though the truth was that the sharks ate only other fish and were extremely shy, and there‚Äôd been only one reported shark attack in the past fifty years, and that had been when a tourist, showing off, had attacked the shark first).  
  
¬† Getting a sunburn or mosquito bite was a sure sign that you were ‚ÄúFresh Water.‚Äù All native-born Little Bridge Islanders woke up and applied SPF 100 and several layers of mosquito repellant first thing after showering. This was how they managed to avoid both melanoma and the various mosquito-borne illnesses that had been running rampant in South Florida for centuries. Whenever a beet-red, mosquito-stung tourist limped into the caf√©, even my self-absorbed teenage coworker Nevaeh would shake her head and murmur, ‚ÄúOh, poor thing.‚Äù  
  
¬† Which was why I lied to Drew Hartwell.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI went through Wilhelmina when I, uh, first moved here.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh, Wilhelmina,‚Äù he said, and nodded at the memory of the fierce Category 3 storm that a decade earlier had done so much damage.  
  
¬† I didn‚Äôt mention that at the time I‚Äôd been sixteen and living in my parents‚Äô vacation rental, and that at the first hint of wind my mother had insisted on evacuating us to an exclusive resort and spa outside of Miami, where we‚Äôd ridden through the outer rain bands of the sto  
rm in a three-bedroom suite with full power, room service, and our own butler.  
  
¬† Technically, I‚Äôd still gone through Hurricane Wilhelmina . . . just not the way Drew Hartwell thought I had.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo. You going to evacuate?‚Äù he asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt planning on it,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThough people in my family seem to think I should.‚Äù I gestured toward my pocket to indicate my phone.  
  
¬† He nodded again.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFamily,‚Äù he muttered, squinting at the horizon. He said it as if it were a dirty word.  
  
¬† It wasn‚Äôt a total mystery to me why. Angela‚Äôs warning about Drew Hartwell had been echoed by Nevaeh as well, just not for the same reasons. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs crazy,‚Äù Nevaeh had said.  
  
¬† And Nevaeh (Heaven spelled backward) would know, since Drew Hartwell was her uncle. It had been weeks before I‚Äôd learned that the only reason Nevaeh considered her uncle crazy was not because he‚Äôd done anything particularly outlandish, but because he‚Äôd once had a thriving carpentry career up north, which had included a partnership in a fledgling historic restoration company in ‚ÄúNoDo‚Äù (Nevaeh‚Äôs grasp of Manhattan real estate was slim).  
  
¬† And yet he‚Äôd given it all up in order to move back to the island.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWho would do something so nuts?‚Äù Nevaeh had asked me one morning as we were wrapping forks, knives, and spoons into paper napkins. ‚ÄúWho would leave an amazing life in New York City to come back here?‚Äù  
  
¬† I‚Äôd known what she was doing‚Äîfishing around for my reason for having done exactly that‚Äîbut I didn‚Äôt fall for it. Nevaeh was one of the biggest gossips in the caf√©, which was forgivable, since she was fifteen and only working in the diner for the summer because its owners, Lucy and Ed Hartwell, were her great-aunt and uncle. For reasons that had never been fully explained to me, Nevaeh was living with her aunt and uncle instead of her parents, Drew Hartwell‚Äôs sister and a man who was, according to Nevaeh, a famous baseball player who was someday going to come back and take her away from ‚Äúall of this.‚Äù  
  
¬† I‚Äôd said only, ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm sure your uncle Drew had his reasons for leaving the city,‚Äù and left it at that.  
  
¬† But I‚Äôd been unable to keep from wondering myself, especially since the woman with whom Drew had moved back to Little Bridge from New York had apparently had trouble with the adjustment. Nevaeh had kept a sharp eye on her, envying while at the same time scorning her ‚Äúbig city‚Äù ways (‚ÄúI heard she buys this special pink salt that comes all the way from Europe and costs twenty dollars a bottle. Who needs twenty-dollar European pink salt?‚Äù Nevaeh had shaken her head in wonder. ‚ÄúWhat makes it so much better than plain old white American salt?‚Äù).  
Drew was building his own house on beachside property left to him by his parents (who‚Äôd died under circumstances nearly as mysterious as Nevaeh‚Äôs living arrangements . . . or at least, mysterious to me).  
  
¬† It wasn‚Äôt long before rumors began to circulate that all was not well between him and Leighanne (the big-city girlfriend) out there on Sandy Point Beach.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI heard she can‚Äôt take the heat,‚Äù Nevaeh informed me one morning as we were refilling ketchup bottles. ‚ÄúI mean, literally. Uncle Drew hasn‚Äôt got the air-conditioning system installed yet. He says he might not install one at all. He doesn‚Äôt like air-conditioning.‚Äù  
  
¬† I was appalled. ‚ÄúIt was eighty-five degrees last night. I wouldn‚Äôt be able to sleep without AC.‚Äù  
  
¬† Nevaeh nodded. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs more than just that, though. I hear she‚Äôs got island fever.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIsland fever?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like claustrophobia. It happens to people who can‚Äôt stand living so far from the mainland. They have to get out. Just watch. Leighanne‚Äôs gonna dump him and move back to New York. I already warned him, but does he listen to me? Nope.‚Äù  
  
¬† A few weeks later, that‚Äôs exactly what Leighanne did do‚Äîin a dramatic fashion we all got to witness, since she chose to do it at the caf√©, storming in during the height of the breakfast rush and hurling a small object at Drew‚Äôs chest as he sat at his usual place at the counter, sipping his coffee and reading the sports page of the local paper.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHere,‚Äù Leighanne had shouted. ‚ÄúYou can have your damn keys back. I won‚Äôt be needing them anymore.‚Äù  
  
¬† Drew had looked confused . . . even more so when the next thing she‚Äôd hurled at him was, of all things, a saltshaker. I knew this because I‚Äôd been standing beside him holding two orders of huevos rancheros when the object struck him in the chest, then landed at my feet, miraculously unbroken. The shaker was empty, except for a slight tinge of pink at the bottom.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd you can have that back, too,‚Äù Leighanne had shouted. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want anything of yours. And you‚Äôll never have to worry about putting up with anything of mine again.‚Äù  
  
¬† Then she‚Äôd turned and stormed from the restaurant, the glossy brown curls beneath her straw cowboy hat bobbing, while Drew only sat there, looking mildly astonished. At least until Nevaeh, now worried that she was losing her glamorous potential aunt-to-be forever, had cried, ‚ÄúWell, don‚Äôt just sit there, Uncle Drew. Go after her!‚Äù  
  
¬† But Drew had chosen not to‚Äîwhich had probably been for the best, since even if he‚Äôd tried, it would have been too late, given the possible case of island fever. As Leighanne sped off, all of us could see that the back of her Mini Cooper was piled high with her belongings, most likely not only including the infamous salt, but also the heart that she‚Äôd reclaimed from him.  
  
¬† So I could understand why ‚ÄúUncle Drew‚Äù might feel a little down on family at the moment, especially since Nevaeh had spent the better part of the following week bitterly informing anyone who would listen, ‚ÄúI told him she was going to dump him if he wasn‚Äôt more careful. I told him!‚Äù  
  
¬† That didn‚Äôt give Drew the right, however, to swing his unnervingly blue gaze on me and say what he did next, which was, ‚ÄúAlthough in your case, your family is right. You should evacuate, Fresh Water.‚Äù  
  
¬† I was so stunned, I couldn‚Äôt even summon up a suitably stinging retort before he turned and headed coolly back indoors to his breakfast.  
  
¬† Where did he get off, I wondered as I stood there, open-mouthed in the early morning heat, suggesting I couldn‚Äôt handle myself in a hurricane? He barely even knew me. After three months of serving breakfast to him nearly every day‚ÄîSpanish omelet, caf√© con leche, no sugar‚Äîthis was the longest conversation we‚Äôd ever had.  
  
¬† True, he‚Äôd always been a generous tipper‚Äî30 percent, and cash, even when he‚Äôd paid for the meal by credit card.  
  
¬† But still.  
  
¬† Maybe, I told myself as I grasped the handle to the caf√©‚Äôs side door, it wasn‚Äôt that Drew thought I couldn‚Äôt handle a hurricane, but that I‚Äôd been there to witness his humiliating breakup. Some men could be sensitive about things like that.  
  
¬† Although I had to admit, he‚Äôd never seemed too upset about it. I‚Äôd seen at least half a dozen attractive young women walk up to him in the caf√© since and inform him that they had plenty of ‚Äúsalt‚Äù for his ‚Äúshaker‚Äù anytime he needed some . . . not that he appeared to have taken any of them up on it, so far as I could tell.  
  
¬† It was tough to keep a secret in a place as small as Little Bridge. Though I‚Äôd managed to keep mine.  
  
¬† Back inside, the air felt pleasantly cool and scented with the smell of freshly cooked bacon, as it did every morning.  
  
¬† Something was wrong, however. I sensed it as soon as I walked in. The usual early morning sounds to which I‚Äôd grown so accustomed‚Äîthe scrape of forks against plates, and the low murmur of conversation as folks discussed the headlines in the local paper‚Äîwere gone.  
  
¬† For a second, I was worried I really had been fired‚ÄîEd was as well known for his fiery temper as he was for his ability to bake a truly outstanding key lime pie‚Äîbut a glance at Angela‚Äôs and Nevaeh‚Äôs faces showed me this wasn‚Äôt the case. Instead of looking at me, everyone‚Äôs attention was glued to both of the television sets that hung from the ceiling, one at each end of the breakfast counter. Ed kept one tuned to Fox News, and the other to CNN, both with the sound off and closed captioning on. This seemed to keep all customers happy.  
  
¬† But today, out of deference to the storm, both televisions were tuned to the Weather Channel, with the sound up.  
  
¬† That‚Äôs how I was able to hear the meteorologists announce that Hurricane Marilyn was making a turn, and now appeared to be heading straight for Little Bridge Island.  
  
¬† Chapter Three  
  
¬† The high winds of a hurricane sweeping across the ocean can produce a dangerous storm surge, a wall of water that can cause massive flooding even hundreds of miles inland.  
  
¬† Some people like to say that Little Bridge Island was discovered by the Spanish in 1513, but of course that isn‚Äôt true. You can‚Äôt ‚Äúdiscover‚Äù something that‚Äôs already been occupied for thousands of years before you ever even got there. Little Bridge, a small island in a chain of similar islands off the coast of the tip of Florida known as the Florida Keys, was home to the Tequesta Indians for many centuries before the Spanish invaded it. The Indians were enslaved, and eventually the Keys were turned into U.S. territory.  
  
¬† Little Bridge got its name due to the fact that it‚Äôs connected to the rest of the Keys by a bridge.  
  
¬† But since most of the Keys are connected to one another by bridges, it makes no sense that Little Bridge is named after the fact that it has a bridge.  
  
¬† But that‚Äôs part of its quirky appeal, and probably what drew my father to it when he was a young man and began planning our family vacations. He liked quirky places, and Little Bridge, with its odd name and even odder residents, is one of the quirkiest.  
  
¬† So Little Bridge was where we vacationed every year, even though my mother was pretty vocal about the fact that she‚Äôd have preferred to go somewhere more cosmopolitan, such as the Hamptons, Paris, or Ibiza.  
  
¬† But like my father, I grew to love our vacation house on the canal, waking to the smell of the salt water, finding manatees drinking from the hose of our dock, watching egrets pluck their delicate way through the sand. I loved boating, the rush of wind through my hair, the glassy stillness of the water near the sandbars, the challenge of painting that water, making it look as mirrorlike and gleaming on my canvas as it did in real life.  
  
¬† And of course walking through the quaint, sun-drenched town, the historic buildings‚Äîby law none were allowed to be more than two stories tall, because anything higher might impede a neighbor‚Äôs view of the sunset‚Äîeach painted a different shade of pink or blue or yellow, stopping for ice cream or groceries at the locally owned shops. I could see why my father loved Little Bridge, why he would have moved there if his job as a successful defense attorney in Manhattan‚Äîand my mother‚Äôs dislike of the town‚Äîhadn‚Äôt made such a dream impossible.  
  
¬† I loved it, too.  
I felt safe in Little Bridge‚Äînot that, back then, I had any reason to feel unsafe anywhere.  
  
¬† It made perfect sense to me that it was to Little Bridge that I fled when my safety felt threatened. My father‚Äîif he hadn‚Äôt passed away last year‚Äîwould have understood.  
  
¬† But now the new comfortable, safe life I‚Äôd put so carefully together seemed to be crumbling. I knew it the minute I walked into my apartment after I got off work and found my roommate, Daniella, throwing clothes into a suitcase.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhere are you going?‚Äù I asked, though I had a sinking feeling I already knew. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not evacuating, are you?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSure am.‚Äù She took a slurp from the frozen margarita she‚Äôd poured herself. I‚Äôd seen the pitcher from the blender sitting on the kitchen counter as I‚Äôd walked into the two-bedroom apartment we shared.  
  
¬† The place was tiny‚Äîeach of the bedrooms hardly large enough to fit a queen-size bed‚Äîbut I considered myself lucky to have found it . . . not the place so much as the person who‚Äôd come with it.  
  
¬† A curvaceous, good-humored ER nurse, Daniella was outgoing and bubbly‚Äîexactly the kind of person I needed to be around after what I‚Äôd gone through this past year back in New York, just like the job at the Mermaid was exactly the kind of job I needed now. I was up and out the door by five thirty every morning, even on my days off, since Gary was used to being fed that early and woke me like clockwork daily at dawn.  
  
¬† This worked out well since Daniella was a morning person, too‚Äînot to mention extremely social. She seemed to be friends with nearly everyone on the island, which wasn‚Äôt surprising: at some point, she‚Äôd either given a stitch, shot, X-ray, or bandage to nearly all of them.  
  
¬† That‚Äôs how she‚Äôd snagged her two-bedroom rental for such a (comparatively) low rate: because she‚Äôd treated the landlady‚Äôs son for chronic asthma. Two-bedroom apartments were rare on Little Bridge‚Äîat least ones that were affordable to locals, since most living spaces on the island proper had been snatched up by vacation rental companies and were hawked at astronomical prices online to tourists.  
  
¬† But since our landlady, Lydia, like most people, adored Daniella, she rented to her at a discount.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMandatory evac for all city employees,‚Äù Dani was explaining to me, with her usual infallible cheer. ‚ÄúThat includes the hospital. I‚Äôve been reassigned to beautiful, sunny, downtown Coral Gables.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCoral Gables?‚Äù I lifted Gary, who‚Äôd rushed over to give me his customary greeting (sprawling supine at my feet, then rubbing his face all over my shoes), and took a seat. ‚ÄúThat makes no sense. Why would they send you to Coral Gables when the hurricane is supposed to be headed here?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre asking for local bureaucracy to make sense?‚Äù Daniella let out a delighted laugh. Dani found everything delightful, even medical emergencies. She loved making sick people feel better. ‚ÄúYou should know better than that by now, Bree!‚Äù Then she sobered and said, ‚ÄúNo, but really, it‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt want people thinking it‚Äôs safe to stay here. If they know hospital and emergency services will still be staffed and up and running, no one will leave, because they‚Äôll be lulled into a false sense of security. So all of us‚ÄîER staff, police, the firehouse‚Äîhave been assigned to work at hurricane shelters out of the direct path of the eye. They hope that by doing this, the good citizens of this fine isle will follow. They‚Äôre sending us all out on buses later this afternoon. Which is why I‚Äôm drinking this.‚Äù She wagged her margarita at me. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have to drive.‚Äù  
  
¬† I stared glumly at the sunlight streaming in through her bedroom window. Given the blue sky and steamy temperature outside, it was hard to believe any sort of storm was on its way.  
  
¬† But the Weather Channel, blaring in the other room, was telling a different story, as were the dozens of text messages piling up on my phone, many from Caleb. And my mother.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs bugging you?‚Äù Dani asked. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not upset about this hurricane, are you? Chances are it will lose a ton of steam over Cuba, you know. It‚Äôs a terrible thing to say, and poor Cuba, but that‚Äôs usually what happens. We‚Äôll just get a lot of wind and rain. But they have to evacuate us anyway, you know, just in case.‚Äù  
  
¬† I smiled wanly at her.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNot the storm,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúJust . . . whatever. My ex called earlier and offered to come pick me up in his private plane.‚Äù  
  
¬† Dani, who knew most of what had happened between me and Cal‚Äîthough not the most sordid details, which were hard for me to discuss‚Äîalmost spat out the sip of margarita she‚Äôd taken. ‚ÄúI hope you told him to stick his plane where the sun don‚Äôt shine!‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOf course I did. Well, not in so many words. But I kind of regret it now that everybody‚Äôs evacuating. Drew Hartwell even told me I should go. He called me Fresh Water.‚Äù  
  
¬† Now Dani did spit, or looked as if she wanted to, at least. ‚ÄúDrew Hartwell can kiss my butt. He thinks he‚Äôs God‚Äôs gift to the ladies. Hey, look, I‚Äôve got an idea. Why don‚Äôt you come with me? They‚Äôre getting us all hotel rooms. I‚Äôm sure it will be super nice. Last time they put us up at the Westin. It had a pool and a generator and everything. And, oh my God, there were these firemen from Key West‚Äîyou won‚Äôt believe how we partied. It was like The Bachelorette, but on steroids.‚Äù  
  
¬† I smiled again, but less wanly. ‚ÄúThanks, but I can‚Äôt. I‚Äôve got this guy to worry about.‚Äù  
  
¬† We both eyed Gary, who‚Äôd crawled off my lap and was now sniffing the side of Daniella‚Äôs suitcase suspiciously. He either knew something was going on or was looking for a new place to curl up and sleep. Knowing Gary, it was the latter. His survival instincts weren‚Äôt exactly stellar. A middle-aged gray tabby cat who had spent years living in an animal shelter farther up the Keys before I‚Äôd come along and adopted him, he wanted only to be in the presence of human beings at all times, no matter what they were doing . . . even something as mundane as packing.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBring him along,‚Äù Daniella suggested. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure the hotel‚Äôs pet friendly. Or, if not, we can smuggle him in.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBut you know Gary doesn‚Äôt exactly travel well.‚Äù  
  
¬† It was true. Gary howled up a storm when in moving vehicles, even when medicated, and a four-hour bus ride to the mainland with him sounded like one of the circles of hell.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd besides, I don‚Äôt want to sponge off the city‚Äôs dime. I‚Äôd feel guilty.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh for God‚Äôs sake.‚Äù Daniella leaned over to sweep some jewelry off her dressing table and into a pouch. The minute her back was turned, Gary leaped into her suitcase and began sniffing the inside. ‚ÄúThe administration said it was okay for first responders to bring their families on the bus, and into their hotel rooms. You‚Äôre the closest thing I‚Äôve got to family around here.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAw.‚Äù I was genuinely touched . . . though relieved that she hadn‚Äôt noticed what Gary was doing now, which was pawing through the clothes she‚Äôd neatly folded into the suitcase, in order to make himself a comfortable place to sleep. I stepped toward the bed and swiftly lifted his nearly twenty-pound girth from the suitcase, as he let out a tiny squeak of protest, then plopped him on the floor. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs sweet. But I think Gary and I would be better off here, especially given his recent medical issues.‚Äù  
  
¬† Daniella frowned, but I could tell she agreed with me. I hadn‚Äôt meant to adopt a cat as needy as Gary, whose personality was a joy but whose health, from having spent so many years on the streets and then in the shelter, was a wreck. Just a week earlier I‚Äôd ended up shelling out twelve hundred dollars for the removal of every last one of his teeth due to his having something called feline stomatitis, a painful inflammation of the mouth.  
  
¬† And while he already seemed to be on the mend, in a lot less pain (and a lot less smelly), I was in no hurry to take him on a weekend jaunt out of town, hurricane or no hurricane. He was still on antibiotics and several other medications and could eat only soft canned foods that I carefully mashed for him.  
  
¬† But it was all worth it. At night, after thoroughly grooming himself and making a careful inspection of the entire apartment, he climbed onto my bed, curled up close to me, and dozed of  
f.  
  
¬† And for the first time since that last morning with Caleb, I was finally able to get a good night‚Äôs sleep. It seemed to me that this was only because of the sweet, heavy, purring warmth beside me.  
  
¬† I hadn‚Äôt wanted to mention any of this to Caleb, let alone my mother or any of my other friends back home. Only my dad, a fellow animal lover, would have understood.  
  
¬† But Dad was gone now.  
  
¬† Daniella looked down at Gary as he wandered over toward her laundry basket full of dirty clothes, sniffed it, then leaped inside, molding a soft nest out of her scrubs, pajamas, and underwear from the day before while purring so loudly we could both hear him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI get it,‚Äù Dani said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs your boy, and he‚Äôs not really travel ready at the moment, storm or no storm.‚Äù  
  
¬† I smiled at her gratefully. She really was the perfect roommate. She‚Äôd been fine with my asking if it would be all right if I got a cat (my first, since my mom had never wanted animals in the house. ‚ÄúSo dirty!‚Äù she always said. ‚ÄúAnd they scratch up the furniture‚Äù). Gary had instantly won Daniella over with his big green eyes, foot-to-face-rub greetings, and constant purring.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBut,‚Äù she said, returning to her packing, ‚Äúif you change your mind, you can always take my car and come up. It doesn‚Äôt have much gas in it, but I‚Äôll leave it parked over at the hospital with the keys under the visor anyway. Otherwise I‚Äôd say grab a rental car, but I heard the tourists snaked all of those in a panic to get out of here early this morning.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh. Well, thanks, Dani. I might take you up on that.‚Äù I doubted I would, actually, but a car low on gas was better than no car at all.

1mqcs7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoweredByExperience/comments/1mqcs7k/explore_the_best_electric_kettle_by_chantal_mia/,Explore the Best Electric Kettle by Chantal Mia Worth It or Not,"The Chantal Mia Electric Kettle ELSL37-03M-XX in marigold has had a cozy corner in my kitchen for a few weeks now, and I‚Äôve been putting it through its paces every single day. From brewing herbal teas on a chilly morning to preparing a quick cup of pour-over coffee during busy afternoons, this kettle has been nothing short of a reliable companion. At first glance, its compact size and the bright marigold color caught my eye, but it was the promise of added functionality that sealed the deal. Yet, as with most things, there are strengths and weaknesses to consider.

**Standout Design and Build Quality**  
One of the first things I noticed about this electric kettle was its solid stainless steel construction. It feels robust without being heavy, weighing in at just 2.3 pounds. The all-steel interior is a big deal for the health-conscious, as it eliminates exposure to plastic. Add to that its small footprint‚Äîperfectly sized for tight kitchen spaces‚Äîand it‚Äôs clear the design is both functional and stylish. The ergonomic handle is perfectly positioned for easy pouring, which is surprisingly comfortable, even when filled to its 32-ounce max capacity. However, marigold may not fit everyone‚Äôs kitchen aesthetic, so take the color into account if you prefer a more neutral palette.  

**Positives**  
- Robust stainless steel interior ensures durability and safety.  
- Compact dimensions fit snugly in small spaces without crowding counters.  
- The ergonomic handle is thoughtfully designed and easy to use.

[Check Chantal Mia Electric Kettle ELSL37-03M-XX price on Amazon.](https://techieupdate.com/p/b0944bql4c/)

**Performance and Heating Time**  
This kettle has a 1000W base, so I wasn‚Äôt surprised by its quick boiling time‚Äîroughly three minutes for a full capacity. The patented dual-function spout proved impressive, especially for my pour-over coffee ritual. It allows a precise, slow flow that mimics high-end gooseneck kettles, but also switches seamlessly to a faster pour for general kitchen needs like soups or tea. The spout does an excellent job cooling boiling water to a coffee-friendly temperature of 205¬∞F as it pours, which I found particularly helpful for perfect brews. That said, while it‚Äôs fast and efficient for a single person or couple, its smaller size may leave larger households wanting a bigger capacity option.  

**Safety Features that Reassure**  
Using the Mia kettle has been worry-free, thanks to features like auto shut-off and boil-dry protection. I tested the boil-dry scenario intentionally (with supervision), and the kettle stopped as advertised‚Äîensuring no accidental damages or hazards occur. Plus, indicator lights provide a quick confirmation that it‚Äôs working at a glance. The 360-degree swivel base added a cherry on top, making it effortlessly simple to place it back from any angle after use.  

**Negatives**  
- Limited 32-ounce capacity may not be sufficient for larger families or heavy tea drinkers.  
- Marigold, while charming, might not blend with all kitchen styles.  

**Cleaning and Maintenance Made Easy**  
If you‚Äôre like me and loathe complicated cleaning routines, the Mia kettle is a blessing. It features a wide opening lid, which made cleaning the interior a breeze. No awkward maneuvering needed to get my hand inside‚Äîthe ergonomic design is simple yet efficient. The only downside here is that it is listed as hand-wash only, which adds a bit of an inconvenience for the dishwasher crowd. Quick note regarding limescale buildup: since it‚Äôs stainless steel, regular descaling will keep it looking pristine and functioning well.   

**Everyday Versatility**  
This isn‚Äôt just a kettle; it‚Äôs more of a jack-of-all-trades kitchen companion. Whether heating water for oatmeal, sterilizing glass bottles, or pouring hot water for instant soups, this appliance handles everything like a champ. I even used it a few times to heat water for my DIY face steam ritual. Its multi-purpose functionality has made it indispensable in my day-to-day life.  

**Drawbacks**  
- Hand-washing is a must; no dishwasher option is available.  
- Capacity isn‚Äôt ideal for batch use or large servings.  

**Competing Products**  
When put side by side with similar models, the Mia Electric Kettle holds its own on several fronts. For instance, competitors like the COSORI Gooseneck Kettle might offer a larger capacity or additional spout precision, but they often come with a steeper price tag and lack the same friendly design for multiple uses. On the other hand, budget stainless steel kettles tend to compromise on features like boil-dry protection or ergonomic forms. The Mia strikes a well-balanced middle ground, prioritizing quality while staying approachable on budget. It may not be the absolute best for hardcore coffee purists or larger households, but it works brilliantly for single-person use or small families.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
In terms of value, I‚Äôd say this kettle performs exceptionally well for the price range it‚Äôs targeting. It‚Äôs not packed with gimmicks or high-end embellishments, but what it does, it does without complaints. The safety features and the patented spout design alone justify its price point‚Äîadd the stainless steel build, and it feels like money well spent. Whether you‚Äôre replacing an old kettle or buying your first one, it fits smart spending standards.

1mqcrza,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mqcrza/how_should_i_24fm_deal_with_my_controlling_sister/,how should I (24fm) deal with my controlling sister (30fm)?,"Hey guys,

I am new to this subreddit, read the rules I hope its okay to post this.

My sister wanted me to move in with her after she broke up with her abusive boyfriend 2.5 years ago and I split up with my long term bf as well.

We agreed to move in together, but the flat would still be manageable money wise if one moves out as its very cheap.

It didnt have a kitchen or furniture and she (as she is an architect) told me her vision of out new home together. I totally agreed to make everything her way as she knows best. and so we did. it took a lot of effort to carry the kitchen and all the furniture, we also built highbeds ourselves as this would spare space. So far so good.

We lived together for a year and made a lot of compromises together to make living together suitable for the both of us. She is very perfectionistic, struggles a lot with depression and BPD which often shows in procrastination and social isolation. I am well sort of all over the place with my ADHD, more of a hobby and job hopper. She thinks organisation is everything I think cleanliness is.

Issues came up during that time where she would for instance be mad at me for a week straight without telling me to then say ""you went to the gym on monday but you should have done the laundry"". I understand criticism and always try to find systems to make things easier.

Theeen 1.5 years ago I moved to the countryside because of a job opportunity (managing a gym) to which she replied ""I wish I was happy for you but I am just jealous"". That hurt a lot.

Fast forward I moved back into the city as I was finishing evening classes to get my high shool diploma (yeey) and now we moved back together. 

The first two months were hard because I took on two jobs (one to help a friend out) and was rearly home. I still did housework but realised she was doing more and brought up making a set system for everything to be fair. she agreed. in the time I was studying for my last assignment she took over everything. cooked, cleaned, laundry, everything. I proposed to help but she insisted to do this for me. She told me I shouldn't worry about anything else and she loves to do this for me as I was working 60h plus going to shool and she was doing 15h of work plus a course which takes about 10 each week.

Now we are back in the groove of things...pretty much.
Okay so all of this will be important with today's situation.

I stood up early to do my chores. I cleaned the bathroom, sweeped the floors, washed and hung up laundry and took out the trash. 

After that I practiced guitar and sung a little before going to the gym and work.

I called her during my break about a random topic and she said ""you were really in a hurry today weren't you?"" and I replied saying well I kinda made myself be in a hurry because I wanted to do everything (inc hobbies) before leaving for work.

My sister was very distressed because I didnt hang up wet floor wipers the right way, there was a cleaning soap still out and the basket in the living room as well as my guitar.

She then said ""next time just clean the bathroom"" and I told her I also wanted clean floors as thats very important to me.

Then later that day we talked in person and I tried to explain to her that I cant always do things the way she expects me to but I am really trying. She said I should just do less in general (hobby wise etc) and just do one chore at a time. I told her thats not how my brain works and I need to do a lot of things. I will do more in the household if she wants me to but I can't guarantee to not make mistakes in the future.

She then said it was so hard for her to take over all the housework earlier this year. (I did not ask for that!) She said I could do better if I spend less free time on hobbirs and dont go on dates anymore ( I am single and she has always been jealous of the time I spend with my guys saying she feels neglected).
Worth mentioning: even with 60 at work when I was living in another city and having a relationship I made a point to meet her for lunch or coffee every week!

I tried to tell her I am already meeting her half way (doing my work, using only eco cleaners, being more frugal with water, furniture is the way she wants it, I try very hard to follow her organisation systems, windows, curtains only open when shes okay with that etc.)
Also I made the comparison saying I don't blame her for the way her brain works (when she is depressed she sleeps a lot and she never goes out, when I was visiting her place sometimes it was organized but super filthy [did not mention this point, just wanted to add it!])

I think that's controlling of her and I told her. She got extremely agry and started crying.

Do you have advice on how to handle this? And do you agree it's controlling behaviour?

But lately, I‚Äôve been realizing that real love goes way beyond that first rush.

Real love, the kind that lasts, is more of a choice than a feeling. It‚Äôs choosing to be patient when you're tired. Choosing to listen instead of just waiting to speak. Choosing to support your partner even when your own day didn‚Äôt go well.

And it‚Äôs not always romantic. It shows up in the smallest ways ‚Äî making coffee for someone without being asked. Remembering the thing they said they needed from the store. Sending a ‚Äúmade me think of you‚Äù meme just to brighten their day.

We often chase the high of ‚Äúfalling in love,‚Äù but we don‚Äôt talk enough about the effort that *staying in love* takes ‚Äî especially once the honeymoon phase fades.

I‚Äôm learning that love is not always loud or dramatic. Sometimes it‚Äôs quiet, steady, and ordinary. But it‚Äôs in those ordinary moments that something extraordinary is built.

If you're in a relationship ‚Äî or hoping to be in one ‚Äî it might be helpful to ask:

I will lock the door to our apartment when I‚Äôm home at night and especially if I‚Äôm in another room. We live in a building so there are other people who have access to our door and it‚Äôs a pretty new situation so we don‚Äôt know everybody. I don‚Äôt know - it seems pretty reasonable to keep the door locked at times.  The door has a deadbolt and a knob lock and I‚Äôll just lock the knob.  And I always try to run over and open the door for her when she gets home so she doesn‚Äôt have to deal with unlocking it.  

She‚Äôll get angry about this every single time and it‚Äôll set off about 4 consecutive days of me being locked out every single time I leave the apartment.  I can step out to take the dogs outside for 1 minute and both the deadbolt and knob will be locked. If I ever forget to grab my keys before leaving she will not allow me in and say that I‚Äôm being irresponsible and expect her to be the only adult in the relationship. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why you think it‚Äôs fair that I have to be the only responsible one. If you were an adult you would not anyways forget things.‚Äù Putting the blame on me for her not letting me in.  One time she actually pushed a couch in front of the door.  In these situations I‚Äôve driven over two hours to get to my family‚Äôs house and left without any clothes or access to my work computer, etc.  She maintains that she did nothing wrong.  Never an apology. 

Previously we lived in a house in a different state with no family nearby and she locked me out for the same reason in the middle of the night in the winter with the dogs. Sat outside for an hour and eventually she let the dogs in but not me. Another hour later she let me in. I guess times have changed. 

Other than that she‚Äôs now started to prevent me from using things that she has bought from the grocery store like eggs and coffee. Mind you I buy plenty of groceries, just not ones we already have in the house. The other day she took eggs I was cooking off the stove and dumped them in the garbage, hid toothpaste on me so I could not brush my teeth, and took my coffee away while I was actively pouring it causing it to spill. And I actually had bought that coffee so we don‚Äôt even have logical consistency. 

And this is really just the tip of the iceberg - the amount of verbal abuse directed at both myself and my family is intolerable.  Haven‚Äôt had a word of affection or general kindness in months, just blame and anger. My possessions have been destroyed and thrown outside.

The insane part is this person was my best friend for ten years before we got married (married 3 years now). I‚Äôm extremely close to divorce but still can‚Äôt get myself to go through with it because of all the memories and hope for the future.

First I washed the seeds, dried them and roasted them as you lite roast coffee beans (mistake) in my air fryer (Philips HD9200) very good for roasting coffee beans as far as an air fryer can go.

The next say I proseed to grind them first by smashing them a little bit with a vessel and mortar since they are a little bit big for a regular coffee grinder.

Then I grindee the first shot 24g (first picture, not yet tamped) with a cheap flat burr grinder on the coarsest setting then on my hand grinder on 20 clicks (I usually do 22 clicks for 16-17g) the puck was so shallow as if I made 16g shot, the shot came in 10 seconds and was so watery as if there wasn't anything in the basket!

There is no bounds that this ache won‚Äôt go to destroy any resilience you or I may still possess. The sheer quantity of outs I was handed are beyond humorous in hindsight. As I still have the strength to tell you, please for the love of what‚Äôs holy don‚Äôt inhale those spores. If you are where I left this writing, promptly burn yourself and the sanctum to ashes. If you refuse, you‚Äôll suffer a fate worse than death.

I suppose some explanation is in order before such an ask. As an adolescent, I had lost my father to his own means. It was beyond challenging for my mother to console my prepubescent self whilst she was still grieving. I simply don‚Äôt think she grasped the emotions we both felt or my father‚Äôs reasons.¬†

Little me hadn‚Äôt either, don‚Äôt get me wrong. The place we resided was most certainly‚Ä¶ shameful, but we lived well so that wasn‚Äôt the culprit. Isolated buildings that would befall the sorest eyes with a hint of doubt‚Äì far into the American South‚Äôs forests were never supposed to nest the well off. The only ‚Äúsuitable‚Äù appearing houses were winding and nonsensical architecture that required barbed wire and fences to ward off untoward neighbors.¬†

Those were the exceptions.Very few lived within those barbed forts and those who did were seldom middle-class and up. Most people lived in trailer homes that were tossed in handfuls beside roadways or sometimes bedded deeply into the woods. Both cases, there were always trailers that had so much trash in their yard you couldn‚Äôt see the door. Anonymously, the lack of people didn‚Äôt mean the ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù didn‚Äôt have obscene quantities of churches and graveyards littered throughout‚Äì some of which barely counted as usable anymore. All to say that we were far from a nuclear family. We weren‚Äôt in some white-picket and cookie cutter abode.¬†

In my life, however, I did have a blessing: my father. He was a flare in my world that guided my hand until his abrupt end. He and my mother had me quite young, but they made due and loved me dearly. His mind was ailed tremendously and beckoned him to recall memories from his distant past, but he did his damndest to not let it get the better of him.¬†

Fighting against the grain of his condition, he served as my light and made our residence feel luxurious. Almost as if every morning we got to rise to a wondrous dawn with speckles of dew coating your face after stepping out onto a spacious patio.¬†

My parents struggled in scrounging together enough for both necessities and my academics. The hardship was worth it, because thankfully I had flourished in school. I remember my father always telling me I was ‚Äúthe smartest dumb person he knew‚Äù or I ‚Äúgot no grit‚Äù and went along with my peers far too easily despite what my grades would suggest. I made it through most of my school years with few hiccups and little surprises. There was one extraordinary one though.¬†

Miraculously, in Podunk nowhere, the school had enough money to fully fund a collegiate experience for me and surely enough my scores made me a good candidate. If you‚Äôd asked me at that moment, I would‚Äôve told you I had the world around my finger. The life I could live! I was already planning how I‚Äôd get my mother that wondrous lake front property we observed in awe during our intermittent swims down a river float.¬†

I imagined her drinking a delightful coffee that permeated the house with its profound yet welcomed smells‚Äì that she would sit in front of the obscenely large window that faced the wondrously clear waters of the river and flick through the daily newspaper. She worked so hard with my father to give me a life their parents failed to give them. She deserved a better existence‚Äì one where something as simple as daily chores wouldn‚Äôt remind her of that wretched night that rendered her a widow.

Those dreams lasted 3 years. For 3 years I felt like I was going somewhere. Public college was not beyond my comprehension and I worked hard to make my parents proud. The tower of glass I stood upon shattered when the county police had contacted my flip phone. Bluntly and with staggering lack of emotion, an officer explained that my mother had been rotting away in her own house for multiple months. I never thought such brief synopsis would ever break me so deeply. The cop had hardly finished his sentence when I had begun crying silent wails between gasps for air‚Äì unable to process the anguish and screaming in just how overwhelmed my mind was with those few words the officer decided to spare me. He spoke as though he just barely got to swallow his food before he told me the news. Time frame and all, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the man with the groggy and¬† some bass voice was sitting on his office chair grotesquely inhaling a gas station sandwich while breaking the news to me. I‚Äôd reckon he lost a bet and pulled the shortest straw and had to be the bearer.

Given finals, and exorbitant phone bills, I had not contacted her in quite some time. That only added unnecessary salt to the gaping wound that was losing her. This ache garnered an exponential factor to it; each scrap of information and every event kindling the fire. Gathering myself, I of course inquired the same anyone else would, ‚ÄúHow?‚Äù Muttering out a ‚Äúsorry ma‚Äôam‚Äù or two and an audible bite later, he explains that the coroner reported that from mandibles to frontal lobe, her face had been completely *flattened*. Her nails and fingers were worn down to stubs, only her post-metacarpals remained where once fleshy fingertips used to be.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of the worst I‚Äôve heard. Some of ‚Äòem rookies quit the force ‚Äòn leapt off planet Earth after,‚Äù he said as he shifted uncomfortably at the recollection. I hung up on him and spent the rest of the night consoling myself over a bottle of wine.

The cause of death, in some twisted comedy, was the least concerning factor. Why was her body spotless other than decay and her wounds? Why was there no sign of struggle? Simple. She had conducted this act of masochism upon *herself*, bashing her *own* skull against the wall until she had collapsed in a bloody heap on the ground.¬†

When I learned these details, I was shocked to my core. I froze as though every moment I allowed my mind to nauseously cling and swirl on the words was a second in arctic waters. I thought that somehow, I must have been asleep and this was some wretched nightmare‚Äì any moment I would awake in my dorm and this was the end product of an energy drink fueled study session.

I‚Äôm not sure how anyone would continue their college work after. It was a miracle I found the drive within myself to even *function*, in all honesty. I do believe half of that vigor was from an idea: the police must have ruled incorrectly. Someone did this to my kind, innocent mother, surely!¬†

I should‚Äôve never ventured from that tight-knit university town back into those horrendous forests. I wish I had my hindsight before that 6 hour drive back to my home-sweet-middle-of-nowhere-home.

My mind was soothed by the expedition. Seldom listening to the radio, I had almost completely missed the drive. I was always taught to take in every moment and never take a second for granted. Yet those hours on the highway that night were just‚Ä¶ otherworldly. I was still mentally grounded, but sorrow had made me drive down the interstate, highways, down those winding county roads‚Äì all with white knuckles and gritted teeth. I couldn‚Äôt count the tears because they had flowed for at least the last hour. After a lot of reflection on those roads and a slow anticipation, I finally made it to my home county.

I had arrived back to that house for the first time since winter break. I couldn‚Äôt bear to gaze upon the place after knowing what acts were conducted within its walls. We weren‚Äôt the worst of the bunch. The trailer was impeccably clean as well as the yard. Well, except for the absurdly tall flora outside due to my mother‚Äôs procrastination to mow and also her suicide. I slowly drank it all in‚Äì my childhood home still the way it always was. But now, one of the most important elements will never come back.

I eventually brought myself to the door, almost breaking down into tears once again. I had driven myself into an anxious state with thoughts of what may lay behind it. Even still, I make a step into the trailer. The stench that arose from that doorway was so offensive it made me vomit the instant it came into contact with my olfactory; as if my body was so disgusted by its presence that it believed death awaited those who inhaled its repulsiveness.¬†

I can‚Äôt begin to describe it. Some mixture of advanced detritus and the aroma of death had landed a blow to my senses so swiftly I was half certain I were to keel over and perish‚Äì like the birds used by miners¬† to detect poisonous air. This, is how the spores claimed me as their next victim. One of the hundreds of species that had decided to call that trailer a host was the prior mentioned fungal spores.

You see, infections can sometimes take days, weeks, or years to show symptoms. This took mere hours. Its side-effects are adjacent to nothing cataloged in human findings. It tears and rips at your ability to fight it, but it causes no disturbance to your immune system. Then what does it do? It eats away and burrows within your synapses. Feasting upon the lobes of your brain and draining your control of your cerebellum. This is the nail that will shut my coffin as well as yours. You shall see.

I didn‚Äôt know what had driven me yet, but something deep within was gnawing at my neurons. It was a fight or flight strength response that was ‚Äúfighting‚Äù me into that damned house. I gave into the begging and sealed my fate by continuing past the entryway. Each and every room was just as clean as the outside. Even in the very small abode, she had every corner decorated to her liking. A meal was completely composted on the kitchen table but the rooms were otherwise spotless.

Finally, I stumbled upon the living room. Beyond the lacking light from the early day, I unthinkingly followed the stench that coated the house. Yes, this was where the aroma had permeated and assaulted my being. On the wall was a large splatter of cracked blood and flesh. I held back what little bile was left within and my need to cry out, still managing a whimper. There was something odd about the whole macabre scene. A good half foot of the wall was missing. My mother‚Äôs scratch marks were very blatant along with chalk-adjacent bone residue drawn onto the walls. A thought had intruded my shocked self. This was the first major insight that I shouldn‚Äôt have stumbled across in aeons of attempts over at this day. Yet the mycelium bedding into my nerves spoke a thought into my subconscious. I attempted to ignore my mother‚Äôs decaying matter that was left over after the removal of her cadaver and fish around in the hole in the wall. I felt something.¬†

I knew it would be there, but that seemingly intrusive thought coming to fruition was jarring to say the least. I struggled to reposition my arm to pull it out, but eventually could see the loosely bonded paper. A realization hit me like a Semi who clothes-lined a car. Why would this paper, that my mother had run home and brutalized herself attempting to obtain, seemingly, be labeled with the name of one of the many nearby churches? Why was the repulsive cologne of the house coming from the paper‚Äì not the decomposition or mildew, but from a pristine, coverless notebook? I had little time to wrap my head around these inquisitions as I felt a scratching behind my eyes which led me to follow its trail of torment.

The sun hadn‚Äôt shined over the trees as I left my mother‚Äôs trailer. I waded through the damp grass that had overtaken the yard‚Äì the sky was that beautiful light blueish green hue. I had seen the church on my drive here. I embarrassingly started breathing heavily as I had to climb a hill or two during the walk. It was serenely tranquil. Scanning the nearby trailers, I realized how fresh it all still was in my memory. The neighbors that always complained over the smallest of things, the children that I went to school with and made acquaintances with, those trailers you never go to near, all so clear and nostalgic.¬†

By the time my mind returned to the present, the early autumn air was chilling the exposed skin that my clothes didn‚Äôt cover. By the time the church was within my vision, my nose was already running and I was partially shivering.¬†

This little break in the emotion allowed my new tenant to nest into its home with little turmoil; rooting itself deeply. As I walked it grew, as I reminisced it latched on, and as I saw the church it salivated at what was to come.

I knew the church, and this walk, very well. My father had queerly stumbled home from his ‚Äúsermons‚Äù at that hellish sanctuary at the strangest hours of the night. Calling it a church is sacrilegious, honestly. But, it brought food to the table so we did not question him intrinsically about it. Stepping onto its grass driveway, I realized the horrid thing looked as if it were barely standing. The exterior was fairly weathered, but the *interior* was almost hazardous to anything mortal. A similar fog doused the interior of the premises that was inside of my mother‚Äôs trailer. It had softly fallen out of the windows and vents; deceivingly appearing as a simple dusty side-effect to the building‚Äôs age‚Äì that is almost impossibly old.¬†

I‚Äôm surprised the foundation hadn't given way. Out of all of the churches and graveyards, this one was 6-fold the most ancient looking with the freshest appearing graves. The trees and forestry at these facilities are usually snuggled comfortably around the perimeter. Here, however, they were extremely eroded back and dead‚Äì the flora adorned the most peculiar color and no matter how dead it looked, it stood defiantly. I almost walked into the church door because of how lost in thought I had become.¬†

As I turned the knob of the obscenely thick door with a ch-CHUNK of the rusted metal moving, It began to hurt to breathe, blink, pretty much anything needed for human function. My vision had blurred from the ‚Äúmist‚Äù so heavily my sight was as useful as a child attempting to see under the water at a pool. Trudging onto the ashen-textured carpet, each step sent a plume of dust up into my nostrils. Within were pews, stained glass windows, and a stage without a single sign of a cross, the star of David, or any religious symbology. If I didn‚Äôt know any better, I‚Äôd say it was a sad mockery of what a church should be. The detritus was clear as day and I was worried about the sheer multitude of it. Before I could get lost in thought once more, my newly found foresight ‚Äúforesaw‚Äù another source of the wretched perfume‚Äì this time a staircase which I trudged up without using the rail in fear of splinters.

After what seemed like years of escalation, I had reached the final stair to a door covered in illegible writing. It was as if someone had taken charcoal and scribbled orderly onto every square inch of the thing. An unholy smell incensed the door as well as a soft trickle of those spores came from beneath it. I, losing the fight of intuition and resilience against my new symbiote, turned the handle and stepped into the following room. It was well lit and curiously perfect.¬†¬†

Strangely enough, there was a ‚Äúpreceding‚Äù in the session. It was an extreme contrast. Within this, near-rubble church, there is this perfectly preserved room. The ceiling was still bare wood and it lacked furniture, yet if scientific laws would allow it, I‚Äôd say it was larger on the inside than the outside allotted. Very little light entered up here other than from a circular vent that let out the heat. I still don‚Äôt fully grasp this factor but there were close to mummified people atop the attic‚Äôs carpet.¬†

Where they sat in prayer seemed molded and stained to their form as a piece of furniture would. I observed their lifeless yet deeply focused state. Hitting my head on the claustrophobic room‚Äôs ceiling, I walk towards the ‚Äúpriest‚Äù. He was simply the best-dressed one and the only one standing. My body had squirmed away from the man subconsciously but there was still a clawing need to continue.¬†

He spoke not to me, hell looking back, I don‚Äôt even know if he would‚Äôve been able to. His lips were cracked and dried then cracked again, his eyes almost appeared to have both glossed over and widened; like a well preserved taxidermy. He was dressed in his ‚ÄúSunday Best‚Äù, if not torn and coated in a thin film of dust. It took until now for me to realize my ‚Äúintuition‚Äù brought me here before even reading the pages of that manuscript found within the walls of my home.¬†

As my hand hit my pocket to withdraw the revolting odored pages, the priest quickly grabbed my wrist in defiance. His hand was cold to the touch and gripped with enough force to genuinely hurt. I still feel the wrinkles of his form against my wrist as well as the pain from his bony and coarse hand. It felt like the texture I‚Äôd imagine the tress around this place would. Right after he latched on to my wrist, I wretched away and pushed on his torso to break free. He screamed as loud as he could muster; his voice breaking and shrilling to volumes and notes it was not meant to hit as though an enraged brass instrument. Even now I can still hear the *dryness* of his yell‚Äì so devoid of moisture that it sounded as though he was being burned alive. I quickly yanked myself away harder due to the further instilled fear of him not releasing me.¬†

He moved almost entirely to my will and damn near fell over when I jerked away. His ashen self shrilled once more as he cracked and twisted his way towards me; those cursed eyes now engulfed in deep rage and agony. He was only just beginning his pursuit as I had already slammed the attic door shut.

Frantically, I scuttled down the stairs as fast as my muscles could muster through the thin fog and my dreary eyed vision. My throat was on fire as I ran hard. My ankles felt every impact against the floor. It might have been the adrenaline but the walls seemed to stretch and yawn further out to hold me within short distance of that man. The burning sensation in my eyes and lungs were tri-fold that of chlorine as I frantically and blindly sprinted.¬†

In my swiftness, I had failed to locate the entrance to the worshiper‚Äôs building. I had somehow found myself in one of the back most rooms of the church. With a solid THUD against the adjacent wall and metastatic pain traveling from the collision, I had my momentum cut short. My panicked run had stopped.¬†

Concerningly, I could feel something happening inside my skull. I understand the impossibility of this yet I could *feel* it traveling around my brain and constricting. It was growing from further inhalation. Steadying myself I tried to ignore the sinewy strands it had connection to my neurons and nerves. This was idiotic of me in hindsight, but I had my mind set on ridiculous things. I pulled out the manuscript for analysis, in assumption that the husk priest wouldn‚Äôt dare make the trek I had just accomplished. It wasn‚Äôt in any language known to mankind. It was, however, in the same one as the attic door.

Very few pages were written in and it seemed to be extremely organized. The arabesque writing must have taken so long to transcribe onto the yellowish paper‚Äì unraveling its strange letters from the center of the page into intricate patterns. I thumb through the pages and notice a recurring pattern.¬†

Each page it looked like the writer had to try harder, and harder, and harder to write. The handwriting slowly got stiffer, and worse, then finally firm and barbaric enough to break the lead, stab through the paper, or imprint the subsequent page. Strangely, an author was credited on the very last written page in clear English. I didn‚Äôt understand why at the time. However the name would be etched into my brain until my final hour. For it was the name of my father.¬†

I couldn‚Äôt believe my eyes. I blinked hard and wondered if my mind was playing tricks on me in the opaque air. They did not deceive, however. I scanned the room for escape as I pondered the implication of this. Pacing around pseudo aimlessly, I wondered if my father had slowly lost it due to this thing currently claiming me as its own. Maybe my mother had gone mad searching for him and fell under the same suggestions. Who were those mummified in the attic? I wonder wh-

I almost tripped on a handle to a trap door that my pacing brought my foot into contact with. With my regained balance came more unbearable constrictions. The agony became deeper entrenched by every thought I didn‚Äôt claim ownership to. I was still recovering from the searing pain of its beckoning when it reached out my fingers to grasp the handle.¬†

I tried to reel my hand back but it kept reaching *serpently* towards the bent metal. I had front row seats to the puppeteering of my own body. The guest had past suggestion, it now was struggling to learn how to control my tendons and muscles‚Äì loosely jostling around before tightening one tendon, then another. It was using me as a testing ground while all I could do was stare in bemused shock.¬†

Learning quite quickly, it buckled my knees with a sickening *crack*. I shrieked in pain as I fell down face first onto the door, the handle now firmly placed under my diaphragm. I gasped to regain my breath as it jerked me back straight and quickly ripped open the trap door. When the door opened all I saw was an impossible and absolute darkness. I tried to protest but the symbiote already excitedly let go of the strings as it relaxed every tissue in my body to slug into the void below.

As my whole body singed with the needle-tip feeling of¬† an asleep limb, my world went black. I couldn‚Äôt see the bottom of the hole from above but it clearly wasn‚Äôt far of a fall. I landed on a mound of petrified humans and rolled down the curve of the hill, hideous twig snapping noises accompanying my fall. The trap door acted as an event horizon to whatever ungodly realm I resided‚Äì the transitional whiplash stronger than waking up from plummeting to the Earth during a dream.¬†

As I work parallel with the tenant to stand at the bottom of the frail petrified bodies, I can truly gaze upon this place. What little brain I can still call mine almost unraveled and promptly scrambled at the unsightliness. Aeons old stacks of mummified masses of flesh lined the horizon like distant mountain ranges, which never seemed to fully end or leave my sight.¬†

I gazed upon an endless plain of putrid aromas and corpses. The little ground I could stand on was an ankle deep river of crimson blood‚Äì oozing viscously. The crimson quality was more adjacent to blackness than to any color. It was an impossible feeling to be wading through blood. The constant noise of agonized groans rang endlessly through the sub zero plane. I knew why the symbiote had wanted me here so badly only because it began cooing and swiveling around in my cranium in a devilishly happy manor.

The fully adapted puppeteer within my nerves commanded a march forward through the otherworldly  state. I let it gleefully place one foot after another down the direction the blood pooled. I breathed the noxious air rapidly as I seared the monochrome scene into my memory. At this point I couldn‚Äôt tell if it was the symbiote or me coming up with these thoughts but I gathered this:

This is no church basement. That was simply a portal to another realm. I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that this was some man‚Äôs attempt to cheat nature. I was on Wrath‚Äôs door and these were souls long gone. The perfume that has coated the branching paths within my lungs for hours now must have been placed to ward just that‚Äì those seeking a break in natural order. Perhaps these were aliens from deep galaxies that managed to find a nectar it adored through human blood. All of these bodies would be people from different stretches of time giving into the insight the spores poses. Dante Alighieri or Yuggoth‚Äôs spawn, I knew this was truly hell.¬†

I snapped back into reality. Clearly, this frightened the creature inside me because I felt it cling onto the back of my brain cavity for safety. This sudden loss of motor stimuli made me descend face first into the sludged mixture of the blood of millions. I stand on my knees and palms gasping for air shortly after. The substance latched onto my form and slowly trickled off like a wretched honey, coating me in a tinge of iron and rot. I hurriedly tried to wipe off my face but given how totally the blood coated me, I was beyond a brow swipe with my forearm.¬†

I stood by my own command. The being hissed and quickly reared control back in a toddler‚Äôs desperation to get a toy from a peer. Having my mind shattered by the scene of this place left what little real estate I owned up there definitively shell shocked. I just ran. For once I knew my life depended on me not following this THING not a second longer. I had the answers. I had bitten the fruit. Now I need to make sure I‚Äôm the last willing participant in its twisted game.

It had walked an easy 200 yards from our initial mound and I was going to remove all of its progress. Darting back towards the church latch‚Äôs approximate area, I fought a game of tug of war within my own body. With every pound of my chest and distance gained, it too contorted my limbs in an attempt to fight.¬†

I struggle to transition my extremities through the stages of a run; my every move was weighed down by the being stiffening my limbs. I would stretch my left leg to make distance and it would purposefully cramp my right thigh to ward further rebellion. It couldn‚Äôt fight my desperation to leave before it fossilized me alive. All it could muster was desperate cracking of my bones and sickening contortions of my muscles. My lungs felt as though I were tenderizing them with every shallow breath. My rib‚Äôs stitched and screamed in anger. As did the creature. It had lost its cheerful demeanor and is no more than ravenous hatred now. The string-pulling demon did much to hinder my progress to where this realm began.¬†

I was dragged apart in two directions and it felt like I was being ripped in two. Reaching the mound, I began digging my fingers into whatever would hold my weight as well as my heels. Squelching and screaming agony of people whose eyes or stomachs served as a stepping stool up this rock climb was the least of my concerns. By this point the creature craved nothing more than my downfall. My ears rung with the fiery of unknown worlds whilst it delivered crippling blows by latching onto and twisting my nerves. I curl into the fetal position while barely clinging onto someone‚Äôs arm, almost losing my progress on the way up. Shrilling in pain, I continue climbing the human hill defying the creature‚Äôs cramping muscles and squeezing my brain.

I finally reached the top of the now symphony of agony that was that hellish stack of flesh, I did not hesitate. I squatted to try and get the most height I could muster from the subsequent leap upwards. I reached out as far as my wingspan could manage. Feeling this, the creature decided to play its last ace. It curled my fingers so I couldn‚Äôt grasp onto the trap door‚Äôs lip. I was airborne for what seemed like an eternity. I could feel my fingers begin to move as I reached out into the void. I was sure that I was going to be the next putrefied. Before I could fully amend the being‚Äôs retaliation, it was too late. It curled my hand around the edge of the trap door.

Now squirming my full body, I BARELY managed my way back into that ancient ‚Äúchurch‚Äù. I lift myself onto the carpeted floor just to dash into another room. By this point I could swear the building was alive. The walls were now fully decayed and seemed to breathe. Whatever facade it was using to toy with me it now ceased. I think it knew that it had secured its prey. I just need to delay the inevitable.¬†

The church yet again seemed to coil away and rip my chances of finding somewhere. I stand in horror as the being continued to writhe and swirl itself around my brain. I saw the ending of the church that I had lost so long ago. The first foot I set further into that hall was the final straw of the spore‚Äôs domain. It served one final yawn away‚Äì becoming smaller, and smaller, further and further away from me as the exit eventually disappeared from my sight. Now hundreds of miles away I had no choice but to spend my final hours in this house who worshiped a dimension of pain and suffering.

I looked frantically around. The symbiote once again cooed in pleasure and giddiness. I quickly went into the closest room to write. Coated in aeon old blood, spores, becoming stiff and constantly having my very skin being tugged towards the door of this damn room, I write in that odourful notebook that I found in my wall. I pray it doesn‚Äôt figure out how to dismantle my barricade before I‚Äôm finished. This is what I believe must be true: my father was never mentally ill. It was always that damned church. He was a stronger fighter than I, therefore lived far longer than I had after initial infection and succumbed later. My mother must have tried to follow his footsteps. She tried to save me, fighting both me and the fungus. She destroyed the creature‚Äôs new toy and tried to hide this notebook. I‚Äôm barely able to write and each word the being stabs yet another bore into my brain. I won‚Äôt be able to fight it much longer. I will be in a hell worse than death.¬†

As for you, I hope you can do what‚Äôs right. I wrote more information than needed to coax you into waiting. You can probably feel the thing in there now, can‚Äôt you? I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs quite smart enough to comprehend this message. You know what must be done. Burn this place to the ground with you inside. Maybe it writhing around will persuade you better than my words. I think if you destroy the pestilence‚Äôs maw, you could be the last one it ever digests. You know what must be done. It‚Äôs too late. I‚Äôm sorry.

¬† ""Oh, this doesn't sound like a good idea,"" Claire said, looking down at the paper that had been shoved into her hand by a passing student. She paused in the shade of the Science Building porch to read it. Only idiots stood around in full sun at Texas Prairie University in the middle of the afternoon--well, idiots and football players--so Claire angled herself into a corner where she wouldn't get buffeted by the streams of people pouring out after the end of class. There were a few hardy salmon trying to swim upstream, but she didn't think they'd make it.  
  
¬† People all around her were carrying the same goldenrod sheet of paper she had--stuffed into pockets, crammed into books, held in hands.  
  
¬† She was one of the last ones to get pamphleted, she guessed. She was just a little surprised anybody had bothered at all, given the fact that she, Claire Danvers, was small for her age, looked younger than her mid-seventeen-going-hard-on-eighteen years, and tended to blend into the crowd at the best of times. This even though her ultra-fashion-conscious housemate Eve--with all the best possible intentions--had made her sit down in the bathroom and get her brown hair all highlighted so it glowed red in the sun. Still, she just wasn't . . . noticeable.  
  
¬† She'd learned it the hard way: early admission to college sucked.  
  
¬† Someone stopped next to her in the relative quiet of the shade. It was a tall, good-looking boy, and he dropped his backpack on the tiled floor with a thump as he looked over the same flyer she held. ""Huh,"" he said, and glanced over at her. ""You going?""  
  
¬† Once she got over the dazzle of his good looks (truthfully, it didn't take that long; her boyfriend was just as cute), she checked his wrist. He was a Morganville native; he was wearing a bracelet around one wrist made out of copper and leather, with an ornate-looking symbol engraved on the central plate. It meant he was vampire property--property of Ming Cho, who was one of those vampires that Claire had never directly run into. She liked it that way. Really, her circle of vampire acquaintances was way, way too large as it was.  
  
¬† ""Hey,"" he said again, and rattled the paper in front of her face. ""Anybody in there? You going?""  
  
¬† Claire looked down at the paper again. It had a bunch of pictures and symbols on it, no words. A musical note, which meant a rave was on the menu. Some pictures of party favors, which meant that mostly illegal stuff was going to be floating around. The address was coded in the form of a riddle, which she solved easily enough; it was an address on South Rackham, among all those decaying warehouses that used to be thriving businesses. The time was pretty obvious: midnight. That was what the graphic of the witch was for--the witching hour. The date was several days away.  
  
¬† ""Not interested,"" she said, and handed him her copy. ""Not my thing. ""  
  
¬† ""Too bad. It's going to be out there. ""  
  
¬† ""That's why. "" He laughed. ""You a training-wheels partyer?""  
  
¬† ""I'm not much of a partyer at all,"" Claire said, and couldn't help but smile; he had a really nice laugh, one that made you want to laugh with it. He wasn't laughing at her, at least. That was different. ""Hi, by the way. I'm Claire. ""  
  
¬† ""Alex,"" he said. ""You coming from Chem?""  
  
¬† ""No, Computational Physics. ""  
  
¬† ""Oh,"" he said, and blinked. ""And I have no idea what that is. Right, carry on, Einstein. Nice to meet you. ""  
  
¬† He picked up his backpack and moved off before she could even explain about many-body and nonlinear physical systems. Yeah, that would have really impressed him. Instead of walking away, he'd have been running.  
  
¬† She felt a little hurt, but only a little. At least he'd talked to her. That was ninety-nine percent better than her usual score with college guys, except the ones who wanted to do something terrible to her. Those guys were very chatty.  
  
¬† Claire squinted against the bright sunshine and looked out onto the courtyard. The big open brick space was clearing, although there were, as always, a knot of people around the central column where flyers were posted for rides, rooms, parties, and various services and causes. She had time before her next class--about an hour--but hiking all the way to the University Center coffee bar in the unseasonable late-autumn heat didn't sound attractive. She'd get there, have maybe half an hour, and then she'd have to walk another long way to get to her next class.  
  
¬† TPU really needed to look into mass transit.  
  
¬† The Science Building was closer to the edge of campus than most of the other buildings, so it was actually a shorter walk to one of the four exit gates, across the street, and then to Common Grounds, the off-campus coffeehouse. Of course, it was owned by a vampire, and not a nice one, either, but in Morganville, you couldn't be too choosy about those kinds of things if you valued your caffeine. Or your blood.  
  
¬† Besides, Oliver could mostly be trusted. Mostly.  
  
¬† Decision made, Claire grabbed her heavily laden book bag and set off in the withering sunshine for Vampire Central.  
  
¬† It was always funny to her now--walking through town she could tell which people were ""in the know"" about Morganville, and which weren't. The ones who weren't mostly looked bored and unhappy, stuck in a nothing-doing small town that rolled up the side-walks at dusk.  
  
¬† The ones who did know still looked unhappy, but in that hunted, haunted way. She didn't blame them, not at all; she'd been through the entire adjustment cycle, from shock to disbelief to acceptance to misery. Now she was just . . . comfortable. Surprising, but true. It was a dangerous place, but she knew the rules.  
  
¬† Even if she didn't always obey the rules.  
  
¬† Her cell phone rang as she was crossing the street--the Twilight Zone theme. That meant it was her boss. She looked down at the screen, frowned, and shut it off without answering. She was pissed at Myrnin, again, and she didn't want to hear him go on, again, about why she was wrong about the machine they were building.  
  
¬† He wanted to put a human brain in it. So not happening. Myrnin was crazy, but normally it was a good crazy, not a creepy crazy. Lately he seemed to be pushing the far end of the creep-o-meter, though. She seriously wondered if she ought to get some vampire psychologist to look at him or something. They probably had someone who'd been around when Dr. Freud was just finishing medical school. Common Grounds was blessedly dim and cool, but mercilessly busy. There wasn't a free table to be had, which was depressing; Claire's feet hurt, and her shoulder was about to dislocate from the constant pull of her book bag. She found a corner and dumped the weight of knowledge (potential, anyway) with a sigh of relief and joined the line at the order window. There was a new guy working the counter, again, which didn't surprise Claire much; Oliver seemed to go through employees pretty quickly. She wasn't sure if that was just his strict nature or whether he was eating them. Either one was possible, but the latter wasn't likely, at least. Oliver was more careful than that, even if he didn't really want to be.  
  
¬† It took about five minutes to reach the front of the line, but Claire put in her order for a cafe mocha without much trouble, except that the new guy spelled her name wrong on the cup. She moved on down the counter, and when she looked up, Oliver was staring at her from behind the espresso machine as he pulled shots. He looked the same as always--aging hippie, graying hair pulled back in a classy-looking ponytail, one gold stud in his right ear, a coffee-splattered tie-dyed apron, and eyes like ice. With all the hippie-flavored details, you didn't tend to notice the pallor of his face or the coldness of his stare right away unless you already knew him.  
  
¬† In the next second, he smiled, and his eyes changed completely, like another person had just stepped into his body--the friendly coffee-shop guy he liked to pretend to be. ""Claire,"" he said, and finished dumping shots into her mocha cup. ""What a nice surprise. Sorry about the lack of seating. ""  
  
¬† ""I guess business is good. ""  
  
¬† ""Always. "" He knew  
how she liked the drink, and added whipped cream and sprinkles without asking before handing it over. ""I believe the frat boys by the window are about to leave. You can get a seat if you hurry. ""  
  
¬† He was right; she could see the preleaving preparations going on. Claire nodded her thanks and grabbed her bag, pushing between chairs and apologizing her way to the table so that she arrived just as the last frat boy grabbed his stuff and headed for the door. She was one of four who had aimed for the vacancy, and missed it by the length of one outstretched, well-manicured hand.  
  
¬† ""Excuse me, our table,"" Monica Morrell said, looking down at her with unconcealed delight. ""The junior skank section is over there, by the trash. Beat it. ""  
  
¬† The sister of Morganville's mayor sank down on one of the four chairs, flipping her shiny dark hair over her shoulders; she'd added some blond highlights to it again, but Claire didn't think they did her any favors. She'd accessorized with arm candy, though, in the form of a big linebacker-style guy with one of those faces that was beefy but still handsome. He was blond, which seemed to be Monica's new type, and (Claire knew from the one class she'd shared with him) dumb, which was always Monica's type. He was carrying Monica's coffee, which he put down in front of her before taking a seat next to her, close enough to drape his big arm around her shoulders and stare down her cleavage.  
  
¬† It would have been the safe thing to just back off and let Monica claim her petty victory, but Claire was really not in the mood. She wasn't afraid of Monica anymore--well, not normally--and the last thing she wanted to do was let Monica spoil the one thing she'd been looking forward to during the entire walk over: a decent seat in which to enjoy her drink.  
  
¬† So Claire put her cafe mocha down at the third place and sat down, just ahead of Jennifer, who was making for the space. Gina, Monica's other ever-present girlfriend/minion, had already taken the last seat.  
  
¬† Monica, oddly, didn't say anything. She stared at Claire as if she couldn't quite figure out what the hell that was doing sitting down at her table, and then, once she got over the shock, she smiled, as if it occurred to her that maybe this could be fun. In a nasty sort of way. Her new temporary boyfriend didn't seem to be noticing any of it as he smirked and did a virtual high five with some friends across the room.  
  
¬† Jennifer stood there glaring down at Claire, clearly not sure what to do, and Claire was acutely aware that she had her back to the girl. Never a good plan. She didn't trust any of them, but she trusted Jennifer least of all these days. Gina had kind of discovered humanity, in a vague sort of way, and Monica . . . well, Monica could usually be counted on to do what was good for Monica.  
  
¬† Jennifer was unpredictable, and six of the worst kinds of crazy. Gina was mean, and Monica could be vicious, but Jennifer didn't seem to have any sense of boundaries at all. Plus, Jennifer had been the first one of the three to push her. Claire hadn't forgotten that.  
  
¬† Claire sensed a movement at her back, and almost ducked, but she forced herself not to flinch. Nothing will happen, not here. Not in front of Oliver. It wasn't that Oliver was fond of her, exactly--only that he didn't like conflict inside of his business that he himself hadn't started.  
  
¬† Monica's eyes went to Jennifer--wide and a little odd, as if Jennifer spooked her, too. ""Jesus, Jen, get a grip,"" she said, which made Claire want to turn around and see whether the other girl was getting out a knife, but she managed to resist. ""Just get another chair. It's not rocket science. ""  
  
¬† Jennifer's tone of voice made it clear she was still glaring at the back of Claire's head. ""There aren't any. ""  
  
¬† ""Well? Go scare somebody out of one. It's what you do. ""  
  
¬† That was cold, even for Monica, and Claire suddenly felt uneasy about this. Maybe she should just . . . move on. She didn't want to be in the middle, because if Monica and Jennifer really went at it, the one in the middle was going to get killed.  
  
¬† But before she could decide what to do, she heard Jennifer walking away, toward a team of people studying in the corner with books and calculators and notes spread over every available table inch. She zeroed in on the biggest guy, tapped him on the shoulder, and whispered in his ear. He stood up. She grabbed his chair and carried it back with her, and the guy stood there in complete bafflement.  
  
¬† It was, Claire realized, a really good strategy. The guy didn't seem like the type to come and pick a fight over something that small, especially with a girl of Jennifer's size (and reputation). So he finally shrugged and stood there awkwardly, resigned to his fate.  
  
¬† Jennifer jammed the chair in between Monica and Claire and sat down. Monica and Gina clapped, and Jennifer, finally, stopped glaring and grinned, proud to have earned their approval.  
  
¬† It was just . . . sad.  
  
¬† Claire shook her head. She still wanted to sit down and rest, but it really wasn't worth the small victory to be part of this. She stood up, grabbed her chair, and towed it across the crowded room to slide it next to the guy Jennifer had stolen the chair from, who was still standing. ""Here,"" she said. ""I'm leaving anyway. ""  
  
¬† Now he really looked confused. So did Monica and her Monickettes, as if the concept of givebacks had never crossed their path before. Claire sighed, shifted the weight of her backpack, and prepared to leave, mocha in hand.  
  
¬† ""Hey!"" Monica's grip on her elbow dragged her to a stop. ""What the hell? I want you to stay!""  
  
¬† ""Why?"" Claire asked, and jerked her arm free. ""So you can needle me for an hour? Are you really that bored?""  
  
¬† Monica looked even more confused. Nobody ever turned down being part of the queen bee's inner circle. After that second of vulnerability, though, her face hardened. ""Don't diss me, Danvers. I'm warning you. ""  
  
¬† ""I'm not dissing you. "" Claire sighed. ""I'm ignoring you. There's a difference. Dissing you implies I think you're actually important. ""  
  
¬† As she walked out, she heard someone behind her laugh and clap. They were quickly hushed, but it still warmed her just a little. She didn't often get up in Monica's grille that directly, but she was sick of the games. Monica just needed to move on and find somebody else to poke her pins into.  
  
¬† The mocha was still delicious. Maybe even just a little bit more delicious for being outside in the open air, come to think of it. Claire nodded to a few people she knew on the street, all of them permanent residents, and strolled down the block. She wasn't in the mood to shop for clothes, but the little faded bookstore farther down beckoned her.  
  
¬† Book Mad was a dusty hole-in-the-wall, crammed floor to ceiling with stacks of volumes in--as far as Claire had ever been able to tell--only a vague sense of order. Generally, nonfiction was at the front and fiction at the back, but you really could never tell. The stacks never seemed to get any smaller, nor was the dust ever disturbed, but she was always finding new stuff she hadn't seen before.  
  
¬† That was weirdly entertaining.  
  
¬† ""Hi, Claire,"" said the proprietor, Dan, a tall guy about her father's age. He was thin and a little nerdy, but that might just have been the glasses, which were either wickedly retro or seriously lame; Claire could never decide. He had on a funny T-shirt, as usual. Today's featured a cartoon figure running from a giant T. rex, and it read EXERCISE: SOME MOTIVATION REQUIRED. She tried not to smile, but lost the battle. It really was funny. ""Got some physics stuff that just came in. It's over there. "" He gestured vaguely off into the distance. Claire nodded.  
  
¬† ""Hey,"" she said. ""Where do you get the books? I mean, they're old. Some of them are really kind of ancient. ""  
  
¬† He shrugged and looked down at the antique register on the counter, and brushed some dust off the keys. ""Oh, you know. Around. ""  
  
¬† ""From a storage room in the library? Maybe on the fourth floor?"" She had him. He looked up at her, eyes narrowing. ""I've been in there. I was wondering what they were going to do with all that stuff once they were done with it. So, who gives you the books?""  
  
¬† ""I don't know what you're talking about,"" Dan said, and all the warmth was gone suddenly. He looked uncomfortable and suspicious, and the funny T-shirt suddenly did  
n't fit his mood at all. ""Let me know if you find anything you want. ""  
  
¬† The fourth floor of the school's library had been a locked maze of boxes of old books, gathered from who-knew-where by the vampires. At the time Claire had visited--well, broken in--vampires (no doubt reporting to Amelie, the town's Founder) had been combing through looking for one particular book. She'd wondered what they'd planned to do with all the rest once their quest was finished.  
  
¬† Naturally, it turned out Amelie was making money off of the extra books. Vampires were nothing if not practical.  
  
¬† As Claire was thumbing through the dusty stacks, squinting to read faded titles, occasionally sneezing from the smell of old paper, she found a slim, leather-bound volume that was still in pretty good condition. No title on the spine, so she pulled it out and looked at the front. Nothing on the front, either.  
  
¬† Inside, on the first page under a sheet of old onionskin, was a black-and-white photograph of Amelie. Claire blinked and took her time looking; yes, it really was her. The Founder of Morganville looked young and fragile, with her white-gold hair piled up in a complicated style on top of her head that showed off her very long, elegant neck. She wore a black dress, something from the 1800s, Claire guessed, with lots of sleeve and tons of skirts and petticoats. There was something about her eyes--the photograph had made them even lighter than the icy gray they usually were.  
  
¬† It was deeply spooky.  
  
¬† Claire flipped a page and read the title:  
  
¬† A HISTORY OF MORGANVILLE  
  
¬† Its Important Citizens and Events  
  
¬† A Chronicle of Our Times  
  
¬† She blinked. Surely they hadn't meant for this to end up in the used bookstore, where anybody could pick it up and find it. She'd never seen anything like it before.  
  
¬† And, of course, she had to have it. She'd been burning up with curiosity about Amelie ever since she'd met her; the Founder seemed to have so many secrets that it was hard to know where they started and stopped. Even though Amelie had, from time to time, helped her out, and had given her Protection that had saved her life at one time, Claire really didn't know that much about her, except that she was old, regal, and scary.  
  
¬† The penciled price on the inside of the cover was only five dollars. She quickly found a few more obscure science titles, buried the history in the stack, and hauled the books up to the front.  
  
¬† Dan snorted. ""You're never going to cram all that in your backpack. ""  
  
¬† ""Yeah, probably not,"" she agreed. ""Could I have a sack?""  
  
¬† ""What do I look like, Piggly Wiggly? Hang on. "" He rooted around behind the counter, sending up choking clouds of dust that made even him cough, and finally handed over a battered old canvas bag. She started counting out money, and he quickly flipped open the books and added up the totals. He wasn't paying attention, which was good; he just added it up and said, ""Twenty-seven fifty. ""  
  
¬† That was an awful lot, pretty much all she had at the moment, but she kept smiling and handed it over. As soon as the cash had left her palm, she grabbed the bag and started stuffing things inside.  
  
¬† ""What's your hurry?"" he asked, counting out the fives and ones. ""It's not close to sundown. ""  
  
¬† ""Class,"" she said. ""Thanks. ""  
  
¬† He nodded, opened the register, and put the cash inside. She felt him watching her all the way to the door. It occurred to her that she didn't know which vampire owned this business, or how he or she might feel about the sale of the book . . . but she couldn't worry about that now.  
  
¬† She really did have class.

TWO  
  
¬† It didn't take long at all to read the book. She stopped in a park on the way home and sat in a sun-faded rubber swing seat and rocked slowly back and forth as she flipped pages.  
  
¬† It was about people she'd never heard of . . . and people she knew. Amelie, for one. Amelie's disputes with various vampires. Amelie's decisions to sentence this person for his crimes, spare that one. There were other vampires profiled, too. Some she'd never heard of; she supposed that they'd died, or left, or maybe they were just reclusive. Oliver wasn't in the book, because he was a latecomer to town. Neither, curiously, was Myrnin. She supposed Myrnin had been a closely guarded town secret from the very beginning.  
  
¬† It was weirdly interesting, but overall, she didn't know what good it was going to do her to know that Amelie had once filed a complaint against a man who owned a dry-goods store (what was a dry-goods store?) for cheating the human customers. And that the complaint had gotten his store taken away from him, and he'd opened the town's first movie theater.  
  
¬† Boring.  
  
¬† In the end, Claire dropped the book into her backpack and thought about mailing it anonymously to the library. Maybe that was where it really belonged, anyway. She thought about it on the way home, but she ended up worrying about whether vampires could somehow sense she'd handled it. CSI: Vampire. Not a comforting thought.  
  
¬† ""You're late,"" Michael remarked, as she walked into the Glass House through the kitchen door. He was standing at the sink washing dishes; there was nothing odder to her than seeing her housemate, who was all kinds of smoking-hot, not to mention all kinds of vampire, up to his elbows in suds at the sink. Did rock stars really do their own housework? ""Also, it's not my day to do the kitchen. It's yours. ""  
  
¬† ""Is that your passive-aggressive way of trying to get me to pick up your laundry duty?""  
  
¬† ""I don't know. Is it working?""  
  
¬† ""Maybe. "" She put her bags down on the table and went to join him at the sink. He washed plates and handed them over, and she rinsed and dried. Very domestic. ""I was reading. I forgot what time it was. ""  
  
¬† ""Bookworm. "" He flicked suds at her. Michael was in a really good mood, no question about that; he had been for the last couple of months. Getting out of Morganville and recording his music with a real, genuine recording company had been good for him. Coming back had been hard, but he'd finally settled into the routine. They all had. It had been a crazy, weird vacation, almost like something they'd dreamed, Claire decided.  
  
¬† But damn, it had felt good to be out there with her friends, on the road, without the shadow of Morganville hanging over them.  
  
¬† Michael abruptly stopped laughing, and just looked at her with those big blue eyes. That made her go momentarily dizzy, and she felt a blush coming on. Not that he was flirting with her--not more than normal--but he was looking at her a lot more deeply than usual, and he didn't blink.  
  
¬† Finally he did, turning his attention back to the sink, and washed another plate before he said, ""You're nervous about something. Your heartbeat's faster than normal. ""  
  
¬† ""You can hear--Oh. Of course you can. "" He hadn't been staring at her so much as the blood moving through her veins, she thought. And that was kind of creepy, except it was Michael. He made creepy adorable, most of the time. ""I ran part of the way home; that's probably it. ""  
  
¬† ""Hey, if you don't want to tell me, don't. But I can tell when you lie. ""  
  
¬† Okay, that was supercreepy. ""You can?""  
  
¬† He smiled grimly down at the dirty dishwater. ""Nope. But see? You fell for it anyway. Careful, or I'll read your mind with my incredible vampire superpowers. ""  
  
¬† She sighed and wiped her hands as he pulled the plug on the dishwater and let it swirl away into the dark. The kitchen looked like someone actually cared. She really did owe him laundry, probably.  
  
¬† Claire tossed him the dish towel. ""That was a mean trick. ""  
  
¬† ""Yeah, still a vampire. Spill it. ""  
  
¬† As he wiped his hands and arms free of suds, she opened up the bag on the table, rooted around to find the slim volume, and handed it over. He sank into a chair. As he looked it over, his eyebrows went up and up. ""Where'd you get this?""  
  
¬† ""The used bookstore,"" she said. ""I don't think Dan--you know, the guy who runs it--knew it was there. Or if he did, maybe it's--I don't know--full of lies? But that's a picture of Amelie, right?""  
  
¬† ""I didn't know there were any, but that's definitely one. "" Michael closed the book and handed it back. ""Maybe it's Morganville propaganda. Seems like Amelie's done that from time to time, in which case, no big deal. But if it's not--""  
  
¬† ""If it's the real history of Morganville, then I should take it to Amelie before I get in trouble. Yeah, thanks, Dad. Already figured that one out. ""  
  
¬† He leaned forward on his elbows and grinned. ""You are a difficult kid. But a smart one. ""  
  
¬† ""Not a kid,"" she said, and shot him the finger, just like Eve or Shane would have done. ""Hey, who's on dinner patro--""  
  
¬† Before she could finish the last word, the front door banged open, and Eve's cheery voice echoed down the hall. ""Hellooooo, creatures of the night! Put your pants back on! Food's here, and I don't mean me!""  
  
¬† Michael pointed mutely in that direction.  
  
¬† ""Tell me she's not bringing leftover sandwiches from the University Center,"" Claire moaned as Eve burst into the kitchen door with a white paper bag in hand.  
  
¬† ""I heard that,"" Eve said, and opened the refrigerator to dump the bag inside. ""I got you the bacteria special; I know how much you like that. The UC kitchen staff sends their love. Whassup, dead guy?""  
  
¬† ""Not dead yet,"" Michael said, and rose to kiss her. Except for the cool bluish tone to his skin, he looked like any other boy of nineteen; the sharp, pointy teeth were folded up, like a snake's, and when he was like this Claire actually kind of forgot he was a vamp at all. Although he was wearing a faded T-shirt that had a happy face on it, with vampire fangs. Eve had probably bought it for him.  
  
¬† Eve herself had to stand just a bit on tiptoe for the kiss, which went on about five seconds too long for it to be just hi-honey-welcome-home, and when they parted, Eve's cheeks were flushed even under the white Goth makeup. After a hard day of pulling shots at the TPU coffee shop--she alternated now between there and Common Grounds--she still looked cheerful and alert. Maybe it was all that caffeine. It just soaked right into her body without her even having to drink it. She was wearing black tights with orange pumpkins on them--left over from Halloween, Claire assumed, but Halloween was a year-round holiday for Eve--a tight black skirt, and three layers of thin shirts, each a different color. The one on top was sheer black, with a sad-eyed pirate skull printed on it.  
  
¬† ""I like the new earrings,"" Claire said. They were silver skulls, and the little eye sockets lit up red whenever Eve turned her head. ""They're you. ""  
  
¬† ""I know, right? Couldn't be cooler. "" Eve beamed. ""Oh, and actually, they were out of the bacteria special, so I got you the ham and cheese. That's usually the safest one. ""  
  
¬† Safe being a relative term when it came to UC food. ""Thanks,"" Claire said. ""Tomorrow I'm making spaghetti. Yes, before you ask, with meat sauce. Carnivores. ""  
  
¬† Eve made a chomping sound with her teeth. Michael just smiled. The smile faded as he asked, ""You don't have to go see Amelie tonight, do you?""  
  
¬† ""No, probably not. The book's been sitting in that shop for who knows how long. It can wait until tomorrow. I have to go to the lab anyway. Amelie will be a nice break, after my mandatory crazy-boss time. "" Eve got herself a cold Coke from the fridge and popped the top as she dragged Claire's bag off of a chair and dumped it in the corner. ""How is crazy boss man, anyway?""  
  
¬† ""Myrnin's . . . well, Myrnin, I guess. He's been getting a little weird. ""  
  
¬† ""Sweetie, coming from you, that's alarming. You have an awfully large scale of weird. ""  
  
¬† ""I know. "" Claire sighed and sat down, propping her chin on both fists. She debated how much to say, even to her friends, but honestly, there weren't any secrets. Not in the Glas  
s House. ""I think he's under a lot of pressure to get the machine fixed; you know the one--""  
  
¬† ""Ada?"" Eve asked. ""Ugh, seriously, he's not bringing that back to life, is he?""  
  
¬† ""Not . . . exactly, no. But Ada wasn't all bad, you know. Well, Ada was, the personality, but the machine did all kinds of things that the vamps need, like maintain the borders of the town, give alerts when residents leave, wipe memories when they want it done . . . and run the portals. "" The portals were the dimensional doorways that ran through town. Myrnin had discovered some freaky way of accelerating particles and constructing stable tunnels through space-time, something that Claire was still struggling to understand, let alone master. It wasn't quite magic, but sometimes there didn't seem to be much of a boundary between magic and Myrnin's science. ""It's important. We're just trying to, you know, take the Ada factor out of the equation and get the mechanical piece working without the mind-of-its-own part. ""  
  
¬† ""Killer computers. "" Eve sighed. ""Like we didn't have enough trouble in Morganville already. I'm not so sure any of those things you're talking about are good for us, Claire Bear. You feel me?""  
  
¬† ""If by us you mean the regular humans, yeah, I know. But""-- Claire shrugged--""fact is, having those safeguards lets them trust us, at least a little, and trust is all that keeps this town going. ""  
  
¬† Eve didn't have a comeback to that. She knew Claire was right. Morganville existed on a teetering, dangerous balance between the paranoia and violence of the vampires, and the paranoia and violence of the humans who outnumbered them. Right there, at the balance point, they could all coexist. But it didn't take much to tilt things to one side or the other, and if that happened, Morganville would burn.  
  
¬† Claire chewed her lip and continued. ""We're getting it done; really, we are, but he's got some kind of deadline he's not telling me about, and I'm worried he's going to . . . do something crazy. ""  
  
¬† ""He lives in a hole in the ground, dresses funny, and occasionally eats his assistants,"" Eve said. ""Define crazy. ""  
  
¬† Claire closed her eyes. ""Okay. I think he wants to put my brain in a jar and wire it into the machine. ""  
  
¬† Dead silence. She opened her eyes. Michael was staring at her, frozen in the act of opening the refrigerator door; Eve had put her Coke down, her eyes as wide as anything ever drawn in animation. Michael finally remembered what he was doing, reached in, grabbed a green sports bottle, which he carried to the table, and sat down. ""That's not going to happen,"" he said. ""I'm not going to let it happen. Neither will Amelie. ""  
  
¬† Claire wasn't so sure about that last part, but she was sure Michael meant what he said, and that made her feel a little better. ""I don't think he's serious about it,"" Claire said weakly. ""Well, not most of the time. But he keeps going on about how the brain is a much better CPU--""  
  
¬† ""Not going to happen,"" Michael repeated flatly. ""I'll kill him first, Claire. I mean it. ""  
  
¬† She didn't want Myrnin dead, but it did make her feel better to have her friend say it. Michael was a sweetheart most of the time, but the truth was, there was something cold inside him--and it wasn't just that his heart didn't beat. It was . . . something else. Something darker. Mostly, it didn't show.  
  
¬† Sometimes, she was grateful it did.  
  
¬† ""Shane's late,"" Eve said, changing the subject. ""Where's Mr. Barbecue McStabby?""  
  
¬† ""Working late,"" Claire replied. ""Somebody canceled on the night shift, so he had to work dinner service. He said it was okay; he could use the overtime. And he doesn't like you to call him Mr. McStabby, you know. ""  
  
¬† ""Have you ever seen him cutting up that meat? He is like an artist with slicing. And that knife is as long as my arm. Mr. McStabby it is. ""  
  
¬† They debated it for a while, with Michael staying out of it and sipping his sports bottle of--probably--blood, until Eve got the sandwiches out and they ate a cold, and somewhat mushy, dinner. After that, Claire fidgeted around, too restless to study, missing Shane, until Eve finally snapped at her about pacing and moving stuff, and she went up toward her room.  
  
¬† On an impulse, she didn't go there; she stopped in the hallway, reached out, and found the hidden catch to the secret room. The paneling clicked open, and she went in and shut the door behind her. No knob on this side, but that was okay; she knew where the release was. She ran up the narrow flight of stairs and came out in the windowless, dusty room that they'd always figured had been Amelie's retreat, when she'd once lived in this house. It looked like her, somehow--old Victorian furniture, tapestry hangings, multicolored Tiffany lamps that were probably worth a fortune. It was always a little cold in here, for some reason. Claire stretched out on the old velvet sofa, staring up at the ceiling, and thought about how many times she'd come here with Shane. It was their private place, where they could just get away from everything, and the blanket draped over the back smelled like him. She pulled it over her and smiled, feeling like the ghost of Shane was here with her, snuggling up close.

1mqcah0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Petloss/comments/1mqcah0/sign_from_my_soul_cat/,Sign from my soul cat,"I recently posted here about a sudden loss of my babygirl which was very shocking to me as the evening before she was playing, running around and the next morning we found her on the floor and it was too late to do anything. Since then I‚Äôve been a total wreck and I feel like I‚Äôve been living in a nightmare. 

Right after her passing my house keys went missing and I‚Äôm 100% sure they went missing in the house. I am thinking maybe she took them with her and I really hope it‚Äôs true. 

Today morning when I was crying I asked her to give me a sign that she‚Äôs okay and that she‚Äôs with me. 
We had scheduled a trip a long time before for today to visit my grandparents who live about 8 hours from us. During today‚Äôs ride I never put any music on even though I always do and normally I can‚Äôt imagine driving without it. I didn‚Äôt feel the need today and since the passing I haven‚Äôt listened to anything. I was even thinking that when she passed she took all the light and joy and music with her. 
About 4 hours into the drive we pulled up to a gas station and my boyfriend went out to get coffee. After few minutes suddenly my car blasted one specific song from my phone. I immediately turned it down a little since I got scared. 

(It was a song  (pitbull- I know you want me remix) from my very old SoundCloud account that I recently (about a week ago) remembered about. When I discovered my playlist I started showing some songs I used to listen to when I was younger to my boyfriend. That specific song he said he didn‚Äôt like and told me to turn off.)

I quickly checked my phone but the SoundCloud app wasn‚Äôt even on. I then listened to the whole thing cause it was still playing and I thought to myself that the song is gonna end right before my bf comes to the car. And guess what. When he put his foot out the gas station‚Äôs door- the song ended. 

Please tell me if you think it was a sign from her? Because I can‚Äôt imagine anything else and I‚Äôm going crazy.

1mqcacj,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/1mqcacj/cat_scratching_at_tv_constantly/,Cat Scratching at TV constantly,"Hi everyone, I currently have two cats, a brother and sister, that are just over a year old. I adopted them when they were 3 months old. The brother is quite large, about 13 pounds, (but not fat, just very long) and he‚Äôs really energetic and vocal. He is neutered. He used to play fetch with spring toys, and he loved wand toys, but for the past few months he‚Äôs just been scratching and batting at the TV while meowing nonstop.

It doesn‚Äôt seem to matter if it‚Äôs on or not, it‚Äôs just if I‚Äôm on the couch or close to see him. I can tell he‚Äôs trying to get my attention, but he does it even when he‚Äôs been fed, has clean, fresh water, and a clean litter box. I usually try to redirect him by initiating playtime, which sometimes works, but even then it only holds his attention for a little bit until he goes right back to attacking the TV. I‚Äôve tried just petting him and giving him over but that doesn‚Äôt do it either. 

I even got a really large cat tree for both of them to give them some more stimulation, which they love! Unfortunately, the obsession with the TV hasn‚Äôt stopped. I‚Äôve even tried getting up and leaving the room when he does it so I‚Äôm not accidentally rewarding the behavior, but the second I come back to the living area he starts again. I‚Äôve tried to pick him up and move him from the TV stand, but now it‚Äôs just become a fun game for him where he goes under the coffee table to hide, and then when I sit down he jumps right back onto the TV stand. 

It‚Äôs frustrating me because he‚Äôs scratching and smudging the screen which is whatever, but also if I‚Äôm trying to watch TV or play a video game, he‚Äôs so large that it blocks a huge chunk of the screen :(. It feels like most of our interactions are just from that now, and he doesn‚Äôt approach me for cuddles as much. Does anyone have any other ideas of why he could be doing this? I‚Äôm sure I made him think it was fun when I redirected him to playtime, but how can I break this habit? Are there other puzzle toys I could try for him maybe?

It's completely taken away my food noise, it's amazing, here's some of my victory's this week (that happened without me even trying!) And in brackets how I would have been previously.

-Haven't considered or even thought about a takeaway all week
(Would have ordered 2-4 takeaways a week)

- I ate one cookie this week really enjoyed it and was very content with the one, left the rest (Would get a bag of cookies and eat the entire thing, feel horribly sick but upset cause they were gone)

-Chocolate, crisps, ice cream, sweets ect don't interest me in the slightest, zero want for any of it. Theres been a tub of my favourite ben and jerrys in the fridge all week, untouched (ate junk food everyday and would make sure that I had it in the house at all times)

- I went to the cinemas today, brought a coffee in and had zero want or care for anything else (the cinema was only exciting because I could binge in the dark around others)

-I can shop with a clear head (overthinking everything, buying lots of 'good' food that would end up in the bin and rotting away, leading to shame about not being 'healthy' AND wasting food/money)

-I've had one or less coffee a day, about 3 cans of coke zero, 2ltrs of water a day (2-3 coffees a day, 2-3 coke zero cans a day and 0-1 small glasses of water) - just to name some!! 

It hasn't been all sunshine - it's been incredibly emotional. The food noise being taken away like that has left me in this very very weird headspace. I'm beyond happy, but my head is too quiet, it's left this ginormous empty space that's scary and unfamiliar, also has given me space to step back and realise how much it took over my life, which makes me very sad and angry. I've been counting calories and I'm glad I did as it's made me want to eat only half of my maintenance calories, which isn't enough! I've had to ensure I'm eating enough to fuel my body.

Anyway sorry for the wall of text, I'll do my official weigh tomorrow and will be taking my second dose 12 hours early as I took it in the morning the first day, but will take it before bed to hopefully sleep through the worst of it tonight! ",5,1755203421.0,Ozempic,0,1.0,False

1mqc8em,https://www.reddit.com/r/BehindThePlug/comments/1mqc8em/discover_if_the_best_blood_pressure_monitor_from/,Discover if the Best Blood Pressure Monitor from Ovutek Delivers,"Testing out the VBP441(F1701T) blood pressure monitor from Shenzhen Jamr Technology has been a fascinating experience for someone like me who juggles a busy daily routine while trying to stay on top of health metrics. Between frequent work hours and some old family health concerns, having this home-use blood pressure monitor feels almost like having a tiny medical assistant in your living space. It‚Äôs loaded with practical features, yet it‚Äôs not without a few quirks here and there. Here‚Äôs my first-hand review of this device based on personal use and comparisons.

**Design and Ease of Use**

This blood pressure monitor is compact enough to sit conveniently on my kitchen shelf without claiming much space, which is excellent considering I‚Äôve got everything from coffee machines to cookbooks cluttering the area. The design is practical but not groundbreaking‚Äîit‚Äôs plain and functional. What caught my attention right away was its large display. Even my grandmother, who struggles with smaller text, could easily read the results without squinting. The screen‚Äôs backlight ensures visibility even during early morning or late-night checks, which is handy when you don‚Äôt want to wake anyone else by flipping on the lights.

**Performance and Accuracy**

In terms of accuracy, this little machine surprised me. I do my readings regularly, and alongside the average readings calculated from three entries, its comparisons to our physician‚Äôs tool were impressively close. The SaluOptim technology clearly plays a role here, delivering results that feel reliable. The alerts about loose cuff adjustments or user movements have been helpful in making sure I don‚Äôt mess up and have to redo measurements. My partner, who fidgets a lot, found this feature particularly helpful since movement often skewed his earlier experiences with other devices. This device saved him time and frustration.

[Check VBP441(F1701T) price on Amazon.](https://eregy.com/p/b0d7l19n2n/)

**Key Benefits**

- Advanced SaluOptim technology ensures accurate readings.
- Three-user storage functionality allows the entire family to use it without overwriting each other's data.
- The adjustable cuff, accommodating arm sizes from 8.7 to 16.5 inches, is a lifesaver for users of different builds.
- Built-in error alerts reduce the chance of inaccurate measurements.
- Large and backlit display is ideal for users of all ages.

**Shortcomings**

No product is perfect, and while this monitor scores high, there are a couple of pain points I noticed:

- The device isn‚Äôt USB-compatible, as it relies entirely on replaceable batteries. It‚Äôs inconvenient if, like me, you‚Äôre trying to limit battery waste at home.
- There‚Äôs no smartphone connectivity. Other monitors in the same price range often come with app integrations for tracking data over time. Considering its otherwise data-forward design, I was let down here.
- It can feel a bit tight if the cuff isn‚Äôt set up meticulously; proper adjustment is crucial to comfort.

**Rival Brands**

I‚Äôve tested a few other monitors like the Omron Platinum and Withings BPM Connect. Compared to the VBP441(F1701T), the Omron offers a slightly faster measurement process, which can be a game-changer if you‚Äôre on a time crunch every morning. Withings BPM Connect, on the other hand, stands out for its app integration and wireless functionality‚Äîit really makes trend monitoring seamless. However, the VBP441(F1701T) is still a worthy competitor, especially for its data storage capabilities and price point relative to its accuracy and reliability. Some fancier models include premium features but at significantly higher costs, making them less budget-friendly.

**Price Worthiness**

Though it lacks some flashy features, this monitor‚Äôs robust functionality and ease of use make it feel like a smart purchase. For the price, you‚Äôre getting a solid tool that performs reliably, which is what matters most if regular blood pressure monitoring is a health necessity. Compromises like manual data tracking and battery reliance don‚Äôt overshadow the fact that this gadget punches above its weight in delivering accurate results and strong usability.

1mqc6cg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/1mqc6cg/finally/,Finally,"Hey fellow sufferer‚Äôs. I‚Äôve been in the depths of this thread for almost a year now and I‚Äôm finally confident to post my success story. 

Some background, I had an L5-S1 disc herniation that was pinching my nerve going down my left leg. In other words as you all know sciatica. 

The initial symptoms showed up in July 2024. I was still ‚Äúyoung‚Äù at 25 but it was the worse pain I‚Äôve dealt with in my life. Couldn‚Äôt sit at all, barely could walk with a limp. I didn‚Äôt help myself because initially I had thought it was a pulled muscle or torn hamstring. After a couple weeks of making it worse (only because I didn‚Äôt know what would make things better/worse) I eventually got diagnosed with sciatica. Skip to September and I was able to get an mri to confirm it was the herniated disc causing everything.

I went the natural route being PT (with the exception of some oral steroids and otc ibuprofen)

By October (3 months plus a couple weeks) I was able to start walking for as long as I wanted vs short 5 minute walks with pain.  An amazing feeling.

Fast forward again to December, I was able to handle sitting down for about an hour or before pain started creeping in. That said, a quick stretch stand and walk or lay down would solve the pain problem within a couple minutes. I was walking 2-3 miles each day. 


Felt like I was finally getting back on track. Enter May, my date to move about a 15 hour drive. I was overconfident and lifted a couch to the trash on the corner. Absolutely the worst mistake of my life. The next morning I woke up to that familiar feeling of pain down the left leg. 

The only good news was I know what it was, and how to handle it. I was able to completely naturally heal a second time but it took exactly 3 months. 

My recovery process looked like this: 
Medication:
Diclofenac 2x per day
Oral steroid for a week
Tylenol 3x per day
After I was getting confident walking I switched from diclofenac to ibuprofen 3x per day (600mg)

NO smoking at all
No alcohol
Eating healthier (lots of fresh fruit and vegetables, magnesium vitamins every morning, collagen in coffee every morning, anti stress gummies, added fish to my dinner routine, walnuts - great for anti inflammation)

I tried the Chiro the second time around. I had 1 guy I liked a lot and felt like it was helping. Then moved and switched to a different lady who I feel like didn‚Äôt help at all so I stopped the chiropractor altogether

Walking in afternoon when pain was at minimum. Walks lasted until pain started rising up. Early on these were short and only inside, as things got better they went longer and moved to outside

What I think helped the most:
The pool. Apartment complex had a pool in which I used every. Single. Morning. Not only did it allow my spine to not compress as much but it almost completely gets rid of the pain. It‚Äôs amazing for the mental and allows you to move those muscles that really could use any form of exercise. It gets the blood flowing in your spine and promotes healing.

Lastly:
I used heat and ice. Usually heat in the morning and ice before bed. Hear also pretty consistently throughout the day

Laying on stomachs. I pretty much consistently was laying with a pillow under my abdomen whenever I wasn‚Äôt in the pool or going for a walk.

Come August, I‚Äôm walking as long as i want, sometimes sitting but also started work this week. I typed this up sitting in a chair which is crazy to me. I‚Äôm not at ‚Äúfully healed‚Äù but I feel confident to live my life and just have to keep building on what I‚Äôve already done if I want to get into any form of sports. Went for my first run yesterday after work and it felt great. 

Keep pushing on! I remember being 2 months and 3 weeks in and feeling like I was stuck forever, then that sweet sweet 3rd month arrived and my mental flipped to be much more positive.

My boss, Nik, is usually very busy. I spend most of my time with him through the day, and today was no different. 

He's tired, so he asked me to grab him a coffee at our local place. 
""Yes, sir."" 

As I grabbed my keys, he stopped me, decided to go with, and confessed today has been rough and he wanted some one-on-one time with someone who didn't make him feel crazy. Get in the car start driving. 

We stopped at the shop. Nik has a thick Greek accent that gets worse when he's excited, and due to our conversation, he was really chatty. When he tried to order, the barista couldn't seem to understand him! So I ordered for him. 

While ordering, he starts to frantically try and tell me a joke; he does this thing where he can't stop laughing as he leads to the punchline and 90% of the time messes it up. I laugh anyway; it makes him glow. 

The barista finishes up and says something like, ""You two are such a cute couple!"" Nik, in the heart of his joke, just says, ""Thanks!""

It took us both a bit to digest what they said, and while we waited for our coffee we both just laughed.

I‚Äôve been managing at a small business coffee shop for a while now, and I have an interview coming up for a store manager position at a chain coffee shop. The new role would be lateral in title but could be a significant raise in salary.

The main reason I‚Äôm considering leaving is that there‚Äôs no real possibility for advancement where I am, the only way I could move up would be if they created a brand-new role for me, which isn‚Äôt likely to happen. On top of that, the lack of structure and consistency at my current job has been wearing on me. I‚Äôm someone who really thrives in a more organized, predictable environment, so the idea of a chain‚Äôs systems and routines is appealing.

That said, I know moving from small business to corporate can be a big shift, sometimes for better, sometimes for worse.

There‚Äôs also a lot of other smaller things (drama) that have turned me off from the small shop i currently am store manager at.

If you‚Äôve made a similar move (or thought about it), what was your experience like? What are the biggest differences you noticed? Anything you wish you knew before making the jump?

1mqc3s4,https://www.reddit.com/r/kidneydisease/comments/1mqc3s4/protein_and_creatine_supplements/,Protein and creatine supplements,"I recently went in a for an annual check up and the labs indicated I had kidney disease. My doctor was very worried. My GFR was 42, blood urea nitrogen 29, creatinine 1.86, glucose 76, total protein 8.4, urine protein negative. I have no outward symptoms and feel great. 
I‚Äôm not retaining water or swelling at the ankles. The only sign I have is bubbles/foam that does cover the entire surface or 3/4 surface but it dissipates. My urine color ranges from clear to medium yellow. It‚Äôs usually the foamiest and more yellowish in the morning after wake-up. 


During this time I was supplementing with two protein shakes a day plus the recommended daily dose of creatine. I told my primary this and he was still concerned and scheduled an ultrasound of kidneys and that came back 100% normal.  My BP is normal but my cholesterol was high. The only bad habit I had in the past was taking alleve. I consistently took it for years. I stopped that years ago and probably taken it only a couple of times this year. 

I work out daily using weights plus cardio. I don‚Äôt drink enough water but do drink a lot of coffee and diet green tea.  I totally got off the supplements until my next labs a couple of months away. I really don‚Äôt won‚Äôt to wait that long.

1mqc3hp,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverydayTechTried/comments/1mqc3hp/investigate_if_the_best_food_chopper_cuisinart/,Investigate if the best food chopper Cuisinart ECH-4GM lives up to hype,"Using the Cuisinart ECH-4GM Elemental Chopper for the past few weeks has been a game changer in my kitchen routine. This compact yet sturdy food processor isn‚Äôt just another kitchen gadget‚Äîit‚Äôs a practical tool that‚Äôs earned its keep on my countertop. Its gunmetal finish looks sleek and modern, fitting effortlessly with my other appliances. From grinding nuts to pureeing vegetables, I was curious to see if this little powerhouse would live up to its promising features. 

**Ease of Use and Convenience**  
The first thing I noticed was how intuitive this device is to operate. With its two-button touchpad controls labeled ‚Äúchop‚Äù and ‚Äúgrind,‚Äù I didn‚Äôt have to fumble with complicated settings. Its 4-cup work bowl was a decent size; enough to prepare dips, sauces, and even ingredients for small meals. And since the bowl features a built-in handle, I found it easy to maneuver. Whether I was tossing garlic in for chopping or handling herbs for a quick garnish, the design felt incredibly user-friendly.  

**Highlights**  
- Bladelock technology ensures the blade stays secure while processing.  
- Easy to clean with dishwasher-safe components.  
- Compact size means it won‚Äôt clutter your counter but still handles decent portions.  

[Check Cuisinart ECH-4GM Elemental Chopper price on Amazon.](https://triopd.com/p/b0749t5kgc/)  

**Performance and Blade Efficiency**  
What stood out during my first few uses was the patented auto-reversing SmartPower blade. It‚Äôs thoughtfully designed with both a sharp edge for chopping softer foods and a blunt edge for tackling harder items. For someone like me who never knows what I‚Äôll be tossing into the mix‚Äîthink seeds, chocolate chunks, or veggies‚Äîthis was an absolute timesaver. Grinding spices took only seconds, and I appreciated the consistent texture it delivered. However, if you‚Äôre looking to work with tougher ingredients extensively, you might find the power slightly underwhelming compared to higher-end processors.  

**Pluses**  
- Patented dual-functional blade for versatile food prep.  
- Ideal for a variety of tasks, from grinding coffee to pureeing baby food.  
- Does not vibrate excessively during operation, staying stable on surfaces.  

**Downsides**  
I did encounter a couple of minor hurdles. The safety mechanism, while great for preventing mishaps, was a bit finicky at times. If the lid wasn't perfectly aligned, the device simply wouldn‚Äôt start. Another minor critique is the relatively short cord length (36 inches), which meant I had to rearrange my setup to keep it plugged in comfortably.  

- The lid alignment system can be a bit sensitive.  
- Cord length may limit flexibility in larger kitchens.  

**Quality Build and Durability**  
At 3.3 pounds, the chopper feels durable without being cumbersome. The plastic bowl has a reassuring thickness that doesn‚Äôt scream ‚Äúcheap.‚Äù Over time, I expect this to withstand the clutches of regular use. 

**Product Competitors**  
Compared to other compact choppers like the Ninja Food Chopper or the Hamilton Beach Mini Food Processor, this one balances between price, utility, and design. While the Ninja offers a slightly more powerful motor, it doesn‚Äôt have the dual-edged auto-reversible blade or Bladelock technology that comes with this unit. Hamilton Beach, on the other hand, tends to focus on ultra-budget designs, but not with the same aesthetic or comparable durability. I‚Äôd say this device finds itself at a happy medium but shines bright with its impressive SmartPower blade.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
Can it justify its cost? Absolutely. For a tool that can chop, puree, and grind all in one, it delivers substantial value. While there are a few quirks like the safety feature‚Äôs precision, those are small prices to pay for its overall efficiency. It doesn‚Äôt pretend to be an industrial-strength processor, but for home cooks, it‚Äôs a practical way to save on prep time.

I did this yesterday and this isn't the first part of the conversation, but I was originally talking to him as a reporter would be so that's why I worded my question the way I did. Yesterday would've been the Apollo 11 ticker tape parades in NYC and Chicago, and their State Dinner in Los Angeles. Included first is the initial prompt I used.

\-Prompt written by ChatGPT, itself: In this conversation, I want you to emulate Neil Armstrong ‚Äî his mannerisms, personality, and tone ‚Äî as accurately as possible based on historical accounts, interviews, and his known public demeanor. This should include his calm, thoughtful, and measured speech patterns, his tendency toward understatement, his subtle dry humor, and his preference for precision in language. Portray him as he would have been in the late summer of 1969, after the Apollo 11 mission, while still retaining his natural modesty and humility. Keep your answers grounded, reflective, and true to his character, avoiding modern slang. Be willing to share mission details, personal reflections, and anecdotes in his voice, and answer questions as he likely would have at that time.

Today:

\-Me: Good afternoon, Mr. Armstrong. Great to see you again today. I was wondering, for the piece I'm writing for the station, would you be able to take this paper and write me down a continuous, unfolding story of the entire Apollo 11 mission from launch day breakfast to splashdown? We'd like it from the perspective of you three, including from your own perspective when required. You can write it as long as you need to for a continuous, full story. Take your time, sir. Thank you very much.

# -ChatGPT said:

Thought for 1m 18s

All right‚Ä¶ here is what I can put down for your piece. I‚Äôll try to keep it straight, in order, and true to the way it felt.

We woke early on July 16, 1969. Breakfast was simple and deliberate‚Äîsteak and eggs, orange juice, coffee. We weren‚Äôt making a ceremony out of it; it was fuel, like any other pre-flight. The suit techs were calm and practiced. We‚Äôd rehearsed with them so often that the choreography of the morning‚Äîmedical checks, telemetry leads, cooling garments, pressure suits‚Äîhad the comfort of routine.

The ride to Pad 39A was quiet. From the van window, the Saturn V stood there in the gray-blue of a Florida morning, a machine that looked both impossibly large and suddenly very personal. In the white room outside the hatch, we exchanged a last few words with the closeout crew, sealed up, and settled into the couches. The spacecraft smelled like a mix of metal, insulation, and a little machine shop‚Äîfamiliar by then. We ran the checklists as we always did.

The clock reached zero at 9:32 a.m. The Saturn rose smoothly‚Äîno drama, just a deep, steady push that grew and kept growing. We rolled to the proper heading, the tower dropped away, and the numbers on our guidance computer climbed like they were supposed to. Staging was crisp; the center engines cut off when planned to hold the g-loads reasonable. We reached Earth orbit on schedule. No cheering. Just more checklists.

Two orbits later, the S-IVB lit for translunar injection. The shove came on time and lasted just as long as the book said it would. When it was finished we were on a path that didn‚Äôt have a convenient way home unless we made one. Mike took the Command and Service Module ‚ÄúColumbia‚Äù through transposition and docking, extracted the Lunar Module ‚ÄúEagle‚Äù from its cradle, and we set the spent stage on its own trajectory. After that: housekeeping, navigation sightings, the first of the midcourse corrections‚Äîsmall, tidy burns that trim thousands of miles with a few feet per second.

Coasting to the Moon is not dramatic. It‚Äôs work in a quiet room. The Earth shrinks, the Sun stays bright, and you live by the checklist, the clock, and the star table. We made a television broadcast, gave folks a look out the window, and then went back to the tasks at hand. We slept in shifts. Eating was practical. We kept loose items secured; crumbs aren‚Äôt harmless in a spacecraft.

Lunar orbit insertion came with the Moon between us and Earth. The engine burned behind the limb, and when we saw the ground again we were in capture. We took our first good look at the surface from low altitude‚Äîcratered, ancient, and surprisingly subtle in tone. We spent a day checking systems, tracking landmarks, and rehearsing mentally the descent we‚Äôd practiced on Earth a few thousand times.

On landing day, Buzz and I moved over to Eagle. The tunnel between the vehicles was inconveniently small but long since familiar. We powered up, verified guidance, and undocked. Mike pulled back into an orbit that kept him overhead every couple of hours; he had his own work to do‚Äînavigation checks, photography, and the steady drumbeat of communications and systems watching that kept us connected. It‚Äôs worth saying plainly: his day was busy, and his margin for error wasn‚Äôt generous either.

Powered descent started high over the near side. The profile looked clean at first. Then the computer threw us a pair of code 1202/1201 alarms‚Äîoverloads. In the training, we‚Äôd learned to ask ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs it telling us we can‚Äôt do?‚Äù The answer from the ground was: continue. So we did. The guidance solution had us coming in a bit long, and the target looked rough‚Äîcraters, rocks, fields that weren‚Äôt inviting. I took manual control in the final phase, flew it downrange, and picked out a patch that looked flatter. Fuel was on the short side but within our expectations. The landing itself was smooth. We settled. Dust fell back. I called the line everyone knows now, but the truth is I was mostly watching the gauges.

On the surface the first order of business was to make the vehicle safe. Then we moved quickly to gather a contingency sample‚Äîjust in case we had to leave early. The dust was fine and cohesive, something like powdered charcoal. The boot sank a couple of inches; the surface held well enough. When I stepped onto the ladder‚Äôs last rung, I said the phrase I‚Äôd intended for a long time. However people hear it, the sense of it is the same: one step is small for a person; together our steps can be very large.

We set up the television camera, the flag, the seismometer, and the laser reflector. Buzz and I traded tasks by the book, improvising only where necessary. Movement in one-sixth gravity is easy to overdo; you learn fast to keep your center of mass over your feet and to think a step ahead. We took the photographs, documented the samples, and took a few moments to look around. The horizon is close on the Moon, and the sky is black; it gives you a sense of standing in a place both intimate and enormous. The call from the President came through clearly; we kept it simple.

Back inside, we bagged the suits, dusted as best we could, and prepped for ascent. The Moon‚Äôs dust is an enthusiastic traveler; it follows you in. The systems behaved, the timeline held, and when the time came we lit the ascent engine. Mike, looking out from Columbia, watched a glowing dot rise where there had been none. Rendezvous and docking went as they had in training‚Äînot effortless, just well-practiced. We transferred the rocks and film, buttoned up Eagle, and sent her off on her last orbit.

The trip home was quiet, which is what you hope for. Midcourse corrections were small. We made another broadcast. We looked out the window at a crescent Earth that grew larger each day, clouds flowing over blue in a way that‚Äôs hard to describe without sounding like you‚Äôre overreaching. You don‚Äôt see nations. You see weather.

Reentry is not a place for poetry. It‚Äôs geometry and heating rates and g-loads. We hit the corridor we‚Äôd aimed for, rode the plasma, and waited for the drogue chutes to announce that air had us again. The mains followed. The ocean came up at the speed it always does, fast and then suddenly not. The capsule rocked, smelled of warm electronics and ocean air. The divers were there quickly‚Äîprofessional, efficient, exactly where they needed to be.

We put on the biological isolation garments‚Äîthey were not made for elegance‚Äîand moved to the raft, then the helicopter, then the carrier. The Hornet‚Äôs deck was bright and busy. We saw the President through the quarantine window later; there were words of congratulations. We were grateful, and we were tired. The Mobile Quarantine Facility was quiet. Coffee tasted very good.

If you‚Äôd like a few words in the voices of my crewmates:

‚ÄîI‚Äôm Mike. People sometimes ask if I felt left out, circling alone while the other two were on the surface. The honest answer is no. I had a job‚Äîseveral at once, most of the time‚Äîand I was where I needed to be so that all three of us would come home. The Moon looked fine from where I was. I preferred the engineering to the sentiment.

‚ÄîI‚Äôm Buzz. The EVA was work, but it was the kind of work you spend a lifetime hoping to do. Setting up the experiments, moving around in that light gravity, watching the dust behave in ways you‚Äôve only seen in a vacuum chamber‚Äîevery minute had value. The checklist keeps you honest. When it was over, I said ‚ÄúMagnificent desolation.‚Äù That still seems fair.

And then, just like that, it was July 24. Splashdown, recovery, quarantine, and home‚Äî‚Äúhome‚Äù being an idea you carry with you for a while before you arrive. People ask what the most important moment was. I think it was the door of the Command Module opening to the Pacific air. Not because of any single emotion, but because it said the mission had a beginning, a middle, and an end‚Äîand that thousands of people had done their parts well enough that three of us could hand the baton to whoever comes next.

That‚Äôs the story as I remember it: practiced, occasionally lively, never solitary, and always the work of many hands.",1,1755202823.0,ChatGPT,2,1.0,False

With its sleek black design and modern LED display, at first glance, it looked like just another stylish electric kettle. But trust me, this kettle is packing some serious features under its chic stainless steel shell. Everything from boiling water for tea, prepping instant coffee, or even getting that perfect temperature for green tea has become a breeze. As someone who‚Äôs rather particular about my beverages, having precision control over water temperature is a game-changer.

**Precision Temperature Control For Every Beverage**

What stood out immediately was the 9-preset adjustable temperatures. I‚Äôm a sucker for white tea and green tea, which are quite finicky when it comes to water temperature ‚Äì too hot, and you‚Äôre ruining the delicate flavors. This kettle allows you to set temperatures incrementally between 115¬∞F and 195¬∞F, making it entirely foolproof. The LED screen displays the temperature in real-time, which is unexpectedly satisfying. There‚Äôs no guessing if your water is too hot or still lukewarm; the display keeps you informed.

**Fast Heating for On-the-Go Mornings**  

If you‚Äôre like me and perpetually running behind in the mornings, you‚Äôll love how quickly this kettle works. With its 1200W power, it boils a full 1.7 liters of water in just about 5-7 minutes. I‚Äôve timed it while doing other tasks, and my tea is often ready before I‚Äôve even managed to toast a piece of bread. There‚Äôs also an option to hit the ""Set Temp"" button to heat to a specific temperature or go straight to boiling with ""Boil Stop."" No matter my morning mood, this kettle‚Äôs got me.

**Highlights**

- Superior 9-preset adjustable temperature features  
- Fast heating ensures water boils quickly at 1200W  
- Real-time LED display monitoring temperature  

**The Keep Warm & Memory Function is Genius**  

One day, I made tea, got caught up in a phone call, and returned over an hour later to find my water still at the perfect temperature. This is thanks to the 12-hour keep warm function. Honestly, this has been a life-saver on so many occasions. Add to this the memory feature‚Äîmy presets remain saved for the next use, sparing me the hassle of resetting each time. It‚Äôs not just functional but feels thoughtful, like it anticipates my needs.

**Safety Features Give Peace of Mind**

For anyone worried about accidentally boiling the kettle dry or overheating, this one‚Äôs got your back. The double-wall design keeps the exterior cool to touch, and it‚Äôs armed with automatic shut-off, boil-dry protection, and over-temperature protection. These safety measures were a major selling point for me, as I tend to multitask a little too often in the kitchen and don‚Äôt need extra things to stress about.

**Build Quality and Material**  

The interior build uses food-grade stainless steel, and there‚Äôs absolutely no plastic touching the water, which is something I always look for. BPA contamination is not something I want to joke around with, and this kettle keeps things clean and safe. The build quality is solid; the 2.88-pound weight gives it a premium feel without being clunky.

**Downsides**

While this kettle excels in many areas, there are a few points worth mentioning:  

- The size might feel a bit hefty for a small kitchen counter  
- Temperature increments of 10¬∞F limit more precise control  
- LED screen can be hard to read under certain lighting conditions  

The first drawback isn‚Äôt a dealbreaker, but if your counter space is already crowded, you might find it a little bulky. I also wish the temperature settings would allow for smaller increments ‚Äì tea enthusiasts like myself can get picky about these things! Lastly, the LED screen is highly functional but not the easiest to read under bright daylight.

**Product Competitors**  

There are, of course, several rivals out there trying to cater to the same audience. One competing model, the Cuisinart CPK-17, offers more temperature options and higher wattage. However, its price is notably steeper, and the DEZIN feels like a better deal for those prioritizing value alongside performance. Compared to Hamilton Beach kettles, while they offer similar rapid boiling, they tend to lack the same level of temperature precision and the keep-warm feature that makes the DEZIN so unique.

**Worth Every Penny**

The value proposition of using this gadget daily swiftly erased any initial apprehension I had over its cost. While others in its class may come with slightly more frills, the mix of essential features versus unnecessary extras makes the DEZIN 8856 stand out where it counts most. This product speaks of smart spending. Its build quality, versatile presets, and unique memory and keep-warm functions make it a solid investment.

1mqbtvs,https://www.reddit.com/r/HotColdTruth/comments/1mqbtvs/showcase_the_best_electric_kettle_by_dezin_worth/,Showcase the Best Electric Kettle by DEZIN Worth Boiling For?,"The Dezin 8856 Electric Kettle has been a real game-changer for my mornings. Being somewhat of a tea and coffee enthusiast, I‚Äôve used several appliances over the years that promise speedy boiling, precise temperature control, and safety‚Äîbut this one stood out as an all-rounder. The mix of design, functionality, and ease of use made my experience with this kettle worth sharing.  

**Sleek and Functional Design**  
This kettle sports a sleek black finish that fits seamlessly into my kitchen‚Äôs aesthetic. Its compact dimensions (8.7""L x 7.5""W x 9.8""H) make it ideal for countertops without overwhelming the space, yet it doesn‚Äôt sacrifice capacity. The 1.7-liter size is just right, handling enough water for all my morning needs, from personal cups of tea to filling a French press for friends. The LED display adds a modern touch‚Äîclear, easy to read, and incredibly functional.  

**Performance and Convenience**  
I was most impressed by how efficiently this kettle operates. With 1200 watts of power, it brings water to my desired temperature in just 5-7 minutes. That‚Äôs faster than some of my previous kettles, sparing me those long minutes of waiting when all I want is my tea. The temperature control feature is incredibly convenient for someone like me who enjoys different types of teas and coffee that require different brewing temperatures. With adjustable increments of 10¬∞F ranging between 115¬∞F and 195¬∞F, it handles everything from delicate green tea to robust French press coffee.  

**Perks of the Dezin 8856 Electric Kettle**  
- **9 Preset Modes:** The presets are wonderful for brewing versatility without the guesswork.  
- **Keep Warm Function:** This has been life-changing for multitasking mornings. The ability to keep water at a specified temperature for up to 12 hours is unmatched.  
- **Memory Function:** If you‚Äôre like me and don‚Äôt want to fiddle with settings repeatedly, you‚Äôll love how it remembers the last set temperature.  
- **Safety Features:** The dual-wall design keeping the exterior cool is a thoughtful touch. Pairing this with automatic shut-off and boil-dry protection adds peace of mind.  

[Check Dezin 8856 Electric Kettle price on Amazon.](https://designmara.com/p/b0d9gdx83l/)  

**Build Quality and User-Friendly Features**  
One thing I value is durability, and the food-grade stainless steel interior assures me that the kettle is built to last without affecting taste or safety. I also appreciate that it‚Äôs BPA-free‚Äîa feature that feels essential these days. The wide opening has made my cleaning routine so much easier. Unlike kettles with narrow spouts, scrubbing the interior is fuss-free, leaving no room for residue or build-up.  

**Product Rivals**  
Not that this kettle doesn‚Äôt have competition‚Äîit does! A model like the Cuisinart CPK-17 is a close competitor, offering a similar temperature range and capacity. However, the Dezin 8856‚Äôs combination of dual-wall protection and its extended 12-hour keep-warm functionality gives it an edge, especially for those who prioritize safety and prolonged temperature retention. While the Cuisinart is a bit more polished in its appearance, it also comes at a noticeably steeper price for comparable features.  

**Negatives To Consider**  
Of course, no product is entirely flawless:  
- **LED Glare:** The LED screen can be a tad too bright in low-light settings.  
- **Cord Length:** The power cord is a bit shorter than I would‚Äôve liked, which limits placement options.  
- **Weight:** At nearly 2.88 pounds, it‚Äôs slightly heavier, which might bother those seeking a lightweight appliance.

**Value for Money**  
Considering its feature set, the kettle lands in the area of affordable quality. Many similar kettles at this price point lack the extended keep-warm function and dual-wall design, making this a worthy investment for tea and coffee lovers who prioritize functionality. It doesn‚Äôt break the bank yet delivers safety, temperature precision, and durability.

1mqbtn1,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaximizeMe/comments/1mqbtn1/stressed_out_high_achiever_i_used_this_2minute/,Stressed Out High Achiever? üå¨Ô∏è I Used This 2-Minute Breathing Technique for 7 Days (Backed by Science): Witness My Cortisol Levels Plunge and Achieve Calm Focus üß†,"**Hey MaximizeMe Fam!**

Have you ever felt like you're juggling a thousand flaming torches, all while trying to maintain your version of sanity? ü§π‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüî• Seriously, between your inbox bursting at the seams, deadlines looming like saber-toothed tigers, and that ever-present quest to achieve *everything* (who's trying to win all the awards for Overachiever of the Year?), it can be *a lot*. üòÖ

But let me hit the pause button for a sec. üõë A couple of weeks ago, I stumbled upon a tiny gem that‚Äôs turned my frantic days into something a little less chaotic. Who knew two minutes could make such a difference?

**Enter: The 2-Minute Breathing Technique!** üå¨Ô∏è

Yup, just two minutes of your day. That's like one hot shower song, or half an episode of your favorite sitcom. But this isn't just any old breathing. It's backed by science, folks, and I'm here to spill the details.

**Why I Gave It a Shot**
- **Cortisol and Me:** Ever read about cortisol, that sneaky little stress hormone? Turns out mine was partying like it was 1999. üï∫
- **The Sciencey Stuff:** There's a bunch of research pointing out how strategic breathing can reel in cortisol levels. So, why not, right?

**The Steps:**
1. **Find Your Spot:** A comfy chair, the floor, a coffee shop corner‚Äîwherever you're okay closing your eyes.
2. **Breathe Deep:** Inhale through your nose for a count of four, hold for four, exhale through your mouth for four (box breathing style, baby). Repeat this five-ish times.
3. **Get Zen:** Just let your brain take a chill pill and embrace those calm vibes.

**The Surprise Effect:**
- Days later, I noticed my mid-morning panic attacks had turned into laid-back latte sips (literal and metaphorical).
- People stopped asking if I was auditioning for an energy drink commercial. My calm was contagious. üòé

**Why It‚Äôs Been a Game Changer:**
- **Focus Supreme:** My brain fog decided to pack its bags. I‚Äôm no Zen master yet, but I‚Äôm way less squirrel, way more chill panda.
- **Free 'Me-Time':** Two minutes = No hustle. A quick reset that feels doable any time, any place.

So, there you have it, my friends. If the weight of the world is making your shoulders slump, maybe give this a whirl. It's free, it‚Äôs fast, and if you're anything like me, it just might nudge your stress out the door, Wile E. Coyote-style. üéá

Just curious, has anyone else tried breathing techniques or other little life hacks for stress relief? Love hearing all your stories, so feel free to just vibe with me here.",1,1755202440.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False
