I recently joined r/loseit and noticed that many people posting on here seem to be struggling with losing weight and the best way to do so. So I thought I would share my own experience with weight loss and how I went from 215lbs down to 150lbs. Hopefully anyone reading this can hopefully take something positive from it to help them on their weight loss journey.

If your only goal is weight loss and you are not concerned about losing any muscle then this is a good plan to follow.

**Calories**

The first thing you should do when looking to lose weight is figure out what your kcal daily requirements are. Eat less than this so you know how many calories you need per day to lose weight. I recommend using this website to figure it out.

https://www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html

Find out what your daily maintenance calories are, minus 500 calories from that number so roughly 1500 calories a day. Eat this number a day. Add in cardio which eventually should get to a point when you are burning around 3500 calories a week. 6 cardio sessions a week. Sounds pretty extreme but it‚Äôs around 600 calories per cardio session. It‚Äôs not that extreme a number. It‚Äôs just about building up your fitness to be able to do it consistently over a prolong period of time.

**Diet**

I would recommend a 90/10 split for your diet. As in 90% of your daily diet should be clean calories and around 10% can be junk food. I feel this is the best approach, especially those who struggle with eating clean. The majority of your calories should come from fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Some dairy is ok. What fruit and veg you decide is up to you. Just go for the lowest calorie options generally. Some fruits can be quite high in calories. Watch out for those. Calories in vs calories out is the most important thing. It‚Äôs very important you cut out processed food out your diet.

**Intermittent Fasting**

First thing in the morning have only black coffee. Have a few cups if you like. You will need the caffeine for your cardio sessions. It basically has no calories. Do your cardio. After your cardio I recommend decaf coffee. It helps curb your appetite. I also recommend intermittent fasting. 16/8. 16 hour fast. 8 hours eating period. It might sound difficult but it‚Äôs really not. Your body will adapt. I can now go around 8-10 hours after waking up before I start feeling hungry. Start the fast after your last meal at night. Go sleep. By the time you wake up it should be around 8-9 hours already passed by. Have your coffee then cardio in the gym. By then you should probably have another few hours to go. Just drink lots of water and have some coffee/decaf coffee. Basically any low calorie drink. Even diet soda since it has no calories. The weight will begin flying off.

**Cardio**

I already touched on cardio earlier but will go into more detail now. Cardio is really important for weight loss. If your only goal is weight loss and not concerned about losing muscle then just stick to cardio. Lifting weights isn‚Äôt necessary. Build up your fitness levels. Start off with long slower cardio sessions eventually it should get to a point when it‚Äôs a mixture of liss and hiit cardio as each type of cardio offers different benefits. After each cardio session your shirt should be drenched in sweat once your fitness levels allow it. Challenge yourself with each cardio session. Don‚Äôt slack off. Listen to your body however. If you feel you need a break take it. Don‚Äôt risk overtraining.

Hopefully there is enough information here to get you started or increase your knowledge of weight loss and given you new ideas. The point I was trying to make here is that weight loss is super simple. Its really about finding the motivation to stick to a diet/training plan long term because it can be difficult. In a months time of following this advice you should definitely start noticing a difference in your body.

1hkc4jl,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpiceGirls/comments/1hkc4jl/forever_era/,Forever Era ,"It‚Äôs no secret the Forever album plummeted and led to their hiatus. However what was most shocking to me looking back is how lazy the promotion was especially in the USA (where I‚Äôm from). 

The album debuted and peaked at #38 before completely falling out of the charts even before Christmas. 

To this day it doesn‚Äôt even have a gold certification (500k in album sales for USA). It‚Äôs shifted 275k-300k. America had to literally ship back copies to UK Virgin records it was that underwhelming. Their greatest hits album sold more and is platinum in this country. None of the girls solo careers ever took off in America. Geri‚Äôs debut album did become certified platinum (1 million in album sales). However that was a slow burn. That‚Äôs the only solo Spice album or single to be certified anything in America. Not even Mel C‚Äôs single with Left-Eye made an impression on the US charts and TLC was selling out arenas and all over the charts. 

What they should‚Äôve done, is broadcast the Christmas in Spice World Tour on broadcast TV. It was broadcasted in multiple Countries but not the US. By this point the Spice Girls still had some steam left in America. Goodbye did peak at #11 the year before which was a higher peak than Spice Up Your Life, Stop, or Viva Forever. However ‚ÄúTour Story: Spice Girls in America‚Äù wasn‚Äôt even released in America. 

They should‚Äôve broadcasted the Christmas tour in America, released that documentary that is about their time in America, in actual America on VHS, released the Forever Spice coffee table book in America, and have done something other than release a couple more doll lines in ‚Äò99 in America. 

They still had momentum in December of ‚Äò99. But by that point, Britney and Christina were dominating the ‚Äúgirl pop‚Äù charts. According to reports they were shocked about how badly Forever bombed in America which aside from other parts of Europe, America was their biggest export. ",1,1734914742.0,SpiceGirls,0,1.0,False

- The director of that coffee shoot was a DICK and so rude to these girls

- Looking back, this season is really hard to predict when it starts and goes for a while  IMO

he compares the cs skins scene to japan's gambling loopholes with pachinko. ArrowCS also lightly explains the Steam Deck resell tech. He also insinuates that the X-Ray case method in France will eventually come back to bite Valve.

the entire video is basically just coffee saying, ""corporation greedy"" and that they arent doing enough, which is true to be fair but unfortunately not exactly breaking news.

 I am currently in love with a girl that have become my best friend over the course of our two last year's in school, now we are both university students(different universities, same city). 
 
When I was in 10th grade my class got basically disbanded and the ones that remained in the school got sorted out in other classes. I always had a lot of women friends in school(and no male friends lol) so I casually befriended almost all the girls in the new class, but something about talking to her was special. The time she asked for my Instagram asking for economics homework I couldn't stop smiling all day, even If it was just a study-related thing. 
 
Since that day we began talking a lot more, we have a similar sense of humor, had a lot to talk about and all that. Honestly, I would've asked her out right there, but there was one complication, I had a girlfriend, so obviously at that time I didn't even thought about her that way.
 
Time goes by, we become even more closer as we are getting ready for our finals in school which determined what university we'd be going. Both of us are pretty hard on studying, so yeah, in school we were almost always helping each other with our studies, I was the math guy, and she knew everything about history. 
 
In the second semester we had to choose partners for the waltz on our graduation day. At that point almost everyone in the class chose their partners(or lack off in some cases), but I kept postponing the day I ask her out, which was not common for me to struggle so much. Finally I text her asking if she wants to dance with me, she was surprised I actually asked and said she needed some time to consider it. After three long hours of me biting my nails and kicking my pillow she agreed.
 
Exam day came by, and both of us scored max in at least one subject, so our school mentioned our duo as a honorable mention on grad day, and we danced together.
And I know this sounds crazy but even at that point I was still in denial of my feelings. 
 
The realization hit me when we went on our graduation trip with class. A bunch of teens in a hotel in mountains with a few mothers(that swore they'd keep everything that happened there a secret from our parents, unless it's troubling our health), what can go wrong. We'll nothing really, we obviously got drunk, and there were a few cute moments when she wore my hoodie because it became cold outside, we gathered to try to dance our waltz while drunk(it was two months since graduation and everyone failed miserably), I disappeared to walk around our hotel alone and apparently everyone kept asking her where I was at like she was responsible for me, and then at night when everyone fell asleep, she texted me and we got up at 5am to get even more drunk and meet the sunrise.
 
At that point my feelings for her were obvious as fuck, but a sudden doubt kicked in, ""What if she only wanted to see me as her friend?"", I mean I know I don't but what if I ruin everything?
 
Right now we don't meet up much, first year of uni was wild for both of us and we only texted once every week or so, but every time we do both of us still reply almost immediately and we can talk for a few hours.
 
So I gathered up my thoughts and invited her to a coffee shop(her favorite thing) at Christmas Eve, she accepted.

Starting a salon business at home can be a fulfilling venture. With the right planning, tools, and dedication, you can transform your passion for hairdressing into a thriving enterprise. Here‚Äôs a detailed guide to help you navigate through the essential steps to get your salon business off the ground.

### Understand Your Market

Before you begin, it's crucial to understand the hairdressing market in your area. Research what services are in demand, who your competitors are, and what prices they charge. Look into what clients are saying about existing salons. This insight will help you tailor your services to meet the needs of your future clients.

### Set Your Business Goals

Define your vision and objectives. Ask yourself important questions:

By establishing clear goals, you'll have a roadmap that guides your decisions and actions.

This plan not only helps clarify your vision but can also be indispensable if you seek loans or investments.

### Get Licensed and Insured

Before you start cutting hair, make sure you fulfill legal obligations. Obtain the necessary licenses, which typically include a cosmetology license and a business license.

- **Booking System:** Implement an easy online booking feature to streamline appointments, making it convenient for clients to schedule their visits.
- **Portfolio Section:** Include a gallery of your work to showcase your talents and attract more clients.

Personal branding plays a significant role in differentiating your home salon from competitors. Consider developing a unique brand identity that resonates with your target audience. Here are some ideas:

### Essential Hairdressing Tools

When it comes to hairdressing, certain tools are non-negotiable. Here are the must-have items to keep in your arsenal:

Once the cut is complete, styling tools come into play:

### Salon Furniture

Creating a comfortable space is just as important as having the right tools. Consider these pieces of furniture:

- **Salon Chair:** A comfortable and adjustable chair is crucial for both client comfort and ease of access during haircuts.
- **Styling Station:** This can be a dedicated cart or a table where you keep all of your regularly used tools and products organized.
- **Mirror:** Ensure a large, high-quality mirror is available for clients to see their transformations.
- **Shampoo Bowl:** If you‚Äôre offering hair washing, a shampoo bowl with an adjustable neck usually makes for a better experience.

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
### Design and Layout

The first thing a client notices when they enter your home salon is the layout and design. A well-organized space can make a significant difference. Here are some tips to consider:

- **Open Space:** Aim for a layout that feels open and uncluttered. Avoid overcrowding with furniture or equipment. A spacious feel will make clients feel at ease.
- **Functional Zones:** Divide your salon into distinct areas such as reception, styling, and waiting areas. This separation helps clients understand where they need to be and creates a more professional appearance.
- **Incorporate Natural Light:** Utilize windows and mirrors to maximize natural light. A bright space feels more inviting and can improve the overall energy of the environment.

### Color Scheme and Decor

The colors you choose for your home salon can significantly impact the mood and atmosphere. Consider the following aspects:

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
- **Choose Soothing Colors:** Soft colors like pastels or earthy tones can create a calm environment. Avoid overly bright colors that might clash or create a chaotic vibe.
- **Personal Touch:** Decorate your salon with personal touches such as artwork, plants, or photography. This makes the space feel more like your own and can help clients connect with you on a personal level.
- **Functional Decor:** Use decor items that serve a purpose, like stylish storage solutions or towel racks. This combination of beauty and functionality keeps the space looking neat.

### Comfort for Clients

Clients should feel comfortable during their visit. Here are ideas to enhance their comfort:

- **Seating:** Invest in quality seating in the waiting area and styling chairs. Comfortable chairs can make a significant difference in how clients perceive their experience.
- **Beverages:** Offer complimentary drinks such as water, tea, or coffee. A simple refreshment can make clients feel welcome and pampered.
- **Magazines and Entertainment:** Keep a selection of current magazines or set up a digital screen with entertainment options. This helps pass the time while clients wait.

### Friendly Greeting

The way you greet clients sets the tone for their experience. Make sure to:

- **Be Warm and Inviting:** Greet each client with a smile and a friendly welcome. A genuine approach can ease their nerves and create an immediate connection.

Each of these strategies plays a crucial role in curating an inviting ambiance for your home salon. By focusing on comfort, aesthetic appeal, and genuine interactions, you can create an experience that keeps clients coming back. Remember, a welcoming atmosphere is not just about the physical space; it's about building relationships and ensuring clients feel special during their visit.

Navigating Legal and Financial Aspects of Running a Home-Based Salon
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Starting a salon business from your home can be an exciting venture, but it comes with its own set of challenges, particularly in the legal and financial areas. Understanding these aspects is crucial for your success and helps avoid potential pitfalls. Below are essential points to consider as you navigate this rewarding journey.

### Legal Requirements

Before you open your doors to clients, ensure you have all the necessary legalities checked off. This will protect your business and give your clients confidence in your services. Here are the key legal steps you should follow:

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
- **Business License:** Verify if you need a state or local license to operate a salon from home. This often requires an application process, so check with your local government.
- **Tax Identification Number:** Register for a tax ID with the IRS. This is important for any business, as you'll need it for tax purposes.
- **Insurance:** Protect yourself from potential liabilities by obtaining the right insurance. General liability insurance, along with professional liability insurance, can safeguard against claims arising from your services.
- **Health and Safety Regulations:** Comply with local health department regulations. This may include sanitation practices and maintaining clean workspaces, which are vital in the beauty industry.

### Financial Planning

Once you're legally set up, understanding the financial side of your home salon is just as important.

#### Start-Up Costs

Your initial investment may vary based on your offerings, but typical expenses include:

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
- **Home Office Deduction:** If you use a portion of your home solely for your salon, see if you qualify for this.

### Client Management

Offer excellent customer service and build relationships. Client referrals can be your best marketing strategy. Using scheduling software can help you manage appointments efficiently, making sure you never double-book or miss clients.

By keeping these legal and financial aspects in check, you lay a solid foundation for your home salon business. You not only protect yourself legally and financially but also enhance client satisfaction. This will ultimately lead to a successful and sustainable salon right from the comfort of your home.

1hkbr1k,https://www.reddit.com/r/INTJ_/comments/1hkbr1k/the_negative_side_of_intj/,The Negative Side of INTJ,"I was going to post the negative profile in a few hours, but this got to be too long, and yet, I have 60% of it gutted to be written into a paper of insights. 

https://preview.redd.it/xbokzs3ych8e1.png?width=841&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ef42026a04436b7bbff53e5f367f7c8e93e0400

I built this prompt to tear apart and dissemble information and stack them all up and consolidate them, linking the behaviors to a consensus, weighing them by severity and likelihood given the traits. The INTJ profile overwhelmingly comes with something I had initially hypothesized through the areas of the brain the INTJ uses most.

I haven‚Äôt always associated higher anxiety with higher intelligence. It was only this past year, as I noticed how many reckless people I knew had died from their reckless behavior, that I began to make the connection. I reflected and asked myself: what keeps me alive? I engage in far more dangerous activities, but my risks don‚Äôt involve drinking and driving, fighting an animal, or doing something similarly foolish. Accidents happen, and when you lose control, that‚Äôs when things go wrong. These are the situations I avoid. Those who lack hesitation often fall victim to natural selection. Reflecting further, this made sense from an evolutionary perspective.

My risks are extremely calculated. I‚Äôm never surprised when I hear news of someone dying or something terrible happening because I‚Äôm always anticipating the absolute worst-case scenario. And that‚Äôs fine‚Äîit prepares me. Meanwhile, an ESFP avoids thinking about such things, distracting themselves outwardly. This contrast wasn‚Äôt meant to align with my MBTI framework, but it fits all too well and might even correct one or two fundamentally mistyped personalities that stem from minimal bad data.

There is too much that I can write here. I will write papers on this in the future at this collection:

**Red Flag:** Neglect of emotional needs for strategic priorities.

**Likely Disorders:**

1. Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)
2. Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD)

I cannot say that these are definitive, but they reached almost a consensus with one of my previous scores. Evaluation was performed by o1 analysis, and from Gemini 1.5-Pro Researcher. Averaged with my findings

[\<\> is from habit forming activities or natural chemical cycles.](https://preview.redd.it/mag2syhabh8e1.png?width=1343&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6502bdd3f4cd68be7238b528896b64c2b054f5f)

ESFP and INTJ both experience concern, but the realization of Anxiety vs. Stress reveals a fundamental distinction. The narrative shifted upon recognizing this difference: anxiety predominates rather than stress. While both states can optimize learning, memory, and data processing, their key differences significantly affect outcomes. So, what distinguishes stress from anxiety?

Reducing anxiety may lower glutamate levels, particularly in brain regions like the hippocampus, which plays a role in emotional regulation. Acetylcholine, crucial for learning, thrives in such conditions. In contrast, stress significantly increases glutamate levels, enhancing alertness and cognitive performance. Moderate exercise, known to elevate glutamate levels, supports cognitive function and neuroplasticity‚Äîmeaning the conflation with exercise is just a ploy to get us to go outside. Nice try, Big Gass!

Exercise increases GABA levels, which promotes relaxation and reduces anxiety, however, it is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, GABA counterbalances glutamate's excitatory effects. Another clever tactic nicely executed once more.

**Dietary Contributions:**

* **Tyrosine**: An amino acid present in protein-rich foods such as meat, fish, and dairy. As a precursor to dopamine, consuming sufficient tyrosine supports dopamine production.
* **Tryptophan**: Found in foods like turkey, eggs, and nuts, this amino acid acts as a precursor to serotonin. Consuming tryptophan-rich foods can enhance serotonin synthesis.
* **Norepinephrine**: Increased levels of this neurotransmitter boost alertness, focus, and cognitive performance. However, chronic stress may dysregulate norepinephrine, contributing to anxiety and mood disorders.
* **Choline**: A nutrient available in eggs, liver, and soybeans, choline is essential for acetylcholine production. Acetylcholine is pivotal for learning and memory, aiding in both the formation of new memories and the retrieval of existing ones.

While the distinctions between neurotransmitter dynamics remain somewhat elusive, these dietary and lifestyle factors provide actionable insights for enhancing cognitive and emotional well-being.

**Neurodegenerative properties can emerge from both excessive increases and decreases in neurotransmitter levels.** Dopamine, while not directly repairing the brain, plays a role in facilitating other parts of the brain that promote activation and production causing neural repair by supporting processes that enhance overall brain health. **This observation is supported by studies analyzed over years of back-burner research, as opposed to auxiliary research, and primary research.**

**I spend my days learning, and do not watch television, or really anything people would find entertaining.**

# Even in my most depressed state, I am learning.

**Here is something I made in a depressive bout during a very bad episode of depression to try and convey the feeling.**

[This was before MBTI, and I found INTJ to be at the Hyper Conscious Level more than any other type, while P types like to hang in the LUD to LLC level shifting between that and GC.](https://preview.redd.it/eypo4wybqh8e1.png?width=553&format=png&auto=webp&s=df3bf344f7b0f0aa016166c40f5cd61cb0874127)

**Prepare for an Unpopular Opinion:**

**Note:** Not a medical doctor. Always talk with your doctor on what is best for you. 

**Attention: a Warning.**

**SUoP:** I personally believe that **Coca-Cola and the other corporations** should allow the U.S. Government to allow them to reintroduce coke in a controlled and regulated manner‚Äîpersonally, I think coffee is awful to the mind and body. ***Yeah, moreso than controlled substances. But hey, the U.S. has had our best interests at hand. Always has.*** 

This idea however, is the focus of a future paper I need to complete that **is currently 52,000 words long,** which ultimately deals with the development of human consciousness over the history of our species going into the wild misconceptions of today.

Including coke in a legal and controlled framework‚Äîregulated to prevent misuse‚Äîcould stop it from being converted into crack or overused. By integrating syrups that make it difficult to distill or separate into more substances, attempts to do so would likely fail.

**What if a child gets into it?** First, the amount would be minimal. Second, if you knowingly give your child coffee and base your opinion solely on selectively biased papers against it, that responsibility is on you. That said, I still enjoy the taste of coffee‚Äîit‚Äôs not too bad if consumed in moderation, like everything else.

Essentially, my point is that coffee isn‚Äôt inherently bad for you, but neither are coke or amphetamines when used in low, controlled doses. That being said, this is America‚Äîyou should have the freedom to make your own choices. After all, we allow highly carcinogenic substances in our food, and people protest when companies try to remove them, like with General Mills.

The truth is, you‚Äôre likely to die from something else long before your heart or brain gives out. Meanwhile, these food dyes, **which no one seems to discuss, cause significant cardiovascular stress and damage.** I‚Äôve experienced severe panic attacks before‚Äîsome mimicking heart attacks. Once I stopped consuming food and drinks with dyes, the attacks stopped.

Recently, I ate a few fruit-colored chewy candies without realizing they contained dyes, and suddenly I was sweating, my heart was racing, and I felt that familiar sense of unease. When I checked the label, it had every artificial color listed‚ÄîI hadn‚Äôt noticed because I was just grabbing without thinking.

This approach is not a ""may"" but would reduce drug and cartel-related violence, including border issues that Republicans often criticize. In fact, it aligns with many narratives the Democratic Party priorities as well. The fact that this solution hasn‚Äôt been considered or implemented highlights society's incompetence. 

People often claim, *""It's more complex than that,""* but it really isn't. If misuse leads to fatalities, that's natural selection. Personally, I take Adderall, and my heart is fine‚Äîbut over the last few years that I have drank coffee, my heart was pounding for hours. This happens occasionally during a three-day relaxation period I schedule every two weeks to stabilize my mood and support my mental health (you know, mitigating the feeling of addiction with another, but I stress that these periods of abstinent are detrimental to overall wellbeing. **However, read the warning, not a doctor**.

I take Adderall to manage ADHD and help balance my bipolar disorder. Many don‚Äôt fully understand how neural pathways work, but for me, Adderall‚Äîused alongside inhibitors like Risperidone‚Äîkeeps certain pathways from becoming overexcited (an issue in bipolar disorder which causes overuse and shut down). This balance allows the underperforming pathways affected by ADHD to function properly. ADHD isn't strictly about dopamine deficiency; it's about specific neural pathways being affected similarly to bipolar, but in fundamentally different ways. This balance prevents overactivation that leads to wear and burnout, while avoiding underperformance that could cause neurodegenerative damage.

This isn't suitable for every person, because the wiring of each person is different.

**While dopamine itself doesn‚Äôt directly repair the brain**, activities associated with higher dopamine levels seem to enhance processes necessary for brain repair. This is an area I‚Äôve studied for years, and it continues to shape my perspective. However, society tends to demonize substances unnecessarily. Everything is toxic in excess‚Äîeven water can kill you if consumed in large quantities.

Neural regulation involves careful calibration, and nuanced treatments such as these reflect an intricate approach to managing cognitive and emotional disorders.

# The Latent INTJ:

This was based on the cognition of the brain using neural science bridged with data science and MBTI through which I created r/MBTii to align more with Jung.

# Latent Negative Behaviors:

1. **Overemphasis on strategic planning** at the expense of interpersonal connections, leading to strained relationships.
2. **Difficulty adapting strategies** in response to emotional or real-time feedback, causing rigidity in problem-solving.
3. **Attempting to plan for every possible scenario**, causing decision fatigue.
4. **Tendency to prioritize systems** and efficiency over individual or team needs, leading to alienation or reduced collaboration.
5. **Procrastination** on mundane, repetitive, or less stimulating tasks, resulting in rushed outputs or poor-quality work.
6. **Taking on more responsibilities** than manageable, often leading to overwork, burnout, and reduced productivity.
7. **Sacrificing personal health and well-being** for work or strategic goals, causing physical and mental exhaustion.
   * **Overanalyzing decisions or actions**, leading to indecisiveness and unnecessary stress.
   * **Expecting the worst-case scenario** in uncertain situations, fostering anxiety and avoidance behaviors.
   * **Bottling up frustrations** by avoiding emotional confrontation, which manifests in unhealthy ways.
   * **Ruminating on past mistakes or conversations**, which creates obsessive and unproductive thought cycles.
   * **Focusing excessively on risks**, limiting ability to enjoy present accomplishments or moments.
8. **Over-preparation** for every possible scenario, resulting in decision fatigue and delayed action.
9. **Perfectionism**, refusing to compromise on small details, causing inefficiency and missed deadlines.

# Latent Cognitive Biases:

1. **Ignoring emotional data,** which could improve decision-making.
2. **Assuming** others think similarly (false consensus effect, curse of knowledge).
3. **Favoring** overly complex solutions (bias for complexity).
4. **Believing** others understand complex systems as easily (curse of knowledge).
5. **Overestimating agreement**: Believing that others share the same opinions, values, or approaches.
6. **Faulty decision-making**: Assuming that proposed solutions or strategies will resonate with or be accepted by others without verifying alignment.
7. **Believing** others are like them and assume those people behave the same way.
8. **Emotional neglect**: Ignoring emotional cues or data that could enhance decision-making and team dynamics.
9. **Optimism bias**: Underestimating risks due to reward-driven thinking, causing overcommitment or unrealistic planning.
10. **Misjudging behavior**: Presuming that others will react to situations in the same way as the individual would, which can lead to miscommunication or conflict.

# Faults:

1. **Impatience with others‚Äô emotional struggles**, viewing emotional responses as irrational or inefficient.
2. **Isolation from others**, prioritizing intellectual or strategic pursuits over social or emotional connections.
3. **Overemphasis on long-term goals**, neglecting immediate needs or practical concerns.
4. **Difficulty with emotional expression**, often appearing detached or unempathetic in group settings.
5. **Frustration with teamwork or collaboration**, especially in environments that lack clear structure or strategic alignment.
6. **Tendency to over-commit,** leaving insufficient bandwidth for effective execution.
7. **Difficulty delegating tasks,** believing others may not meet expected standards.
8. **Avoidance of emotional conflicts,** preferring to retreat into logical reasoning instead of addressing interpersonal tensions.
9. **Resistance to compromise,** when it conflicts with their vision or strategic goals. They are quick to remove all else, except for key components. 
10. **Excessive reliance on logic,** often overlooking the importance of intuition or emotional nuance.
11. **Struggles with spontaneous decision-making,** preferring deliberate and calculated approaches.

# Cognitive and Emotional Limitations:

1. **Emotional detachment:** Difficulty understanding or connecting with others‚Äô emotions, which may lead to miscommunication or strained relationships.
2. **Frustration with inefficiency,** causing tension in teams that work at a slower or less methodical pace.
3. **Tendency to overlook the human element in problem-solving,** prioritizing outcomes over processes or relationships.
4. **High expectations of others,** which can alienate team members or peers who feel inadequate under such scrutiny.
5. **Struggles with self-forgiveness,** leading to an internal cycle of self-criticism and diminished confidence.

# Cognitive Weaknesses:

1. **Struggles with having the ability to care with emotions of others,** because a feedback look exists which dismantles their mindset, and thus must avoid at all costs.
2. **Frustration with simplicity** or repetitive tasks, preferring complexity.
3. **Optimism bias:** underestimating risks due to reward-driven outcomes.
4. **The preference for isolation**, which risks antisocial behaviors.

# Work-Related Weaknesses:

1. **Struggles with high emotional intelligence demands**, such as being therapists (though good psychologists), teaching, or conflict resolution roles, which are parts of emotional intelligence that INTJ can struggle with. 
2. **Frustration with high-pressure, reactive roles**, such as emergency response or crisis management, preferring controlled, thought-out actions.
3. **Aversion to repetitive, low-cognitive-demand tasks**, leading to disengagement or decreased performance in such roles. (I personally and deeply admire ISTJ, INTP, and INFP for being able to do these things. ISTJ especially, **they are mainly there just to get things done so that they can procrastinate after.**)
4. **Disinterest in roles with minimal strategic or analytical components**, such as clerical or purely operational jobs.
5. **Frustration with ambiguity or undefined processes**, leading to an excessive need for structure and control.

I don't know why everyone wants to be an INTJ.

Because this is basically the best it's going to get:

He will get mad about something small like I ordered takeout for myself and our daughter while he was at work but didn‚Äôt get him anything BECAUSE he is the pickiest eater and the cuisine we ordered he always complains about and he wouldn‚Äôt be home for 3 hours plus he gets his own food delivery service 6 days a week for himself‚Ä¶.

So he comes home earlier than he was supposed to, daughter and I just finished eating. I tell him and tell him why I didn‚Äôt order him anything and he goes ‚Äúyou still should have ordered m something or asked me‚Äù‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm like ‚Äú but every single time we get that food you say it‚Äôs garbage taste and don‚Äôt eat it plus you weren‚Äôt supposed to be home for 3pre hours‚Ä¶did you not eat?‚Äù 

Proceeds to tell me he didn‚Äôt eat anything except coffee and it‚Äôs now 1pm. This is an ongoing thing where a 26 year old with money and a vehicle does not stop to get himself food if it‚Äôs not packed for him‚Ä¶. And somehow it‚Äôs my fault.

So for the next 3.5 hours he‚Äôs quiet. Not answering me and when he does answer he‚Äôs passive aggressive. We‚Äôre going to go to Costco and he gets himself ready then I ask him to get our toddler ready and he says he has to take care of himself ( he usually wouldn‚Äôt get her ready IF I ask so I know he‚Äôs doing it because he‚Äôs mad). I ask him what wrong repetitively and he doesn‚Äôt say anything so eventually I get tired I get frustrated and it‚Äôs noticeable. 

At this point I don‚Äôt want to do anything with him. Costco trip is cancelled he says because ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt want to go‚Äù‚Ä¶. My fault because my mood is now crappy because he won‚Äôt communicate his feelings? 

I try so hard to communicate but he doesn‚Äôt want to and he even says he doesn‚Äôt want to. We are going on a trip tomorrow and I made a list of things for us to do before the house sitters come. I put it up so we could do it together. He doesn‚Äôt care. He never cares. We both work. But he makes more money because our daughter is my sole responsibility so I can‚Äôt work my business to the max like he can. But somehow he doesn‚Äôt do anything around the house. Like nothing. I asked him to nail a big standing mirror to the wall over 6 months ago because it‚Äôs fallen twice near our cats and we have a toddler so it‚Äôs unsafe. Guess what? Still not done. 

I‚Äôm just getting tired. This passive aggressive stuff doesn‚Äôt fly with me and the fact that he watches me get more frustrated to the point I‚Äôm crying and still continues to be a jerk makes me think he enjoys seeing me that way. 

Then suddenly he‚Äôll start laughing and hug me then say ohhh come here it‚Äôs okayyyyy let‚Äôs go do something. 

Wtf is this? 

I‚Äôm so sad this might not workout. I hate to break up my family but I can‚Äôt be a great mom when this stuff keeps happening. Exposing my toddler to these situations breaks my heart.



*** to add to this. He is a nice loving guy outside of these moments. It‚Äôs like he gets triggered but the issue is he won‚Äôt self reflect.

1hkbomv,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1hkbomv/christmas_horror_story_the_naughty_list/,Christmas Horror Story - The Naughty list ,"The wrought-iron gates loomed in front of us, crowned with intricate patterns of ivy and roses. Beyond them, the community spread out like a perfectly manicured paradise. The streets were lined with identical houses, each painted in muted pastels, their lawns trimmed to military precision. It was supposed to be a new beginning for us‚Äîfor me. At least, that‚Äôs what Mom and Dad kept saying.

‚ÄúMike, this is what‚Äôs best for you,‚Äù Mom said softly, her voice trembling as she avoided my eyes.

Dad added in his no-nonsense tone, ‚ÄúYou need structure, discipline. This place will help us all.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt argue. What was the point? After months of therapy sessions, school meetings, and whispered arguments late at night, it was clear they thought I was the problem. So, here we were, moving into Willow Haven‚Äîthe pristine, gated community where troublemakers supposedly became angels. I didn‚Äôt buy it.

The first few weeks passed uneventfully. School was stricter, and the kids were‚Ä¶ off. Polite to a fault, always smiling, always obedient. It was like they‚Äôd been brainwashed. The adults, too, seemed unnaturally cheerful, exchanging pleasant conversations while sipping their overpriced coffee. Everything felt staged, like some Stepford nightmare.

Then Christmas came.

The neighborhood transformed overnight. Lights and decorations appeared on every house. A massive tree was erected in the central park, its ornaments glittering like tiny stars. But the festive cheer felt hollow, like a mask hiding something darker.

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt we put up decorations?‚Äù I asked Mom one evening. She flinched at the question, her hands shaking as she arranged a plate of cookies.

‚ÄúWe‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre keeping it simple this year,‚Äù she murmured, not meeting my gaze. Dad walked in, his face stony, and shot her a look that made her shrink.

Something was wrong.

The night of the Christmas gathering arrived. Every family was required to attend. We gathered in the community hall, a grand building with vaulted ceilings and crystal chandeliers. The air buzzed with nervous energy as kids and parents whispered among themselves.

‚ÄúWhy does everyone look like they‚Äôre at a funeral?‚Äù I whispered to a girl standing next to me. She was pale, her eyes darting around like a trapped animal.

‚ÄúShut up,‚Äù she hissed. ‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt say anything.‚Äù

The room fell silent as Mr. Grayson, the head of the community association, stepped onto the stage. He was a tall man with a perpetual smile that never reached his cold, gray eyes.

‚ÄúWelcome, friends,‚Äù he began, his voice smooth as silk. ‚ÄúTonight, we continue our most cherished tradition: the Naughty and Nice List.‚Äù

My stomach churned. I‚Äôd heard whispers about the lists but assumed it was some dumb holiday gimmick. As he spoke, two women appeared with a massive book bound in black leather. They set it on the podium, and Grayson opened it with reverence.

‚ÄúAs always,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúthose on the Nice List will be rewarded for their good behavior. And those on the Naughty List‚Ä¶‚Äù He paused, his smile growing wider. ‚Äú‚Ä¶will receive the consequences they‚Äôve earned.‚Äù

The air grew heavy, suffocating. Names were called one by one, each child stepping forward to receive a silver pin for Nice or a red pin for Naughty. When my name was announced, I froze.

‚ÄúMichael Carter. Naughty List.‚Äù

Mom let out a strangled sob. Dad‚Äôs jaw tightened, but he didn‚Äôt move to stop me as two men in dark suits approached.

‚ÄúWhat the hell is this?‚Äù I demanded, backing away. The men grabbed my arms, their grip like iron.

‚ÄúMom? Dad?‚Äù I yelled, panic clawing at my chest. ‚ÄúDo something!‚Äù

Mom‚Äôs face crumpled, tears streaming down her cheeks. Dad‚Äôs eyes were cold, distant.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs for your own good, Mike,‚Äù he said.

They dragged me outside, past the festive lights and into the woods. The deeper we went, the darker it became. Finally, we reached a clearing lit by a roaring bonfire. Around it stood other kids from the Naughty List, their faces pale with terror.

‚ÄúWhat is this?‚Äù I demanded, struggling against my captors. No one answered.

The adults formed a circle, chanting in low, guttural voices. The fire roared higher, sparks flying into the night sky. One by one, the kids were pushed toward the flames. They screamed, fought, begged, but it didn‚Äôt matter. The fire consumed them, their cries echoing in the dark until there was nothing left but silence.

When my turn came, I thrashed wildly, screaming obscenities, pleading for my life. They forced me to my knees, the heat of the fire scorching my skin.

‚ÄúStop! Please! I‚Äôll be good, I swear!‚Äù I sobbed.

But their faces were blank, devoid of mercy. Grayson leaned down, his smile never wavering.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing personal, Michael. Just tradition.‚Äù

Then everything went black.

When I woke up, I wasn‚Äôt me anymore. My body was gone, replaced by roots and bark. I was a tree, my branches reaching toward the sky. I could see everything‚Äîthe other trees, the town, the kids playing in the park. I could see Mom sitting beneath me, her shoulders shaking as she cried.

Ms. Kim sat by her own tree, whispering apologies to the daughter she had lost. The truth hit me like a thunderclap: the trees weren‚Äôt just trees. They were us.

And now, I would stand here forever, a silent witness to the horrors of Willow Haven.

Mom came every day, sitting beneath my branches and weeping. I wanted to comfort her, to tell her I was still here, but I couldn‚Äôt. I could only watch as the cycle continued, year after year, new kids disappearing into the flames, their ashes feeding the roots of this cursed place.

The gates of Willow Haven remained closed, locking in its dark secrets. And I could do nothing but grow.",1,1734913351.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1hkbntr,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hkbntr/dialing_in_advice_needed_breville_the_oracle/,Dialing in Advice Needed [Breville The Oracle],"Hi Team,

Long time lurker, first-time poster here.

I am absolutely at my wits' end with this machine. I recently purchased the Breville The Oracle, upgrading from the Breville Barista Express, mainly to speed up and simplify my coffee workflow since having a baby and taking on an even more demanding job, which has significantly reduced my time in the kitchen.

The issue with this machine, as noted in various threads and posts online, is that the dosage varies wildly. I know this topic has probably been beaten to death (apologies), but I am extremely disappointed with this machine that costs around $2k (AUD). I am getting anywhere between 20.5 grams to 24 grams using the double basket. I've tried multiple beans, brands, and roasts, but the output varies drastically between shots, even when no variables change. It's baffling how this machine gets so much praise‚ÄîI‚Äôm not sure if I'm doing something wrong, but it just won't stay consistent, even when I control all external variables as much as possible.

Additionally, changing the grind size by just one level (either coarser or finer) results in drastically different outcomes when it comes to espresso yield. For example, a size 16 grind results in 22 grams yielding 60 grams of espresso, while a size 15 grind results in 21.5 grams yielding only 38 grams of espresso. What changed here? I have no clue.

I'm now starting to experience buyer's remorse and am considering returning this machine altogether. I wanted to love it‚Äîin theory, it's an awesome workflow and perfect for my needs‚Äîbut its inconsistent dosing and shots are driving me insane.

So here‚Äôs my question: Does anyone have any tips on improving this issue? Am I stuck with this problem if I keep this unit? If this machine is not appropriate for me, can you recommend a different unit? I think I might need a separate grinder and espresso machine, as it seems the built-in grinder and auto-tamping unit could be the issue.

Apologies for the somewhat rambling post.",1,1734913281.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

1hkblfr,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hkblfr/feel_very_confused_by_this_girl/,Feel very confused by this girl ,"Two months ago, I (18M) started talking to this cute girl at my high school. From the beginning, things felt confusing with her. Almost every interaction had to be initiated by me. You might think, 'You're chasing her, and she‚Äôs just not interested,' but it didn‚Äôt feel that way. She would even complain that I acted like I didn‚Äôt care or was gaslighting her, which felt completely untrue to me.

We‚Äôd see each other almost every day during lunch at school. She‚Äôd come over to me but would often just sit quietly or say things like ""how are you"" feel mechanical or obligatory rather than meaningful or exciting. Honestly, her behavior was a bit of a turnoff for me, but I kept talking to her anyway. Outside of school, though, we rarely spoke. I once offered to drive her home from school or go out for coffee, but she declined, saying she didn‚Äôt know if she could trust me or if I might hurt her, which I completely respected.

Last Friday, we were chatting on Instagram, and she admitted she liked me. We agreed to meet at school the next day. However, I didn‚Äôt go to school that day, and when I went back the following day, she completely ignored me. We haven‚Äôt spoken since. Four days later, I saw on Instagram that she has a boyfriend now. Have you ever dealt with someone who seemed interested but also sent confusing signals? How did you handle it? Is it worth trying to talk to her again for clarity, or should you just move on and accept how things turned out? What‚Äôs the biggest takeaway you‚Äôve had from a similar confusing or one-sided relationship experience?",1,1734913073.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

The facts:
Dated casually from March 2023-March 2024
I never wanted to make it official
Often felt pressured to leave: he'd pull the mental health card on me (originally planned to leave in Dec 2023)

All contact ended June 2024 (periods of no contact, followed by him incessantly contacting me until I caved - my fault with boundaries, I know).

He proceeded to send letters to my house in June, I never replied. I finally blocked him on all social media & his number.

Left the country for 2 (July, August) months for work related travel.

September 2024: I returned to my martial arts class. 

Disclaimer: he did these classes with me for about 2 months when we were dating. At the breakup, I said: Please don't come to my work, don't show up at my house, don't come to the martial arts classes we used to go to. He agreed. 

October 2024: He registered and joined my class.

I told front desk, my teacher and close classmates about his history, the letters, the incessant contact until blocked. Nothing anyone could do. 

It's now December 2024... he's still showing up to the classes. He has not made an effort to speak to me, and I do not make any contact. I look right through him and continue going to my classes. I will not change my life because he feels like he can creep me out.

He is still always wearing a bracelet gift that I gave him back when we were together/dating.

His new water bottle is covered in stickers that refer to our old inside jokes.

I thought he would give up and leave eventually, but it doesn't seem to be happening.

Do I get over it since there is no contact? 

Do I escalate things? 

Do I worry? Will things get worse?

I know that switching schools is an option, but I've been going for a year and have developed a community with my classmates and teacher. I've never told them not to - but none of my classmates talk to him. He's on his own before/during and after class. 

Classmates always walk me to my car now and I am never alone there.

I used to go to caf√©s by myself, but lately I have more social anxiety about this and end up staying home more, or having my coffee in my car instead.

Tldr: ex who wouldn't take no for an answer joined my martial arts class. It's been 3 months, no speaking, no contact, seems like he's here to stay. What do I do?",1,1734912997.0,u_These_Wallaby5010,0,0.99,False

My room isn't that big. It's never been ideal but it's all I got. Somehow one day I might figure out a better way to place everything in my room so my bed is in the ideal position for listening at night. 

The speakers are on their own stand but not filled with any sand. They've been very rock solid so far hardly ever needing to be rebooted. It's not a big thing once in a while, the app needs and speakers need rebooting and restarting. 

I can't really place my bed in the middle as I wouldn't be able to get to my wardrobe. I can eventually get rid of the computer table and the big computer and the coffee table etc.. so that will help a little. 

Do I need any toe in ? I mean the speakers are like 20-25cm from the wall. But they are sealed design from B&W. I can say I own a ¬£4500 setup and got them at a bargain for ¬£2300.  Speakers ¬£1800, + ¬£450 for the stands. 

It's my best sounding system yet. I'm really chuffed with them. I was worried the treble would be fatiguing and harsh but it isn't with these. It's smooth and clean and it really depends on the tracks. Treble can be forward but never ear aching.

Maybe later on I can do something with the placement of everything in my room to help them sound better. I'm sorry I really don't have a perfect room. But it sounds good to me.",10,1734912889.0,audiophile,25,0.81,False

Sipping on ice water has been it's own misery. I also can't stand cold drinks. I think it's genetic.

My great-aunt only drank tea and always pushed away the glass of ice water. Even cold from the tap water hasn't been going down painlessly, so the ice has been necessary and pretty torturous. Dressing in layers helped, marginally.

I had a cold brew this morning with too much almond milk. It went down smoothly. About an hour ago, it dawned on me that I should see if carbonation is still an issue. And it wasn't!!!

1hkbinw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ELATeachers/comments/1hkbinw/how_to_set_up_oral_final_exams_and_public/,How to set up Oral Final Exams and Public Speaking Assessments,"How I Teach Public Speaking in HS English  (25 Years Running!)

I wanted to share my system for teaching and assessing public speaking in my AP Language and 11th grade American Literature classes. This has evolved over 25 years of teaching, and while the logistics--like switching from egg timers to Google Slide timers--have changed since 2000, the basic moves are the same.

For context, we spend much of my first semester American Lit and AP Language on argumentation and rhetorical analysis, so they're familiar with the structure of arguments and some seminal American speeches, like Lincoln's 2nd Inaugural Address, but this year I also had them read and view and critique some more contemporary and effective speeches, like Emma Gonzalez' ""March for Our Lives"" speech and movie speeches, like ""The Cerulean Monologue"" from \*The Devil Wear Prada (\*When I teach college classes, I also use Alec Baldwin's ""Coffee Is for Closers"" speech from *Glengarry Glen Ross* to illustrate how a speaker can invoke pathos, ego and ""fear of loss,"" but even though I teach in California, I'd strongly suggest not showing that particular monologue to HS kids--at least, if you like your job.)

The summative assessment is a 2-3 minute speech on a contemporary, debatable topic that serves as their final exam. But the cooking with Crisco happens in the three weeks leading up to it. Every day, we kick off class with ""Table Topics"" (borrowed from Toastmasters). Students write random topics on sticky notes (with their names on the back), and one student speaks for a minute on a randomly drawn topic. Pro tip: collect and screen these topics a week before starting to avoid any, uh, ""creative"" submissions.

During these daily warm-ups, which only take about 7-10 minutes, we focus on a different speaking skill each day - starting with basics like posture and eye contact, then moving to projection, organization, and gestures. I have a student timekeeper (no phones allowed in my class, so use a Google Slide or even an egg timer), and we only allow positive feedback from classmates. Quick, supportive, and effective.

For their actual final speeches, I'm pretty open about topics. Aside from obvious no-gos like hate speech or lunatic fringe conspiracy theories, students can tackle anything from ""Pineapple doesn't belong on pizza"" to serious social issues. I just remind them to consider their audience - in a class of 36, chances are someone has personal experience with weightier topics like abortion or gun violence.

The logistics are crucial: Two weeks before, they submit a SOAPSTone graphic organizer for feedback (usually telling them to narrow their focus). Then 2-3 days before speaking, they must submit their speech in both a provided Google Doc and through Turnitin. Being strict about these deadlines is essential - with over 100 students, last-minute surprises are a nightmare. Plus, between Turnitin flags and revision histories, it helps catch any AI shenanigans.

On presentation day, I display a YouTube timer behind them (embedded in Google Slides) counting down from 3 minutes. They get a grace period of 1 minute until 4 minutes is up, when I politely cut them off. I take volunteers first - they usually set a high bar! Each student has 5-6 predetermined peer evaluators who provide anonymous feedback via Google Doc, rating their ideas, organization, and use of language.

I schedule this across 2-hour exam blocks Wednesday through Friday, with an early option on Tuesday. We take a breather at the 45-minute mark - yes, they can check their phones briefly, but devices get collected again before we resume. I can typically fit in 36 kids this way.

This system has worked well for me, creating a supportive environment. In addition to AP Language, I teach 3 sections of ELD/SpEd, so I have the full range of kids with confidence levels, multi-lingual learners and special needs. The gradual build-up with Table Topics really helps them get comfortable with public speaking, and the peer feedback keeps everyone engaged.

Anyone else have a similar system? I'd love to hear your variations or questions!",3,1734912828.0,ELATeachers,1,1.0,False

Wives:
Meri is still my favorite wife. I‚Äôm not disturbed by her imperfections at all. They make me like her more. Yes, the emotional affair was extremely selfish and potentially damaging for Leon, but people are shades of grey. I guess she just strikes me as the most authentic to this point. 

Christine is a dark horse and went from being most hated to a close second favorite. She is that meme of the dog sitting at the coffee table in the burning house going ‚Äúeverything is fine‚Äù. She‚Äôs like, we are all fucked, but I‚Äôm going to have fun, mind my business and take care of my kids. Fuck everybody else. Want me to smile and be happy for Robyn and her kids? Sure. Just make sure the bills are paid.

Janelle is kind of boring at this point.

Sobbin‚Äô Robyn went from Disney Princess to sneaky witch. You can see how not invested in the sister wife thing she is and I can‚Äôt believe she fooled me. She had one intention from the very beginning - get Kody. I don‚Äôt believe that she actually cares about any of the kids that aren‚Äôt hers biologically. She had an agenda. Get a man, trap him and get him to adopt financial and legal responsibility for her existing children. And she‚Äôs isolating Christine and Janelle while manipulating Meri into thinking they are besties, but I trust that Meri has enough life experience to know what‚Äôs going on and is reverse using her (like with using adopting her kids to get out of her legal marriage with Kody).

Kody:
Now I have an uncle just like him and even when I was a little kid and didn‚Äôt understand much about life I KNEW deep down in my soul that I didn‚Äôt like him and couldn‚Äôt explain why. In my older age, he proved to be a manipulative, narcissistic womanizer and every dream he ever painted for his family crumbled into lies and that was the point at which the charm died and the real monster came visible. Kody definitely is cracking and starting to show his true colors at this point in the show. 

The Kids:
I love the older kids, especially Aspyn and Maddie. The younger kids, I mostly feel sorry for because they don‚Äôt have the age or agency they need to accomplish the distancing that the older kids are and it‚Äôs sad to see them be manipulated by this man knowing that they will eventually be hurt by his actions.

The ketogenic diet has taken the health and wellness world by storm, promising rapid weight loss and numerous health benefits. But what are keto diet restrictions, and how can they impact your journey to better health? Understanding the specific dietary limitations is crucial for anyone considering this low-carb, high-fat eating approach. Many people dive into the keto lifestyle without fully comprehending the intricate food restrictions that make this diet unique. Click here to learn more for a healthier you: https://customketodiet.myofferdeals.com

What Are Keto Diet Restrictions?

The ketogenic diet is more than just a typical weight loss plan ‚Äì it's a complete dietary transformation that requires careful food selection and strict nutritional tracking. At its core, the diet aims to push your body into a metabolic state called ketosis, where it burns fat for fuel instead of carbohydrates.

Key Macronutrient Restrictions

**Carbohydrate Limitations**
The most critical restriction in the keto diet is carbohydrate intake. Typically, dieters must limit carbs to:
- 20-50 grams per day
- Less than 10% of total daily caloric intake
- Primarily from low-carb vegetables and select nutrient-dense sources

Click here to learn more for a healthier you: https://customketodiet.myofferdeals.com

Forbidden Food Categories

**High-Carb Foods to Avoid**
Several food groups are completely off-limits for keto dieters:
1. Grains and grain-based products
2. Sugar and sugary foods
3. Most fruits
4. Starchy vegetables
5. Processed snacks and baked goods

Detailed Carbohydrate Restrictions

**Understanding Carb Content**
Different foods have varying carbohydrate levels that can quickly derail ketosis:
- Bread: Typically 15-20g per slice
- Rice: Approximately 45g per cup
- Potatoes: Around 30g per medium potato
- Pasta: Nearly 45g per serving

Protein Consumption Guidelines

While protein is essential, **excessive protein can also prevent ketosis**. The recommended protein intake is:
- 0.6 to 0.8 grams per pound of lean body mass
- Moderate consumption to maintain muscle mass
- Focus on high-quality protein sources like:
  - Grass-fed beef
  - Wild-caught fish
  - Organic chicken
  - Eggs

**Hidden Carbohydrate Traps**

Many seemingly keto-friendly foods contain hidden carbohydrates:
- Some dairy products
- Certain nuts
- Condiments and sauces
- Processed meats

Beverage Restrictions

**Drinks to Avoid**
Certain beverages are strictly prohibited:
1. Regular soft drinks
2. Fruit juices
3. Beer
4. Sweetened tea and coffee
5. Alcohol with high sugar content

Recommended Alternatives:
- Water
- Unsweetened tea
- Black coffee
- Bone broth
- Limited amounts of approved low-carb alcoholic beverages

Micronutrient Considerations

**Potential Nutritional Gaps**
Keto diet restrictions can lead to potential nutrient deficiencies:
- Reduced fruit and vegetable intake
- Limited whole grain consumption
- Decreased fiber intake

Recommended supplements:
- Multivitamins
- Electrolyte supplements
- Omega-3 fatty acids
- Vitamin D
- Magnesium

ALOT of us has a cool UFO story, where you saw a light in the sky, you'd joke with your friends, ""oh, it might be!"" But it's different when it's hovering above your camp at 2:30am whilst camping with your girlfriend in the middle of f***ing nowhere. I can't recall the first time I seen one, because I've seen a lot. At first it'd be a little dot. Like a star, except when you look at it you notice it kind of sways back and forth erratically, then would disappear only to reappear somewhere close by, and repeat until it just shoots off to wherever, but I remember first time I knew it was a UFO. Was Halloween. I was 27, I threw a kick back at my house for a bunch of friends and co- workers, and some family, two brothers, my sister, my mom andy grandfather, he'd come out back periodically to make sure no one had fallen in the fire pit.. someone, I dont remember who asked what we thought about the possibility of life outside of what we know as our planet,
I stayed quiet to see just where the conversation would go, until a friend, famous last words... ""Call out to them with your minds"", he said with a sly grin, I looked at Eddie"" shit the f*** up Eddie, not tonight!"" It was my special day, my birthday, and I haven't even cut the cake yet, German chocolate. I love it so much yet I refuse to eat it any other time, cept my b day. So its special. Anywho, Eddie with his smug ass smile laying in the chase lounge, repeated what he said, "" call out to them with your minds."" "" Eddie, stop it"" but was too late, everyone at the kickback, like 30 some people were now looking into the distance in absolute silence. I looked at my watch. It was 11:30pm. Not a second later in the distance a blue üîµ appears in the distance. Out of nowhere like it just exited light speed. Then it slowly decended to the ground. Now this was pretty far away. I couldn't make out the craft, just the blue dot. And the blue streak it left when It landed. At the same time three red dots popped in right where the blue one appeared. They also landed. This didn't boud well for me. "" The blue one isn't going to take off, watch"" my mother looked at me, and asked what made me say something like that... But as we all looked on. The three red dots took to the skies again, no blue dot, I imagined the worse scenario for our lonely traveler. And us, because they started moving towards us. Everyone cept me started freaking out. Getting their things together, my mom and grandpa went in the house, I'm yelling at Eddie. They just left, they called them here and then they left. I was mad, but that wasn't gonna do me any good, "" Mom, get grandpa and everyone in my room, cats and dogs too, Johnny, grab those 2x4s and the long screws. We barricaded the front and back door. With the 2x4's hutch, couches, entertainment center, then into the bedroom. I can't forget the look on my grandpa's face. His family came from Texas. They were cotton farmers, his dad brought them to California so he can work with Lockheed building planes for the war, my grandpa had also worked for Lockheed martin, March Air Force base and another I can't name at the moment. I couldn't tell what he was feeling at that moment, but I could see the despair. I opened my rifle safe, tossed my brother the rifle, he took point at the window and I the bedroom door, he and I back to back. Everyone else was laying down, I remember my dog and cat just staring at me, non chalantly, as if Wondering my next move, no worry, just curious, as I load my Springfield XD 45. this was not what I ever imagined I would be using it for, defense of my family, feeling silly, but still serious, as the man of the house I had to be strong. And keep us safe. light flooded in through the closed blinds and curtains. Damn this light was so bright it f***ing burns... 

I'm sitting back to back on the floor with my brother. My cats in my lap, the dogs close by, my mom sister brother and Grandpa each in their own corner of my room. All looking at one another. Each waiting for someone to say the first word. I remain silent, checked my phone, dead, checked my watch, dead, "" everybody, check your phones, what time is it."" But I could tell by the silence, all the phones were dead. The safe way closed, guns in safe, with their gunlocks on them, as I would usually put them away. Magazines empty. Ammo back in the boxes. That's weird. I thought. Un barricaded the room, in the living room we had a grandfather clock. It too stopped. Working. I turned on the news. It was 7:30am. Grandpa didn't have anything to say. He mentioned going out for a pack of smokes. Didn't see him all day. My mom took my siblings out to the beach for the day. The look on her face, said you were right. But tears in her eyes. Everyone wants to see a UFO. It's cools when it's on the horizon, but when it's  an encounter of this kind. I don't wish that on my enemies. Fast forward about four or 5 years. I'm omw to my sister's place. Surprising her with dinner. I bumped into the homie, Devon, he took one of the bags I was carrying, "" oh f*ck yeah, your cooking again? "" He asked."" Yup"", I said, he smiled ear to ear. Because I throw down, for a skinny dude, I can cook, and because life is short I spare no expense when every day could be my last. We turn the corner onto my sister's street, and what I saw next. The whole street, all cars stopped in their tracks, people out of their cars, houses, in their front yards, in the street, standing on both cars and some on their houses. All staring and pointing, before I can say wtf is going on, all I here is,"" theyre here,"" "" it's aliens"" everybody on the street. Freaking out. Some more then others. We continue towards my sister's. I could barely see lights peeking through the leaves of a massive oak tree. So I hurried to get past it, and I see 13 craft. Relatively low, but heard nothing, they were so quiet. Moving in unison, like a swarm of jellyfish. Out for a leisurely stroll. Devon asked "" what is that"", me, with attitude in my voice, "" what do you think it is"". In hindsight yes, was a dick answer. But f*** man. üòÜ Devon thought they were Chinese lanterns at first, kind of resembled them, as far as looks and speed of travel, as well as how they swayed a little as they moved across the sky, til I saw a helicopter coming from behind them, I could only assume it was curious, cuz it was fixed on the Uaps. At that same second the Uaps seemed to vibrate back and forth side to side up and down then zoom, in a flash they were gone. Cept two, just increased speed, maybe to monitor the helicopter to gauge its intention but then too vanished. We both had footage. But when I later tried to show someone later the phone wouldn't turn on. Tired of Riverside, and these encounters I moved to lake Elsinore. Was quiet, most of the time, and love living by the lake. Surrounded by mountains, so many types of landscapes. Tons of places to rock hunt, catch rattlesnakes, lots of animals. Loved the crocodile hunter growing up, rip Steve. I met this chick from Belize, we hit it off, she had never been camping, so I set it up. And we went to a spot a buddy told me about. In rattlesnake canyon, mind you I had to find out later that's what it was called. That story comes later. I set up camp. We went into town real quick for drinks and hot dog buns, and ice, we split up she went to the 99 I went to circle k. I get a call from my new friendl, "" your not gonna believe what I just found, "" she said, "" try me"" she was right. I didn't believe her. She was behind the 99 cent store,  I just found like 45 pounds of weed"". "" Bull f***ing s**t you found 45 pounds of weed. 5 minutes later. I'm standing behind the 99cent store, staring at five huge thick black trash bags, full of buds, branches, just smelling Soo dank. ""It's from a drop"" I told her. ""A what?"" She asked. "" A drop, there's alot of legals grows around here, there's tons of dispensaries, and there's industrial buildings around here's, not to mention farms that grow. They are only allowed to have some much product on the premises at any given time. So when it's time to harvest. They start with the top colas, and work their way down til they reach their limit, and they everything else gets dumped somewhere. I was privy to this. As I had friends that have identified several drop locations. And I have even found a few. Biggest being 16 pounds once. "" I'ma go get some shopping carts. I left the car at home. We hiked to the spot we decided to camp. Since it wasn't too far from the house and the stores. We brought the bags to the site started going through the bags, I pulled out plant tags that identified the strains. Blue dream, og, lake Tahoe og, and la confidential. üî•. We were in the doorway of the tent. Fire in front of us. Smoking a joint. She was smiling, I thought this was my chance to make a move, right as I was about to go in for a kiss her eyes opened up, wide AF, like she saw the world about to end. She pointed over my shoulder and yelled ""wtf, is that?"" I turned, prolly a weird look on my face, and what I saw looked like nothing I've seen before. At first I thought it could be a meteorite. Breaking through the atmosphere. With a long fiery tail. So bright. For a split second my mind was like, f***  not north Korea. But just then it stopped. As soon as it entered the atmosphere. No more fire. Just a lil white dot. She asked "" what is that? "" Without taking my eyes off it I replied"" you know what that is"". ""No I dont' I looked at her, one eyebrow raised I'm sure. "" She started packing up. "" Where you gonna go I chuckled, but scared none the less. "" What do you mean"" she asked frantically, "" we gotta get out of here right?"" "" And go where? These are extra dimensional beings that we are talking about..."" It's moving"" she stuttered, I reach for my 5 11 bag. And I pulled out my Springfield XD 45. Removed the barrel lock. And pop in a mag. Chamber it. And put another mag in my back pocket. Just as it had started to move towards us from the other side of the lake, 12 others appeared across the sky. They would wiggle back and forth. Up and down. Swell. And shrink. Buz about a bit. Disappear, and reappear, close. But each time they would be closer. I feel the other ones were scanning for something. I saw like a blue pulse eminent from the crafts periodically, but was so quick, they  appeared above the Ortega mountains. Right where the first one had just entered and parked. Before it started heading towards us. So was pretty far away. But within seconds it was no longer a dot in the sky. But a saucer shape. With white lights around the bottom of the craft. The craft hummed. At its closest point, it was about 40 50 feet above us, maybe 20 feet away but high up. Then the lights got bright. It burned. All I could see was white. Even with my eyes closed. I scrambled to get in the tent. Had to get away from the light it was too bright. And felt like it was burning us. I remember her screaming, I'm not a bad ass. I've survived horrific s**t. And you learn to take action when lives of people you care for are in danger. But in instances like these. All I can feel in the pit of my stomach, my soul, is helplessness. Id rather feel death, then not have the answers to help those I care for. But I had nothing, just as fast it it came. The light was gone. It's black again. "" What happened where are they,? What do we do?!"" ""Shhh! "" I put one finger to my lips. Mouth the words be quiet, I had my pistol and my tactical flashlight, my flashlight also had a taser. In my left hand, with my right hand over it, and my .45acp at the ready pointing out the tent door. I heard footsteps. Where we were located was a kind of cul-de-sac. Hills all around us. One way in. From above us I heard footsteps. Slowly. But steady. And firm. Step, step, step, then from the trail. Step, step, step, then the left of us. Step. Step, step, and then something kicked the box with the snacks and stuff we brought back, we heard it step on bags or something I popped out the tent tears in my eyes yelling ""you know who has my back!"" I walk with Christ, for he is my Shepard, and this is my üó°Ô∏è. But it wasn't a sword. It was my gun. Pointing at nothing, breathing frantically. ""What's there? Where are they what do you see?"" Almost like she asked it all at the same time. ""Nothing I said. Get your shit and let's go. Just your bag for now, and the bikes. I checked my phone. It was dead. Watch dead. Flashlight, you guessed it. Dead. "" But we just got those batteries"" she said, "" I know  Let's go, get in front"".  her tire was flat. Not gonna lie I wanted to get on my bike and GTFO. But I could never leave someone like this. Least of all her. I'd never forgive myself. But still, "" hurry up,, we gotta move. "" I still didn't see anything. But the bad feeling hadn't left yet. It was about 2:30 am when she first noticed it entering the atmosphere. "" The suns up"" almost spoken as if it was a question."" She was right. The sun had snuck up on us. "" F***. It had"", when we got to the road. I patched her tire with a scab. (Clueless patch. ) Pumped out her bike and headed for circle k. For coffee and civilization. And find out what time it was. When we bumped into some friends. "" Looks like you guys saw a ghost"" Melissa chuckled. We however, did not chuckled. Melissa sensed the tension. And the seriousness in my face, "" what the fuck happened?"" She asked. ""Now' s not the best time"" I started, "" what time is it?"" Dominique asked Melissa. that's the chicks names. Left that out earlier. "" 4:50am"" Melissa said, "" that's 2 and a half hours gone. "" I said. ""F**k. "" I didn't care to elaborate what might have happened. I asked Melissa and the homie she was walking with Davey to help up pack up camp and get the weed out of there. Still haven't told them what happened. I'm sure they were picking up clues but still looked pretty worried and clueless"" . What happened"" Davey asked over and over til he saw the bags. It's always fun when someone who's never seen a lot of weed, see alot of weed. It's like winning the lotto. Or your first Xmas and that bike was next to the tree. Just like you dreamed. Cept that bike was üî• AF.. lol. We make it into town. And we were chilling in the wash. More friends showed up to help us sort through the weed. Separate and bag it up. And so I can tell them what happened. Danny was there. The one who told me of the spot we camped at. Chris too. Danny was retired navy, Chris was retired army, everyone thought he was loopy. And eh, but he was smart. Rocket scientist pretty much. Super smart. Honest guy. As I start to tell the recap what had went down. Literally, Danny turns his back on us and start to walk away slowly. About 5 or 6 steps. I'm watching him. Reading his body language. When I finished, he said just loud enough for me to here. Though I don't think it was his intention to speak aloud "" they came for you too?""

Long story short, I got my start in roleplaying back during the golden age of AOL and Yahoo (anyone else remember the Red Dragon Inn back in the late 90s and early 2000s?). Ah, those were the days, right? When the biggest worry was your dial-up connection, haha.

As I'm sure you'd all agree‚Äîfinding long-term, advanced/literate writers is much more challenging these days. I have fond memories of when the process of coming up with a plot was an organic process; where you'd genuinely take the time to get to know the other person, build rapport, and allow a plot to form naturally.

That's what I'm hoping to find. With that said, I put a lot of effort into this post, so hopefully there's someone else out there who values the same things in a writing partner!

**First of all, here's a bit about me as a person:**

* I'm 30+, male, and I've written several novels and a bunch of articles, mostly in historical fiction and contemporary stories. Writing isn't just my job; it's pretty much a part of who I am.
* I'm always trying to learn something new, whether it's from books, documentaries, or just good old chatting. History and cultures fascinate me the most.
* When I'm not buried in books or work, I love to hike and take photos. There‚Äôs something about being out in nature that just clears my head.
* I love to read (especially non-fiction and historical fiction). I'm always down for swapping book recommendations, if you're also a reader!
* I love peanut butter (crunchy over smooth any day ‚Äì fight me).
* On that note, if I'm being honest, coffee isn't just a drink for me; it's a ritual!
* I'm a big fan of the simple things in life. Give me a sunset, a good laugh, or a perfect slice of pizza, and I‚Äôm set.
* I love diving into those deep, meandering conversations that start with ""what if"" and end somewhere between ""the meaning of life"" and ""why can‚Äôt we tickle ourselves?""
* Fun fact: I used to be able to recite all 50 states in alphabetical order ‚Äî a party trick born out of a grade school challenge, haha.

**Here's what I'm looking for in a writer:**

* ***Writing Style -*** I'm looking for a partner who has a strong command of the English language. I'm talking about descriptive passages that paint clear pictures, dialogue that is crisp, concise, and not overly flowery. I prefer to write in the 3rd person, past tense. I prefer modern fiction and historical fiction stories.
* ***Communication -***  Life's unpredictable! What‚Äôs important is keeping each other in the loop about our schedules and any changes in the story or our approach. A quick heads-up can make a huge difference. It's all about being honest and direct with our feedback and thoughts.
* ***Long-Term Plots -*** I'm really looking for a writing partner who's in it for the long haul and is passionate about crafting intricate, plot-driven stories. For me, the joy of roleplaying lies in developing a story that evolves over time, with twists and turns that keep us both engaged and inspired.
* ***Sense of Humor -*** Writing together should be fun and relaxed, not just a serious crafting of narratives. It‚Äôs important to me that we can both throw in a bit of humor now and then, not only in our stories but in our interactions too.

And there you have it! If you're a detail-oriented, communicative, mature, and long-term story lover, you might just be the writing partner I'm looking for.

We should totally write such a good story that our keyboards will need a vacation after we're done, haha. I hope to hear from you!",1,1734912101.0,RoleplayPartnerSearch,0,1.0,False

# Title

> [REQ] $20 for coffee and snacks. Will repay $25 within 24hrs

# Post contents

---

I'm going to be pulling either an all-nighter or a late-nighter while working from home tonight. I'm broke from paying a few bills this week and I'm due for a grocery run. In the meantime, coffee and snacks would sure be nice to help me stay up. 

$20 would be plenty, and I would really appreciate it. I can pay back $25 no problem, in the next 24hr

The person I'm working for will be sending me a PayPal payment for my work no later than tomorrow. He's incredibly reliable and I have never had issues with being paid on time. 

I just found out about this sub and I'll pay it forward when I can. And of course  I'll pay you back tomorrow: June 7, 2015

I live in Langhorne, Pennsylvania

Thank you very much

Edit: I can accept and repay with paypal",1,1734912078.0,borrowdeletes,1,1.0,False

I have a story time. I'm a non-traditional final year medical student in the US.

I went to the American Society of Hematology (ASH) conference for the 1st time in New Orleans in 2022. It was so great, I met people from all over the world.

They had different activities for trainees including a small lounge with coffee and a ping pong table.

A few chairs became available next to me in the trainee lounge. A guy sat down and introduced himself to me as a registrar from Australia. (I didn't catch his name.) He mainly worked with patients who have leukemia and lymphomas. We don't have registrars in the US, so he was trying to explain the Australian training process to me. I told him about the US one. It was complicated so we ultimately came to the conclusion that they're very different. üòÇüò≠

Two of his colleagues then entered the trainee lounge, he introduced me to them, then got up to play ping pong with one. I continued talking with the second colleague.

They all left after a few minutes. He waved bye before he left, but he never sat back down, so I didn't get his contact. I thought I might run into him again but never did. It was like an on business Cinderella story minus the ending.

I just came back from the same conference earlier this month which brought the memory back. He was so nice!! How often do Australian hematology trainees go to these international conferences? I'd love to have a global network.",15,1734912066.0,ausjdocs,3,0.89,False

I (F, 34) had met this guy (M) at a side gig I do and we have been chatting. I felt there was maybe something there as we always would stare at each for longer than normal, and slowly started coming out of my shell.

Since my team had given his team a hard time, I baked some madeleines as a thank you and it was also my friend‚Äôs birthday. I ran into him and he complimented them saying they were good and had already had 3 of them. The proceeded to ask me where I got them to where I said I made them. And he proceeded to say he liked them and I thanked him.

We share some interests in anime and manga and slowly started talking about it to where I said I had a list for him which I do. My last shift was hard and decided to shoot my shot and ask him to get coffee.

At first he seemed shocked and surprised like at first and then said maybe‚Ä¶yes. And then we got interrupted and then I was waiting for someone else to grab me an item. I then needed another item and he helped me and so when I said that we‚Äôd need to be able to contact him we exchanged phone numbers. He seemed excited and asked me if I was around for the holiday and got interrupted again where I wasn‚Äôt able to answer but then I asked if he was around and he said yes. He told me his family is all local- his sister, mom, aunt and that he‚Äôd be around.

This is the first time in a long time that I asked for a phone number so when I got it I didn‚Äôt text him until I was off. But when I did I didn‚Äôt know what to say so I took a friend‚Äôs advice which was a mistake. My friend suggested saying ‚Äúhi, thank you for the compliment on the madeleines‚Äù and I did but didn‚Äôt get a text and that was on Wednesday. Then on Friday, I sent a follow up text saying ‚Äúhey x, what are you around to this weekend? Are you around to nerd out on anime/manga?‚Äù And he did see the message on Saturday (yesterday) but didn‚Äôt reply.

I should add that I don‚Äôt date and haven‚Äôt. I‚Äôve recently come out of my shell a lot and feel more confident than I have in years due to things I‚Äôve done that have physically changed my appearance like losing weight, changing my hair, getting Invisalign and regularly working out and buying newer clothes to replace my old wardrobe which fit closer to my body now. I still continuing my weight loss journey and losing weight.

My question is- why would someone say yes and exchange phone numbers only to not reply? I guess at this point, I assume he‚Äôs not interested but why not just say no?

And also, moving forward, I was planning on just continuing to be me which is saying hi, asking how they (him and his team) are and moving on. Maybe playfully if the time presents being like ‚Äúoh yeah, I texted you‚Äù. 

I don‚Äôt know the dating norms so idk on things like reply time and waiting. I felt really good at first then spiralled and felt deflated. I am starting to put myself out there and downloaded a dating app to just become more comfortable with chatting and whatnot. 

Anyways, please share any insight to someone who has focused my life thus far on career, family, education and recently health instead of dating. I‚Äôm assuming he‚Äôs not interested and am nearly at peace with it after talking to friends and therapist. I know it‚Äôs partially my anxiety getting in the way too of wanting to close the loop. Or just in general tips to move on, self care, anything helps! Thank you in advance. ",1,1734911448.0,AskWomenOver30,3,0.67,False

When I was a kid I thought that I was supposed to like drinking straight liquor, so in my time pretending to like it I ended up liking drinking straight liquor and never really cared for any cocktail I tried, until I tried the humble espresso martini.

I tried making them twice, but I never get them to foam. I have a shitty cocktail shaker that tends to fling my drink all over the wall when it thinks I've had enough, but it should suffice. I have tried both Kalua and Baileys, and prefered the Baileys because Irish Cream was my nickname in highschool.

I like them stiff, so I tend to go heavy on the wodka. I think the problem is that my ""espresso"" is just a heavily stirred strong coffee from my french press. For christmas however, my friend is bringing some espresso from the coffee machine at work that we can use.

Anyways, here's the coherent part of my post:

I am going to try to make espresso martinis again, in this manner:

1. Put the baileys, wodka, espresso, and ice in a cocktail shaker √† l√† recipe that I will google
2. Shake violently for two minutes
3. Pry the shaker open again and pour into martini glasses which are the worst fucking glasses ever designed

The question is, will this work? Will it foam? Does anyone have any tips or pointers?

Heathers has meant a great deal to me since I was a kid, and a big part of that is due to Kim's phenomenal and now immortalised performance as Heather Chandler. She was absolutely perfect in this role, and one of my favourite parts in the movie is the Remington University party with her and Winona. Both of them were flawless.

Earlier this year, I really began researching the cast and the movie, and I was surprised to find such little information about Kim online. Most references seemed to focus on the irony of her tragic death from a brain tumour, which I found fundamentally sad. I couldn‚Äôt even locate her obituary! After some sleuthing and a premium subscription to newspapers. com, I was able to uncover her obituary as well as some other old clippings about her.

Her brother and late mother also set up a memorial fund at her former school in New York City, which you can find here:¬†[Kim Walker Shining Star Video 2022](https://www.gcschool.org/kim-walker-shining-star-video-2022).

Who knows where her acting career might have gone had she not passed away so tragically? She was clearly well-connected, given her friendships with Christian Slater and Jennifer Aniston. It's interesting to me that after Heathers, the careers of Christian, Winona, and Shannen really took off but Kim only landed one starring role in the 90s. (And of course Jennifer Aniston's career skyrocketed with Friends.)

If anyone else has information about Kim's life and career, please share! She would only be 56 if alive today. On various Facebook posts about Heathers, I've seen people post that they grew up with Kim and the consensus seems to be that she was both incredibly kind and beautiful.",4,1734911225.0,heathersmusical,4,0.75,False

How many times will I test this to make SURE it really is the caffeinated coffee making me feel like shit and it‚Äôs not my period or my mood or the weather or an off day or any other variable? Is there a threshold?  Space for even a SPLASH of the real stuff? Or does caffeine just not work for me?

I built this PC 8 years ago, and while it runs perfectly fine and I can play basically anygame I want, I decided to upgrade and get a new build for 2025 games such as MH Wilds, etc. 

If you were selling this system how much would you sell it for?

Thing is, I know this system is old af, but it has some sentimental value to me still. Should I tell my brother he would be better off using his money to make a newer but budget friendly build?

1hkaqxd,https://i.redd.it/wu40695fjh8e1.jpeg,Refilling Boiler Mistake? ,"Hey everyone, 

It was my first time using the steam wand on the GCP. After finishing steaming the milk, I went to refill the boiler by activity the brew switch however I forgot to remove the portafilter with the coffee puck still in it. I turned it off after like 1-2 seconds of noticing which then I removed the portafilter and continued to refill the boiler. 

My question and concern is if this 1-2 seconds of purge caused any harm to the machine by having the portafilter attached with the puck in it still. Like if it was too much pressure build up from the steam, etc. 

After removing and cleaning the drip tray I noticed a little bit of red silicone gasket in a perfect circle. Not sure if it was from today or yesterday. The large shower screen gasket looks all in tact, and the solenoid wand has its gasket in place as well still. Does the shower screen screw have a o ring as it looks like a perfect circle similar to a screw hole. Could this just be left over silicone from somewhere? 

Another question I have is, when I leave the portafilter in the machine when turning it on in the morning say for like 15-20 minutes to warm up, is it normal for the portafilter to be wet or is it suppose to be fully dry? Thinking if the shower head screw had a failing gasket which is why it just ripped off and fell into my drip tray. Thats even if the screw has a oring. Included photo of the rubber found in drip tray. 

Greatly appreciate if someone can chime in who are more experienced with these machines, thank you!! ",1,1734910426.0,gaggiaclassic,12,1.0,False

I drove on in a blind panic. I knew it was likely useless, but I decided to go to Lucia‚Äôs place first and see what I could find. When I got there, I saw her car was gone and the lights were turned off. I discreetly walked up and tried the door and it was unlocked. Stepping inside I saw everything was in a state of turmoil. Half-filled boxes lay scattered around and no one room was fully packed up and moved. They were rushed of course; she had not planned ahead on this and she was just desperate enough to try to do this now when she felt like her sister had no hope of recovery on her own. I let out a dejected sigh and checked my phone again, hoping that she had replied to any of my messages.  



I was scared for her and myself, I knew why she was doing it, hell if something was wrong with Sara I would have done it too. I just wished she had just told me. Now we were in a situation where Salazar wanted her dead and I was the triggerman. I knew that was why she would not respond, she couldn't, it was not safe, I was not safe. I remembered how I let slip the details about our relationship to the mental probing of Mr. Salazar and I felt guilty and hopeless. She had probably figured that Salazar would leverage my own family against my loyalty to her. I was being forced to find her and I did not honestly know what I would do if or when I did.  



I started combing through what remained and tried to look for some clue or hint as to where she might be going. After several minutes of searching, I was not finding anything useful. I almost left without anything, but something caught my eye. I saw passport application papers, not for her but for her sister Carla. It made sense, wherever they were going it was out of the country. I did not know if they could get far enough away anywhere in the world to be safe from Mr. Salazar. 



I continued looking and found a small computer and printer in her office. They must have been too large to take with her. The devices were still turned on and I tried to see if anything useful was present.  No trace was left on screen, no obvious clues. She was too clever to leave a window up with detailed plans of their escape. I thought I would try something less obvious. I reached into the toolkit and pulled out a rolled-up sheet of paper that was kept in a strange tin. I had never tried this trinket before, but Salazar said it was, 



‚ÄúGood at finding a paper trail, if you use it right.‚Äù I had a hunch and decided to place the paper in the tray of the printer and I pushed print. Nothing was in the queue and nothing happened for a few moments. Then the printer came to life and when it was finished, I saw that it had all of the details of the last thing that had printed on it. Sure, enough I saw a receipt and ticket information, two plane tickets to Tijuana. I had a destination, but the date for departure was tomorrow, I did not have that long, Salazar said I had a day to find them. 



I left with the information I had and resolved to check the hotels near the airport and hope that she was at one of them. I wrote the names of all the hotels and motels closest to the airport on a small list, I just had to hope she had picked one of those and not someplace further away or lower key. Time was running out fast and it was the only information I had to go on. To my dismay there were dozens to check, but I had no other clues to go on. I got in my car and left in a hurry, speeding out of there and towards the first place on the list.  



I was fortunate that she had taken her car, I thought it would be easier to check the parking lots of the hotels first, rather than wasting time trying to check registries and deal with staff if I did not have to. After arriving near the airport and checking a few hotels and motels I was lucky and when I got to the fourth place on the list, I saw her car parked at the Motel 6 in the area. I had to approach this delicately, it was just her and her sister, scared and on the run. I did not know if she believed I would try and hurt her, I had no intention of doing that, but would she still trust me? 



I did not bring my weapons, just my backpack with the skeleton key, in case I needed to get in. I just needed to talk to her and explain the situation. It was dangerous; I did not know if she felt the same way I did. I knew that she would put her life and the life of her sister above me, her ex-coworker and fling for the short while we were together. Honestly, who could blame her, but I wanted her to see I meant no harm, to see that I still trusted her to do the right thing and that maybe she would still trust me. We could figure this out, I just needed to talk to her. 



I had determined which room they were in when I caught a peek of a familiar shape discreetly leaving and coming back a few minutes later. I walked up to the door and decided to just lay it on the line. I knocked on the door several times and held my hands up and whispered just loud enough to be heard through the door, 



‚ÄúLucia, we need to talk.‚Äù 



There was a long pause and I heard shuffling inside and a door closing, maybe her sister locking herself in the bathroom I thought. Suddenly the door swung open and Lucia was standing there, half undressed and holding a gun on me. She looked scared and angry in equal measure. She spoke in a soft hiss, 



‚ÄúHenry what the hell are you doing here? I knew Salazar would send you after us. You don‚Äôt get it, there is no nice way this will play out. Whatever your plan is it won‚Äôt work. We need to leave and get as far away as we can from him. I can‚Äôt go back, I won‚Äôt.‚Äù Her voice started wavering and she looked strangely hopeful for a moment and continued, 



‚ÄúHenry, we can‚Äôt go back now. It..... worked, the time, somehow it just worked. My sister she isn't sick anymore. I don‚Äôt know how but it just worked and I am not giving it back to him. I won‚Äôt let her die, so that some rich creep gets to live with the years that belong to someone innocent like her.‚Äù I saw her eyes welling with tears and I did not know what I could do or say just then to even make a case. I was disarmed literally and mentally. All I could tell her was the truth, 



‚ÄúLu, he threatened Sara. I have a day to get the Borrowed Time back to him or he.....I don‚Äôt know what he will try to do. What's worse is I don‚Äôt know if I can stop him.‚Äù My own voice started to give out and I just stood there, looking at her with a mix of desperation, conviction and hopelessness. I did not know what I expected her to say. Would she sacrifice her sister for my daughter? I did not imagine anyone would in her shoes. She looked back at me with a pained and sorrowful expression. A moment later she lowered the gun and stepped forward and embraced me. I hugged her back and we stood there for a while. We were both confused and desperate, but at least in that moment, we were together. She took a step back and grabbed my hand and said, 



‚ÄúCome with us, take Sara and convince Nancy to go. We can all leave, we just need to get out of here. Somewhere far enough away that Salazar can‚Äôt reach us.‚Äù I saw the hopeful look on her face, but knew even she did not really believe that would work.  Yet I considered our options and started to see a glimmer of hope in that desperate choice. 



After a moment, I nodded my head and told her, 



‚ÄúI will go get Sara, Nancy will have to understand, we don‚Äôt have much choice in this. We can make this work.‚Äù Lucia embraced me again and before she could say anything else, we heard an awful static squelch coming from my backpack, followed by a familiar voice, 



‚ÄúA shame Henry, I thought you were smarter than this, casting your lot in with a thief? And you Miss Ramirez, I expected much better from you. My trust is a sacred bond, a contract I had made with you to help keep my secrets, you have broken that contract. Now you owe me something more and what is owed has come due. You have both made your choices, now I have made mine. No one steals from my collection, no one's betrays my trust and no one breaks a contract with me.‚Äù  

We were both shocked and horrified as we heard Mr. Salazar's voice coming from my backpack. I should never have brought it in. I can‚Äôt believe I was so stupid and never thought that he might be tracking me, making sure I played the role of collector like always. I knew we had to do something fast, I had no idea what was going to happen to us. The pack kept talking and a vicious inflection flared up in the static laden voice of Mr. Salazar as he continued, 



‚ÄúFortunately, I had a contingency in case you failed to act Henry. You will see it soon Lucia, as for you Henry, you are fired.‚Äù We stood in stunned silence as the voice cut off and before I could take another breath the backpack suddenly burst into a fireball. The instant conflagration had set me on fire and I tried to throw the pack off as the flames seared my skin. I fell to the ground desperately rolling as I burned. Lucia was screaming and I dimly heard her shout to her sister to get water from the bathroom. 



The rolling was not putting the fire out and I felt the agony of the flames tearing at my skin. I had one last stupid idea to try and extinguish myself. I saw the outdoor pool downstairs when I came in, it was not too far of a drop. I forced myself to my feet and threw myself off the railing and plummeted down into the pool below. I sank like a rock in the water and struck the ground from the force of the fall. Fortunately, I had not hit my head and I managed to swim back to the surface. Every ounce of my body was in pain, my lungs still felt like they were on fire, but I was alive. I heard Lucia shouting something from upstairs, but I could not make it out as I bobbed in the water like a dead fish, trying to regain enough strength to swim out of there.  



I almost passed out in the water, but managed to slowly float to the edge. Lucia made it down to the pool and she helped me get out. I finally regained a bit of composure from almost being burned alive and then drowning. I saw her looking down at me and almost smiled, but then we both heard something that froze our hearts, it was a child‚Äôs scream. 



I forced myself painfully up to my feet. Lucia was already bolting back towards the stairs shouting, 



‚ÄúCarla, no! Get back inside, lock the doors.‚Äù It was too late, I saw armed men gathering near the door to their room. Several gunshots rang out and I saw Lucia firing at the them. Her aim was good and one of them crumpled to the ground. Return fire rang out and I saw Lucia taking cover by the stairs leading up to their room. In the next moment a large man exited the hotel room and he had his arm wrapped around Carla‚Äôs neck and a gun pointed at her head. To my horror I recognized this particularly large man now holding her hostage, it was the personal body guard who had come in to the store with Mr. Becket the day before. I did not know how or why he was here. I thought Salazar had sent people after us, but this seemed odd. The large man spoke in an eerily calm voice, making his demand, 



‚ÄúSurrender. We have your sister Miss Ramirez, now you will give us the hourglass or you will force me to take more direct action to ensure your compliance.‚Äù He made sure she could see the gun he was holding to Carla‚Äôs head and Lucia screamed back at him,  



‚ÄúIf you hurt her, you are a dead man!‚Äù I watched on from downstairs trying to figure out what I could do. I saw the hotel manager had emerged from the office and he saw the guns drawn. I tried to warn him to get down but he stood there dumbly for a moment and then promptly grabbed his phone to try and call the police. One of the men had seen him and without hesitation, shot him in cold blood. Their leader spoke again, ‚ÄúNo one interferes, we are here for one thing, give it to us and we will leave‚Äù  



I had an idea just then, I stood up and shouted,  



‚ÄúWait! We will give you the hourglass. Just let the girl go.‚Äù The group of men looked down at where they heard the voice and saw me standing there with my arms up. The big man had recognized me and smugly stated, 



‚ÄúAh finally someone can see reason. I knew the collectors errand boy would recognize a fight he couldn't win.‚Äù I looked over to catch a glimpse at Lucia who looked confused and then while looking directly at her I shouted, 



‚ÄúJust give them the hourglass and they will let Carla go.‚Äù I saw recognition in her eyes and she was onboard with the gambit. These were Becket‚Äôs men; they did not know that the Borrowed Time had already been used and that the hourglass was empty now. Whatever bizarre energy it had contained was currently sustaining the life of Lucia‚Äôs sister. 



Lucia raised her hands up and I went to join her. We slowly walked up the stairs and the guards had their weapons trained on us. Lucia stared daggers at the big man and told him, 



‚ÄúThe hourglass is inside; it‚Äôs in the red suitcase. Now let her go.‚Äù The man chuckled and he motioned for one of his cronies to go in and verify. He emerged a moment later holding the ornate hourglass. He handed it to his boss and the big man rolled it over in his hands. He looked back to us and then grunted and let his grip on Carla loosen enough for the little girl to escape and run toward Lucia. He looked back at us and said, 



‚ÄúWell, a deal is a deal, Mr. Becket will be thrilled. We did not even need to deal with that weird old bastard Salazar. No, not when we ended up getting a better deal from his associates. That‚Äôs right, the Hourglass for letting the girl go, a deal is a deal.‚Äù We were about to turn and walk way when he spoke again, 



‚ÄúBut....some deals leave loose ends. I did not say anything about tidying up loose ends. We don‚Äôt want Salazar sniffing around. As far as he knows you lot still have it, it would sure be convenient if you all died and his Borrowed Time just vanished. It seems like if we let you go you might be forced to tell him who had it, so.....you know, loose ends.‚Äù He nodded to his men as he turned and started walking away down the opposite staircase. The men pointed their weapons at us and I thought we were dead. Lucia was holding her sister and she was crying. I did not know what I could do. Suddenly I heard a muffled click and the tell tale sound of a subsonic crack cutting through the air. The two men aiming their weapons at us had small holes in their heads that jetted blood out onto the cheap patio railing.  



I screamed at Lucia to get down, but to my horror I saw she was already laying on the ground, a bleeding wound now blossoming on her shoulder where she had been shot as well. She covered Carla with her body and the poor girl was still screaming, even as Lucia slowly tried to drag them both out of the line of fire. 



I dove toward the slain men as I heard more muffled shots rake the stairwell, aiming for the large man now evidently. Somehow, he evaded them and I heard angry cursing as the big man tried to return fire to wherever the shooter was located. Whoever it was, they were not on his side or ours. 



I grabbed the sub machine gun that the dead guard had been carrying and I shoved both bodies together to create some makeshift cover out of their bodies. I heard gunfire from the stairwell and more cursing. While the unknown assailant was firing at the other man, I crawled over to Lucia and tried to help her move. I managed to grab ahold of her and she held onto her sister as we crawled on and through the door to their room. We just made it inside when a large arm seized the door right as I tried to close it. 



The door was thrown open and I saw Becket‚Äôs man, he was wounded but still alive and he charged forward knocking me off my feet. I dropped the sub machine gun I had recovered and it fell from my hands and outside the room right where the patio was being raked with gunfire. I took a step back but saw that the big man had lost his gun as well. He took a step inside and closed the door behind him, the sound of gunfire pinging off the nearby walls. He glared at us and shouted, 



‚ÄúCall off your man or I swear I will break your necks before he can save you.‚Äù I stood up promptly and got in between the deranged bastard and Lucia and her sister. I gestured down to Lucia and told him, 



‚ÄúOpen your eyes, he shot at us too! Whoever that is, he is not with us and you might want to get down. I ducked and the door was perforated with several more precise shots. The large man fell to his side and landed hard, breaking a nearby coffee table. 



I looked down at him and said, 



‚ÄúIf we want to get out of this we will have to work together. We wait for him to come to us, he will likely try to get in. He knows we are in here and that someone might have alerted the police and should be arriving to help at some point. He will have to make a move.‚Äù The large man winced at the mention of police but relented and shrugged his shoulders and spoke, 



‚ÄúAlright little collector, we will do it your way, just understand I am keeping the hourglass, whatever happens. Now what should we do when he gets here?‚Äù I looked over to Lucia and told her to get back and take Carla in the bathroom and lock the door. She nodded her head and started to respond, but I held up my hand as I heard a gentle creaking and the front door began to open. Next was a small clinking sound and I saw a curious little red orb on the ground. It looked strangely familiar and when I remembered where I had seen them before my heart sank. I shouted out, 



‚ÄúNo time!‚Äù And I kicked  Becket‚Äôs guard in the back of his knee and he fell forward onto his face and on top of the red orb. I dove toward the bathroom where Lucia and Carla had moved. I landed hard and heard a loud vacuum-like sound behind me. I looked back and I was shocked by the sight. Before our eyes the man had simply imploded in on himself. A shriveled sac of bloody gore was all that was left of his hulking frame. I spared the time to chuckle morbidly at the fate of Becket‚Äôs right hand man and how even though he did not steal directly from Salazar's business the same thing had happened to him. 

I guess there really was one that would implode a person. When I considered the weapon that had been deployed I realized the gravity of the danger we were still in. Only one person would have those sorts of tools. Salazar had sent someone after us. I was terrified of what else they might have brought, either tools I knew about, or horrifying new ones. Before I could rise to my feet a slender figure emerged through the doorway, they wore a strange mask and carried a large pistol and a strange looking knife. I heard a distorted voice call out, 



‚ÄúYou must be Henry, I heard a lot about you. It is a pleasure to meet you, you did some good work from what I heard. I guess I am your replacement, names Gideon. So, I won‚Äôt insult your intelligence by entertaining any other notions about what is going to happen here, the secretaries gotta die man, you know that. But Mr. Salazar said that he would be willing to spare you and your kid if you cooperate and don‚Äôt get in the way. There's still a chance to turn back, just walk away and let me handle this.‚Äù  



I slowly stood up and looked at the man, I had to think or something but I needed time. I tried to get him talking, 



‚ÄúWhy kill Becket‚Äôs men? They were about to do your job for you.‚Äù The man, Gideon as he said his name was chuckled and cocked his head slightly in what was likely a bemused expression under his mask and responded, 



‚ÄúYeah, that would have been awesome, but Becket and his guys did not have the full picture. The hourglass is useless when that kido has the time. Pretty sure we have to put it back in the hourglass. Could not have him shooting her in the head. I don‚Äôt think that stuff makes you bullet proof and I did not want to risk losing it. Plus, Becket tried to cheat Mr. Salazar, they had a deal beforehand and he tried to cut us out. I didn't even know they would be here, but once Salazar finds out, he might have to add some extra strings to the contract if that dinosaur Becket still wants his time after trying to screw us.‚Äù I nodded my head and tried to keep him talking but he cut me off and stated plainly, 



‚ÄúNo time for chit chat, what's it gonna be Henry? I really gotta go, I don‚Äôt want to have to start killing cops, but I mean you have seen the sort of crazy shit he gives us, if I have to I have to. It is just easier to keep a low profile ya know?‚Äù 



I made my decision. I looked back to Lucia and took a step forward with my hands up. I walked toward Gideon and stood next to him with my arms still up and I responded, 



‚ÄúIf it will save my daughter, I have no choice.‚Äù I saw the color drain from Lucia‚Äôs face and Carla started crying again. The pain of betrayal on her face was unbearable and for a moment I thought I would not be able to hold my composure. 



Gideon chuckled and said, 



‚ÄúGood choice man, I knew you were the real deal. No need to die for some worker bee, not when ladies like her are a dime a dozen when you get the kind of cash you get from this gig. Anyway, time to say goodnight little lady, nothing personnel.‚Äù He aimed the gun at Lucia and I shouted out,  



‚ÄúWait, I have one last thing to say to her, please.‚Äù He held the gun up and Lucia glared at me, obviously not wanting to hear a word from me. I crossed my fingers and hoped this would work. I spoke again and uttered a single word, 



‚ÄúEvernight‚Äù In an instant all the light in the room was sucked into Gideon's bag and the room went pitch black, I only had a few moments and I hoped he would not fire a shot while still aiming at Lucia and her sister. I shifted my weight forward and executed a hard pushing kick. I stuck home and I heard Gideon cry out in pain and confusion. The unnatural darkness swallowed the flash of the firearm, but I heard the reports of several shots ringing out. I heard a clatter on the floor and I tried to follow the sound as best I could. I felt the nearby armchair and jumped onto it. There were more shots and I swear I felt one graze past my foot. I followed the sound and leaped off the chair and fell down, leading with my arm in a makeshift elbow drop on his hopefully still prone form.  



I heard another cry of pain as my elbow connected with what felt like his sternum. I tried to reach up and grab for his arms, which might still be holding his weapons. It was my turn to cry out as I felt the bite of the knife digging into my side. I painfully pulled free and I dropped to my back to avoid what I guessed where several follow up stabs directed at where I had been. I had been trying to count the time since activation and I knew I had a few more seconds until the blackout was over. I had to disarm him by then or he would shoot us all. I heard another gunshot and heard something shatter in the bathroom. 



Just another moment and the light would come back, I jumped to my feet and charged toward where I had heard the shot. I had to get this right. The light came back and Gideon saw me. He tried to level the gun at me, but I jumped and threw my weight at him in a desperate dropkick. My weight sent him flying toward the open door. He was reeling and tried to recover near the railing outside the room. I saw that he was too far away when I got back to my feet and I knew I had miscalculated. He got back to his feet and once again took aim at me, I thought it was over, until I heard several shots from behind. Salazar‚Äôs new collector looked down at the multiples wounds on his chest and let out a pained gasp as he toppled over the railing and into the pool just as I had fallen into earlier. Something told me he would not be climbing out. 



I looked behind and saw Lucia, her own gun still smoking. She was panting and still bleeding bad from the wound on her shoulder but when she saw me smiling at her she moved up to me and slapped me in the face. I was confused and then she said, 



‚ÄúThat is for scaring my sister.‚Äù As I reeled from the blow with a pained and confused grunt, she pulled me in and kissed me. When she pulled away, she was smiling and before I could respond she said, 



‚ÄúThat is for saving both of us.‚Äù I smiled back and thanked her for saving me as well. The relief faded from her face and she winced in pain, as the adrenaline wore off and she was reminded of the fact she had been shot. I helped her sit down and got a first aid kit from the car and helped her dress the wound. Fortunately it had gone clean in and out, but it was still bad. She would need to see a doctor, but it would work for now. I took the small packet of burn ointment in the kit and applied it on a hilariously small portion of the awful burns I had across my body. The bleeding stab wound was patched up as best I could as well. I also taped my hands up so that it would not hurt so much to grasp things. I felt like complete hell but I was alive.



Carla was still hiding in the bathroom, she refused to come out. I knew the poor thing was likely traumatized by all the events she just had to witness. Lucia eventually got her to come out and tried to comfort her and I sat down next to them, completely exhausted. My mind was racing and I had to think of something we could do. I knew what was likely the only option I had left and it terrified me just thinking about it. After a few minutes I came to a grim acceptance of the truth and felt emboldened by the desperate realization that if this did not work, we would all be dead.  I had no idea how I would do it, but I had no other option. The only way to stop this once and for all would be to take out Salazar. If I stopped him, Sara would be safe, Lucia and her sister would be safe, we all would be. 



I stood up and spoke to them both,  



‚ÄúWe have to get out of here. The police will get here eventually and there is a lot more to explain here than I think we can. Worse still, Salazar is going to send someone else eventually. You two need to get somewhere safe, I need to get back to the office.‚Äù Lucia looked confused and upset by my declaration. She said, 



‚ÄúWhy in the world would you go back there?‚Äù 



I smiled and replied, 



‚ÄúTo tell the boss that he can‚Äôt fire me, I quit.‚Äù  ",3,1734910414.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

I drove on in a blind panic. I knew it was likely useless, but I decided to go to Lucia‚Äôs place first and see what I could find. When I got there, I saw her car was gone and the lights were turned off. I discreetly walked up and tried the door and it was unlocked. Stepping inside I saw everything was in a state of turmoil. Half-filled boxes lay scattered around and no one room was fully packed up and moved. They were rushed of course; she had not planned ahead on this and she was just desperate enough to try to do this now when she felt like her sister had no hope of recovery on her own. I let out a dejected sigh and checked my phone again, hoping that she had replied to any of my messages.  



I was scared for her and myself, I knew why she was doing it, hell if something was wrong with Sara I would have done it too. I just wished she had just told me. Now we were in a situation where Salazar wanted her dead and I was the triggerman. I knew that was why she would not respond, she couldn't, it was not safe, I was not safe. I remembered how I let slip the details about our relationship to the mental probing of Mr. Salazar and I felt guilty and hopeless. She had probably figured that Salazar would leverage my own family against my loyalty to her. I was being forced to find her and I did not honestly know what I would do if or when I did.  



I started combing through what remained and tried to look for some clue or hint as to where she might be going. After several minutes of searching, I was not finding anything useful. I almost left without anything, but something caught my eye. I saw passport application papers, not for her but for her sister Carla. It made sense, wherever they were going it was out of the country. I did not know if they could get far enough away anywhere in the world to be safe from Mr. Salazar. 



I continued looking and found a small computer and printer in her office. They must have been too large to take with her. The devices were still turned on and I tried to see if anything useful was present.  No trace was left on screen, no obvious clues. She was too clever to leave a window up with detailed plans of their escape. I thought I would try something less obvious. I reached into the toolkit and pulled out a rolled-up sheet of paper that was kept in a strange tin. I had never tried this trinket before, but Salazar said it was, 



‚ÄúGood at finding a paper trail, if you use it right.‚Äù I had a hunch and decided to place the paper in the tray of the printer and I pushed print. Nothing was in the queue and nothing happened for a few moments. Then the printer came to life and when it was finished, I saw that it had all of the details of the last thing that had printed on it. Sure, enough I saw a receipt and ticket information, two plane tickets to Tijuana. I had a destination, but the date for departure was tomorrow, I did not have that long, Salazar said I had a day to find them. 



I left with the information I had and resolved to check the hotels near the airport and hope that she was at one of them. I wrote the names of all the hotels and motels closest to the airport on a small list, I just had to hope she had picked one of those and not someplace further away or lower key. Time was running out fast and it was the only information I had to go on. To my dismay there were dozens to check, but I had no other clues to go on. I got in my car and left in a hurry, speeding out of there and towards the first place on the list.  



I was fortunate that she had taken her car, I thought it would be easier to check the parking lots of the hotels first, rather than wasting time trying to check registries and deal with staff if I did not have to. After arriving near the airport and checking a few hotels and motels I was lucky and when I got to the fourth place on the list, I saw her car parked at the Motel 6 in the area. I had to approach this delicately, it was just her and her sister, scared and on the run. I did not know if she believed I would try and hurt her, I had no intention of doing that, but would she still trust me? 



I did not bring my weapons, just my backpack with the skeleton key, in case I needed to get in. I just needed to talk to her and explain the situation. It was dangerous; I did not know if she felt the same way I did. I knew that she would put her life and the life of her sister above me, her ex-coworker and fling for the short while we were together. Honestly, who could blame her, but I wanted her to see I meant no harm, to see that I still trusted her to do the right thing and that maybe she would still trust me. We could figure this out, I just needed to talk to her. 



I had determined which room they were in when I caught a peek of a familiar shape discreetly leaving and coming back a few minutes later. I walked up to the door and decided to just lay it on the line. I knocked on the door several times and held my hands up and whispered just loud enough to be heard through the door, 



‚ÄúLucia, we need to talk.‚Äù 



There was a long pause and I heard shuffling inside and a door closing, maybe her sister locking herself in the bathroom I thought. Suddenly the door swung open and Lucia was standing there, half undressed and holding a gun on me. She looked scared and angry in equal measure. She spoke in a soft hiss, 



‚ÄúHenry what the hell are you doing here? I knew Salazar would send you after us. You don‚Äôt get it, there is no nice way this will play out. Whatever your plan is it won‚Äôt work. We need to leave and get as far away as we can from him. I can‚Äôt go back, I won‚Äôt.‚Äù Her voice started wavering and she looked strangely hopeful for a moment and continued, 



‚ÄúHenry, we can‚Äôt go back now. It..... worked, the time, somehow it just worked. My sister she isn't sick anymore. I don‚Äôt know how but it just worked and I am not giving it back to him. I won‚Äôt let her die, so that some rich creep gets to live with the years that belong to someone innocent like her.‚Äù I saw her eyes welling with tears and I did not know what I could do or say just then to even make a case. I was disarmed literally and mentally. All I could tell her was the truth, 



‚ÄúLu, he threatened Sara. I have a day to get the Borrowed Time back to him or he.....I don‚Äôt know what he will try to do. What's worse is I don‚Äôt know if I can stop him.‚Äù My own voice started to give out and I just stood there, looking at her with a mix of desperation, conviction and hopelessness. I did not know what I expected her to say. Would she sacrifice her sister for my daughter? I did not imagine anyone would in her shoes. She looked back at me with a pained and sorrowful expression. A moment later she lowered the gun and stepped forward and embraced me. I hugged her back and we stood there for a while. We were both confused and desperate, but at least in that moment, we were together. She took a step back and grabbed my hand and said, 



‚ÄúCome with us, take Sara and convince Nancy to go. We can all leave, we just need to get out of here. Somewhere far enough away that Salazar can‚Äôt reach us.‚Äù I saw the hopeful look on her face, but knew even she did not really believe that would work.  Yet I considered our options and started to see a glimmer of hope in that desperate choice. 



After a moment, I nodded my head and told her, 



‚ÄúI will go get Sara, Nancy will have to understand, we don‚Äôt have much choice in this. We can make this work.‚Äù Lucia embraced me again and before she could say anything else, we heard an awful static squelch coming from my backpack, followed by a familiar voice, 



‚ÄúA shame Henry, I thought you were smarter than this, casting your lot in with a thief? And you Miss Ramirez, I expected much better from you. My trust is a sacred bond, a contract I had made with you to help keep my secrets, you have broken that contract. Now you owe me something more and what is owed has come due. You have both made your choices, now I have made mine. No one steals from my collection, no one's betrays my trust and no one breaks a contract with me.‚Äù  

We were both shocked and horrified as we heard Mr. Salazar's voice coming from my backpack. I should never have brought it in. I can‚Äôt believe I was so stupid and never thought that he might be tracking me, making sure I played the role of collector like always. I knew we had to do something fast, I had no idea what was going to happen to us. The pack kept talking and a vicious inflection flared up in the static laden voice of Mr. Salazar as he continued, 



‚ÄúFortunately, I had a contingency in case you failed to act Henry. You will see it soon Lucia, as for you Henry, you are fired.‚Äù We stood in stunned silence as the voice cut off and before I could take another breath the backpack suddenly burst into a fireball. The instant conflagration had set me on fire and I tried to throw the pack off as the flames seared my skin. I fell to the ground desperately rolling as I burned. Lucia was screaming and I dimly heard her shout to her sister to get water from the bathroom. 



The rolling was not putting the fire out and I felt the agony of the flames tearing at my skin. I had one last stupid idea to try and extinguish myself. I saw the outdoor pool downstairs when I came in, it was not too far of a drop. I forced myself to my feet and threw myself off the railing and plummeted down into the pool below. I sank like a rock in the water and struck the ground from the force of the fall. Fortunately, I had not hit my head and I managed to swim back to the surface. Every ounce of my body was in pain, my lungs still felt like they were on fire, but I was alive. I heard Lucia shouting something from upstairs, but I could not make it out as I bobbed in the water like a dead fish, trying to regain enough strength to swim out of there.  



I almost passed out in the water, but managed to slowly float to the edge. Lucia made it down to the pool and she helped me get out. I finally regained a bit of composure from almost being burned alive and then drowning. I saw her looking down at me and almost smiled, but then we both heard something that froze our hearts, it was a child‚Äôs scream. 



I forced myself painfully up to my feet. Lucia was already bolting back towards the stairs shouting, 



‚ÄúCarla, no! Get back inside, lock the doors.‚Äù It was too late, I saw armed men gathering near the door to their room. Several gunshots rang out and I saw Lucia firing at the them. Her aim was good and one of them crumpled to the ground. Return fire rang out and I saw Lucia taking cover by the stairs leading up to their room. In the next moment a large man exited the hotel room and he had his arm wrapped around Carla‚Äôs neck and a gun pointed at her head. To my horror I recognized this particularly large man now holding her hostage, it was the personal body guard who had come in to the store with Mr. Becket the day before. I did not know how or why he was here. I thought Salazar had sent people after us, but this seemed odd. The large man spoke in an eerily calm voice, making his demand, 



‚ÄúSurrender. We have your sister Miss Ramirez, now you will give us the hourglass or you will force me to take more direct action to ensure your compliance.‚Äù He made sure she could see the gun he was holding to Carla‚Äôs head and Lucia screamed back at him,  



‚ÄúIf you hurt her, you are a dead man!‚Äù I watched on from downstairs trying to figure out what I could do. I saw the hotel manager had emerged from the office and he saw the guns drawn. I tried to warn him to get down but he stood there dumbly for a moment and then promptly grabbed his phone to try and call the police. One of the men had seen him and without hesitation, shot him in cold blood. Their leader spoke again, ‚ÄúNo one interferes, we are here for one thing, give it to us and we will leave‚Äù  



I had an idea just then, I stood up and shouted,  



‚ÄúWait! We will give you the hourglass. Just let the girl go.‚Äù The group of men looked down at where they heard the voice and saw me standing there with my arms up. The big man had recognized me and smugly stated, 



‚ÄúAh finally someone can see reason. I knew the collectors errand boy would recognize a fight he couldn't win.‚Äù I looked over to catch a glimpse at Lucia who looked confused and then while looking directly at her I shouted, 



‚ÄúJust give them the hourglass and they will let Carla go.‚Äù I saw recognition in her eyes and she was onboard with the gambit. These were Becket‚Äôs men; they did not know that the Borrowed Time had already been used and that the hourglass was empty now. Whatever bizarre energy it had contained was currently sustaining the life of Lucia‚Äôs sister. 



Lucia raised her hands up and I went to join her. We slowly walked up the stairs and the guards had their weapons trained on us. Lucia stared daggers at the big man and told him, 



‚ÄúThe hourglass is inside; it‚Äôs in the red suitcase. Now let her go.‚Äù The man chuckled and he motioned for one of his cronies to go in and verify. He emerged a moment later holding the ornate hourglass. He handed it to his boss and the big man rolled it over in his hands. He looked back to us and then grunted and let his grip on Carla loosen enough for the little girl to escape and run toward Lucia. He looked back at us and said, 



‚ÄúWell, a deal is a deal, Mr. Becket will be thrilled. We did not even need to deal with that weird old bastard Salazar. No, not when we ended up getting a better deal from his associates. That‚Äôs right, the Hourglass for letting the girl go, a deal is a deal.‚Äù We were about to turn and walk way when he spoke again, 



‚ÄúBut....some deals leave loose ends. I did not say anything about tidying up loose ends. We don‚Äôt want Salazar sniffing around. As far as he knows you lot still have it, it would sure be convenient if you all died and his Borrowed Time just vanished. It seems like if we let you go you might be forced to tell him who had it, so.....you know, loose ends.‚Äù He nodded to his men as he turned and started walking away down the opposite staircase. The men pointed their weapons at us and I thought we were dead. Lucia was holding her sister and she was crying. I did not know what I could do. Suddenly I heard a muffled click and the tell tale sound of a subsonic crack cutting through the air. The two men aiming their weapons at us had small holes in their heads that jetted blood out onto the cheap patio railing.  



I screamed at Lucia to get down, but to my horror I saw she was already laying on the ground, a bleeding wound now blossoming on her shoulder where she had been shot as well. She covered Carla with her body and the poor girl was still screaming, even as Lucia slowly tried to drag them both out of the line of fire. 



I dove toward the slain men as I heard more muffled shots rake the stairwell, aiming for the large man now evidently. Somehow, he evaded them and I heard angry cursing as the big man tried to return fire to wherever the shooter was located. Whoever it was, they were not on his side or ours. 



I grabbed the sub machine gun that the dead guard had been carrying and I shoved both bodies together to create some makeshift cover out of their bodies. I heard gunfire from the stairwell and more cursing. While the unknown assailant was firing at the other man, I crawled over to Lucia and tried to help her move. I managed to grab ahold of her and she held onto her sister as we crawled on and through the door to their room. We just made it inside when a large arm seized the door right as I tried to close it. 



The door was thrown open and I saw Becket‚Äôs man, he was wounded but still alive and he charged forward knocking me off my feet. I dropped the sub machine gun I had recovered and it fell from my hands and outside the room right where the patio was being raked with gunfire. I took a step back but saw that the big man had lost his gun as well. He took a step inside and closed the door behind him, the sound of gunfire pinging off the nearby walls. He glared at us and shouted, 



‚ÄúCall off your man or I swear I will break your necks before he can save you.‚Äù I stood up promptly and got in between the deranged bastard and Lucia and her sister. I gestured down to Lucia and told him, 



‚ÄúOpen your eyes, he shot at us too! Whoever that is, he is not with us and you might want to get down. I ducked and the door was perforated with several more precise shots. The large man fell to his side and landed hard, breaking a nearby coffee table. 



I looked down at him and said, 



‚ÄúIf we want to get out of this we will have to work together. We wait for him to come to us, he will likely try to get in. He knows we are in here and that someone might have alerted the police and should be arriving to help at some point. He will have to make a move.‚Äù The large man winced at the mention of police but relented and shrugged his shoulders and spoke, 



‚ÄúAlright little collector, we will do it your way, just understand I am keeping the hourglass, whatever happens. Now what should we do when he gets here?‚Äù I looked over to Lucia and told her to get back and take Carla in the bathroom and lock the door. She nodded her head and started to respond, but I held up my hand as I heard a gentle creaking and the front door began to open. Next was a small clinking sound and I saw a curious little red orb on the ground. It looked strangely familiar and when I remembered where I had seen them before my heart sank. I shouted out, 



‚ÄúNo time!‚Äù And I kicked  Becket‚Äôs guard in the back of his knee and he fell forward onto his face and on top of the red orb. I dove toward the bathroom where Lucia and Carla had moved. I landed hard and heard a loud vacuum-like sound behind me. I looked back and I was shocked by the sight. Before our eyes the man had simply imploded in on himself. A shriveled sac of bloody gore was all that was left of his hulking frame. I spared the time to chuckle morbidly at the fate of Becket‚Äôs right hand man and how even though he did not steal directly from Salazar's business the same thing had happened to him. 

I guess there really was one that would implode a person. When I considered the weapon that had been deployed I realized the gravity of the danger we were still in. Only one person would have those sorts of tools. Salazar had sent someone after us. I was terrified of what else they might have brought, either tools I knew about, or horrifying new ones. Before I could rise to my feet a slender figure emerged through the doorway, they wore a strange mask and carried a large pistol and a strange looking knife. I heard a distorted voice call out, 



‚ÄúYou must be Henry, I heard a lot about you. It is a pleasure to meet you, you did some good work from what I heard. I guess I am your replacement, names Gideon. So, I won‚Äôt insult your intelligence by entertaining any other notions about what is going to happen here, the secretaries gotta die man, you know that. But Mr. Salazar said that he would be willing to spare you and your kid if you cooperate and don‚Äôt get in the way. There's still a chance to turn back, just walk away and let me handle this.‚Äù  



I slowly stood up and looked at the man, I had to think or something but I needed time. I tried to get him talking, 



‚ÄúWhy kill Becket‚Äôs men? They were about to do your job for you.‚Äù The man, Gideon as he said his name was chuckled and cocked his head slightly in what was likely a bemused expression under his mask and responded, 



‚ÄúYeah, that would have been awesome, but Becket and his guys did not have the full picture. The hourglass is useless when that kido has the time. Pretty sure we have to put it back in the hourglass. Could not have him shooting her in the head. I don‚Äôt think that stuff makes you bullet proof and I did not want to risk losing it. Plus, Becket tried to cheat Mr. Salazar, they had a deal beforehand and he tried to cut us out. I didn't even know they would be here, but once Salazar finds out, he might have to add some extra strings to the contract if that dinosaur Becket still wants his time after trying to screw us.‚Äù I nodded my head and tried to keep him talking but he cut me off and stated plainly, 



‚ÄúNo time for chit chat, what's it gonna be Henry? I really gotta go, I don‚Äôt want to have to start killing cops, but I mean you have seen the sort of crazy shit he gives us, if I have to I have to. It is just easier to keep a low profile ya know?‚Äù 



I made my decision. I looked back to Lucia and took a step forward with my hands up. I walked toward Gideon and stood next to him with my arms still up and I responded, 



‚ÄúIf it will save my daughter, I have no choice.‚Äù I saw the color drain from Lucia‚Äôs face and Carla started crying again. The pain of betrayal on her face was unbearable and for a moment I thought I would not be able to hold my composure. 



Gideon chuckled and said, 



‚ÄúGood choice man, I knew you were the real deal. No need to die for some worker bee, not when ladies like her are a dime a dozen when you get the kind of cash you get from this gig. Anyway, time to say goodnight little lady, nothing personnel.‚Äù He aimed the gun at Lucia and I shouted out,  



‚ÄúWait, I have one last thing to say to her, please.‚Äù He held the gun up and Lucia glared at me, obviously not wanting to hear a word from me. I crossed my fingers and hoped this would work. I spoke again and uttered a single word, 



‚ÄúEvernight‚Äù In an instant all the light in the room was sucked into Gideon's bag and the room went pitch black, I only had a few moments and I hoped he would not fire a shot while still aiming at Lucia and her sister. I shifted my weight forward and executed a hard pushing kick. I stuck home and I heard Gideon cry out in pain and confusion. The unnatural darkness swallowed the flash of the firearm, but I heard the reports of several shots ringing out. I heard a clatter on the floor and I tried to follow the sound as best I could. I felt the nearby armchair and jumped onto it. There were more shots and I swear I felt one graze past my foot. I followed the sound and leaped off the chair and fell down, leading with my arm in a makeshift elbow drop on his hopefully still prone form.  



I heard another cry of pain as my elbow connected with what felt like his sternum. I tried to reach up and grab for his arms, which might still be holding his weapons. It was my turn to cry out as I felt the bite of the knife digging into my side. I painfully pulled free and I dropped to my back to avoid what I guessed where several follow up stabs directed at where I had been. I had been trying to count the time since activation and I knew I had a few more seconds until the blackout was over. I had to disarm him by then or he would shoot us all. I heard another gunshot and heard something shatter in the bathroom. 



Just another moment and the light would come back, I jumped to my feet and charged toward where I had heard the shot. I had to get this right. The light came back and Gideon saw me. He tried to level the gun at me, but I jumped and threw my weight at him in a desperate dropkick. My weight sent him flying toward the open door. He was reeling and tried to recover near the railing outside the room. I saw that he was too far away when I got back to my feet and I knew I had miscalculated. He got back to his feet and once again took aim at me, I thought it was over, until I heard several shots from behind. Salazar‚Äôs new collector looked down at the multiples wounds on his chest and let out a pained gasp as he toppled over the railing and into the pool just as I had fallen into earlier. Something told me he would not be climbing out. 



I looked behind and saw Lucia, her own gun still smoking. She was panting and still bleeding bad from the wound on her shoulder but when she saw me smiling at her she moved up to me and slapped me in the face. I was confused and then she said, 



‚ÄúThat is for scaring my sister.‚Äù As I reeled from the blow with a pained and confused grunt, she pulled me in and kissed me. When she pulled away, she was smiling and before I could respond she said, 



‚ÄúThat is for saving both of us.‚Äù I smiled back and thanked her for saving me as well. The relief faded from her face and she winced in pain, as the adrenaline wore off and she was reminded of the fact she had been shot. I helped her sit down and got a first aid kit from the car and helped her dress the wound. Fortunately it had gone clean in and out, but it was still bad. She would need to see a doctor, but it would work for now. I took the small packet of burn ointment in the kit and applied it on a hilariously small portion of the awful burns I had across my body. The bleeding stab wound was patched up as best I could as well. I also taped my hands up so that it would not hurt so much to grasp things. I felt like complete hell but I was alive.



Carla was still hiding in the bathroom, she refused to come out. I knew the poor thing was likely traumatized by all the events she just had to witness. Lucia eventually got her to come out and tried to comfort her and I sat down next to them, completely exhausted. My mind was racing and I had to think of something we could do. I knew what was likely the only option I had left and it terrified me just thinking about it. After a few minutes I came to a grim acceptance of the truth and felt emboldened by the desperate realization that if this did not work, we would all be dead.  I had no idea how I would do it, but I had no other option. The only way to stop this once and for all would be to take out Salazar. If I stopped him, Sara would be safe, Lucia and her sister would be safe, we all would be. 



I stood up and spoke to them both,  



‚ÄúWe have to get out of here. The police will get here eventually and there is a lot more to explain here than I think we can. Worse still, Salazar is going to send someone else eventually. You two need to get somewhere safe, I need to get back to the office.‚Äù Lucia looked confused and upset by my declaration. She said, 



‚ÄúWhy in the world would you go back there?‚Äù 



I smiled and replied, 



‚ÄúTo tell the boss that he can‚Äôt fire me, I quit.‚Äù  ",2,1734910244.0,u_BadandyTheRed,1,1.0,False

1hkamio,https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1hkamio/frustrations_today_even_after_update/,Frustrations today even after update,"I'm not going to lie, the new update is amazing. The agent appears way better and it was powering through my requests today until it didn't. Trying to do a react frontend where it populates an agent page to register new agents. Got that mostly working with the backend to generate claim codes and store them in the database. 

My issue is the pop-up dialog. It's logic should be that the pop-up has a toggle to set the agent claim as multi-use if enabled or single use if not. Then a button to generate the code. The code gets generated from the backend and it's displayed but the toggle is still there. The toggle at this point doesn't change anything with the code but in the UI it tells the user that it's either set to multi-use or single-use. I can't get cursor to fix it. Basically gives the user the inclination that the coffee can still be changed.

I've tried letting it know the concern from a user stand point that they would think it's being changed on the backend and it makes some changes and says that it's fixed that the toggle will be read only and can't be used after the code is generated. But it's still there. 

I tried explaining the process that I would like to see in detail and the flow. I also say that I would just like the toggle to be hidden once the code is generated. This way it won't confuse a user as it has no function once the code is generated. It makes some more changes and says that should be fixed. It didn't... So I figured hmm I might be caching something, so I shutdown the frontend and restart it, I also deleted browser data and it's still there. 

So on to my next one, I try to say let's split the messages and explain that the first message is up through the generate and then the second one will show just the code. So it makes the changes and we go back and forth because it's still somehow doing the same thing. So I reverted the code to using one dialog and asked it to make it conditional. It does and it still does the same thing it's looked at states and says everything is working correctly when it's not. 

Yes, I fully know that I can review and fix the code myself to make it do what I want but my goal of this project is to see how far I can push the AI and it's done great with way worse prompting and harder code requirements. Yet this simple react pop-up is stumbling it. 

In addition, at two points I took a screenshot of what I was seeing and highlighted the issue and it mentioned that it made my dialog look exactly as I showed it... When I asked it to remove the boxed in toggle.

I also tried opening a new composer agent for a fresh start and it still failed. Anyone have anything I can do to prompt it better? I will admit, I'm not a great programmer but find it crazy how well it does on somethings and then how bad it handles others. I've probably burned about 40 or 50 credits trying to fix this one component today. ",1,1734910037.0,cursor,2,1.0,False
1hkamdp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hkamdp,Furniture/room layout ideas? No kids. Mid 30s couple: love movie nights/ board games ,"Hi we're buying our first home and hoping to get some inspiration for what kind of furniture to put where. We don't really need a formal dining area and the space behind the counter seems too small for a table anyways. I need that window for my 30 plants as well.

Hoping to come up with something for the ""family room"" space for conversation/board games that is casual enough to hang and chat but also on another night play games without leaning over a low coffee table and hurting our backs , also no ""bar height"" (getting older is fun).

As far as the ""living room"" was thinking of an L shape couch but it would block the bay sitting window (which is fine) both my partner and I would like a couch shape that could accommodate both of us laying down for movies if we wanted. Comfort is most important. 

The carpet is going to be replaced with tile that looks like walnut plank, most likely, possibly in a herringbone pattern, but not sure.

New appliances in kitchen as well (not sure what colors yet), but keeping the cabinets and counters until we can afford a remodel. I hate the chandelier and florescent light in kitchen, would love to remove/replace.

I love art deco.

Any advice welcomed, I have no idea what I'm doing!",1,1734910025.0,interiordecorating,1,1.0,False

1hkajw0,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1hkajw0/i_finally_found_out_why_hes_been_flirting_for/,I finally found out why he's been flirting for months without actually taking it further. It's not what you think. At all.,"I've been posting here for a few months about this person, who I seem to have a rare connection with, who says I'm a beautiful and attractive woman, but won't take it further than friendship. I've been deleting some of my posts. This one will be deleted too in a week.

He said to me once, ""*I'd kiss you but won't start something I can't finish*"". Some of you thought he was commitment-phobic and maybe a bit of an a-hole. I too started suspecting he's enjoying the attention, but isn't interested in me specifically. It was affecting my self esteem and body image. One time I got drunk enough that I tried to hint at it myself; and got shot down.

We spent most of the day together. Had coffee in the morning. Had a walk along the beach till noon. Had dinner at a restaurant, and then went to see a live band playing at a local venue.

During the day, we ran into several friends, who kept asking us ""*how long have you been seeing each other*"", and ""*how did you meet""* etc. Questions you typically ask couples. He's been touching me all night (gently).

Eventually, one of the musicians at the pub - a mutual friend who's often a bit drunk at this time of the evening - approached us and said, **""*****for f\*\*k's sake you two, stop with the lovey-dovey stuff and get a room already""*****.** When he drove me home later, he fessed up: these people don't know he's completely unable to perform, in the physical sense. I was too shocked to respond and ask further questions, I wish I did - but I wanted to respect his privacy. **All this time I thought it was about me. I didn't realize he's physically incapable of sex.**

I should have guessed. I know some of his medical history. He's also older than me. And it's something guys are usually very self-conscious about and can't reveal. It's probably more common than we know - for medical or psychological reasons. Some people have been consuming extreme porn long enough that they can't even get aroused enough for regular sex. Some anti-depressants have a side effect of sexual dysfunction and low libido. Drug use in the past can lead to this. Certain types of cancer, blood pressure issues, lots of things, not all of which can be addressed with a little blue pill.

I want you to think about that when you're dealing with men who don't seem to initiate any romance with you. You can't really know what's going on in another person's life. **It's not always about you**. Don't let your self esteem be affected by a rejection.

I'm not happy to find out. But I'm certainly relieved. I've been wondering for so long. I finally know the answer.",32,1734909804.0,limerence,5,1.0,False

1hkaitw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1hkaitw/how_i_conquered_my_crippling_anxiety_in_60_days/,How I conquered my crippling anxiety in 60 days,"I‚Äôve been dealing with various levels of anxiety for at least the past 6 years without ever being able to discover the root cause or know what to actually do.

After a long period of resorting to drugs (nicotine, cannabis, some alcohol) and even fast food, I took one good look in the mirror and hated what I saw. In hindsight maybe it was depersonalization but I genuinely felt like I could not recognize the person I saw in the mirror.

I really let myself go.. red eyes, wrinkles forming, my gut was larger than normal, the whole nine yards. From that point I was so ashamed.

Didn‚Äôt want to leave my house, didn‚Äôt want to catch up with old friends and family, life really lost purpose and I lost the spark in my eyes.

I refused to take any medication without at least trying to give some effort naturally to fixing all this and even reversing the effects of all the drugs and poor diet I‚Äôve accumulated over the years.

Long story short, it worked. Despite it being a long path, at the end of the tunnel I was cured of my anxiety.

Now I feel a lot more confident in my body, I can approach strangers with ease, I can travel the world without feeling self-conscious, and most importantly, I‚Äôve brought back life to my years.

This may not work for everyone and this isn‚Äôt for anyone who is only going to give it 50% effort. This was pretty much a full time job for me but the results were well worth it.¬†

**Here is the step-by-step NUCLEAR blueprint that turned my life around:**

**1. Come to terms with reality**

Being in denial makes this entire journey a lot harder. It‚Äôs alright, it happens to everyone. You don‚Äôt need to feel ashamed that you‚Äôre anxious. Look into reading A Guide to Rational Living by Albert Ellis.

**2. What could go wrong?**

Seriously. Just ask yourself this and really get to the fundamentals. What‚Äôs the worst that‚Äôs going to happen? Who cares if they say no? Or if things don‚Äôt work out? Almost all of the time, you‚Äôll realize that in the grand scheme of things, you‚Äôll be fine and you‚Äôll still be breathing. Which brings me to my next point.

**3. Focus on breathing**

Breathing is a really important factor in making sure your body stays calm. This was something I learned from years of swimming. Sometimes the difference between a good swimmer and a great one is just the way they breathe. Look into Wim Hof breathing techniques.

**4. Keep your body moving**

Movement is crucial to the function of your body. Sometimes anxiety is just pent up adrenaline and can be released by regular exercise. Your body will also release endorphins post-workout which can help accelerate feelings of calm.

**5. Your gut is your second brain**

What you eat plays a large role in how you feel. Stop eating shitty food and focus on nutritional foods instead.

**6. Fix your physical environment**

If you‚Äôre living under a staircase with no light, guess what? Your anxiety is not going to improve. This one is often a lot easier said than done. Sure, not everyone can easily move out their environment. But there are ways to optimize the environment you‚Äôre in now. Declutter everything, get organized, open your windows.

**7. Prioritize good sleep**

Turn off any blue light/phone an hour before bed. Don‚Äôt eat heavy meals before sleeping. Take a shower and do some light stretching. Sleep is when your brain recovers and is so important in how your brain ends up dealing with anxiety.

**8. Cut down on caffeine**¬†

I‚Äôll admit, this one is hard. But believe me, your body does not need 300mg of caffeine everyday. It‚Äôll suck at first, but cutting down to 1 coffee a day is most likely all you really need. Or better yet, try green tea/yerba mate instead.

**9. Journalling**¬†

Write everything down. Every emotion you‚Äôre feeling, every little thing that‚Äôs bothering you, every thing that makes you smile. Writing helps clear the mind of any racing thoughts.

**10. Supplementation**

Skip the large stack and having to take 20+ different pills every day. Ashwagandha, taurine, and l-theanine are all you need. These are well-researched, safe supplements with supporting evidence to aid in anxiety relief.

And that‚Äôs all!¬†

I find that a lot of this just comes from momentum. Try to find an accountability partner to help you get through the first week or two with all this and you‚Äôll soon find that the 2 months will fly by.

Have faith, there‚Äôs a more relaxed, calmer, and confident you on the other side!",0,1734909711.0,Anxiety,0,0.5,False

The Coffee Chronicler posted a positive review of their 64mm burrs, but that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean the 78mm burrs will be better. He actually prefers their 64mm ‚ÄúSweet‚Äù burrs over their 83mm ‚ÄúSweet‚Äù burrs. They don‚Äôt have a ‚ÄúFilter‚Äù version of the 83mm burrs (not yet anyway), but he said he often preferred the LeBrew 64mm Filter burrs more than Timemore 78mm Turbo burrs and more than the 64mm SSP MP and SSP Brew Burrs (SSP Brew burrs = Unimodal V1 burrs, which were a pre-cursor to the MP / Unimodel V2 burrs). He describes the LeBrew as a ‚Äúmiddle ground‚Äù and ‚Äúbalance‚Äù between these two extremes of SSP Brew and 78 Turbo. https://coffeechronicler.com/lebrew-hyperburrs/

LeBrew‚Äôs marketing is information pretty bad, although it is better than SSP. All of their coffee burrs are called ‚ÄúHyperBurrs‚Äù, then they have versions ‚ÄúLeBrew Sweet‚Äù, ‚ÄúFilter‚Äù, and ‚ÄúEspresso‚Äù in different sizes. Like SSP‚Äôs burrs, these are start as copies of other burrs, but produce different results.

LeBrew is not a company, but actually a brand name used by a Chinese company called Dongguan Finishline Precision Electromechanical Co., Ltd. It has no relation to anything in France, despite the French name.",3,1734909500.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

I love Christmas. Love how positive the vibes are during this time of year. Just cause I like Christmas doesn‚Äôt mean I always like the execution of it. I‚Äôve always wanted to have that stereotypical Christmas, but god damn, that‚Äôs too much fucking money for a damn holiday. Most I‚Äôll do is the presents, only thing that really matters when it comes to the money aspect.

Even though, it‚Äôs a wonderful time of the year. I‚Äôm also much more depressive as well. Might be a combination of the weather, being cooped up inside all day. I guess it doesn‚Äôt help that I‚Äôve been feeling lonely lately. You know, I really thought you could be happy by yourself. But that‚Äôs just a fucking lie that humanity made up at some point. 

How can we possibly be happy alone when we‚Äôre social creatures? 

I haven‚Äôt really been motivated to do much either. I think I might need a higher dose on my ADHD meds. I‚Äôm just hoping it‚Äôs mainly due to this time of year. Or I‚Äôm just pushing myself too much maybe. I feel like I got to be productive every second, shit, I guess the ADHD meds really are working to an extent if that‚Äôs how I‚Äôm thinking of time now. Maybe I should start drinking coffee again.

I haven‚Äôt really wrote, I only really feel more inclined to write when I think it‚Äôs something worth writing about. I‚Äôm just limiting myself when I think like that though. Working against myself, one of the things I‚Äôm best at. It doesn‚Äôt help that I have these short bursts of motivation either. Why can‚Äôt it just be permanent? I hate that I get burnt out fast, need to do something about that. Where can you even start when it comes to fixing that shit‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt think a self help book could help with that. 

Even though, I‚Äôve been having all those issues. I‚Äôve been pretty happy at the same time. Just been happy with my weight loss journey. I spent a day the last month just going through my clothes that won‚Äôt fit me anymore so I could donate it. I‚Äôm gonna have to do that again with how baggy my fucking pants are now. I have to tie the laces tight to the point that it got the pants scrunching up. 

Had to throw away some clothes too since they were too worn to give away, I only had them still to use as pajamas. Like I had this Morrissey shirt I bought not even two years ago, I looked ridiculous in it once I tried it on the other day. I looked like a girl wearing her boyfriend‚Äôs shirt after last night.

I already know that some of my favorite clothes won‚Äôt be fitting me soon at this rate. So, I‚Äôm definitely going to be sad about that. Plus I‚Äôm going to have to go shopping soon to buy some new clothes. I can actually try out new styles without being worried if I could pull it off now. Hardly got any self esteem issues now. My confidence has gone up quite a bit, but I‚Äôm going to keep myself in check. 

I used to have this big ego, a defense mechanism. Never really made sense though because I didn‚Äôt exactly have much to back it up with lmao. Don‚Äôt want to be repeating that era of my life.

I‚Äôm mostly ready for Christmas. Already got the TV for my dad and his partner. Got this Barbie for my sister, but I‚Äôm giving my mom some money to buy her some other shit later on. I‚Äôd get her more presents but damn, we spoil her too much. I was going to get my mom these boots, but they won‚Äôt even be delivered in time, so she‚Äôll get that soon. I‚Äôm not even sure what I‚Äôm getting my brother, I‚Äôll just give him some cash. Shit, maybe I‚Äôll actually buy him some fucking actual work shoes for work. Dude has been wearing these pair of black Nikes for months now. I‚Äôm impressed his ass hasn‚Äôt slipped yet at work. 

**Song Of The Day**: [Smino - Kushmas](https://youtu.be/AUhuwQ6Yc_0?si=GjzgZFNE8uTAPpJF)

Fucking love this song, always listen to it during this time of year. Shit, I even listen to it when it isn‚Äôt even December. This song hits harder when high.

Hi there.
 I‚Äôm currently waiting to get some health insurance set up to finally see a doctor and I‚Äôm waiting in a lot of pain. I‚Äôd love to have a dad figure to call often and hopefully befriend. I deal with a lot of depression and anxiety and take medications for it. I also walk, listen to music, color, clean, do yoga and meditate to manage. However sometimes when you‚Äôre in a lot of pain, you just sit still. 

When I‚Äôm more lively I enjoy reality tv shows, going out to coffee shops, and going to the gym. 

Wanted someone I could listen to on the phone. You can be from anywhere message me your ASL

I would appreciate feedback, but also perhaps a story of your own?","I'm not usually this proud of my writing but WOW, I really cooked here I think... Let me know what ya'll think!

I was stumped.

Growing up poor, I had romanticized and coveted the precious *laptop* for countless years. Innumerable videos with scary stories found online, discord shenanigan compilations, informal essays, and the hottest indie games had all led me to believe that computer screens held the internet in its superior form. Finally, after damn near a decade of yearning, one was sitting right in front of me‚Ä¶ and I had absolutely zero clue what to do with it. As you‚Äôll soon see, I doubt I was a minority in experiencing this.

If you ask anyone why social media addicts find it so hard to use anything outside of their little solar system of applications, chances are they‚Äôll reply that it‚Äôs because they have no attention span. True enough. Being able to pay attention for longer than sixty seconds certainly helps. However, I don‚Äôt actually think that was my issue here. I remember the night like it was yesterday: I had a dangerously high dosage of Vyvanse in my system, a cup of coffee on my nightstand and several hours of free time on the clock. I was *more* than ready to pay attention. In hindsight, what my issue was is something I feel most people either don‚Äôt consider or don‚Äôt consciously form into words: **The level of control we are conditioned to having on the internet fundamentally builds our relationship with it.** The individual who is addicted to social media algorithms and short-form content is conditioned to a completely effortless internet, where the all-mighty algorithm serves them up a never ending stream of information wrapped in delightfully stimulating sights, sounds, and colors. It keeps them engaged because it knows exactly what they want to see‚Ä¶ but do they really *want* what it has for them?¬†

Picture this: Imagine you're at work and you‚Äôre just *starving,* but sadly you‚Äôve got nothing to eat. What food are you daydreaming of sinking your teeth into at that moment? Is it‚Ä¶ a bologna sandwich? Maybe. Maybe not. But if your co-worker suddenly comes up and says:¬†

‚ÄúHey, I thought I was hungry but I just lost my appetite for some reason‚Ä¶ You want this bologna sandwich?‚Äù

Unless you‚Äôre particularly uncaring for bologna, I bet you‚Äôd gladly eat it, and maybe even enjoy it! But that doesn‚Äôt automatically mean you *wanted* a bologna sandwich. You ate it because it was *there*. You ate it because it was *given* to you.

Likewise, one of the larger but less widely discussed motivators to watch short form content is simply because it‚Äôs *there.* I mean, it‚Äôs only, what, thirty seconds? Why *not* watch it? *Why not?* Why *not* eat the bologna sandwich? But, dear reader, imagine that one hobby you absolutely *adore* for just a moment. You do it because you can think of a thousand reasons why you want to, should, and will, *not* because you can‚Äôt think of any reason *not* to. When was the last time you thought to yourself ‚ÄúBoy oh boy! I sure can‚Äôt wait to scroll on TikTok for a few hours! That vegan mushroom lady has the *wackiest* recipes! I mean, she made a mushroom taste like *steak!* Incredible! And those Fortnite clips, good GOD those Fortnite clips! They have my jaw on the floor every time! I would *kill* to hit those kinds of shots!‚Äù I sound ridiculous do I not? Who, other than a child, would be so passionate about something as frivolous as short form content? But if drifting through the TikToks or Reels or Shorts or whatever the hell is so effortless and stimulating, well, why *not* do it?

When you‚Äôre zoned out on these apps, the algorithm is your caregiver; While it‚Äôs busy preparing each and every second of video for you, knowing exactly what you like, or rather, what you don‚Äôt mind, you‚Äôre reduced to a helpless little baby who needs to do not one thing but simply drink from whatever bottle you‚Äôre served. And occasionally shit yourself. Now, a *good* caregiver will nurture us into something bigger and better, teaching us to be independent and intelligent. But the *infantilizer* holds covertly sinister intentions, keeping us weak, ignorant, and dependent by freeing us of the burden of working and learning. In the same way that the infantilizers' abuse is often misinterpreted as love, the algorithm's infantilization is often misinterpreted as a benefit to us\*.\* In fact, in the realm of the internet, the algorithm might just be the most brilliant infantilizer there ever was and ever will be.

If we‚Äôre conditioned to having each and every second of content served to us on a silver platter, what exactly will we do when *we* must serve *ourselves*? What *do* we want to see? What *do* we like? What *are* our interests exactly? What *are* we curious about? We *think* we‚Äôre interested in what our algorithm cooks up for us, but how much of it actually sticks with us once we put the phone down? Well, assuming you *do* put the phone down every now and then‚Ä¶ The scroller is so conditioned to being without control, that once they *do* have it‚Ä¶ they simply don‚Äôt know what to do with it. Similarly, if you throw a child, or even worse because no one will take care of them, a successfully infantilized adult into the real world, what on earth are they supposed to do? They‚Äôre dependent! They can‚Äôt take care of themselves!

A fundamental difference between the passively entertained consumer and the actively engaged consumer is that the active consumer consumes with *purpose* and *intent,* while the passive consumer will simply gobble up whatever random slop happens to be plopped onto their plate. On the internet, do you conduct yourself like a *child* or like an *adult*? The child takes. The adult earns. The child is given. The adult is rewarded. It‚Äôs *astonishing* how many strong, intelligent, and independant adults spend their days working themselves near to death to build their lives and reach their dreams, only to pull out their phones and regress to the mentality of a child who whines when their mashed potatoes get mixed with their mac and cheese. And boy, do they get irritated when their internet *dares* to lag behind! ‚ÄúMOMMYYY! I WANT DINNER **NOW!** I SAID **NOWW!**‚Äù

Ask yourself, when you use the internet, how dependent are *you* on outside forces of curation? Can you easily think of countless subjects and websites you‚Äôd type into a search bar? Or are you *lost* without the guiding hands of trending tabs, for you pages, and retweets made by followed accounts? **You get what you put in.** The more reliant you are on the algorithm to create your internet experience, the less rewarding it will be. After all, if you hardly play any part in it, what exactly makes it *your* experience? You only have so much time left, so why not use that time to consume like an artist, an intellectual, and with dignity and purpose? Of course, a successfully brainwashed social media addict, lacking in self-respect and integrity, will happily disregard this, *assuming* they were able to get through it at all. ‚ÄúWhat does it matter if all I consume is slop? Using the internet is supposed to be as effortless as drinking out of a bottle, and mindlessly stimulating like having keys jingled in my face! Why bother putting effort into making it worthwhile? **It‚Äôs not like I spend a lot of time on it or anything.**‚Äù¬†

Do keep in mind, each and every piece of information your brain takes in will inevitably fall into the dark, mysterious sea of your subconscious. Do you want yours to be a pristine ocean, home to a diverse ecosystem of astute wisdoms and meaningful memories? Or are you content with it being a blackened landfill, poisoned and polluted with waste insignificant to anyone other than the ecosystem that can‚Äôt thrive as a result of it? Because if so, then *please,* don‚Äôt let me or anyone else stop you from scrolling your life away, and the slop you endlessly consume on the internet will leak into your life outside of it one way or another. Just remember that no matter how *too far gone* you may feel, they‚Äôre the very same ecosystem and they share the very same potential. On the other hand, if you‚Äôre like me, and you want the internet to be a meaningful and mendful force for your mind rather than a way to shut it off; If you want the internet to be a powerful addition to your life rather than a cheap, addictive escape from it, then remember:

**Be an independent internet user.**

**Don‚Äôt rely on outside forces to make your experience.**

**Be your own curator.**¬†

If you can be your own man in the real world, why not do so in the virtual world as well?

And that's it! My writing style is heavily inspired by Dale Carnegie, and this is only my second draft because I would like to include several real stories to illustrate my point the way he does! If you feel that this essay has taught you something or given you a new perspective, and you know of an instance that demonstrates this shift in control, I would greatly appreciate it if you either left it in the comments or dm'd it to me if it's too personal to air out in front of everyone. Of course, you'll be credited however you please. 

To be specific: Can you think of an occasion where you tried to engage in any activity outside the jurisdiction of algorithms where you struggled to make meaningful progress or do anything at all, that you now realize was a result of the lack of outside curation? Maybe something the algorithm led you to believe you would enjoy doing but then you felt lost when you tried doing it for yourself? For example, let's say you really enjoy short text stories read to you by a voice and aided by stock footage, but if you try to read all on your own it's quite difficult? Does that make sense?

We both live in British Columbia, Canada. It's been planned that we're grabbing a coffee at a good place, then going to a walk with her dog around the ""candy cane lane"" in our town.

1hkabk5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticAdults/comments/1hkabk5/seeking_help_with_how_to_appropriately_handle/,Seeking help with how to appropriately handle boundaries with high functioning autistic adult,"Hello!

I'm going to spill my brain out here for a sec. I will keep it as brief as I can, and thank you for reading!

I have been attending a recovery group through my church every week for that past 8 months. There is a high functioning autistic adult there with whom I am not sure how to set proper boundaries. The issue that I have is that he is very attached to me (and no one else, just me) and it has gotten to the point that it is negatively affecting my experience in the program. I can be a very friendly and inviting person, and I wonder if he has mistaken that kindness for a deeper friendship.

Here are some scattered details that I think might help paint a good picture of how things are going:

\- He has my number and has texted me about the issues that I attend the group for  
\- He has referred to me as his friends on numerous occasions, which isn't untrue, but I believe the term ""friend"" carries more weight for him than it does for me  
\- At one point I did agree to grab a coffee with him and it went fine  
\- Every group meeting, he makes sure to save me a seat (such that it would be rude of me to go sit somewhere else, as he is quickly pulling out a chair for me to sit next to him)  
\- When we meet for small groups at the second half of the meeting, he will wait for me to sit so that he can find a seat next to me  
\- Last week after large group (first half of meeting) he again waited for me to start walking to small group so that he could walk and talk with me. I made a pivot to the bathroom and then he just followed me in there. He left the bathroom before me, I noted ""see ya down there"" to help him know that he doesn't need to wait for me, and then when I got out he was indeed waiting for me again  
\- When small groups wrap up, he always waits for me so that we can walk back upstairs together

Overall, I feel uneasy going to the group because I know that these things will be happening. I don't mind him as a person, I don't think he is doing anything intentionally wrong, I don't think he even realizes that he is suffocating me. I feel like I can't relax when I'm at the group because he is always hovering around me. It is difficult to get into conversations with other people because he is always right there grabbing my attention, and every once in a while butting into a conversation. This all also happens at church.

It is now to the point that something needs to change. I have mentioned this to the leadership team, which does not have much experience in this specific area. They said they will talk with some people who have more experience and get back to me. They also were curious to see what people say here on Reddit, as I informed them that I would be making this post.

Does anyone have any advice on how to make this situation better? All of the social cues I have given, things I have said to help steer him in a direction, have not been picked up on at all. I think I need to be more direct, I'm just not sure how. We will be starting a more intensive part of the program in a few weeks and my intention is to resolve this before then.

My 8 week old which I got on saturday is doing really well. As I type this I am in my bedroom WFH and she is alone in the loungeroom play pen having a nap, which is nice that she already is okay to some degree being alone. Last time she cried out I took her outside and she did a pee and poop then back into the pen where she resumed napping.  
  
So far she is peeing and pooping outside, not in her crate and not in playpen basically ever. She had two pee accidents where I stopped on the way to the backyard to grab treats and try make a quick coffee, but otherwise she's great.

Only real questions I have are -

She is more or less completely unphased by praise/ high pitch, and I take high value treats for after toilet but she is mostly uninterested. If she is peeing and pooping outside, then this isn't really an issue right? Just keep trying to praise/ reward.

Other question is she ignores my voice most of the time. I thought she was deaf, but she's definitely not. I suppose she's young and eating my garden is more interesting than listening to me, but I assume I just continue to say her name and engage/stimulate as normal?

Much smaller problems than everyone here haha so i'm blessed, for now!

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it‚Äôs you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength‚ÄîI wish I‚Äôd had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There‚Äôs so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it‚Äôs not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian‚Äîyour mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she‚Äôs gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I‚Äôve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I‚Äôm certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup‚Äôs rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn‚Äôt know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you‚Äôll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I‚Äôm deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea‚Äôs trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, ‚ÄúW-what does this mean?‚Äù

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. ‚ÄúNot here, not now. Let‚Äôs get home, then we can talk.‚Äù

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother‚Äôs shrill voice called after them, ‚ÄúLeaving already? You haven‚Äôt stayed for lunch.‚Äù

Sorin‚Äôs jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.‚Äù With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. ‚ÄúDamn it, damn it, damn it.‚Äù

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea‚Äôs gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

‚ÄúD-do you‚Ä¶ think this could really be true?‚Äù Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. ‚ÄúLook, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might‚Äôve signed, we‚Äôll have proof.‚Äù He paused, deep in thought. ‚ÄúDad must have something lying around.‚Äù A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. ‚ÄúWhy did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could‚Äôve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!‚Äù

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. ‚ÄúWe‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt really know what was going on back then‚Ä¶‚Äù

A sob erupted from him. ‚ÄúI loved him so much, Drea. I don‚Äôt remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end‚Ä¶‚Äù

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another‚Äôs embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, ‚ÄúCall Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.‚Äù

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn‚Äôt rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it! That woman is going to pay today. I‚Äôve tolerated her long enough!‚Äù He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

‚ÄúAdrian, no!‚Äù

So, I did something today that I've been dying to do for a while, and let me tell you, it was amazing. For the first time ever, I went out in public in feminine attire during the day. Until now, I‚Äôve only ventured out at night or in more private settings‚Äîso this was a huge leap for me.

I drove 2.5 hours from San Jose to Guerneville, a little LGBT-friendly gem in Northern California, and wow, the excitement started the minute I hit the road. Navigating through San Francisco traffic, I noticed people staring at me‚Äîmen, women, everyone‚Äîand I‚Äôm not going to lie: it was embarrassing and arousing at the same time. It‚Äôs hard to describe the feeling, but imagine being the center of attention and loving it. Every glance felt like a delicious little rush.

On my way, I stopped for gas, grabbed a coffee, and used the restroom. The lady at the station was super sweet and even gave me a compliment on my outfit‚Äîhonestly, I couldn‚Äôt stop smiling. I was already feeling more confident, and it just added to the thrill.

Once I got to Guerneville, I parked, touched up my makeup, fixed my hair, and applied some lipstick. I was nervous at first to step out of the car, but I could already feel the excitement building. After a few deep breaths, I finally got out and walked down the Main Street. I felt so feminine, so desired‚Äîand I absolutely loved it. I picked up a couple of lacy panties (because, why not treat myself?) and had a blast taking some photos and videos to remember the moment.

It was a mix of liberating, exciting, and arousing all rolled into one. There‚Äôs something so thrilling about stepping out and feeling like the world is noticing you, maybe even in ways you don‚Äôt expect. I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about how good it felt to be seen for who I really am.

Anyone else had a similar experience? Any tips on how to keep pushing these boundaries and embracing this side of myself even more? I‚Äôm hungry for more experiences like this and can‚Äôt wait to see where it leads.",3,1734908051.0,CrossdressingStories,1,1.0,False

There were about 10g left so I did a 17:1 ratio and it came out wonderfully. I was confused on the first sip because it was so floral and tea like I thought I had just brewed a delicious cup of white tea, but it finished with a very mellow coffee flavor. I am sad that there was not enough for me to play with but still really enjoyed it.",7,1734907993.0,pourover,3,1.0,False
