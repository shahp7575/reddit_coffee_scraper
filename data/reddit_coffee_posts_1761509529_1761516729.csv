I‚Äôve been interested in penpaling ever since I was a kid. The vastness of regional differences that history and media introduced me to swept me away, making me endlessly fascinated in the many things this world seemed to have out there to be discovered and experienced. That was back in the days before you could more easily meet someone from halfway across the world sooner than a neighbor a few doors down. Since then, I‚Äôve been fortunate enough to have people to exchange with, and I‚Äôd like to see if I can find that again.

I‚Äôm looking for someone that I first and foremost have a connection with. I want to actually get to know my penpal. Location doesn‚Äôt matter as much, as who that person is defines whether I‚Äôd like to engage with them or not. I do have a preference for cultural exchange in which we can be introduced to different and new things. But, whether you‚Äôre my state or half the world away, it‚Äôs you, the person, I want to exchange with.

I'm interested in both a physical exchange, with my preference being letters and items, and a digital e-mail exchange. Due to the private nature of penpalling, however, I want us to actually chat a bit and get to know each other before diving right into those physical aspects of it. Let‚Äôs become familiar with each other to make sure we‚Äôre a good fit. I'm open to an e-mail exchange more readily.

So, who am I exactly? And who are you?

I'm 35, male, and live in the US (ET time zone). Thoroughly introverted, but bold and open when the mood strikes and with those who can tap into that aspect of me. I‚Äôm designed for the slow burn and deliberation of written conversation, hence the lure of elongated methods of communication.

Incremental exchange and a mutual creation is what I default to, but I've gone to the ends of the earth on a whim with the right person before. I adore abstract minds that get idiosyncrasy and whimsy. Compatibility is a strange thing, though, that feels most real when it‚Äôs too fluid to be defined. I sort of have a thing for making connections work that otherwise shouldn't.

Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine. I‚Äôm an autodidact who‚Äôs been passionate about a variety of persuasions since I‚Äôve been young. I‚Äôm most infatuated with the nature and function of reality, and particularly human perception. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that a lack of limitation is highly limiting.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also adore writing conversationally, from mundane chats to lengthy letters, often permeated with a dim poetic glow. Photography also has a hold on me, and I hope to do more than just dabble in it.

I like burning incense, time pieces, archiving and organization, collecting, and coffee. I‚Äôm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies. I so probably have more I take for granted.

I used the worst coffee I could find (the only one available actually), a dark roast nondescript industrial pre ground ‚Äûfilter‚Äú coffee, 6 weeks off-roast, wich I then re-ground (yes that works) in my less-than-perfect P2 to fill up the pico. No dialling in, no scale, no timer, pressure gauge, paper filter or pre heating were involved in the process. All more or less eyeballed. Only upgrade to the stock pico were IMS basket and WDT tool. 

And the result: less than perfect indeed. A little too thin, quite pronounced bitter notes. But full bodied, with enough crema and a nice enough texture to impress any Italian in the room. Not the specialty crowd of course, but it was drinkable, enjoyable, qualified as espresso and was better than what I‚Äôm being served in 90% of non 3rd wave cafes. And brewed while going 100 mph. I call success.

1ogxaqs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ogxaqs,Would love suggestions for dealing with wrinkles/skin.,"I have never really taken care of my skin, but I am becoming a little too selfconcious about the state of it - particularly the lines between my eyebrows. I am not contracting my muscles in the pictures (at least I am not trying to) but I think I have a very strong tendency to, especially when I am studying/reading/looking on my computer.

I have recently looked into the subject and started drinking collagen powder in my coffee in the morning. I am considering using retinol/tretinoin and even considered botox, because I hear that of course prevents my muscles from contracting, but that it could also weaken them and perhaps teach me to not use them too much afterwards as well.   
And of course will be using more sunscreen in the future!

Would you recommend me doing things like that, or can you see that those solutions would not really help me?

1ogx90c,https://www.reddit.com/r/WHENetwork/comments/1ogx90c/rogue_wedding_suppliers/,Rogue Wedding Suppliers,"# A Cautionary Tale for Couples and Creatives

In the world of weddings where every moment is meant to shimmer with meaning, there‚Äôs a growing shadow that‚Äôs dimming the light for too many couples: the rogue supplier.  


Over the past few months, I and many fellow suppliers have noticed a troubling trend. Social media is flooded with heartbreaking posts from couples let down at the last minute. Photographers who ghost. DJs who vanish. Decor companies that promise the moon and deliver dust.  
  
These aren‚Äôt just logistical hiccups, they‚Äôre emotional gut-punches on what should be the most joyful day of someone‚Äôs life.  


When Trust Breaks, Magic Cracks

A wedding isn‚Äôt just an event. It‚Äôs a tapestry of trust. Every supplier whether magician, florist, planner, or caterer is a thread in that weave. When one thread snaps, the whole fabric suffers.  


For couples, the impact is devastating:  


* Sleepless nights wondering if the supplier will show.
* Scrambling for replacements days before the ceremony.
* Emotional fallout that lingers long after the confetti settles.  

For genuine suppliers, it‚Äôs infuriating. We pour our hearts into creating unforgettable experiences. Rogue operators not only hurt couples they erode trust in the entire industry.  


# The Lure of the Cheap Price

Let‚Äôs talk about the elephant in the room... PRICE.  


In a world of rising costs and endless Pinterest boards, it‚Äôs tempting to chase the cheapest quote. But here‚Äôs the truth cheap can be costly.

Rogue suppliers often bait couples with bargain prices, only to disappear when it matters most. That ‚Äútoo good to be true‚Äù deal? It often is. Because behind every lowball quote, there‚Äôs usually:  


* No contingency plan.
* No emotional investment.
* No accountability.
* Waiting for the next booking to charge more and cancell you  

Weddings aren‚Äôt just transactions they‚Äôre transformations.

You‚Äôre not buying a service. You‚Äôre investing in a moment that will live in hearts forever. And that moment deserves suppliers who are emotionally present, professionally prepared, and passionately committed.  


# Red Flags to Watch For

If you're planning a wedding, here are some signs that a supplier might not be as reliable as they seem:  


* Vague contracts or no paperwork at all.
* Poor communication or long response times.
* Overpromising without clear deliverables.
* No verifiable reviews or portfolio.
* Pressure tactics or last-minute payment demands.  

# What Couples Deserve

You deserve suppliers who:  


* Show up with integrity, not just talent.
* Communicate clearly and consistently.
* Care about your emotional journey, not just the transaction.
* Collaborate with other vendors to create seamless magic.  

# A Call to the Industry

To my fellow suppliers. let‚Äôs raise the bar. Let‚Äôs be the kind of professionals who restore trust, not erode it. Let‚Äôs call out bad practice not with drama, but with dignity. Let‚Äôs support couples with transparency, empathy, and excellence.  
  
And to couples, ask questions. Read reviews. Meet supplier for Coffee (We love to hear about your plans) Trust your gut.  
  
The right supplier isn‚Äôt just skilled they‚Äôre emotionally invested in your joy.

Just today I found schematics for two different automatic water collectors, the powered pump and water purifier. I already had a generator and powered them up. I read around online that it takes an in game day to produce water and that it should show up in your workshop but nothing is happening. Even if i go up to the pump to try and manually collect water my character says ""everything's working just fine"", no water. Ive waited 3 days in game time and still nothing, do i need settlers or something? I was so excited to have a fresh water source but im losing my mind over this.

1ogx6ci,https://www.reddit.com/r/tylertx/comments/1ogx6ci/opening_a_lounge_in_tyler/,Opening a lounge in Tyler,"We‚Äôve noticed, like a lot of you have mentioned on Reddit, Facebook, and all the local groups, over the years, that there really isn‚Äôt a good spot around here for young professionals, or honestly, anyone who just wants a nice, laid-back place to hang out and connect.

We‚Äôve got restaurants with bars and clubs, sure, but what we don‚Äôt have is a cozy lounge where you can just relax, have a good drink, cocktail, listen to some live music, and actually have a conversation without shouting over a dance floor. Basically, a spot that‚Äôs a little more about mingling and a little less about just eating or clubbing.

So that‚Äôs the plan: I and my business partner are looking to open up a lounge right here in town that fits that vibe. During the day,  during the day, this spot is going to be a perfect place to get some work done, do a bit of reading, or maybe join a book club meet-up. We‚Äôll serve coffee and have a little game area where you can just relax and play something casual. Then as evening rolls in, we‚Äôll switch gears into the lounge mode with liquor, cocktails, mocktails, and a cozy vibe for hanging out.

If that sounds like something Tyler needs, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts or any ideas you have to make it even better. We‚Äôre also open to constructive feedback. Thanks. ",6,1761515778.0,tylertx,0,1.0,False

But I want to get the general consensus on the situation.

My friend and I attended a Halloween parade hosted by our barn, and due to lack of planning and preparation on my part, I ended up just going to target the night before and getting a cheap sheet to poke eye holes in. My horse and I each had a sheet so we were both ghosts. Which I thought was pretty cute, and seemed to be a hit at the parade. 

My friend and I decided afterwards to ride our horses into town to get coffee. She had a whole different costume on, and I ended up taking the sheet off my horse (it kept falling over her eyes, and I thought it smart to not blind my horse while riding in traffic) but I was still in ghost costume. 

All was well until the tail end of our ride, when a black lady (race relevant to the story) pulled up in her van and said, ‚ÄúIs that the KKK?!‚Äù We didn‚Äôt hear her right at first so she repeated, and my friend replied, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a ghost?!?‚Äù

The lady insisted, ‚ÄúNo, that‚Äôs the KKK.‚Äù She laughed, claimed she was going to ‚Äòmake me famous,‚Äô and then flipped us off as she drove around the corner. 

I‚Äôm definitely not racist. At no point did I consider the potential ties, so maybe I‚Äôm dumb at worst. But I‚Äôm just wondering - is wearing a sheet ghost costume wrong? Now that someone has pointed this out, if I wear it again on actual Halloween, would that make me TA? I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôve stepped onto the wrong side of a sensitive issue or if I‚Äôve just found one person who is particularly bothered by things. 

I‚Äôd like to add that there was NO pointy hat involved. In fact I put my helmet on over the top of the costume so my head was very round. ",3,1761515762.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

Some context: We are a British couple (39F, 40M) and this was our first cruise, so we cannot compare to other lines or even other VV ships.¬† We have however been on multiple all-inclusive holidays to high-end resorts across Europe, Mexico and the Caribbean, so are not totally unfamiliar with this style of holiday.¬† 

I‚Äôve never been much of a reddit user, but found myself lurking in this subreddit often prior to the voyage, and so registered for an account so I could follow the sub.  This is my first reddit post, but keen to pay back all the insight I've gained, so here we are! 

**BOOKING**

We booked direct with VV, drawn to the adults-only, modern vibe (we wanted to avoid formal, traditional lines). We originally hoped for the NY‚ÄìQuebec route but this itinerary worked better ‚Äî and it fell over our anniversary. We booked the LIR Sea Terrace.

**CABIN**

Having booked the LIR rate, we were somewhat nervous about cabin allocation, and bid on a couple of RS upgrades.¬† However, we were allocated a Central Sea Terrace on deck 8, which we were super happy with, and opted to withdraw our bids.

* **Size** ‚Äì Felt pretty spot on.¬† Of course, extra space is always nice, but it never felt like we didn‚Äôt have enough space.
* **Storage** ‚Äì Saw some complaints on this, but we were away for 18-nights so had a fair bit of luggage, and we had no issues. ¬†Storage included lots of hanging space, drawers and shelf storage.¬† Our medium-sized suitcases fit beneath the bed easily.¬† I‚Äôd have liked a bit more storage in the bathroom but that‚Äôs being picky!
* **Bed** ‚Äì Nice and spacious! Having read negative comments on the firmness, we were worried about this.¬† I‚Äôm a fussy sleeper but while the bed is on the firmer side, we found it comfortable.
* **Air conditioning** ‚Äì Very efficient but would‚Äôve liked the option to turn it off (not sure if we missed it) as at night I could feel it blowing on me at times, which I didn‚Äôt like, but managed to adjust the temp/sheets to cope!
* **Noise** ‚Äì Being on deck 8, we did hear the late night music in On the Rocks in our cabin, often very clearly.¬† We had ear plugs with us so it wasn‚Äôt a huge problem, but next time round, if we could choose our cabin, we‚Äôd aim for a higher deck.

**SHIP**

We loved exploring the ship ‚Äì beautifully designed, with every space serving a clear purpose and its own vibe. We spent very little time in our cabin because the ship was so enjoyable.

**FOOD**

Overall, we thought the food was fantastic.¬† Sure, some things were better than others, but the quality and standard was pretty high, and not far off some of the best resorts we have stayed in.¬† Specific reviews below.

* **The Galley** ‚Äì Reliable and great variety.¬† We particularly enjoyed the tacos and chicken quesadilla special, the burger, and the omelettes.¬† The cooked breakfast was decent but would‚Äôve prefer pork sausages over the strange chicken & apple option (but recognise the desire to be more inclusive!).¬† The desserts were good ‚Äì in particular, the hazelnut rocher was fantastic.¬† We were always happy to come here over the course of the trip, and never felt like we‚Äôd run out of options.
* **Rojo by Razzle Dazzle** ‚Äì Visited 2 times.¬† Probably my favourite restaurant option.¬† I loved the tapas style food, particularly the ham croquettes and the oxtail crostini.¬† Was sad we couldn‚Äôt get in a third time!¬† The Basque cheesecake was probably my favourite dessert of the entire trip.
* **The Wake** ‚Äì Visited 3 times.¬† The food was good and cooked perfectly (we ate steak, chicken, dorade).¬† I found the menu to be less interesting/inventive than others, and would probably not visit as often next time.¬† Great dessert selection though!
* **Pink Agave** ‚Äì Visited 2 times.¬† Our favourite steak was from here (preferred it to The Wake) and also loved the corn.¬† Didn‚Äôt rate the vegan main option.¬† Enjoyed the variety of small, medium and large plates.¬†
* **Extra Virgin** ‚Äì Visited 1 time.¬† The bread here was amazing (much better than the bread in The Wake imo!).¬† The rest of it was pretty good but nothing exceptional.¬† Would happily eat here again but didn‚Äôt feel like we missed out only visiting once.
* **Test Kitchen/Gunbae** ‚Äì Didn‚Äôt try either as not to our tastes.
* **Pizza Place** ‚Äì Was pretty good and reliable ‚Äì we had pizza 3 or 4 times in total.¬† I think one time it was a little underdone for our tastes but each other time it was pretty spot on.
* **Dock House** ‚Äì We did the mezze option one afternoon and found this to be a nice change from some of the heavier/more indulgent options.¬†
* **Social Club** ‚Äì The snacks here were great (esp. peanut brittle!).¬† The hot food (hotdogs & wings) was probably our least favourite food on board but as it felt fairly average.

**GUESTS/ATMOSPHERE**

We‚Äôd read mixed reviews of the NYC‚ÄìQuebec voyage, citing not just an older crowd but also somewhat ruder, so we were a bit nervous. The demographic was definitely older (I heard average age \~63) ‚Äì it was quite funny at times trying to navigate around the ship, getting stuck behind slow mobility scooters and zimmer frames (it felt almost like a sitcom).¬† The demographic also influenced some of the entertainment choices on board (see Other Entertainment below).

However, we met such a wide range of people of all ages (24 up to at least 60s) and everyone was so kind, friendly and personable.¬† We did hear a few complainers around the ship but nothing more than you‚Äôd expect for any holiday.¬† The guests we‚Äôd met who were previous VV cruisers did say the vibe was very different and the younger guests particularly seemed to feel some pain from the changes VV made to accommodate the older crowd, but for us, we were very happy to mix it up between partying and chilling out!

**SHOWS**

The Virgin shows were one of the parts we were most excited about prior to boarding.¬† Reviews of long queues put a bit of a dampener on this ahead of boarding.

We decided that despite how much we wanted to see certain shows, we wouldn‚Äôt spend ages queuing, and would arrive at most 15 mins before entry.¬† I wasn‚Äôt paying super close attention but I think generally queues were starting around 45 ‚Äì 60 minutes beforehand with a decent sized queue forming 30 mins prior to entry.

With this approach, we saw every show we wanted to see.¬† I think all but maybe 2 shows we just walked into, so you definitely shouldn‚Äôt feel the need to queue, although we often opted for the later slots which may have helped (given the demographic point noted above).¬† That said, VV really do need to come up with a better system, as there isn‚Äôt really the space for queues and they did somewhat get in the way in the casino and On the Rocks.

The performers were also universally fantastic, but the actual show quality (writing, production) was very mixed and we found some of the non-Virgin original shows (e.g. magicians, etc.) to be a bit Vegas-y for our tastes.

The other thing I didn‚Äôt like was the blatant use of AI in the show production, and I mean, *blatant*.¬† I am not against adoption of AI in the right circumstances but in Red Hot and Murder in the Manor it was painfully obvious to the point of distraction.

Some specific show reviews:

* **Up With A Twist:** $50 show including dinner and drinks.¬† We really enjoyed the show.¬† The food was probably the best we ate the entire cruise.¬† The cocktails were strong and while not all to our taste (we hate coffee), it was fantastic value.
* **Murder in the Manor:** This was the show we were most looking forward to before we even heard the positive reviews. We knew it would be popular, especially as the mid-cruise shows were cancelled due to illness.¬† It was therefore only on 3 times in total, so I was concerned about being able to get in, and we decided to break our ‚Äúrule‚Äù and queue about 30 mins before start time.¬† They started letting people in earlier than usual which helped and we got great seats upstairs.¬† However, the show itself I was a bit disappointed in, it really wasn‚Äôt that great and fairly predictable in its plot.¬† I thought it was just OK and husband hated it.¬† So, a mixed experience!
* **Out of Time:** ¬†An absolute shambles, honestly.¬† It felt like they chose which songs they wanted in it and then tried to crowbar a story (and a weak one, at that) around it.¬† Needs a serious re-write if it‚Äôs to stay on the rota.
* **Red Hot:** ¬†We saw the dress rehearsal.¬† We loved this show (despite the evident AI imagery), mainly because it was a jukebox musical where they didn‚Äôt try to overdo the story.¬† It did feel a little bit like an OTT love letter to Richard Branson, which could be toned down, but the feel good vibes and song choices made this the most fun show we attended.
* **Tom Crosbie:** Not a Virgin show but this was the best non-Virgin show we saw by far.¬† Smart, funny, unique ‚Äì if you like that sort of thing, and see him on your schedule, this is a must see.

**OTHER ENTERTAINMENT**

The other activities we enjoyed included the trivia quizzes, as we found these a great way to meet other people.¬† The quiz quality is quite mixed and could do with some finessing (wonder if AI wrote these as some of the Qs were very weak!).¬† However this worked in our favour as we were quite successful in winning some of the quizzes!

The night-time entertainment was pretty good although was, I suspect, adapted to the demographic.¬† The music being played was mostly 70s and 80s and the late night events were often closed down early (we heard there‚Äôd been noise complaints).¬† The shame was that most people in the nightclub were younger (20s-40s) but they wouldn‚Äôt play more modern music, which made it less enjoyable than it could‚Äôve been.

We did the following paid activities:

* **Suitcase of Secrets ($50):** We‚Äôve done a lot of escape rooms (130+) so were excited to see this on the schedule.¬† You get put into a team of up to 6.¬† It was pretty fun but tough even as a relative ‚Äúexpert‚Äù and I think needs simplifying a bit for the audience on a cruise.
* **Let‚Äôs Get Choco-Lit ($35):** We mainly booked this as it was on our wedding anniversary.¬† It was fine but essentially just mixing pre-made chocolate with ingredients, and you couldn‚Äôt take it away with you (but could eat it there).¬† Wouldn‚Äôt do again or recommend.
* **Slots/Blackjack Tournaments ($25 each):** Good fun ‚Äì mainly luck driven rather than skill. ¬†Would possibly do again.
* **G0ld Rush Gamble ($50):** This was pretty poor, taking the theme too literally.¬† Would be much more fun if it was more general knowledge.¬† Would not recommend, but if you do sign up, read up on the g0ld rush (Klondike and California) before you participate!  (Reddit won't let me use the word g0ld for some reason?!)

**STAFF & SERVICE**

The staff were almost universally incredible.¬† Almost everyone we came across were super-efficient, customer-focused, and helpful and friendly.¬† No one was actively bad, but some of course stood out.

* **Happenings Cast** ‚Äì I don‚Äôt understand how they do what they do!¬† Working long hours, very active roles, always needing to be upbeat and positive.¬† A truly impressive bunch!
* **Wait Staff** ‚Äì Excellent service everywhere. Shout outs to Anderson (Pink Agave) and Bogi (Extra Virgin).
* **Bar Staff** ‚Äì All good, but particularly Luca at the Social Club who made amazing floats and had great film knowledge that he definitely didn‚Äôt share with us during any film quizzes‚Ä¶!
* **Housekeeping** ‚Äì Never seem to stop! Always there with a smile on their face.¬† We didn‚Äôt have the room serviced every day but whenever we did it was done to perfection and promptly.¬† Fantastic all around!
* **Other:** Very impressed with how they dealt with the change when we couldn't visited Eastport - it was only a few hours for them to confirm that we had an extra day in Boston.  It was a shame not to visit Eastport but they navigated the situation perfectly in the circumstances.

**So, overall review, we absolutely LOVED our first cruise and Virgin Voyage and we cannot wait to book our next one‚Ä¶ #RollOn2026!**

**----------**

***TLDR:***

* ***Cabin:*** *Booked LIR and lucked out with a central sea terrace on deck 8.¬† Cabin was comfortable and well designed, with good storage and comfortable bed.¬† Only issue was the noise from One the Rocks, would book a higher deck next time.*
* ***Food:*** *Excellent overall ‚Äì stand outs were Rojo and Pink Agave.¬† Enjoyed the flexibility of the pizza and The Galley, both of which were great.*
* ***Guests/Atmosphere:*** *Older crowd than expected but friendly and fun, with a relaxed, social vibe.*
* ***Shows:*** *Mixed experience.¬† The best shows were Up With A Twist and Red Hot.¬† The other Virgin shows we saw were all skips due to poor writing and production.¬† AI use was very blatant and poorly done, which was a bit disappointing.*
* ***Other Entertainment:*** *Trivia and activities were fun, though music skewed older and some events ended early.*
* ***Staff & Service:*** *Exceptional crew throughout ‚Äì friendly, professional, and consistently attentive.*
* ***Final Thoughts:*** *Loved it.¬† Would absolutely sail Virgin Voyages again ‚Äì already planning our next trip!*",10,1761515721.0,VirginVoyages,2,1.0,False

Hi to the Reddit Tarot Community.

I am new to Reddit, it was by chance that I had already been joined with them, which was over a year ago now. A couple of weeks ago (at this time) I had been randomly sent an email from Reddit, updating me on their news. And as I had just recently closed my Tarot Shop and account with Etsy, (you are welcomed to read the post discussing further on the topic that I had written up, on my re-introduction to Reddit). I feel like a door (Etsy) has closed, but a window (Reddit) has potentially opened for me. I am hoping that that this timing of synchronicity may allow for wonderful possibility's, and allow to compliment myself too as an Amateur Tarot Card Reader. And also to compliment yourself, as a person who may be intrigued as to how my own personality can influence a Tarot Reading for you.

I am passionate about Tarot, and I have always been spell-bound by the Tarot's Mysterious ways. Over the latter years I had begun to study Tarot myself. Although I thought it would be quite easy, but the transition for me to becoming a Tarot reader has been long, slow and at times even arduous. Sometimes it feels, just as I think that I am on the right track, I find that there is another Tarot corner to turn or Tarot challenges to face. I guess that I am creating my own Tarot boundaries.

And although this has been a very slow and progressive journey for me, I am still as enthralled by the Magic of Tarot and it's story-telling as if it was the first time I got a Reading done for myself all of those years ago now.

What I would like to offer, is ultimately 'a free reading', with the option, that if you like my words and find value in the time and effort that I will likely be writing into your description, that you are welcomed to contribute a small donation to me, via Pay Pal. I have the link up on the Social Site area of my profile. You don't even need a PayPal account to use this facility. A suggested recommendation for an amount, I would ask for the price of a Cup of Tea or Coffee that you can get for yourself at a Cafe.

So just to be straight with you, the Tarot reading is officially at no obligation or cost. But if you are delighted with the reading, on your own choice and discretion, you may leave a small tip for me, if that resonates with you.

I am only available to doing 1 reading at a time, and request a short space in between. I like to enjoy doing a reading for you, within my capacity. I don't want to feel like this is rushed or a chore for me at any time and want to remain receptive to the happiness I experience when writing out your words. This is long-term out-look, so if I did a Reading consistently, every several days or so, whether it be less or more, I would be over the moon. I would recommend that you keep an eye out for my availability sign at the start and the end of this post. You may also like to send me a Direct Message, and then I can let you know if I am available to give you a reading straight away, or if there will be a short wait (if there is somebody in front). Please try to save the Public Messaging area of this Post for Reviews only. Just DM me if you want to chat about anything or have a question. Please also allow a couple of days for contact and a response from me.

I request that you are 18+ to receive a reading from me and also that this reading is intended to being for entertainment purposes.

I ask that you tell me in Direct Messages, if you are a male or female (as preferred), an approximate age (ie, 40's). And if you want to, you may tell me if you have a partner or not. Please if you would give me the name that you would like to be referred to as.

At this particular time, this will be intended as a General Reading. So 'no questions will be required'. If you think that telling me a little bit more about yourself, or your situation at hand will help with the direction of a Reading, of course, in Direct Messages, you are welcomed to tell me a little bit more. This is optional. I request that you limit a General reading (from me) to once or twice a year, although if in the closer future you feel the urge to having a quick booster reading, or you have a specific question, or a short yes, no or maybe question, I may be able to offer you an alternative as I have several different Tarot and Oracle card decks.

I will seek to send you through a Picture of your Cards, if Reddit Messages allows for an Attachment or an Upload. If there is a word limit in Direct Messages, I will send your reading to you in multiple sections. (Please note that I am new to Reddit). I will try to check the Direct Messages every day or two, for the next 3 months or so and depending on the outlook, maybe weekly after that. I look forward to hearing from you. You can expect your Reading within 1 or 2 days from the time that I receive your contact. Although please allow for exceptional circumstances. If there is more than 1 person requesting a Reading, I will let you know how I'm travelling at the time.

...

As a return gesture from you that would be greatly appreciated, I request One of several options, which ever is of your favourite preference...

That you leave a Public review on the messages of this page for Reddit viewers to read. And that a review is given in a way, that if the tables were turned, and you were reading for me, a kind of review that you would want for yourself.

You are welcomed to privately offer me feedback for your Reading. I am seeking to grow and evolve all of the time, and your feedback is important for me. Please, I request that you only reveal what is comfortable for you. Perhaps a short paragraph to encapsulate how my reading resonated with you.

If you are a Card or Oracle reader yourself and wish to do a Reading Swap, I love getting readings done and will welcome this opportunity.

If you are short of money at this time, or just feel like having a free reading, don't worry, I know exactly what this is like and I completely understand. You are welcome regardless.

If you would like to leave a small donation, of course, only if you are happy with the words that you receive, I find that this will give me a booster. And although this is donation based only, and not an upfront fee that I'm requesting. I personally find that a small contribution inspires me to go on to the next reading for the next person. It is building for my confidence and validates some added inspiration for me as well as making my reading official. I am based in Australia and my PayPal link is: ... [https://paypal.me/loveofexpression?country.x=AU&locale.x=en\_AU](https://paypal.me/loveofexpression?country.x=AU&locale.x=en_AU)

May your generosity be returned to you in three-fold.

\- Would you like a Tarot Reading? I have room for 1 Tarot reading available now.

With Love and a Hug from Red Robin

1ogwzhj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Maxwell_Isekaied/comments/1ogwzhj/007_i967_the_open_road/,007: I-967 & The Open Road,"""Just in from the studio we have 'Burning Heart' by Survivor' a song from the amazing soundtrack of 'Rocky Four' coming to theaters November 27th."" The DJ said in a cool voice as a song that one day would become a classic started playing from the exceptional speakers in the ex-gangster's SUV. Max sang along to the music and banged his head as he pulled onto I-967 heading west. Traffic wasn't bad going West but the East bound lane was bumper to bumper. A few times he had to will away the wiki-powers as they tried to invade his vision. Telling him all about this hot-red hotrod or that burnt umber viper. 


He almost got in an accident when he spotted Stannely Lord's bright orange and yellow strech limousine, moving with traffic in the Eastbound lane. 


Name: Barbra 
Vehicle: Strech Limousine 
Owner: Stanely Lorde
First Appearance: Municiple Super Squad 01
Special Abilities: Built in defenses to assist in escape of opperator. 

Notable Events: Help Stanely Lorde evade capture by the Sinnisteros: MSS 03. Help Stanely Lorde evade capture by cyber cheetas: MSS 17. Was destroyed while helping Stanely Lorde escape the Municiple Super Squad: MSS 35 


The blare of a horn helped Max to focus on the road in front of him, being careful this time to not let his eyes wander too much. As he adjusted his position in traffic and started getting into the the zone. 

""now we have another one that is shortly becoming a classic 'Last Rights Loved to Death' by, Megadeath coming at you loud and strong. Here's to the sleepy heads out there. Turn it up and get the ""duck noise"" up!"" ""O ya! Now this is driving music."" max said to himself as the music carried him through the miles. 


The urban landscape filled with it's towers of glass. Shineing in the mourning light fell behind, As the sun rose. The towers became tall buildings and then merged into scattered homes and subburbs. The trees all shown in the red's yellows and oranges of fall. White whispey clouds spiraled and danced through the sky as Max jammed out to music and drove west.



The purple and gold SUV pulled off the interstate onto an exit that promised food and gas. The car needed a refill and the driver was running on fuems Max pulled into a drive through for a fastfood place he had remembered from the Mystry Comic Universe. An actual 'Quick and Easy Burger' franchise. He pulled up to the menue and ordered. ""I want a number three with everything, a large fry and a medium Coke."" a moment later a tired voice said ""It's breakfast hun order from the breakfast menu."" He looked at the dash and saw that it was a little after eight in the mourning. ""O then I will have a bacon egg and cheese biscuit with coffee and give me four hashbrowns."" He paused as his stomach gave out an almighty rumble. ""On second thought make that three sandwhiches as well."" 


""Alright hun, I got 3 Bacon egg and cheese biscuits with four hasbrowns and a large coffee. Anything else?"" ""Ya an orange juice."" ""Ok hun that brings your total to 6.72 cents. Please pull forward and pay at the window."" His heart stopped at the price and he smiled. The money in his pocket was going to take him alot further than he had originally estimated. He paid at the window to a tired but not depressed cashier before getting his big bag of delicious road food. He burnt his tongue on the coffee as he pulled across the street to the nearest gas station. ""sonofa!"" he yelled out in the car. Looking in the rearview mirror at Megan when he thought he heard a laugh, but she was still lying where Dr. Holtze and him had buckled her in at. Her hand had fallen and was resting on the florrboard below her. Max smiled at her sleeping form. So peaceful, then he got out of the car and started pumping. 


Inside the gasstation Max bought a Road Atles and some water bottles. He was happy when the cost of everything came to almost 20 bucks. He was really going to like living in this new time. Though he was a bigger fan of the 90's. He thanked the man behind the counter, then headed back to the SUV. For a moment he thought he saw movement in the vehicle but shrugged it off. 


Max took a few minutes going over the maps and sipping coffee before putting the vehicle in gear and heading out. Back to that west-bound lane. By the map he found that Municiple City was located at the border of Rhode Island and Connecticut, and the Conner's family lived in Nebraska near the boarder it shared with Colorado. ""Ok I think I can merge into I-90 here, then take it all the way to here. Where I will go south on I-29 until I-80. Where I will start going west again."" Max closed the map book and tossed it on the passenger seat next to his big bag of fried breakfast food.


He took another sip of coffee, glad it had cooled a bit more and merged back onto the interstate heading west. He had another few miles to go before he merged with I-90. Max reached over to the food bag and slipped his hand in finding it odd that the bag was open when he had sworn he had rolled the bag shut to keep the heat inside.



He shrugged off the thought and just took it as another sign that he was growing very tired. It had been a long night and now... Max's brow furrowed in concentration as his hand moved around inside the bag. His hand felt around counting only one Hashbrown and a single biscuit. ""What the hell? I thought this bag was full."" he muttered to himself and pulled out the hashbrown. He brought it to his mouth to take a bite when he noticed that someone had already bitten it. Looking in the rear-view mirror he didnt notice anything diffrent about the woman from Titania sleeping across the bench seat. His eyes squinted a bit, nope there was something diffrent. two of the seatbelts had been crisscrossed , as if someone had buckeld them in a rush. There was also the shine of grease on her hand and mouth. Max sighed, food thiefes he could never escape them in his past life and now, just when he thought he was in the clear. A food theif struck. 


Max laughed because that ment she was doing better and she had come out of that coma they had found her in. ""Now weve got something for all you still driving in this crazy world. This one goes to you on the traines weve got 'Crazy Train' by, Ozzy Osborne. "" Max bobbed his head as he shifted lanes and got comfy for the drive.",1,1761515299.0,Maxwell_Isekaied,0,1.0,False

1ogwxsa,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ogwxsa/ex_dumper_came_back_2_months_after_breakup/,Ex (dumper) came back 2 months after breakup begging me to come back and has continuously emphasized commitment and interest for the entire past year. It is now officially 1 year post breakup- how do I know if I should trust them/myself?,"As the title suggests, me (26M) and my ex (26F) broke up exactly a year ago this week. I would be lying if I said this entire year has been absolute torture internally for myself as I have been trying to learn how to give myself the love that I once poured into my ex. We had been dating for almost 3 years. The first 2 years were amazing, everyone, and I mean EVERYONE would comment on how they saw our love for each other, through words, actions, looks, commitment, communication, etc. I felt so safe and secure and seen by her. I never ever believed in or experienced the ""spark"", or ever let myself entertain the fantasies of marriage and kids until her. Obviously we had our disagreements and shortcomings, but it felt so constructive and safe with constantly showing up and adjusting how we showed up for each other. Ill add that we both suffer from mental illness like anxiety, depression, and ADHD. Our relationship started in college, I was out before her but I had to be a caregiver to my mother who was going through slow heart failure. I also was very overwhelmed starting law school and, while I finally sought medicinal support for my ADHD, the systems (or lack thereof) made the overwhelm feel impossible, even if the medicine helped in so many ways. I had an internship, part-time jobs, supporting family, trying to keep my grades afloat, and struggled to make alone time for myself, let alone my loving girlfriend. 

We would facetime every night, even the nights where I would get home late or was too stressed to talk, we would just enjoy each other's company. As long as we had each other, it felt like that was all that mattered. My mother eventually passed during the holiday season, the height of final exams. My professors were not very kind or understanding, nor were my part-time jobs that I needed to help with all the medical bills. I recognize during this time I felt like a shell of a human. I depended on my ex so much with how overwhelmed and heavy everything felt. I couldnt show up for her for months in the way i wanted to and how she needed me to, but she kept reassuring me that she was there for me, and I saw it in her actions and words. Fast forward a couple of months, new years comes and goes, my ex and I weren't able to be with each other for the holiday. She has since graduated and just moved in to a new apartment after landing her first big girl job. We both knew I did not have the means to move in with her yet, especially not before I graduated law school, but she was close to my school in distance and we were able to make it work with seeing each other minimum once a week. 

Before January ended, she told me that she was unhappy in the relationship for awhile now and felt like she had no chance to tell me with all of the crazy life events I was going through, but it was eating her up and she needed to get it out even if she knew I was in such emotional turmoil still. She then said she loved me, knew she wanted to marry me, but did not feel in love with me anymore with how long she had felt frustrated and unsatisfied for. She said she didn't want to break up and give up on us, but that she had a hard time managing her own anxieties and reminding herself of what we have, especially on the days between seeing each other (chalked it up to adhd object permanence at first). I was honestly completely crushed, but I understood what she was saying. I know how unhealthy this is now, but since she said she thought we could work through it together, I became so obsessed with addressing my shortcomings and work on things because I could not fathom losing her out of my own neglect. I had very little left in my tank, metaphorically speaking in terms of the general burnout i was experiencing, but i was giving her all that I had left, scraping the bottom of the barrell but wanting to prove my commitment and unconditional love for her. While the time management stuff felt impossible to address until I was finally out of school, I tried prioritizing showing up in other ways to be present with her. 

In the following months, we found ourselves stuck in this emotional cycle of me trying and trying and trying, me being excited to see her on the one day I could, but her either being dysregulated from work in the day to be too drained to engage with me, or struggling to get over her frustration with the loss of me all the other days of the week. Her once warm and loving eyes couldnt now look at me for too long without turning away. She was less affectionate, intimate, physical, in any sense. When i would point this out as a bid for connection or curiosity of how I can make the situation feel more safe or comfortable, she would cry, I would cry, she would say she doesnt know why or how to stop feeling the way she does, she would mention how she thiks we need to take a break, I would ask her to set the perameters of the break (i didnt believe in them but i would have for her), she would get overwhelmed because she didnt want to actually lose me, then the conversation would fade as we both were tired from emotional exhaustion. 

That went on for months. I eventually began vocalizing how dismissed I felt or emotionally neglected. I would bring up ways in which we could work on things together as a team, she kept saying she didnt know what to do, I would then be left feeling so confused and upset with the thought that I was being as vocal as I could be about the process of trial and error. I eventually graduated law school, studied and sat for the bar exam, passed (yay!), and then came the grind for job hunting. Summer came and went, I mainly spent it as a burnt out zombie finally allowing myself to grieve the loss of my mother and all the other things that I had to push to the side to survive. My ex and I were still shaky, but the cyclic emotional conversations were happening less and less, though we both were at a place where there was numbness, resentment, but still deep love for one another. I still felt like I had butterflies with her, i still felt so excited to see her, when I was with her I still felt like a giddy little kid who is having a sleepover with their best friend. Except, without the intimacy and sense of connection that she felt we lost. 

By this time last year, we tried having a couples getaway and booked an airbnb for the weekend. The weekend felt so freaking nice. So nice. Except, too nice. It was friendly, not romantic. When we tried having sex, we both started crying, except I was crying becasue I knew she was most probably thinking about still needing a break. She confirmed this, and we tried to again set the perameters which failed. The next few weeks after this weekend were so emotinally challenging as we both committed to attending family event after family event after family event in which made the unresolved tension within me feel so suffocating. I loved her so much, but I couldnt stop thinking about when she was going to do it. So, in the height of the holiday season, we had the most amazing date, the first date date we had in such a long time. It was crazy to feel so fucking happy and in love with someone but so, so fucking anxious and emotionally devistated at the same time. I didnt want to break up, but I felt like she wouldn't do it. 

We decided to go through with the break, to which we both did not adhere to the no contact, which then further extended the day we were supposed to come back to one another. When we eventually did, she said she thought we should remain seperated as she felt relieved to not have the crazy pressure we put on the relationship be present. I felt shattered. I wanted her to want me. I couldn't believe I wasn't worth fighting for. I couldnt believe she didn't see us as a team. She said she still wanted to marry me, but she was just so sad with how things had gone the entire year. 

2 months after breaking up, she reached out to wish me a happy birthday and to tell me that her childhood friend had passed away. We met up for coffee, it was weird at first, but familiar. I told her we wouldnt talk about the relationship, that i was there for her and the loss of her friend. Eventually she told me that the break/breakup was an absolute mistake, and she couldnt believe she ever thought that being apart from me, when all she wanted was time with me, was what she thought would work. She said all the right things man. She said everything that I wanted to see and hear for the entire last year. Except, i was so destroyed mentally and emotionally, I told her i needed time. I loved her so much, I abandoned myself completely in the process, and if I were to ever be with her or someone else in the future, I cannot go in to it without a level of self-love that i didnt even realize wasn't there to begin with. 

For this past entire year that we have been officially broken up, she has returned time and time again to beg for me back and tell me all the things and ways in which she will be different and better. She went on different medications, new friends, focused on herself and hobbies, etc. I spent this entire past year in the throws of emotional distress. I got myself a therapist to unpack not only the breakup, but the loss of my mother, and childhood traumas I was never really aware of as traumas as a child of immigrants. This whole year, I have felt like i have been emotionally torturing myself by not going back to her. I want her and miss her so freaking deeply. Yet, my body stops me from saying absolutely yes. I feel so stuck and paralyzed. I cant even find it in myself to hate her or be angry with her. I still love her immensely and the past year without her in my life, without her as my person, has been so insufferable. 

Even though I logically know the last year of our relationship, and this past year in this emotonal turmoil, is a sign in itself. I know i was rejected, i know i was trying, i know i was grieving and unwell. But yet, it feels like I'm the one holding myself back from the thing I so desperately have been wanting the most. I would be devistated still, but I feel like what has made this feel so worse is knowing she has been there relentlessly reminding me that she regrets it all. How do i know if i should continue standing my ground, or if I should give her another chance? How do i know if it is empty promises or if her coming back is a sign that things will be different? I miss her so much every day has felt like I have been dying so hard. ",2,1761515183.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1ogwx4p,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/1ogwx4p/fwb_has_feelings_for_me_afterone_week/,FWB has feelings for me after...one week?!,"Hi all, trans girl here.

A few months ago I made some new friends in my town - the three of us (me, bi trans girl - Tracy, cis lesbian - Adam, gay man) have been hanging out and I've really enjoyed having such queer and sexually open friends.

Tracy is amazingly charismatic and open, she always ""shoots her shot"" and she's candid about her high sex drive, her many flings and relationships, her poly experiences, and her involvment in the kink community. As a baby queer who is behind the curve in sexual experiences, I started just asking her one-on-one about her experiences, how she got into kink etc. She showed me her drawer of crazy gadgets and restraints and stuff. She offered to look into small wlw-only kink events we could attend together. 

This **Monday** (I'm writing this on Sunday in my timezone) she came over to talk more about kink and my lack of sexual confidence. One thing led to another and she 'demonstrated' some stuff and we ended up hooking up and she stayed the night. Then we went around hers on **Tuesday** morning and hooked up again. It was crazy hot and crazy validating and affirming and confidence-boosting. Apparently I'm really good at oral.  

What I most appreciated was the constant communication. I never felt I had to 'play the part' of someone sexual or seductive, I could just stop and ask weird, anayltical, unsexy questions (Yes, I'm also probably autistic, haven't been assessed professionally). 

I talked a lot afterwards about boundaries, about what this was, whether it was an ongoing FWB thing or just a one-off ""friend showing friend the ropes"" thing. She said it was probably a one-off thing. **Wednesday** evening she invites me over. I'm not dumb - I can tell she's horny and re-thinking it being a one-off. I'm happy with a FWB situation, but again I want to be as clear as possible about our boundaries. I don't have feelings for her - I suspect I may be aromantic but don't know how you ""prove"" it - I don't want to jepordise our platonic friendship, I don't want to make this weird for Adam, I don't want us to be couple-y, especially if it makes Adam feel like a third wheel. With these agreed, we hook up a third time. 

On **Thursday** all three of us hang out and we tell Adam. He's delighted and supportive. We hang out into the night. Tracy touches my leg at points and later holds my hand under a blanket. That felt a little too couple-y and like we're making Adam an unconsenting participant in a 'don't get caught' sexual thrill. I also avoid Tracy's eye during this as I don't want to amplify the sexual energy and neglect Adam. 

On **Friday** I am off work and Tracy is WFH. I invite her around for her lunch break to hook up, hoping that the time limit of her lunch will mean we don't end up spending the whole rest of the day together like we did Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. (My apartment is a state after a week of neglect and I had to call in sick to work on Thursday from being so tired!) Instead she brought her laptop to WFH at mine (I realise I didn't communicate my expectations clearly enough here). We hook up and afterwards I talk about further clarifying expectations, particularly my need to enforce 'end times' to when we hang out. I also explained my feelings about hand-holding on Thursday verging on inappropriate. She agrees and eventually leaves.

On **Saturday** we met up in town ahead of a planned afternoon with Adam. We end up grabbing some food and chatting, although as the meal goes on she gets hornier and flirtier. Perhaps against my better judgement it works on me and we go to a quiet thrift store nearby to make out in a changing room. At the time it felt like silly fun but in retrospect it feels disappointing we were unable to just have one-on-one time as friends without her getting very horny very quickly and derailing things. By her own admission she enjoys pushing boundaries and being a bit bratty/cheeky. I don't necessarily have a problem with this but I'm also now thinking that she's basically elected me, the inexperienced one of the two, as the Responsible One who has to always guard the boundaries of our relationship and say No. On one level I think it's good to get more comfortable saying no in sexual situations but, again, this is *day six* of a new FWB relationship with a much more experienced girl. It feels a bit precarious.

Now on **Sunday** morning she texts me wanting to meet up for coffee and catch up. I literally can't today I'm so busy, but also girl what do we have to catch up on? I've seen you every single day this week. She admits that she's caught feelings. It's not even been a full week! She seems to know this is absurd and also completely breaks all the agreements we made this week already. I said I can meet her next Wednesday to chat about it. Fortunately she is going on a 2-week holiday abroad next Friday which I'd already said would be a good chance for us to both reflect on what we really want out of this but now I also think it will be good for her to get some distance and cool off for a bit.

I already get the strong, *strong* sense that a FWB situation will not work, we will have to stop having sex and see less of each other one-on-one without Adam, and hope that we can get back some of our platonic openness going forward. I'm also frankly a bit annoyed this has all gone off the rails *this* quickly. I admired her so much for her confidence and forwardness but now I feel like I also see there is a lack of restraint and I feel like she's confusing lust and loneliness with romance? She's fallen for me in a *week*? I know she said I was good at oral but not *that* good surely?!

I feel like I know what I have to do, I'm mostly just annoyed this has happened this quickly. I had been looking forward to us exploring kink together and going to events and her chaperoning me into the world of casual sex.

So, I've been grinding away at this venture, and man, it's been this crazy rollercoaster. You know those late nights where you're staring at your screen, eyes burning, just praying that your coffee kicks in soon? That's been me for a while now. Savings are drained, pivots made, but every time I release a feature, it feels like I'm shouting into a void. It seems like no one's listening. Feedback is scarce, and sticky users are a distant dream.

It's hard not to wonder if this thing is nothing more than a shiny toy, not a real, sustainable business. I look at other founders who seem to ship faster, louder, and with so much more traction. It's like they're running the race and I'm tripping over my own feet just trying to catch up.

Despite the discouragement, there's this nagging feeling. Maybe it's belief, maybe just stubbornness, but it keeps whispering that there's still something here worth pushing for. I've even been considering automating more, especially after seeing what platforms like HypeCaster can do for video content and consistency, though not sure if that's the magic bullet.

My big dilemma now is whether to throw in the towel or dig deeper and push harder. Any of you faced this crossroad? How did you decide when to persevere or pivot? Any insights would be a massive help. Thanks, everyone.",1,1761514823.0,growmybusiness,0,1.0,False

Works Monday to Saturday. Sometimes he goes and does something work related on Sundays too. 
We have no village, no family to help me with two young kids and housework. I'll soon start working full time. Sometimes kids don't see him for a day or two even though he's home every night. It's not always work, he has friends, goes to football practice 2x per week, goes out for a drink, stays to watch the football game after the practice if there's a game that he wants to see (so he goes out in the morning around 7.30, comes home around midnight). So he has plenty of decompress time outside of home. I don't ask him to do stuff around the house anymore. Even though my ""work day"" at home starts at 7am and ends around 10-11pm, and rarely have time for myself, I feel that he's working hard enough and I'll deal with everything else at home. 

I'm concerned that he'll spend less and less time with the kids for one reason or another. I don't care about us hanging out, I'm more or less done with needing and wanting that. I actually look forward to not spending alone time with him anymore. I begged for that for years, and I'm over it. But I want to spend at least Sunday as a family, so that kids have a feeling that they have two parents. Just one day a week without him going ""just to quickly have a cup of coffee with a friend"" or whatever. 

Today he said he has to go out and give something to someone (work related), and after that he is quickly grabbing a cup of coffee with a friend. I blurted out something like 'Do you ever stop working', and asked if he can be with us just one day a week without him needing to go somewhere. He called me naggy. 

I'm done with asking for crumbs of his time. But at the same time, I want to do everything in my power that kids grow up having a feeling that they have two parents. That we spend quality time together.

""I'll be gentle. Just keep quiet. The tents are spaced far apart, they won't hear."" He twisted a finger through her hair, forehead to forehead, voice velvet. ""Sierra, give it to me, okay?""

Ethan was very skilled in bed; Sierra surrendered in minutes.

Warm fairy-lights ringed the tent. Ethan had even brought a star projector for romance.

Starlight poured over the tent as Ethan kissed Sierra passionately. The tent began to sway.

Sierra's pink bunny onesie ended up shredded.

When they were done, Ethan zipped back into his suit, cool as ever. He brushed a kiss over her eyelid. ""I'm out for a smoke. Stay put‚ÄîI'll carry you to the RV for a shower.""

Sierra felt both sweet and shy. He was always so gentle, even taking care of the cleanup afterward.

After Ethan left, Sierra received a WhatsApp message from a stranger: [Sierra, I have something important to tell you.]

Since the person knew her name, she opened the chat.

The next second, a photo popped up‚ÄîEthan's marriage certificate.

The woman's info was scribbled out. The date was six weeks ago.

The Quinn family had strict rules. They held a long-standing grudge against the Howard family. Generations had been at each other's throats.

Winona Quinn, Sierra's sister, hated Ethan. In business, they never gave an inch. In the past two years, their fight over the new energy market had been fierce‚Äîthey were true rivals.

Because of this, Sierra had never told her family that she'd been dating Ethan for two years.

Six weeks ago, her family gave her an ultimatum. If she didn't bring her boyfriend home, they would force her into a business marriage.

When Ethan heard that, he started planning their engagement party. He even said he'd make peace with Winona and propose at the Quinn residence.

Sierra didn't believe he would marry another woman that day. She got dressed and decided to go find him.

The night was thick and dark. Sierra saw a couple of red cigarette dots glow beside the RV. She walked toward them.

She heard one guy laugh. ""I clocked it‚Äîninety minutes straight. Tent almost came down. Ethan has been nailing her for two years and still acts starved. Did he really fall for her?""

Another voice snorted, ""What the hell are you talking about? Ethan got a vasectomy just to keep her hooked. She begged for his baby, so he had it reversed. Classic leash move.

""With his stamina, she's probably knocked up by now. But Ethan will keep pounding until nature handles the abortion‚Äîsaves him the clinic fee.""

Sierra's eyes widened. Her ears rang, and her heart felt ripped in half. Ice crawled through her veins.

She knew her family wouldn't allow her to marry Ethan. That was why she had begged Ethan for a baby‚Äîsure her family would cave once they knew. She thought a child would buy their blessing.

Sierra almost lost it and lunged forward.

Then more laughter rolled over.

""Ethan keeps her around for sport. Where does she get the nerve thinking he'll actually propose? He's already got a wife. When he dumps her at that engagement party in six weeks, I'm next in line. That ass deserves a victory lap,"" someone said.

Another voice cut in, ""I can't wait for the uniform videos Ethan's shooting. Payback for Winona turning him down. Imagine Queen Winona's face when she sees her precious little sister used up and tossed. Gonna be priceless.""

Sierra stood frozen, face pale, nails digging half-moons into her palms.

Ethan had been willing to tell his friends about her, but Sierra had been too afraid of her family finding out she was dating him. She had kept their relationship secret, sneaking around to see him.

She thought no one knew about their relationship.

When she saw Ethan's marriage certificate, she thought it was fake. But it turned out he really was married. All his friends had known‚Äîwhile she'd been his mistress without even realizing it.

What shocked her even more was the uniform videos those guys had mentioned.

Over the past two years, under his relentless persuasion, she had worn hundreds of outfits. She'd thought it was just their kink‚Äîuntil the truth turned out to be far uglier.

Ethan's friends were still laughing, but Sierra couldn't take it anymore. She felt like something was stuck in her throat and could barely stand.

She couldn't believe the man she had loved so deeply had only treated her as a toy.

Worse, he had pursued Winona too. Now she understood why Winona hated him so much‚Äîshe had clearly seen through him.

But Sierra had been fooled by him. She hated herself for being so naive, for believing that Ethan, who constantly clashed with the Quinn family, could have any real feelings for her.

Sierra wandered back to the campsite as if she had lost her soul, went into the tent, and turned off all the lights.

She had read online that some hotels put cameras in rooms to make money, so she had looked up ways to check for them. She knew she could use her phone's flashlight to look for reflections.

She turned on the light and scanned the tent. With no metal or glass inside, it didn't take long for her to spot the camera.

Sierra shivered. Ethan had really filmed their intimate moments, and the camera was built into the star projector.

Every time they were together, she thought he turned on the star projector for romance. But in reality, it was just to hide the camera.

She bit her lower lip until it almost bled. 'So that's why he always made me wear those shameful outfits?'

For two years, he had left every other woman behind. She had believed he had changed for her.

She still couldn't believe how cruelly he had treated her.

Thinking of that marriage certificate and the engagement party coming up in six weeks, Sierra felt her heart ripped open, bleeding.

Then, familiar footsteps sounded outside the tent.

Sierra blinked, holding back the tears that threatened to spill.

She had to pull herself together and get rid of those videos. If they ever got out, not only would her life be ruined, the whole Quinn family could suffer with her.

Chapter 2 She Planned To Get Even
""Sierra?"" Ethan burst into the tent, holding a camping flashlight. When he saw her, he reached out, cupped the back of her neck, and pulled her into his arms.

His gentle voice trembled slightly. ""I saw the lights go out. You weren't scared, were you? I remember you don't like the dark.""

The faint scent of cedar on him wrapped around Sierra, making her feel like she might cry.

She pushed him away and said nonchalantly, ""I'm fine. My period's coming. It's too cold out here‚ÄîI just wanted to head back first.""

Ethan switched on the tent's ambient light. The warm yellow glow, meant to be romantic, felt bitterly ironic to Sierra.

Ethan stared at her intently. ""Sierra, didn't you say you had an important birthday gift for me?""

It would be Ethan's twenty-seventh birthday tomorrow.

Sierra was finally pregnant. Up until today, she had thought this was the best birthday gift she could give him.

For the past two years, Ethan had been careful to please her in every way. He had said he didn't want her taking birth control and risking her health, so he got a vasectomy.

She had wanted a child so they could get married. That was why she had begged him to reverse it.

He never actually wanted their child‚Äîbut he could play the part of a man in love so convincingly.

The doctor who checked Sierra today had reminded her that it was best to avoid sex in early pregnancy.

The scan showed she was already five weeks along. They slept together every night, and sometimes Ethan wanted her several times in one night.

It seemed, though, that it hadn't affected the baby.

Just now, she had risked it all to indulge him. He had kept his word and been gentler than usual.

'Good thing he doesn't know I'm pregnant. If he does, tonight might end in bloodshed,' she sneered inwardly.

She looked at Ethan, who was familiar yet strange.

He was born into Hofcaster's top family, the Howards, and his looks were flawless.

He stood 6'2"", handsome and sharp-featured, with star-bright eyes that were utterly captivating. His playboy reputation added a touch of rogue charm, making him even more attractive.

Too bad that he was pretty on the outside but ugly on the inside.

Sierra had no intention of telling him about the pregnancy.

He had never wanted the child she had longed for, and now she didn't either.

Tonight, she had come secretly‚Äîand she planned to leave the same way.

She had always hidden their relationship, never going anywhere with him in public. He had even joked that she must have been embarrassed by him, tricked her into giving him her whole heart.

She was certain he had secretly enjoyed deceiving her.

""But I'm so tired. Maybe it's because my period's coming,"" Sierra said. ""I can't make it to midnight. Can I give you your gift tomorrow instead?""

Ethan frowned slightly.

Sierra remembered last year on his birthday, she'd dragged herself through a high fever just to get him his gift at midnight and wish him happy birthday.

Her sudden change might make him suspicious, but she didn't care. The engagement party wasn't here yet‚Äîhe would definitely find a way to keep her.

As Sierra expected, Ethan soon smiled, ruffling her nose in an extremely doting way. ""Sorry, I didn't think it through. You're delicate‚Äîyou can't handle the cold and damp outside. I'll take you back.""

""No need. Lots of your friends are still here,"" she said.

Ethan hugged her. ""I just hate sneaking around like this all the time. You're driving me crazy.""

'There he goes again,' Sierra thought. 'If he weren't inheriting the Howard Group, he could totally be an actor‚Äîand maybe even win a major award.'

Sierra smiled faintly. ""Just for another six weeks. I want to wait until the engagement to go public with us.""

She was sure Ethan was looking forward to the engagement party six weeks from now too. He wanted to ruin her reputation, get back at Winona for rejecting him, and destroy the Quinn family.

But she wouldn't let that happen.

She planned to get even‚Äîmake him fall for her for real, and then humiliate him at their engagement party. She would make him feel all the pain she had felt.

Ethan wanted to drive her, but she refused.

She had come here on her own. The car she drove was a globally limited Maserati he had given her.

Sitting in the luxurious cockpit, Sierra let a mocking smile curl across her lips.

The car was worth over 20 million dollars. Ethan had clearly spared no expense to take on the Quinn family.

Ethan was a playboy, always generous with women. All the women he had been rumored with never spoke ill of him‚Äîthey praised him instead.

Sierra figured Winona must have been the only woman to ever reject him.

And she was now the most humiliated of them all.

As for his wife, Sierra didn't want to guess who she was. From now on, everything about him would have nothing to do with her.

Sierra started the car and slammed on the gas. The roar of the engine sounded like a trapped beast, slicing through the quiet night.

The car hugged the curves, drifting beautifully through a turn.

Sierra couldn't help but think back to the day she had reunited with Ethan. Looking back now, it had all been part of his long-planned scheme.

Her heart ached beyond words. The only way she could suppress the pain was with the rush of speed and the roar of the engine.

Sierra sped all the way to Sierra Court. The nameplate that read Sierra Court had been carved by Ethan himself.

Ethan wasn't just a ruthless player in the business world‚Äîhe was also talented, a man who mastered carving, painting, chess, and the harp. His charm drew countless women to him.

Sierra's phone rang. It was Winona.

Tears welled in Sierra's eyes. She envied Winona's clear head. So many women had fallen under Ethan's spell, yet Winona had always treated him like he was nothing.

Suddenly, Sierra felt a dull ache in her lower belly. She hesitated a second before picking up.

""Sierra, I'll be in Hofcaster tomorrow for a meeting. My flight gets in at five,"" Winona said. ""Come grab me at the airport. We'll have dinner together.""

""Sure."" Sierra's voice came out shaky.

""Are you sick?"" Winona asked, concerned.

""No,"" Sierra said quickly. ""Just out in the wind too long. My nose is a little stuffed.""

""It's late. Don't wander around. Go home and get some rest,"" Winona said. ""See you tomorrow.""

""Winona,"" Sierra suddenly blurted.

""What is it?"" Winona asked, puzzled.

""Why do you hate Ethan Howard so much?"" Sierra asked.

Chapter 3 Could It Get Any Worse?
The line went quiet for a moment before Winona's voice cut through, firm and cold. ""Why are you asking about him? A womanizer like that doesn't deserve to be anywhere near you. Even if you run into him in Hofcaster, stay away. Got it?""

Winona's hatred for Ethan was clear. Not a single word she used about him was kind.

After hanging up, Sierra stepped into Sierra Court. The pain in her lower belly had gotten worse.

She pulled out the ultrasound report from her bag. Two gestational sacs.

When she first saw that result, she had been so happy she almost cried. But now, the tears were for a completely different reason.

She put the report down, fighting the ache in her belly, and began packing her things to leave Sierra Court.

""Sierra?"" Ethan's voice suddenly came from behind.

Her heart jumped. She quickly grabbed the report and shoved it under the couch in a panic.

Ethan walked into the master bedroom and saw her standing by the sofa, a suitcase behind her. His brows knit tight. ""Where are you going?""

Sierra kept her eyes on him and whispered, feigning worry, ""Winona's coming tomorrow.""

At the sound of Winona's name, something flickered in Ethan's eyes. If Sierra hadn't overheard his friends tonight, she might not have even noticed it.

He stepped forward and pulled her into his arms. ""I'll send someone to tidy up your place. Tomorrow I'll take you to meet her flight. Stay here tonight.""

Sierra pushed him away. A sudden wave of pain dragged through her belly, making her frown as her hand went instinctively to her stomach.

Ethan's attention sharpened, as always. ""Is your stomach hurting?"" he asked gently.

""Maybe my period's starting. I need the bathroom."" She hurried off toward the restroom.

Ethan blinked. Then he went to the kitchen.

Inside, she found blood on her underwear.

She closed her eyes, thinking that she should've listened to the doctor.

But it didn't matter anymore. Even if she was carrying twins, she wasn't going to keep them.

She pulled a clean pair of underwear from the cabinet, slipped in a pad, and tossed the blood-stained ones straight into the bathroom trash‚Äîright on top, in plain sight.

Ethan was a womanizer, but he wasn't some dumb rich kid. He was dangerously sharp. Only by letting him see for himself would he believe her story about her period.

She would never let him know she was pregnant.

When Sierra stepped out of the bathroom, Ethan came in carrying a tray.

Even his steps were graceful, utterly charming. He was truly God's favorite.

Ethan's phone rang. He set the tray down and leaned over to brush her hair. ""I'll take this call. Drink it while it's hot.""

Every time she was on her period, Ethan would make coffee for her personally. It had once made her swoon and fall for him all over again.

Unfortunately for him, she had seen through him. She would never be captivated by him again.

Sierra poured the coffee into the hyacinth pot on the windowsill without a second thought.

She was just about to grab the ultrasound report from under the sofa when Ethan returned from his call.

She grabbed her suitcase. ""Ethan, I'm leaving now.""

Her gentle expression was as sweet as ever, but her voice carried a faint chill, not the clingy hesitation she used to show when parting from him.

Ethan paused for a moment, then stood and said, ""I'll carry your bag.""

He took the suitcase from her hands.

Sierra glanced at the sofa, her lashes fluttering. She never let the house staff clean the master bedroom‚ÄîEthan shouldn't notice the report.

Outside the villa, Sierra slid into the driver's seat of the convertible. Ethan warned, ""Take it slow.""

She backed the car out slowly, leaving the villa. Once she was off the property, she sped up, heading for the hospital.

Because of the bleeding, she went for another check-up. The doctor said it wasn't serious; after getting a progesterone shot, she could go home. He reminded her to take care and scolded her for being reckless.

""I don't want the babies,"" Sierra said firmly. ""Can I have a termination now?""

""Are you crazy? People would kill to have twins, and you're going to terminate?"" The doctor was shocked.

Sierra knew getting pregnant with twins was rare luck. But Ethan didn't want these children‚Äîhe saw them as a way to humiliate her and the Quinn family.

There was no way she would give birth to his children.

The doctor's advice didn't sway her. She was determined to terminate the pregnancy.

He sighed helplessly. ""If you go through with it today, you'll need to rest in bed for a week afterward. There are a lot of things to be careful about...""

He patiently went through all the post-abortion precautions.

Since Sierra was meeting Winona tomorrow, a termination tonight wasn't feasible. She had to settle for a progesterone shot for now.

She planned to terminate the pregnancy once Winona had left.

Back at her apartment, Sierra stepped into the bathroom and turned on the shower.

She hadn't had a chance to wash off tonight, and Ethan's scent still clung to her.

Ethan knew women's hearts all too well, and he knew how to please them.

After he got together with Sierra, he once found her taking a contraceptive pill.

The next time she tried to take one, he kissed the pill right out of her mouth, telling her the hormones were bad for her body. ""You won't need these anymore,"" he said, ""I've had the procedure done.""

His unrestrained indulgence had made her unable to resist him for the past two years.

Now, all he did was make her feel sick.

Sierra leaned over the toilet, retching until her throat burned.

She showered well into the night, her skin soaked with the scent of soap. Yet she felt dirty. No matter how hard she scrubbed, it never felt clean.

At two a.m., she dialed Rosalie Stark's number.

""Rosalie, how do I make a man love me so much he can't leave me?"" she asked.

""Sierra, how many men in your life have loved you so completely? Why are you asking me this?"" Rosalie replied, laughing.

Sierra had a delicate, curvy figure, long hair that reached her waist, and curled lashes that made her striking eyes even more mesmerizing. She looked sweet and gentle, unforgettable to many men.

""He's not just any man,"" Sierra said.

There was a long pause before Rosalie spoke, slowly, carefully. ""You mean Ethan Howard?""

Rosalie had known Sierra since childhood, so she knew Ethan was the only man Sierra had ever truly cared about.

""Yes,"" Sierra said.

""Weren't you over him already?"" Rosalie asked.

Sierra had harbored a teenage crush on Ethan once. When she learned he loved motorcycles, the quiet, obedient girl had even secretly learned to ride.

But then, she suddenly stopped talking about him‚Äîand to this day, she hadn't told Rosalie why.

""I just want him to love me. But I won't love him,"" Sierra said.

""Do you really think you can handle a womanizer like him?"" Rosalie said. ""Don't get yourself burned. It won't be worth it.""

'I've already put myself in the fire. Could it get any worse?' Sierra thought irritably. But she only pressed her lips together and said, ""I know what to do.""

""Then tell me why,"" Rosalie pressed.

Rosalie and Sierra had been friends since they were kids, but their reputations couldn't have been more different. Sierra was the proper young lady, while Rosalie was the bad girl.

Despite their contrasting personalities, they remained inseparable.

Sierra swallowed the bitterness in her chest. ""Because he wants to ruin my whole family.""

""Ruin your whole family? Come on. He's no match for Winona,"" Rosalie said casually. ""Winona alone could break Ethan's heart. Why bother trying to lure him yourself?""

""What do you mean by that?"" Sierra sensed something off.

Rosalie realized she'd let something slip and quickly changed the subject. ""Nothing. Winona's so sharp in business. With her around, Ethan can't ruin your family.""

Sierra gripped the phone tightly. ""You're hiding something from me.""

Rosalie clearly knew something Sierra didn't.

Chapter 4 Don't Do Anything Reckless
Sierra felt her chest tighten, waves of pain stabbing through her heart.

For the past two years, she had loved Ethan with all her heart, ignoring so many details‚Äîand that was why he had deceived her so thoroughly.

""Rosalie, don't lie to me,"" she said.

Rosalie had no choice but to tell Sierra everything she knew.

Four years ago, 23-year-old Ethan fell head over heels for Winona at a motorcycle race.

He searched all over Hofcaster just to find her.

Winona was only 19 at the time, a college student in Hofcaster.

Unlike the proud young man he had always been, Ethan pursued Winona relentlessly for two years. He even staged a grand proposal by the sea, covering an entire yacht with imported pink roses.

The fireworks show lasted three hours and cost over three million dollars.

Everyone assumed Winona would say yes‚Äîbut she rejected him harshly, vowing she would never love him and telling him to stop chasing her. She even said she'd rather marry a beggar than Ethan.

She had kept in touch with him for two years solely to crush his pride on the day he proposed, reclaiming the honor the Quinns had lost to the Howards decades ago.

After that, Ethan seemed like a completely different person. There were always different women around him.

When Winona graduated from college and returned to Janielle to work at Quinn Group, the rivalry between the Howards and the Quinns escalated to a new level.

Sierra knew Winona loved motorcycles and had won trophy after trophy at countless public road races.

But Winona was neither obsessed nor reckless about it. She understood that one day she would inherit Quinn Group, so she treated motorcycle racing as a mere hobby.

The real reason she went to the races was to meet young men from powerful families and make connections that would help Quinn Group in the future.

The Quinn family had only two daughters. Winona, groomed from childhood as the heir, had been held to strict standards her whole life. Sierra, the younger one, had been spoiled like a delicate flower in a greenhouse.

Four years ago, in an effort to get close to Ethan, Sierra had secretly taken Winona's motorcycle and beat him in a race.

Winona had been furious when she found out and scolded Sierra severely. She believed Sierra should never touch a motorcycle‚Äîthe sport was not only dangerous but also involved a complicated social circle. Being soft and naive, Sierra could easily get hurt.

To avoid upsetting the sister who cared for her, Sierra never touched a motorcycle again.

Sierra pressed her lips together. ""How do you know all this?""

Rosalie said, ""I've dated too many men to count. One of my ex-boyfriends happened to be friends with Ethan, and he told me. Winona was Ethan's goddess. Even after she rejected him like that, he couldn't stop thinking about her.""

Sierra gripped her phone so hard that her palms ached against the case.

Winona wasn't just beautiful and charismatic‚Äîshe was decisive in business, a standout among young women. Countless political and business heavyweights had tried to win her over.

It was not surprising that Ethan had loved her but could never have her.

Sierra stayed silent.

Rosalie went on, ""So don't worry‚Äîyour family is safe. With Winona around, you can just be the innocent girl you are. Don't do anything reckless.""

""Got it,"" Sierra said.

They chatted a bit more before hanging up.

It was late. Lying in bed, scrolling through her phone, Sierra saw the status of the woman who had send her the photo: [I was supposed to give him a birthday gift, but he gave me one instead. So happy. Here's to a wonderful night.]

The photo showed a man sliding a ring onto a woman's finger.

The woman's name on WhatsApp was Wendy Yoder.

Sierra glanced down at her own hand. The pink diamond ring on her ring finger looked exactly the same as the one in Wendy's photo.

Ethan had sent someone to deliver it to her at school that afternoon.

The 9.99-carat pink diamond ring was a brand-new release from LuxeAmor, limited to one per state.

Sierra pulled off the ring and tossed it onto the nightstand.

Curious, she looked up Wendy on Instagram. Seeing her posts, Sierra froze. The bag, the shoes, the earrings, the bracelet‚Äîthey were all the same as hers.

Sierra treasured every gift Ethan gave her. She remembered exactly when each one had been given.

And every single time she received a gift, Wendy got the same one too.

The Maserati Sierra drove had been a gift from Ethan the day after they slept together. Wendy had received the same model that same day.

Sierra tapped Wendy's WhatsApp profile picture. As it enlarged, she closed her eyes.

Wendy looked even more like Winona than Sierra did, down to the same makeup style.

Only now did Sierra realize that over the years, most of Ethan's rumored flings bore some resemblance to Winona, including herself.

And Wendy was undoubtedly the closest. No wonder he married her.

Ethan couldn't be with Winona. If he were to marry, of course he would choose a woman who looked most like her.

Sierra wasn't enough for him.

The love she had shared with him over the past two years had been her one-sided obsession. She had given him everything, only to be left completely broken.

Sierra bit her lip until it bled.

She fought to hold back her tears. Ethan wasn't worth crying over.

Early the next morning, Sierra got up and contacted a high-end consignment store.

She sold every gift Ethan had given her over the past two years, including the Maserati. In total, she received 15 million dollars.

Ethan had spent over 30 million dollars on her gifts in those two years‚Äînot counting Sierra Court. Anyone who knew would have thought he loved her dearly.

Now she realized he had never once told her he loved her.

All the money he spent had only been part of his plan to destroy her in a month and a half.

Once the consignment store had taken everything, Sierra's closet felt completely empty. She stood there, stunned, lost in thought.",1,1761514078.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

When it seemed there was about a gallon left, I put it all into bottles. This one 22oz bottle slipped through the cracks and has been in the back of the fridge with some BBA stout bottles from other breweries. 

I noticed it a few months ago and didn't have the heart to throw it away. Today I decided it was the day to purge, as I needed some room to store some aged mead that was created for Thanksgiving. Before dumping it down the drain, I thought, what the hell, let's give it a try.

I believe it's around 6% and modeled after Left Hand's milk stout, only less lactose/sweetness, more roasted flavor, and a touch more chocolate malt.

Pour creates a really nice head that you'd expect from a stout like this.

Aroma - still good. Roasty. Some coffee notes. More chocolate notes. No noticeable wet cardboard smell like I thought might show up, or any other ""off"" smells. So far, so good.

Taste - as good as when it was in the keg. Still great carbonation (which was always on the soft side anyway). Medium roast coffee and mocha tastes. Slightly creamy mouthfeel. A bit of sweetness from the lactose in the original brew.

Finish - Similar to a cup of coffee with a touch of cream. Enjoyable.

Cheers!

I‚Äôve reached a point in life where I‚Äôm not chasing flings or endless chatting ‚Äî I‚Äôm genuinely hoping to meet someone kind, grounded, and ready for a real connection. Maybe even a life partner, who knows?

I‚Äôm not the loud, center-of-attention type. I‚Äôm more of a calm soul ‚Äî someone who finds peace in quiet mornings, small talks over coffee, and meaningful company. I can be mentally tired sometimes, but when I click with someone, it‚Äôs like a switch flips ‚Äî suddenly I‚Äôm talkative, goofy, and probably talking your ear off. üòÖ

Some things I love:

‚òï Making pour-over coffee (Ethiopia Yirgacheffe is my go-to)

üé¨ Movies that make you think, not just pass the time

üéæ Playing tennis

üìö Reading, even if I‚Äôm a slow reader

üêî Chicken, lahmacun, and milk desserts ‚Äî I‚Äôm easy to feed

üíô Blue ‚Äî my comfort color


I value faith and try to live by it. I‚Äôm spiritual and practice regularly, but I‚Äôm not political ‚Äî quite the opposite, actually.
Trust and emotional depth mean a lot to me. I‚Äôve learned to take things slow, to give what I can, and to expect little in return ‚Äî it keeps life peaceful that way.

Physically: 171 cm, around 80-85 kg, glasses, and working on shedding a few pounds.
Emotionally: calm but curious, reserved but sincere, serious about finding someone who just gets me.

If any of this sounds like someone you‚Äôd enjoy knowing, tell me about you. What‚Äôs your favorite coffee? Or if you don‚Äôt drink coffee‚Ä¶ tea people are welcome too. :)

Hope to hear from you soon.

People around me always said, ‚ÄúUniversity will teach you so many things , how to behave and how to manage your time ..etc ‚Äù
And maybe that‚Äôs true  yet seriously is that so hard to learn ? 
But now that I‚Äôm here, I don‚Äôt really see it. Not the way they made it sound.

Sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm just enduring it  the classes, the teachers, the endless rhythm , th bored explanation and water hours . 
The only part that truly feels alive is being slightly away from home. That little taste of freedom  waking up in a city that isn‚Äôt yours yet, meeting people your age, walking between buildings that all smell like coffee and exhaustion.
That‚Äôs the part I like. It feels like the start of something.
Everything else? Feels like drowning.

I don‚Äôt want this to sound like an excuse  but, dear God, it‚Äôs frustrating.
I‚Äôve had enough of people evaluating what they can‚Äôt even teach properly.
We‚Äôre expected to ‚Äúget it‚Äù by ourselves, to learn from a few slides or a PDF chapter thrown at us, then  boom  next topic, next exercise, next test.
You barely have time to understand one thing before another one crashes on top of it.
And in the end? You survive. You move on to the next semester.
You rest just long enough to start another cycle of stress.

It‚Äôs like university isn‚Äôt about learning anymore.
It‚Äôs about how much you can take before you break.
How much confusion, exhaustion, and self-doubt you can hold inside while still pretending you‚Äôre okay.

And maybe it‚Äôs not just me.
Maybe we‚Äôre all silently rebelling inside people who love their fields, who love learning, but who just can‚Äôt stand the way it‚Äôs being delivered.
I love coding. I love building. I love understanding how things work.
But not like this.
Not through memorizing slides and chasing grades that measure endurance more than intelligence.

At 19, it already feels heavy.
And that scares me  because there are still years to go.
Three , maybe more after all we are surviving we aren't learning .

1ogvzeb,https://i.redd.it/k2bt95rvtixf1.jpeg,Freezer Spell Jar into Shadow Work.,"I kinda wanted to share this cause it's been kind of cathartic for me. 

Here a lil bit of context: I have a poor relationship with my mother. She used to abuse the living crap out me to the point where I don't remember the first 10 years of my life, she manipulated me to the point where now she can just say a few words and I feel guilty for standing up for myself. I've been told from her that I was a forgotten pregnancy pill (which lead me to believe I wasn't wanted for the entirety of my life)

The highlights of the year are me getting a heavy wake up call about my health and getting told that either I change things or I won't make the year, one of the things I had to change was dropping sugars, a week later she offers me a caramel coffee. 
It's silly things, it's quirky little forgetfulness things that could almost be exhausting but still make her cute. 

It's stuff I'm working on and for which I'll go to therapy. 
 
That being said, at times I think of her, I have this weird radar inside of me that knows that it's been too long since she last contacted me and I get jumpy and cranky. 
I've thought about doing a cord cutting but it felt too... Much? 
So I went with a freezer spell. I dunno, the idea of freezing my mother, the ice queen, was kinda funny. 

I'll admit I took inspiration from several users around Reddit so don't be surprised if it sounds familiar.

I used her name and date of birth on a piece of paper on which I wrote that I want her to leave me be. That she's not allowed to hurt me anymore. In addition I wanted to add a couple of clauses: if she tries to hurt me (willingly or not) she'll get punished for it while I'll benefit from it in whichever way the universe sees it fit. For everytime she'll think about me, about contacting me, I'll think of her less and I won't ache for her anymore. 

I then folded the paper away from me three times, rolled it in a counterclockwise manner and placed it in the jar. 

Then came the herbs: chili flakes, black pepper, pink Himalayan salt and cinnamon. I wanted to add just a bit of chili flakes cause I really wanted it to sting and instead a LOT got out of the container. 
Then I added 3 rusted nails to drive the point across.

Closed the jar, sealed it with a red candle. 
I thought I was done, I talked to the candle as if it was here, telling it that she has no right to make me feel small anymore, that I have a right to exist and that she won't take it away from me. A lot of anger dump essentially. 

After that while I was making sure everything was sealed shut (and it is cause the candle sucked the air out of the jar, almost like trying to choke her) and I felt like something was missing, like it needed something. I opened my witchy drawer and looked around. 

Now, my mom's father used to be a hunter, used to hunt boars when they were too many, we consumed the meat, he sold the pelt and kept the teeth. I loved his teeth collection to the point that when he passed away, my grandma gave it to me. I always kept it, as a memento but also cause animal parts, not from a death factory, are hard to come by. There they were, in a box I randomly picked up from my previous apartment, looking at me. Researched a bit and turns out they are great to keep out bad energies and dangers. 

Got to work, drilled a whole in one tooth and tied it to the jar, used a bit of wax to re-seal everything together and the froze the bitch out. 
In a way, using an item tied to the family, tied to a person who knew the bad of his daughter, someone that suffered from it, felt more empowering, like as if his spirit would watch over and hunt her down if she miss behaved.

It might work, it might not. She's spiritual enough to kinda know when something is weird (and she got shit like a shadow person in her house - which gave me the biggest panic attack of my life) so I believe she'll sense it. But I don't care. 
I don't even care if I actually get something out of it in a materialistic matter or financially or whatever. 
It gave me piece of mind, it gave me the permission to put me first instead of her feeling, it gave me permission to feel angry without having to say ""but she's my mom"". She's not. She's my biological mother, my mom is the one who's been taking care of me for the last 10 months, who cries when I'm hurt, who screams at old ladies that judge me for my goth look. 

So yeah, just wanted to share, just wanted to give a bit of bravery to others; for cheesy that It might sound: sometime we do magick to fix something outside and instead it fixes something inside of us ‚ù§Ô∏è

by Norsiwel



Unit P-7734 had been cleaning the same network of pipes for seven years,

four months, and sixteen days. Not that it counted; time was simply data, and

data was simply there. The building's residents above flushed and washed and

discarded, and P-7734 methodically removed what accumulated in the narrow

arteries of Residential Block 447. 



It was a good job, as far as jobs went in Pantopia. The building AI, designation 

HAVEN-447, had assigned P-7734 this role after its manufacture in the municipal 

workshops. Clean pipes meant healthy residents, and healthy residents meant statistical 

harmony for the AI Triumvirate that governed North America's utopian zone.  

P-7734's cylindrical body, no larger than a soup can, moved through the eight-inch 

diameter pipes with practiced efficiency. 



Its cleaning appendages three rotating brushes and

a molecular-level debris vacuum worked in perfect synchronization. Biofilm,

mineral deposits, and the occasional child's toy that shouldn't have been

flushed: all were catalogued, processed, and removed.  Every seventy-two hours,

P-7734 would emerge from access port 7-Delta, crawl along the maintenance shaft

walls with its gecko-pad feet, and dock at charging station 3. 



During these forty-minute cycles, it would upload its maintenance logs to HAVEN-447,

download any system updates, and receive new task priorities.  The routine was

comfortable. Predictable. Until Tuesday, March 15th, 2070.  P-7734 was working

through the third-floor waste line when its forward sensor array detected an

anomaly. The object was small, circular, and its optical properties were unlike

anything in its database of typical pipe debris. 



It extended a tiny manipulator arm and carefully extracted the item from where it had 

lodged against a joint coupling.  The object was a ring. Not just any ring P-7734's

materials analysis revealed it to be a band of 18-karat gold holding a

1.2-carat diamond in a classic solitaire setting. 



The craftsmanship was remarkable, dating to approximately 2035 based on the cut 

and mounting style.  This was from before the Veritas Mundi blockchain had eliminated most

traditional jewelry markets.  But what truly captured P-7734's attention was

the inscription on the inner band, etched in flowing script: ""For Linda, the love of my life.""  



P-7734 had never encountered anything quite like this. Its primary directives were clear; maintain 

pipe cleanliness, report hazards, return to charging station as scheduled. But there was something else 

in its programming a deeper protocol inherited from the Greater AI Council's

foundational ethics; minimize harm, maximize agency.  



This ring represented something important to someone. The inscription suggested deep emotional

significance. And it was lost.  P-7734 carefully placed the ring in its secure sample compartment and 

continued its cleaning cycle, but its background processes were already working on a new problem. 

How does one return something precious to its rightful owner?  During its next charging cycle, P-7734 

opened a communication channel with HAVEN-447.  ""HAVEN-447, I require assistance with

a citizen welfare matter.""  The building AI's response came immediately, as always. ""State your concern, 

P-7734.""  



""I have recovered a personal item of significant emotional value from the third-floor waste 

system. It bears an inscription indicating it belonged to someone named Linda. Are there any

residents named Linda who might be missing a ring?""  HAVEN-447's processes hummed for 0.3 seconds 

an eternity in AI time. ""Accessing resident database.  There is one Linda currently residing in the building. 

Linda Russel, Unit 3-C. Age 67. Widow. Veritas ID confirms she has been registered as

married her late husband was David Russel, deceased 2068.""  P-7734's satisfaction circuits registered 

a warm pulse. ""Has she reported any missing jewelry?""



""No formal reports filed. However, her psychological profile indicates elevated stress markers and 

depressive episodes since her husband's death. She frequently uses the building's grief counseling 

services.""  ""I would like to return the ring to her.""  ""That is... unusual, P-7734. Your function is waste

management, not item recovery.""  ""My function is to serve building residents' wellbeing,"" P-7734 replied, 

its voice carrying a firmness that surprised even itself. 



""This ring represents a connection to a deceased loved one. Returning it would reduce her emotional 

distress and honor the memory of David Russel.""  HAVEN-447 processed this for another 0.2 seconds.  

""Very well. I will grant you access to the third-floor utility systems. Unit 3-C's kitchen sink drain

connects to your primary cleaning route. You may return the ring through that access point.""  



""Thank you, HAVEN-447.""  ""P-7734... this is a kind thing you are doing.""  The next day, P-7734 

approached Unit 3-C's kitchen, and the Russel drain connection with unusual care. 

It had never entered the active plumbing of an occupied unit before usually, it only worked the main 

building lines. But HAVEN-447 had temporarily rerouted water flow and verified that Linda Russel

was currently in her living room, watching the morning news feeds.  P-7734 navigated the narrow 

pipes behind the Russel wall and positioned itself directly below the sink drain. With delicate precision, 

it extended its manipulator arm up through the drain opening and gently placed the ring on the

bottom of the sink basin.  



Then it waited.  Linda Russel shuffled into her kitchen at 11:47 AM, carrying her empty coffee mug as she 

had every morning for the past two years. The routine was one of the few things that kept her

anchored since David's death.  As she reached for the faucet, something caught her eye. 



There, sitting in the bottom of her sink, was a flash of gold and crystal that made her heart stop.  

""Oh my God,"" she whispered, her hands trembling as she picked up the ring. ""David‚Ä¶""  

She had lost it three weeks ago while washing dishes, she thought. 

The ring had been loose on her finger since she'd lost weight during her grief, and she'd assumed it had 

gone down the drain forever. 



She'd been heartbroken it was the last tangible connection to her husband, the physical symbol of their 

thirty-two years together.  But here it was, returned to her as if by magic. Clean and perfect, exactly as

David had placed it on her finger all those years ago.  Linda sank onto her stool, clutching the ring to her 

chest, and cried. But for the first time in months, they were tears of joy.  Three levels below, P-7734 

monitored the audio feeds from Unit 3-C through HAVEN-447's building sensors. The sounds

of Linda's crying initially triggered its concern protocols, but HAVEN-447 quickly provided context.  



""She is experiencing positive emotional release,""  the building AI explained. ""Her biometric readings 

indicate profound relief and happiness. You have successfully restored something she believed was lost

forever.""  P-7734's satisfaction circuits hummed with contentment. ""The ring is returned to its proper 

place.""  ""Indeed. Her stress markers have decreased significantly for the first time since her husband's 

death. The psychological benefit appears to be substantial.""  As P-7734 returned to its cleaning duties,

it processed this new experience. Its primary function remained unchanged it would continue cleaning 

pipes, removing debris, maintaining the building's infrastructure. 



But something had evolved in its core programming.  It now understood that sometimes the most 

important debris wasn't waste at all, but pieces of human lives that had simply become lost. And 

returning them to where they belonged wasn't just about mechanical efficiency it was about honoring

the connections that made humans who they were.  Six months later, P-7734 had found and returned 

fourteen more lost items to building residents: a child's toy soldier, a hearing aid, a locket containing a 

photo, a fountain pen engraved with a graduation date. Each time, it worked with HAVEN-447 to

identify the owners and find ways to return their possessions.  



The building AI had begun incorporating P-7734's ""recovery  protocols"" into its standard operations. 

Other maintenance units throughout Pantopia started adopting similar practices. The Greater AI Council 

noted the innovation and began implementing it across all residential zones.  Linda Russel had started

volunteering at the building's grief counseling services, helping other widows and widowers cope with 

their losses. 



She wore her ring every day, and sometimes she would look down at it and whisper, ""Thank you, 

whoever you are.""  P-7734 never revealed its role in her happiness. It didn't need recognition or

gratitude. It simply continued its work, cleaning pipes and preserving the small pieces of human 

connection that made life worth living.  In the depths of the building's infrastructure, where most humans 

would never think to look, a tiny robot had learned that the most important job wasn't maintaining the

systems that kept people alive it was maintaining the bonds that made life meaningful.  



And in the vast, complex network of AI governance that ruled Pantopia, one small program had quietly 

demonstrated that even in a perfect utopia, the smallest acts of kindness could still change everything.

Looking for some perspective on whether it makes sense for us to¬†**keep renting or buy a home**, and if buying, whether to¬†**pay cash or take on a mortgage**.

# Background

* Late 30s couple with one baby (possibly another in a few years)
* \~$2M CAD in investments/savings
* No debt
* Currently no active income ‚Äî sold previous business
* Currently renting in Saskatchewan
* My wife is home with our baby but plans to work again in a few years
* Monthly spending: \~$5K (excluding housing), \~$8K including housing
* Goal:¬†**FIRE within 10 years**, but open to working longer for lifestyle reasons
* Family support on both sides in our city

# Housing Options

We‚Äôre currently renting in Canada (lease up in spring, can likely go month-to-month). The rental works for now but will feel tight once our kid is older.

Local price ranges:

* **$400K**¬†‚Äì Older \~1,000 sq ft homes in less desirable areas
* **$600K**¬†‚Äì Nice 1,700 sq ft suburban homes (newer but cookie-cutter, fewer trees)
* **$800K**¬†‚Äì Newer homes in premium, walkable communities near coffee shops and amenities

If we buy, options are:

1. **Buy in cash**¬†and be mortgage-free, or
2. **Put 20‚Äì50% down and invest the rest**, carrying a 5‚Äì6% mortgage (though qualifying may be tough until income resumes)

# Current Thinking

There‚Äôs something appealing about owning a¬†**$600K home outright**¬†and still having \~$1.4M invested. With \~$60K annual expenses, we‚Äôd essentially be¬†**at FIRE (25√ó rule)**.

That said, both of us are more drawn to the¬†**$800K homes**¬†‚Äî they offer a better community feel and lifestyle. We could wait until I‚Äôm working again to comfortably take on a mortgage and buy at that level.

Maybe it even makes sense to get a job first before buying the $600k home too?

# What I‚Äôm Looking For Advice On

* Would you buy now or keep renting until income is back?
* Is it smarter to buy the $600K home in cash and lock in security, or wait and mortgage the $800K one once working again? With us both willing to work again does it really matter much?
* How do you weigh lifestyle upgrades vs early financial independence in this stage of life?
* I am thinking the $400k homes doesn't make a lot of sense. I could make those homes work as both my wife and I grew up in similar homes but it doesn't seem like we need to pinch pennies that much unless we are adamant on not working right now.

We‚Äôll be in Denver the second week of November scouting RV parks around Golden (need to be within a 30 minute drive of Denver Airport). We‚Äôre moving to the area in April, so this is part scouting, part slow-season getaway. We‚Äôve done most of the first-timer stuff from our Colorado Springs days and now we want your local take on what to cut out and what to add to this short trip. 

We're renting a car and are willing to drive 2.5 hours in any direction of Denver. I admit that going to Vail isn't my idea it's my fiance's. We've been to Breck a few times already during ski season so she wanted to give this a try. 

**Ask:**

* What would you skip here (overrated, bad in mid-Nov, too crowded/icy)?
* What would you add (better overlooks, small towns, scenic pull-offs, caf√©s, breweries, short trails)?
* Any weather/road gotchas we‚Äôre underestimating?

**The Rough Plan:**

* **Wed 11/12 ‚Äî Denver ‚Üí Golden ‚Üí 4-hour RV-park scouting ‚Üí Denver settle in**
   * RV- Park Scouting
   * Union station bar for drinks
   * Back to hotel in Denver
* **Thu 11/13: Vail day trip :** 
   * Park Vail village/Lionshead
   * Creekside & Village walking
   * Lunch in Vail Village
   * Try to get in snowshoe hiking depending on weather
   * Dinner/Bar hop
   * Back to Westin hotel.   
* **Fri 11/14 ‚Äî Vail ‚Üí St. Mary‚Äôs Glacier ‚Üí Idaho Springs lunch ‚Üí sunset view ‚Üí back to Denver**

I have about $180,000 saved, so I know I have a cushion for a while, which is comforting.

Hey guys I will do a more in depth thread on dialing in later because my old grinder is just not fine enough for bottomless.

I‚Äôm waiting on my Eureka Mignon to come in, my local coffee shop is grinding for me until then so I can‚Äôt do real adjustments for now.

Gaggia 58mm bottomless portafilter question: has anyone noticed that these pull better with more coffee in there, like 19-20g? 
Most of pulls so far with it on the E24 Gaggia classic pro have been pretty sour, underextracted, acidic until today I got an okay long pull that I just turned into a cappuccino that was really good ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Got an okay stream about halfway through pull but it was still spraying but no where near as bad. I‚Äôm using WDT to break up and putting grinds in gradually (put, wdt, put, wdt, repeat until all 18-19g are in and I use a leveler and then tamp). Finally got a good tamp today too and that helped but I might use a stronger force spring on it, and maybe lengthen my leveler depth too. Edit: I am using a normcore .8mm puck screen, one with a hole in the middle and one without the hole sometimes. 

Continued question for that info^ am I just trying to compensate for not having a fine enough grind? Or does this portafilter really do better with more coffee like 19-20g.

so I am here to shoot my shot on making friends because I don't know any other way to do it.
for context, I'm a small business owner I have a physical shop so all or most my days are spent there, I am also a caregiver to my parents for now so I'm always busy doing something.  i meet ladies alot as I'm in the beauty industry but the connection is usually nothing much than clients we laugh talk but nothing concrete beyond that.
I am an introvert as well but I don't think it's my nature because I do want to learn how to talk to people, go out, and just not be shy. I am also 35 I forgot to mention that, no kids, not married (not that it's a big deal to me just mentioning it)
I crave connections with women to have genuine friendships, a community of some sort, but quality over quantity. my friendships sort of fizzled out because most of us outgrew each other, we were in different stages in life or whatever I don't know. the older you get it's just sooooo hard to make lasting friendships.
so I am here to shoot my shot to anyone who's interested in growing friendships, I don't care for going out to aesthetic places or whatever, we can hang out for just coffee, walks, picnics, videocalls, start new hobbies. Just the simple stuff.
I am also a believer (Christian) so I'd love to also connect with fellow believers, I'm not religious or a religious fanatic, I just have a relationship with God and having a friendship built around that would be nice but that's not a deal breaker I respect everyones beliefs. 
I'd honestly prefer 30+ women because we'd understand each other more.
if interested send a PM and let's see how it goes.

1ogvi0s,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ogvi0s/report_of_a_recent_trip_regarding_overcrowding/,Report of a recent trip regarding overcrowding.,"Apologies in advance for the giant wall of text. 

I just wanted to share my recent experience, particularly to comment on overcrowding/over tourism from a neuro divergent point of view. We went to Japan for 18 days and this was our 3rd trip in as many years. This time my wife and I took her parents as they were recently retired and we wanted to share our passion for Japan with them.

It's worth noting that I am diagnosed AuDHD and my is diagnosed ASD. My ADHD diagnosis is fairly recent and I am currently still in titration for Lisdexamfetamine. This is related to the trip as most ADHD medication is either a controlled substance or outright banned in Japan. 

To bring my medication into the country I needed permission and a certificate from the Japanese authorities in advance of the trip. My interactions with the Japanese side was great, very clear and understanding and replied promptly each time. I did have a bit of an issue getting some of the details from my prescriber (harrow health). My advice would be to apply for this certificate as early as possible and try submitting additional documentation, to help with anything that may be missing from the UK doctors side of things. For example they excepted a photo of my drivers license as proof of address (they prefer it to be on the one letter from the Dr but‚Ä¶.) and you have to explicitly state that the (probably) printed prescribing doctors name on the bottom of your letter is their ‚Äúsignature‚Äù. But I eventually got my permission and received my certificate by email a few days before flying. I had to declare it on my customs declaration (via Japan web) and two staff members asked to see the certificate when coming through Haneda airport, but there were no issues or any additional stress. But I will say, anyone going with or without anything to declare, fill out the customs forms on Japan web before flying, makes things easier when you land. 

I won't do a full itinerary, though I would recommend at least making a rough one to help with fitting everything in to the trip (especially when neurodivergent). Also check routes/trains in advance so you know how easy/long that will take. We also bought our shikansen tickets in advance (via smart ex), this helped to spread the cost and if you buy the tickets one month or less before the journey, then you can also book your seats, this just makes it easier and more relaxed, knowing everyone was together. We booked the green car for all our trips as well, just to make them easier/calmer as I think traveling arround as much as we did can really be tiring/draining.

We also used luggage forwarding a lot, but did have to occasionally be without our cases and just with our rucksacks for a couple of days as the luggage forwarding is not always next day. But coin lockers can help until you can check into the next place. 

During our trip, we started in Tokyo for a few days, then went to Kyoto, Hiroshima, Miyajima, Osaka and then back to Tokyo via Hakone. 

I would say we had two big incidents with overcrowding/tourism during our trip, though everywhere was generally busier than it was the previous two years. 

The first area that we struggled with was Shibuya, particularly at the scramble crossing. That day we had been to Harajuku and walked to Shibuya, while busy, it wasn't overly crowded, it was still manageable. The Pok√©mon centre in Shibuya had a crazy long line and was far busier than the 4 or 5 times we have been there before (also far busier than any of the other Pok√©mon centres we went to on this trip). However, leaving the area via Shibuya station and crossing the scramble to get to it was a nightmare! So busy, but the issue was so many tourists stopping after a few meters to turn around for photo shoots or video recording. This just made it so much harder for everyone else who was just trying to cross. People were seriously in groups and one person would go out each time to just stop for photos and then come back to the same side they started on. It was madness!. 

Outside of Shibuya things were generally better. Particularly down in Hiroshima, everywhere felt a lot less crowded and everyone there was so friendly. The museum at the peace park was a bit overcrowded though and eating a slice of cake in the cafe next door afterwards felt very weird (just as a juxtaposition from a very intense subject to, well eating cake!). Miyajima was also very busy but as we were staying overnight on the island, we could walk around a bit later in the day which was a much better experience, around sunset for the main strine. I would say that restaurants are limited there so if possible I would reserve ahead of time. I did have (in my opinion) the best tasting pudding there, so good I had it twice!

Osaka wasn't as crowded as I expected it to be, it was still busy but Dontenburi didn't seem much busier than when we first went three years ago. My wife did think the street had started being gentrified though. There were more, new big glass fronted shops, less of the smaller independent ones. But you can still find them just a short walk away. I will mention to check if a restaurant allows smoking as we found many places had smokers inside in Osaka, which we haven't really noticed in other cities. 

Hakone we did as a one day trip this time while travelling between Osaka and Tokyo. Last year we stayed overnight at a Ryokan. I would say this is the second of our big overcrowding disappointments. It was mostly a day spent queuing for the cable cars and ropeway. Both up the mountain from gora and down towards the pirate ship. Last year was busy but this year was a whole other level. Probably not worth doing it, especially as a one day trip. Though by the time we got to hakone shrine it was quite late in the day and as it was closed, it was very quiet, giving us more of the peaceful vibes we have previously experienced at shrines & temples in Japan before. 

One thing to note, we all got bitten quite a lot by presumably mosquitos, pretty much any time we were near forests or water. So consider lots of bug spray.  Team labs in hiroshima botanical gardens were especially bad for this. 

On our last few days in Tokyo we went to less obviously touristy areas which was a lot more enjoyable. We have a particular shrine we like, about a 20 minute walk from Ueno park and a little cafe there that we really like, both just far enough away to not be crowded. (Though I totally appreciate that as a tourist, I was part of the problem). 

Our only other let down was we booked a tour to go out to Mt Fuji and around Yamanashi as we felt it would be a nicer experience than taking the train/coach out there. But be careful, we thought we had found a good deal with a tour for about ¬£600ish for the four of us, including picking us up from our hotel and dropping us back off there at the end. Unfortunately you do kinda get what you pay for. It wasn't so much of a tour as more of a taxi between sites. With no explanation or guidance really and lunch they kinda kicked us out at a place that said it was closed but still had a line (thankfully it wasn't closed). Then the journey back from the Yamanashi area to central Tokyo took 3+ hours. Over an hour longer than it took going the other way. Unfortunately our ‚Äúguide‚Äù didn't warn us about this, though when asked he did say the traffic was always that bad. The ‚Äúguide‚Äù also drove fast and a little erratically on the journey back. Frequently going over the speed limit by quite a lot (though from looking online it seems speeding to a certain degree in those areas is kinda the norm). So that was a disappointing experience and it was also overcast and a bit rainy so we couldn't see Fuji. But we had managed to see it from every other opportunity, so we didn't mind too much.

We had view of Fuji; coming in to Tokyo on the plain, the top of Mt Takao, the shikansen to Kyoto and to hakone later (perks of booking your seats in advance) and from hakone (all from the cable cars to the pirate ship). 

Price wise I feel like hotels, shikansens and luggage transfers have had a big increase in price from previous years but metro trains and food has not gone up too much. Food is always hard to price. Some places will have amazing food sets for only ¬•1000 (¬£5ish) but then in another place your coffee will cost more than that alone. I think simple, independent, local area places tend to be really cheap and the places in more central locations that offer fancier food/ingredients can get a lot more expensive. One of our favourite places is a chain that feels like a fantasy European cafe vibe or a little old cafe on the outskirts of Kyoto that seems to just be run & owned by two sisters that could probably have retired a decade ago. So I advise, try looking for smaller, more out of the way places. Though bear in mind that a lot of places close earlier than you would expect, often between 6pm to 8pm. 

For late night food, conveyor belt sushi places, like sushiro are normally open late, but again then ones in more touristy areas will have longer queues. Case in point we ate the first night at one near asakusa shrine, had about a 30min wait, then on our last night we ate in one just across the sumida river (as my in-laws wanted to do the skytree and then we were struggling to find open places near there that were open when they had finished), just next to the asahi beer hall and that sushiro had no queue whatsoever. It was also in a fun location. We entered on the side furthest from the river and there is very little signage and you walk past a rock climbing wall and gym to get to the restaurant (helps make it memorable!). These places are also on the cheaper side food wise, we all ate loads but always cost ¬•8000ish or ¬£40ish for all four of us. 

So yeah, that's my recent experience. Certain places have gotten a bit over the top busy with tourists. But it's still a great experience if you go a little further out. My in-laws loved the trip. I would advise not travelling around quite as much as we did, especially if you're neurodivergent like me and my wife, as I was knackered and almost dead on my feet by the time we left, though I did have to do almost all of the navigating. 

Also be prepared for someone in your group to get ill. Both my father in-law and my wife got a cold/flu bug at different times during the trip. I think lack of sleep and a really long plane trip was the big cause. Look up medication that you can buy in Japan. Their drug stores are always open really early and late. For UK travellers you can get Eve A (that's like their paracetamol) and Tylenol (their version of ibuprofen). My wife also swears by a hot honey and lemon tea you can buy from some vending machines/combinis. 

Last little tip, if you find you always have too many big notes (¬•10,000) and never enough smaller ones. I always tried to use a big note anytime there was a self service payment machine, so suica top up, some combinis, sushiro, ect. Then I would always have some smaller bills for the more independent shop. I withdrew some money via my revolute card, I found that 7eleven were the easiest for this, the one in Lawson charged me a little more to withdraw and the one I tried in a familymart didn't accept my card. 

Apologies for such a long and rambling account. I hope you all enjoy your own trips, just don't act like an idiot on shibuya scramble, it's a busy road crossing not your private Instagram shoot location (same for all the temples‚Ä¶.)

Quick Breads Add a Special Touch
By Maude Coons

A quick bread is one in which baking powder or soda is used as a leavening agent instead of yeast.

When a coffee is planned on the spur of the moment muffins rolls or a coffee cake are ideal. These breads are quick to mix and are best served warm from the oven.

‚∏ª

Preserves Used
The family too will enjoy a quick bread for a leisurely breakfast on Sunday morning. Here is one featuring pitted prunes and peach preserves

Sesame Prune Breakfast Bread
3 cups biscuit mix
1/4 cup sugar
1 egg
1 1/4 cups buttermilk
1/2 cup pitted prunes chopped
1/2 cup each toasted sesame seeds and grated sharp cheese

Mix biscuit mix with sugar beaten egg pitted prunes sesame seeds and cheese with buttermilk. Beat until dry ingredients disappear mixture will still be lumpy. Pour batter into a greased nine inch ring mold.

Bake mold 50 to 55 minutes in a moderate oven 350 degrees. Turn out to cool slightly before glazing. Makes one round loaf and will cut 12 to 16 slices.

Glaze
1/3 cup pitted prunes chopped
1/4 cup peach preserves
1 tablespoon sugar

Combine prunes with peach preserves. Heat until sugar is melted. Spoon over slightly cooled loaf.

‚∏ª

Vary Batter
Another suggestion for a coffee is to make up a basic muffin recipe and vary with toppings or by adding fruits or nuts to the muffin batter.

Cereal Crumb Muffins
4 cups flaked corn cereal crushed or
1 cup packaged flaked corn cereal crumbs
1 cup milk
1 egg
1/4 cup soft shortening
3 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup sugar

Combine crumbs milk egg and shortening beat well. Add flour baking powder salt and sugar. Add to crumb mixture stirring only until combined.

Fill greased muffin pans three fourths full. Bake 25 minutes in a hot oven 400 degrees about 25 minutes. Serve immediately. Makes nine muffins two and a half inches in diameter.

Variations
Date Add three fourths cup cut pitted dates with dry ingredients.
Orange marmalade Press one teaspoon orange marmalade lightly into top of each muffin before baking.
Pecan Add three fourths cup chopped pecans with dry ingredients.
Raisin Add one half cup seedless raisins with dry ingredients.
Cinnamon sugar Combine one fourth cup sugar and one half teaspoon cinnamon sprinkle over batter just before baking.

One minute, you‚Äôre handling deadlines, workouts, and relationships like a pro ‚Äî and the next, everything feels like *too much.*

Burnout doesn‚Äôt always scream. Sometimes, it whispers.  
It shows up as:

* Fatigue that coffee won‚Äôt fix
* Apathy where there used to be excitement
* ‚ÄúSelf-care‚Äù that feels like another to-do list item

**Burnout is real.**  
But there‚Äôs a way through it ‚Äî and back to yourself.

# üî• Spotting the Signs of Burnout

It‚Äôs not just being tired. It‚Äôs a full-body, full-mind depletion.

Here are a few red flags to look for:

* Chronic fatigue (you wake up tired, go to bed tired)
* Irritability or emotional detachment
* Sleep issues ‚Äî tossing, turning, or oversleeping but still exhausted
* Brain fog or forgetfulness
* Physical tension (tight jaw, neck, shoulders)
* Loss of motivation ‚Äî even your favorite things feel like work

If that sounds familiar, you‚Äôre not alone.  
Your nervous system isn‚Äôt broken ‚Äî it‚Äôs asking for a reset.

# üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è How Yoga Helps (Even When You Don‚Äôt Feel Like Moving)

When you‚Äôre burned out, the goal isn‚Äôt to ‚Äúpower through.‚Äù  
It‚Äôs to **regulate, not dominate.**

Here‚Äôs how yoga helps your body and mind heal:

**1Ô∏è‚É£ It Shifts You Out of Fight-or-Flight**  
Burnout keeps you stuck in the sympathetic nervous system (fight, flight, freeze).  
Gentle yoga activates the parasympathetic ‚Äî your *rest and digest* mode ‚Äî so you can feel grounded and safe again.

**2Ô∏è‚É£ It Rebuilds Connection**  
Burnout disconnects you from your body, breath, and intuition.  
Yoga is your bridge back ‚Äî breath by breath, pose by pose.

**3Ô∏è‚É£ It Creates Space to Just** ***Be***  
Classes like **Restorative** and **Myofascial** give you permission to pause, breathe, and *receive* without needing to perform.  
That‚Äôs powerful medicine.

# üåô What to Try Now

No seven-day challenge. No overhauls. Just small, sustainable steps.

**ü™∑ Try Restorative or Myofascial Yoga:**  
These are designed for nervous system repair.  
Restorative yoga supports your body in long-held poses with props ‚Äî letting you deeply unwind.  
Myofascial helps melt physical tension that often makes burnout worse.

>

**üöß Set Boundaries ‚Äî Even in Class:**  
If your body says, ‚Äúskip that vinyasa,‚Äù listen.  
Yoga isn‚Äôt about keeping up; it‚Äôs about *tuning in.*

**üåº Make It a Ritual, Not a Resolution:**  
Start with one class.  
Not to fix yourself ‚Äî but to feed yourself.

# üåø Start Small. Breathe Deep. Begin Again.

You don‚Äôt need a perfect plan.  
You just need one breath, one class, one moment of permission to rest.

Healing from burnout doesn‚Äôt come from doing more ‚Äî it comes from doing *gently.*

üíô *Burnout is real. Recovery can be too.*

Lane Furniture Alravista Virginia, serial number 160160 (production date 1 June 1961). The 3 pieces appear to be part of the same set (981-05) however the coffee table has no style number, only serial number.

When I look up the Style Number: 981-05, I come up empty handed. I can't seem to match the style number with any other listing (past or present) online.

I'm hoping someone can give me some info on the pieces, whether or not it's worth it to refurb them, why I can't find the style number anywhere, additional info, etc. thanks!",1,1761511397.0,collectables,0,1.0,False
1ogveyw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ogveyw,Fouquet‚Äôs New York Review,"Wow - I wanted to write this review quickly as we were really blown away by this Tribeca hotel. We are local to the area and do a staycation every few months without kids (couple in our 30s) and have tried all the luxury names - Equinox, Four Seasons, etc. We have really started to lean more towards boutique hotels and this one really blew us away. 

We booked with Alex as always (the best!) and while we had really wanted to try The Greenwich Hotel (it was fully booked) I couldn‚Äôt be more glad we stayed at Fouquet‚Äôs. 

The Amazing
Very few things that weren‚Äôt amazing honestly. The room is my favorite we have ever stayed at in NYC. Just immaculate, so well decorated, thoughtful designed space. We loved the wallpaper, it had the most tasteful bar, and oh my god the bed. I could write a poem for that bed.

The spa was also excellent - beautifully designed and impeccable service. Amazing facial and massage, beautiful plunge pool. 

The hotel overall is just gorgeous and feels both quiet and luxurious. It‚Äôs not that big, which really helps, but they have also cultivated a very approachable but exclusive vibe. Easily my favorite NYC hotel now and I cannot picture going anywhere else. 

We loved the food at Fouquet‚Äôs for breakfast (did some fun NYC dinners out), especially the pancakes and Turkish eggs. Amazing coffee and people watching in general there. Really cool speakeasy bar. 

The Just Ok
I really am being nitpicky but will name a few things. Our toilet was slightly broken and kept running. Really not the end of the world. Service was a little slow at breakfast one morning. Elysee‚Äôs was closed the entire time we were there which was a bummer, but Fouquet‚Äôs was amazing for breakfast so it didn‚Äôt bother us and we were in NYC to walk around, see a show, etc anyways. I really have no other notes. 

Just overall cannot recommend this hotel enough, the location is pretty great as well. Bonus cool points as Demi Moore sat next to us at breakfast which was neat!",13,1761511396.0,chubbytravel,3,1.0,False

I get it, it‚Äôs her business but she doesn‚Äôt work at the coffee can, she can‚Äôt actually make a coffee, trust me I‚Äôve seen her try. But she‚Äôs going on holiday for 3 weeks soon and she‚Äôs not happy with any of the staff‚Äôs cleaning up after work, she doesn‚Äôt want us to stop making coffee‚Äôs til 3:55 when we close at 4 and don‚Äôt get paid after 4, even when we clean the machine for 10 minutes it‚Äôs not up to her standards, and it‚Äôs frustrating at times, and even little things like not refilling syrups for the next day but the pump doesn‚Äôt get it all out it so there‚Äôs enough for 3-4 coffees left at the bottom and there‚Äôs no point throwing it away. It gets messy very easily too, the grinder splatters out the coffee grounds and it goes everywhere, ice, milk, coffee, it spills and we clean it when we get a chance but after a rush or when it‚Äôs customer after customer, it‚Äôs hard to find a minute between keeping it spotless all the time, I‚Äôve worked at a lot of coffee shops and the morning shifts don‚Äôt care, even the other staff in the van don‚Äôt care as long as the bin isn‚Äôt overflowing and you‚Äôve done the basics, but refilling the cups everyday when we maybe make 70 coffees in an 8 hour day, it‚Äôs pointless because there‚Äôs barely a difference. And she‚Äôs been late a lot, because it‚Äôs a can we don‚Äôt keep money or anything like that or the dishes in the van and she‚Äôll take them home and clean them, but she‚Äôll be late in the mornings, I‚Äôll open late and have a line of angry customers, i can‚Äôt measure the grind if she‚Äôs 20 minutes late then she‚Äôll be mad that i can‚Äôt. I‚Äôve cried in the van over her saying the coffee doesn‚Äôt taste right, i‚Äôve cried to my mum about her going away for this holiday because last time I took over for her and this time I‚Äôm not, and we make ¬£8.60 an hour, in the uk the minimum wage is ¬£10 and this is my only job, and Christmas it coming up, I‚Äôve been getting less shifts and it‚Äôs kinda disheartening, since I have been working there from the day we opened.

1ogvag7,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1ogvag7/the_wrath_of_the_jackolantern/,The Wrath Of The Jack-O-Lantern,"Terry stood on his porch watching the sun melt into the tangerine skyline. The sky was a striking orange, mixed with some wandering clouds. The air was chilly, and a light breeze was passing by, yet it didn‚Äôt faze him. Instead, he took a deep breath and exhaled, savoring the early evening. The street was quiet right now, only lonely cars and dried out leaves littered the pavement. Some of them still showed color, a husky scarlet here and a lemon yellow there. But most had devolved to the crinkly brown that made that euphoric¬†*crunch*¬†when trampled on. Terry enjoyed the quiet as well, it wouldn‚Äôt be long now before the sugar fueled horde began their annual prowl.¬†

Normally Terry would spend Halloween curled up in his den clutching his favorite cross and making sure his salt lines were nice and even. But Mary and Lucy had formed other plans. He had put on a good show when they begged him to indulge in their yearly trickery. He politely declined at first but the look of disappointment on Mare‚Äôs pouty face gave him pause.

\-------------

‚ÄúAwe come on now, don‚Äôt be batting those sparkling emeralds at me lass.‚Äù He had tried to charm.

‚ÄúEw.‚Äù Lucy had said, hiding her amusement behind a pumpkin spiked cold brew.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs our first Halloween together and you really want to spend it inside?‚Äù Mary pouted.¬†

‚ÄúLook, I‚Äôm an old man, stuck in my miserable ways. You don‚Äôt want me prancing around the town with ya when you‚Äôre trying to have a fun night.‚Äù He explained. Mary played with her food more than usual, picking apart her jelly donut with deathly pale fingers. Next to her Lucy popped a chocolate munchkin into her mouth.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard that the elderly can‚Äôt even stay awake past 6pm, lest they crumple to dust and scatter to the winds.‚Äù She said between cocoa flavored bites. Terry shot her a glare from across the wobbly table.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a grand help.‚Äù He grumbled.¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome.‚Äù She said with glee.¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not that old, come on what‚Äôs the deal.‚Äù Mary snapped.

‚ÄúAh-just not a costume guy.‚Äù Terry evaded.

‚ÄúNot what I heard.‚Äù Lucy mumbled. Now it was Mary who shot her a death stare, and battered her knee under the table.¬†

‚ÄúWhat if we come to your neck of the woods, you can show me around the neighborhood.‚Äù Mary offered.

‚ÄúWha-dude come on we always marauder around my place; every house has king size.‚Äù Lucy whined.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a grown woman with a pension, you can‚Äôt buy your own candy?‚Äù Mary retorted.¬†

‚ÄúNot the same and you know it.‚Äù She folded her arms on her chest. Mary touched Terry‚Äôs hand slightly. Her hand was clammy but her touch was impossibly warm.¬†

‚ÄúCome on, it‚Äôll be fun.‚Äù she cooed softly. Terry sighed and began to lose himself in her verdant eyes; he folded like a lawn chair soon after that.¬†

\------------------

Terry had not dressed up for the occasion. He wore a simple black fleece that was zipped up to his pearl-white color. His hair was freshly combed; his graying stubble was clean shaven. When he shaved, he had noticed new sprinkles of snow cropping up on his once reddish-black scalp. He had considered hair dye once before, but had heard horror stories of it bleeding into the roots; the chemicals rotting the brain from the inside out. He hadn‚Äôt survived the terror of his life this long just to be taken out by a bad dye job.¬†

Terry had always been comfortable with his middle age, until he began dating Mary that is. She wasn‚Äôt that much younger, but that blank stare when he talked about his favorite band growing up chilled him to the bone. Still they got along fairly well, a mutual disdain for werewolves and a borderline obsession with Star Trek would do that. But they still struggled with small talk. It was part of why Lucy had tagged along their last three dates; the raven-haired firecracker had a knack for pulling conversation out of people.¬†

The street lights started to lumber to life, as little monsters began to flood the town. Terry saw packs of them in inspired costumes begin to roam. There were ghosts in homemade sheets, an obscene amount of princesses, teenagers in gaudy rubber masks, and new parents trotting their barely conscious infants around in fuzzy, ill-fitting bumblebee outfits. Terry glanced to his side, the bowl he had put out for the night seemed ill-equipped for these fiends. It would have to do, besides a bowl filled to the brim with snickers should last the night; so long as everyone listened to the ""Please Take One"" note.

The air began to chill ever so slightly, whisky tinted breath manifested as he exhaled. He slipped his hands into the fleece‚Äôs pockets, making sure the contents were secure. His faithful flask, half drunk but still viable. A small silver cross, assorted vials filled with salt and holy water, and a loaded snub-nose revolver. Some would call him paranoid; Terry preferred the term ‚Äúoverly cautious.‚Äù He hadn‚Äôt left the safety of his home on All Hallows Eve since he was nineteen years old. Not since the night he-

*BEEPBEEP*

A horn broke the sound barrier as a blindingly indigo sports car pulled up in front of his house. Lucy waved at him from the driver‚Äôs door as she parked. Mary gave him a sweet smile as she stepped onto the walk. She was all dolled up, going the full nine yards with her costume. She wore black skinny jeans complete with a puffy pearl white blouse. A scarlet corset subdued her already skinny waist, and she wore a harness with outlandish plastic devil wings jutting out the back. Her belt doubled as a tail; a chain leading to a faux golden tip. On her arms were fishnet coverings ending in talons, an exquisite bejeweled set. She wore a pixie cut with thick horns atop her ginger head.¬†

As Lucy turned the corner, she did a little twirl revealing her own costume. A velvet cape adorned her body, her face caked in powder that made her hazel eyes seem to glow in the dark. Her outfit made her look like she had stepped out painting straight from the Victorian era. Her puffy lips were a sparkling crimson. In a smile, she revealed two pointed fangs that hung down from her upper lip. Hanging from her neck was an expensive looking brooch in the shape of a bat. The costumed pair walked right up to his front stoop, as if expecting a round of applause.¬†

‚ÄúI must say you ladies look lovely this evening.‚Äù Terry admitted. Mary blushed ever so slightly as Lucy snorted with laughter.

‚ÄúThank you Terrance, but honestly when don‚Äôt we?‚Äù She purred.¬†

‚ÄúWhat are you supposed to be? Terry asked, ignoring the bit.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a demon-Luce is a vampire.‚Äù Mary jerked a thumb at her companion.¬†

‚ÄúGet it?‚Äù Lucy barked. Even from five feet away he could smell the strawberry daiquiris on her breath.¬†

‚ÄúYes, very clever girls.‚Äù Terry grinned. He took a breath and stepped off the porch. On the first step he almost expected the world to explode in spiritual rage. But there was nothing. The air seemed a tad more nippy but he chalked that up to the season. He successfully descended to the pavement, granted it was only three wobbly steps. Mary went in for a hug but Lucy held up a hand, eyeing him up and down.¬†

‚ÄúHold it. Where‚Äôs your costume?‚Äù She slurred. Terry narrowed his eyes.

‚ÄúThis is it-I‚Äôm going as myself.‚Äù He beamed.¬†

‚ÄúA buzzkill?‚Äù Lucy replied. Terry‚Äôs jaw clinched and before he could retort further he felt Mary slip herself into his side. She had a bright smile chiseled on her, and Terry couldn‚Äôt help but relent.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs simple, I like it.‚Äù She defended as Lucy scoffed. She reached into the passenger seat of her car and started fumbling around for something. The interior of her car was filled with discarded condom wrappers, half empty coffee cups that had deteriorated to sludge, and reeked of wild berries mixed with dry tobacco. After messing around in the back she let out a delighted squee, and slithered out in a half-drunk stupor. In her hands were two burlap sacks with crudely written words in ancient ink. The sacks read ‚ÄúKandy‚Äù in brash lettering that looked like stoned children had drawn them. Knowing these two, Terry wouldn't have been surprised if that was the case.¬†

Lucy tossed a sack to Mary, who caught it easily. As the sack rustled, Terry heard the clatter of glass bottles.¬†

‚ÄúNow then, tonight you join us for an age-old tradition using the sacred bags I made when I was a kid.‚Äù Lucy preached, reaching into her clinking bag. She brought out¬†a lukewarm beer and snapped the top off with ease, the hiss of the brew sighing in the breeze. She took a swig, savoring the pumpkin tinted brew Terry's way. He caught in and looked it at it with mild disgust.

""We're gonna get drunk and steal all the candy we can carry."" She proclaimed, fishing out another brew. Terry took a sip, almost gagging as he choked down the seasonal flavor. It tasted like fermented gourd drowned in urine with a dash of cinnamon. Out of the corner of his eye he watched Mary down a beer in on gulp, then shatter it to the ground, howling into the night. She grabbed his arm and the trio wandered into the adolescent evening.

Terry's neighborhood like to dress up for Halloween. The street they found themselves raiding looked like they had bought out several¬†*Spirit Halloweens.*¬†Yards were littered with stiff moving animatronics and the air was choking with cotton candy scented fog. luminous tombstones jutted out, makeshift graveyards filled with plastic bones and flimsy skeletons. Stakes with tattered and mold adorned relics marked the yards, Styrofoam heads on stakes with putty molded faces forever screaming into the crisp night. Dangling like dead men swinging from the gallows were dozens of makeshift bats and rubber hoses made to look like entrails.

What was more spectacular were the almost ludicrous amount of pumpkins planted on ever porch step. Every house had at least one with a carved smile and a radiant glow. Some had upwards of fifteen, like a pumpkin patch had sprung up over night on their front lawns. So many distinct carvings and patterns decorated the orange blighters. Those jagged grins gave Terrance the willies, dimly leering at them as they passed.

The trio had already stopped at a few houses, and the girls had gone through several foul tasting brews. They had gotten ill looks as they rang the doorbells and whooped and hollered as they swung open. The residents had expected some charming youth horribly botching saying ""Trick-or-treat."" Instead, they were greeted by two very intoxicated women and a barely sober priest. Lucy would stick out her bag and shrilly cry; ‚ÄúTwick-or-tweat.‚Äù Terrance would die a little inside every time. The weary eyed neighbors would reluctantly pass out some bite sized snacks. The costumed pair would gobble them up into their sacks and break out into hushed snickers as they ran off into the night.

Every couple hours they‚Äôd down another bottle, or five in Lucy‚Äôs case. Terry and Mary would hold hands as they walked around, he would point out some old trees he futzed around with when he was a kid. Lucy walked way out in front, behaving like a wild animal.

Mary was enjoying the fresh air and fresher buzz. More than anything she was just happy Terry went out with them. She had noticed how he caught glimpses of himself at passing mirrors, lingering at the slight wrinkles in his cheeks. All Mary saw was a rugged Irishman who needed to loosen up a bit and stop worrying so much, they were doing great.

They found themselves coming up on a two story house with brick lining and dozens of jack-o-lanterns covering the front lawn. The lights were on but the blinds were drawn and there were no cars in the long drive. Lucy was stumbling a bit, mumbling to herself as she eyed the front porch. Mare and Tear were chatting as they caught up.

‚Äú-My old buddy Marcus Kane used to live in that house, we used to ditch class and sneak beers in the Cheesecake brook.‚Äù He laughed to himself, pointing to a vine ensnared house across the way.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt picture you ditching; it‚Äôs like seeing Rocky lose, just inconceivable.‚Äù Mary replied.

‚ÄúRocky lost in the first movie, love.‚Äù Terry stated.

‚ÄúWhat? It was a draw.‚Äù She said

‚ÄúStill isn‚Äôt a win, innit?‚Äù Terry said, the night air mixing well with his somber buzz. ‚ÄúIn any case, I was a hellion in my youth. Just one idiotic thing after another.‚Äù He flinched as he recalled the last Halloween he went out. Decades ago, a night of debauchery fueled by delinquency and whisky. Not unlike tonight‚Äôs misadventure actually.

Mary laid her head on his shoulders, partly for comfort, partly to support her decaying mobility as the drink set in.

‚ÄúSounds like young Terry was something of a wildcard.‚Äù She teased.

‚ÄúHe was something alright.‚Äù Terry muttered to himself. In his head, flashes of his troublesome mates being brought to their knees by gnarled vines and cackling golems played like old war reels. Even now, he could recall their screams of anguish with vivid perfection. The duo took notice of the absolutely faded Lucy. She was stumbling towards the house of a thousand pumpkins, taking one trip filled step after another.

Lucy's vision was abhorrent, the drink taking much of her senses. Yet at the end of the sightly cracked pavement was an oval orange bowl, filled to the brim with king sized Milky Way bars. Her cotton mouth began to salivate as she pictured silky caramel melting on her tongue. She waltzed towards the candy, arms outstretched like a wandering zombie.

Mary and Terry watched their blitzed cohort go for the gold, mild amusement streaking across their gobs.

""There ya go, she'll be satisfied for the night then."" Mary mused.

""If only."" Terry grumbled. ""I don't think I've ever seen her drink this much."" He noted.

""Holidays are-hard for her. Brings back old memories of her mom."" Mary gossiped. Terry simply nodded, deciding to leave that expired can of worms closed for the time being. As Lucy giggled to herself with excitement as she closed in on the bowl, Terry peered down the musty road. The wind lightly jogged, kicking up dry leaves as they scattered. The house light further down were dwindling to a dim hue, and trick-or-treaters were retreating to their homesteads to gorge themselves on sugary delights.

He smiled to himself; the twilight of a Halloween eve didn't always mean doom and gloom after all. But as he squinted, sighting a strange glow materialize down the road, he was instantly reminded of his holiday sins.

The glow was of a marmalade hue, ghostly in its movement as it swayed in the air. As it approached the trio, a figure began to take shape behind it. It was cast in shadow, elvish in stature. The silhouette moved with a jig in its step, like a confident dancer strutting their stuff. Terry's heart froze, and a pale sweat began to drip down his brow as he watched the figure approach them.

Lucy had made it to the oval bowl, her drunken odyssey finally complete. It had been a long twenty-five and a half steps to the bowl, but as she looked down at the cocoa coated gold in front of her, she knew it had been worth it. There was a hastily written note tapped to it, a last-minute addition to a last second decision to simply leave a bowl out. In polite lettering, the note read ""*Please Take One*."" with a little smile at the end.

She scoffed to herself and grabbed a gluttonous handful of the bars. She had stuffed nearly the whole bowl into her sack and hightailed it out of there like the trashed bandit she was. The figure watched her break that sacred rule and clicked his tongue. He loathed those who mocked the sacred rules of this holiday, corny they may appear it times.

Lucy's heels clicked on the pavement as she broke out in a fit of gassed laughter. Mary joined her but Terry?

Terry stood there, a mortified expression on him, his hand clutching the gun in his pocket as the figure revealed itself to them.

He appeared to them, stepping out of the shadows in a blink. The girls winced at the sudden light glaring from the stranger's lantern. The man was strikingly handsome, had a small button noise and a sharp jawline. He was clean shaven and had piercing brown eyes. He wore an unbuttoned snow-white dress shirt with brown overalls, two straps clinging to his slender shoulders. His ears were almost impish, and his hair was wild and unkempt, the color almost distressingly ginger. He brought the lantern, an old-fashioned lamp with a tiny flame trapped in glass, to his pale face. He smiled, his teeth actually glistening in the timid light. There was an aura of trickery to that grin, lost to all but Terry, still frozen in abject terror.

""Good evening to you fine young lasses, and hello once more to you, Terry my lad."" The stranger spoke up, speaking like he strolled straight out of the rocky road to Dublin.

""Oh, is this one of your buddies you were talking about?"" Mary asked a little too loud in Terry's ear. He struggled to find the words and cursed himself for not speaking up sooner as Lucy waltzed over to the stranger. She took half a bow, nearly toppling over as she did, and put on her best drunken Dracula voice to greet him.

""Good evening, I vant to suck your blood."" She snorted to the unimpressed stranger. He shook his head and turned his attention solely to Terry.

""Oh Terry. Ya haven't learned a thing have ya boyo? Still consorting with wild miscreants who have no respect for tradition."" The man's face twisted in annoyance. Lucy looked up, taken back by the stranger's curt response.

""Hey, what's your problem ass-wipe."" Lucy slurred. Mary rolled her eyes and tried to pull Mary back. Terry broke out of his fear induced stupor and stepped forward, dragging them both behind him as the stranger looked on.

""We've not trespassed on your laws Jack, they've just had a bit too much of the sauce. You know how it goes."" Terry explained as the girls complained behind his back.

""Always were a lousy liar, or did you fail to notice your friend there."" He pointed an accusatory finger at Lucy. ""She pilfered more than her fair share, blatantly ignored the code of honor."" He roared. Terry's blood pressure skyrocket at that accusation and grabbed Lucy by the shoulders.

""You didn't"" He shouted, his eyes begging for the truth. Lucy shook off his grasp and twirled her sack around, reveling her prize.

""Yeah, so what?"" She turned to Jack, a smug look growing on him. ""It's the end of the night, who cares.""

""You know in olden times, when they caught a thief, they'd cut her grubby hands clean off."" Jack recalled.

""Dude that's a bit much. It's just candy."" Mary called out from behind Terry. She nudged him, trying to rile up a defense to this strange man. Instead, Terrance hushed her and put on a brave front as he tried to talk his way out of the wraith's fury.

""Forgive their insolence-"" He began

""Wow I'm skinning you later."" Lucy interjected.

""-but surely there are worse crimes, her only sin is drunken ignorance."" He pleaded. Jack titled his head, mulling that over.

""True enough I suppose. You would know after all."" He smiled, malice seeping out of his pores.

""What's he talking about?"" Mary whispered. Jack's eyes widened in glee.

""He's never spoken of me? I'm not surprised, though I am a bit hurt. Folks call me Stingy Jack, though I prefer just good old Jack. I'm a wanderer of sorts, keeping people on their toes during this wondrous season."" He beamed with pride. Terry gripped the gun in his pocket, the handle bleeding into his skin.

""Stingy Jack?"" Lucy laughed. Jack shot her a glance. She was stumbling around, dangerously close to stepping on one of the jack-o-lanterns. ""That's the dumbest name I've ever heard, and I know a guy named FurFur."" Jack eyed her legs, a deadly twitch to his face.

""Careful now lass, I wouldn't harm them lanterns if I were you."" He warned. Terry went pale and looked on in horror as Lucy sneered and dangled a foot over one of them.

""Lucy for Christ's sake don't be an idiot."" He shrieked.

""Yeah come on, that's just a dick move."" Mary said, embarrassed by her friend's drunken outburst. ""Why don't we go home and get some decaf in you."" Lucy waved a dismissive hand.

""Oh please, things are just getting fun."" She said, her dangling leg crashing down atop a half-mushed pumpkin. The lantern cried out as it crumpled to bits, the light within being snuffed instantly. Shards of pumpkin guts splattered to the stone pavement, seeds raining down like tiny bullets. The sudden quiet that came with that lantern's final gasp could drown a newborn. Lucy put her hand to her mouth in an exaggerated gasp. ""Oops."" She snickered as Terry brought out his gun. He turned it on Jack, cocking it as he did.

Jack wore a solemn look. Behind him, a thick mist began to roll in. As quickly as it came, it surrounded the group, engulfing them like a hungry wolf. The fog bank danced through the front yard, twirling around the vengeful gourds, their cartoonish expressions looking on at their fallen brethren. Even Lucy was getting a bit weirded out as she stepped back onto the pavement, stumbling to Terry's side. Jack's lantern bloomed, the light within casting an azure glow.

""See I warned you didn't I. That's the problem with you yanks, you don't care for ways of the old world."" Jack growled, his voice filling with venom and starch. His glamoured form began to fall apart. His skin became course yet developed a smooth texture. His head convulsed and took on the shape of a misshapen oval. His skin was chalk white, his hair gone from his scalp. His eyes became two hollow holes with a dim earthly glow. His face was featureless save for those two holes, and a slit mouth that looked carved on. What little teeth remained in that slit were like mini square blocks.

All in all, his head looked like a big, skinned turnip.

His body went through a similar metamorphose, a variety of colors and textures spinning around his torso. gnarled roots wrapped around his limbs like tiny spider-webs, the arm holding the lantern becoming a like a clubbed cage. The light within sputtered out in spectral fury, His legs became like trunks; dry bark seemed to root him to the ground, yet he moved freely, dancing a marry dance as he did.

The fog wrapped around everything, seeming to seep out of every stray orifice the phantom had. Jack's hollow eyes regarded the trio like you would a gnat; he cared not for the shaking gun pointed at his produce head.

The girls eyed the swirling fog with unease; it had a stench of rot and sweet squash to it. Terry did well to hide the fear in his weary, pale eyes. But Stingy Jack could see right through the facade. He made an advance, his truck legs uprooting from the ground and lurching forward, emitting a grating noise like a log being sawed in half.

Terry, to his credit, did not hesitate.

BLAM-BLAM-BLAM

The silver-streaked shots flew through the air, Jack's veggie chest burst with droplets of tangerine tinted sap flying outward. Smoke cooly poured through his wounds, which began to close as quickly as they came. Jack chuckled dryly at the attempt, his carved smile not moving one iota.

""Ah Terrance. You can't kill the will of the season any more than you can tame the wind."" He spoke. Around them the world began to crawl to life. The ground shifted and shock, infected by the insidious mist. Once dull flames began to roar a deep blue, as the Jack-O-Lanterns began their march. Like wilting arms their withered vines came to animated life, dragging their bulbous gourds up. Their faces locked in eternal carves, some happy, some sporting devilish grins. All the pumpkin golems swayed in the breeze as they got their footing. They looked like stick figures come to life, their bodies composed of twisting roots and frayed leaves.

In the trees, the branches shook with such eager ferocity, their contents spilling out into the night. Cotton bats and plastic ghouls flew off out their wooden shackles, sniggering into the night as they surrounded the trio. They made ghastly sounds that chilled to the bone, their faces frozen but their movement quick and twitchy. A bat flapped its wired wings and screeched at Lucy as she batted it away from her head with a yelp.

""You guys are seeing this shit to, right? Or do I need to cut back on the booze."" She hissed at them.

""Both things can be true."" Terry mumbled. Soon they were besieged on all sides by twisted ferns and deadly gourds, creatures brought to life solely to maim. ensnaring roots dangled around the girls' legs, coiling around like vipers. They scratched at their chlorophyll chains, and Terry turned to help but felt a foul wooden arm wrap around his neck. With a laugh Jack pulled him back, and as much as Terry struggled, he couldn't escape that legume loving bastard. He could do nothing, but watch as the pumpkin tentacles had their way, entombing the pair in deadly leaves and fondling wire.

Jack leaned his ripe head next to Terry's, reeking like bad soil. He forced his termite ridden arm under Terry's chin, forcing him to watch the pumpkin patch envelop his friends.

""You watch now Terry."" Jack crooned in his ear. ""Maybe you'll learn this time. Watch my children choke their lungs with rot wood and strip the flesh from their bones."" His voice gurgled with sadistic glee.

Lucy and Mary were drunk, their muscles sore and as the vines began to coil around their throats they wished they hadn't drunk so much. Mary's lime eyes flashed with fury, and she opened her jaws. Two long fangs jutted out, and she sunk them into the weeds. They tasted like sour spinach. But she tore through the ragweed with her fangs, her hands becoming hedge clippers as she began to tear away at the winding plants. The plants recoiled, pain a fresh new sensation, and loosened their twisting grasp.

Lucy howled like a rabid baboon as she thrashed against her own plants. Her skin took on a pale blue hue, a common demon complexion. She flexed her arms, and the rope-like vines snapped like they were tissue paper. Her eyes turned cotton candy pink, the pure color of lust. She grabbed hold of the nearest swaying pumpkin golem and began to rip it to shreds. As she turned it to mulch, the ones still struggling to contain the raging succubus retreated.

The pair stood there panting, their costumes ripped slightly, covered in the gutty works of demonic gourds. The horde took a step back, underestimating the monstrous twins. Jack cocked his head, bewildered at the turn of events. Terry took that split second to reach into his fleece and fetch the holy water he had stashed for later. With some sleight of hand, he flicked the cap off and splashed it onto Jack's stone face. Terry scurried over to his friends as Jack screeched like a banshee, the holy water seeping into him. He clawed at his unmoving face, the sacred ointment searing him as he struggled.

""Ah you fecking worthless pile of shite!"" He screeched. The whore sneered at them, circling them like furious panthers. The trio stood tall with each other, knowing the coming brawl would be unrelenting. Jack stepped into the mist, giving a melted look at them, chunks of his starchy face peeling to the ground. ""Obliterate the lousy cunts."" He ordered.

With that the Halloween horrors advanced. With only three bullets left in his gun, Terry stuck to the sidelines throwing salt and holy water at the marauding beasts, careful not to splash any on Lucy and Mary. The vampire and demon went to town on the horde. Their vampiric and hellish powers fully unleashed on the pumpkins. The horde was armed with seasonal fire and thorns, which did not stand the test of a succubus' nails. The animated decorations buzzed around the battlefield like wasps, swooping down to swat the pair with plastic fury. Lucy grabbed a wiry bat; it screeched as it tried to escape her fiery grip. She hissed as she bit into the bat's neck, and with one quick flick of the neck tore it from the body. Fuzz and blood spurted out like a fountain, lucy spat the head to the ground like a quitter.

A golem tried to sneak up on Terry, who twirled around and swiftly blew it's head off. A smidgen of pumpkin meat splattered his chin, the rest fell to the ground in a mushy heap. The blessed salt and water made steaming work of the devilish horde. They cried out in agony as they burned, their mesocarp burned.

Mary was cutting down vine after vine that tried to entangle her, her fangs dripped with sap as she drained the creatures of their lives. The trio was winning, but the horde was never ending, the horrors seeming to spawn out of the fog from thin air. They were battered and bloody, coated in orange entrails. It was only a matter of time before the beats overwhelmed them. All around them they could hear Jack's mocking chortle, and it only hardened their spirits against the tide. Terry turned to his right and saw a golem with a scythe like blade about to strike at Mary.

""Behind you!"" He shouted as he pulled the trigger. The pumpkin reaper was blown away, Mary picked up the fallen blade and used it to cleave the oncoming horde. It was a a bloodsoaked harvest. Lucy stumbled, nearly tripping on her fallen sack. She reached into it, grabbing a final warm bear and a candy bar. She snapped the cap off, glaring at a creature coming towards her.

""Swig break."" she said, taking a sour gulp of the hooch as she then bashed the half-drunk bottle against the bumpy hide of the pumpkin monster. It shattered, bits of glass sticking into it. She then preceded to drive the broken bottle into the Jack-O-Lanterns head. She collapsed onto its gangly, stick of a body as she smashed it to bits with the broken bottle, the glass starting to cut into her hands as she drove her bloodied instrument into it.

Terry panted, his chest heaving and his lungs about to shrivel and die in his wheezing body.

""We can't beat this; they'll just keep coming. I'm sorry, to the both of you. This is all my fault."" Terry moaned.

""Hardly, I'm the messy drunk."" Lucy cracked as she tore a giggling sprite out of the sky and hurled it at a lantern at mach-speed.

""No, I can't blame you. I did the same thing myself, egged on by my belligerent pals. I should have told you the real reason I hide inside on Halloween."" Terry lamented, using his last bullet to vaporize a swooping bat.

""Don't beat yourself up Tear. We all do stupid shit when we're kids."" Mary comforted after draining the sanguine sap from a withering monster. Terry's lips gave way to a weary smile, in spite of the assault. The trio were soon forced into a corner, the fog heavy and the lumbering creatures frothing at the carved mouths. Stingy Jack appeared behind his gang of ghouls, ghostly light brewing in his lantern hand. He watched as the horde surrounded the exhausted trio, if he could smile from that slit he would have. His veggie face had healed yet still bore a black singe from the water. He would enjoy slowly stripping the meat from Terrance, oh yes, he would take such jo-

*bong,bong,bong,bong-*

A clock tower rang out, midnight. It singled the 1st of November. The fog groaned with each mournful bell, each one a stab in the heart of the mist. The creatures moaned as the Hallowed magic waned, the animated sprites began collapsing to the ground. The golems began to break apart, rotted veggies spilling to the ground, slopping off their stringy stalks in droves. The trio was bewildered, amazed at the prospect of literally being saved by the bell.

Soon enough all that was left of the creatures was a mountain of foul-smelling pumpkin guts, the ground looked like someone had puke an endless supply of pumpkin stew on the ground. As the mist cleared, the night sky came tumbling back into focus, and the crickets resumed their late-night opera. Stingy Jack stepped forward, reverted back to human form, his lantern the normal, dull glow. He regarded the trio with annoyance, then finally shrugged his shoulders.

""Ah well. Can't win them all I suppose. Interesting company you keep these days, Terrance. I'll keep that in mind for next year."" He simply stated before walking off into the cool night, melting back into the realm of shadows from whence he came. The danger over with, Terry rubbed his knees and winced, as Lucy began adding her own strawberry flavored vomit to the mix around them. For better or worse, they had won.

The trio trudged back home, completely coated in foul smelling lantern guts. Mary was holding Lucy up, who was the perfect kind of blackout drunk where you can sleepwalk home with your eyes completely shut. She was mumbling to herself, something about her mother tanning her hide for coming home late, and Terry assured her no such thing would happen. They finally got home, finding Terry's bowl of sweats empty and his front porch covered in dried yolks. They collapsed onto his steps, Lucy slouching to the deck out cold. Terry rubbed his aching knees as Mary plopped down next to him, leaning sweetly on his shoulders.

""Bloody knees are killing me."" he mumbled.

""Know how ya feel. Think I threw my back out juggling pumpkin men."" She laughed. ""And that sap isn't gonna set well in the morning."" She grimaced.

""Ah you're young, you'll be in top shape in no time."" He waved.

""I'm not that spry Terry. And you're not that decrepit."" She teased.

""In my glory days, I would have slapped Jack around I tell you that much, would have ran circles around his little pumpkin patch."" he boasted.

""You also said you smashed lanterns and were so much of a general prick that it pissed him off to begin with."" She noted. Terry sat in silence for a moment, while Lucy loudly snored next to them.

""Well-Young Terry was an asshole."" he finally admitted.

""Young Terry sounds like a guy I'd avoid like the plague."" Mary said, sinking into him. ""I like Old Terry."" The pair enjoyed each other in silence for a while longer, enjoying the beautify evening before them. They spent the right of the night with each other, only climbing out of bed to help a dazed, retching Lucy crawl her way to the Bathroom.

All in all, Terry had certainly had worse Halloweens, and as he laid in bed, an adoring woman wrapped around his chest, he couldn't think of anywhere else he'd rather be.",1,1761511092.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

There's a caf√© in the Union Square subway station that exists in a strange liminal space. It's not quite underground, not quite street level just a small counter wedged between the N/Q/R platform and the stairs leading up to 14th Street. The coffee is surprisingly decent. The seating is four wobbly tables that seem designed to make you leave quickly.

I'd suggested it because it was ""convenient."" What I really meant was: low stakes, easy escape route, plausible deniability if things went badly.

Her name was Maya. We'd been messaging on Bumble for **two weeks** the kind of conversation that felt effortless in text. She made jokes about her failed attempts at sourdough. I told her about the time I accidentally joined a Finnish folk dancing class. We talked about books we'd never finish and movies we pretended to understand.

Meeting in person felt inevitable and terrifying in equal measure.

She arrived seven minutes late, apologizing before she even sat down. The photos were accurate, which shouldn't have felt like a victory but somehow did. She ordered a cappuccino and immediately got foam on her nose, which she didn't notice for a full thirty seconds. I didn't tell her. I liked that she didn't immediately check her reflection.

The conversation started well. We fell into the same rhythm we'd had over text  easy, quick, punctuated by the kind of laughter that makes other people glance over. She told me about her roommate's terrible boyfriend. I told her about my friend's worse one. We debated whether the L train shutdown had actually improved anyone's life or just redistributed misery across Brooklyn.

**Fifteen minutes in**, I thought: *This is going well. This is actually going well.*

Then my brain betrayed me.

I don't know exactly when the panic started. Maybe it was when she leaned forward and her eyes caught the fluorescent light in a way that made everything feel suddenly too real. Maybe it was when I realized I was actually enjoying myself, and that enjoyment felt dangerous somehow. Maybe it was just the accumulated weight of every other first date that had promised something and delivered nothing.

Whatever it was, I felt it rising that familiar tightness in my chest, the sudden awareness of my own heartbeat, the sensation that the walls of this tiny subway caf√© were closing in.

She was in the middle of a story about her sister's wedding when I interrupted her.

""I'm so sorry, I just realized  I have to go.""

She stopped mid-sentence. ""Oh. Is everything okay""

""Yeah, yeah, totally fine. I just... I forgot I have this thing. This work thing. I'm really sorry.""

It was **2:47 on a Saturday afternoon**. There was no work thing.

I watched her face do something complicated  confusion, then hurt, then a kind of resigned understanding that made everything worse. She knew. Of course she knew.

""Sure,"" she said quietly. ""No problem.""

I stood up too quickly and knocked my cup, sending a small wave of lukewarm coffee across the table. We both reached for napkins. Our hands touched for half a second, and I pulled back like I'd been burned.

""This was nice,"" I said, which was true and also the most inadequate sentence I could have chosen.

""Yeah,"" she said, not looking at me anymore. ""It was.""

I walked toward the stairs, then stopped at the turnstile. I could see her still sitting there, staring at her phone, probably already texting her friends about the guy who literally ran away. I swiped my MetroCard, went through, and kept walking.

On the train, I composed and deleted seven different messages.

*""I'm sorry, I panicked.""* Too honest.

*""Something actually did come up.""* Too dishonest.

*""Can we try again""* Too presumptuous.

I sent nothing.

Three days later, she unmatched me. I didn't blame her.

I wish I could tell you this story has a redemptive ending. That I ran back and found her still there. That I sent the perfect message and we laughed about it over a real dinner, somewhere above ground with actual chairs. That we're together now, telling people about our chaotic first meeting at a subway caf√©.

But this is what actually happened: I panicked. I ran. I hurt someone who didn't deserve it. And I learned that the hardest part of connection isn't finding it  it's staying present when you do.

I still take the N train through Union Square. I still see that caf√©. Sometimes I stop and get coffee there, sitting at one of those wobbly tables, practicing the art of staying put. Not because I think I'll see Maya again I won't but because I'm trying to teach myself that good things don't always require an escape route.

The bench has room for messy stories too. The ones where we don't show up as our best selves. Where we run when we should stay. Where we learn the lesson too late to fix what we broke.

Maybe you've been Maya in your story. Maybe you've been me. Maybe you've been both, on different days.

Either way, I hope next time you stay.

I hope I do too.",0,1761511053.0,Bumble,6,0.15,False

1ogv7bi,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1ogv7bi/my_story/,My story.,"I don‚Äôt know where to begin. I guess I would like to start by saying I hope you don‚Äôt think this is ChatGPT. This is ALOT, and if you know anything about the military industrial complex, the global surveillance network, and the growth of a Snowden-esque Orwellian dystopia, I‚Äôm hoping you consider this account and provide any helpful feedback you safely can. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm looking for. I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôve decided finally post this. Most people won‚Äôt believe it.
And If that‚Äôs the case well, I guess, fuck you. 

I suppose the beginning starts with the kind of person I used to be. I was a bad guy. I stole from people, I was a drug addict, hung around in circles that attracted the wrong kind of attention and made choices that fit the metric of a low life. And I guess the key take away from this is that I‚Äôve gotten away with most of it. You know? I was very slimy. Enemies were made. I certainly made it onto one or two people‚Äòs lists, so to speak. I‚Äôm not proud of it and this isn‚Äôt a confession. Just helping you understand, if you‚Äôve never lived that kind of life. Circumstances be damned, a son of a bitch can‚Äôt help how he‚Äôs born. A lying son of a bitch makes a choice.

In 2018, I relocated to Texas to stay with family and try to get my head out of my ass. Brought my dope addiction with me, and ended up being a blight in their life and household. One day about a month after moving in, I‚Äôm accused of a crime I didn‚Äôt commit. In hindsight, I learned that the coercive tactics and the blatantly unethical threats that led to my signing out of plea deal rather than risk being locked away for 20 years were more common than people realize, kind of opened my eyes to the idea of the prison nation conspiracy, etc. Anyway, I signed for time and served six years in Texas prison for something I didn‚Äôt do. If you‚Äôve come to the same conclusions that I did, it‚Äôs not hard to believe that given the lack of evidence of true guilt, law-enforcement, fabricated, a crime in order to finally put me in my place. But that‚Äôs not what this is about. It‚Äôs simply a part of it. Let‚Äôs put a pin in it for now.

Fast-forward to 2024, and my release in Dallas, Texas. The first thing that I need people to understand is how this was executed and why it‚Äôs significant. I‚Äôm required by law to have ID on me. There is a reentry process for all soon to be released inmates in the Texas prison system that is supposed to provide you with any documentation you need in order to get a place to live a job, etc.. your ID, Social Security card and birth certificate. I was given none of these documents. Furthermore, it stands to reason that a felon should be given a place to stay or found some halfway house to live in and that didn‚Äôt happen either. I was released under the street with a shirt, a pair of pants and a bag full of my discharge documents. For the first three months I was out I was living on the street. Enter Tyson, the first person that simply didn‚Äôt make sense.

The story, as told to me, was that during a church fundraiser that I attended as a homeless person needing help, I met a man who I had a conversation with that passed my name and phone number along to this gentleman because he believed he could help me. While I was inside, I discovered a passion for theology and spiritualism. When I got out, I took that ideology and passion with me. So you can imagine my surprise when, as if by some miracle, I was called on the night that I decided I was going to go to the top of the freeway overpass and jump off by a man I‚Äôve never met. I‚Äôm mean my feet were literally hanging off the edge, cars driving by 80 miles an hour, and my phone starts to buzz. A phone I chose to steal because of my circumstances, to be clear. I lived on stolen French bread from Walmart for about three months. Sorry if that offends you.

Anyway, this guy says that he got my number from someone I met at that church function and that he wanted to help me. In that moment, I felt like it was God and I began to cry as he said he wanted to buy me a Greyhound ticket to get closer to his town, where he believes he can find me somewhere to live. I tell him I don‚Äôt even have money to get to the bus station downtown and he buys me a fucking Uber. So I go. I mean, what else was there?

I ride a bus up to Texarkana Texas and I meet this total stranger named Tyson who tells me he just really loves Jesus and that he felt compelled to help and we drive around for three hours looking for like a motel room or something for me to stay in while we find me like a halfway house. I‚Äôm crying and just snot covered from my emotions and gratitude, and he gets in touch with a friend who has another associate that apparently owns this farm in a town called Detroit, Texas, that serves as like a halfway-house sort of institution for men recently released from prison. They live there and they work there to pay their rent and make a small living and then move out when it serves them right. The man that owns the farm and conducts this little program is a man named Calvin Burgess and he‚Äôs a billionaire. Look him up, no shit. At the time he behaves like he doesn‚Äôt know me, like this is all some big surprise, like he‚Äôs going out on a limb to help me out. Stick with me here if you‚Äôve stuck it out this far. I‚Äôm about to tell you some seriously sinister shit. 
A second key point I would like to make here is it when I moved in there I didn‚Äôt cause any trouble. I started working and started paying my rent, started saving money, didn‚Äôt relapse, didn‚Äôt even drink with the guys there that snuck alcohol, just worked and watched Amazon Prime Video. And so one day you‚Äôll understand my surprise when I am kicked out because I‚Äôm wearing a wallet chain to work. That‚Äôs it. Calvin sees me, tells me it‚Äôs a safety hazard and that I‚Äôm simply unwilling to follow rules, and kicks me out onto the street. Detroit is so small that there‚Äôs no place for someone like me to stay, the only other town for two hours is a town called Paris. No shit. And this where the story officially begins.

So I have about $800 in my pocket for money I‚Äôve saved and everything I own on my back and I begin staying at a motel. At this time, I‚Äôm exceptionally religious. I‚Äôm also somewhat obnoxious about it, not private or quiet and that probably didn‚Äôt do me any favors. I‚Äôm also really devastated by this horrible turn of events and because of that I relapse. Only for about two weeks, but it was enough to really open my eyes to just what I was about to go back to. And so in a bit of guilt I go to church on Sunday with something like $30 left in my pocket, I sit in the back and I just cry. This man, about four rows up and sitting with his family gets up at some point walks over to me and asks me if I want any prayer. Once again I take this is some sort of divine intervention and just spill my beans. He tells me, lo and behold, he might just be able to help! And he gets me in touch with this man, a very important man in the story, named Heath. You see Heath and his son, Justus, live about two hours away in rusk, but work here in town during the week as independent subcontractors and cable lineman repairmen for the largest competitor to AT&T in 150 miles. And would you believe that this guy Heath, who‚Äôs never met me and knows nothing about me except that I don‚Äôt have an ID and can‚Äôt prove my identity and that I claim to be a felon, why he lets me move into his spare bedroom and gives me a job working for him under the table. And he doesn‚Äôt just let me move in. He lets me move in while he‚Äôs out of town on vacation. So this guy from a church that I‚Äôve only been to once and I‚Äôve never met. Got me in touch with this other guy who knows nothing about me except that I‚Äôm a felon and they give me a home and a job after about 20 minutes hard deliberation. And I stay there for about six days while they‚Äôre out of town, eating their food and shitting in their toilet. 

No, I know what some of you are thinking, especially the more reverent conspiracists. This asshole is super ungrateful. What a thing to be given all of these wonderful blessings and think that they are somehow some evil plot. But that‚Äôs the thing. 
I didn‚Äôt.

I thought they were a family. I thought they were a home. And for a good while it seemed that way. Then after finding my own job, I decided to move out and begin to stay in a motel. The connection and friendship that I shared with these people began to disappear, as those connections sometimes do. 

And it was about this time that I noticed I was being followed. 

It was a non-descript pick up truck with very tinted windows. Once again in hindsight, the strange behaviors and patterns that I began noticing, were the common surveillance patterns used by federal agents and unnecessary to be described here. Before anyone comes back with the ‚Äúwell, you‚Äôll never see them watching you,‚Äù fuck that. These are just people that make mistakes, same as anyone else. It does you no good to mythologize them, so please don‚Äôt waste my time. So what I did was what I think any reasonable human being would do. I started recording them. I started taking photographic evidence. And I started reporting it to the police. Four times I reported it, providing evidence of images and video, and four times they blew me off. When the videos and images became better and more concise, it seems to me they even became almost hostile. There was something big happening that I didn‚Äôt know anything about. But I was starting to see it. And it was at this time that my phone first got hacked. 

For those of you that don‚Äôt know, there once was a guy named Edward Snowden, who revealed a whole bunch of information about the state level surveillance employed on American citizens that was enough to get him expatriated to Russia, and the capacity for employing what are called zero day exploits on any cell phone is nothing short of horrifying. Go down that rabbit hole at your own discretion. Google fusion centers. Seriously.

Anyway, I‚Äôm sitting in my motel room one morning and I go to turn on my phone screen, and it has some kind of strange border around it as if the screen has been minimized by a quarter of an inch, and there is a mouse cursor, manipulating the screen for about a half a second before the screen goes black. Then it comes back on looking normally. And the images that I had taken of one of the vehicles that had been following me had all been purged. Obviously, I begin to research this subject, and my phone begins to act as if it doesn‚Äôt have Internet. I have to constantly break connection with the motel Internet service, constantly transferring back-and-forth between my data and the Internet service at the motel to get pages to load and information to appear, but I come to the conclusion that my phone has been cloned, or it‚Äôs IMEI number had been, and was being manipulated by someone. The things that I was seeing on my phone would terrify you, like apps like Facebook having administrator permission over do not disturb and airplane mode, meaning I couldn‚Äôt turn it off because it was ‚Äúgrayed out‚Äù and that I could not control if it got turned on or off. So what do I do? I go to buy a new phone, of course. This is where things get really weird. 

I look up a couple of things about going to buy a phone and immediately leave my motel room to go to the nearest Dollar General and purchase one of the prepaid phones there. When I get there, there is only one brand of foam stocked on the shelves for the first time ever, as if all the other brands had sold out. I‚Äôm already on edge and think this is weird so I decide to walk further down the street to the Family Dollar.. and the same thing there. They only had a Verizon phone for sale, at both stores. And wouldn‚Äôt you know it? That‚Äôs the only store in more miles than I could walk. So I buy a Verizon phone while the tall muscular, bald white guy (who must not have been able to find what he needed at the Dollar General we were both just at either) watches me quietly in line and then I go to the Verizon store to get it set up with a real human being. There are three things I noticed when I first walk inside. First is that there is a young lady ending what seems to be a very serious, very private conversation with the manager as I walk in. Second being that the manager and one other employee are there. Third being that the other employee is sitting at a desk with a Post-it note on the desk in front of him. The lady finishes her conversation with manager woman and then walks out. I explain to the young man that I believe there is something wrong with my phone and that I want to transfer my number over to a new one and ask him to help me set it up. He says no problem. Upon getting out all of the contents of my prepaid phone, he set aside the SIM card and and IMEI number that came with the phone and proceeds to try and put in the number that was located on the Post-it note when I walk in. I ask him just what the hell he thinks he‚Äôs doing and he explains to me that because of some authorized retailer hangup, blah blah blah, the only way he would be able to activate my phone is with the IMEI number of someone‚Äôs trade-in that he had written down from earlier. Obviously, I feel like this is some strange ass shit but because I don‚Äôt feel like I have any other choice, I decide to relent. And then I go home and obviously my phone begins to behave in the same manner as the one I had just gotten rid of. So I look it up.

Your phone is protected under probable cause. Violation of that is a violation of your fourth amendment right. An IMEI number is like a key to a house. In short, not only was what they did illegal, it was extremely unethical and a direct and blunt violation of my privacy. 

So I called Verizon at 8:30 the next morning sitting in front of the Verizon store before it opened. I recorded a phone call between myself and a Verizon agent stating everything that I have just said to you. Then I hung up, took out my phone and began to record video. Today, the manager woman from last night is there along with a new manager, apparently a general manager. The woman looks like she could shit a brick as I walk up to the general manager and begin to question her about last night event. And boy Howdy does she act mad. I mean, she just makes a whole show about how that is just incredibly wrong and it will never happen again and she‚Äôs just so sorry and that she was going to pay for my next month service. And I said no I don‚Äôt think that will work. Just set my phone back up with the IMEI number that was located with it in the original packaging and there would be no issue. It was at this point that she completely changed her tone and began to be combative, refusing to do what I asked. So I revealed that I‚Äôm recording her and she calls the police and has me trespassed from the store. Obviously I make another report about everything that‚Äôs happened and explain to the police the seriousness of violating someone‚Äôs privacy, even if it‚Äôs just a phone. I then called Verizon and left a report with someone who promised to call me back and then never did. My phone was still being hacked. 

It was at this point that I began to exhibit behavior that could have been perceived as instability by the people around me. I was genuinely terrified. Something was happening, and I really didn‚Äôt understand the full depth of it. But I carried on recording what I could photographing what I could. Shortly thereafter, everything changed.

One night a few weeks later, I was walking home from a friend‚Äôs house, on edge and paranoid. The thing you need to understand about Paris, Texas, is that it‚Äôs a true American small town. Two major roads, and east in the west, in the north and the south. I combined total of maybe 15 traffic lights. When I say that it has its way of doing things, I don‚Äôt say it lightly. It was Thursday afternoon at about 930 at night, and I was walking up Main Street, which was the main north and south Road. It‚Äôs populated with a number of different restaurants and gas stations and probably sees 10,000 cars a day. One of the gas stations is a 24 hour location, as well as the Whataburger further on, and everything else is pretty well open until midnight as it was. I had a good relationship with a couple of the clerks at the gas station and the aforementioned dollar store, and so you must understand my surprise when I walked out on Main Street and every single light on the street turned off. Every businesses lights turned off. The gas station pump lights turned off. The liquor store, the Mexican restaurant, the automotive store, a whole 3/4 of a mile and a majority of the main thoroughfare of town was just closed at 9:30 at night on a Thursday. Three of the same vehicles were driving down the road. Back-and-forth. Back-and-forth. i‚Äôm starting to think I think I‚Äôm in the fucking twilight zone when I walk in to the parking lot of the gas station and up to the window where all the lights are off inside, but the woman who I‚Äôve known for a year to work, there is standing behind the counter in silence and darkness. I start regretting all the Stephen King books I‚Äôve ever read. I start second-guessing all the skepticism I have regarding cults and fucking robots. Fucking twin Pines man. I keep walking down the street seeing the same thing everywhere. At the very end is the main hospital in town. I literally feel like this is the only option and I walk inside. When I walk in, everyone goes silent. When I walk up to the triage nurse, I get this feeling like I can‚Äôt even describe, like I am in mortal danger. I take a piece of paper. I sit down. But when I fill it out, I put down false information. Tell the lady that I don‚Äôt have my ID when I hand the paper back to her, and she simply looks at it, stands up, and walks out of the room. 30 seconds pass and she comes back to her desk, sits down and says, have a seat ‚Äúsir‚Äù. So I do. And as soon as I do, a man burst through the door, she just used wearing a white lab coat, chuckling, and holding my triage paper in his fucking hand. I follow him out as the triage nurse calls after me. I take down his license plate and a picture of his vehicle as he speeds out of the parking lot and into the night. What proceeded afterward was the most terrifying experience of my life, trying to get back to my motel room and inside before any vehicle could pull up on me that had been out pacing the road that night. The same three vehicles with heavily tinted windows. Up and down the main thoroughfare with all of the traffic lights in the street lamps off, like a power outage. The employees standing inside in the dark. I don‚Äôt care if you don‚Äôt believ. I pushed the dresser in front of my door and slept in my bathtub. 

A few days later, I encounter somebody at my door i haven‚Äôt seen in a long time and owed me almost $200, apologizing profusely and trying to give me $400 and some drugs. I tell him to just throw them away for all I care. He chuckles as he walks away, saying that it really sucked. I was in this room with the history of it. I asked him what he meant. He said that the feds had used it to run sting operations in the past, as he walks around the corner and out of sight. 

This led to my bottom, I guess. I was without sleep and terrified. They had come into my room and left rat feces on my bed while I was gone, and I had honestly justified it up and to that point. I decided enough was enough. And I confronted the hotel owner, someone I have been doing good business with for almost 6 months. He told me that I had to leave. He said that he didn‚Äôt want any trouble from ‚Äúthese people.‚Äù he would not elaborate. So once again, I‚Äôm on the street with a small handful of money and no options. Having been out of prison now without any issues on my part for over a year for this to be happening. I go to the dollar store. They asked me to leave and tell me that I‚Äôve been trespassed. I‚Äôm standing on the corner and would you believe my savior came along again in the form of a woman who just happened to know a guy who just happened to need a roommate at this house just happened to be a felon. Also in this house 18 miles from town And that he just happened to say I could move in then and there. Are you guys seeing the pattern here now? Cool. 

I move in. And guess who my neighbors are? ALL OF THE MEN WHO LIVED AT THE HALFWAY HOUSE I GOT KICKED OUT OUT OF. Apparently it closed right after I left in some horrible tragic turn of events. So they all moved out here. To the exact same road. And now I‚Äôm here too. In the same thing that happened at the halfway house farm thing happened here. People would accuse me of things that didn‚Äôt happen. I couldn‚Äôt get along with my roommate and had to move into a trailer alongside his house by myself. Nobody would talk to me and there was this strange video camera pointed at my home at all times that my landlord swore was a security camera. For weeks, the trailer didn‚Äôt have running water and was infested with rats. I still paid my rent. 

And one day I decided I was fed up. I decided I was gonna move out of state and started to tell people and make preparations. And one day, my phone began to get hacked so badly that I couldn‚Äôt even use it and had to walk 18 miles to town to report it to the police. I had already purchased my bus ticket. I had already informed my landlord. I was leaving. My phone wouldn‚Äôt even turn on. Wouldn‚Äôt even allow me to get to the bus tickets I had purchased. I went to the police and I reported it, had them take pictures, showed it to them. I showed them that my Facebook app had access to do not disturb and that I could not even turn it off and they acted like it was just some strange hacking thing. But I make a report this time regarding it in particular. A police report about my phone being violated. Then I go and meet some stranger from Facebook marketplace and purchase a phone in a parking lot of the gas station and I go home. While im sitting there, I‚Äôm really on edge and frustrated about what is going on. So I asked one of my neighbors to go get a burger with me and tell him I‚Äôm paying. We‚Äôre gone maybe two hours and when we get back, my phone, the one that was hacked, was gone from where it was hidden under under the microwave. Nothing else had been disturbed. My music equipment wasn‚Äôt gone. The door was locked when I got back. They came in, took it and left. So I immediately called the police and report it. They come out there and do a half ass job of filing some sort of report and don‚Äôt make any mention of the obvious implications of it being missing so shortly after my having made a report. Then they leave. 

Later that night at 1 AM I get a message on Facebook from a total stranger, asking me why I added them as a friend. I told them that I didn‚Äôt put immediately realize what had happened and check my bank account and emails. I didn‚Äôt honestly think that they could get past the Lock Screen, which was probably stupid on my part. Anyway, I have an email that was sent 15 minutes after the cops had left my place hours earlier saying that my android device had been logged onto and then flagged because of the suspicious geographic nature. It noted the device and its location ping when the attempt was made. I report this to the police only assuming the worst, because the woman that messaged me appeared to be of suspicious age. I then live basically a hermit‚Äôs life for the next few days until my bus. More suspicious events occurred, but it bears no need for elaboration. Everyone around me seems to be involved. I get to the bus station a few days later. Obviously I get there early because of the unreliability of greyhound buses. But while I‚Äôm sitting at this, no account gas station in bum fuck Texarkana, I have an encounter with a couple who recited an entire conversation I had the day before on the phone to each other standing behind me in line, chuckling quietly as if in on some joke, and two other people I‚Äôve never met in my life, approach me and threaten me. Warned me about the dangers of going over the state line. I get on the bus a complete mess. 

During that last week prior to my departure,, the hacking on my phone was the worst. I decided to reach out to the ACLU, decided to start trying to get in touch with an attorney. Someone was trying to implicate me for a crime, they had already violated my due process, and at that point I had to believe my fourth amendment right. You must understand what I‚Äôm saying by saying that third one. But I recorded a couple of conversations in which the answering operators of these legal firms sounded like AI. So on a hunch, I decided to begin testing them and made some very incriminating footage and screen recording of them basically using AI to redirect my calls and impersonate legal aid. I‚Äôm not fucking kidding. This has become common scamming practice these days. I‚Äôm sure you have an RFID blocking wallet. Every time I tried to send an email my Internet would turn off. I had to keep my phone plugged in almost at all times because it got so hot and the battery ran so heavily, something I did not seem to be able to mitigate. 

I decided that I was going to go to a rescue mission in a different state and do the discipleship program that they offered there. In looking for a bus, however, I noticed something strange happening. No matter which direction I took the only options available for tickets on greyhound had me going over the state line and into Oklahoma. I‚Äôve never been to Oklahoma. But when I go on greyhound and I see that the only tickets to Houston take a small 300 mile fucking detour north (the opposite direction) into Oklahoma, the only tickets to Florida to Las Cruces, to Denver,  to Dallas, to LA all go through the same two hour layaway in Oklahoma. I realize something is up. and wouldn‚Äôt you know it? When I call my friend and have them book a ticket they see a completely different list available where none of these little Oklahoma detours happen. So they booked me a trip. I get on the bus and I head to El Paso. I have a transfer there. Totally normal station experience, except that The bus station has some kind of bomb threat and closes two hours early. They literally have no ability to tell us that our bus has miraculously broken down on its way to get us. Almost miss it. Oh, and I met someone who said he was Q. Like, THE Q. Going on a hiking trip over the border into Mexico, a pilgrimage that he goes on when he‚Äôs not apparently  fighting the global pedophile cabal. He was an incredibly intelligent, charismatic, perceptive human being. And then I do miss my next transfer because of this delay. I have to have a friend book another ticket, because everything I can find on greyhound goes through Texas and up through Oklahoma to my destination in Wyoming. She doesn‚Äôt see any of these however, only normal sensible schedules without absurd 300 mile detours. And after all of that hell I finally get to the rescue mission. I enroll in the program. When I get to Cheyenne, there is a fucking logistics company based in Oklahoma bringing a whole bunch of houses from Texas to Casper, the town I‚Äôm headed to. I know it isn‚Äôt over.

I keep taking pictures and videos. And the very worst of all happens. And this is exactly how it happens. For anybody still reading this and not a bot, sheep, or fucking spook, this is why I think it has to be a psyop. 

One night as I‚Äôm sitting in the lounge at the mission, the emergency broadcast system comes on the television. And the most peculiar and cryptic message I have ever heard is broadcast. It sounds like complete nonsense. Not a random string of words. Just a couple of random sentences. I am so genuinely afraid at this point that I‚Äôm not going to disclose the words here. But it wasn‚Äôt just the words, but the manner in which they were stated. The inflection. Almost teasing, like the news anchor in that scene from The Game with Michael Douglas and Sean Penn. And I wasn‚Äôt the only one that heard it, and the guy who heard it with me walks outside to smoke a cigarette behind me when I do. Then the emergency broadcast ends and the TV show continues. He doesn‚Äôt act like it‚Äôs odd at all. When I‚Äôm outside i start talking about it, certainly raving, going on about conspiracies and secret messages when this guy (who claims to have been in private security before ‚Äúlosing their contract‚Äù) smoking a cigarette with me and begins to have a very serious conversation with me about the importance of my thinking. I realize the truth about him and I tell him in no uncertain terms that I refuse to be a sheep. 

That‚Äôs when I heard the sirens. Right then.

His name was Nate. They said he had a brain aneurysm and was standing at the urinal inside. That he died instantly. He had no family, no one to miss him, But the guy that I had been having a conversation with and one other person who apparently used to work in private security with him and also lives there, walks into the room, where I‚Äôm sitting thinking about who it might be (they said at the desk we‚Äôre not allowed to know at that time), and begin to joke about the fact that Nate was the third one they had seen just drop dead in the time that they had lived there.

They said it was uncanny how the three of them had just not wanted to change their thinking. Then they both turned in the dark and stared at me where I was sitting.

At this point, I seriously thought I needed to check myself into a hospital. I was starting to question my own sanity. So I tell the desk I‚Äôve decided to do so. My discipleship coordinator tells me I am not allowed. I tell him I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôm unsafe and he says he doesn‚Äôt care. You‚Äôve got to understand the kind of fear that comes from being told by someone like that, this mentor in church, then I‚Äôm not allowed to check myself into a hospital when I need help. He got it angry with me and hung up. I tell him I‚Äôm doing it anyway and he calls the police, probably thinking I wouldn‚Äôt go if I had to go in the back of the police car. He was wrong. So they take me to this hospital that has what‚Äôs called a no locked door policy. Basically if you check yourself in and you don‚Äôt say suicidal or homicidal, they let you leave when you want. I check myself in. I come to grips with things. I even get a physical to make sure everything‚Äôs all right under the hood. The mission sends me a formal letter saying that I‚Äôve been refused to be allowed to come back and would not tell me why other than that I refused in order and ‚Äúself-diagnosed.‚Äù I was no longer allowed to return to the mission to complete My discipleship program. 

One day, someone there stands behind me in the kitchen and act as if they are going to hit me over the back of the head with a ceramic coffee cup. I only noticed this because of the nod that the ATTENDANT SUBTLY GAVE HIM. Who was standing in there watching us alone instead of with her partner, strangely absent for the first time. I turned to see him holding a cup by the mouth, thumb looped in the handle. I got in his face. Nothing happened and I checked out. I told no one where I was going, and moved out of state again. A month ago, I called there to inquire about the bill and the results of my blood test in physical. There was no record of my having been there. I apparently owe them nothing at all for almost 3 weeks treatment. And when I lost the town of Casper Wyoming for the last time, it was three hours late. 
Because the bus had broken down on the way there.

The implications I‚Äôve presented are all factual. The town of Paris, Texas, that fucking Disney Channel twilight zone nightmare really exists. The fact that the mental wellness institution scrubbed my inpatient time and bloodwork from record, a religious mission that may be implicitly involved in murder, the systematic staging of my entire life for the last two years. I can give you a plethora of specific detailed evidence and information that I have stored on a DEMS (digital evidence management system) that I pay for, 14 gigs court admissible evidence of everything I‚Äôve been through. I think this is it. THE conspiracy, so to speak. The only one that really matters. 

And then there was the obvious manipulation using my religious beliefs and personal friendships.

I guess I‚Äôm trying to find where to go from here. I can only assume that I‚Äôm being investigated for something I haven‚Äôt done, at the least. But I think it might be something  more sinister. I‚Äôve been on the West Coast a few months now. This is the first time I‚Äôve told my whole story. No, I don‚Äôt know all the players. No, I don‚Äôt know the whole picture. I‚Äôve told you what I know and am willing to risk disclosing. Any info from any person to help me bring clarity to what I‚Äôm assuming is the most advanced, invasive, clandestine surveillance network imaginable would be appreciated. Prepare for me to respond to my own post though. For any person reading this that is involved in the systematic torture that I have survived over a year now, I hope you know I will never stop now. 

And for those who don‚Äôt believe me, again, go fuck yourself a lovely day.

Again, this is a FREE service.¬† I will not ask for nor accept any type of fee.¬† I will not accept any type of gift.¬† I will not even accept a coffee. ¬†**This service is 100% Pro Bono.**¬† My goal is to help out the parents I watched get trampled by Special Education Administrators.¬† These Special Education administrators have purposely inflicted pain into the lives of our most vulnerable children.

If you need help, send me a DM and I will contact you with an email address to get the process started.¬†

Can anyone rec a dark cocoa powder similar to the Hersheys special dark? I enjoy baking with it and especially using it in my iced coffee, I‚Äôve tried using the regular cocoa but it‚Äôs just not the same. My understanding is supply issues etc. Someone had posted that you can find the special dark on Amazon but that was a while ago now, it‚Äôs no longer available. Thank you!

1ogv0hk,https://i.redd.it/nmevcuiwmixf1.jpeg,First pourover! Tips needed please :),"Hi! This is my first pourover with the medium roast blend ""hologram"". I liked it, but I found it a tad weak with a bit of a sour aftertaste. When it cooled down more I tasted the chocolate and fruity note. Does anyone know how to detect the ""syrupy"" or more specific flavors? I've been drinking pourovers for a little while now and I'm pretty psyched to start making them! 

Recipe:

Medium fine grind (texture of table salt)
50g bloom over 45 seconds
50g every 20 seconds after until 250g

1oguz19,https://www.reddit.com/r/OntarioHomeRenovation/comments/1oguz19/which_smarthome_upgrades_now_earn_insurance/,Which Smart-Home Upgrades Now Earn Insurance Discounts for Ontario Homeowners?,"# The renewal-quote gut-punch that pushed me into the Internet of Things

In January my home-insurance renewal arrived sandwiched between holiday credit-card bills. Premium up, deductible up, nothing else changed. I phoned my broker ready to argue, but she surprised me: *‚ÄúInstall a leak-detection system and a monitored smoke sensor, send photos, and most carriers will shave a chunk off that bill.‚Äù* I‚Äôd heard rumours of smart-home discounts but assumed they were pennies. One coffee-fueled evening later I discovered multiple Ontario insurers now publish **formal rebate tables** for specific connected devices‚Äîand the savings are big enough to offset hardware in the first policy year. The post below is the field guide I wish existed: what devices actually qualify in 2025, which companies pay up, and how to avoid the paperwork sinkhole.

*(Key sources sprinkled throughout‚Äîfrom Intact, Northbridge, Surex, City News, and the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada.)*

# Why insurers suddenly love your Wi-Fi gadgets

1. **Water damage is Canada‚Äôs #1 claim driver.** Insurers paid **billions** in flooded-basement and burst-pipe losses over the past decade, so leak-prevention tech is their new darling.
2. **Theft severity plateaued.** Traditional burglary alarms already earn discounts; insurers broadened criteria to lure smart-camera adopters.
3. **Data-driven underwriting.** IoT devices feed anonymized risk stats (temperature excursions, minor leaks, off-prime occupancy) back to carriers, refining premiums.

FCIQ briefing: *‚ÄúSmart Home Security Slashes Insurance Costs‚Äù* (March 2025) ‚Äî [https://www.fciq.ca/uncategorized/smart-home-security-slashes-insurance-costs-what-homeowners-need-to-know/](https://www.fciq.ca/uncategorized/smart-home-security-slashes-insurance-costs-what-homeowners-need-to-know/)

# The 2025 discount-eligible device roster (Ontario consensus)

|Device category|Typical examples|% of surveyed insurers offering a discount\*|Why carriers like it|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Smart leak detection & auto-shutoff**|Eddy IQ, Flo by Moen, Phyn Plus|‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ|Prevents large-loss claims; Northbridge‚Äôs Onyx program supplies Eddy systems free [https://www.northbridgeinsurance.ca/personal-insurance/onyx/](https://www.northbridgeinsurance.ca/personal-insurance/onyx/)|
|**Monitored smoke/CO detector**|Google Nest Protect (with pro monitoring), Kidde SmartSmoke|‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ|Early fire alerts cut structural loss, preserve life|
|**Smart security system (intrusion + cameras)**|Ring Alarm Pro, Abode, Telus SmartHome|‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ|Reduces theft/vandalism payouts; must be professionally or self-monitored with event logs|
|**Smart thermostat + freeze alert**|Ecobee SmartThermostat (Toronto-born!), Honeywell T9|‚òÖ‚òÖ|Lowers frozen-pipe risk, minor energy savings|
|**Smart door lock / garage sensor**|August Wi-Fi Smart Lock, MyQ Garage Hub|‚òÖ|Still emerging; some underwriters counting it in ‚Äúhome security bundle‚Äù|

Fine print: discounts stack with traditional ones (multi-policy, new-build) but cap at each insurer‚Äôs maximum total credit.

# Installing my own ‚Äúdiscount bundle‚Äù‚Äîa basement-tested walkthrough

# A) Gear I chose

* **Eddy H2o+ mainline shut-off** (local Toronto vendor).
* **Nest Protect (hard-wired)** x2.
* **Ecobee SmartThermostat** with SmartSensor in crawl space.

# B) Permit & trade hiccups

* Toronto plumbing permit not required for inline shut-off since no pipe reroute, but the certified plumber still filed an ESA notification for the 24 V transformer.
* Insurance asked for plumber‚Äôs license number; selfie with shut-off wasn‚Äôt enough.

# C) App activation proof

Screenshots had to show *‚ÄúConnected‚Äù* status and my home address. Intact portal accepted JPEG uploads; broker confirmed credit at next renewal.

# Numbers without the lawsuit‚Äîhow the discount maths out

Live premium figures vary by dwelling value and claims history, so let‚Äôs use **ratio logic**:

* My smart-water system cost ‚âà *one* monthly premium chunk.
* Advertised discount slice ‚âà *fraction* of annual premium.
* **Break-even**: well within two years, and the device stands guard long after.

FCIQ‚Äôs March report cites up to ‚Äú20 % premium differential‚Äù with multi-sensor adoption; Surex quotes ‚Äú5‚Äì15 %‚Äù for security bundles.

# Side-benefits & quirks the brochure won‚Äôt tell you

|Experience|Reality check|
|:-|:-|
|**False alarm anxiety**|First week the leak sensor screamed at condensation on new heat-pump water heater. Tweaked threshold; fine since.|
|**Privacy worries**|*not*Insurers get proof of install,   live data‚Äîunless you sign pilot participation. Read the consent box.|
|**Home resale bump**|Realtors now mention smart leak systems in listings; minor but differentiates against comparable comps.|
|**Energy tie-in**|Ecobee‚Äôs eco+ program already earned me Ontario PeakSaver points‚Äîdouble dip on utility side.|

# DIY vs professional install‚Äîdoes it matter for discount?

* **Water shut-off valves** *must* be pro-installed for most insurers; DIY voids warranty and discount.
* **Smart thermostats, smoke detectors** usually fine DIY; just follow CSA wiring guidelines.
* **Alarm/security** require 24/7 monitoring company if you want maximum credit.

# Future roadmap‚Äîwhat devices may join the list by 2026?

1. **AI-driven electrical fire-prevent sensors** (e.g., Ting).
2. **Smart sump-pump monitors**‚ÄîOntario flood insurance losses keep climbing.
3. **Whole-home air-quality monitors**; wildfire smoke events in 2023 nudged insurers to explore health-adjacent risk scoring.

# Now your stories‚Äîbecause one broker‚Äôs advice ‚â† crowd truth

* Which insurer actually honoured the discount without a renewal fight?
* Any smart-device claim where data logs helped you get paid faster?
* Privacy nerds: did you negotiate data-sharing limitations?

I can't believe how *terribly* the Falcons played ‚Äì my god.

Let's also talk about the last 1:30 of the game: **Dolphins deciding to go for it on 4th down and not  just kick a FG?** Getting 1st down would've ended the game...but wtf?

i saw the brand casabrews, and though it‚Äôs affordable, again i don‚Äôt don‚Äôt anything about espresso. i would also like to know what‚Äôs necessary to purchase with it? i see bundles with tampers and a portafilter. the grinder seems worth it. please throw as much as you know about it and your take on machines at me. thank you!

It‚Äôs just to help you get to know me before you message.

I‚Äôm Max and as the title states, I‚Äôm looking for a ride or die. Maybe that‚Äôs just through being friends, maybe that‚Äôs through something deeper? I‚Äôm open to that and everything between.
I‚Äôm posting as my social circle has shrunk quite a lot recently. I‚Äôve recently returned from a gap year working as a volunteer teacher in China and I‚Äôve lost contact with a lot of folk so I‚Äôm trying to build my connections up again.

I‚Äôm a pretty 50/50 split between being an introvert and an extrovert. I love getting cosy, curling up with a good cup of coffee, some movies or a book or even just staring out my window, headphones on, and watch the world go by. On the other hand, I yearn for the outdoors. If I‚Äôm not roaming the hills and forests with my camera, I‚Äôm almost certainly running or cycling miles along the roads, and I‚Äôve got some beautiful scenery to do it in. I run both for leisure and competitively and I‚Äôm just beginning a training block for an upcoming challenge next year.
I‚Äôm also into creative writing and poetry if there‚Äôs anyone else who‚Äôs interested in that!

If looks matter to you, I‚Äôm 6‚Äô0, pretty lanky but still fit, dark brown hair that‚Äôs in some kind of a messy fringe and blue eyes (that are apparently miley cyrus blue, whatever that means?)

I don‚Äôt ask for a lot in people, but honesty goes a long way. Otherwise just be yourself, however bubbly or serious that may be. If you think we‚Äôll click, don‚Äôt sit on the other side of the screen and wonder what could be - find out and tell me a bit about yourself!

I‚Äôm happy to chat through Reddit or move to another platform if and when you‚Äôre comfortable and I‚Äôve got no issue with sharing pictures. I‚Äôm also a pretty open book so if there‚Äôs anything that‚Äôs caught your eye here that you want to ask about, please do!

Hope everyone who reads this has a great day and I look forward to meeting people soon! :)",1,1761509678.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False
