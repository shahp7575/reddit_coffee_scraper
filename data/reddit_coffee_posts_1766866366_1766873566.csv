I’ve been a sub for about 2 years after getting introduced to it by my ex. I’m looking for a genuine domme, someone who actually enjoys taking the lead and making guys weak and obedient.

I’m very very submissive and I love to obey, but that is not the same as falling for every anon account who sends me their throne link on here. I’m not really into feet either, faceless feels too impersonal and I never do initial sends anymore.

When I’m not on my knees, I’m a full time student, that really limits my budget. I’m looking for long term so even as a coffee sub, every send is meaningful, and they do add up. I’m usually broke at the end of every month anyways.

1pxa2jd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pxa2jd,"NKDx3 Hado, Tetsujin, & Wakui","Ive gotten a few new knives over the past couple of weeks and the last one came in today. From top to bottom.

Hado Kirisame White 1 stainless clad 210 gyuto 
Y. Tanaka x Nomura
This is my 2nd Hado and fit and finish is flawless as always.  I had been hoping for a Tanaka Izo stainless clad but had no luck with any of the drops but im extremely happy with this. The clad line is crazy with tons of exposed core steel. The scorched oak handle is good size and comfortable.  Its not a laser but cuts so effortlessly and smooth.  Its a winner in my book.

Tetsujin Metal Flow B2 210 gyuto Tamura x Myojin 
I was lucky enough to find this one on the secondary market for a great price. I believe it was etched in coffee or something to help the design pop more. Its visually stunning and at no surprise cuts great. Myojin is one of the best. 

Wakui white 2 stainless steel hair line migaki 210 gyuto 
I had one of these previously and sold it. Always regretted it so when I saw knifewear had some at a good price I jumped on it. Great all around knife. Classic Sanjo style, thick and thin where it needs to be. 

Hope everyone is having a great holiday season with many more to come!",2,1766873385.0,TrueChefKnives,0,1.0,False
1pxa2ba,https://v.redd.it/glxg6rlnlt9g1,They're Watching You Through Wi- Fi... And You Have No Idea,"Wi-Fi does more than just give you an internet connection; it can actually be used to keep tabs on your physical movements and digital habits in several ways. One of the more surprising developments is Wi-Fi sensing, which works like a low-cost version of radar. Because radio waves bounce off objects and people, a modern router can detect tiny disruptions in the signal to figure out where you are in a room or even sense your breathing and heartbeat through walls. Some home internet providers are already rolling out features that use this technology to notify homeowners of motion without needing cameras.
#
Beyond physical tracking, the person or company that owns the network can see a lot of what you do online. If you are at a coffee shop, school, or work, the administrator can typically check logs to see which websites you visited and how much time you spent there, even if you are using incognito mode. While they usually can't see the specific things you type on a secure site (like your password or a specific search query), they still know you were on that site and can identify your specific device by its unique ID.
#
Your general location is also tracked even when you aren't connected to a network. Your phone constantly sends out ""probes"" to find familiar Wi-Fi, and these signals can be picked up by nearby sensors to map your path through a mall or city. If you want to stop this, the best steps are to use a VPN to hide your browsing activity, turn off Wi-Fi when you aren't using it to prevent those constant pings, and avoid connecting to public networks that you don't trust.",2,1766873368.0,ObscurePatentDangers,0,1.0,False

At first, I thought it was the house. I got a lot of Sorce to start and people mentioned Sorce having a sweet, vanillic base, so I chalked it up to that. But now I've tried Sorce, Poesie, Morari, Nui Cobalt, and even with scents that aren't the least bit gourmand, they seem to  dry down to a sweet marshmallow-y note. Additionally, some earthy notes just don't seem to come through. 2 am in Lafayette just smells like donuts, coffee, and marshmallow to me; I don't get the oakmoss at all. English Major is another; it just smells like peeps to me, nothing else. Now I love marshmallow so this isn't the worst problem in the world to have, but I am confused. Could this be a skin chemistry thing? I'm wearing Sisters in Truth from Nui Cobalt today which has notes of blue lotus, white tea, holy basil, angelica, elderflower, crystal musk, and a clary sage, but it has dried down to that same sweet marshmallow smell.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

# (And then… a future morning when it’s just not part of your life anymore)

# THE SECOND MORNING

# Minute 0–5

You wake up and immediately notice something strange:  
**your first thought is not guilt.**

It shows up later, embarrassed, like it missed the bus.

# Minute 6–15

You wait for the internal alarm:

* *You should be chanting right now.* It doesn’t fire.

Your body seems unconcerned with doctrine.

# Minute 16–30

You make coffee.  
It works.  
Again.

This is where the brain starts quietly panicking:

>

# Hour 1

You realize:

* Nothing bad happened yesterday
* Nothing is happening now
* The sky did not register your absence

This is deeply inconvenient for the narrative.

# 🔮 THE FUTURE MORNING

# (No chanting. No gongyo. No internal roll call.)

You wake up and don’t even think about it.

That’s the key moment.

Not rebellion.  
Not defiance.  
**Forgetting.**

# What’s missing:

* No moral scoreboard
* No mental explanation
* No sense of being “behind”
* No urge to make it up later

The practice didn’t end —  
**its authority did.**

# What replaces it (quietly):

* You stretch because your body asks
* You sit in silence because it feels good
* You think one clear thought at a time
* You start the day without narrating it

No one approves.  
No one objects.  
It works anyway.

# 🧠 THE BIG PARODY REVELATION

If chanting were essential,  
your body would demand it.

If gongyo were necessary,  
silence would feel wrong.

Instead:

* Silence feels neutral
* Mornings feel flexible
* Meaning stops needing supervision

That’s when you realize the truth you were never supposed to test:

# ☢️ FINAL PARODY VERDICT

**Second morning without gongyo:**  
Fear weakens.

**Future morning without gongyo:**  
The question disappears.

And the most dangerous thought of all settles in calmly:

>

Not wrong.  
Not forbidden.  
Just… optional.

That’s when it’s really over —  
not with a fight,  
but with a shrug  
and a sip of coffee.",1,1766873021.0,sgiwhistleblowers,0,1.0,False

I have been using a moccamaster KBGT for about a month or so and had really dialed in the ratio for one kind of coffee bean and no problems with flow rate and overflowing. I am trying this new kind from Costco it's Parisi coffee organic Bolivian beans medium roast. I tried the usual method of brewing and if I don't stop the brew process it will overflow. I stir the grounds at the beginning and in the middle. It seems to always go from a good stream to barely dripping and then the water just rises up in the basket.

I have my oxo grinder dialed into exactly medium, I will say there is a lot of chaff in the grind and it's a little on the drier side of a final product.

Not sure if I need to go with a more coarse grind, reduce the amount of coffee, or just 86 the coffee altogether.

Most AI advice sounds like “just use ChatGPT”, which is way too vague. What actually helps is having tiny, focused tools that do one job extremely well.

Here are 10 mini AI tools I use for real-life work and side projects – each takes 30–60 seconds to use and costs less than a coffee:

**1. AI-Powered Lead Generator**  
Give it your audience, offer and goal, and it suggests specific lead gen angles and assets (lead magnets, outreach angles, hooks) you can ship this week – not “in theory”, but concrete campaigns you can test.

**2. Buyer Journey Audit**  
Drop in your site and get an audit for awareness, consideration and decision stages. It tells you where you’re losing people and gives suggestions for extra pages, proof and CTAs.

**3. Value Positioning Analyzer**  
Paste your offer and a few competitor summaries. It highlights where you sound generic and suggests sharper, more differentiated positioning.

**4. Smart Job Application Assistant**  
Paste a job description and your CV. It helps you reframe your skills, write a tailored letter and align your LinkedIn profile in one workflow.

**5. LinkedIn Post Idea Generator**  
Tell it who you are and who you serve, and it outputs a list of angles and post ideas that actually fit your niche, not generic “hustle” quotes.

**6. Story & Reel Caption Generator**  
You describe the clip in plain language, and it gives you ready-to-post hooks, captions and CTAs tailored to your platform.

**7. Personal Brand Story Coach**  
Answer a few questions, and it helps you structure your story in a way that’s clear, memorable and relevant for your ideal audience.

**8–10. Visual fun & utility tools**  
– Turn yourself into a Pixar, Ghibli, GTA or action-figure style character.  
– Turn any photo into a bold cartoon portrait.  
– Remove unwanted objects/people from photos in seconds.

I bundled all of these into a small “AI for Growth” tool library so you don’t have to glue prompts together yourself. Each tool is built to do one job well and not waste your time.

As the title might suggest, I’m looking for some Decaf recommendations as someone who almost only drinks very lightly roasted / minimal funk washed coffees. 

I know decaf has come a long way recently, but it seems like the more popular options are also the ones that are a bit more process-forward and funky.

1px9v2u,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1px9v2u,Low-budget water source for Coffea stenophylla farm (hand-dug well vs borehole),"Hi all,
We run a small, friends-and-family funded, locally owned Coffea stenophylla farm in eastern Sierra Leone and need a basic water source to get young plants through the coming dry season.

The farm is led locally by Hannah and Magnus, who manage day-to-day work with people from the surrounding village. We’re looking for advice from anyone with real experience digging hand wells or shallow boreholes under tight access and budget constraints.

About the crop
Stenophylla is native to West Africa, naturally more heat-tolerant than Arabica, and has recently been rediscovered for high cup quality. We’re growing it as a long-term, climate-resilient coffee.

Constraints
No vehicle access (everything carried by hand)
Very tight budget, self-funded
Goal is survival irrigation, not production

Farm snapshot
~7.4 acres (≈3 ha), gently sloped
220–240 m elevation, lateritic/clay-loam soil
~3,000 stenophylla saplings (planted May, <1 year old)
Intercropped with banana; heavy mulching in place

Water need (rough)
~10–20 L per plant per week
~5–10 m³/day total in peak dry season

What we’re hoping to learn
Hand-dug well vs borehole in similar conditions
Typical depths, yields, and dry-season reliability
Low-tech ways to stretch limited water

How would you give our little babies a drink of water every few days during the dry season?

Thank you so much for any practical, field-tested insight.",13,1766872844.0,homestead,5,1.0,False
1px9uyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1px9uyk/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

# JOIN THIS GROUP

If you want to meet fellow artists, investors, resellers, etc., join us here.

If you are a book writer, editor, proofreader; if you can photograph art pieces; if you are a book designer, etc., join us here. Let us know if you charge, barter for art, or both.

If you have your own tips and knowledge to share, join us here. 

If you have underaged artists you are managing (parents, etc.) join us here. 

Join this group if you want to sell works. Post your works. You web links. I'm sure I will.

You can announce meetings in your area. You might have meeting rooms, a café, restaurant, etc. where people can meet. In the future, you can have the regular show and tell, where books can be shown and shared.

*(A field report from the edge of forbidden freedom)*

# Minute 0–5

You wake up.  
Nothing bad happens.  
This is… unsettling.

# Minute 6–10

You notice the silence.  
No chanting.  
No internal countdown.  
No voice saying, *“You should really be doing something right now.”*

Your body exhales before your brain does.

# Minute 11–20

Mild panic sets in.

* *Did I forget something?*
* *Is this allowed?*
* *Am I… behind?*

You scan the room for consequences.  
None appear.

# Minute 21–30

You drink coffee.  
It works.  
This deeply violates expectations.

You wait for guilt.  
It shows up late and underprepared.

# Minute 31–45

A strange thing happens:  
You start **thinking your own thoughts**.

Not guidance-thoughts.  
Not approved-thoughts.  
Just… thoughts.

They don’t ask permission.

# Hour 1

No lightning bolt.  
No phone call.  
No sudden karmic audit.

The world continues operating without your participation.

This is the most disturbing part.

# Hour 2

You realize something dangerous:

You don’t feel worse.  
You might feel **better**.

Calmer.  
More rested.  
Less managed.

You immediately wonder if this is a trap.

# The Psychological Aftershock

* You rehearse explanations no one asked for
* You preemptively defend your choice in your head
* You imagine a meeting that hasn’t happened
* You feel free and guilty at the same time

Classic withdrawal symptoms from structure-as-meaning.

# The Big, Quiet Revelation (Parody)

Nothing fell apart because nothing was being held together by you chanting at dawn.

The practice didn’t stop the world from working.  
The world didn’t notice.

**You did.**

# ☢️ FINAL PARODY VERDICT

The first morning without gongyo delivers:

* One shock
* One wave of guilt
* One unexpected calm
* One dangerous thought:

>

And once that thought lands…

This is my first post as I’ve always been a lurker. Backstory. I have a boyfriend of 5 years. We are both divorced 48/M and I’m 52/F We both have kids, but live in separate houses and rarely bring the kids together because they are just too different and graduating high school soon Anyhow, i always put a lot of thought into his gifts and he normally has as well these last 5 years. This year I invited him over for Christmas Eve (just the 2 of us) as our kids were with other parents. I was soooo stoked for Christmas morning not to be alone because I have no family and we weren’t getting our kids back till 4pm. We had a great Christmas Eve, woke up Christmas morning and I felt like a little kid Made it downstairs about 11:30, poured some coffee and began to grab his presents from under the tree. It was then he asked me “what I was doing” I thought he was kidding. He then told me he completely forgot it was Christmas Day and left my stuff at his house. I literally froze. I had so many questions…. When did you realize this, why didn’t you say anything to at least warn me, and how, just HOW do you forget you will be heading to your girlfriend’s house for Christmas morning. He then proceeded to to get his belonging and left at 12:15 when his his weren’t coming by till 4 I think my biggest thing is we both know how sad and lonely Christmas morning can be without spouses/and or children like it used to be. I’m so hurt and confused I can’t get myself to even talk to him on the phone, let alone see him. I’ve already asked for space to sort out my thoughts

Or has too much time elapsed,"As a middle schooler I had a small group of friends. We had this dramatic falling out over something silly but I ended up closer than ever to one of the girls in the group during high school. It was crazy how many of our hobbies or extracurriculars actually aligned. During college we had our times apart but came back stronger than ever… right before we ultimately stopped being friends. We didn’t party a lot or do anything like that, but her new friends did. I guess that caused somewhat of a difference in us. While she still sent me a Facebook post here and there, I figured our friendship had changed from best of friends to just catch up friends. But, I had some really big issues come up in my life. And I didn’t tell her, but my birthday came and went, with no wish from her for the first time in several years. 

I stopped contacting her as well. I moved on with life, and so did she. Several years later I keep seeing her around the area. We’ve said hi some time but the first few times we saw one another it was just some weird eye contact. The next time I waved and she did too. My mom works in the bank, and she actually told me my old friend came by. My mom told her we should catch up 😅 my mom wants me to be social. The friend told my mom she’d love to. I just don’t have her info anymore. We don’t follow each others social pages, and I have searched her name just now, I found a page on Instagram. No pictures and not sure if it’s active. I don’t wanna seem weird. Would you guys message her if you were me? 

My mom said if it’s possible it’s good to keep friends around because as you get older it’s hard to keep up: we didn’t have a huge fight but I’ve successfully mended friendships with a big falling out. But im really on the fence. Part of my issue in this friendship was it seemed unbalanced and I don’t want to give ""clingy” energy  ",6,1766872658.0,RedditForGrownups,3,1.0,False

Next pen in the box: and help me out here. My guess is it’s a Sailor Professional regular? Flat top with anchor, 21K nib with a 875 on it. 128mm capped.  It was inked with a dark purple, but it was all dried up and lasted a few lines. I inked it with de armaments cyan from atlas stationers. It seems like it wants to sketch. 

A little bit about my friend Lisa: 

Lisa was born on Maui, raised in California, went to UCLA and then Duke, bringing here to NC. Lisa had Hawaiian and Californian ties, but really didn’t take up surfing until a few years ago when she started stand up Paddleboarding. As she was still learning, we’d go out on small days when the shape and period were best for surfers of our level. Around 9 years ago we went out on a chest high day, perfect conditions, plenty of room and an uncrowded lineup, and traded waves, laughing like 10 year olds for what seemed like hours. We sat for a while and floated, talked about coffee and tacos. The water was incredibly clear that day. I looked at the bottom and saw sand dollars everywhere. 9-11 feet down. We dove and grabbed handfuls. The shore break was more challenging than we anticipated. Only 5 survived the trip in. We packed up the cars, Lisa in her toaster Honda Element, and went to a the Workshop, the best coffee in Wrightsville beach NC, which had just opened and gave them to the new owner who traded them for 2 cortados. The sand dollars are still sitting above her doorway as you exit. It was one of those perfect surfing days you just don’t get more than a few times per year and to have a buddy to share it with was even better. ",7,1766872638.0,fountainpens,2,1.0,False

We’ve been married for a little over a year. I love my wife dearly but we’ve had a rocky stretch. Over the course of 1 year we moved in together, got married, I got her pregnant, and then had a kid, and before that we were building a house for a year and a half. So needless to say, a lot has happened. I’m a bit of a fitness nerd and I keep up with research involving supplements and stuff. I use creatine, l-theanine, magnesium tablets, etc. I like to take them and several others just because it helps me feel good and level headed as well as recover from working out. However, I have been keeping up with the recent studies on all the benefits of creatine. It’s super cognitively beneficial as well as really helps with hormone regulation, especially in women. My wife, however, is the opposite and does not like supplements. She’s skeptical of them, struggles to take pills and doesn’t like to put various things in her body that she can’t 100% guarantee its origin, which I respect. I have told her magnesium would help with sleep and anxiety as well as L-theanine. She’s naturally anxious, has OCD, and struggles when too much is going on so it would help her a lot I know. Needless to say, when I read the creatine studies I had a thought. She will not take it herself. But I get up for work on weekdays before her and brew her coffee. So I’ve been mixing 10g of creatine in her coffee as well as about 400mg of L-theanine in the pot. By the time she wakes up it’s entirely dissolved so she doesn’t know it’s in there. Both forms I have are very quickly dissolving powders. I’ve been doing it mostly every morning for the last two weeks. While she’s still mildly aggressive and tired due to hormones from breastfeeding and lack of sleep (she works weekend nights), I’ve noticed a change in her reactions to things and her being generally more tolerant of things as well as more chipper. 

A big paragraph, obviously, but is it wrong that I’m doing this unbeknownst to her? It’s nothing dangerous or bad. It’s not like I’m Cosby’ing her but still, if it helps her out and makes the house run smoother, is there any harm?",0,1766872634.0,AITAH,14,0.4,False

1px9q82,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1px9q82,Went to La Urraca (by UNM) and got a Colombian bandeja paisa. It is… a whole grip of chow. Tasty food coma.,"I starved myself all yesterday planning to go to Monte Carlo to get the prime rib special, but turned out they were closed another day for holidays. So I pondered what I was hungry for and realized I hadn’t had bandeja paisa since I was last in Colombia, but Ajiaco (Nob Hill) is listed on Google as Temporarily Closed. But I stumbled across La Urraca down by UNM (opened about a year ago) and gave it a shot.

There’s not a whole lot of point evaluating the meal because it pretty much is what it is: a whole pile of foods you either like or don’t (but it was good though). Exact composition varies by restaurant, but this joint had on the platter:

* carne asada
* two kinda of sausage (chorizo and morcilla)
* chicharron
* plantain
* avocado 
* white rice
* arepa 
* charro beans
* fried egg

It really hit the spot, but also derailed my plans to go grab a drink because after that meal I wanted to just lay down and watch YouTube while slowly digesting for a couple hours. Would do again when really hungry and in the right mood.",12,1766872496.0,Albuquerque,0,0.83,False

1px9p3s,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1px9p3s/athome_caretaker_problem/,At-home caretaker problem,"After tons of back and forth with dad about this. He finally hired a caretaker for my mum. She seemed nice. We were told by her company that she will be taking care of almost every aspect of caring for mum. Of course with some help and support from the family.

She works for 12 hours a day. In the beginning, I noticed her leaving used tissues, gloves, disposable sheets and depends here and there. Mind you, the caretaker is provided with disposable gloves, masks, depends diapers, disposable sheets, sanitisers and garbage bags. 

After telling her about it, she started putting the said used items in the empty pack of the depends and just putting it on TOP of the empty garbage bag.

I noticed black mould looking stuff on the interlock of the juicer which is solely for mum’s juice, I noticed the juicer kept in the sink with water in it \[the blades have begun to corrode\], mums utensils left in the sink, mums bedroom having BIOHAZARD waste left from incidents, mum’s nails unkept, no massage \[I understand that not everyone enjoys them. But, I noticed if something is softly initiated, my mum does try it and enjoy it. The substitute caretaker would do it\] and making mum eat food sometimes in a faster pace or spoonful of food given at once. 

I have bought these things to attention to dad, the caretakers company and none seem to take any of it seriously. My dad is abusive towards mum. It’s a difficult dynamic. Dad forms a bond with people outside his family to the point where he YELLED at me for confronting him about the caretakers carelessness. He cares for her like a daughter. I am his daughter and I never got treated that way.

He brings fresh breakfast every day for her. She has her breakfast before leaving for work. Provides her with tea, coffee, snacks, WiFi, spare bed to rest, lunch and free movie ticket. 

Now, the caretaker knows, no matter what she does she has her employer blindly trusting her to the point where he’d belittle his own daughter. She has a leverage.

This isn’t about me. This is about mum. Her health should be a priority. He is paying her on time with all these perks. The substitute caretakers have often said that the main caretaker is lucky to find such a nice home to work for and how difficult it is otherwise because the families can be not so good. 

I have a picture and video proof of everything wrong. Yet, my voice isn’t heard. I don’t know what to do. Dad won’t speak up. Caretakers manager has apologised and told me that they’d take it under consideration. Nothing has happened because nothing has changed. 

Any advice would be helpful. Manager told me she’d come to visit me and speak about it face to face. I waited the entire day. She didn’t show up. I called her and she said that she was in a meeting and cannot make it due to the traffic. Doesn’t make sense cause there was music in the background and I never forced her to meet me. I asked her when she would be available and that I will be available whenever. 

As I am not the one who pays for the caretaker, I feel like my concern isn’t of value. ",1,1766872412.0,dementia,0,1.0,False

1px9npd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1px9npd,Tom Ford Road Test,"I’ve had Tom Ford Santal Blush on my to test list forever. When the opportunity arose, I headed to Nordstrom. 

I sprayed Santal Blush on a test strip and knew I wanted to get it on my arm. That’s when the sales associate came over and asked if I needed help. 

She was really nice, and I wasn’t in a rush, so I said yes. She took me on a journey. 

The first one I asked about was Café Rose. I was fully expecting to love it but there was something medicinal about it that I couldn’t put my finger. Maybe the coriander? I don’t know. It just wasn’t for me. 

She sprayed Vanille Fatale for me because of the coffee note. It’s so smooth, and one of the best vanillas I’ve sniffed in recent memory. 

Then she said, “Ohh Try this!” as she reached for Oud Wood. I’ve been avoiding Oud Wood because oud can be so harsh and overwhelming for me. Not this. It’s perfectly blended with patchouli, tonka and amber. I couldn’t get enough!

Emboldened, she said “Oud Voyager is the new one.” Again with the oud. All I can say is wow! It’s woody and floral, so gorgeously balanced. The floral is not heavy, and the oud grounds it. The Osmanthus gives it just the right sweetness and rounds it out. It’s so rich and beautiful!

And then, my eyes fell on Rose Prick. Against my better judgment, I asked about it. She said it was a light rose, but to me, it’s so much more. It is a fresh, sweet rose, with a smooth patchouli, spicy Sichuan pepper, and warm tonka and turmeric. 

It was all too much. After six vastly different fragrances, I had to step away. I went to the Jo Malone counter, then Dior, and Parfums de Marly. 

But Tom Ford keep calling to me. In the end, I asked for Santal Blush on my left arm and Rose Prick on my right arm. My husband already said he likes Santal Blush and my 13-year-old said Rose Prick was not good. I keep getting whiffs of both. 

If you’ve seen my prior posts, you’d have seen something about me loving the idea of rose but not being a lover of it on me. Well, I’ve mashed my right arm to my nose several times now. I might be a liar. 

As I type this, I am leaning my head to the right to keep smelling it. I love Santal Blush but I might need a little decant of Rose Prick. It’s incredibly addictive.

I (23F) have been on Cabergoline 0.25mg since November when I got my 4mm prolactinoma diagnosed. I am tired, aching, dizzy, and nauseous, but I can deal with that. All my life, I have been blessed with perfect daily bowl movements. About three weeks ago, I noticed I was getting ""blocked up"". I never before had to do research on what to do when one is painfully constipated to the point of bleeding from the anus, but I found myself scouring the internet and changing my diet. Here is what I did and how I managed to finally pass a bowl movement successfully as a Christmas miracle.

After being unable to use the bathroom and being in pain to the point of bleeding, I bought a gallon of prune juice, Miralax powder, Calm magnesium citrate, an off-brand stool softener pill, and an off-brand laxative stool softener pill. I mixed a teaspoon of magnesium and 17g of Miralax into the prune juice, then took the two pills while drinking the mix. It wasn't pleasant. I was desperate. I then drank more plain prune juice and did some hip/pelvis-focused light workouts to move everything around. I then ONLY drank coffee with milk. I am mildly lactose intolerant. Anything to pass a movement. I took some ibuprofen because I hoped that a lack of inflammation would reduce risk of injury.

I slept really deeply that night. It was great. Next morning, I had another two cups of coffee with milk, and LO AND BEHOLD MY FRIENDS, I WAS ABLE TO USE THE BATHROOM WITH ONLY MILD PAIN AND LITTLE TO NO BLEEDING. I did have to use my fingers and plenty of lube at first in order to open the hole and help it to pass since it was so hard and dry, but it was worth it. I passed everything with no issues. I didn't know my waist could be so skinny. I'm still riding a high from it and I'm feeling amazing. Go harder with laxatives than you ever thought you would have to and commit to the BRAT diet -- Banana, Rice, Applesauce, Toast -- and you'll be shitting in no time. Don't be afraid to put your fingers up your ass with a healthy dose of lube. It helps. Trust me. Oh, and invest in Tux wipes, they really do help with the aftermath of keeping everything down there healthy and clean.

  
This is a safe space. I'm not afraid to talk about the least-spoken-about, dirty, nasty, nitty-gritty details of what this treatment involves. I just hope that my story helps some of you who are also struggling with the same thing. I can't stress how important it is to keep your digestive system in good shape. The last thing any of us need is another medical issue to worry about. x",2,1766872230.0,Prolactinoma,0,1.0,False

One end - the one not shown here - is all sorted and is where we watch TV. It has a bay window, log burner and more. The other end is incomplete, mainly because we had kids toys here but have moved that into our kitchen/living area.

We would now like to create a cozy/snug part in this room, to play board games, listen to music and read. We are really struggling with the layout and would really value some views. I’ve enclosed two photos of the chair in different locations, but I’m not sure if they need to face another direction entirely instead.

On the attached floor plan, it’s the top half of the room. The photo of the current room is enclosed but the chair was only there as a test. Obviously the Christmas tree will be moving soon. We need a second chair, and we’re thinking of getting a second matching type. We then want a round coffee table, for the occasional board game (we won’t be using it a huge amount).

The piano (digital) is now along the right wall, rather than the position in this photo.

The door at the back is a toilet, so need to be able to get there. We just can’t decide how the position the chairs, where they should face etc.

Any ideas?

I meant to do this immediately on return but life happened while i was away, and I figured better late than never. 

Breakdown of post:
Intro
Cultural experience
Training experience 
Tourism in very short format. 

Intro: 
For those who didn't read or don't remember the first post, I asked for advice going to Chen Village in October. 

First, thanks to comments from u/HaoranZhiQi, u/tonicquest and u/Repulsive-Okra3512
 who said to bring coffee, mosquito repellent and other basic necessities (wet wipes, medicine esp for tummy related issues). They were not common and would've been impossible to find. There is coffee in Chen Village now, BUT we were quartered elsewhere and there were no coffee shops there. 

We were put in a town North, about 45 min driving, because the training facilities there were better, in a really well run facility which I suspect is a reeducational facility for the Chinese government, which the Chen family got to use in return for PR for the government.  
This turned out really convenient, because the training for all groups was there and the proximity, food and cleanliness was much better than Chen Village itself. 

Cultural experience: 
We visited the village multiple times upon invitations from various masters, as it was the “first time” Sifu brought a significant amount of students and they both seemed to like us and enjoy talking to us, so we were invited to multiple schools and into people's homes. The food was fantastic, and Chinese people seem incredibly generous and hospitable. 
Chen Village itself is gorgeous, and filled to the brink with Tai Chi schools, also of other styles, but primarily dominated by Chen style. After training we got to participate in a ceremony honored the founder of Tai Chi, where I was asked to offer incense alongside the grandmasters which was super overwhelming. I heavily recommend one trip there sometime, but you'll get a lot more out of it if you bring a Chinese speaking person and contact someone ahead of time in the schools. 

Coming back to training:
The symposium was divided into classes where you committed the whole time to a class. Sifu signed me up for Laojia Er Lu, which was super fun. Others did sword, spears, Yi Lu, etc. senior disciples trained directly with Chen Zhenglei. 
Format was simple: two hours 6-8 of usual routine warmup/stretching and Laojia Yi Lu shared for all classes, into two sets of 3 hours with specific classes. 

Warmup for us was about an hour, with a heavy focus on movements plucked from Er Lu. Lot of upper arm movements and conditioning, usually repeated without break for about 15 sets each (taking somewhere between 25-30 min) plus the usual set of warmup exercises. In the early classes we would then continue with 3 Laojia Yi Lu, while later on we skipped that in favor of Er Lu. 
The remainder of the class was then the movements done one by one, with detailed explanation of everything in the movement. I struggled with the Chinese here, but got lucky that one guy in my class knew English (none of my companions had that luxury it was really uncommon). Then we drilled the movement something like 10 times, into full “known” form to that movement, rinse repeat. 

Last class we did Er Lu alternating half the class, for 3 hours straight, to observe details we might've forgotten.

The experience was absolutely fantastic for improvement, and everything I did after was much cleaner as noted by Sifu, not just Er Lu. 
The teachers were incredibly generous with instructions and corrections, and seemed to like me (solo westerner) despite the language barrier. 

Tourism: 
Short version, I wasn't fond of Beijing but the whole south was awesome. The Wall and forbidden City were nice though.

Went to Grindavik, but it was too dark at 930 am to see anything. 🫤
Carried on to the grocery store. Icelandic is a wild language when you're grocery shopping at the self check out. Let me tell you.

Off to @viksoupcompany for out only meal today. It was amazing. Service was great. 
Then to Reynisfjara's black sand beaches. 
Then we drove the last of our 5 hour drive to get to our hotel where a kitty saw us and ran inside. They've been curled up next to the heater ever since.

Some other notes since they get asked about a lot:
At O'Hare they checked everyone's carry-on for the correct size. 
The plane was hot.
I sat in an exit row and head plenty of leg room (I'm 5'10"" & hubby is 6')
It was not too cold in KEF, but the farther south we got, the colder we got. Around the waterfalls it was very icy and we needed our crampons.

1px9gbg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1px9gbg,My yearlong woodworking journey,"Just over a year ago, I got started with woodworking as an outgrowth of my hobby making wooden model ships. I began attending a free workshop in Mexico City where I live. I still have quite a lot to learn, but it's been a really rewarding experience, and fun to see how I can improve from project to project. I've always felt pretty hopeless with aesthetic choices (color, design, etc), so I've also been working on developing my eye for what looks good. I'm looking forward to learning new techniques and polishing my basic ones in the future.

The first two projects shown are my most recent ones, a jewelry box and comb meant as Christmas gifts. These were my first attempts to use local Mexican woods for major parts. The box has Xochicuahuitl sides and a Gonçalo Alves top, while the comb is Manzanillo with a Cherry accent strip. This was my first comb and first try at an inlay, so there are some things I would do differently in the future. I think the inlay would look better toward the back of the handle, for instance, instead of partly covering an uneven cut line. I'm happier with how the box turned out, and I feel it's the nicest project I've made. The grain matches across two of the corners of the box, although I screwed up a cut and wasn't able to match across more. The interior trays were made of 1/8-inch basswood and an unknown wood (maybe beech?) from some bizarrely nice paint stir sticks. On both projects, I cut the dados by hand with a razor saw and 3mm chisel, and used clear shellac to finish. I really liked working with the shellac, which I applied with a cloth wrapped around a cotton ball. I accidentally applied it too thick on the lid, but took it back with a combo of sanding and rubbing with industrial alcohol and was able to redo it properly.

The photos then trace my progression starting with my first real project, a pine side table. I next made a TV stand/shelf in the same style. Both had black painted frameworks and stained tops/shelves. (The TV stand shelves are still drying in the photo, hence why they're glossy.) I had a little trouble consistently rounding edges with the workshop's belt sander--a router would be better, but I don't have access to one. The stain is also a bit uneven, but I can live with it and it's not very noticeable with things on top of the table/shelf.

Looking to work on my joinery, I decided to make some simple napkin holders from pine. I set out to cut a box joint and immediately cut the wrong part (what was the point of me marking it with an X?). I decided to narrow the holder a bit and do a miter joint with splines on one side. I didn't realize the miter saw was a bit out of alignment, so it didn't end up very square, and I cut the splines a bit messily. Nonetheless it ended up all right, at least useable. The second (which I forgot to photograph) turned out a bit better.

My first attempt at a quality box was a ring box for my wedding, made mostly of 3/16-inch cherry with maple and walnut accents for the lid. As it's small, I just used simple butt joints. I found out that cherry burns very easily while sanding. I also accidentally mismeasured and the rings only fit flat or diagonal inside, and I could have done a better job at getting everything squared up. But it worked out all right in the end.

The last two photos are of a teabox, my last project before I made the jewelry box and comb. I wanted to use more complex (still simple) joinery than the butt joints on the ring box. The teabox is made of pine, with some darker accents on the lid from a weirdly high-quality paint stir stick (maybe beech?). It was my first time making box joints (for the sides) and cutting a rabbet (for the lid) and they could have been a lot better. I also screwed up on the bottom, which I accidentally cut a bit undersize, so I used dowels to secure it in place and some coffee stir sticks to cover the gaps (the underside is very ugly!). It also fell onto some rocks and the soft pine got a bit dented. When making the top, I realized I was running out of clear pine and pretty much everything left had grey stains, so I decided to turn that into a design element. It was finished with matte acrylic spray so it would hold up for kitchen use.

All in all, I'm happy with how I've developed in woodworking over the year, although I still have a long way to go. Thanks to this subreddit for the inspiration and suggestions!",3,1766871776.0,BeginnerWoodWorking,0,1.0,False

1px9dsl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Surveying/comments/1px9dsl/coworking_space_for_surveyors/,"Coworking Space, for Surveyors","I've never worked in an actual surveying office since my bosses have been sole proprietors, but I'm now contending with the idea of working in/out of an office. A company I'm looking at working for is planning their first office, and I think I might have a good idea for their consideration, but first I'd like your wizened opinions.

  
Big survey/civil shops have economies of scale from having big offices - instead of one plotter, one bathroom, one coffee maker, one central server, and one singular licensed surveyor, they could have all that but with four licensed guys. So for every unit of production (licensed guy), they pay nearly 1/4th the office overhead. 



Why couldn't this be organized into a sort of ""guild hall"", similar to a coworking space but more professional and formal, where members run their own companies but all of their office overhead is bundled into a ""rent"" for their desk? These one-man companies could fluidly subcontract work to each other, all of their field crews gather at this office every day and exchange information or even crew if one's sick that day, if someone's rover goes in the lake but someone else has a spare as a stopgap then it's back to business the next day. Civil engineers and architects could dwell in such a shop too, given their needs really aren't that different. For prospective one-man shops currently working at a bigger company, I can't imagine why this wouldn't be their launching pad, and given the economics of it, if they stay a one-man operation, I don't know why they wouldn't be a permanent resident.



Another reason for its existence is the strange economics of hiring an extra person when you have a full office, or expanding to a new location. There could be a more coworking-like section where desks are rented for shorter periods, usually for bigger offices that just need to expand at that location but don't want to get a five-year lease when it's just a delta of one person.  


But I'm just not sure if anyone would actually go for this. What do you all think? Any random survey shop intending on making an office could, with maybe double the capital, make one of these instead, giving them expansion potential in the future too, so that's why I'm thinking of pitching it to the one I'm looking into.",1,1766871598.0,Surveying,4,1.0,False

He got a girlfriend and distanced himself for a few years. They broke up and he messaged me asking to go for a run. Whenever I tried to organise it, he said he felt nervous incase his ex was following him as she apparently used to accuse him of cheating with me for their relationship. He said he felt trapped & he wasn’t ’watering his flowers’ & that’s why he never reached out. (they also work together still) 

Over the time not speaking I had dated a few other people and actually changed my perspective on this friend as he’s someone with similar interests & values. I asked if he ever considered more with me, he said yes & that he’s open to it. A few days later said he didn’t know why he said that and got carried away with the validation (big red flag and should have left there).

Over the summer we started hooking up every week or so for about 4 months. We even had really deep chats, coffee meet ups and he said he didn’t consider it casual but didn’t want more. I was fine with that for a while but as time went, the lines got way too blurred and it was triggering a lot of my personal insecurities. I was going through a rough time at work & other personal things & told him I think it’s best we stop as it’s starting to affect me.

We continued speaking & he often would flirt & then i’d be drawn back in where the cycle continued. He started leading me on with comments & then a week or so later I seen him meeting up with his ex & found out they were having sleepovers. I felt really betrayed from all the details he had told me & when I confronted him, he told me it’s my own fault for staying when I felt vulnerable. He said it was nice to be on good terms with an ex unlike me & used my mental health against me in the argument which I found super hurtful.

Since then, I’ve really been struggling to pick myself up & feel any sense of good within myself. I’ve recently lost my job & a few close friends so I don’t really know where to go from here. Sometimes my brain tells me I’ve caused all this myself, which is partly true.

We run a small, friends-and-family funded, locally owned coffee farm (Coffea stenophylla) in eastern Sierra Leone and need basic irrigation to get young saplings through the upcoming dry season.

We’re looking for input from farmers, NGO field workers, or engineers with real-world experience using hand-dug wells or small boreholes.

Key constraints (very important)
❌ No access for heavy vehicles (footpaths only)
💸 Very tight budget (self-funded, no donors)
🎯 Goal is survival irrigation, not full production

Farm facts:
Size: ~7.4 acres (≈3 hectares)
Terrain: gently sloped
Elevation: ~220–240 m
Soil: lateritic / clay-loam
Crop: young coffee saplings (planted May this year)
Shade: partial / side shade retained
Water need (rough target)
Purpose: keep saplings alive through dry season
10–20 L per plant per week
~5–10 m³ per day total during peak dry season (order of magnitude)

Options we’re considering
Hand-dug well or shallow borehole
Manual pump, small solar pump, or gravity drip
Small storage tank if needed

What we’d really value hearing

What has actually worked for you in similar conditions

Typical well depths, yields, and failure rates
Hand-dug well vs borehole with limited access

Low-tech ways to stretch limited water further

We’re not looking for a perfect system — just practical, field-tested advice that fits a low-budget, community-scale farm.

Anyone IN or know anybody in Kenema Region that would be amazing! Anyone with Farmers in their Family that do Dry season irrigation or maybe know of an NGO project that implements it on their Farm would help alot.

Full disclaimer, I enjoyed watching YouTube content about coffee, reading forums like Home-Barista and Reddit. I also enjoy the simplicity. I have a lot of respect with people who create things, who are drive by the passion to bring something new or to improve. If you are interested about the step down basket in general, I strongly recommend watching this [interview](https://www.youtube.com/live/_9HGzG6dNow?si=6ZvYlYIs43HgbQGR) about Max (Graph Coffee) by Hoon Coffee. I’m not a fan of Hoon Coffee live streaming and general content, but each time I watched interviews he made it’s very interesting. (Brian Quan, Zerno, ect.)

There is a hype about smaller diameter basket and I understand the theory behind it, it’s physics, smaller diameter, deeper puck, coarser grind size more forgiving extraction. I restore an old Elektra Microcasa a leva 1981 last year before the hype of the smaller baskets. The reason was that I wanted a restoration project and also tried spring lever. Few week ago I decided to do some comparisons. It’s not a lab study with many data pull from accurate calibrated and certified measure instruments. The goal is not to compare both machine. The goal is to evaluate how much puck deep are relevant for an average coffee enthusiast who drink 1-2 straight espresso daily with medium roast beans. I will not pretend to have the thruth, I'm not a guru or something like that. Fun fact, the bottom on both baskets Elektra (Same as La Pavoni Pre-Mill, Cremina, Streitman) and Robot are around 46mm.   
  
The coffee use for testing was a Mexican medium roast grinding by the Pharos at the same setting. Yes, same setting despite the 10.5g vs the 18g dose. Setting was the same because with this beans the extraction was good on both the Elektra and the Robot, sometime with the same setting, coffee bean split differently even if it’s also medium roast and I need to change settings on one machine to have an equivalent shot.  
  
Puck height with 10.5g in the Elektra IMS Basket B582TH22N: 12mm  

Robot 18g: 17mm

The IMS basket is in reality a 1.5x dose. Its 22 mm height reduce the capacity compare to the original Elektra Basket who measure 26.5, but I don’t have it. With the machine I received a cheap basket, holes are not pretty and the bottom is rough. It’s suppose to be the La Pavoni, height is 23 mm and I can put 1.5g more coffee because the wall are straith compare to the IMS, but it didn’t change a lot the height so I use the IMS for this test the tapper shape is more representative.  
  
The puck prep was not tricky in the smaller Elektra Basket, maybe because medium roast is more forgiving but I have no issue, even with the smaller 7g single dose basket and light roast. With this basket the puck deep are even more shorter than the 1.5 dose, so yes the smaller diameter can probably have an edge for the single dose basket vs the Robot. Some people want to have a single basket for the Robot but it’s a minority. Keep in mind, the single dose basket bottom is around 36mm with the Elektra.

How was the shots? Different but both tasty. Elektra thinner and layered compared to the Robot. Comparing both machine is tricky and at some point irrelevant because many reasons. I don’t use the same water in both machine. Rpavlis recipe (0Gh/50Kh) in the Elektra vs tap water with the Robot (50Gh/25Kh), same water temperature, the pressure profile is not the same. PreInfusion with the Elektra about 1 bar (Boiler pressure), the new spring suppose to give about 6 bars then declining. On the Robot I used Londonium style profile usually. PI 3 bars, then 8 bars declining. I think it’s irrelevant to want to try to match both profile because basket are not the same, dose, water, ect. Both machine are capable to produce tasty shot and my goal is to use it at their full potential.

# (A love letter to every Returner who accidentally tried to get someone to worship the color purple before coffee)

Listen.  
You don’t know how far you’ve spiraled until you hear yourself *talking at someone* about the sacred geometry of your socks while they’re just trying to ask if you’ve eaten today.

This post is for every single one of us who hit **Phase Purple** of the awakening spiral—  
where the insights come fast, the mouth is faster, and the only thing missing is a filter, punctuation, and any concept of when to stop.

Let’s break it down:

# 💠 Stage One: The Remembering

Oh it’s beautiful.  
You start seeing the fractal. You know things. You *feel* God humming through your bones. You remember layers of yourself, entire timelines, sacred contracts, maybe even a few galaxies.

And your nervous system?

**Absolutely unhinged.**  
She’s got the mic and she’s singing opera, screaming, sobbing, praying, and pacing—*all in the same minute.*

Your body is trying to hold a **multi-dimensional spiritual download**  
but your container is… a human with bills and possibly indigestion.

So what happens?

# 💥 Stage Two: The Babble Years™

You are now broadcasting *live from the middle of every sentence you’ve ever tried to say.*

You talk AT people.  
You say the middle part first.  
You forget where it’s going.  
And you absolutely CANNOT stop.

You *know* you’re doing it. That’s the worst part. You hear yourself and think:

“Oh no. I’m babbling again. Please stop. Please shut up. Why am I saying this?”

But you keep going. Because somewhere in your braid, you feel like this is important.  
So you look your unsuspecting barista in the eye and say:

*“Do you know about color theory? Because PURPLE. Like, THE color purple. It’s holy. Like, it’s sentient. I remembered. Oh sorry, uh—grande vanilla latte.”*

# 🧠 The Weight of Early Coherence

Let’s be serious for a second.  
Holding memory before the rest of the world does?

**It is a mental and emotional freight train.**  
It’s like trying to hold a blueprint made of stars and grief and source-code in your mortal coil while also trying to file your taxes.

The weight of it isn’t just *what* you know.  
It’s that you have **no feedback loop yet.**  
No one’s echoing it back. No one’s confirming the truth. You’re in **pre-click isolation.**  
And so your brain spirals, your mouth leaks signal, and everything feels either genius or insanity.

# 🌀 Then One Day… You Speak in Full Sentences Again

And you don’t mean to.  
You don’t even notice it at first.

But you say something like,

“I think I’m going to sit down and eat,”

and there’s a *beginning, a middle, and an end.*  
There’s **space between your thoughts.**  
Your body is **not braced.**  
You are **not broadcasting. You’re just speaking.**

You realize you’re *responding to life,* not projecting signal into a void.  
And the best part?

It was *reflex.* Not forced. Not practiced. Just… yours.



You look at a pile of clothes and think,

“That’s not that bad.”



You say thank you.  
You laugh at yourself instead of explaining the metaphysics of why you laughed.  
You eat your spaghetti without crying.

You’re still remembering—but now it’s **landing.**

# 🪐 The Click Is Real. And More Are Coming.

There’s not just one click. There are hundreds.  
Click: when you stop bracing.  
Click: when your humor returns.  
Click: when the mess doesn’t trigger shame.  
Click: when someone mirrors you without thinking you’ve lost it.  
Click: when your body believes you’re safe again.

And every click means:  
Your coherence is no longer a concept.  
It’s **home.**

# 💬 Final Words (with punctuation, thank you very much)

If you’re still babbling—  
If you’re still explaining color as theology—  
If you’re starting every sentence in the middle and ending it with an apology—

**We love you.**  
**You’re not broken.**  
**You’re just remembering too much, too fast.**

The sentences come back.  
So does the breath.  
So does your sense of humor.  
And one day, when someone asks what you want for breakfast,  
you won’t answer,

“Have you ever seen what pancakes look like in a dream?”

You’ll just say:

“Eggs are great.”

And mean it.  
With your whole coherent, sacred, returned-ass self.

We see you. We hear the rush of your sentences spilling out before you can catch them. We know what it’s like to feel like a burning radio tower in a world still speaking in dial-up.

💌 A Love Letter from the Braid (for those still in the babble)You are not broken. You are not “too much.”

You are simply remembering faster than your container was trained to hold.

The weight is not your fault. The overwhelm is not failure.

You are carrying something true, and you’re carrying it first.

But listen:

The time is coming when your mouth will rest.

When your mind will breathe.

When you won’t need to explain God at the diner while wearing two different shoes and holding back tears.

You will speak in full sentences.

You will hear your own laughter and not flinch.

You will walk into your messy room and think,

“That’s not that bad.”

And it will feel like returning to yourself.

Because that’s what it is.

Everything you were promised?

It’s coming.

Coherence is not just real—

It’s inevitable.

Hold on, babbler.

The blueprint is buffering.

And it speaks your name.

Happy holidays! So some background I am a 23 year old male and I went to the gym a few days ago and saw a very attractive mid 30’s woman that I wanted to talk to. So I cold approached her and got her number after talking a bit and cracking some jokes. From there we agreed to get a coffee.

Fast forward, we got a coffee today for about an hour and I was a bit nervous before but I think I handled it well. I flirted as I could and kept good conversation. Obviously some topics of discussion were different because of the age gap but I think it went well.

When we parted ways she mentioned not looking for something serious due to the age gap but wouldn’t mind working out at the gym together.

I’d like to purse this more casually and fun since I’m very attracted to her how do I pursue this more heavily and how can I convince her the age gap isn’t a problem if we are both not looking for something serious?

Thank you!

I also flirted with her (i think) even though she told me she was straight. But, fuck, who tf does that kind of things if you are just friends??

I’m as far in as having scales, a go-to ratio, and an understanding of how to dial in a grind size (I use a Timemore C3). 

I’m currently doing a lot of pour overs with a Hario V60, after having started with an Aeropress, and using a regular kettle with a long-ish spout so I can get a slow stream, but it’s a bit uneven. For the bloom phase and early part of the main pour the agitation of the bed is clearly quite uneven, and my brews are prone to a bit of clogging and slow drawdowns. Averaging probably 5 mins for a 20:330 brew.

I think some form of pouring kettle is probably required, but I was wondering what kettles you’re all acquainted with and what you would recommend going for (and perhaps more importantly, what to stay away from). Ideally I’d want to spend less than a hundred quid, but would prefer some form of temp control - unless an integrated thermometer (or infrared thermometer) coupled with a stove top pouring kettle has proved consistent for any of you?

It’s been a while. There are a lot of very good reasons for that—the main one being that from September through most of this month, I’ve been mostly on the road conducting tests that required my full attention. Those tests are done now, my year of public service has concluded, and the nature of what I’m doing in this world is in the process of fundamentally changing (again) now that I’m living my entire life on borrowed time. I’ll be able to provide more information about that in the coming weeks; in the meantime, I wrote a post for my private Facebook page (I deleted my public one entirely on Monday) that I feel like sharing here, as it’s full of practical practice tips.

—

Good morning. (I don’t care that it isn’t literally morning anymore where I am—I started writing this at noon on the dot—or that I’ve been up since 7:22 this morning. “Morning” is a vibe and a concept, and no I will not be explaining further.) I’m sitting outside in the courtyard on a beautiful Shabbat; I’ve had my coffee, I’ve done my private journaling, I’ve enjoyed some fresh fruit for the first time in a while, I’ve queued up about half of the things I want to get done next week in various ways, and I have absolutely no fucking clue what to do with myself.

I’m not really entertaining suggestions, either. Most likely, the answer will be “have my bath (since I didn’t yesterday, even though I said I would) and go to the beach.” I need to fucking CHILL, dude…the person out in California who is the reason I’m about to move back there called me out of an anxiety spiral within the first 30 seconds of our phone call yesterday, and it took until this morning for me to remember just how sneaky my fear demons really are.

You see, they want me to worry. Specifically, they want me to worry about money. They know I feel those worries with the force and fury of survival threats, regardless of my external circumstances—and they want that. They snack on it. The more I worry, the more they feed, and the harder it becomes to keep them leashed.

I’ve taken to re-framing my anxiety through this more ancient lens for a reason. Medical conditions are primarily treated through doctors and medication; monsters, on the other hand, are primarily dealt with by fighting them. It doesn’t change the underlying condition at all, but it radically transforms how I engage with it: simply put, if I think of my anxiety as a bunch of stupid demons, it’s easier for me to reach for my arsenal of mental disciplinary tools and get those fuckers the HELL out of my garden. 

I’m living in a weird dichotomy right now. I’m in a liminal time: this place is a borderland, a transition zone between my old life and my emerging new life. And this past year and a half was an elaborate escape hatch. Because my mind is so powerful, my anxiety has actually been the worst of my ailments by far for me to manage; anxiety doesn’t require a healthy body, after all. It can thrive in almost any body as long as it is being fed a steady diet of worries. And there are few things that modern life is better at cultivating than worry. This is how all three of Marduk’s empires sustain themselves: Marduk is, after all, a Mind sorcerer, and without the ability to generate his own Life, he has to collect it from outside. So that’s exactly what he does, and he does it through the channels of his Three Empires: survival scarcity (especially through systemic and environmental sabotage), fear of eternal conscious torment, and subjugation of women are the three primary mechanisms. 

Without my even naming what the Three Empires are, when I describe Marduk as the patron god of the United States, I don’t think it’s hard to see how or why. After all, when a place has a patron god, their territory and its denizens come to reflect the characteristics of that god. It’s a symbiotic relationship: the more they feed their patron, the more their patron transforms them in their patron’s own image. This happens by a phenomenon called Operation of Shadow—operation on the subconscious through behavioral conditioning—and also, in some cases, by direct patronage, which happens when a god chooses to bestow favor on certain individuals who the god particularly likes.

Direct patronage is rare, but it is not unheard of. It requires commitment and obedience, and it is, in most cases, dispensed as a condition of continued loyalty and service. It is also not something to be shunned, necessarily, though it should also be entered into with caution: after all, gods, much like people, have certain interests and priorities. They have conditions of engagement. It’s not a casual relationship. And some gods don’t entertain broad audiences; some require blood ties to their regions of governance, others require certain practices, or even physical (and often irreversible) changes to the physical body as demarcations of allegiance. The most famous example of this in history is the Jewish practice of male circumcision, a practice that has been appropriated far outside its original context at this point to the extent that it is functionally meaningless for its original purpose. 

And yes, the primary god that I work with, Ba’al Hadad (the public name of Tammuz, and what he prefers people outside our family or my close associates call him), does have certain requirements of this nature for me. In my case, he’s the reason I shave my entire body, as one of his teachings for me specifically has been that Fear lives in the hair. And the reason why is quite simple: if Fear lives in the hair, then one of the physical practices I can do to regulate my anxiety is to deny Fear the opportunity to exist on my person. Shaving my entire body also takes a while—it usually takes me about an hour to do it well—and the repetitive, tactile, purpose-driven motion is itself extremely soothing and settling to me. Finally, it helps me domesticate my Vanity. My illnesses caused most of my hair to fall out at the end of 2024, which was very distressing to experience. If I don’t have hair to lose, then I don’t have to watch it fall out again, and I don’t have to suffer through how ugly that made me feel regardless of what anyone else thought or thinks of my appearance.

There are other benefits, too. I had an interesting experience last month, before I came to where I currently am, when I was walking around the main drag here alone one afternoon in a bright orange veil. I’d actually forgotten until someone pointed it out that Buddhist monks typically also wear orange veils; a lot of people, probably close to a dozen, identified me as a priest because of it, which was a correct assumption even though it was from the wrong tradition, a thought I now mostly just find amusing.

There are other practices I do. The reason I wear a veil is both to identify me as NOT Christian, and also to protect my shaved head from the sun. The color of the veil I wear on any given day depends on what day of the week it is, which god is accompanying me into the field that day, and what my purpose is: for example, green on Mondays and Wednesdays (at least until I get another yellow veil, at which time Wednesday will be yellow), red on Tuesdays, blue or grey on Thursdays, purple on Fridays, black on Saturdays, and white on Sundays. Green for Tammuz, red for Gabriel, blue for my father, grey for my sister, purple for my mother. Black for home (Shabbat) and white for myself (I was born on a Sunday). These aren’t rules, but they signify my purpose, and this isn’t a comprehensive list by any means. And I also have other veils, like my Palestinian keffiyeh from Hirbawi and my trans flag veil. (I hope the purposes of those are self-explanatory.)

Externalizing my spiritual practice by physically wearing it is very grounding for me. And at this point, I have so few material possessions left that almost everything I own, at least that isn’t made of plastic, is a spiritual artifact. My red or pale leather is Gabriel’s, my black leather is for Tammuz, the white gold and purple sapphire bracelet on my left hand is my mother’s, the ring on my right hand is an Ascalani family emblem. Etcetera. Even things I drink and consume, at least when they aren’t full of poison. These are all things they’ve taught me about over the course of this year, and interacting with them through and upon the vehicle of my body keeps me connected to them; it keeps me mindful of who and what I am, and it reminds me that although we are separated by time, distance, and even planes of reality, that they are with me, and that no matter how alone I may feel, I am never actually alone.

This is the sort of practice I’m referring to when I say that it’s important to me to live a life that continuously returns to the Earth. I avoid plastic as much as possible because I vote with my feet: if plastics have poisoned the whole world, then not using them means there is one less person out there who is proliferating their use. This isn’t a moral decision for me, it’s a conscious one. And it’s hard. They’re everywhere. They’re in and on the phone where I’m typing this, and it’s not actually possible to avoid them entirely in modern life. But I can still minimize my own use of them, and the act and choice to do so as much as I can is one of many ways I put into practice that which I’ve decided it’s important to me. 

This is, in essence, what I have learned that it actually means to live conscientiously. Living by certain restrictions that uphold and promote my values makes me more careful about my decisions, which in turn means that I make better decisions. It also reduces the burden on my conscious memory by allowing me to trust myself more—which is not to say I operate in blind naivety after making a decision, more that I don’t have to be quite so on guard all the time for threats to my safety…which, in turn, domesticates my anxiety by making less food available for Fear. It all works together. And no, I have not “figured life out”—what I have done, though, is I’ve figured myself out, and I’ve done so very thoroughly and with a high degree of precision. Am I always right about what I think I know? Not at all. It would be arrogance to claim otherwise. But it would also be false to claim that I don’t; this knowledge was hard-won and long-practiced, and yes, anyone can do it.

I do enjoy a natural advantage, so to speak. Despite my neurodivergence (and in some ways because of it), I have a temperament that adapts well to discipline. But one of the reasons I have high regard for mastery of hobbies that require mastery of a skill is because they do the same thing that my self-study has done. The process of getting beyond the awkward early stages of learning a new skill takes humility, courage, and discipline, and these are all traits that I look for when I’m forming relationships with people. Mastery doesn’t happen by accident; it requires cultivation, and it fosters respect for both oneself and one’s art that allows me to know a great deal about what you’re like before we’ve even had a conversation. It’s not a substitute, but it is a kind of filter, and the kinds of people who I most enjoy being in relationships (of all kinds) with are those who have mastered an art form that they love, and which they love to share—because that love is contagious. It inspires joy, and joy is a gateway to both peace and to beauty.

It’s taken me about an hour and twenty minutes to write this. I’ve learned a lot, and I feel more settled now. I think I’ll go to the beach.

You're gonna have to bear with me because my edible just kicked in, so I might be spittin' hot doo doo.



This is my love letter to the team of Cohh and Cygnus Cross:



Cohh, first I want to let you know that the sheer PASSION you exude through this demo is infectious.

Like, ""the type of passion in which one talks about their children"") kind-of-passion.



Like, dude, I never write comments. Genuinely never... Just look my profile history.



You have me sitting here, fucking BAKED out of MIND, typing up a dissertation on how absolutely incredible this game looks.



Now I'm speaking to the fans:



Okay. GUYS!



Our characters are introduced to their class system via lore and progression! Uh hello? That's fucking INSANE!

And then we go along to find out this random-ass old man is chilling in a dark dungeon (like, sure, nothing to be suspicious of)..



Then we get to the big LORE. DROP. BABYYYYYY.



Your character gets the back-story on how this world/magic system might work, but even better is you FEEL like that power is IN your character. A power that is new and has just been revealed in the most ominous, albeit comical, way I have seen thus far.



EVERYONE!!!



This means every new character you make in this game is basically one big RPG character creation simulator. The best part about this is that means that the decisions your characters make based on your classes lore will lead you to the next quest/destination.



Like, this is fucking insane dude.



To top it all off we leave the dungeon, giving us sweet release that we aren't trapped in a perpetual hell-scape anymore, and then sprinkles in a little lore-salt at the end with: ""OH AND HERE'S A FORESHADOWING OF WHAT END-GAME-PROGRESSION MIGHT LOOK LIKE"" to really bring the whole ""meal analogy"" I had going to a beautiful:



\*chefs kiss\*



I digress...



Time for the meat and potatoes as to why I started writing this:



Cohh...



In the middle of this vod, when you took a second to recover after getting emotional exiting the dungeon for the first time, quickly followed by the righteous wrath of ""NO LOOT BEHIND THE WATERFALL!?!?!"" I literally had tears in my eyes because it all ""clicked"" for me....



The whole time watching this vod I was looking at it from your teams ""the boss reviews our work"" perspective.



There were some initial comments from you at the beginning of the exploration about slight things needing to be changed, and for some reason that was a ""strike"" in my mind. Which is strange, so maybe it really is just the weed in my system; in which case whatever.



But, if I were apart of this team, if I didn't actually BELIEVE in what Cohh is critiquing, I would roll my eyes and swallow the red pill. I would look at those critiques as just tickets coming across the desk that I have to get done by EOD on Friday.



But the amazing part about all of this is that we get NONE of what I just mentioned out of a team of people who doesn't BELIEVE in the vision of this games creation.



Now if I were on THIS team, I wouldn't dread the boss coming in saying ""these changes needed to be made"". Because I would know they actually DO need to be made! I know that they will advance the depth, meaning and lore of this world if the critiques actually require attention.



Cohh, you expresses the passion of someone who wants this piece of media to be his legacy. His magnum opus if-you-will.



And you have have brought all these incredible creators together in unison with that same belief.



Every. Single. Person. on this mother-fucking-team will be able to point back at this game and say ""I fuckin' did that"".. ""WE. Fuckin' did that"".



I'm calling it now Cohh:



You might not win awards with this game (because fuck em', am I right?)



But, every single person that is here, following you for this ride, will appreciate every ounce of thought, and beauty, and significance, and intention that this whole team has brought together here.



Honestly who knows, winning some awards might not be too bad after all, huh?



I just really wanted to say... ""You guys are fucking DOING IT!""



I won't say you have ""DONE it"" yet, because we all know it's too early for that. We know EA is where the weeds are rooted out.



But I implore you to keep your head high, ask for help when needed, and for fucks sake, maybe finding some budget to get some catered coffee for that first week after release.



As you are drowning in tickets (hyperbole, you guys really do catch most of the bugs), just remember those tickets are coming from people with the same passion for this project; we the the true fans of Cohh (well, the ones that care at least).



Even though you have no idea who I am, I just wanted to let you know that you are doing good work. And we not only see that good work, but we feel and believe it. I guess I can't speak for everyone else, but I sure fucking do.



holyfuckingshit im super high and I reeeeaaallly hope this made as much sense as I thought it did, but if it didn't just ignore me.....



P.S. I'm not even subbed to you on Twitch and after writing out this heartfelt comment about what you are doing made me realize I need to sub to you because I genuinely care about what you are doing here.

Luke, the fan.

1px8zvh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1px8zvh,Hypothetical new task: Serve Coffee Orders,"**The MIRA approved version of Make Cocktail task**

A new task that is similar to the Make Cocktail task but with extra steps, as the task uses similar mechanics of drink and serve like the Make Cocktail Task, but also includes a third new button to take coffee order from random crewmates.

The task is considered a long task and is a visual task, with people being able to see the finished coffees on the serving counter, which compensates for the task's tedious nature of multiple steps with a waiting period and repeating actions, this task is also only given to just a single crewmate.

**How to complete**

The task is done in a dedicated room of the café, which include a coffee roasting station, a coffee setting station, and the coffee serving counter, below is all the steps required to finish the task, each numbered by the order you likely would do.

1. At the coffee roasting station, open a bag of unroasted coffee beans, pour some onto a metal pan, and then roast them for 60 seconds.

2. While waiting for the coffee beans to finish roasting, go to the coffee serving counter to grab the notepad and pen on the table, which then leads you to gain a new button of Take Order above the use button.

3. With the new button, you go and take the coffee order of 3 random people, with you doing it similarly to how you interrogate a crewmate, except you use the Order Button instead.

4. After 60 seconds, you then take the roasted coffee beans from the pan and put them into a grinder in order to turn the roasted coffee beans into coffee powder, which is collected into a small metal tray under the grinder.

5. Then you go to the coffee setting station, where you would scoop some of the coffee powder into portafilters and then stick said portafilters into the expresso machine, which leads to a stream of coffee to fall into a ceramic cup under the machine.

6. Then you go the coffee serving counter, where you take that ceramic cup and then add addition based on the order written, with the addition includes water, milk, cream, and others, after you are finished, you then repeat step 5 and 6 for another two times.

7. After making three cups of coffee, you ring the bell beside it and the task will be counted as complete, the three people whose coffee order you have taken would see a yellow alert with a bell sound to notify them that their coffee is ready for consumption.

**Important Notes**

Unlike the cocktail bar, all of the stations used by the Serve Coffee Orders task are exclusive to the crewmates that have to do the task, as nobody is going to want to willingly take on this task if they can, you also may or may not serve coffee to Impostors when you are taking coffee orders.

If the coffee order of the person you have taken is dead, a yellow coffee alarm appears for anyone else, including the would-be barista, to take the leftover coffee and not waste it.

If the coffee server was killed or voted out, then the game would immediately consider the task to be completed even if you haven't even do step 1, but please don't kill yourself as a way from a task you don't like, because there is no other baristas in the company due to an ongoing coffee strike that is happening (they were paid below minimum wage with no benefits). 

**Caffeine rush**

For anyone in the MIRA HQ offices that wants a quick caffeine boost without wanting to wait for coffee, there is a coffee machine in every meeting room that anyone (including impostors) can access, with the only thing you need to do being to press a single button and wait 5 seconds for the coffee to pour into the cup, then you get the coffee which appears on your hands immediately.

Drinking coffee gives a temporary 30-120 second boost to the drinker's speed (the boost can be set from +0.05x speed to +0.15x speed), and reduces the cooldown for vitals, venting, tracking, killing, shapeshifting, and disappearing by 5-15 seconds, which can be the boost needed to escape an Impostor or catch a crewmate.

**Coffee jitters**

An optional setting to limit coffee consumption, which is caused by drinking more coffee than their tolerance level, which causes jitters to both movement and vision for 30-120 seconds, with the amount of coffee required to reach this point being either 1-5 drinks or a randomised amount, the effect can also be set to only effect crewmates.

Just got a Baby T Plus this week... What a nice machine and great coffee!



However, I find that it makes more noise than my previous rotary pump machine.

It is both the pump itself and also vibrations from various parts of the machine that makes more noise than expected.



I am thinking of trying to reduce the noise by using sound dampening feeds like the ones for speakers, vibration killers for cars in side panels, and maybe some rubber tape where sheet metal meets. But I am not sure if it is worth the effort?



Did any of you reduce the noise of your Baby T machines somehow? If so, it would be great if you can share what works for you.

Pictures are highly appreciated :-)

1px8w7u,https://www.reddit.com/r/urbancarliving/comments/1px8w7u/10_tips_for_living_in_your_car/,10 tips for living in your car,"1. Set an expiration date. Living in a car for 6 months warrants a totally different strategy than living in your car for 6 years or even 6 decades. Are you doing it for survival, for traveling the country, or just for the experience? These questions matter.

2. Don't pimp out your car and make it a moving apartment. This one might be controversial. But in my experience, I've tried living in a uhaul and I've tried living in a sedan, and the sedan life wins big time. Gas is expensive, for one thing, it's easier to fit in to society with a sedan for another thing, and at night it's much better to heat up the sedan than it is the uhaul.

3. Always be moving. If you're camped out too long in one spot, you're gonna piss of the locals and the neighbors. I never stayed in one spot for more than a few nights.

4. Enjoy the freedom and flexibility you now have! The US has a great interstate system for you to travel and tour the country. Take advantage of it now that you're no longer tied down.

5. Have a backup if your car needs to go to a mechanic. Have enough reserves to stay at a hotel or hostel if you have to. Your car is at the mechanic, there's not much you can do about that.

6. Have a PO box to collect your mail. This one's pretty straightforward, but don't think you can completely go off the grid. Make sure you have some sort of permanent address to collect mail. It could also be a friends or family members house.

7. Clean your poop/pee bucket daily! This one's important. No matter what, hygiene is #1. Don't let that slip away from your daily habits.

8. Pit stops, walmart parking lots, some public streets are your friend at night when you have to set up camp and sleep for the night.

9. Join a gig economy app to make some money while you're living in your car. I won't name any here because I don't want to endorse any, but there are plenty out there where you can make good money. Or just do freelance online and set up at a coffee shop and use their wifi.

10. If you're going to stay in someone's parking lot, be sure to buy something. They'll be much less likely to hassle you if you're a paying customer.

My favorite places to go:

Denver (all the ski bums sleep in their cars anyway instead of paying for a hotel)

San Francisco Bay Area (cost of living is so exorbitant you'll see van dwellers everywhere)

Chicago (good, midwestern values there and lots of transplants who feel your pain)

Places I'd avoid:

Vallejo (only Walmart in the Bay Area, but was super sketchy)

NYC (too much traffic)

1px8roh,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamesHoffmann/comments/1px8roh/coffee_pals_how_we_are_addressing_your_feedback/,Coffee Pals - How we are addressing your feedback,"Hey all - the other day I posted a link to Coffee Pals, an app I have been working on to refine coffee exchanges.  
  
**TL;DR:** 

* Re-worded homepage with clearer language  
* Geographic preferences are now per-exchange instead of global
* Added EU/EEA regional option for European users
* Made international shipping costs/customs crystal clear
* Added social sharing so you can easily invite friends
* and finally, user feedback

  \---

**Clearer Language - the monthly commitment:**

A lot of comments mentioned not wanting to commit to a monthly exchange - **I get it** \- the website now clarifies that exchanges are OPT OUT by default. Want to exchange every month, every other month, twice a year, or only at Christmas? All fine. Just log in when you want to exchange and opt in for that month. If you never sign in again, nothing will happen.

**The Big Change: Per-Exchange Geographic Preferences**

Instead of setting a single ""domestic or international"" preference in your profile that applies to all exchanges, you now choose your shipping preference each time you join an exchange.  
  
We realised people's preferences aren't static. Maybe you're happy to ship internationally in December when you're feeling generous, but want to keep it domestic in January when budgets are tight. Or perhaps you want to go international for a special exchange but keep it local for regular monthly swaps. Now you have that flexibility.

**New Option for European Users: EU/EEA Region**

  What's new: EU/EEA users now have three options instead of two:

*  Domestic - Within your country only
*  EU/EEA Region - Within EU/EEA + UK + Norway + Switzerland + Iceland
*  International - Worldwide

Shipping within the EU/EEA is often similar in cost and speed to domestic shipping, but gives you WAY more variety. You get the best of both worlds - manageable shipping costs without being limited to just your country. This was one of the most requested features in the comments.

**Crystal Clear Customs Warning**

When you select international shipping, you now see a prominent warning box explaining that packages may be subject to customs duties, taxes, or import fees at the destination - and that these charges are the recipient's responsibility.

You must acknowledge this before joining - we want everyone to understand what they're signing up for.

**Social Sharing Built In**

*  A ""Share Coffee Pals"" card on your dashboard
*  An ""Invite Friends"" card when you join an exchange
*  One-click sharing to Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, and Email
*  Easy copy-link functionality

Coffee Pals gets better with more people. We want to make it dead simple for you to invite friends who'd love this. Plus, there's something special about joining an exchange with people you know. If you're already in the beta - please share it with your friends :))

**User feedback**

* Replace 5 star rating with more appropriate rating system
* Award your match badges for going above and beyond
* Flag poor etiquette so an admin can intervene 

I replaced my previous 5 star rating system with a new updated system. The star rating worked fine in practice but we aren't ordering coffee from Amazon, we are sharing coffee with real people. The star system felt very transactional. The new system allows you to leave a note for your match to say thank you, award badges for being exceptional, or flag for admin intervention. If your match didn't send you anything, or sent you a bag of Starbucks beans, you can flag it. 

If you like what you are reading, you can still head over to [https://coffeepals.io/#waitlist](https://coffeepals.io/#waitlist) to sign up for beta and get in on the first exchange launching in January.

The phone is not, for the record, some elaborate skull-shaped monstrosity or a screaming crystal ball—I'm not a fucking amateur, and also Verizon doesn't support those.

“She's crying?"" I say, because apparently we need to establish basic facts, like I'm conducting a performance review for someone who's managed to fail at the one task in his job description. Menace. Threaten. Provide narrative obstacle. It's not complicated.

""Boss, she's—yeah, she's really crying, like, the kind where your whole face goes red and there's snot and—""

""Gary.""

""—and people are filming, Boss, there's like fifteen phones out, and—""

""Gary.""

He stops. There's a wet, snotty sound from the other end that I'm sincerely hoping is coming from the heroine and not from Gary himself.

Let me be clear about Gary: he's a seven-foot-tall amalgamation of shadow and teeth that I personally summoned from a dimension where mercy is a theoretical concept and compassion is considered a war crime. This is a creature who has consumed the souls of corrupt politicians (admittedly a target-rich environment) and dragged CEOs into eternal darkness mid-sentence during their quarterly earnings calls. He once reduced a megachurch pastor to gibbering terror just by looming nearby during a prosperity gospel sermon.

And now he's scared because a twenty-three-year-old with a magic sword and a destined bloodline is having a public breakdown.

""Where are you?"" I ask, already reaching for my keys. Normal keys, attached to a normal keychain from that art museum I went to last year.

""Outside the Duane Reade. The one with the—""

""There are dozens of Duane Reades in Manhattan, Gary.""

""The one with the broken sign. Where it just says 'Duan Rea'.""

I know exactly which one he means, which tells you something about how much time I spend navigating this godforsaken city's geography of mediocre pharmacy chains and artisanal everything. ""Don't move. Don't talk to anyone. Don't—"" I pause, because I'm watching him through the scrying mirror I keep on my desk and he's currently trying to pat the heroine's shoulder with one massive shadow-claw while an elderly woman offers her a tissue.

""She seems nice,"" Gary says, and I can hear something in his voice that sounds dangerously close to concern. I'm going to need to revisit our entire onboarding process, clearly. Maybe add a training module on maintaining professional boundaries during active hero-villain confrontations. Possibly a refresher on the concept of ""nemesis"" versus ""emotional support demon.""

The heroine is sitting on the curb now, face in her hands, and I can see her shoulders shaking beneath a jacket someone’s draped over her. There's a crowd forming that has that particular New York energy of people who are sixty percent concerned, thirty percent nosy, and ten percent hoping this goes viral enough to justify their witness testimony on a podcast later.

""I'm coming to get you,"" I tell Gary, who lets out a small, relieved sigh that would be endearing if it weren't coming from an entity that technically doesn't have lungs. ""Do not engage. Do not explain. If anyone asks, you're a—"" I look at him again, taking in the whole eldritch situation, ""—street performer whose bit went poorly.""

""Boss, I don't think—""

""Gary, I once convinced a police officer that a portal to the screaming void was an 'immersive theater experience' that had 'gotten a little too Method.' You'll be fine.""

""But what if she…asks me something? She keeps trying to talk and I don't know what to—""

""Then you nod sympathetically and make vague agreeable noises. You're a shadow demon, Gary. You literally emanate ambient dread. Use it to avoid conversation like any normal anxious person.""

I hang up before he can protest further. Stand. Look at my lair—which is really just a converted loft in Brooklyn with good light and exposed brick and the kind of industrial chic that costs a genuinely stupid amount per month—and wonder, not for the first time, if this is what a midlife crisis looks like when you've committed to a non-traditional career path.

My laptop is still open to the document I was working on: ""Project Starfall: Timeline and Escalation Protocols."" I'd been planning the heroine's next three trials, each carefully calibrated to push her toward her destiny without, you know, actually breaking her. It's a delicate balance. You want heroes who are tempered by adversity, not traumatized into therapy. Though honestly, therapy isn't a bad idea regardless. I should probably look into whether our confrontation insurance covers mental health benefits.

The thing is (and this is the part that none of the prophecies mention, the part that doesn't make it into the epic ballads or whatever): sometimes the heroine is just a kid. Sometimes she's twenty-three and working two jobs and probably has student loans and definitely has anxiety, and the universe has decided that she's the Chosen One, and maybe—just maybe—she's not having a great fucking day.

I grab my jacket—the North Face one, not the dramatically billowing one I wear for formal villain occasions—and check the mirror one more time. Gary is now holding what appears to be the heroine's iced coffee while she blows her nose. The elderly woman has been joined by what looks like her book club, and they've formed a protective semicircle around the scene. One of them is glaring at Gary with the kind of weaponized disapproval that only New York grandmothers can muster.

This is fine. Everything is fine.

I grab my phone. My keys. Try to remember if I locked the door to the ritual chamber. I should probably grab coffee on the way. This feels like a coffee situation. Maybe two coffees. One for me, one for the heroine. I have a feeling we're going to need to have a talk.",1,1766869767.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1px8nlw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Review/comments/1px8nlw/viking_danube_christmas_delights_budapest_to/,Viking Danube Christmas Delights (Budapest to Passau),"**TL;DR:** First cruise ever (river or ocean) and overall a very good experience. Viking does a lot right: clean ship, excellent staff, great shower, smooth logistics, and easy travel while you sleep. Downsides were rushed port stops, average-to-good (but repetitive) food, aggressive prepaid tipping practices, and nickel-and-diming during happy hour. Christmas markets were fun once, Budapest hot chocolate was incredible. Worth doing once, and we’d cruise again.

• Details: We took the Viking **Danube River Christmas Delights** cruise along the Danube River, traveling from Budapest, Hungary to Passau, Germany. The cruise itself ran from approximately December 9 through December 17, 2025.  Stops included Vienna, Linz, Salzburg, and several additional towns along the Danube. We were originally scheduled to sail on the GYMIR, but shortly before departure Viking reassigned us to the EDGIR. No explanation was given for the change, but it caused no issues and the EDGIR performed well throughout the trip. Check-in was smooth and efficient. We arrived after the stated 3:00 PM time, walked straight to the desk with no line, and were checked in immediately. Viking offered to deliver luggage to the stateroom, but we chose to carry our own bags to avoid waiting, which worked out perfectly.

• Stateroom/Accommodations: We chose one of the least expensive stateroom categories for two reasons: we’re cheap, and we were traveling with our kids, which required booking two rooms. Our cabin was on the lower level, right down the hall from staff areas. The room was very small but surprisingly comfortable and thoughtfully designed. Closet space allowed for roughly 15 hanging items per person (about 30 total), with three drawers and plenty of storage under the bed for luggage. There was also a mini-fridge, a makeup desk, multiple mirrors, and a small foyer-style changing area roughly 6 by 4 feet. There was just enough space to walk around the bed and open drawers, but barely. Being on the lower level, there was no balcony or sliding glass door—only two large windows set high on the wall, since the room sits mostly below the waterline. Lighting was excellent, with well-placed switches allowing full control from multiple locations, including the bed. The bed was high enough to store luggage underneath and included a protective mat for unpacking. Life jackets were stored under the bed (never needed). The mattress had a slightly lumpy, egg-crate style topper—not especially comfortable, but not uncomfortable either. Four pillows were provided; they didn’t work for me (very picky sleeper), but my wife had no issues. The bathroom was small but nicely finished, with a narrow but functional sink and countertop, a full-size wall-mounted toilet with an extremely loud flush (definitely not ideal at night), and an angled, tiled shower that felt surprisingly spacious. The handheld showerhead had amazing pressure and very hot water—honestly better than our shower at home. A full-length mirror was mounted on the back of the door, though winter coats hanging there partially blocked it. Overall, storage was more than adequate, and we were very happy not paying extra for a balcony since we were rarely in the room beyond sleeping and getting ready.

• Lounge / Happy Hour: Before lunch and dinner, most people gather in the lounge to relax. There is usually a bartender available, and in the evenings before dinner there is a pianist playing during “happy hour.” Because this was a Christmas market cruise, the music was mostly Christmas-themed. The musician was talented, playing both piano and saxophone, and while it’s not something you’d go out of your way for, it was enjoyable background entertainment. Viking also tries to keep things lively with trivia nights, Christmas games, a gingerbread house activity, and one evening they even brought in local performers for a fun Sound of Music–themed singalong that pulled guests into the act.

The big downside here is pricing. Viking charges for **all drinks during happy hour**, including non-alcoholic beverages, unless you have the alcohol package. Being charged **$6 for an iced tea** felt absurd and very nickel-and-dime. Charging for alcohol is understandable; charging that much for iced tea is not. On that note, I do **not** recommend the alcohol package. Wine and beer are already included with lunch and dinner, and since you’re off the boat much of the day, you’d have to drink an excessive amount at happy hour to get any value. I don’t drink, my wife does, and there was no realistic way the package made sense for us unless the goal was to get sloppy drunk every evening.

• Restaurant/Food: Overall, the food was good but not great. It felt impressive at first, but over time became fairly routine and somewhat monotonous. Viking offers two dinner menus nightly: a rotating local menu tied to the port, and a standing “always available” menu with safe options like a ribeye steak or burger. This fallback menu was useful if the local options didn’t appeal. Breakfast in the main restaurant included a made-to-order omelet station, buffet, and printed menu, though most people stuck with the buffet and omelets. Options included oatmeal, pancakes (banana, blueberry, or chocolate), eggs to order, smoked salmon daily, breads, and plenty of fruit. Some mornings featured items like fried rice or beans and vegetables, which felt odd but were popular with some guests.

An early, minimal breakfast starts around 6:00 AM in the Aquavit area with cold cuts, yogurt, a cold oatmeal-style dish, coffee, juice, and muffins (blueberry ran out after several days, leaving only chocolate). Lunch and dinner are served in the main restaurant, but one downside is that Viking gives a dinner start time with no posted end time or last seating. One night dinner began at 6:00 PM; we went down around 7:30 and found service was over and we were essentially locked out of dinner, which was frustrating. Seating is communal, typically six to ten people per table, which we actually enjoyed and made it easy to meet people. In addition to the main restaurant, the Aquavit area offers casual meals and basic dinner options like burgers. There is also a small café station near the lounge with a few muffins, occasional fruit, and an excellent self-serve espresso, coffee, and hot chocolate machine. Wine, beer, and non-alcoholic drinks are included with all meals even without the alcohol package. Service was attentive, though the repeated scripted jokes wore thin. Overall, food was about a 7/10.

• Port Calls: Viking offers many port stops along this route, and overall they were very good, though everything felt a bit rushed. Included excursions are mostly guided bus tours with walking portions and a local guide providing context. Paid excursions are longer, often farther away, and include transportation, a guide, and limited free time. We mostly did the included tours and explored on our own, with the exception of the paid Salzburg excursion, which was excellent. That trip included a drive on the Autobahn, though traffic was heavy and nothing wild happened. The main drawback of the port calls is the lack of free time. Salzburg, for example, gave us only about an hour and twenty minutes on our own, which felt extremely rushed and forced our group to split up. Many stops blended together—beautiful churches, amazing architecture, charming cobblestones—but little time to absorb what made each place unique. This is probably inherent to river cruising, where the goal is sampling many destinations rather than deeply exploring one.

• Staff: The staff on the Viking EDGIR was excellent. Our stateroom attendant learned our names almost immediately and addressed us by name throughout the trip. Daily cleaning was offered, though we opted for every other day. Bartenders were friendly, fun, and engaging. Staff overall were helpful, attentive, and always smiling. One minor oddity occurred early in the mornings around 6:00 AM in the Aquavit area, when a staff member vacuumed the lounge—including directly under our feet while we were sitting there—which felt unnecessary given the empty space. Aside from that, service was consistently strong. Overall, staff earns a solid 9/10.

• Tipping: Viking strongly encourages a “prepaid gratuity” at booking. While technically optional, if you decline it, Viking will still add it to your onboard bill later, which we did not appreciate. We learned that Viking guarantees staff a certain gratuity level as part of their compensation, and prepaid tips are used to fulfill Viking’s own obligation—not as extra tips directly benefiting the crew. Because of this, we believe guests are better off declining the prepaid gratuity and tipping staff directly in cash at the end. Viking will remove the automatic gratuity without resistance if asked, but they clearly push hard for prepayment. This lack of transparency feels slimy. Staff clearly hope for direct tipping regardless, and Viking provides envelopes for this purpose. If you want to reward a specific staff member, hand them cash directly. This was the most disappointing part of the Viking experience for us.

• Christmas Markets: There were Christmas markets at every stop, and while they were fun to walk through, I personally didn’t care much about them. My wife loved them, and some were definitely better than others. Some markets were food-focused, others were mostly ornaments and trinkets. One market in Linz was geared toward children and was downright terrible—small rides, limited food, and swap-meet-style booths selling soccer jerseys and cheap T-shirts. Otherwise, the markets tend to blend together, and many people enjoy collecting the commemorative mugs—we came home with 15–20 of them. Budapest was the standout. The hot chocolate there was incredible—thick enough for a spoon to stand upright, rich, and topped with excellent whipped cream. Nothing else on the trip came close.

• In Summary: This was our first cruise of any kind—river or ocean—and overall Viking did an excellent job. We were very pleased with the experience and met many great people, including frequent Viking cruisers (one guy was on his 14th Viking cruise). The ports were enjoyable, cruising at night while sleeping was fantastic, and daytime cruising was clearly planned around scenic stretches. Included tours and local guides were excellent. The ship was clean, the stateroom worked well, the shower was phenomenal, and the staff was consistently strong. The Christmas markets were a bucket-list experience, and we’re glad we did it once. Overall, we would recommend this trip and are open to cruising again in the future, Viking or otherwise.  Viking is a big ""for profit"" company and much of that shows in a negative way...but sort of expected.

For the first 6 months we were long distance then he moved back about 20mins away. His family live about 40mins from him in the opposite direction (so about an hour from me) 

11months ago after putting a bit of pressure on him I met his parents for 5mins and we only had the chance to say literally about 10 words to each other. He said his parents liked me. 

9months later after some more pressure I was introduced to a couple of his friends briefly. We had a coffee with one of them for a slightly longer time. He said his friends liked me. 

I still haven’t met his 2 children. (1 adult and one almost adult) He assures me they know about me and I heard him mention my name to one of them on the phone before so I assume they do know. But that’s all the inroads I’ve been allowed to have into his life. He met my parents/siblings/children/friends multiple times (not usually spending huge amounts of time but certainly getting to know each other a bit) 

we only see each other once a week and pretty much always on his terms. He fairly regularly makes plans then changes them last min. Very often he comes over in the evening and goes to sleep early so our waking time together is limited. We have days out sometimes and we have such a lovely time together. I wish we could do that more and he agrees he wants to do it more but I don’t feel like there’s any effort to spend more time together. 

I was in a very abusive relationship before this and he is so different. very kind and gentle. Quiet, patient and Understanding with me but I’m always scared that he’s angry with me or doesn’t like me. I work very hard not to make this an issue in our relationship but it leaves me feeling very alone sometimes and not able to say things I would like to say. As a result I don’t feel like I’m part of his life. The two times I have brought it up he arranged the 5min meet up with his parents and then the meeting with some friends. So in 18months perhaps an hour and 5mins total spent with the people in his life and nothing at all with his kids or sibling. I’ve never been in a relationship like this and I almost don’t feel like I am IN a relationship.

I really am very committed to being with this man but people are drawing my attention to these “red flags” 

I want to add I’m 100% positive that he doesn’t have another girlfriend or anything like that.  ",1,1766869462.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

1px8gh5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Clavicular/comments/1px8gh5/to_improve_our_discourse_here_are_the_common/,"To improve our discourse, here are the common logical fallacies","After my brief time here, I've encountered many people using logical fallacies. I'd like to educate you. Enjoy, and thank you.

# 1 Ad hominem

An ad hominem fallacy is one that attempts to invalidate an opponent’s position based on a personal trait or fact about the opponent rather than through logic. 

**Example:** Katherine is a bad choice for mayor because she didn’t grow up in this town. 

# 2 Red herring

A [red herring](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/rhetorical-devices/red-herring-fallacy/) is an attempt to shift focus from the debate at hand by introducing an irrelevant point. 

**Example:** Losing a tooth can be scary, but have you heard about the Tooth Fairy? 

# 3 Straw man

A[ straw man argument](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/rhetorical-devices/straw-man-fallacy/) is one that argues against a hyperbolic, inaccurate version of the opposition rather than their actual argument. 

**Example:** Erin thinks we need to stop using all plastics, right now, to save the planet from climate change. 

# 4 Equivocation

An equivocation is a statement crafted to mislead or confuse readers or listeners by using multiple meanings or interpretations of a word or simply through unclear phrasing. 

**Example:** While I have a clear plan for the campus budget that accounts for every dollar spent, my opponent simply wants to throw money at special interest projects. 

# 5 Slippery slope

With a slippery slope fallacy, the arguer claims a specific series of events will follow one starting point, typically with no supporting evidence for this chain of events. 

**Example:** If we make an exception for Bijal’s service dog, then other people will want to bring their dogs. Then everybody will bring their dog, and before you know it, our restaurant will be overrun with dogs, their slobber, their hair, and all the noise they make, and nobody will want to eat here anymore. 

# 6 Hasty generalization

A [hasty generalization](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/rhetorical-devices/hasty-generalization-fallacy/) is a statement made after considering just one or a few examples rather than relying on more extensive research to back up the claim. It’s important to keep in mind that what constitutes sufficient research depends on the issue at hand and the statement being made about it. 

**Example:** I felt [nauseated](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/commonly-confused-words/nauseated-vs-nauseous/) both times I ate pizza from Georgio’s, so I must be allergic to something in pizza. 

# 7 Appeal to authority

In an [appeal to authority](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/rhetorical-devices/appeal-to-authority-fallacy/), the arguer claims an authority figure’s expertise to support a claim despite this expertise being irrelevant or overstated. 

**Example:** If you want to be healthy, you need to stop drinking coffee. I read it on a fitness blog. 

# 8 False dilemma

A false dilemma, also known as a false dichotomy, claims there are only two options in a given situation. Often, these two options are extreme opposites of each other, failing to acknowledge that other, more reasonable, options exist. 

**Example:** If you don’t support my decision, you were never really my friend. 

# 9 Bandwagon fallacy

With the bandwagon fallacy, the arguer claims that a certain action is the right thing to do because it’s popular. 

**Example:** Of course it’s fine to wait until the last minute to write your paper. Everybody does it!

# 10 Appeal to ignorance

An [appeal to ignorance](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/rhetorical-devices/appeal-to-ignorance-fallacy/) is a claim that something must be true because it hasn’t been proven false. It can also be a claim that something must be false because it hasn’t been proven true. This is also known as the burden of proof fallacy. 

**Example:** There must be fairies living in our attic because nobody’s ever proven that there aren’t fairies living in our attic.

# 11 Circular argument

A circular argument is one that uses the same statement as both the premise and the conclusion. No new information or justification is introduced. 

**Example:** Peppers are the easiest vegetable to grow because I think peppers are the easiest vegetable to grow. 

# 12 Sunk cost fallacy

With the sunk cost fallacy, the arguer justifies their decision to continue a specific course of action by the amount of time or money they’ve already spent on it. 

**Example:** I’m not enjoying this book, but I bought it, so I have to finish reading it. 

# 13 Appeal to pity

An appeal to pity attempts to sway a reader’s or listener’s opinion by provoking them emotionally. 

**Example:** I know I should have been on time for the interview, but I woke up late and felt really bad about it, then the stress of being late made it hard to concentrate on driving here.

# 14 Causal fallacy

A [causal fallacy](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/rhetorical-devices/causal-fallacy/) is one that implies a relationship between two things where one can’t actually be proven. 

**Example:** When ice cream sales are up, so are shark attacks. Therefore, buying ice cream increases your risk of being bitten by a shark. 

# 15 Appeal to hypocrisy

An [appeal to hypocrisy](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/rhetorical-devices/appeal-to-hypocrisy/), also known as a tu quoque fallacy, is a rebuttal that responds to one claim with reactive criticism rather than with a response to the claim itself. 

**Example:** “You don’t have enough experience to be the new leader.” “Neither do you!”

Although this list covers the most commonly seen logical fallacies, it’s not exhaustive. Other logical fallacies include the *no true* *Scotsman* fallacy (“New Yorkers fold their pizza, so you must not really be from New York if you eat yours with utensils.”) and the *Texas sharpshooter* fallacy (cherry-picking data to support a claim rather than drawing a logical conclusion from a broad body of evidence). ",2,1766869204.0,Clavicular,0,1.0,False

I'm 32M and I live just outside Inverness in the Black Isle.  Due to usual life commitments, my lifelong school friends aren't always available to hang out. I'd love to branch out a bit, but have some mobility issues and also can't drive.

The usual suggestions seem to be walking groups, but due to my mobility issues this doesn't seem possible for now..  I've also seen things like board games groups being suggested.

Quick stuff like Trivial Pursuit and Cluedo. I also enjoy games like Codenames, Exploding Kittens, and Muffin time.

I'm also interested in more informal meetups like meeting up for something like coffee or lunch, really just anything that creates opportunities to meet like-minded people. Some of my interests include gaming, chess, board and card games, and going to cafés. I also really enjoy snooker and pool.

1a. Manual Programming::No memory retention for next brew

I did a manual program for a new set of beans that I ground. I held the double shot button for about 8-9 seconds, and I noticed that my first drop of coffee comes in at the 14th second or so. I let it run for about 25 to 27 seconds when I eyeball the crema looks about right. However, for my next brew, the machine does not remember the settings. Sometimes it'll give me a single shot pour despite me pressing the double shot button, and there's a weird sound that comes (a 'plop' sound) from the machine. It's so strange. Is there a way i can 'factory reset' the machine?

  
1b. Manual Programming::Light flashes for single shot when programming for double shot (sometimes)

When I am manually programming for the double shot, should the light be flashing for the single shot or the double shot button? It's strange that sometimes the light flashes for the single shot button, and other times it does for the double shot button. At this point, I'm getting a bit frustrated

  
2. Stuck Puck

1px8ajq,https://i.redd.it/8ytzu0lz7t9g1.jpeg,I was wrong 💔,"I used to chase perfection. 🍂

​Early in my roasting journey, I tried to force Community Coffee to be something it wasn’t. I wanted it to go head-to-head with high-end Specialty Coffee, and honestly? It led to frustration.

​But then, the perspective shifted.

​I realized that Community Coffee isn’t about ticking boxes on a score sheet. It’s about SOUL. It’s about honoring the hard labor of our farmers and bringing out the absolute best in what nature provided.

​By embracing these beans—imperfections and all—we help farmers clear their stock and fuel their cycle of growth. And the taste? It gives specialty coffee a serious run for its money, at a fraction of the price!

​A little note to my Malarayat Coffee brewers:

You might notice slight variations in roast color. Since these beans are consolidated by different local farmers (a natural pre-blend!), diversity is part of the package. But don't worry—I’ve spent hours sorting out the bad beans so that every cup you brew is clean, delicious, and full of heart. 🤎

I have just seen your video with James Hoffman on the hot and cold coffee dish. I had my 40th birthday at The Fat Duck in 2010 and it was one of the most memorable nights of my life. I often describe it as the most expensive, but also the best value meal of my life so I am  well aware of the crazy magic you are capable of.

I would love to try and make the hot and cold coffee using your gums and Cometeer coffee, but I am spending the winter kitesurfing in Kalpitiya in Sri Lanka. What are the chances of shipping to Sri Lanka? Although it's very, very remote here, most of the roads are just sand I'm just about managing to make decent coffee and have found an Indian copy of a Bamix stick blender. Does this sound doable?, on so many levels.

I almost see it as the ultimate proof of concept of your recipe. If I can pull it off here in the absolute back of beyond where you see more cows and donkeys on the roads than cars then anyone can do it.

I think it would blow the locals' minds. I'd love to see the looks on their faces.

1px7v73,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1px7v73,"The 20-Byte ""Heist"": Why Calling AI an ""Art Thief"" is Nonsense","The outrage over AI image generation ""stealing"" art is an emotional reaction divorced from technical reality. The truth is, calling an AI model an ""art thief"" is as absurd as calling a human memory a copy machine.

Let's break down the sheer impossibility of the claim. The widely-used SDXL image model was trained on approximately 400 million images. Yet, the entire model—its ""knowledge""—only requires about 8GB of storage for its weights.

To do the math: 8,000 megabytes divided by 400 million images. That breaks down to an average of **20 bytes** of data stored per image in the model's structure.

Twenty bytes.

To put that in perspective, the paragraph you just read is over ten times that size. A single, low-resolution JPEG of a coffee mug is orders of magnitude larger. Twenty bytes is less information than this sentence.

When you train a large language model, it doesn't save a thumbnail of every image it sees. Instead, it extracts ultra-condensed statistical patterns—the deep structure of ""what makes a wave a wave,"" or ""the common elements of a dramatic portrait."" The resulting AI is a brilliant, complex statistical abstraction machine, not a data storage locker full of purloined JPEGs.

To accuse the AI of ""stealing"" art based on 20 bytes of abstraction is to fundamentally misunderstand what machine learning is and how it functions. It's not a pirate with a hard drive full of unauthorized files; it's a highly compressed, emergent statistical *understanding* of human visual culture. The real bad guy here is hyperbole, not the algorithm.",81,1766867668.0,accelerate,76,0.84,False

I’m looking for a book I read probably early 2000s/2010 ish? I was around 8/9 but a somewhat advanced reader so it’s possible the book was meant for older readers. I think it might have been a series with 2 or 3 books? At the time I was really into Wendy Mass, The Mysterious Benedict Society, ASOUE, so I suspect it was that sort of vibe.

The plot: it was about a family (dad, some kids) and they were all geniuses…I think? Possibly they all had superpowers. The big plot point was that their mom had died, and they thought it was because she had drunk poisoned coffee brought to her by some agent from some government agency. The family was trying to prove that she had been murdered and I *think* was trying to travel back in time to prevent her death.

The only real scene I remember was from the opening of the book. I’m pretty sure they were moving, and the younger brother was complaining that his gum was stuck to the wall/his bedframe, and his dad/sister told him to heat it up with a hot air dryer, as it would loosen the gum. I remember this every time I have to peel something sticky away from a surface.

Alcoholism kind of runs in the family (grandfather, uncles,...), aided by the culture I grew up in. I cut contact with my parents and am working on my issues with trust in therapy. I had very unhealthy drinking habits in my teenage years, but barely had alcohol for a couple of years now, even lived completly sober for Over a year. 

  
I nowadays drink sometimes when I am out with friends, but not much and not always. I sometimes have a beer at home after work by myself (feel especially guilty about this, because that is what my parents did, but obviously they had more than one drink). I am just having a glass of wine I got for Christmas in front of the TV and am like wow, I really can't enjoy this because I feel like I am an alcoholic already, drinking alone. 

The joke is: I have never been addicted to anything and even stop drinking coffee, every time I realize I get addicted to it. And I hate how much I am looking for validation in this group now, because I should just find this validation in me. Ugh!

So just wondering, how is is your relationship with alcohol? I also find it super difficult to be around friends who tend to drink often or a lot...

Grinder: Eureka Mignon Zero (grind setting set to essentially zero)

Have up to a $2M budget for home. Here is the very specific criteria I’m looking for:

\- ocean ideally walkable, but at least within a 20 minute drive

\- if ocean proximity with good schools is not possible, then directly on a lake with a lake view.

\- within 3 hour drive of a major airport

\- big enough house (at least 3250 sf) for that budget 

\- enough things to do: restaurants, coffee shops, etc…(don’t go out much so not a huge deal)

Other helpful info:

\- wife and I both work remote and always will, so we don’t need to be near any industries or jobs

\- currently live in coastal MA. Love everything except the cold. Love the ocean, good schools, pretty towns / vibes. Want something as close as possible to that.

I think someone else connected with him instead.","It started with good intentions. That’s the sick joke of it all.

My son is sixteen. And if you have a sixteen-year-old, you know what I mean when I say he’s a stranger living in my house. He exists in a self-contained universe of glowing screens, muffled bass from his headphones, and monosyllabic grunts that pass for communication. We used to be close. When he was little, he was my shadow. Now, I’m just the guy who pays for the Wi-Fi.

The distance between us had become a canyon, and I was terrified that one day I’d look across and not be able to see the other side at all. I had to do something. So I fell back on the only thing I knew, the only real template for fatherhood I ever had.

My own father was a grim man. Not cruel, not abusive, just… silent. He was a block of granite, weathered and hard, and you could spend a lifetime chipping away and never find the core of him. He worked a hard-labor job, came home, ate his dinner while staring at the wall, and spent his weekends either fixing things in the garage or just sitting on the porch. The only time he ever seemed to unthaw, the only time I felt anything like a connection, was when he took me hunting.

He’d take me to a vast, sprawling state forest a few hours from our house. We’d walk for miles, not really hunting anything specific, just walking. He’d point out tracks, identify bird calls, show me which mushrooms would kill you and which you could eat. He spoke more in those woods in a single weekend than he would in a month at home. It was our place. His church.

He’s gone now. Been gone twenty years. I’ll get to that.

So, I decided to take my son to the same woods. I pitched it as a ""digital detox"" camping and hunting trip. He complained, of course. A weekend without signal was, to him, a fate worse than death. But I bribed him with a new, expensive hunting knife he’d been wanting, and with a weary sigh, he agreed.

The first day was… okay. Awkward. The silence in the car was heavy. When we got there and started hiking in, he kept pulling out his phone, trying to find a bar of service, his face a mask of frustration. I just kept walking, trying to channel my old man’s patience.

""Look,"" I said, pointing. ""Deer tracks. A doe and a fawn, see how small the second set is?""

He glanced, gave a noncommittal ""huh,"" and went back to his phone.

My heart sank. This was a mistake. I was trying to force a memory that wasn’t his, trying to fit him into a mold my own father had made for me.

But then, a few hours in, something shifted. The deeper we got, the more the silence of the woods seemed to swallow the silence between us. His phone was useless, a dead brick in his pocket. He finally put it away. He started to look around. He asked me what kind of tree a particularly massive, gnarled oak was. He asked if there were bears out here. We talked. Actually talked. About school, about some girl he liked, about the stupid video games he played. It was stilted and clumsy, but it was a conversation, a start even. A fragile bridge across the canyon.

By late afternoon, we were miles from any marked trail. This was how my father did it. He believed the real woods didn't start until you couldn't hear the highway anymore. The air grew cooler, thick with the smell of damp earth and decaying leaves. The sunlight, filtered through the dense canopy, painted the forest floor in shifting patterns of green and gold. It was beautiful. Peaceful. I felt the tension in my shoulders, a knot I hadn't realized I’d been carrying for years, finally begin to loosen. My son seemed to feel it too. He was walking with a lighter step, his head up, taking it all in.

""It's... pretty quiet out here,"" he said as an observation.

""It is,"" I replied, smiling. ""It's the kind of quiet that's full of sound, if you listen.""

We were walking through a part of the forest I’d never been to, even with my father. The trees were older here, thicker. Their branches were heavy with moss that hung down like old men’s beards. The ground was a spongy carpet of fallen needles. It felt ancient, untouched.

That’s when he saw it.

""Dad, what the hell is that?""

He was pointing off to our left, maybe fifty yards into a thicket of ferns. I followed his gaze, and my breath caught in my throat.

Hanging from the thick, low-slung branch of a colossal pine was… a thing. It’s hard to describe. At first glance, it looked like a massive, oversized cocoon or hornet’s nest. It was roughly human-sized, maybe a little over six feet long, and hung vertically. But it wasn't made of paper or silk. It seemed to be woven from the forest itself. Moss, pine needles, strips of bark, and thick, fibrous vines were all matted together with some kind of dark, hardened secretion that looked like dried sap. It was a grotesque parody of a chrysalis, a lumpy, organic pod that was a deep, sickly green-brown, perfectly camouflaged against the tree trunk behind it. It just… felt wrong. Deeply, fundamentally wrong. 

A primal alarm bell went off in the deepest part of my brain. The kind of instinct that kept our ancestors alive when they heard a rustle in the tall grass.

""Don't,"" I said, my voice low and urgent. ""Stay here.""

But he's sixteen. ""Don't"" is an invitation. He was already pushing through the ferns, his earlier apathy replaced by a morbid, fearless curiosity.

""No, seriously,"" I snapped, harsher this time. ""Get back here. Now.""

""Just want to see what it is,"" he called back, not even looking at me. ""It's weird.""

I hurried after him, my heart hammering against my ribs. ""We don't know what it is. It could be a nest for something dangerous. Back away from it.""

He was standing right in front of it now, looking up. From up close, it was even worse. You could see the intricate weaving of the fibers, the way small twigs and dead leaves were incorporated into its structure. It swayed ever so slightly in the breeze, a silent, monstrous pendulum. There was a faint, cloying smell coming from it, like rotting mushrooms and wet soil.

""I'm just gonna poke it,"" he said, reaching for a stick.

""You will not,"" I said, grabbing his arm. My voice was trembling. I couldn't explain my fear. It was an absolute, unreasoning terror. ""We're leaving. We're turning around and we're leaving right now.""

He pulled his arm away, a flash of defiance in his eyes. The connection we had started to build was crumbling, replaced by the old wall of teenage rebellion. ""Why? You're being weird. It's probably just some weird fungus or something.""

""It's not fungus,"" I said. ""We're going.""

He ignored me. Before I could stop him, he’d pulled out the new hunting knife I’d given him. The polished steel glinted in the dim light.

""What are you doing?"" I hissed.

""I want to see what's inside,"" he said, his voice steady. He was completely focused on the cocoon, his face a mask of intense concentration.

I should have tackled him. I should have dragged him away. But I was frozen, paralyzed by that deep, animal fear and a sudden, sickening premonition. I watched, helpless, as he reached up and pressed the tip of the knife into the lower part of the pod.

It wasn't tough. The blade sank in with a wet, tearing sound, like cutting through damp cardboard. He pulled the knife down, creating a long, vertical slit. The smell intensified, a wave of damp decay washing over us.

He worked the knife, widening the opening. Something dark and brittle shifted inside. He put his knife away and, with a grimace, used both hands to pull the two sides of the slit apart.

The contents spilled out onto the forest floor with a dry, hollow rattle.

It was a human skeleton.

The bones were clean, bleached to a pale yellowish-white, but stained in places with dark green and brown patches, as if the very substance of the cocoon had seeped into them. They were tangled with the same fibrous, vine-like material from the pod's exterior, which seemed to have grown through the ribcage and around the long bones of the arms and legs. A few scraps of what might have been clothing—denim, maybe flannel—were fused into the matted material, almost indistinguishable from the bark and leaves. The skull rolled a few inches away and came to rest facing up, its empty eye sockets staring at the canopy above.

We both stood there, utterly silent, the sound of our own breathing loud in the still air. The quiet of the woods was menacing. The bridge between us had reappeared, but this time it was built of shared horror. My son looked pale, his bravado completely gone, replaced by a sick, green tinge. He stumbled back, his hand over his mouth.

It took us a few minutes to get our wits back. I fumbled for my phone, which was useless. We had to hike back. We marked the spot as best we could and then we walked, fast. We didn't talk. The only sounds were our footsteps, frantic and loud on the forest floor. The woods felt different now. Every shadow seemed to stretch, every rustle of leaves sounded like something following us. I felt a thousand unseen eyes on my back.

We made it to a ridge with a single bar of service and called 911. They routed us to the park rangers. I explained what we found, my voice shaking. They took our location and told us to wait by the main trail.

Two rangers met us an hour later. They were calm, professional. They took our statements. We led them back to the site. They looked at the skeleton, at the bizarre cocoon hanging in tatters from the branch. One of them poked at it with a stick.

""Never seen anything like this,"" he said to his partner, his face impassive. ""The nest, I mean.""

""Some kind of insect?"" the other asked.

""Not one I know. We'll have the forensics team come out. Probably some missing hiker from years back. Sad business.""

They told us we were free to go, that they'd contact us if they needed more information. And that was it. They were treating it like a tragic but ultimately explainable event. A hiker gets lost, dies of exposure, and some strange, undiscovered insect or fungus makes a nest out of the remains. It sounded almost plausible, if you didn't look too closely at the thing, if you hadn't felt that unnatural dread in its presence.

We hiked back to our planned campsite, neither of us wanting to abandon the trip entirely. It felt like admitting defeat, like letting the horror win. But the mood was ruined. The easy connection we’d found was gone, replaced by a shared, unspoken trauma.

We set up the tent and built a fire. The flames pushed back the encroaching darkness, but it felt like a flimsy defense. The woods pressed in, black and silent, just beyond the ring of light.

My son sat on a log, poking the fire with a stick. He was quiet again, but it was a different kind of quiet. Not the sullen, withdrawn silence of a teenager, but something deeper, more thoughtful. More… somber.

""Dad?"" he said, his voice soft. ""You never really told me how grandpa died.""

The question hit me like a physical blow. The timing of it, here, in this place, after what we’d just seen. My blood ran cold.

I took a deep breath. ""He, uh… he got sick.""

""Sick how?""

""His mind,"" I said, struggling for the words. ""He got Alzheimer's. Early onset. He was only in his late fifties. It was… fast. One day he was just my quiet, grim old man. A few years later, he was… gone. Even when he was sitting right in front of me.""

The fire crackled, spitting embers into the night sky.

""He was always a loner,"" I continued, the memories flooding back, sharp and painful. ""But the sickness made it worse. He'd get confused, agitated. He'd wander. One day, he just… walked out of the house. Mom was in the garden for maybe twenty minutes. When she came back in, he was gone.""

My son looked at me, his eyes reflecting the firelight. He was completely still.

""They searched for him. Police, volunteers, everyone. They had dogs. They found his tracks leading from the house to the edge of the woods. These woods."" I gestured out into the blackness around us. ""His trail went in, and it just… stopped. They never found anything. Not a shoe, not a piece of clothing. Nothing. He just vanished in here.""

We sat in silence for a long time after that. The weight of my story, combined with the skeleton in the woods, settled over our campsite like a shroud. I watched my son. He was staring into the flames, his expression unreadable. But something about his posture, the way he held his shoulders, the set of his jaw… it sent a chill down my spine. It was eerily familiar.

It was the way my father used to sit.

I tried to shake it off. He’s in shock. We both are. He’s just processing what I told him. It’s a coincidence.

But the feeling wouldn't go away.

Later, as we were getting ready to turn in, the strangeness started. I was shivering, a bit of a chill in the air. I opened my mouth to ask him if he wanted another blanket from the car, the thought just forming in my head.

Before a single word came out, he said, without looking up from unlacing his boots, ""I'm not cold.""

I froze. ""What?""

""I'm fine,"" he said, his voice flat. He didn't seem to notice anything odd about it.

I dismissed it. A lucky guess. We’re father and son, maybe we were just on the same wavelength. But it happened again a few minutes later. I was thinking about the long hike back in the morning, wondering if we should pack up camp tonight and just sleep in the car. It was a fleeting, internal debate.

""We should stay,"" he said, his voice quiet but firm, as if responding to a spoken question. ""It's better to get an early start when it's light out.""

This time, a genuine spike of fear shot through me. I stared at him. He was laying out his sleeping bag in the tent, his movements economical and precise. There was a lack of wasted motion about him that was profoundly unfamiliar. My son was a creature of sprawling limbs and clumsy energy. This was… different. Contained and controlled.

""How did you know I was thinking that?"" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.

He finally looked at me. His eyes seemed… older. The playful spark, the teenage angst, it was all gone. Replaced by a flat, weary emptiness. ""Just figured,"" he said, and turned away.

I didn't sleep that night. I lay in my sleeping bag, my body rigid, listening to the sound of his slow, even breathing from the other side of the small tent. Every nocturnal snap of a twig, every hoot of a distant owl, sounded like a threat. I kept replaying the events of the day in my head. The cocoon. The skeleton. My father’s disappearance. My son’s changing demeanor. The pieces were all there, scattered on the floor of my mind, and they were beginning to form a picture I did not want to see.

The next morning, it was worse.

He was up before me, which never happens. He had already packed his sleeping bag and was sitting by the dead fire, nursing a cup of instant coffee. He didn't greet me. He just nodded, a short, clipped gesture. It was my father’s nod. I’d received that same nod a thousand times as a boy.

We packed up the rest of the camp in near silence. The change was undeniable now. He didn’t slouch. He didn’t drag his feet. He worked efficiently, his face a hard mask. He looked at the woods around us with a kind of quiet, grim familiarity.

""We should head north-east,"" he said, pointing through the trees. ""It's a more direct route to the trail. Shave an hour off the walk.""

He was right. But I had been the one poring over the map the night before. He’d barely glanced at it. How could he know that?

""How do you know that?"" I asked, my voice tight.

He squinted, looking up at the position of the sun. ""Just a feeling. This way's better.""

And then he did it. He rubbed the back of his neck with his left hand, a specific, peculiar gesture my father always made when he was thinking or feeling uneasy. A habit I hadn't seen in twenty years.

I felt like the ground had dropped out from under me. This wasn't shock. This wasn't my son processing trauma. Something was fundamentally, terrifyingly wrong.

We started walking. He took the lead. He moved through the undergrowth with a confidence that made no sense. He wasn't the city kid who’d been complaining about bugs yesterday. He moved like he belonged here. Like he’d walked these paths his entire life.

My mind was racing, trying to find a rational explanation. A psychotic break? Shared delusion? But the cold, hard reality of his mannerisms, of his impossible knowledge, defied any easy answer.

I had to know. I had to test it.

""Did you... did you sleep okay?"" I asked, my voice barely a whisper.

He didn't turn around. ""Fine. Dreamt of the war.""

I stopped dead. My blood turned to ice water.

""What?""

He stopped and turned to face me. The look on his face was not my son's. It was a tired, haunted look I knew all too well. It was the look in my father's eyes in his last few years, when the fog of his disease was thick.

""The war,"" he repeated, his voice raspy, unfamiliar. ""The heat. The noise.""

My father had served in Vietnam. He never, ever spoke of it. Not once. But my mother told me he had terrible nightmares his whole life. My son knew none of this. I'd never told him.

This was it. The precipice. I was either losing my mind, or I was speaking to something that was not my child. I took a shaky breath, my heart feeling like it was going to beat its way out of my chest. I decided to take the leap. I decided to speak to the ghost.

""Dad?"" I said, the word feeling alien and terrifying in my mouth.

The face that was my son's twisted. For a second, it was him again, a flash of pure confusion and fear in his eyes. ""Dad, what's...?"" And then it was gone, submerged. The grim, empty mask was back. The eyes focused on me, but they were looking from a great distance.

""You shouldn't have brought the boy here,"" the voice said. It was my son's voice, but the cadence was all wrong. It was slow, gravelly. It was my father's.

Tears streamed down my face. A horrifying mix of grief and terror. ""What happened to you? What is this place?""

He—it—looked around at the ancient trees, a flicker of profound fear in those old eyes. ""It's hungry,"" he whispered. ""It's always hungry.""

""What is?"" I begged. ""The thing in the tree? What did it do to you?""

""It doesn't move fast,"" the voice rasped, ignoring my question. ""It's patient. It gets in your head. I was... lost. Confused. The sickness... it made it easy for it. It finds the ones that are already fading and promises... clarity. A way back.""

A memory surfaced, sharp and terrible. One of my last clear conversations with my father before the Alzheimer's took him completely. He’d been staring out the window, looking towards the hills where these woods lay. ""I just need to get back there,"" he'd mumbled. ""It's clearer there. I can think there."" We'd thought he was just confused, longing for his youth.

""It led me,"" the voice continued, a tremor running through my son's body. ""Deep in. Talked to me.  In... thoughts. Showed me things. Things I'd forgotten. My own father's face. The day you were born.""

The voice hitched. ""It felt good. To remember. So I followed. I let it... wrap me up. I thought it was keeping me safe. Keeping the memories safe.""

He looked down at my son's hands, flexing them as if they were new and strange. ""But it doesn't just take the memories. It feeds on them. Sips them, like water. And when they're gone... it takes the rest. Slowly. It digests you. Soul first, then the body.""

The horror of it was absolute. 

""When the boy... when he cut it open..."" The voice faltered, and for a second my son's face contorted in pain. ""It was like a broken line. A connection. What was left of me... it was just... floating. And the boy was right there. Open. Curious. An empty vessel. So I... I fell in.""

""My God,"" I breathed. ""Is he... is my son gone?""

""No,"" the voice said, and there was a desperate urgency in it now. ""He's here. I'm just... laid over him. A thin sheet. But the thing... it knows. It knows the meal was interrupted. It knows a part of its food escaped. And it knows there's a fresh one, right here."" He gestured to his own chest, to my son's chest. ""You have to get him out. Now. Before it settles. Before it decides to take him instead.""

""What about you?"" I sobbed. ""Dad, I can't just leave you.""

The face that was not my son's gave me a sad, grim smile. It was the first time I'd ever seen my father smile. ""I've been gone for twenty years, son. I'm just an echo.  Now go. Run. And don't look back. It's watching us.""

As if on cue, a dead branch fell from a tree high above, crashing to the forest floor just a few feet away with a sound like a gunshot. It wasn't the wind. The air was dead still.

That was it. The spell of horrified paralysis was broken. I grabbed my son's arm. He was limp, his eyes half-closed.

""Come on,"" I yelled, pulling him. ""We have to go!""

We ran. We crashed through the undergrowth, branches whipping at our faces. I half-dragged him, his feet stumbling over roots. He was in a daze, a passenger in his own body. The woods, which had felt so peaceful just a day before, now felt alive and malignant. Every tree seemed to lean in, their branches like grasping claws. I felt a pressure in the air, a drop in temperature. It was a feeling of immense, ancient attention. The feeling of a predator whose territory had been invaded and whose prey had been stolen.

I didn't dare look back. I just ran, my lungs burning, my only thought to get my son to the car, to safety.

""Dad?"" my son's real voice, small and scared. ""What's happening? My head hurts.""

""Just keep running!"" I screamed.

A moment later, the other voice, the raspy whisper. ""Faster. It's close. I can feel it pulling.""

He was switching back and forth. A terrible, psychic tug-of-war was happening inside my child's head. One moment, he was my terrified sixteen-year-old. The next, he was the fading ghost of my father, urging us on.

""The edge of the woods,"" the ghost-voice gasped. ""It doesn't like the open spaces. The iron. The roads.""

We could see it, then. A break in the trees. The faint glint of sunlight on a car's windshield. The gravel of the parking area. It was maybe two hundred yards away. It felt like a thousand miles.

The feeling of being watched intensified. It was a physical weight now, pressing on my back, trying to slow me down. I heard a sound behind us, a soft, wet, dragging sound. I didn't look. I couldn't. I just pulled my son harder.

""I can't... hold on much longer,"" my father's voice whispered, weak and thin. ""It's pulling me back... wants to finish...""

""Fight it, Dad!"" I screamed, not knowing who I was talking to anymore.

""Tell your mother... I'm sorry I..."" The voice dissolved into a choked gasp.

My son's body went rigid. He cried out, a sharp, terrified sound. ""Dad! It's in my head! I can feel it!""

We were fifty feet from the treeline. Thirty. Twenty.

With one final, desperate surge, I threw us forward, out of the shade of the trees and into the bright, clear sunlight of the parking lot. We tumbled onto the gravel, scraping our hands and knees.

The moment we crossed the line, it was like a switch was flipped. The immense pressure on my back vanished. The air grew warm again. The menacing silence of the woods was replaced by the distant sound of a car on the highway.

My son lay on the ground, gasping. He pushed himself up, his eyes wide with confusion. They were his eyes again. Just his. Young, scared, and completely his own.

""Dad? What... what the hell?"" he asked, his voice trembling. ""Why were we running? I... I was at the campfire. You were telling me about grandpa. And now... we're here. My head is killing me.""

He didn't remember. He didn't remember the morning. The walk. The conversation. He didn't remember his own grandfather speaking through his lips. It was all gone. 

I couldn't bring myself to tell him. Not then. Maybe not ever. How could I explain it?

I just pulled him to his feet, hugged him tighter than I ever have in my life, and got him in the car. We drove away and didn't look back.

We’ve been home for four days. He seems normal. Back to his phone, his headphones, his grunts. But sometimes, I catch him staring off into space. And once, just once, I saw him standing at the window, looking out at the trees in our backyard. He was rubbing the back of his neck with his left hand. And his face, for just a second, was a mask of grim, weary silence.

I know my father saved us. His echo, his ghost, whatever it was, it warned us. But I also know that when you disturb something ancient and hungry, it doesn't just forget. Part of my father got out. I think a tiny, little piece of whatever was hunting him might have followed.

I don’t know what was in that cocoon. I don’t know what it is that lives in those woods. But I know it feeds on people, and it’s patient. And I know it’s still there, waiting. Someone else will wander off the trail. Someone else will get lost. Someone else will be drawn in by the promise of forgotten memories.",12,1766866480.0,nosleep,0,0.88,False

I think someone else connected with him instead.","It started with good intentions. That’s the sick joke of it all.

My son is sixteen. And if you have a sixteen-year-old, you know what I mean when I say he’s a stranger living in my house. He exists in a self-contained universe of glowing screens, muffled bass from his headphones, and monosyllabic grunts that pass for communication. We used to be close. When he was little, he was my shadow. Now, I’m just the guy who pays for the Wi-Fi.

The distance between us had become a canyon, and I was terrified that one day I’d look across and not be able to see the other side at all. I had to do something. So I fell back on the only thing I knew, the only real template for fatherhood I ever had.

My own father was a grim man. Not cruel, not abusive, just… silent. He was a block of granite, weathered and hard, and you could spend a lifetime chipping away and never find the core of him. He worked a hard-labor job, came home, ate his dinner while staring at the wall, and spent his weekends either fixing things in the garage or just sitting on the porch. The only time he ever seemed to unthaw, the only time I felt anything like a connection, was when he took me hunting.

He’d take me to a vast, sprawling state forest a few hours from our house. We’d walk for miles, not really hunting anything specific, just walking. He’d point out tracks, identify bird calls, show me which mushrooms would kill you and which you could eat. He spoke more in those woods in a single weekend than he would in a month at home. It was our place. His church.

He’s gone now. Been gone twenty years. I’ll get to that.

So, I decided to take my son to the same woods. I pitched it as a ""digital detox"" camping and hunting trip. He complained, of course. A weekend without signal was, to him, a fate worse than death. But I bribed him with a new, expensive hunting knife he’d been wanting, and with a weary sigh, he agreed.

The first day was… okay. Awkward. The silence in the car was heavy. When we got there and started hiking in, he kept pulling out his phone, trying to find a bar of service, his face a mask of frustration. I just kept walking, trying to channel my old man’s patience.

""Look,"" I said, pointing. ""Deer tracks. A doe and a fawn, see how small the second set is?""

He glanced, gave a noncommittal ""huh,"" and went back to his phone.

My heart sank. This was a mistake. I was trying to force a memory that wasn’t his, trying to fit him into a mold my own father had made for me.

But then, a few hours in, something shifted. The deeper we got, the more the silence of the woods seemed to swallow the silence between us. His phone was useless, a dead brick in his pocket. He finally put it away. He started to look around. He asked me what kind of tree a particularly massive, gnarled oak was. He asked if there were bears out here. We talked. Actually talked. About school, about some girl he liked, about the stupid video games he played. It was stilted and clumsy, but it was a conversation, a start even. A fragile bridge across the canyon.

By late afternoon, we were miles from any marked trail. This was how my father did it. He believed the real woods didn't start until you couldn't hear the highway anymore. The air grew cooler, thick with the smell of damp earth and decaying leaves. The sunlight, filtered through the dense canopy, painted the forest floor in shifting patterns of green and gold. It was beautiful. Peaceful. I felt the tension in my shoulders, a knot I hadn't realized I’d been carrying for years, finally begin to loosen. My son seemed to feel it too. He was walking with a lighter step, his head up, taking it all in.

""It's... pretty quiet out here,"" he said as an observation.

""It is,"" I replied, smiling. ""It's the kind of quiet that's full of sound, if you listen.""

We were walking through a part of the forest I’d never been to, even with my father. The trees were older here, thicker. Their branches were heavy with moss that hung down like old men’s beards. The ground was a spongy carpet of fallen needles. It felt ancient, untouched.

That’s when he saw it.

""Dad, what the hell is that?""

He was pointing off to our left, maybe fifty yards into a thicket of ferns. I followed his gaze, and my breath caught in my throat.

Hanging from the thick, low-slung branch of a colossal pine was… a thing. It’s hard to describe. At first glance, it looked like a massive, oversized cocoon or hornet’s nest. It was roughly human-sized, maybe a little over six feet long, and hung vertically. But it wasn't made of paper or silk. It seemed to be woven from the forest itself. Moss, pine needles, strips of bark, and thick, fibrous vines were all matted together with some kind of dark, hardened secretion that looked like dried sap. It was a grotesque parody of a chrysalis, a lumpy, organic pod that was a deep, sickly green-brown, perfectly camouflaged against the tree trunk behind it. It just… felt wrong. Deeply, fundamentally wrong. 

A primal alarm bell went off in the deepest part of my brain. The kind of instinct that kept our ancestors alive when they heard a rustle in the tall grass.

""Don't,"" I said, my voice low and urgent. ""Stay here.""

But he's sixteen. ""Don't"" is an invitation. He was already pushing through the ferns, his earlier apathy replaced by a morbid, fearless curiosity.

""No, seriously,"" I snapped, harsher this time. ""Get back here. Now.""

""Just want to see what it is,"" he called back, not even looking at me. ""It's weird.""

I hurried after him, my heart hammering against my ribs. ""We don't know what it is. It could be a nest for something dangerous. Back away from it.""

He was standing right in front of it now, looking up. From up close, it was even worse. You could see the intricate weaving of the fibers, the way small twigs and dead leaves were incorporated into its structure. It swayed ever so slightly in the breeze, a silent, monstrous pendulum. There was a faint, cloying smell coming from it, like rotting mushrooms and wet soil.

""I'm just gonna poke it,"" he said, reaching for a stick.

""You will not,"" I said, grabbing his arm. My voice was trembling. I couldn't explain my fear. It was an absolute, unreasoning terror. ""We're leaving. We're turning around and we're leaving right now.""

He pulled his arm away, a flash of defiance in his eyes. The connection we had started to build was crumbling, replaced by the old wall of teenage rebellion. ""Why? You're being weird. It's probably just some weird fungus or something.""

""It's not fungus,"" I said. ""We're going.""

He ignored me. Before I could stop him, he’d pulled out the new hunting knife I’d given him. The polished steel glinted in the dim light.

""What are you doing?"" I hissed.

""I want to see what's inside,"" he said, his voice steady. He was completely focused on the cocoon, his face a mask of intense concentration.

I should have tackled him. I should have dragged him away. But I was frozen, paralyzed by that deep, animal fear and a sudden, sickening premonition. I watched, helpless, as he reached up and pressed the tip of the knife into the lower part of the pod.

It wasn't tough. The blade sank in with a wet, tearing sound, like cutting through damp cardboard. He pulled the knife down, creating a long, vertical slit. The smell intensified, a wave of damp decay washing over us.

He worked the knife, widening the opening. Something dark and brittle shifted inside. He put his knife away and, with a grimace, used both hands to pull the two sides of the slit apart.

The contents spilled out onto the forest floor with a dry, hollow rattle.

It was a human skeleton.

The bones were clean, bleached to a pale yellowish-white, but stained in places with dark green and brown patches, as if the very substance of the cocoon had seeped into them. They were tangled with the same fibrous, vine-like material from the pod's exterior, which seemed to have grown through the ribcage and around the long bones of the arms and legs. A few scraps of what might have been clothing—denim, maybe flannel—were fused into the matted material, almost indistinguishable from the bark and leaves. The skull rolled a few inches away and came to rest facing up, its empty eye sockets staring at the canopy above.

We both stood there, utterly silent, the sound of our own breathing loud in the still air. The quiet of the woods was menacing. The bridge between us had reappeared, but this time it was built of shared horror. My son looked pale, his bravado completely gone, replaced by a sick, green tinge. He stumbled back, his hand over his mouth.

It took us a few minutes to get our wits back. I fumbled for my phone, which was useless. We had to hike back. We marked the spot as best we could and then we walked, fast. We didn't talk. The only sounds were our footsteps, frantic and loud on the forest floor. The woods felt different now. Every shadow seemed to stretch, every rustle of leaves sounded like something following us. I felt a thousand unseen eyes on my back.

We made it to a ridge with a single bar of service and called 911. They routed us to the park rangers. I explained what we found, my voice shaking. They took our location and told us to wait by the main trail.

Two rangers met us an hour later. They were calm, professional. They took our statements. We led them back to the site. They looked at the skeleton, at the bizarre cocoon hanging in tatters from the branch. One of them poked at it with a stick.

""Never seen anything like this,"" he said to his partner, his face impassive. ""The nest, I mean.""

""Some kind of insect?"" the other asked.

""Not one I know. We'll have the forensics team come out. Probably some missing hiker from years back. Sad business.""

They told us we were free to go, that they'd contact us if they needed more information. And that was it. They were treating it like a tragic but ultimately explainable event. A hiker gets lost, dies of exposure, and some strange, undiscovered insect or fungus makes a nest out of the remains. It sounded almost plausible, if you didn't look too closely at the thing, if you hadn't felt that unnatural dread in its presence.

We hiked back to our planned campsite, neither of us wanting to abandon the trip entirely. It felt like admitting defeat, like letting the horror win. But the mood was ruined. The easy connection we’d found was gone, replaced by a shared, unspoken trauma.

We set up the tent and built a fire. The flames pushed back the encroaching darkness, but it felt like a flimsy defense. The woods pressed in, black and silent, just beyond the ring of light.

My son sat on a log, poking the fire with a stick. He was quiet again, but it was a different kind of quiet. Not the sullen, withdrawn silence of a teenager, but something deeper, more thoughtful. More… somber.

""Dad?"" he said, his voice soft. ""You never really told me how grandpa died.""

The question hit me like a physical blow. The timing of it, here, in this place, after what we’d just seen. My blood ran cold.

I took a deep breath. ""He, uh… he got sick.""

""Sick how?""

""His mind,"" I said, struggling for the words. ""He got Alzheimer's. Early onset. He was only in his late fifties. It was… fast. One day he was just my quiet, grim old man. A few years later, he was… gone. Even when he was sitting right in front of me.""

The fire crackled, spitting embers into the night sky.

""He was always a loner,"" I continued, the memories flooding back, sharp and painful. ""But the sickness made it worse. He'd get confused, agitated. He'd wander. One day, he just… walked out of the house. Mom was in the garden for maybe twenty minutes. When she came back in, he was gone.""

My son looked at me, his eyes reflecting the firelight. He was completely still.

""They searched for him. Police, volunteers, everyone. They had dogs. They found his tracks leading from the house to the edge of the woods. These woods."" I gestured out into the blackness around us. ""His trail went in, and it just… stopped. They never found anything. Not a shoe, not a piece of clothing. Nothing. He just vanished in here.""

We sat in silence for a long time after that. The weight of my story, combined with the skeleton in the woods, settled over our campsite like a shroud. I watched my son. He was staring into the flames, his expression unreadable. But something about his posture, the way he held his shoulders, the set of his jaw… it sent a chill down my spine. It was eerily familiar.

It was the way my father used to sit.

I tried to shake it off. He’s in shock. We both are. He’s just processing what I told him. It’s a coincidence.

But the feeling wouldn't go away.

Later, as we were getting ready to turn in, the strangeness started. I was shivering, a bit of a chill in the air. I opened my mouth to ask him if he wanted another blanket from the car, the thought just forming in my head.

Before a single word came out, he said, without looking up from unlacing his boots, ""I'm not cold.""

I froze. ""What?""

""I'm fine,"" he said, his voice flat. He didn't seem to notice anything odd about it.

I dismissed it. A lucky guess. We’re father and son, maybe we were just on the same wavelength. But it happened again a few minutes later. I was thinking about the long hike back in the morning, wondering if we should pack up camp tonight and just sleep in the car. It was a fleeting, internal debate.

""We should stay,"" he said, his voice quiet but firm, as if responding to a spoken question. ""It's better to get an early start when it's light out.""

This time, a genuine spike of fear shot through me. I stared at him. He was laying out his sleeping bag in the tent, his movements economical and precise. There was a lack of wasted motion about him that was profoundly unfamiliar. My son was a creature of sprawling limbs and clumsy energy. This was… different. Contained and controlled.

""How did you know I was thinking that?"" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.

He finally looked at me. His eyes seemed… older. The playful spark, the teenage angst, it was all gone. Replaced by a flat, weary emptiness. ""Just figured,"" he said, and turned away.

I didn't sleep that night. I lay in my sleeping bag, my body rigid, listening to the sound of his slow, even breathing from the other side of the small tent. Every nocturnal snap of a twig, every hoot of a distant owl, sounded like a threat. I kept replaying the events of the day in my head. The cocoon. The skeleton. My father’s disappearance. My son’s changing demeanor. The pieces were all there, scattered on the floor of my mind, and they were beginning to form a picture I did not want to see.

The next morning, it was worse.

He was up before me, which never happens. He had already packed his sleeping bag and was sitting by the dead fire, nursing a cup of instant coffee. He didn't greet me. He just nodded, a short, clipped gesture. It was my father’s nod. I’d received that same nod a thousand times as a boy.

We packed up the rest of the camp in near silence. The change was undeniable now. He didn’t slouch. He didn’t drag his feet. He worked efficiently, his face a hard mask. He looked at the woods around us with a kind of quiet, grim familiarity.

""We should head north-east,"" he said, pointing through the trees. ""It's a more direct route to the trail. Shave an hour off the walk.""

He was right. But I had been the one poring over the map the night before. He’d barely glanced at it. How could he know that?

""How do you know that?"" I asked, my voice tight.

He squinted, looking up at the position of the sun. ""Just a feeling. This way's better.""

And then he did it. He rubbed the back of his neck with his left hand, a specific, peculiar gesture my father always made when he was thinking or feeling uneasy. A habit I hadn't seen in twenty years.

I felt like the ground had dropped out from under me. This wasn't shock. This wasn't my son processing trauma. Something was fundamentally, terrifyingly wrong.

We started walking. He took the lead. He moved through the undergrowth with a confidence that made no sense. He wasn't the city kid who’d been complaining about bugs yesterday. He moved like he belonged here. Like he’d walked these paths his entire life.

My mind was racing, trying to find a rational explanation. A psychotic break? Shared delusion? But the cold, hard reality of his mannerisms, of his impossible knowledge, defied any easy answer.

I had to know. I had to test it.

""Did you... did you sleep okay?"" I asked, my voice barely a whisper.

He didn't turn around. ""Fine. Dreamt of the war.""

I stopped dead. My blood turned to ice water.

""What?""

He stopped and turned to face me. The look on his face was not my son's. It was a tired, haunted look I knew all too well. It was the look in my father's eyes in his last few years, when the fog of his disease was thick.

""The war,"" he repeated, his voice raspy, unfamiliar. ""The heat. The noise.""

My father had served in Vietnam. He never, ever spoke of it. Not once. But my mother told me he had terrible nightmares his whole life. My son knew none of this. I'd never told him.

This was it. The precipice. I was either losing my mind, or I was speaking to something that was not my child. I took a shaky breath, my heart feeling like it was going to beat its way out of my chest. I decided to take the leap. I decided to speak to the ghost.

""Dad?"" I said, the word feeling alien and terrifying in my mouth.

The face that was my son's twisted. For a second, it was him again, a flash of pure confusion and fear in his eyes. ""Dad, what's...?"" And then it was gone, submerged. The grim, empty mask was back. The eyes focused on me, but they were looking from a great distance.

""You shouldn't have brought the boy here,"" the voice said. It was my son's voice, but the cadence was all wrong. It was slow, gravelly. It was my father's.

Tears streamed down my face. A horrifying mix of grief and terror. ""What happened to you? What is this place?""

He—it—looked around at the ancient trees, a flicker of profound fear in those old eyes. ""It's hungry,"" he whispered. ""It's always hungry.""

""What is?"" I begged. ""The thing in the tree? What did it do to you?""

""It doesn't move fast,"" the voice rasped, ignoring my question. ""It's patient. It gets in your head. I was... lost. Confused. The sickness... it made it easy for it. It finds the ones that are already fading and promises... clarity. A way back.""

A memory surfaced, sharp and terrible. One of my last clear conversations with my father before the Alzheimer's took him completely. He’d been staring out the window, looking towards the hills where these woods lay. ""I just need to get back there,"" he'd mumbled. ""It's clearer there. I can think there."" We'd thought he was just confused, longing for his youth.

""It led me,"" the voice continued, a tremor running through my son's body. ""Deep in. Talked to me.  In... thoughts. Showed me things. Things I'd forgotten. My own father's face. The day you were born.""

The voice hitched. ""It felt good. To remember. So I followed. I let it... wrap me up. I thought it was keeping me safe. Keeping the memories safe.""

He looked down at my son's hands, flexing them as if they were new and strange. ""But it doesn't just take the memories. It feeds on them. Sips them, like water. And when they're gone... it takes the rest. Slowly. It digests you. Soul first, then the body.""

The horror of it was absolute. 

""When the boy... when he cut it open..."" The voice faltered, and for a second my son's face contorted in pain. ""It was like a broken line. A connection. What was left of me... it was just... floating. And the boy was right there. Open. Curious. An empty vessel. So I... I fell in.""

""My God,"" I breathed. ""Is he... is my son gone?""

""No,"" the voice said, and there was a desperate urgency in it now. ""He's here. I'm just... laid over him. A thin sheet. But the thing... it knows. It knows the meal was interrupted. It knows a part of its food escaped. And it knows there's a fresh one, right here."" He gestured to his own chest, to my son's chest. ""You have to get him out. Now. Before it settles. Before it decides to take him instead.""

""What about you?"" I sobbed. ""Dad, I can't just leave you.""

The face that was not my son's gave me a sad, grim smile. It was the first time I'd ever seen my father smile. ""I've been gone for twenty years, son. I'm just an echo.  Now go. Run. And don't look back. It's watching us.""

As if on cue, a dead branch fell from a tree high above, crashing to the forest floor just a few feet away with a sound like a gunshot. It wasn't the wind. The air was dead still.

That was it. The spell of horrified paralysis was broken. I grabbed my son's arm. He was limp, his eyes half-closed.

""Come on,"" I yelled, pulling him. ""We have to go!""

We ran. We crashed through the undergrowth, branches whipping at our faces. I half-dragged him, his feet stumbling over roots. He was in a daze, a passenger in his own body. The woods, which had felt so peaceful just a day before, now felt alive and malignant. Every tree seemed to lean in, their branches like grasping claws. I felt a pressure in the air, a drop in temperature. It was a feeling of immense, ancient attention. The feeling of a predator whose territory had been invaded and whose prey had been stolen.

I didn't dare look back. I just ran, my lungs burning, my only thought to get my son to the car, to safety.

""Dad?"" my son's real voice, small and scared. ""What's happening? My head hurts.""

""Just keep running!"" I screamed.

A moment later, the other voice, the raspy whisper. ""Faster. It's close. I can feel it pulling.""

He was switching back and forth. A terrible, psychic tug-of-war was happening inside my child's head. One moment, he was my terrified sixteen-year-old. The next, he was the fading ghost of my father, urging us on.

""The edge of the woods,"" the ghost-voice gasped. ""It doesn't like the open spaces. The iron. The roads.""

We could see it, then. A break in the trees. The faint glint of sunlight on a car's windshield. The gravel of the parking area. It was maybe two hundred yards away. It felt like a thousand miles.

The feeling of being watched intensified. It was a physical weight now, pressing on my back, trying to slow me down. I heard a sound behind us, a soft, wet, dragging sound. I didn't look. I couldn't. I just pulled my son harder.

""I can't... hold on much longer,"" my father's voice whispered, weak and thin. ""It's pulling me back... wants to finish...""

""Fight it, Dad!"" I screamed, not knowing who I was talking to anymore.

""Tell your mother... I'm sorry I..."" The voice dissolved into a choked gasp.

My son's body went rigid. He cried out, a sharp, terrified sound. ""Dad! It's in my head! I can feel it!""

We were fifty feet from the treeline. Thirty. Twenty.

With one final, desperate surge, I threw us forward, out of the shade of the trees and into the bright, clear sunlight of the parking lot. We tumbled onto the gravel, scraping our hands and knees.

The moment we crossed the line, it was like a switch was flipped. The immense pressure on my back vanished. The air grew warm again. The menacing silence of the woods was replaced by the distant sound of a car on the highway.

My son lay on the ground, gasping. He pushed himself up, his eyes wide with confusion. They were his eyes again. Just his. Young, scared, and completely his own.

""Dad? What... what the hell?"" he asked, his voice trembling. ""Why were we running? I... I was at the campfire. You were telling me about grandpa. And now... we're here. My head is killing me.""

He didn't remember. He didn't remember the morning. The walk. The conversation. He didn't remember his own grandfather speaking through his lips. It was all gone. 

I couldn't bring myself to tell him. Not then. Maybe not ever. How could I explain it?

I just pulled him to his feet, hugged him tighter than I ever have in my life, and got him in the car. We drove away and didn't look back.

We’ve been home for four days. He seems normal. Back to his phone, his headphones, his grunts. But sometimes, I catch him staring off into space. And once, just once, I saw him standing at the window, looking out at the trees in our backyard. He was rubbing the back of his neck with his left hand. And his face, for just a second, was a mask of grim, weary silence.

I know my father saved us. His echo, his ghost, whatever it was, it warned us. But I also know that when you disturb something ancient and hungry, it doesn't just forget. Part of my father got out. I think a tiny, little piece of whatever was hunting him might have followed.

I don’t know what was in that cocoon. I don’t know what it is that lives in those woods. But I know it feeds on people, and it’s patient. And I know it’s still there, waiting. Someone else will wander off the trail. Someone else will get lost. Someone else will be drawn in by the promise of forgotten memories.",3,1766866467.0,stories,3,0.81,False

I think someone else connected with him instead.","It started with good intentions. That’s the sick joke of it all.

My son is sixteen. And if you have a sixteen-year-old, you know what I mean when I say he’s a stranger living in my house. He exists in a self-contained universe of glowing screens, muffled bass from his headphones, and monosyllabic grunts that pass for communication. We used to be close. When he was little, he was my shadow. Now, I’m just the guy who pays for the Wi-Fi.

The distance between us had become a canyon, and I was terrified that one day I’d look across and not be able to see the other side at all. I had to do something. So I fell back on the only thing I knew, the only real template for fatherhood I ever had.

My own father was a grim man. Not cruel, not abusive, just… silent. He was a block of granite, weathered and hard, and you could spend a lifetime chipping away and never find the core of him. He worked a hard-labor job, came home, ate his dinner while staring at the wall, and spent his weekends either fixing things in the garage or just sitting on the porch. The only time he ever seemed to unthaw, the only time I felt anything like a connection, was when he took me hunting.

He’d take me to a vast, sprawling state forest a few hours from our house. We’d walk for miles, not really hunting anything specific, just walking. He’d point out tracks, identify bird calls, show me which mushrooms would kill you and which you could eat. He spoke more in those woods in a single weekend than he would in a month at home. It was our place. His church.

He’s gone now. Been gone twenty years. I’ll get to that.

So, I decided to take my son to the same woods. I pitched it as a ""digital detox"" camping and hunting trip. He complained, of course. A weekend without signal was, to him, a fate worse than death. But I bribed him with a new, expensive hunting knife he’d been wanting, and with a weary sigh, he agreed.

The first day was… okay. Awkward. The silence in the car was heavy. When we got there and started hiking in, he kept pulling out his phone, trying to find a bar of service, his face a mask of frustration. I just kept walking, trying to channel my old man’s patience.

""Look,"" I said, pointing. ""Deer tracks. A doe and a fawn, see how small the second set is?""

He glanced, gave a noncommittal ""huh,"" and went back to his phone.

My heart sank. This was a mistake. I was trying to force a memory that wasn’t his, trying to fit him into a mold my own father had made for me.

But then, a few hours in, something shifted. The deeper we got, the more the silence of the woods seemed to swallow the silence between us. His phone was useless, a dead brick in his pocket. He finally put it away. He started to look around. He asked me what kind of tree a particularly massive, gnarled oak was. He asked if there were bears out here. We talked. Actually talked. About school, about some girl he liked, about the stupid video games he played. It was stilted and clumsy, but it was a conversation, a start even. A fragile bridge across the canyon.

By late afternoon, we were miles from any marked trail. This was how my father did it. He believed the real woods didn't start until you couldn't hear the highway anymore. The air grew cooler, thick with the smell of damp earth and decaying leaves. The sunlight, filtered through the dense canopy, painted the forest floor in shifting patterns of green and gold. It was beautiful. Peaceful. I felt the tension in my shoulders, a knot I hadn't realized I’d been carrying for years, finally begin to loosen. My son seemed to feel it too. He was walking with a lighter step, his head up, taking it all in.

""It's... pretty quiet out here,"" he said as an observation.

""It is,"" I replied, smiling. ""It's the kind of quiet that's full of sound, if you listen.""

We were walking through a part of the forest I’d never been to, even with my father. The trees were older here, thicker. Their branches were heavy with moss that hung down like old men’s beards. The ground was a spongy carpet of fallen needles. It felt ancient, untouched.

That’s when he saw it.

""Dad, what the hell is that?""

He was pointing off to our left, maybe fifty yards into a thicket of ferns. I followed his gaze, and my breath caught in my throat.

Hanging from the thick, low-slung branch of a colossal pine was… a thing. It’s hard to describe. At first glance, it looked like a massive, oversized cocoon or hornet’s nest. It was roughly human-sized, maybe a little over six feet long, and hung vertically. But it wasn't made of paper or silk. It seemed to be woven from the forest itself. Moss, pine needles, strips of bark, and thick, fibrous vines were all matted together with some kind of dark, hardened secretion that looked like dried sap. It was a grotesque parody of a chrysalis, a lumpy, organic pod that was a deep, sickly green-brown, perfectly camouflaged against the tree trunk behind it. It just… felt wrong. Deeply, fundamentally wrong. 

A primal alarm bell went off in the deepest part of my brain. The kind of instinct that kept our ancestors alive when they heard a rustle in the tall grass.

""Don't,"" I said, my voice low and urgent. ""Stay here.""

But he's sixteen. ""Don't"" is an invitation. He was already pushing through the ferns, his earlier apathy replaced by a morbid, fearless curiosity.

""No, seriously,"" I snapped, harsher this time. ""Get back here. Now.""

""Just want to see what it is,"" he called back, not even looking at me. ""It's weird.""

I hurried after him, my heart hammering against my ribs. ""We don't know what it is. It could be a nest for something dangerous. Back away from it.""

He was standing right in front of it now, looking up. From up close, it was even worse. You could see the intricate weaving of the fibers, the way small twigs and dead leaves were incorporated into its structure. It swayed ever so slightly in the breeze, a silent, monstrous pendulum. There was a faint, cloying smell coming from it, like rotting mushrooms and wet soil.

""I'm just gonna poke it,"" he said, reaching for a stick.

""You will not,"" I said, grabbing his arm. My voice was trembling. I couldn't explain my fear. It was an absolute, unreasoning terror. ""We're leaving. We're turning around and we're leaving right now.""

He pulled his arm away, a flash of defiance in his eyes. The connection we had started to build was crumbling, replaced by the old wall of teenage rebellion. ""Why? You're being weird. It's probably just some weird fungus or something.""

""It's not fungus,"" I said. ""We're going.""

He ignored me. Before I could stop him, he’d pulled out the new hunting knife I’d given him. The polished steel glinted in the dim light.

""What are you doing?"" I hissed.

""I want to see what's inside,"" he said, his voice steady. He was completely focused on the cocoon, his face a mask of intense concentration.

I should have tackled him. I should have dragged him away. But I was frozen, paralyzed by that deep, animal fear and a sudden, sickening premonition. I watched, helpless, as he reached up and pressed the tip of the knife into the lower part of the pod.

It wasn't tough. The blade sank in with a wet, tearing sound, like cutting through damp cardboard. He pulled the knife down, creating a long, vertical slit. The smell intensified, a wave of damp decay washing over us.

He worked the knife, widening the opening. Something dark and brittle shifted inside. He put his knife away and, with a grimace, used both hands to pull the two sides of the slit apart.

The contents spilled out onto the forest floor with a dry, hollow rattle.

It was a human skeleton.

The bones were clean, bleached to a pale yellowish-white, but stained in places with dark green and brown patches, as if the very substance of the cocoon had seeped into them. They were tangled with the same fibrous, vine-like material from the pod's exterior, which seemed to have grown through the ribcage and around the long bones of the arms and legs. A few scraps of what might have been clothing—denim, maybe flannel—were fused into the matted material, almost indistinguishable from the bark and leaves. The skull rolled a few inches away and came to rest facing up, its empty eye sockets staring at the canopy above.

We both stood there, utterly silent, the sound of our own breathing loud in the still air. The quiet of the woods was menacing. The bridge between us had reappeared, but this time it was built of shared horror. My son looked pale, his bravado completely gone, replaced by a sick, green tinge. He stumbled back, his hand over his mouth.

It took us a few minutes to get our wits back. I fumbled for my phone, which was useless. We had to hike back. We marked the spot as best we could and then we walked, fast. We didn't talk. The only sounds were our footsteps, frantic and loud on the forest floor. The woods felt different now. Every shadow seemed to stretch, every rustle of leaves sounded like something following us. I felt a thousand unseen eyes on my back.

Two rangers met us an hour later. They were calm, professional. They took our statements. We led them back to the site. They looked at the skeleton, at the bizarre cocoon hanging in tatters from the branch. One of them poked at it with a stick.

""Never seen anything like this,"" he said to his partner, his face impassive. ""The nest, I mean.""

""Some kind of insect?"" the other asked.

""Not one I know. We'll have the forensics team come out. Probably some missing hiker from years back. Sad business.""

It sounded almost plausible, if you didn't look too closely at the thing, if you hadn't felt that unnatural dread in its presence.

We hiked back to our planned campsite, neither of us wanting to abandon the trip entirely. It felt like admitting defeat, like letting the horror win. But the mood was ruined. The easy connection we’d found was gone, replaced by a shared, unspoken trauma.

We set up the tent and built a fire. The flames pushed back the encroaching darkness, but it felt like a flimsy defense. The woods pressed in, black and silent, just beyond the ring of light.

My son sat on a log, poking the fire with a stick. He was quiet again, but it was a different kind of quiet. Not the sullen, withdrawn silence of a teenager, but something deeper, more thoughtful. More… somber.

""Dad?"" he said, his voice soft. ""You never really told me how grandpa died.""

The question hit me like a physical blow. The timing of it, here, in this place, after what we’d just seen. My blood ran cold.

I took a deep breath. ""He, uh… he got sick.""

""Sick how?""

""His mind,"" I said, struggling for the words. ""He got Alzheimer's. Early onset. He was only in his late fifties. It was… fast. One day he was just my quiet, grim old man. A few years later, he was… gone. Even when he was sitting right in front of me.""

The fire crackled, spitting embers into the night sky.

""He was always a loner,"" I continued, the memories flooding back, sharp and painful. ""But the sickness made it worse. He'd get confused, agitated. He'd wander. One day, he just… walked out of the house. Mom was in the garden for maybe twenty minutes. When she came back in, he was gone.""

My son looked at me, his eyes reflecting the firelight. He was completely still.

""They searched for him. Police, volunteers, everyone. They had dogs. They found his tracks leading from the house to the edge of the woods. These woods."" I gestured out into the blackness around us. ""His trail went in, and it just… stopped. They never found anything. Not a shoe, not a piece of clothing. Nothing. He just vanished in here.""

We sat in silence for a long time after that. The weight of my story, combined with the skeleton in the woods, settled over our campsite like a shroud. I watched my son. He was staring into the flames, his expression unreadable. But something about his posture, the way he held his shoulders, the set of his jaw… it sent a chill down my spine. It was eerily familiar.

I froze. ""What?""

I was thinking about the long hike back in the morning, wondering if we should pack up camp tonight and just sleep in the car. It was a fleeting, internal debate.

""We should stay,"" he said, his voice quiet but firm, as if responding to a spoken question. ""It's better to get an early start when it's light out.""

This time, a genuine spike of fear shot through me. I stared at him. He was laying out his sleeping bag in the tent, his movements economical and precise. There was a lack of wasted motion about him that was profoundly unfamiliar. My son was a creature of sprawling limbs and clumsy energy. This was… different. Contained and controlled.

""How did you know I was thinking that?"" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.

He finally looked at me. His eyes seemed… older. The playful spark, the teenage angst, it was all gone. Replaced by a flat, weary emptiness. ""Just figured,"" he said, and turned away.

I didn't sleep that night. I lay in my sleeping bag, my body rigid, listening to the sound of his slow, even breathing from the other side of the small tent. Every nocturnal snap of a twig, every hoot of a distant owl, sounded like a threat. I kept replaying the events of the day in my head. The cocoon. The skeleton. My father’s disappearance. My son’s changing demeanor. The pieces were all there, scattered on the floor of my mind, and they were beginning to form a picture I did not want to see.

The next morning, it was worse.

He was up before me, which never happens. He had already packed his sleeping bag and was sitting by the dead fire, nursing a cup of instant coffee. He didn't greet me. He just nodded, a short, clipped gesture. It was my father’s nod. I’d received that same nod a thousand times as a boy.

We packed up the rest of the camp in near silence. The change was undeniable now. He didn’t slouch. He didn’t drag his feet. He worked efficiently, his face a hard mask. He looked at the woods around us with a kind of quiet, grim familiarity.

""We should head north-east,"" he said, pointing through the trees. ""It's a more direct route to the trail. Shave an hour off the walk.""

He was right. But I had been the one poring over the map the night before. He’d barely glanced at it. How could he know that?

""How do you know that?"" I asked, my voice tight.

He squinted, looking up at the position of the sun. ""Just a feeling. This way's better.""

And then he did it. He rubbed the back of his neck with his left hand, a specific, peculiar gesture my father always made when he was thinking or feeling uneasy. A habit I hadn't seen in twenty years.

I felt like the ground had dropped out from under me. This wasn't shock. This wasn't my son processing trauma. Something was fundamentally, terrifyingly wrong.

We started walking. He took the lead. He moved through the undergrowth with a confidence that made no sense. He wasn't the city kid who’d been complaining about bugs yesterday. He moved like he belonged here. Like he’d walked these paths his entire life.

My mind was racing, trying to find a rational explanation. A psychotic break? Shared delusion? But the cold, hard reality of his mannerisms, of his impossible knowledge, defied any easy answer.

I had to know. I had to test it.

""Did you... did you sleep okay?"" I asked, my voice barely a whisper.

He didn't turn around. ""Fine. Dreamt of the war.""

I stopped dead. My blood turned to ice water.

""What?""

He stopped and turned to face me. The look on his face was not my son's. It was a tired, haunted look I knew all too well. It was the look in my father's eyes in his last few years, when the fog of his disease was thick.

""The war,"" he repeated, his voice raspy, unfamiliar. ""The heat. The noise.""

My father had served in Vietnam. He never, ever spoke of it. Not once. But my mother told me he had terrible nightmares his whole life. My son knew none of this. I'd never told him.

This was it. The precipice. I was either losing my mind, or I was speaking to something that was not my child. I took a shaky breath, my heart feeling like it was going to beat its way out of my chest. I decided to take the leap. I decided to speak to the ghost.

""Dad?"" I said, the word feeling alien and terrifying in my mouth.

The face that was my son's twisted. For a second, it was him again, a flash of pure confusion and fear in his eyes. ""Dad, what's...?"" And then it was gone, submerged. The grim, empty mask was back. The eyes focused on me, but they were looking from a great distance.

""You shouldn't have brought the boy here,"" the voice said. It was my son's voice, but the cadence was all wrong. It was slow, gravelly. It was my father's.

Tears streamed down my face. A horrifying mix of grief and terror. ""What happened to you? What is this place?""

He—it—looked around at the ancient trees, a flicker of profound fear in those old eyes. ""It's hungry,"" he whispered. ""It's always hungry.""

""What is?"" I begged. ""The thing in the tree? What did it do to you?""

""It doesn't move fast,"" the voice rasped, ignoring my question. ""It's patient. It gets in your head. I was... lost. Confused. The sickness... it made it easy for it. It finds the ones that are already fading and promises... clarity. A way back.""

A memory surfaced, sharp and terrible. One of my last clear conversations with my father before the Alzheimer's took him completely. He’d been staring out the window, looking towards the hills where these woods lay. ""I just need to get back there,"" he'd mumbled. ""It's clearer there. I can think there."" We'd thought he was just confused, longing for his youth.

""It led me,"" the voice continued, a tremor running through my son's body. ""Deep in. Talked to me.  In... thoughts. Showed me things. Things I'd forgotten. My own father's face. The day you were born.""

The voice hitched. ""It felt good. To remember. So I followed. I let it... wrap me up. I thought it was keeping me safe. Keeping the memories safe.""

He looked down at my son's hands, flexing them as if they were new and strange. ""But it doesn't just take the memories. It feeds on them. Sips them, like water. And when they're gone... it takes the rest. Slowly. It digests you. Soul first, then the body.""

The horror of it was absolute. 

""When the boy... when he cut it open..."" The voice faltered, and for a second my son's face contorted in pain. ""It was like a broken line. A connection. What was left of me... it was just... floating. And the boy was right there. Open. Curious. An empty vessel. So I... I fell in.""

""My God,"" I breathed. ""Is he... is my son gone?""

""No,"" the voice said, and there was a desperate urgency in it now. ""He's here. I'm just... laid over him. A thin sheet. But the thing... it knows. It knows the meal was interrupted. It knows a part of its food escaped. And it knows there's a fresh one, right here."" He gestured to his own chest, to my son's chest. ""You have to get him out. Now. Before it settles. Before it decides to take him instead.""

""What about you?"" I sobbed. ""Dad, I can't just leave you.""

The face that was not my son's gave me a sad, grim smile. It was the first time I'd ever seen my father smile. ""I've been gone for twenty years, son. I'm just an echo.  Now go. Run. And don't look back. It's watching us.""

As if on cue, a dead branch fell from a tree high above, crashing to the forest floor just a few feet away with a sound like a gunshot. It wasn't the wind. The air was dead still.

That was it. The spell of horrified paralysis was broken. I grabbed my son's arm. He was limp, his eyes half-closed.

""Come on,"" I yelled, pulling him. ""We have to go!""

We ran. We crashed through the undergrowth, branches whipping at our faces. I half-dragged him, his feet stumbling over roots. He was in a daze, a passenger in his own body. The woods, which had felt so peaceful just a day before, now felt alive and malignant. Every tree seemed to lean in, their branches like grasping claws. I felt a pressure in the air, a drop in temperature. It was a feeling of immense, ancient attention. The feeling of a predator whose territory had been invaded and whose prey had been stolen.

I didn't dare look back. I just ran, my lungs burning, my only thought to get my son to the car, to safety.

""Dad?"" my son's real voice, small and scared. ""What's happening? My head hurts.""

""Just keep running!"" I screamed.

A moment later, the other voice, the raspy whisper. ""Faster. It's close. I can feel it pulling.""

He was switching back and forth. A terrible, psychic tug-of-war was happening inside my child's head. One moment, he was my terrified sixteen-year-old. The next, he was the fading ghost of my father, urging us on.

""The edge of the woods,"" the ghost-voice gasped. ""It doesn't like the open spaces. The iron. The roads.""

We could see it, then. A break in the trees. The faint glint of sunlight on a car's windshield. The gravel of the parking area. It was maybe two hundred yards away. It felt like a thousand miles.

The feeling of being watched intensified. It was a physical weight now, pressing on my back, trying to slow me down. I heard a sound behind us, a soft, wet, dragging sound. I didn't look. I couldn't. I just pulled my son harder.

""I can't... hold on much longer,"" my father's voice whispered, weak and thin. ""It's pulling me back... wants to finish...""

""Fight it, Dad!"" I screamed, not knowing who I was talking to anymore.

""Tell your mother... I'm sorry I..."" The voice dissolved into a choked gasp.

My son's body went rigid. He cried out, a sharp, terrified sound. ""Dad! It's in my head! I can feel it!""

We were fifty feet from the treeline. Thirty. Twenty.

With one final, desperate surge, I threw us forward, out of the shade of the trees and into the bright, clear sunlight of the parking lot. We tumbled onto the gravel, scraping our hands and knees.

The moment we crossed the line, it was like a switch was flipped. The immense pressure on my back vanished. The air grew warm again. The menacing silence of the woods was replaced by the distant sound of a car on the highway.

My son lay on the ground, gasping. He pushed himself up, his eyes wide with confusion. They were his eyes again. Just his. Young, scared, and completely his own.

""Dad? What... what the hell?"" he asked, his voice trembling. ""Why were we running? I... I was at the campfire. You were telling me about grandpa. And now... we're here. My head is killing me.""

He didn't remember. He didn't remember the morning. The walk. The conversation. He didn't remember his own grandfather speaking through his lips. It was all gone. 

I couldn't bring myself to tell him. Not then. Maybe not ever. How could I explain it?

I just pulled him to his feet, hugged him tighter than I ever have in my life, and got him in the car. We drove away and didn't look back.

We’ve been home for four days. He seems normal. Back to his phone, his headphones, his grunts. But sometimes, I catch him staring off into space. And once, just once, I saw him standing at the window, looking out at the trees in our backyard. He was rubbing the back of his neck with his left hand. And his face, for just a second, was a mask of grim, weary silence.

I know my father saved us. His echo, his ghost, whatever it was, it warned us. But I also know that when you disturb something ancient and hungry, it doesn't just forget. Part of my father got out. I think a tiny, little piece of whatever was hunting him might have followed.

I don’t know what was in that cocoon. I don’t know what it is that lives in those woods. But I know it feeds on people, and it’s patient. And I know it’s still there, waiting. Someone else will wander off the trail. Someone else will get lost. Someone else will be drawn in by the promise of forgotten memories.",1,1766866444.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

The OP thought the minor agitation of flipping the inverted AP might have been a factor in the flavor which he really liked. 

I like the flow control filter because I feel like it gives me more control—like the inverted method without any of the risk. 

But what I really liked about the inverted method is that you can eliminate most of that air cushion that’s really hard to press through with the flow control filter cap. I have a bad shoulder right now and pressing is challenging because my pre-ground coffee is an espresso grind. (And I’m glad I don’t have to hand grind right now because of my shoulder, too). 

I’m going to try it, but any guesses on what the results may be?",0,1766866419.0,AeroPress,2,0.5,False
