There's good news and bad news.

I managed to do the presentation. Yay.

However, I still got a huge fight or flight response 1 minute before I had to talk. Like, I felt like I would not at all be able to talk, the anxiety in my body was enormous and my mind was racing to thoughts like ""If I just close Zoom, I can fake that the power went out"" and things like that.

Luckily as this happened, the previous presenter kept talking a bit more instead of handing it over to me, and I managed to do some breathing excersises and focus on silly things enough that when it became my turn, I could speak normally. This of course is nice and I'm happy that it's over ""for now"", but it still makes me dread the next time I have to talk, because now I feel like the Propranolol didn't really help at all, since I'm sure that if the previous presenter had just handed it over to me, without me having the 30-60 seconds to settle down, I would still have completely choked.

I would love to hear if this has happened to other people and how you tackled it?

For info, I took 10 mg. early in the day, then I took 20 mg. 4 hours before and 10 mg. 2 hours before the presentation. I also avoided coffee both the day before and on the day.",2,1732709912.0,PublicSpeaking,0,1.0,False
1h12ygq,https://www.reddit.com/r/expertskincaretips/comments/1h12ygq/top_winter_skincare_tips_for_glowing_skin/,Top Winter Skincare Tips for Glowing Skin,"Winter can take a toll on your skin, leaving it dry, flaky, and dull. Whether you live in the chilly mountains or experience mild Indian winters, maintaining a healthy glow requires the right skincare products and practices. In this guide, we’ll cover top winter skincare tips and highlight **the** [best skin care products in India](https://truedermasa.com/) tailored to protect and nourish your skin.

# 1. Understand Winter Skin Needs

Cold weather and low humidity can strip your skin of moisture, making it feel tight and dehydrated. To combat this, your skincare routine should focus on:

* **Hydration**: Use products that lock in moisture.
* **Nourishment**: Look for rich, creamy textures to protect against dryness.
* **Barrier Repair**: Support your skin's natural defenses to prevent irritation.

By choosing **India’s best skin care products**, you can ensure optimal results for glowing skin.

# 2. Cleansing: Go Gentle on Your Skin

Start with a gentle, hydrating cleanser that removes impurities without over-stripping natural oils. Avoid harsh soaps or foaming cleansers that can dry out your skin further.

These [skin care products for women](https://truedermasa.com/collections/skin-care) are widely available in India and cater to all skin types, including sensitive skin.

# 3. Moisturize, Moisturize, Moisturize

# Best Exfoliators in India:

* Forest Essentials Facial Scrub Sandalwood & Orange Peel
* mCaffeine Coffee Face Scrub
* The Body Shop Tea Tree Squeaky Clean Scrub

Remember to follow up with a moisturizer to lock in hydration.

* Innisfree My Real Squeeze Mask (Aloe)
* Dot & Key Water Drench Hydrating Mask

These are among **India’s best skin care products** for women, offering hydration and nourishment.

* Hand Creams: The Body Shop Almond Milk & Honey Hand Cream, Plum BodyLovin’ Hand Cream

* Always remove makeup with a gentle, hydrating cleanser.

I practiced keto a few years ago and after I brought my health more or less in order, I gave up this diet mostly because I'm overcome by boredom, if I can put it that way, that is, everything becomes somehow monotonous and bland in terms of emotion, I would even say that during this period emotions are almost absent or very muted. I associated all this with the fact that for a full hormonal background, some more carbohydrates are still needed (I'm not talking about refined sugars and products that include them). Now, several weeks after my fast, I switched to keto (mostly omad) due to health problems and the only way to feel normal is bulletproof coffee. So I would like to ask you the same or is it just my body that reacts to the lack of carbohydrates.

1h12te6,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1h12te6/dont_quite_understand_coffee_metrics_latte/,Don’t quite understand coffee metrics - Latte ,"I don’t think I quite understand coffee metrics. 

Straight to the point, I have a Delonghi Eletta Explore (I’ve posted in Super Autos too, but maybe someone from here can help too). 

My goal is to make a Latte which is the same as Costa Coffee takeaway cups, in size and taste. I get Costa isn’t popular, but I’ve always loved their lattes. I’m not a big coffee drinker.  

I am using Costa Medium roast beans and semi skimmed milk. From my research, Costa uses 3 shots of espresso for Medium size takeaway Lattes. 

So, am I correct in saying, that one shot is one 18gram puck? Which equates to 36ml. Three shots would be 108ml.

The puck size my machine makes is 9gram, so, in order to get a single proper shot size, I would need to run the espresso option twice, correct? Or, would I run it once, but extract 36ml from just one puck? 

Assuming the former is correct, in order to get the same amount of espresso from my machine as Costa, I would need to run the espresso option 6 times? 

The medium takeaway cups are 400ml, 400 - 108 =292. I would then need 292, give or take a little, of milk? 

This morning, I ran the latte option, which gives me 36ML of espresso from the 9g puck, 300ml of milk. I then ran the single espresso option again, which game me another 36ML. In total this is 72ml, considerably less than Costa 3 shot but, my latte tasted disgusting, very strong and bitter compared to Costa.

Proof that even I can be distracted enough to forget about tacos.  Who knew?

Kids played with cousins, one of wife’s friends from college children, then went to a birthday party with a whole new set of kids.  They quickly and easily made friends with all of them.  I find that funny.  Kids just walk up to each other and say “hi.  Want to play?”  And the other says “yes!” about 90% of the time like they have been waiting for the invitation for their entire life.  I ask my son “what was their name?”  He says “no idea.”  

I think to myself, why can’t adults be like that?  Bars are more or less playgrounds for adults, right?  Why can’t adults just walk up and say hey, wanna hang out?  And the person go YES!  And then we’re best friends.  For life.  And I never even need to know your name.  It would make things a lot easier.

Go make a friend today.  Be like a child and just casually be friendly and talk to strangers.  Who knows?  Maybe you’ll meet a new best friend.  ",1,1732709104.0,widowers,1,1.0,False

1h12qx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1h12qx2/whats_the_best_coffee_machine/,What's The Best Coffee Machine?,"Hey coffee lovers! I've been on quite a journey testing different coffee machines over the past few years, and I thought I'd share my experiences to help those looking to upgrade their morning brew setup.

After trying numerous coffee makers, from basic drip machines to fancy espresso makers, I've finally found what I consider to be the perfect balance of quality and convenience. I recently discovered some amazing options on Amazon that I wish I'd known about sooner.

Let me break down what really matters when choosing a coffee machine:

Brew Quality: This is obviously the most important factor. You want something that maintains the right temperature and extraction time for the perfect cup.

Convenience: Nobody wants to spend 20 minutes making coffee, especially in the morning. Quick setup and easy cleaning are crucial.

Durability: A good coffee maker should last years, not months. I've had my share of disappointments with cheaper models that broke down too soon.

Here's what I've learned: spending a bit more upfront actually saves money in the long run. Check out these well-rated coffee machines here: https://athometouch.com/coffeemachine

Some key features to look for:
- Programmable settings
- Temperature control
- Auto shut-off
- Water filtration system
- Easy-to-clean parts

I personally love machines with built-in grinders because fresh-ground beans make a huge difference in taste. The aroma of freshly ground coffee beans in the morning is unbeatable!

The best part about modern coffee makers is their versatility. Whether you're into strong espresso shots, creamy lattes, or just a classic drip coffee, there's a perfect machine for everyone.

Pro tip: If you're serious about your coffee, look for machines with pre-infusion features. This moistens the coffee grounds before brewing, resulting in better extraction and fuller flavor.

I've found some great deals on high-quality coffee machines here: https://athometouch.com/coffeemachine

One thing I've noticed is that prices can vary significantly throughout the year. Right now, there are some pretty sweet deals available.

Remember, a good coffee machine is an investment in your daily happiness. Nothing beats starting your day with a perfect cup of coffee made exactly how you like it.

The first time in years that I've had an episode even close to this, and definitely the worst. It's feels stupid because I think I was triggered by some events in a stupid TV show, that hit a few parts of my real life in a bad way I guess, and it'd been making me anxious for a couple days. Then I had a kinda shit night, but woke up feeling mostly alright. Then on the drive, that triggering thing crossed my mind and all of a sudden I did not feel like I was all the way there. It scared the hell out of me because I knew I was driving, and it's dangerous to be out of control on the road ofc but I couldn't feel my body well, didn't know what to do. 

I only had a couple exits to go so I clenched my arms so tight gripping the steering will and forced my way through it fucking terrified for those couple minutes. I was in the far right lane, wasn't hitting the rumble strips and cars going past me weren't acting like a was veering into their lane or driving like an asshole. So I was like, okay, it's probably okay and I'm just freaking out bc my body is all fucked up and I don't know what's going on. Sipping my coffee and feeling the heated seat in my car helped that floating away feeling some. 

I got to work like 10 min later and I didn't feel quite that detached anymore but all day I was messed up, especially earlier on. I kept spacing out, feeling like I was losing time. I threw my coffee cup away and didn't even remember doing that until I went to look for it later and saw it in the trash can. Sometimes I'd feel like I came back to my senses, then everything was TOO tangible, too bright, loud. Then I'd space out again.

And I was thinking like, it's nothing, I'm just being weird, I'm just tired. But it didn't feel like when I'm tired. I got a little more with it throughout the day but I still felt like shit, more and more. Just anxious and irritable and I just wanted the day to be over all day so I could go home and go to sleep.

Did that, luckily slept okay, but then I woke up today totally anxious about it because I could very clearly see the difference between my brain today vs yesterday, and that it felt normal, and yesterday didn't, so like what the fuck was that?

I've been trying to do some googling about panic attacks, derealization, etc. But idk what to do about it. I feel like I need to talk to someone to figure out if that's even what happened and figure out what I should do? But I don't want to talk to people in my life about it, and setting up with a therapist will take weeks probably? And I'm scared for how I deal with this before then because what if it happens again? How often do these usually happen? Was it just a one-time fluke? I'd had a particular busy and stressful week prior to this. And everything I see about it online is like, reassure yourself it's just a panic attack, you're not in real danger etc. etc. but I was DRIVING? So that's already real danger.

So I guess just wondering if someone who knows more about this than me can give any guidance on how I should react? Or just relate even I guess.",1,1732708538.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

I have been with my husband for 8 years, engaged 6 married 2. We starting living together shortly after we started dating and his dad was always around. His mom passed, so his dad is all he has left which was no issue to me, we all lived together. I never got to meet his mom... his dad would help out around the house, cook dinner and go grocery shopping. I worked full time at an amazing job I feel my husband didn't like too much. He is traditional and I believe he thinks it's best for me to stay home. He would hate male attention from my job/long hours as I became the manager at where I worked.... my husband and his father work for a family business so they also work full time. They pay rent I paid for food etc. Over the years things have changed, chores at home became so much more. Working until 6/7pm plus a drive and coming home to make dinner with my husband..his father in law just waiting on the couch watching us cook...He no longer grocery shops only for himself like bread, chips and icecream and no longer cleans. Will eat toast and get crumbs everywhere and will use his finger to clean it...eat with his mouth open- openly fart around food will not say excuse me or thank you for any type of meal... Will make himself coffee in the morning with the dishwasher clean and not unload it- only to put the dirty dishes in the sink. My husband does a lot of the work as well but it was getting to me to have to work all day and take care of everything once I get home. My husband and his dad work the same shift of 7-3 Monday to Friday and I work 9-6. Normally would clean in the morning before I left with the alone time I had. After we got married, shortly after my FIL got sick and was in the hospital for 2 weeks with COPD and panic attacks. The 2 were in rough shape, finally he came out of the hospital and stayed home on oxygen- husband and I worked as normal... he stayed home for about 7-8 months.. not moving off the couch, no willingness to live .... my husband and I had NO alone time together as his dad no longer left the house. The sounds he makes 10x worse now horking, coughing and farting everywhere. I'm constantly watching for his cord around the house... trying to not trip .... with COPD we caught him trying to smoke in his room we don't smoke in the house. I found a random number written on a note pad and i googled it, it was a call girl number... I didn't know who wrote it so obvi that makes things tough at home...he would just not move off the couch, he would watch us clean around him and cook. Once again never saying thank you for anything... my husband has ""spoken"" to him a few times and he finally felt good enough to go back to work.... for me work was getting overwhelming with home life so I quit. I stayed home for a bit taking care of the house and making dinner for them but it was killing me.. His dad is just so lazy. I found work again to make myself happy to do something for myself and my husband is not too happy I'm working again but did it anyways so I told him the work has to be split and I can't be full time taking care of everything. His dad will have to start helping out again. His dad knows I'm back to work now... Anyways I made dinner, his dad is always the first to eat-  cleaned up and washed the work clothes put on the dishwasher and headed to bed. Wokeup in the morning to a coffee made and the dishes not put away, his dad has been up for hours and couldn't be bothered to put them away.. I told my husband I am fed up and my husband tells me well, I would have just done it without you knowing like the last few times and you wouldn't have been mad... like he is enabling him. I understand it's his father but come on, he is constantly complaining to me how lazy he is as well but I feel I am starting to not love him the same I almost want to leave, and we fight often about the same thing. This. I just wanted to vent and see some other perspective as I don't have many friends but I also don't like to share my business.... am I wrong for thinking it's possibly time to give up? I once did snap and yell at his dad to clean up after himself and he did for bit but it's not my place.... I feel he is a like a child I have to look after and I can't have my own with my husband ...I don't know anymore. ",2,1732708242.0,inlaws,2,0.75,False

Who has to travel for his work for 4days where his ex lives

Hello called and meet for coffee 
At last she suddenly said out "" Can I live with you today !?"" Hello didn't get it first after ( you know ) 

everything together, swimming together, chatting on the beach together. When I was working, he was also working and then went back to my hotel again. In total he was at the hotel for 3 days.

So yeah we did sex after sex after sex, I can't count how many times I've fucked her. And it hits different.

I cum inside, face, mouth then swallowed, and we did anal too.

What amazes me is, it's like he and I know how to please each other. It's like we both never forget what makes our partner happy. Honestly, yesterday's experience was really good for me personally.

On the last day when checking out, he told me 'don't contact me unless you're in Bali'. So yeah after I went back to Java, I didn't contact him again.

He only had time to take me to the airport, kissed me in the car and then he pulled away.",1,1732708211.0,DarkySecret,0,1.0,False

I used to rely on cafes for my daily coffee, but as my caffeine cravings grew, I started wondering: *Why not brew my own at home?* Initially, I thought it would save me money, but after some research and calculations, I realized it’s more about the **taste** and the **experience** than just saving a few bucks.

So here I am, diving into the world of home espresso! Here’s my setup, along with why I chose each piece:

Breville Dual Boiler - Upgraded from my initial target (Bambino/Plus) thanks to an amazing White Friday deal (AED 3500 or \~920USD).

Baratza Encore ESP - Highly recommended for beginners by YouTubers and Reddit coffee enthusiasts.

CAFEMASY Bellow for grinder - This was purchased after a few frustrating days with the Baratza Encore ESP, which had significant issues with coffee grounds retention and buildup.

Bottomless Portafilter - a budget-friendly Amazon bottomless portafilter to better analyze shot quality

I hope to keep improving as I go deeper into the world of home espresso. If anyone has recommendations for a grinder with low retention for beginners, I’d love to hear your thoughts! ✨

1h12fj3,https://www.reddit.com/r/DatingStory/comments/1h12fj3/bumble_disaster/,Bumble Disaster,"I met this guy on Bumble. We didn’t chat much on the app, but he was straightforward and asked me out for coffee right away. I told him I’d prefer to get to know him a little better first, but he insisted—we had to meet soon since he was heading back to Manila for work.

Curiosity got the best of me, so I agreed.

When we finally met, I was pleasantly surprised. He was easy to talk to, charming even. Tall, fair-skinned, and incredibly smart. After coffee, we decided to find another place to continue our conversation, and time flew by effortlessly.

The next day, he texted me, asking if I had any plans. If not, he invited me to join him on some errands. Sounds like the beginning of something promising, right? Hold on… the twist is coming.

We continued texting after that. Nothing intense, but enough to tell each other we missed each other’s company. I started to like him—he had everything I could ask for: smart, career-driven, tall, and handsome. He made sense, you know? I could even see myself falling for him.

But then life threw a curveball.

I was selected for a prestigious scholarship program. Only six applicants from the Philippines were chosen—and guess what? One of them was his ex-girlfriend. Of all the people!

As fate would have it, I ended up becoming friends with his ex. And that’s when the truth came out. He was a father of four—each child with a different mother. Let that sink in: FOUR kids. THREE mothers. Major red flag. 🚩

But looking back, I realize it was divine intervention. Maybe God was watching out for me, saving me from something I didn’t see coming.

So, no, don’t tell me I haven’t tried putting myself out there. I did. It’s just that maybe—just maybe—relationships aren’t meant for me right now. And you know what? That’s okay.

For now, I’ll take the lessons, the laughs, and the near misses, and keep moving forward.

But yesterday, I went on what might have been a date but might not have been (a guy I'd met through a meetup group I'd joined inivited me out with him, just for a walk) and I caught myself really  pining for my ex again. Only for the really loving side he had in between episodes where he'd wake me up stroking my hair with a cup of coffee or orange juice and run me baths for when I got home etc and the mug he got me for valentines day with a picture of us on. I know it sounds silly, but I've never had any other exs do those nice, loving things.

Then I started spiraling wondering if I'd made the right decision to leave and whether his reactions to minor things really were that over the top or if I just overreacted to his reactions and threw away what we had with all the lovely stuff in between.


He'd throw a strop over stuff like:

I left a knife and fork in a takeaway box
 
I left a juice carton on the table

I threw away a disposable wrapper

I paused to give way to traffic, which had right of way (he often wanted me to push in and risk an accident for the sake of not having to wait 30 seconds)

I forgot to put onions in a sandwich 

Things being out of place (e.g., a mug or a torch, and then the accusations that I'd stolen them would start when I didn't even know these items existed, let alone where they go, or where they've ended up)

I accidentally took the wrong exit at a roundabout (it only took about 2 minutes to turn around

I used a urine sample pot that was identical to all the others by mistake when that was 'his' one from the doctor (they were all completely indistinguishable and I always have some in the house as it recurrent uti and kidney infections and they were next to each other, there was absolutely no reason he couldn't have used one of the others)

Dropping things

Spilling things

I knocked over a glass of Pepsi, which was left on the floor

Not hanging his T-shirts 'the right way' on the airer (I could never remember what the right way was supposed to be, who even has a right way to do something so mundane and inconsequential?)

Forgetting to take the laundry out

I ate the last piece of bread and forgot to buy another loaf (apparently this warranted waking me up at 7am on my day off to go out and buy more for him, instead of doing so himself or just having something else for breakfast)

I didn't wake him up for an appointment that I didn't even know he had (he had an alarm clock, btw)

I didn't give him a back massage at 11pm when I had been up since 6am, ram a metric marathon race, and had to get up early for work the next day

There's so many more examples 


I was just wondering who can relate? Is this a common tactic to make you walk on eggshells? Was I overreacting when I got upset that he was shouting at me, accusing me of not caring about him?

I practiced keto a few years ago and after I brought my health more or less in order, I gave up this diet mostly because I'm overcome by boredom, if I can put it that way, that is, everything becomes somehow monotonous and bland in terms of emotion, I would even say that during this period emotions are almost absent or very muted. I associated all this with the fact that for a full hormonal background, some more carbohydrates are still needed (I'm not talking about refined sugars and products that include them). Now, several weeks after my fast, I switched to keto due to health problems and the only way to feel normal is bulletproof coffee. I would like to ask if everyone has such a reaction to the lack of carbohydrates or is it not quite suitable for me in the long term? And another question, if anyone has experience with adding a little xylitol to bulletproof coffee?",1,1732706486.0,ketoIF,0,1.0,False

I recently got really brave and messaged a job for a small internship. not even a committed full-time job, this is just about an internship.

Now, you don't know me, But I'd describe myself as the ""tiktok-vibes"" queer person. I had colored hair most of my life. I'm alterantive, mostly wore goth or punk inspired outfits, I had a mullet and emo hair most of my life, piercings in the face and heavily pierced ears. I also have tattoos and wear clunky shoes and most of my life loved jewlery. You get the picture.

I'm trans masc, and very small and two yrs on T, so I start passing.

Sadly I havent had my name change yet, which is upcoming for my passport running out and needing changing anyways.

I walked into this place where i got invited for a job interview. I was so excited and you gotta understand I'm deeply depressed so i bascially never feel very happy about many things, just look at capitalism.

Anyways, their place looked super cozy. Multiple employees looked like me, mullets, colored hair, piercings. Truely not the place where you think you get discriminated against. Their lobby was so cozy and they all smiled and brought each other coffee, tea and snacks, it was still early in the morning. all of them gave me nice ""hellos"" and i was a bit intimidated. 

Now you gotta understand, I'm autistic and my face doesn't move. it just stays still when i feel all my emotions and weirdly enough people percieve me differently than i feel on the inside and the way i talk is often offputting and awkward to folk.

their office had this cutesy decor, just like my home. maximalist. plants everywhere. soft colors, pictures, stickers, memes printed out, figurines on desks, overall very sweet and colorful.

i loved it. i saw the exact image of the best-case scenario of me working there. and then you had to understand, all my life i have been told that i needed to ""dim it down"" in the workplace. I dont have colored hair anymore, took out my facial piercings and wore very basic clothing, no visible tattoos.

So i walked into this place, that was bascially made for me and had to watch people misinterpret my emotions and responses all the time, while i felt like dying on the inside, knowing those people are like me, but there heteronormative, neurotypical notions of how to see the world got me to be the outcast once again.

the pain i feel about being rejected from a workplace like that, brimming with visibly alternative queer people and their lovely-homey workdesks...

i got the rejection so fast, i couldn't even count. Because I was nervous and over-confident. because i didn't out myself didn't show my inner true me, with all its colors and ideas. 

the saddest part is... i am specilized for this very job. I would have loved it there. just bc i listened to their dumb advice of having to dress neat and no colored hair or piercings... 

i put in so much effort for this... i made a presentation they didn't even let me show and i brought the books i worked on prior (this is about a book printer) and showed them off my hand-made skills as a graphic designer and they decided they didn't vibe with me and even ended their rejection off with ""and there wont be further possible places here for you"" but in professional lingo ofc. they bascially rejected me and rejected further applications from me as fast as they could.

I'm heartbroken. I'm angry. I feel bad about it for so long bc i have been bullied in both school and private circles and Idk. it makes me feel so much more depressed, i dont even want to try again. 

I feel like people lied to me. I feel like i should have kept my facial piercings and my blue hair and should have started the interview with an outing ""hey im a trans man btw"". Maybe then they would have opening up to me?

Anyone had the experience yet where they got rejected within their own community??",2,1732706228.0,ftm,6,0.67,False

We planned to get engaged in the coming months. So in love kinda couple that we could see no one other than ourselves. Fully secure and no trust issues at all. 
A few months back we both started work at the same hospital. We were posted at different places. She had a senior who kinda was like her boss. They used to go out just the two of them occasionally for coffee and food as colleagues. The guy is married and has a kid. A month or two in he confesses that he has very strong feelings for her and that he wants to marry her and that his own marriage is very sad and depressing and he doesn’t love his wife and shit like that. And if that is not possible than it’s better if we cut eachother off or he’ll be too sad. They still were at friendship terms after this and I got really uncomfortable and didn’t had a good feeling at allll about all this. Anyways the time passed and they both kept themselves a little reserved but were still in constant connection as friends . One night, they went for coffee in the middle of the night and discussed that we will end this friendship or whatever it is and be professional. My gf told him that she is happy with me and that nothing can happen between them. Anyways I found this out 3-4 days later and my gf told me on her own and said she didn’t initially bec i would’ve got worried that what is happening. I got even more uncomfortable after this but to my relief her posting at this place ended. In the next posting we were together. She said she would go to her old posting once or twice a week to learn and be in practice bec that posting is actually what she wants to chase in the future and i reluctantly agreed bec she needed this. A few weeks back she says to me she wants times to contemplate about marriage and what she wants. I panicked a little but she got me to settle saying she is going no where and she still loves me she just needs time to deal with some things. I asked her what but she wouldn’t say. 
The same week i saw a text on her phone from the old guy. They were talking about his interview at a new place and she was helping him put a good word for him through her connections (she told me about this and i was still uncomfortable and obv she knew it but she would get defensive if i said anything that he is still my friend and i feel sorry for him). Anyways i opened the messaged and was skimming through not to check her chats or anything( i never have checked her chats or mobile ever bec i trusted her fully) but idk what i did that day. I just had a feeling something was not okay between them. Anyways i was skimming through the chats and i saw that he was flirting with her and she was accepting those flirtations and even responding to them (like how he is making her blush in the work place)
I saw this i got dizzy my mind went numb
I was leaving the premises to go and smoke but she was me leaving and came after me. She knew something was not okay. She asked me what I saw what is wrong. She knew what i saw before me. I wasn’t gonna tell her rnow but she knew what had happened. She told me she has developed feelings for him recently and she doesn’t know what to do with them. And she loves me still and alot and the love and feelings for me can’t ever be compared to what she has for him. And that he doesn’t know any of this feelings stuff that she feels like this. Anyways I cried my heart out said things that i wanted to. Like what did I do that she got there. Did i do something to push her.  what was wrong. Anyways she tried to console me that the time she wants is to understand why this has happened and she would go for therapy. She also swore she was gonna tell me all about this and also show me the texts that they were sending after she dealt with her feeling and then she would have asked me if I still wanted to be with her after. But she won’t stop going to that posting and won’t stop seeing him for work(which is not obligated to do at all but doing for personal experience and bec she enjoys the work). But she wont interact with him other than work. Then she started to cut me off a little in the time she needed. She didnt even reply properly to my texts. If i asked questions regarding any of this she said she would answer them later when she is ready and understands what has happened. I was devastated didn’t know what to do. Lost. I asked her to talk a little to me. She told me she isn’t ready for a commitment rnow. She can’t be romantically involved and that she doesn’t know about marriage rnow that what she wants. And she said she definitely doesn’t want kids( before this we were gonna have two kids and i was all about having kids in the future). Then a few days back i found out from a very reliable friend who has worked with the guy that he has done this with around 18-20 girls. And has had multiple affairs. Got caught 5 times by his wife in the hospital (ohh btw his wife works at the same hospital). I told this new info to my gf and she first starts defending him now she is at a neutral stance that this may be true. Also in this time i have been there as a friend to her even though this is the hardest thing i have had to face in my life( although my life has had many rough moments. I almost died twice got molested once and almost escaped a rape but this was something i can’t understand how to deal with.) Even in light if recent events she goes to that posting once or twice a week and spends time there with him although for work. I am there as a friend to her helping her through this even talked to her about how she was sad that the guy may have fake feelings for her and she developed real ones for him(broke me to pieces but still talked to ther through this) I just love her so much i can’t stop thinking about her  Iam broken rnow and just want to know what to do now. Is it okay for her to go and see him like this to learn the work there although she is not obligated at alll for this and she can see what it is doing to me. I feel like I am not at the top of her priority list anymore but she says that’s not the case. She just needs time and that she will come back to me. But idk what to do rnow what to think. I am just lost and depressed severely. I have started smoking again and not just cigarettes ( quitted smoking 3 years back) She says she is sure though that she doesn’t want kids.

1h11umm,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1h11umm/upgrade_to_electric_grinder/,Upgrade to electric grinder,"Hi everyone, I’ve been in the coffee scene for about six months now. My love for filter coffee started on vacation when I had my first taste of a proper brew. When I got back home, I decided to dive in and ordered a basic pour-over setup: a Timemore starter kit with the C2 grinder, scale, and Fish Smart kettle. I’ve been using the V60 primarily, with the occasional French press, and so far, I have no complaints. The C2 grinder has been reliable, and my brews are usually good. If they’re not, I just tweak the grind size until I get the result I’m after.

Now I’m looking to upgrade to an electric grinder, and I’ve been researching non-stop (shoutout to Lance for the endless reviews). My budget is around $500, and I’m torn between a few options. The Timemore 064 is at the top of my list because I’ve been very satisfied with Timemore’s quality so far. The Fellow Ode Gen 2 has always been a dream purchase for me, but I’ve heard that it requires a burr upgrade to really shine. Is that true? The calibration process also seems like a lot of work, which might not be for me. Then there’s the Lagom Mini, which I’m drawn to for its design, but I’ve heard it might be prone to overheating, which makes me hesitant. I’ve also briefly considered the DF64v, though I’m not as familiar with it. As for Baratza and Eureka, I haven’t even looked into their performance because, honestly, I don’t like how they look.

To complicate things, a friend of mine is selling his Timemore 078s for $550. It’s been used daily for a year, mostly for espresso, but I’ll be using it exclusively for filter coffee. He’s a meticulous person, and the grinder seems to be in great condition—no visible scratches or issues. I’m wondering if buying a used grinder is a good idea.

Have you ever wondered how public relations teams manage to control and manipulate narratives surrounding celebrities like Lukola? Why do certain relationships or scandals seem perfectly timed, or why do certain ""spontaneous"" moments look too good to be true? Join me as we dive deep into the PR strategies and tactics used to craft celebrity images, and how fandoms—like Lukola’s—play a huge role in amplifying these stories.

In this AMA, I’ll be breaking down the ins and outs of how PR teams create and sustain public personas, the art of using media for narrative shaping, and how these stories are often exaggerated or even completely fabricated. I’ll also share the truth about what happens when whistleblowers expose these PR tactics.

💬 **Feel free to ask me anything about:**

* **The PR strategies behind Lukola’s public image**
* **How fake relationships and other fabricated stories drive fan engagement**
* **The role of paparazzi photos and staged moments in shaping narratives**
* **The power of social media in building and sustaining PR campaigns**
* **How fans become key participants in amplifying celebrity narratives (sometimes unknowingly)**
* **What happens to those who expose these PR tactics (whistleblowers)**

I’m excited to discuss these fascinating PR strategies and what’s really going on behind the scenes of the Lukola fandom! 🌟""

# Sample AMA Questions You Can Prepare For:

1. **How do PR teams control the narrative surrounding a celebrity like Lukola?**
   * **Answer:** PR teams strategically craft celebrity narratives through a combination of media placements, social media management, and orchestrated public appearances. They create stories—like romances, feuds, or scandals—that help define the celebrity's image and push certain themes, such as ""relatability"" or ""mysterious allure."" These tactics can include fake relationships, staged family outings, or even ""exclusive"" photoshoots that fit the narrative being pushed.
2. **What are some common PR strategies used to amplify a celebrity's image?**
   * **Answer:** One major strategy is to create viral moments or stories—such as a staged public appearance or ""spontaneous"" encounter—that resonate with fans. PR teams also use ""leaked"" exclusive content, set up paparazzi photoshoots, and partner with influencers to spread these narratives. The aim is to tie the celebrity to certain values, emotional moments, or current trends, making them appear relatable, aspirational, or even controversial.
3. **How do fabricated relationships work, and why do celebrities like Lukola engage in them?**
   * **Answer:** Fake relationships are often strategically fabricated to boost a celebrity’s public image or deflect negative attention. For Lukola, these relationships can serve multiple purposes—ranging from appealing to specific fan demographics to boosting publicity for a new project. Often, PR teams will create buzz around a romance, giving the public something to latch onto emotionally, all while controlling the narrative.
4. **Can fans unknowingly become part of the PR strategy?**
   * **Answer:** Absolutely. Fans often play an integral role in spreading these narratives, whether by sharing photos, participating in hashtag campaigns, or commenting on posts. Many fans don’t realize they’re supporting a pre-planned PR story, but their engagement helps amplify the narrative and keep the celebrity in the public eye. Essentially, they become unwitting promoters of the PR campaign.
5. **How do PR teams use paparazzi photos to shape a celebrity’s image?**
   * **Answer:** Paparazzi photos are often staged or heavily curated to tell a specific story. Whether it's a picture of Lukola in a romantic setting or engaging in an “authentic” everyday activity, these photos are crafted to project the right image to the public. A casual coffee run might be turned into a “wholesome” or “mysterious” moment that aligns with the narrative the PR team is pushing.
6. **What role do ""extras"" (paid actors or influencers) play in creating these narratives?**
   * **Answer:** Paid actors, influencers, or even members of a celebrity’s PR team often appear in staged photoshoots or public events to make scenes look more authentic. These extras might be cast as family members, friends, or random bystanders, and their presence helps elevate the narrative. This tactic ensures the photos feel genuine, even if they’re fully orchestrated.
7. **What are the ethical implications of PR manipulation in fandoms?**
   * **Answer:** The ethical concerns around PR manipulation lie in how it affects both fans and celebrities. While PR is meant to shape a public image, it can be deceptive, manipulating emotions and blurring the line between reality and fiction. Fans may feel emotionally invested in fabricated stories or relationships, which can distort their perception of reality. This kind of manipulation raises questions about the authenticity of celebrity culture.
8. **How can fans spot when PR strategies are at play?**
   * **Answer:** Fans can look for certain clues like repetitive patterns in the timing of events, the overuse of particular hashtags, the lack of authenticity in public appearances, or signs of over-curation in photos. If a photo feels too perfect, the setting too ideal, or the narrative too timed with a product release or media campaign, it’s likely that PR strategies are in play.
9. **What happens to whistleblowers who expose PR tactics?**
   * **Answer:** Whistleblowers who expose PR strategies face significant risks. They might be ostracized from the industry, lose their job, or face legal consequences depending on the confidentiality agreements they’ve signed. The celebrity or PR agency may take legal action or use their influence to silence the whistleblower. However, whistleblowers who go public with the truth can also gain support from fans who value transparency. It's a double-edged sword—speaking out can be costly but also lead to a deeper understanding of how the industry works.

This AMA will offer a rare opportunity to pull back the curtain on how PR works behind the scenes, especially in the context of the Lukola fandom. Fans will learn more about the PR machine that shapes what they see in the media, and how they unknowingly contribute to these narratives. By discussing whistleblowers and how they risk their careers to expose these PR tactics, we’ll also explore the darker side of the celebrity PR world.

I'd actually like to work again but I just can't handle the usual jobs or long shifts. I'd probably have to work remotely but honestly I'm more focused on getting better mentally and eventually leaving this town.

Also I'm a bit of an adventurous introvert! I love going out and just enjoying the day but doing it too often really zaps my energy. Ideal outings would be going to an aquarium, museum, bookstore, coffee house, restaurants, or random adventures! I also would really love to go out and dance! Not sure I'd like a club tho?

We barely speak to neighbours, classmates and colleagues and friends are hard to come by. If you have to move to a new town for a job you can end up not knowing anyone outside of work.

Exercise can be a good way to get to meet people. When you are exercising alongside other people you share something in common with them. That means there is an easy way to start a conversation and that's all it takes sometimes to make a friend.

I think sports teams and clubs are the best for making new friends. Team mates support one another on and off the pitch. Even if you go to training and carry the water on match days you will be part of the team. You will be appreciated and valued by your team mates. Soon enough you will get your turn on the pitch on match day. Things like tennis clubs practically require you to talk to other players in the club league, you have to arrange matches with them. Everyone at my local parkrun is invited to the local MaccyDs after the run for a bite and a coffee. The staff don't mind all the runners turning up sweaty and muddy. Every sports team has a social aspect. Drinks in the bar with the opposition after a game is just as much part of the team as what goes on during the match. If you do a group class you can chat afterwards even if its to say ""blinking flip that was hard"". Places like martial arts and boxing gyms are all about supporting one another, you learn new skills and how to use them together. Hearing a gym full of people cheer when you do well is a huge boost.

The one form of exercise where social contact is not common is going to the gym and spending time doing cardio and weights. We all know how it goes, headphones on, look down, no eye contact, don't speak unless you are spoken too. I can spend two hours in a gym and not say a word to anyone else in there. I am sure I am not alone like that.

So... why not find your local beer league team and give them a go?",2,1732704309.0,EOOD,0,1.0,False

Just wanted to share a little tip that I wish I had known earlier in my career. If you're searching for barista positions with decent hours and better-than-average pay, consider looking into coffee shops inside big tech companies' office complexes like Amazon, LinkedIn, and Meta. I currently work in Amazon and it's great! Companies such as Aramark, Sodexo, Compass, Gather and Gather hire for these kind of positions.

These places often have coffee shops that follow the shifts of office workers, meaning they're typically open Monday to Friday, with hours around 7 AM to 3 PM or 8 AM to 4 PM. Not only does this give you weekends off, but it can also provide a better work-life balance. Plus, with those hours, you might find it easier to pursue further education or learn new skills to switch careers down the line.

Hope this helps some of you out there looking for a change or just a more manageable schedule. Good luck!",4,1732703999.0,barista,2,0.84,False

1h11chg,https://www.reddit.com/r/lukolaofficial/comments/1h11chg/pr_teams_and_metadata_a_tool_for_narrative/,"PR Teams and Metadata:  A Tool for Narrative Manipulation
","# PR Teams and Metadata: 

Metadata—the technical information embedded in digital files such as photographs—has become a key weapon in the arsenal of PR teams. By manipulating metadata and strategically leaking or amplifying it through controlled accounts, PR teams create illusions of authenticity. This approach enables them to influence public perception, drive fan narratives, and obscure inconvenient truths about their clients. Below is an expanded exploration of how metadata is used, manipulated, and weaponized in celebrity PR strategies.

# What Is Metadata and Why Is It Important in PR?

Metadata contains information about a file, such as:

* **Date and time of creation**
* **Device details (e.g., camera model, editing software)**
* **Geolocation data (e.g., GPS coordinates)**
* **Modification history**

For fans investigating celebrity movements or relationships, metadata can appear to offer clues to authenticity. However, PR teams understand this interest and weaponize metadata to control and manipulate narratives.

# How PR Teams Use Metadata to Mislead Fans

1. **Fabrication and Alteration of MetadataExample:** A celebrity posts a “candid” photo tagged in Paris. Metadata indicates it was taken earlier that day. However, analysis reveals signs of editing, suggesting the photo was staged in advance and metadata altered to align with a fabricated timeline.
   * Metadata can be easily altered using software tools, allowing PR teams to:
      * Change timestamps to make content appear recent.
      * Embed false GPS data to imply the celebrity was in a specific location.
      * Remove evidence of editing software to make photos seem candid.
2. **Strategic Coordination of Metadata and Real-World Events** PR teams synchronize metadata with external events to make fabricated stories more believable. **Examples:**
   * **Flight Timing:** A celebrity posts a photo “taken on the plane,” with metadata showing it was captured mid-flight. PR accounts then leak metadata and align it with flight tracker data to confirm the celebrity’s supposed travel plans.
   * **Hotel Stays:** Metadata might suggest a photo was taken at a luxury hotel, coinciding with paparazzi sightings of the celebrity entering or leaving. The goal is to create a seamless narrative that reinforces their presence in a specific location.
3. **Preemptive Narrative Control** PR teams often release metadata through insider accounts or orchestrated ""leaks"" to control conversations before fans can speculate. **Example:** When a celebrity is rumored to be dating someone, PR teams release metadata aligning with public sightings, such as photos tagged in the same city or location, to fuel the romance narrative.
4. **Distraction and Redirection** Metadata can be intentionally fabricated or “leaked” to distract from damaging truths. PR teams use this to steer fan investigations toward harmless or irrelevant details. **Example:** If a celebrity is accused of being at a controversial event, PR accounts might release metadata showing them at a neutral or positive location, effectively redirecting attention.

# Recurring Figures and Background Elements in Metadata Narratives

A hallmark of PR manipulation is the presence of recurring figures or objects in staged paparazzi photos and social media posts. These elements are often deliberately planted to:

* Add authenticity to staged content.
* Reinforce the metadata narrative.

**Examples:**

1. **Recurring Background Characters:**
   * A person walking a dog or pushing a stroller appears in multiple photos, ensuring consistency between “candid” paparazzi shots and social media posts.
   * Closer analysis reveals these individuals might be PR employees or hired actors who frequently appear in the background to support the narrative.
2. **Objects or Props:**
   * A distinctive car, coffee cup, or branded item may appear repeatedly to create a recognizable motif associated with the celebrity's current PR campaign.
3. **Recurring Locations:**
   * Photos consistently tagged in the same restaurant, hotel, or gym suggest a deliberate effort to link the celebrity with these places, even if they aren’t genuinely frequenting them.

# Examples of Metadata Manipulation in PR Strategies

1. **Staged Travel Narratives**
   * PR teams manipulate metadata to show a celebrity jet-setting to glamorous destinations. **Example:** Metadata from a beach photo suggests the celebrity was in Malibu last weekend. Fans later discover the photo was taken months earlier but reposted with altered metadata to support the illusion.
2. **Fake Relationship Stories**
   * Metadata is often manipulated to suggest two celebrities were together at specific times and places. **Example:** A photo of Celebrity A geotagged in London aligns with a paparazzi photo of Celebrity B in the same location. Metadata from both photos is suspiciously synchronized, suggesting PR involvement in crafting a false narrative.
3. **“Candid” Paparazzi Shots**
   * Paparazzi photos are staged, and their metadata altered to match a celebrity’s social media posts. **Example:** A paparazzi photo showing a celebrity at a coffee shop matches the metadata of their Instagram post, reinforcing the illusion of spontaneity.

# How PR Accounts Exploit Metadata

PR accounts often act as intermediaries in metadata manipulation, leaking data or amplifying narratives to drive engagement. Key tactics include:

1. **Fast Metadata Releases**
   * PR accounts release metadata within hours of a post, demonstrating insider access. These releases often guide fans toward specific conclusions. **Example:** A fan account posts metadata from a celebrity’s photo, “proving” they were at an event. The speed and accuracy of the leak suggest PR coordination.
2. **Controlling the Timing of Metadata**
   * PR teams release metadata strategically to align with trending topics or rumors. **Example:** If fans speculate a celebrity is on vacation, PR accounts release metadata “confirming” their location, even if fabricated.
3. **Amplifying Selective Metadata**
   * PR accounts highlight metadata supporting their narrative while ignoring or downplaying inconsistencies. **Example:** Metadata confirming a celebrity’s location is widely shared, but timestamps showing potential tampering are conveniently omitted.

# Questions for Investigating Metadata Claims

1. **How quickly was metadata released after the post?**
   * **Possible Answers:**
      * **PR-Driven:** Rapid metadata release often suggests insider PR involvement.
      * **Fan-Driven:** Delayed releases may indicate genuine fan investigation.
2. **Does the metadata align with known events?**
   * **Possible Answers:**
      * **PR Fabrication:** Perfect alignment with flight schedules, paparazzi sightings, or rumors often signals orchestration.
      * **Authentic Event:** Inconsistent metadata could indicate a genuine post.
3. **Are there recurring figures or patterns?**
   * **Possible Answers:**
      * **Staged Content:** Recurring characters or locations point to PR-controlled narratives.
      * **Coincidence:** Rarely, similar elements might be unintentional.
4. **Are there signs of metadata tampering?**
   * **Possible Answers:**
      * **Fabrication:** Altered timestamps, missing geolocation data, or editing software traces suggest PR interference.
      * **Unedited File:** Authentic metadata often includes full device and location details.

# How Metadata Misleads Fans

PR metadata manipulation relies on fans’ trust in digital evidence. By presenting seemingly authentic data, PR teams craft believable but false narratives. Fans can protect themselves by:

* **Cross-referencing metadata with independent evidence:** Compare timestamps and geolocation with verifiable sources, like flight logs or local events.
* **Scrutinizing patterns in PR releases:** Look for recurring tactics, such as synchronized posts and staged elements.
* **Recognizing rapid metadata dissemination:** PR accounts often release data too quickly for it to be independently verified.

# Conclusion

Metadata is a double-edged sword in celebrity culture. While it can provide insights into a celebrity’s life, it is also a tool for PR manipulation. By understanding the methods PR teams use to alter, coordinate, and release metadata, fans can approach digital evidence with skepticism and discern the truth behind the carefully constructed narratives.",1,1732703406.0,lukolaofficial,0,1.0,False

I'm 30, and a guy I've been seeing is 26. We matched on Tinder and have been dating casually for coming up to three months. I've tried to count the amount of dates we've been on, but I've lost count. I'd say at least 10-12, and these have included art gallery hangs, dinners, movies, coffees, and sleepovers. We've even just recently planned to go away for a night together a few hours drive and camp in a really beautiful area. Aside from that, we've made plans for Christmas gifts, and movies coming out we wanna see together.  

Things have been going great, this has been the first time I've dated as a sober person, so it all feels quite new and different to me (he obviously knows about my past - recovering alcoholic), and I have to admit, it has been a bit of an adjustment dating completely sober. The one small issue we did have was, about a month into us seeing each other, he had a job interview that would require him to move states. He at least told me before the interview, and I did feel somewhat anxious about it, but he told me I need not worry as he'd probably not get the job. A couple of weeks later, and us still seeing each other twice weekly, we presumed he didn't get the job and that was that, however, he ultimately did receive the job. After a week of deliberation, he decided against the job and decided to stay local. He told me this via text, and I have to admit, I felt a huge sense of relief. When he was weighing his options up, he asked me my opinion, and I had told him ""It's great that you got the job, but I admit I'd be very sad that you would be leaving. Of course I want you to stay, but I don't want you to stay for me"". I also said, that even though we're in the early stages of dating, I could see us giving this a real shot. He agreed. 

It's been about two weeks since he decided against the job, and we've seen each other around 4 times since, and, on reflecting, I've realized we've never had the ""exclusive"" or ""official"" discussion since then. I feel like because I'm older, I should be the one to bring it up. I'm not sure if I'm ready to be someone's ""boyfriend"", however, my stomach turns at the thought of him dating someone else, and to me, that's a sign that I'm very much falling for him. 

Any suggestions on how I should bring this up, or how I could phrase this? I just feel like my old relationships were a drunken haze. This ""relationship"" feels different. Even at times, I feel like we're already exclusive, it just hasn't really been brought up. I paused my tinder and don’t have downloaded, but I’m not sure about him.

She gave me this really cute Tamagotchi and I thanked her profusely for it. She knows I love collecting Tamagotchi and playing with Tamagotchi is my main hobby and interest. On my birthday she passed me this tamagotchi, no box, no instruction manual, just the tamagotchi wrapped up. 

We went out for dinner, and she says that I should pay for her because it’s my birthday and I should treat her. I was fine with that, she always liked leeching off me, I pay for the coffee when we go cafe hopping, I pay for the tickets to the amusement park because “I asked her to go”, I pay for her Uber home because “I can see her location and if she reaches home safely”, I pay for her clothes shopping because “it’s more special as a gift rather than if she bought it herself” 
A lot of these excuses are lame, but I put up with it because it doesn’t bother me anyway, whatever floats her boat. 

When I reached home and tried to use the Tamagotchi, I realised that it is in a horrible condition. The keys aren’t sensitive, barely working, the screen has this green line across it and the colours are just…. off. I know about this model because I’ve thought of getting it before, and trust me, it’s broken. The sound is always glitching, barely can see anything on the screen and it doesn’t respond well to the buttons. 

I went to Carousell (an online platform for people to sell their goods) and went to search for her account. I saw her reviews and found the tamagotchi there. She purchased it from Carousell, left a review for the seller, snd Carousell shows what listing was bought, so I can see who she bought the tamagotchi from. 
The listing read “Broken tamagotchi for sale” and it costed $5. For a brand new one, it’s only $40. 

So she bought a broken tamagotchi on purpose for my birthday? 

I was mad furious. I took screenshots and sent it to her, asking why she bought me a broken tamagotchi, and she replied that “it’s just for collection purposes, you are so unappreciative “

I screenshotted my conversation with her and ranted on Facebook. Now her friends are scolding me with curses and profanity about how I shamed her online and have no gratitude. 
(I even covered her name and profile photo before posting online to spare her some dignity)
