1ghbxns,https://www.reddit.com/r/Maine/comments/1ghbxns/help_me_with_my_list/,Help me with my list?,"Hi all. Visiting Maine soon, with an eye on potentially moving there next year. I work remotely and am exploring my options in New England. 

I'm looking for a small or medium sized town with plenty going on and not too isolated from other places. I like to go to coffee shops, restaurants, volunteer, join groups and socialize, that kind of thing. Not a partier or much of a drinker, but would be cool if there was at least one tavern type place for socializing (not a must though). Like a place where there's always something going on--festivals, events, traditions. A community feel. Like everyone else, I like a walkable, historic, quaint downtown area. 

I'm in my early 30s and I make friends with people of all ages, but would like there to be a decent ""youngish"" population (20s - 40s). 

Prefer a place that is politically moderate, with about even split of Dems and Reps. <--Probably the hardest box to check, when it comes to Maine, but I know these places do exist. 

These are the places on my list so far. Should I take any off (based on what I've said) or add any others? Thanks.

* Camden
* Kennebunkport
* Boothbay Harbor
* Bar Harbor
* Ogunquit

my therapist made me talk about being depressed and i told her it was a pit, but not the type i find when i’m cutting up a mango for you. instead a dark hole that swallows all the good moments and spits out the shell of the person i used to be, while the pit grows and shrinks. as the day passes sometimes i forget it’s there, then i accidentally drown in the blackness and fear. i try not to remember that while my heart breaks, but the next day i try again and again and again and…

in another life i drink coffee and can stomach the idea of losing a fever dream. i don’t run at the first sign of trouble, i don’t make up trouble in my own head. meditation works and so does medication and i never kill my plants. i allow myself to have friendships and don’t question my worth. i draw the planets in the steam after hot showers and my hands know what it means to be loved. i don’t call myself a failure and i can cut up a mango without choking on my smile.

I'm PhillyWriter – Dyslexic Author, Storyteller, and Lover of All Things Spooky from Philly 🌆👻","Hey, everyone! I’m a writer from Philadelphia, excited to connect with fellow book lovers and share a bit about my work. I’m dyslexic, so writing has always been a unique journey for me, but it’s one I wouldn’t trade for anything. I just released The Purple Dawn, a YA thriller with a dash of supernatural mystery inspired by old-school zombie vibes—the green kind that shuffle around moaning “brains…” as they creep up on you.

Here’s a bit more about me:

Writing Style: I write like I’m talking to an old friend, maybe over a cup of coffee (or something stronger, depending on the story!). My Italian-American roots and Philly accent sneak into my storytelling, and I love keeping it real and conversational.

Favorite Genres: I’m all about horror, supernatural mysteries, and dark thrillers. If it’s eerie, gritty, or dives into the unknown, I’m there.

Current Projects: Besides The Purple Dawn, I’m also working on Pangaea, a series where survival and rebellion collide in a world not too different from our own. There’s plenty of tension, found family vibes, and a few twists I can’t wait to share.


Whether you’re a fan of thrillers, curious about the writing process, or just looking for a good book rec, I’d love to chat! Feel free to ask questions, share book recommendations, or drop any writing advice. And if you check out The Purple Dawn By J.M Harding, I’d be thrilled to hear what you think!

Thanks for reading, and I’m excited to join this community!

Since living in my present building for two years, almost every package delivered by UPS has a signature added *by* UPS and not the sender and it takes almost a week longer to receive my packages because they refuse to leave them and return every day to leave a pointless sticky note.

All of these packages have been for my business, which unfortunately does not have a secure or reliable way to get mail, so they have to be sent to my apartment and of course I'm at work...

It has been for anything from a case of espresso to our ipad PoS. In all instances I call the sending company and ask them to remove any signature requirements and hear them say ""but... we don't require a signature. We never request a signature.""

I finally was able to talk to the UPS driver and he put me on the phone with his supervisor who essentially told me ""too bad, we won't deliver without a signature, it doesn't matter what they told you.""

How can they even do that? I even have emails from our coffee vendor describing UPS behavior as ""bizarre"".",1,1730483954.0,UPS,3,1.0,False

After that we went to smoke some weed, she didn’t partake but the 3 of us were pretty fuckin’ blazed for the rest of the night. Fast forward an hour or so we were at a park and she wanted to hold my hand again cause she was cold, this time we interlocked our fingers. So being high and holding a woman’s hand this seriously for the first time definitely set off some fireworks in my head.

Ok fast forward again a couple of days, me her and another girl went to a cafe, the other girl left quite soon and the 2 of us were left alone. I took a coffee and she took tea. We discussed many many things, including adhd, as we both have a very high chance or having it and we ended up being there for 5 HOURS. After we got out we talked for like another 30 minutes, and surprise her hands got cold again so she requested to hold my hand, fingers interlocked ofcourse. This time it felt extra special because we were walking like an actual couple. After some more talking I had to let go of her hand 😥 and go on my bus, we waved to each other and went our ways. 

At school not much has changed between us, but I can’t help myself from looking at her and thinking about her. Damn life was much simpler without women in my life. What do you people think?",1,1730483728.0,AskTeenGirls,1,1.0,False

At the heart of this design is a central marketplace, a communal hub that reflects the vibrant spirit of Columbus and invites everyone to come together in one space.

Beyond the Y-shape, our team, and the teams at Gensler and Moody Nolan, have designed every detail to enhance your experience. Expansive windows will bring in natural light and offer stunning views of the airfield and downtown Columbus. And with a single, efficient security checkpoint, everyone will be able to enjoy easy access to the same amenities, creating a seamless and connected travel experience.

Born into a noble family in Myanmar, Chocho grew up surrounded by refinement and grace, yet he carries his heritage with a light-hearted attitude, viewing his background as a curious piece of himself rather than a source of pride.

Chocho came abroad sent by his parents to study international relations, to gain experience and to be independent. Despite his noble origins, Chocho is grounded, approachable, and surprisingly compassionate, showing a genuine warmth. His mind is as sharp as his wit, and he has a knack for teasing those he likes.

While Chocho loves the luxuries of life—he’s also drawn to simple, meaningful connections. He is renting a studio near the campus and just started work in a cat-cafe as a waiter. He never worked before and have to adjust to this busy environment. Playful children and cat toys distract him constantly!

1ghbcoz,https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/1ghbcoz/dealing_with_uncomfortable_coworker/,Dealing with uncomfortable coworker,"Hello all,  
  
Recently we have a new member in the lab. He seemed very sweet and talkative at first and I did not mind chatting with him. He'd occassionally chat for so long that it would interrupt what I needed to do, but I am good at staying on task and it was fine.

After some weeks, he began to display some strange tendencies. In our tissue culture room, we only have a few hoods. If all are used, you should just wait patiently, which is what every other lab member does. He will make everyone ucomfy and essentially force us out of the hoods by constantly asking how much longer we have. If I say ten minutes, he will kind of huff, exit the room, and come back (NO EXAGGERATION) 30 seconds later... And repeat. He barges in the hoods without asking sometimes if we stand up to get a reagent or count cells... It is so annoying and this has made me dislike him a bit.  
  
Then my coworker brought communal items for everyone in the lab to share (coffee, candy, snakcs). This coworker put his name on these items and claimed them as his own! The entire thing!? My coworker was so shocked she never confronted him. Additionall, my coworkers are all mainly one ethnicitiy (him and I are not), so they frequently speak in their native language. This does not bother me because they speak English to me when we converse. However, this difficult coworker said ""thank you for speaking English"" to one of my other coworkers, and it just came off very rude.

He also is very disorganized with experiments and is unexperienced with the type of work we do. He asks coworkers last minute with help and does not schedule things or give others advance notice. He is not very good at presentations and does not take kind, constructive feedback well. He thinks it is an insult to his intelligence.

He tried to schedule an outside hangout with the lab members but he did not give an exact plan, date, time, etc. He kind of just wanted someone else to plan the entire thing and host it at their own place, not his place.

I genuinely do not enjoy him as a person or coworker. I am able to be friendly and just say hello in passing, but he keeps trying to force conversations and it is terribly awkward. Nobody, and I mean that, enjoys him in our lab. I don't know how to deal with this coworker and I want to be kind, but knowing how he is, it is so unpleasant to be around. Maybe I am just mean. How should I handle him going forward? What would you do in this situation?",4,1730483217.0,labrats,5,0.75,False

I [23F] am back to online dating a while after a breakup so i havent been on them in like 2 years.  Other than the guys that are straight up bad or dont want anything serious. This is the second time i match with a guy, we talk a bit then exchange socials and talk a bit more. I always expect that after some exchange the person will propose a coffee or something. But they dont. With my last match i ended up suggesting myself ( so im not just sitting there doing nothing) but he got wishy washy about it and said yes but didnt suggest a concrete plan. Eventually ive had enough and unmatched. Same thing happened with another guy. Okay we’ve only been talking for like 4 days and i know he’s busy this week. But still i want concrete plans even if they are far off. I didnt message him at all yesterday and when i hinted today saying i forget to reply sometumes he was like it’s okay nobody is perfect haha i lowkey was pissed at the comment and when i added that i just dont like texting much and prefer talking irl he was like ohh me too 😊 then proceeded to talk about something else. Now   im losing interest and dont even want to reply despite the fact that the guy doesnt seem very bad. But im just confused about this, for me sitting in front my phone writing random stuff to a stranger doesnt appeal to me, i prefer to go on 2-3 dates to see if the person is worth my time and only then i like texting ( what i said was half a lie i actually like texting but only when it comes to friends or when i know the person w my ex we used to talk on phone a whole lot). Even my ex dates back on the day always suggested the date quick. Do guys prefer texting to see if it’s worth going on a date or what? Like i said texting strangers doesnt mean anything to me.

Oh and also literally the same thing happened with a girl friend of mine, and when she was very direct and confronted the guy about it he tried gaslighting her saying she was stirring a fight and when she showed me the texts she was very clearly not so she just unmatched.

Anyway, this is half a rant half a question. Any advice on how i go about it is also welcome. Im tired of online but dont have much going on in real life sadly i wish i could see more people",1,1730483047.0,dating,4,1.0,False

Am I being dramatic? ,"So I married the LOML in September and mother in law has aways been a bit offish with me ever since I stepped foot in his house ten years ago. 

I’ve had various run ins with her, but I’ll just point out the most recent ones

At our wedding she insisted infront of everyone that she just wanted a photo of her children together, nothing to mention me the bride or anything. I brushed it off cos it my day but still.

She didn’t get me a birthday present nor made any attempts to drop it round. Says she will organise to go out for coffee but has not and to be honest I’m so glad of that.

Invites my partner to family birthdays on my late shifts on purpose. 

Visits without me around, she makes sure I’m on late shift.

Her partner is very generous and I was having car trouble a year ago and he kindly gave me a car to use on the assumption that I will buy it off him, I have the money here but he will not give me and answer about how much he wants. It’s a decent car probably only worth about 2k but I’ve kept it right and I will give him the money when he asks.

My partner changes his cars a lot and we are just starting out a coffee van business (mainly my husband as he is a barista) and every time she finds out this has happens she asks when I am paying for the car. The car is nothing to do with her or my partner it’s to do with me and her partner which I’m in contact with and I’m constantly asking how much he wants and when he wants it. He always replies saying I haven’t even thought about it… 

I just don’t understand why she keeps on asking as if I’m so rude not to expect to pay. 

And why doesn’t she discuss with me why is it always my partner? 

I have muted her on everything and when she messages our group chat I ignore. It’s hard having such an awful MIL. She never even congratulated husband on his new venture just was making other stupid suggestions and suggesting things that she wants to do. I put this down to her mentioning to husband a few months ago that her partner had got some money and going to invest in a coffee van, this is the only thing I can put that down to.

When she pops up on my phone my chest starts to hurt so much she is probably the cause of my MH issues.

The morning sun rose over the camp, casting long shadows across the grass as Lethira and her family gathered outside the RV for breakfast. 

She Had changed to a fitting gray t-shirt and dirt colored cargo pants.

Lina sat beside her mother, now wearing a pink shirt and denim shorts, sipping from a steaming mug of coffee. Across from her, Lathen, Lunira, Lemiora, and Liriana helped themselves to the spread of food laid out on the folding table.

Lina was munching on a sandwich filled with savory meat, enjoying the taste, when Liriana asked, “What do you usually eat for breakfast in the human realm, Lina?”

“Well,” Lina began, “sometimes I have cornflakes, just like this. Other times, I eat toast or sandwiches. And of course, there’s pizza!”

“Pizza?” Lemiora raised an eyebrow, intrigued.

Lina grinned. “Yeah, it’s this round bread with sauce and cheese, sometimes with meat or vegetables. It’s really popular.”

Lathen leaned in. “Sounds a lot like **Dwarven pie**. Thick crust, cheese, herbs.”

Lethira nodded. “Close enough. Dwarven pie has a thicker crust and richer spices. Pizza is thinner and quick-baked, but you get the idea.”

Luridar, quietly sipping his coffee, smiled as he listened to the banter. “And what else?” he asked, looking to Lina.

“Burgers,” Lina said. “It’s just meat between two slices of bread, but it’s so good.”

Suddenly, Lathen glanced skyward. “Look at that,” he said, pointing upward.

Lina followed his gaze and gasped as she saw several waiverns gliding through the morning sky, their wings spread wide as they soared effortlessly through the air.

“Wow,” Lina whispered, staring up in awe.

“They’re stretching their wings,” Lathen explained. “Waiverns don’t like staying penned up for too long.”

“Can we go see them?” Lina asked, her excitement growing.

Lethira smiled at her daughter’s eagerness. “We can try. The pens aren’t far. And if we’re lucky, we might even see a dragon. Though dragons tend to roam wherever they please.”

“A dragon? That would be amazing!” Lina exclaimed.

Lethira turned to the others. “What do you say? Should we take a trip and see the waiverns—and maybe a dragon?”

Lathen nodded eagerly. “I’m in.”

Liriana beamed. “It sounds wonderful!”

However, Luridar shook his head. “I’d love to join, but I have matters to attend to with the other nobles and officials. Lots of things to discuss.”

Lethira gave her father a knowing nod. “Understood. We’ll take the Rivian and go ourselves. You’ll have to catch up with us later.”

Luridar smiled warmly. “I’ll hear all about it when you return. Take care.”

With that, Lethira stood, brushing the crumbs from her shirt and pants. “All right, let’s get ready. We’ll leave soon.”

As the family gathered their things, Lina’s excitement grew. The chance to see waiverns—and possibly even a dragon—felt like a dream come true. 

The family gathered outside the Rivian, admiring the sleek vehicle as Lethira pulled out a small, glossy key fob. She pressed a button, and the Rivian chirped to life with a soft beep. The lights flashed, and the doors unlocked with a smooth mechanical sound, causing a few of them to exchange surprised glances.

“What was that?” Lemiora asked, taken aback by the unfamiliar noise.

Lethira chuckled. “That’s just the car letting us know it’s unlocked and ready. Humans have little ways of making sure they don’t forget.”

Lathen raised an eyebrow, still peering cautiously at the vehicle. “It speaks to you?” he asked, half-joking.

“Not quite,” Lina said with a grin, “but it sure feels like it sometimes.”

With that, they began climbing inside, still marveling at the vehicle as the rest of the scene continued with their initial reactions and instructions about the seatbelts.

Lemiora took the front passenger seat and ran her hands over the smooth material of the dashboard. “This is so…different,” she said, marveling at the technology.

Lethira smiled and reached over, tapping the touchscreen to bring up the vehicle’s interface. “It’s called a Rivian. Fully electric, no need for horses, no need for fuel. It can drive long distances and navigate by itself if needed.”

She then gestured to the seatbelt, “And before we start, everyone needs to put this on,” she said, buckling herself in. “It’s called a seatbelt—it’s for safety.”

Lemiora fumbled with the strap for a moment before figuring it out. Lathen in the third row grumbled slightly, “Seems like a lot of fuss for sitting in a cart.”

“It’s not like any cart you’ve been in before,” Lethira said with a grin, “trust me on that.”

In the second row, Lunira looked around, intrigued by the vehicle's spaciousness. “What else does it do?” she asked.

Lina leaned over from her seat beside her. “There are heated seats, and you can adjust the temperature however you like. Oh, and there’s a sound system too. Music plays from all around you—mom and I listen to it when we travel.”

Liriana, sitting next to her, was still fiddling with the seatbelt. “How do I get this thing to stay?” she asked, frustrated.

“Here,” Lina said, leaning over to help. “Just pull it across and click it into place.”

Lathen, who had finally managed to secure his belt, muttered, “I feel like I’m being strapped into a siege engine.”

Lethira laughed and turned on the engine, which hummed to life almost silently. “Well, let’s see how you all feel once we get moving.”

As soon as everyone was settled, she pressed the accelerator, and the Rivian surged forward, leaving the RV and the camp behind in a cloud of dust. Lemiora’s eyes widened as the vehicle picked up speed rapidly. “By the gods, it’s so smooth!” she exclaimed.

Lunira grabbed the handle on the door, her knuckles turning white. “This is faster than a galloping horse!”

Lethira shot her a reassuring glance. “Don’t worry, I’ve done this many times. This is just the beginning.”

Lathen, still a little skeptical from the back, leaned forward to peer through the window. “You weren’t joking when you said it wasn’t like any cart,” he admitted, looking out at the rapidly passing landscape.

Lina, used to the speed by now, grinned back at him. “Told you.”

The family exchanged glances, still adjusting to the unfamiliar experience, but slowly beginning to relax as they realized just how advanced—and safe—the human vehicle was. The morning sun shone through the windows as the army camp's limits came into view, excitement slowly taking over any lingering nerves.

“Next stop,” Lethira said, her voice full of anticipation, “the waiverns and maybe, just maybe, a dragon.”

The Rivian rumbled past rows of tents and makeshift shelters stretching across the campgrounds, where soldiers from every corner of the Empire busied themselves in a mix of tasks. Here and there, an elvish archer honed their aim with a drawn bow, or a squadron of orcs practiced formation, though most soldiers were occupied with more mundane jobs: Wolfkin hefted crates of provisions, dwarves meticulously sharpened swords and repaired armor, and goblins darted about with papers and messages. A group of Harpies squabbled over rations, while Tigerkin wrestled with tangled netting, laughing as they worked to set up a storage area.

Lina’s focus never wavered, her tablet capturing every moment, her eyes glued to the different species and activities that made the camp feel like a bustling, self-sustained city.

The Rivian rolled to a slower pace as Lethira caught sight of a glimmer in the distance: a tiny, iridescent familiar figure hovering amidst the bustle—a fairy, its eyes fixed on their vehicle, smiling at her. The fairy’s glow flickered like a far-off star, captivating and brief, and then it was gone, vanishing into the background.

As they neared the wyvern pens, Lethira glanced over to her family. “Would you all be up for taking Lina to the wyverns while I meet with some old friends?”

Lemiora and Liriana shared a look, nodding in agreement, while Lathen grinned. “I think we’d all like to see her reaction up close.” 

Lina barely registered the conversation, too entranced by everything unfolding outside. 

Lethira nodded, satisfied. “I’ll meet you back here by midday for lunch,” she said, casting a final look at her family and Lina, already deep in her surroundings. She took her own phone and snapped a picture of her family and Lina looking around. 

With that, Lethira turned the vehicle back toward her comrades’ area, ready to reconnect with the team she hadn’t seen in years.

The stench hit Lina first—a thick, eye-watering scent of manure that made her crinkle her nose and fight the urge to turn away. She wasn’t alone in her reaction; her elven relatives, usually so graceful, couldn’t hide their own discomfort as they gagged and covered their noses with sleeves or hands. The smell seemed to permeate the whole area, as if it was part of the air itself.

But as Lina looked up, the smell was soon eclipsed by the sheer sight of the wyverns. Massive creatures towered above them, each one as tall as a small building and twice as long, with wings stretching out wide enough to cast a shadow over the entire pen. They were true draconic beasts, scales glinting in hues of emerald, cobalt, and onyx, with eyes that gleamed like gemstones set in ancient statues. Despite their size and ferocity, they moved with a controlled grace, aware of every twitch and breath of those around them.

The wyverns’ pens, though makeshift, were enormous, designed to allow each creature space to stretch, feed, and rest comfortably. Some pens were empty, their massive iron gates standing open, while others held wyverns greedily devouring piles of meat from horse-drawn carts heaped high. Another line of carts, their wheels creaking, slowly rolled by, loaded with fresh manure, the smell making her grimace once more.

Elven caretakers moved among the pens, adjusting the carts, monitoring the wyverns, and occasionally throwing respectful salutes to Lina’s family. She realized they were being recognized—not just as any elves, but as nobles. The handlers’ gazes lingered a bit longer on Lathen and Lemiora, a sign of the respect and familiarity her family commanded.

“Wyverns have always had a bond with us,” Lathen explained, his voice a bit hushed as he admired the creatures. “It’s part of what helped us conquer the Eight Realms.”

Lina’s eyes widened as she took in his words. She already knew the elves had spread their power across multiple realms, but seeing the creatures that made it possible added a weight to the story she hadn’t expected.

“They let only us elves mount them,” Lemiora added, nodding toward a pair of wyverns watching them intently from one of the pens. “But even for us, only a few are chosen.”

“And the dragons?” Lina asked, her voice barely a whisper as she looked up at the sky, hoping to catch a glimpse of one.

Liriana smiled, her gaze distant as if recalling a memory. “The dragons are different. They’re intelligent, almost like us, and can speak in our tongue. But they bow to no one’s will and let no one ride them. They’re free spirits, powerful beyond measure. Many of them also believe in the Prophecy and helped us fulfill it.”

As Lina took in the sight of the wyverns and absorbed the family’s words, a question quietly brewed in her mind: How could the prophecy—the one that had driven the empire to try to conquer the human realms—actually come true, given what she knew? 

—

Lethira approached the entrance to the Shadow Blades' area after parking her vehicle in front, her footsteps confident, and her gaze sharp. Dark sailcloth walls closed off the camp, the crescent moon and dagger emblem painted repeatedly along the fabric. 

As she neared the entrance, an elven guard’s figure appeared, silent and unassuming. His eyes assessed her with a subtle flicker of recognition. Without a word, she lifted her shirt just enough to reveal the faint glow of her tattoo on her hip— normally hidden, but unmistakable in the quiet light. The guard nodded, his stance relaxing slightly.

“Blade Master,” he acknowledged, a hint of familiarity softening his otherwise formal tone.

Lethira returned the nod, taking in the closed-off entry, then shifted her weight slightly. Instead of heading directly for the false doorway, she eyed a sturdy frame on the side. With a practiced leap, she caught the edge, lifting herself in a single motion. The guard didn't bother to look impressed or interested at her display of skill.

Her boots met the ground on the other side with barely a sound, the landing graceful and soundless.

She straightened, a faint smile tugging at the corner of her lips. 

Lethira moved through the camp, her eyes sweeping over the sea of Shadow Blades—a thousand members strong, she guessed. This was one of eight elite battalions, each hailing from one of the Empire’s realms, but today, she saw faces from all of them gathered here. They were a blend of every race, each member marked by an unassuming appearance that was as effective as their skill. They looked like common soldiers or peasants, blending into any crowd, yet each was worth a full platoon of regular troops.

The camp buzzed with quiet purpose. Elves, orcs, dwarves, and beast folk worked side by side, handling supplies, sharpening weapons, repairing gear, or huddling over strategic maps. Each Shadow Blade acknowledged her with a quick, respectful salute—a brief flick of fingers, almost invisible to an untrained eye—as she passed. She could feel their respect, and perhaps a touch of admiration, but it was subdued, disciplined, just like their movements.

In the heart of the camp, she spotted the Commander's tent, standing in understated contrast to the simplicity around it. Lethira made her way through the last rows, her focus sharp as she approached the shadowed entrance, bracing herself for what lay within.

Lethira flipped the curtain with a flourish, stepping into the tent with a smirk. ""Hey, bitches! Guess who’s back!""

The room froze, everyone’s gaze snapping to her. For a moment, the silence was so thick it felt like time itself had halted. Then, Kreg broke into a wide grin, his deep, booming voice echoing through the tent. ""Ha! Fucking took you long enough to pay us a visit!""

Garrick, the ashen fur Wolfkin, cocked his head, his ears perking up as he grinned broadly. “Well, hey, look who finally found her way back!”

“Look who still hasn't found his shirt!’

Arana, the Tigerkin, raised an eyebrow, a smirk tugging at the corners of her lips while lazily splayed on her chair. “Mmm, look at you, Lethira. I’d almost forgotten how… Did your ass get bigger?.”

“My ass is as nice as ever. Thank you very much!”

The tall and muscular Elvish woman in the chair behind her desk, Rayethra, the Grand Blade Master commanding the battalion, inclined her head, her gaze calm but warm. “It’s good to see you again, Blade Master. You're still as loud as ever.”

Eldaril, the tiny, eerie fairy, zipped up to Lethira with unsettling excitement, her voice a high-pitched whisper that seemed to echo. “Eldaril knew she’d come back. Eldaril sees all. And she knew this day would come! He he he!”

From behind, Talas, the red feathered Harpy, gave a soft nod, his feathers rustling slightly as he spoke in a calm, measured tone. “Welcome back, Lethira. It’s good to have an old friend in camp again.”

Lethira took in each of their familiar faces, a wide grin spreading across her own. 

Lethira's eyes swept across the group as a thought came to her, her gaze settling on Rayethra. “Where’s Urkath?” she asked, expecting to see her old Orcish friend’s familiar, hulking form somewhere in the tent.

The subtle shift in the room was immediate, the friendly warmth dimming. Kreg’s usually lively face grew solemn, and he scratched at his beard, sighing. “Snake-kin ambush… seven years back. It was bad.” He trailed off, shaking his head slightly.

Lethira's face fell as she swallowed hard, a lump tightening in her throat. She looked down, her voice barely above a whisper. “Well, shit,” she muttered, her shoulders slumping just a bit as she grappled with yet another comrade lost.

The quiet held for a moment, thick with unspoken memories, until Kreg broke through it with his usual hearty tone. “So,” he said, his smile returning, “we heard you’ve got a kid now?”

Eldaril darted closer, her tiny wings flickering with excitement, her voice soft yet with that strange echo. “Eldaril has seen her! Little round-eared one. She sleeps pretty… Eldaril knows.”

Lethira chuckled softly, a bittersweet warmth spreading as the somber moment faded into laughter among her friends. “Yeah,” she said, her smile widening at the thought of Lina, “she does sleep pretty… wait, hold up.” She shot Eldaril a suspicious look. “Gods dammit, Eldaril, you have to stop watching people sleep!”

Eldaril’s eyes glinted, a mischievous grin spreading across her tiny face. “Eldaril watches everything… you know this,” she chimed, her voice a playful lilt.

Arana leaned back with an amused smirk. “She's still the same creepy little gremlin.”

“Eldaril knows all secrets,” Eldaril replied, her eyes gleaming as she floated backward, unfazed by the teasing.

Arana’s smirk turned sly as she gave Lethira a knowing look. “You’re not the only one with a child, you know,” she teased. “Garrick here found out he’s got a 26-year-old bastard boy running around.”

Garrick’s grin grew sheepish, scratching behind his ear. “Yeah, surprise! Never knew about the kid until last year. He’s already got more brains than I ever did.”

Arana laughed, nudging Talas with her elbow. “And Talas got married. Got himself a sweet little five-year-old daughter now.”

Talas nodded, a hint of a blush coloring his feathers. “It was, uh, arranged by my parents,” he explained with a gentle smile, “but I can’t complain. She’s a kind soul, and our little one keeps us grounded.”

“Aw, Talas, finally settling down,” Lethira chuckled. “Didn’t think I’d live to see the day.”

“And that’s not all!” Arana continued with a wicked grin. “Kreg here… divorced his husband.”

Kreg rolled his eyes, leaning back with a grunt. “Yeah, yeah. Being a Shadow Blade takes a toll on marriages,” he muttered, his tone somewhere between a joke and a sigh.

Lethira chuckled, giving him a sympathetic pat on the shoulder. ""Well, at least we know you’re still as charming as ever,” she teased.

The group shared a quiet laugh, the camaraderie filling the space and smoothing over the changes time had brought to each of their lives.

Rayethra settled into her chair, steepling her fingers and fixing Lethira with a keen, expectant gaze. “Well, Blade Master, we have a lot to catch up on. And you’ve got some explaining to do.” Her eyes sparkled with curiosity, softened by a hint of affection. “Twenty years off on this mission… and now you’ve got a daughter?”

Lethira took a chair of her own and started “Well, you won't believe the stuff I've seen…”

—

Lina strolled between the massive wyvern pens with her family, still half-distracted by the creatures towering above them. Lemiora, walking just behind her, broke the silence with a gentle question. “Lina, what was it like growing up in the human realm?”

Lina glanced up at her, shrugging lightly as she thought. “It’s… different,” she began. “No wyverns, obviously, or anything like this.” Her eyes drifted up again to one of the wyverns, which was chewing on a hefty chunk of meat. “People are pretty… I guess, ordinary? Busy. They like things fast, you know—always working, driving, that sort of thing.”

“And what about friends?” Liriana asked. “Did you have close ones?”

“Some,” Lina said, her tone turning thoughtful. “But it was hard to get too close. I mean, we moved around a lot. I was mostly with Mom.” She hesitated, then added, “She told me all these stories about home. About you guys, actually.”

The family shared a soft smile at that, and Lemiora looked like she might reach for her hand but stopped. “And your father?” Lemiora asked gently.

Lina’s gaze dropped to the dirt. “I… never knew him. He died in a car accident, before I was born.” Her voice was soft but steady. “Mom said he was a good friend, though. I wish I’d had the chance to know him.”

A moment of silence fell, each family member absorbing Lina’s words with quiet sympathy.

Lina continued sharing glimpses of her life in the human realm. “So I made it into a Realschule,” she began with a hint of pride. “That’s like… well, it’s a school that prepares you for a job, or further studies, or sometimes a trade school. Mom would drop me off in the morning, then go teach languages at another private school.”

Her grandmother listened intently, nodding. “Your mother taught you languages?”

Lina smiled. “More than languages! She also taught me a bit of magic—well, what little we could do there—and martial arts.” She paused, remembering. “She said it was important I learn to protect myself and ‘kick annoying people's ass’.”

Aunt Lemiora raised her eyebrows, looking impressed. “Did you ever travel around with her?”

“Yeah!” Lina’s eyes brightened. “We’d travel during every school break. I’ve seen so many places: America, Brazil, Japan, France, Italy, China, Korea, Egypt, Dubai, Mexico… Mom wanted me to see the world and learn how to survive anywhere. We’d camp, go on hikes, and she’d show me how to find food and water.”

Her family exchanged looks, clearly taken aback. They were beginning to understand just how much her mother had prepared Lina to navigate both the human world and, potentially, this one as well.

As they reached the camp’s edge by the river, they came upon the shrine. The serene, sunlit waters cast a gentle reflection of the statue, giving it an almost ethereal glow against the backdrop of green trees and distant mountains. Her body was adorned with sculpted vines and flowers that wrapped around her like armor, a delicate but fierce crown above her brow, and in her hands, she held a sword and shield.

As they walked past the shrine, Lunira paused, nodding toward the statue. “This is Shalara,” she explained softly. “The Goddess of Warriors’ Fates. She guides the hands of soldiers and blesses those who fight with honor. Warriors pray to her for victory, protection, or, if fate demands it, a swift and honorable death.”

Nearby, a few soldiers knelt respectfully, their weapons’ tips plunged into the sand as they murmured private words to Shalara.

Lathen, intrigued, looked over to Lina. “Do humans have anything like this? Gods they pray to for courage in battle?”

Lina nodded. “Humans have many gods across different religions. But half the world believes in just one God, shared through three main religions.”

Lathen raised his brows. “One God? With three religions?” he repeated, curious. “What’s this God’s name?”

“He doesn’t really have one,” Lina explained thoughtfully. “People just call him ‘God’ or ‘the Lord.’ He’s supposed to be a God of Everything.”

Before anyone could ask Lina more questions, the quiet was broken by a loud rumbling from across the river. The ground trembled beneath their feet as the trees on the far bank shuddered and parted, a massive golden dragon emerging from the shadows of the forest. For such a colossal creature, it moved with an unnerving grace, weaving its way through the trees with ease until it reached the river.

Liriana’s eyes widened as she instinctively grabbed Lina’s arm. “Quickly, come with us, out of his path!” she urged, ushering her granddaughter back from the riverbank. But their escape was cut short as the dragon lowered itself into the river with a splash that sent waves crashing against the shore, soaking everyone nearby. The force of the water knocked Liriana and Lina onto the ground, and as the others moved to help them up, they paused—staring in awe as the dragon loomed directly over them.

The creature was nothing short of breathtaking, with a wingspan nearly a hundred meters across and a length that matched. Its golden scales gleamed in the light, each one reflecting like polished armor. The dragon’s gaze fixed upon Lina, its eyes piercing and intelligent. Its voice rumbled like distant thunder, reverberating in their bones. “There’s a smell here… one I have never encountered before.”

Lathen, the first to regain his composure, stepped forward and addressed the dragon. “Lord Zarageth,” he said with respectful poise, inclining his head. “I am Lathen Sylvanor. We were showing my little cousin here around—she’s new to the realm. I apologize if we disturbed your rest.”

“Sylvanor? The family with the Gift of Language, Yes?”

Lathen bowed his head “Yes, proudly so!”

Lord Zarageth’s molten gaze, however, remained focused on Lina. The dragon lowered his enormous head until Lina could feel his breath—a heat like a blazing forge. His nostrils flared as he took in her scent. “Strange,” he rumbled, his voice low. “Half-elvish… and half… something else.”

Lina swallowed, her voice trembling as she managed to answer. “I’m… half human.”

A look of intrigue sparked in the dragon’s eyes. “Human… I have never smelled one of your kind before… much less tasted.” He drew back slightly, his voice thoughtful. “The race that dwells beyond the portal.” He looked down at her thoughtfully, as if musing over some ancient memory. “Tell me, little one—I've heard rumors of weapons in the human realm. Weapons powerful enough to kill a dragon. Are they true?”

Lathen’s expression grew careful. “The humans possess many powerful weapons, my Lord,” he answered diplomatically. “Though none of us are certain if they could kill a dragon.”

A glint of excitement sparked in Zarageth’s eyes, and he let out a low, rumbling chuckle. “Good. I would hope they could.” He stretched his massive wings, casting a shadow over the entire shrine and riverbank. “A worthy challenge awaits beyond the portal. Perhaps they will give me a glorious battle.”

With a powerful thrust of his wings, he ascended, sending a whirlwind of air and water over the group as he took off into the sky. They watched in silence as his golden form vanished into the clouds, his booming laughter echoing in the distance.

Lunira sank to the ground, her hands trembling as she let out a shaky breath. “That… was terrifying.”

—

The family made their way back to the spot where they’d left Lethira, who leaned casually against the Rivian, arms crossed and a faint smirk on her face. Seeing their wet clothes and slightly frazzled expressions, she raised an eyebrow.

“Did you guys fight a dragon or something?” she quipped.

They all shot her a look. Lemiora shook her head in exasperation. “Actually, we ran into Lord Zarageth.”

Lethira’s face fell, her usual confidence flickering into surprise. “Wait, seriously?” She winced, muttering, “Yeah, that guy’s a jerk.”

“Can we hurry this up?” Lina cut in, placing a hand on her stomach with a dramatic sigh. “I’m starving over here!”

Lethira chuckled and opened the car door, gesturing for them all to pile in. “Alright, alright, little miss human stomach. Let’s get you fed.”

—

In the quiet, sunlit clearing, Lethira rolled her shoulders, sizing up Lina with an amused grin. She flexed her fingers, the padding of her MMA gloves creaking slightly, and settled into a loose stance, her weight balanced. 

“_Lets see if coming to the Prime realm does anything to her_” Lethira thought to herself.

“Alright,” She said, her voice light. “We can call it quits once you’ve landed a hit. Face or chest. Shouldn’t take you too long, right?”

Lina’s expression tightened, her mouth curving into a determined line. She raised her fists, bouncing lightly on the balls of her feet as she studied her mother, searching for an opening. With a sharp intake of breath, she lunged, her fist darting toward Lethira’s face. 

But Lethira sidestepped, brushing Lina’s arm aside with just enough force to guide her off course, not break her flow. 

“Close,” Lethira said, voice tinged with amusement. 

Lina gritted her teeth and reset her stance, the glint in her eyes hardening with resolve. She darted in again, this time with a flurry of punches, each faster than the last. 

Her hands sliced through the air, but Lethira’s movements were impossibly smooth, her forearms deflecting each strike with precision, her body flowing effortlessly out of reach.

Lina huffed with frustration but kept her focus sharp, circling and shifting her weight, every muscle poised. She twisted into another strike, but Lethira’s reflexes were redirecting each attempt with ease, her expression calm, almost bored.

“Come on,” Lethira teased, her voice light but encouraging. “You can do better than that.”

A spark of annoyance flared in Lina’s eyes. She gripped her fists tighter, moving in with newfound intensity. She stepped in close, feinting to the side before aiming a jab at her mother’s midsection. 

Lethira’s hand was there, her fingers deflecting the jab as she shifted her weight, a small smile flickering on her lips.

But Lina wasn’t finished. She pivoted, her elbow darting forward, her body twisting in one seamless movement as she tried to catch Lethira off-guard. 

Lethira’s expression flickered with brief surprise, she blocked the blow, her fingers barely making contact with Lina’s arm as she redirected her momentum once again.

“Almost,” Lethira murmured, a playful glint in her eyes.

Lina felt her heart pounding, her frustration building with each miss, her movements growing faster, her strikes more relentless.

And yet, her mother’s defenses held—deftly evading, deflecting, and blocking.

Lina’s eyes narrowed, her breaths coming in sharp, quick bursts as she pressed forward with relentless energy. She could feel her frustration building, pushing her to attack faster, her strikes coming harder with each attempt. Her mother moved around her with ease. Every strike meeting air or nudged aside.

“Still not enough?” Lina muttered, gritting her teeth as she launched herself forward, her movements growing wild with the need to land just one blow. She angled in, darting low with a swift jab, then twisting mid-movement, aiming for her mother’s side. But again, Lethira evaded, barely moving more than necessary, a calm smile playing on her lips.

“You’re getting faster,” Lethira observed, still deflecting with smooth, practiced motions, her gaze keen as she sized up her daughter’s growing ferocity.

Lina didn’t hear her mother’s words over the rush of her heartbeat, the thrill and frustration mixing with a fire she could feel spreading through her limbs. Her movements became sharper, her feet lighter, each strike whipping through the air as though guided by something more than mere muscle. She stepped forward again, and this time, she almost saw her mother’s mask of composure slip, just a hint of surprise flashing across Lethira’s face.

“Yes!” Lina lunged with renewed determination, pressing her advantage. 

But in her haste, her punches grew wilder, almost too fast to control. She threw a jab and then a follow-up, and her fist seemed to light up with heat, her whole body tingling as if it were suddenly too charged. Without warning, she saw a flash— her fist glowing hot in an instant.

In the next heartbeat, a burst of light and heat erupted from her fist, launching forward in a blinding arc. 

Lethira’s eyes widened as she twisted aside, barely escaping as the fireball shot past her, igniting the tree directly behind. It roared to life in an explosion of flames, embers showering down as the blaze caught and spread across its branches.

Both of them froze, eyes locked wide as they looked from each other to the burning tree. The clearing was silent save for the crackling of flames licking at the bark, filling the air with a smoky, scorching smell.

Lina’s voice was barely a whisper, the realization of what she’d done sinking in. “Heiligen scheiße.”

“Well, that answers that question,” Lethira commented while watching the burning tree.

As Lethira and Lina stared at the smoldering tree, trying to process what had just happened, the crunch of boots over twigs drew their attention. An Orc soldier, clad in their family’s insignia, emerged from the edge of the clearing, his gaze steady and posture tense.

“Lady Lethira,” he said, inclining his head in respect. “Your family has requested your presence at their tent. It’s urgent.”

Lethira exchanged a quick glance with Lina, her eyebrows raised in curiosity. “Urgent, huh?” She let out a small sigh, rolling her shoulders to shake off the tension of their sparring session.

“Could you find someone to handle this?” She gestured to the still-burning tree, the flames casting flickering shadows across the clearing. “And… maybe keep this between us? No need to mention we were here.”

The Orc gave a nod, his gaze shifting momentarily to the tree before he turned and strode back toward the camp. Lethira placed a hand on Lina’s shoulder, giving it a reassuring squeeze. “Let’s go see what this is all about,” she murmured, her voice light but laced with curiosity.

—

Lethira had dismissed Lina to the RV, not wanting her to be in the middle of whatever was about to happen.

Inside the Sylvanor family tent, grief and frustration hung thick in the air. Lemiora clung tightly to her son, Lathen, as if trying to shield him from the reality they all now faced. Her face was pale, and her hands trembled as she held onto him. Across the tent, Liriana clutched her husband, her expression a mix of fear and disbelief, while Lunira clung to her brother, her voice choked with a sob.

“The Emperor is a madman!” she cried, burying her face against Lathen’s shoulder. Her words echoed in the tense silence.

Luridar cleared his throat, his voice heavy as he addressed Lethira. “He’s dismissed all who spoke out against the invasion—replaced them with Hardline Loyalists.”

Ghorak’s voice rumbled low, his usually steady gaze shadowed with worry. “And he’s given the order to begin tomorrow morning. There’s no more time, Lethira.”

Lethira’s jaw tightened. “What the fuck!? This is insane! It’s suicide!”

Luridar’s eyes softened for a brief moment, but he spoke with a controlled firmness. “Our family’s Gift of Language is deemed necessary for communicating with the humans. Lathen and I are required to… ‘negotiate’ their submission.”

“No,” Lethira shot back, her voice sharp, anger coloring her tone. “It’s madness. You should refuse. There’s no sense in risking your lives for his bullshit!”

Luridar’s hand clenched at his side, his voice thick with barely contained emotion as he faced his daughter. “If we lose our lands, our titles, everything we’ve built for generations. They’ll install some hardliner in our place—someone who’ll turn our home into a nightmare for everyone we’ve protected.”

Lethira’s fists clenched as a surge of fury swept through her, sparks of blue energy crackling over her knuckles. She turned without another word, ignoring the pleas of her family as she strode out of the tent. 

Rage pulsed through her, barely restrained as she walked, her fists still sparking as she headed toward the Emperor’s camp, as the storm brewing inside her.

Hi! I am looking primarily for friendship, potentially open to more if it occurs naturally, but not searching for anything more specifically. 

A bit about the type of person I’m looking for: 
I live in western Canada, so a similar time zone to that would be ideal(exact same time zone not necessary, any North American time zone is close enough). I am looking for someone aged 30+(this is a hard boundary). Does not expect constant/instant replies. I would like there to be daily communication, but I’m not constantly glued to my phone. I am looking for someone that is willing and able to put effort into conversation(I will do the same). I am looking for someone kind, fun, maybe a little bit funny, and genuine. Other than that, I’m very open to most other things and am not looking for a specific “type” of person! I’m looking for friendship first and foremost, but wouldn’t be opposed to it if the friendship evolved into something a bit more flirty/feelings develop. That being said, I’m not *looking* for something serious, nor do I have any intention of relocating or anything like that. 



A bit about me/some general interests: 

I love to listen to music, my favorite band since I was 15 lol is Blink 182(have seen them live three times). I like to watch movies and tv shows(who doesn’t?) - I’m definitely a horror girly, but I like other things too! I love to shop and get my nails done. I’m a little obsessed with Jellycats. Also a little obsessed with Bobs Burgers.  I love coffee. I’m very close with my family, we spend a lot of time together. I like to try and stay active, and get at least a bit of exercise daily. 
Here are a couple photos of me https://imgur.com/a/5P3SHJq


If you think this sounds like something you’d be interested in, please contact me(chat preferred over DM). Please only message me if you are going to include some context - tell me about yourself, start a conversation based on something I’ve mentioned in my post, it’s up to you but I will likely not spend any effort on “hey” or smalltalk responses.

Let's be honest, everywhere has there dumb population of people yet not everywhere has these labels. As for the beginning example the warning was put there as a way to protect companies from being sued by negligent and careless customers. This warning started with an elderly woman who spilt coffee on herself and received significant burns to her groin area, normally this would be just seen as a careless accident but she was able to sue McDonald for a large sum of money. This has led the way for others to find ways to sue companies for simingly insignificant things and could be avoided by using common sense, but in this case people are weaponizing incompetence to sue. It's getting to a point where the wording on signs has to be very specific. For example, where I live you cannot have signs on your property that say “Beware of dog” as this can now be interpreted that you know you have a violent dog and if someone comes on your property and gets attacked then the property owner can get sued. For this reason we have signs that say “No trespassing, dogs on premises”, this way we are not liable since we aren't specifically stating that the dogs will “attack” aka defend our home.

1ghb22h,https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/1ghb22h/car_driver_behavior_outside_of_the_car/,Car driver behavior outside of the car,"Something I notice from people who drive everywhere is they also tend to lack social skills and the awareness of how their actions impact others. 

I think of this because this morning I was walking out the door of a cafe with a coffee in one hand and a sandwich in the other. I was using my elbow to open the door so I was doing so pretty slowly. Instead of just walking through the door and letting the door fall off my elbow into the person potentially behind me, I turned around to check and see if someone was there. To my surprise there was a woman standing maybe 1 inch behind me, all but shoving me out of the way. She didn't acknowledge me or that she was being rude, she just waited until I moved just far enough through the door that she could squeeze in behind me. She never reached to help me hold the door even though her hands were empty. She walked through the door right passed me as if it was a given that I'd hold the door for her. She must have realized she was being rude because she sorta turned around and gave me a weird half-assed thank you. Then she hopped in her car and drove off. 

This alone isn't an indication that car drivers behave rudely around others, but I have had similarly anti-social experiences at this cafe many times and I think it is because all the people who come to it drive here from other neighborhoods. I have a way better experience at the cafe across the street where it seems almost everyone who walks through the doors is walking their dog or is friendly with the baristas (indicating that they are regulars and probably live nearby). 

My mom always told me growing up that using cars turns even the nicest people evil, citing road rage as the strongest example. I think its even worse than that. It's a well known phenomenon that because you can't really see the human in the driver seat of another car, drivers are more likely to act narcissistically. I'm starting to feel that with enough car uses, drivers bring this behavior out of the car and into face to face interaction. 

In a similar vein, I've heard people say that in Europe people express themselves with their outfits because everyone walks while in America people express themselves with their cars because everyone drivers. I don't know how true this is, but it makes sense to me that if all your social interactions happen through the medium of driver to driver interaction, you will bring that mentality into your face to face ones. Similarly, I find that people who walk and use public transport everywhere, people who live in cities most of their lives, and people who engage in communities at third-places tend to always have better social skills than people who do not. We expect that someone who is isolated in their basement playing video games all day would lack social skills, and I think the same can be said for those who spend all their time isolated behind the steering wheel. 

On yet a third similar note, In Death and Life of Great American Cities, Jane Jacobs talks about how transplants (people who come into a city to live for only a short time before moving away) tend to have less responsibility and ownership for the spaces they occupy and drain the culture from the city. I think this happens on a smaller scale when the majority of a the patrons of business drive to get there. you just get a different social experience as a result. They don't have ownership of it and they don't care to be friendly with the others there. Car culture trains drivers to see everything as an obstacle slowing them down and preventing them from getting what they came for as fast as possible. I imagine this is only amplified by suburbanites who drive into the city from other towns (i.e., the extreme example being the conservatives that are scared of the city and treat the local pedestrians like the enemy).

Walking to your destination on the other hand has the opposite effect. It calms you down. Its meditative. If you spend 15 min walking somewhere and know you've got a 15 min walk home, whats an extra 5 minutes waiting in line? Let alone, an extra 2 seconds to hold the door open for someone. If you take your time getting somewhere, it becomes more ok to take your time being there. If you take in your surroundings on the walk there, you may also want to take in your surroundings there, which may include engaging with the employees or other customers. 

I am by no means saying that all people who drive to get to their destination are bad people and are incapable of holding the door open for their peers or making friends with others sharing the space they occupy. But I am saying that I have a strong reason to believe that using a car entrains certain anti-social behaviors into people and walking / sharing a bus with others entrains certain pro-social ones. I don't think this mental model generalizes to all car drivers, but I think it is a good theory to explain certain types of undesirable behaviors in people you might interact with.

I commissioned a new artist (no portfolio, contract, etc) to design the bag art for a coffee company I started earlier this year. I took a risk on them, given no background, but was happy with the result. Fast forward to now, they are asking if they can sell prints, presumedly without my business logo. I hate saying no to a fresh artists, but at the same time, feel a little weird about commissioning something specifically for my business, only for it to be used for their personal gain now that it was funded. I paid a few hundred dollars, so it's not like it was a freebie. Am I the bad guy in this situation or is that standard? To make it more awkward, part of the request was to hang prints in the cafe she works in, which feels like a conflict of interest. The artist is young, so I don't think there is any bad intention, but maybe just inexperience. Thanks for any advice!

   back in march i started having bad reactions every time i ate , i thought i was going to die. my breathing became difficult, i thought my heart an or lungs were  going to stop. i still dont know exactly how to explain it.  it wasnt palpitations, i had those going into keto and, what i suspect, as candida die off. 

   i went back on the keto diet in February  , at one point i drank a half of cup of kefir after dinner and had a horrible reaction. i was regularly eating home made 24 hour yogurt but this was only probably the 2-3rd time in my life drinking kefir.  i only had half a serving because it is 9g carbs per cup.    that night i thought i was having a heart attack.  i was terrified.  after researching if kefir was keto friendly i came across candida die off and figured that's what had happened.   ive had these strands in my stool for years that i thought at times were parasites. and i guess i was right because candida surely can become a parasite (maybe SIBO?)  

i was always hungry before doing keto. i would eat all day.  my health was always neglected by doctors because i am their ""mentally ill"" cash cow. easy money.  i told them i thought i had diabetes and they laughed.   so i bought a tester and i turns out i do have pre diabetes or insulin resistance. right before i started carnivore i had my lowest reading of 97.  ive only tested once since starting carnivore and it was 103. id probably test more often if i had a lancet, im using a sewing needle. but i feel a lot better and am not hungry all the time so i don't really care about that.

  
after starting carnivore in may i felt instantly better.  i read about the diet on keto and candida  forums but i thought it sounded idiotic. i assumed you were all lying or brainwashed :)  you cant possibly get all your nutrition from meat!  then one day i happened to just have beef for breakfast and i didnt have any symptoms. had a salad for dinner symptoms returned. so i weened myself off of vegetables and plants in disbelief as my pantry variety diminished.  

oxalates seem to really disagree with me, ive tried reintroducing a few things and almonds were the worst, instant death.   and my breath tasted like sewage.   My mental health was better that it has been in years. and the alergic reaction i was having to food went down about 90% at least.  sometimes  beef would cause problems, mostly if it was ground.  the only other foods ive tried were pumpkin seeds i had from before starting the diet and a few limes, but im going to force myself to eat some liver again for vitamin c. i also tried bacon and eggs but i dont think those agree with me either. 

my progress  seems to have stalled though and i think it has to do with mold in my house.  im going to get back into just beef and salt and try taking iodine.  i dont know if kefir is okay though

  
i read that casein feeds candida. a few months ago, after 4 months strict carnivore (mostly lion) + coffee some of the time i bought some cheese, seemed okay, three days later i bought some kefir and i felt even better. a few days later i bought pasture raised cream and grass fed butter. i tried to make crem fresh/ sour cream  but the kefir from the farmers market fermented the cream faster than i anticipated and it tasted of alcohol.  i drank a few ml of cream in my coffee, and started getting bad anxiety again . ended up throwing it away, barely used any of it.  my mental health issues came back at the same time did the candida strands in my stool.    so i am hesitant to try kefir again.  thanks for reading if you made it this far.

27, F

I’ve had to move back home because my tenancy agreement ended and I’m in the process of buying a house. I had to bring my cat with me (who uses a human toilet, so no litter)

Currently at home are my two parents, and older brother

- my older brother is unemployed
- I’m the middle child

Okay, AITA:

- we have two showers, one new one and one really really old moldy one. My mum and my brother use the new one. I’m not allowed to use this one (my brother banned me because all his expensive products are there (and I guess he thinks I’ll use them, idk) and my parents don’t conflict with my bro at all) I have to shower only when/if he leaves the house as the moldy old shower makes my scalp itch. Sometimes I go days without showering because he doesn’t leave the house. When he does leave the house my mum hurries me in the shower and then goes in and wipes the surfaces so he doesn’t know I used it 

- my mum buys my brother an entire pineapple, apple and carrots every single day (he juices fresh juice daily, which he shares with to my parents). I’ve never been offered this (nor am I particularly interested). My parents then hand wash his (very complicated to wash) juicer. My parents don’t buy me any groceries (not even coffee, I buy my own groceries down to soap etc)- when we eat out, it’s automatically expected that I’d pay for everybody (which I do), and then my mum pays for a takeaway for my brother (like bruh instead of getting a takeaway for him pay for your share??). Like everytime we go out for coffee, food, anything, it’s automatically assumed I pay for everybody (which I do)

- I needed to stay the night at my younger sister’s (she lives close to my work) and my sis and had an argument (neither of my parents were there). I really wanted to shower at her house but I ended up booking a hotel for the night as the argument got really bad. When I came home my parents didn’t speak to me for a week because we argued (they took her side even though they weren’t there, I told them you don’t have to be on my side I didn’t ask you to be on my side, but you don’t have to *automatically* assume I’m wrong either). My parents screamed at me almost daily for this.

- I’m a huge people pleaser, and I’m constantly spending loads and loads of money to please my parents and sister (I bought all their phones all new iPhones etc)

- I’m not allowed to even let my cat roam around the house, so he stays in my bedroom and I pick him up, take him to the toilet, take him back to my bedroom. Poor little guy meows at my bedroom door constantly throughout the night and I can’t open the door for him

- every week my mum is like have you heard from the solicitor, when are you moving etc (she really didn’t want me to move back home either)

- my mum makes dinner for my dad and a special (gluten free, seed oil free etc) dinner for my brother, and nothing for me. I run out daily to the grocery shop to buy a ready meal everyday

Me being back home has made me feel like a black sheep. Nobody (not my sister or my bro) put in 5% the effort I put in, and yet I feel so isolated, alone? I feel turned off from even talking to my sister (we were close friends before I moved back home). Something about seeing a bag full of fresh fruit, and not even a penny for me really irritates me - am I just an entitled brat?

1ghal17,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1ghal17/tips_i_would_offer_when_using_google_maps_to/,Tips I would offer when using Google Maps to navigate in Japan,"Google Maps is a fantastic app that I used extensively while traveling through Japan. It was quite indispensable and worked well for the most part.

Most of us are familiar with the app, use it for driving directions, etc... but there are some nuances when using it for public transportation that I thought would be helpful for others to be aware of.

* It is a good idea to familiarize yourself with Google maps before you head to Japan. You might want to watch some videos on Youtube, specifically as it relates to using Google Maps to navigate the public transit system.
* Google  maps may not differentiate between routes it is suggesting that require extra $$ or reserved seats (like shinkansen, express buses, etc). and those that you can just use your SUICA card to navigate. For example, upon exiting Narita Airport... Google maps might tell you to take Skyline, or the Airport Limo Bus, which might require you to purchase reservations, and then provide you with the remainder of the transfers you need to take to reach your destinations, all of which can be accessed via SUICA through normal transit options.
* Carefully examine the route options Google Maps is offering. It may suggest a Shinkansen, express train, etc. when that is not necessary, and you may incur extra expenses when using these options. It may not offer the fastest or most convenient route first... review the different options it gives you... don't just pick the first one on the list. For example... if you are headed to Mount Fuji or to Nikko for the day.. Google maps might initially suggest the limited express train or an express bus. Both options will require reservations, and there may be significantly delays waiting at the terminal until your scheduled departure time. In both situations, you could alternatively take a normal train... you might be standing.. it might take longer in transit.. but you could still arrive at your destination faster, if you consider how long you might wait at the terminal for a scheduled reservation.
* Compare walking directions to public transit directions... You might find that it takes roughly the same time to walk as it would to take public transit. I often elected to walk a mile or so,  rather than take public transit. It was a great way to stumble upon local shrines, stores, eateries, etc, and just see parts of life in Japan outside the typically tourist areas. One of my favorite parts of my trip, was a sunset walk like this were I walked along a river, and stumbled up a local ""movie night at the park"" where street food vendors and musicians were available... and families were spread out on the grass having picnics in the park. Walking directions might have you walking through parks, etc.. which could be completely different than using the google maps settings for driving directions, that might be longer and route you around these areas. 
* Google maps may not work as well underground due to lack of GPS. I have also found this true when sitting on trains away from the windows.  It may not show you the correct station that you are at, it may not show you exactly which station you are at... You might not see your accurate GPS position until exiting the station. It is really important to pay attention to the directions Google maps is offering. You will know which station you need to exit at... even if Google maps is still showing you sitting at your first station after you have already arrived at your destination station. I had situations where it failed to update until I had made transfers to a different train and finally exited the station.
* When Google maps is working, it will give you a ""count down"". sometimes this is just an estimate of where you should be... and how long it should take before you get off. ""3 stops"" means you get off at the third stop. This is helpful to conserve battery if you are riding ""17 stops"" or sitting on a bus for a while, You can turn your phone screen off for a while. On longer legs where I can sit down on a train or bus... I often use this time to plug my phone into my travel battery and recharge a bit as well... I still pay attention, especially as I get closer to my intended exit.
* Train lines are color coded, red, blue, yellow, green, etc. There may be an alpha numeric code for the train line and station, platform numbers may be listed to show you exactly which platform you need to be on to assure you are traveling in the right direction. Alpha numeric codes are very helpful (""take TX7 to TX-12"") but outside Tokyo, the alpha numeric codes are not as consistently reported on Google maps... So you really have to pay more attention the station names, etc.
* Google maps is great at telling you which exit to take at a station ""Follow signs to West Exit and exit at A2"". Unfortunately stations can still be a bit confusing. For example... upon exiting the train... you might not see signs for a ""west exit"". You might have to follow signs for the north exit before finding sights for the west exit. Due to construction at various stations, navigation signs might be missing or difficult to follow. There were situations where I went up stairs upon exiting a train... and realized I was in a section of the station not connected to the area I wanted to exit at... I ended up having to back track, down the stairs... walk on the platform for a while until I came to the escalators, and then I was at the part of the station I needed to be in to find the right exit. In addition to Google maps, There are maps in the station that can help you see where you are at, and how to navigate to where you need to be. There are also helpful station agents at each ticket gate, that can point you in the right direction. While some speak excellent English, many don't... but they will often have laminated maps, and directions printed out in English that can be helpful to follow in the trickier stations... they probably get the same question in English a hundred times a day!
* Speaking of confusing... upon transferring trains... Google maps might say ""walk five minutes transfer to the AY line"". You might be walking through the station... with no navigation sights pointing to the AY line. Keep in mind that you may need to actually exit the station, and walk  a few blocks on the street, before entering a separate station for the ""AY line"". Again... you can ask a station agent if you are unclear.
* Google maps offers ""Time bound"" routing. For example... if you leave your hotel in the morning it might advise you to ""take bus 232 at 8:35am"" or ""take the P line from platform 10 at 8:55am"". If you stop for coffee, at a conbini, etc... or you are just slow because you are unfamiliar with the area, it is a good idea to refresh the directions as they may have changed. after 8:45am,  ""City bus 35"" might be the fastest bus based on the schedule.. the next ""bus 232"" might not be back around for a while if you just missed it. If the P Line already left platform 10 at 8:55... the next train might be departing from Platform 8 or 9 at 9:05 or 9:15. I found this especially true outside of Tokyo.
* Trains run on time in Japan as a general rule... 4 minutes early? it might be a different train. 4 minutes late to the station? you might need to take a different train at a different platform. Google maps will show you various options and when the trains/buses are scheduled to depart so you can update your routing directions on the fly.
* Pay attention to what the locals are doing. Different trains require you to line up at different points on the platform. Some train cars are ""women only"", but only during rush hour in the am... in other parts of Japan, trains might have ""women only"" cars all day long. Sometimes there are painted lines on the platform, indicating where to line up for a specific train. On platforms where multiple trains are passing through with multiple destinations, there is often a screen on the platform showing the next few trains to arrive.
* If you are the navigator for your group and using an ESIM, pay attention to how much data you are using... and how much battery life you have left.  Also bring along an extra battery/charging cable for your phone. Between navigating and using my phone for pictures, google translate, checking my itinerary, etc... I burned thorough both data and through battery power fairly quicky... as my screen was almost always on, sometimes unintentionally, if I left the camera on when I put the phone back in my pocket.  GPS and navigation apps are notorious for depleting your battery quickly.
* Don't worry if you accidently jump on the wrong train or head in the wrong direction. You aren't the first tourist to do so, you wont be the last. Typically, it is a pretty easy fix to jump off at the next station and recalibrate. Accidently jump on an express train that requires an extra fee? The conductor can help you sort it out.. no big deal.

Well, those are my tips, hopefully you found some of these helpful. If you have any questions to ask or any tips you would add on your own, please feel free to do so.",19,1730481255.0,JapanTravelTips,22,0.88,False

>The business’ three-year lease was up on Nov. 1, and the new terms were served at the start of the minimum 15-day notice period required by state law. Matkins and Manhart said they were surprised by their landlord’s proposal, which included a 150% increase in rent and other contingencies the business owners thought were “unusual.”

>The rent rose from $18 per square foot in 2021 to $25, and the lease asked for Lucky Ones Coffee to sign a personal guarantee and pay for any work that might need to be done in the building such as a new HVAC system, according to Manhart. 

Lucky Ones coffee is part of a non-profit organization with a mission of providing job opportunities for individuals with disabilities.  They currently operate two locations (Park City Library and Kamas), and are in the process of opening up a third location at a city library in the Marmalade district.

As I've gotten older, a good, convenient coffee place has become a more and more important part of my life.  Just something about getting a fresh coffee and pastry to start the day just makes me joyous.  The Park City library location came in really handy last winter, as my toddler and I were both on the struggle bus, and a quick fix from the Lucky Ones location there made us both happy.

It seems like non-profits running coffee shops has been a trend.  Good to see, in that it's always good to see a non-profit succeed in it's mission.  Still though, troubling to see an economic environment where the only way to make a coffee shop feasible is by it running it as a non-profit.

You read these kinds of articles, and it's tempting to immediately see the landlord as the bad guy (and the article does seem to be biased that way).

At the same time, it cites a ""150% increase in rent,"" then elsewhere talks about going from $18/sq ft to $25 a sq/ft.  That's a $7/sq ft increase, which by my math is a 39% increase.  Still a lot, but that doesn't seem to be wholly out of line, given the inflation of the past several years.

The aspect of paying for any needed work definitely seems more suspect.  Ultimately, I assume the landlord has  a line on getting a more profitable tenant in there.

Bad on both parties for running the lease negotiations down to the wire.  It seems like any kind of negotiations should have occurred long before the lease expiration.  Although, easy for me to say as a non-business owner, sitting here behind my keyboard.

Sad to see Lucky Ones close this location, but encouraged that they're opening up a second location in the Marmalade district.  Maybe the model of co-locating in libraries is the only way to make that business model work.",4,1730480976.0,ParkCity,1,1.0,False

I love the look of the Ascasco and I love the idea of the thermoblock system. 

I’m coming from a delonghi dedica, which has been great for a couple of months but I’ve progressed quicker thanking ever imagined.  Temperature stability is importing to me and the ability to steam milk also. 

My wife and I start the day with a cup of moccamaster filtered coffee, I’ll move onto a double shot around 10am, then sneak a flat white in right before lunch and then make my wife and I  cappuccino‘s before heading out to work. 

I feel the Ascaso will be able to deal extremely well with the amount of shots on the day, maybe even overkill. 
We have friends round a bit but never dinner parties that requires 10 people having an espresso, it’s usually beers and wine 😉

But yeah, what’s your experience with either the duo or uno? Really excited to hear your thoughts.

There's this boy I've met on tinder at first I really didn't think much of it but I was talking to him as a friend we'll call him (Mario M 25), Mario  is a foreign he's Chinese , when first I started talking it was something normal chatting through the day sharing details about our lives
Then slowly it became a habit we used texting for 2 weeks then we started using phone calls until he suggested that we meet and I was happy because I really felt that there was chemistry between us we fixed the date everything was going fine I've showered get dressed he texted me at the morning about how excited he is and I wouldn't lie I was excited and scared he told that they call him from work and called him in the office but he'll manage to finish before our date the time came and I went out to my surprise they didn't let him leave so he was apologizing and insisted that I find a place to stay until he picks me up and that what happened and in that night I had the best date of my life everything was going so smoothly we were flirty we held hands, he gave the jacket because it was too cold , we had so much fun then he drove me home then left we chatted over the text we were both happy and tomorrow morning he insisted that we spend the day together and that's exactly what happened we went to a coffee and stayed together he had to work on a few things and we discussed some importants matters
Later as always he drove me home safely and left. Then we planned another date but he was so tired so we changed the plans and went to his place we stayed there we watched the tv and it was a perfect time and he was so gentle and caring he didn't force himself or anything we listened to music then had a lil walk before he drove me home .
Then I started to feel that he's a lil busy he said that he's busy with packing since he has to change the place he used to stay at , and I'm a person who has bad anxiety so my mind kept on making stories so I took a decision to surprise him with some homemade food since I've had the idea that he was busy and wouldn't have time to cook he was happy with the food and kept the note I wrote with him even after he moved out he told it meant so much to him to ""us"" and we secluded another date we went to try new food and then we went to an amusement park it was all fun 
After that night we kept on texting but he was a lil off he told that he has so many thoughts going about his work job and life and that he's stressed and he started avoiding planing dates he said that he needs sometime and we continued texting normally it's just that I don't understand and I don't know what to do I don't want to be pushy and make him feel uncomfortable 
But I'm lost and scared because he was nothing but nice to me and caring

1ghaagt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bushwick/comments/1ghaagt/is_cilantro_club_cooked/,is cilantro club cooked?,"hey y'all. so i found out about this cafe cilantro club from this reddit page a few months ago. wild business model, runs on a subscription so you pay a $9 flat fee and get the food and stuff at cost. and at the start of the summer the food and coffee were great, friendly and quick service, simple healthy food. sounded like a pretty cool idea, but I figured it was too good to be true and so did a lot of other people in the thread. well, I'm afraid me and the other skeptics might have been right. 

recently the energy has been different there, right? I'm pretty sure the one blonde barista quit (good for her, she was nice but she looked like she was constantly overwhelmed) and from what i can tell they haven't hired anyone new. and they were already understaffed! since then, it's honestly been pretty abysmal. coffee is still alright (the other baristas aren't as friendly but they're good), but the food has gotten so much worse. seems like its been getting worse for a while (switching the sandwich bread, inconsistent and unpredictable menu) but they took my favorite item off the menu (ham and cheese croissant), at first serving them grossly cold, and then replacing them completely with some cheap pre-made thing. all the other sandwiches taste like gas station fare. I see the owner back there making them now (because they're understaffed) and he obviously has no food service experience. never wears a hat or gloves. and he's constantly arguing with his staff and customers. makes the vibe in there terrible. and he's bad at pitching his business to new customers so when a new customer is there when you're waiting for your pickup order it makes the whole process take longer. especially when they don't get the business model and you can see him getting frustrated trying to explain it. which is a super fun vibe when you're just like...... standing to the side waiting for your latte. plus, they raised the prices, changed to pickup only, and started taking more and more stuff off the menu. 

anyway I feel like this place has got to be closing soon. when I've talked to the owner before he seemed nice enough, but kinda clueless. he said they opened in February and to be honest I can't see them resigning the lease there. it seems like he's scrambling to make it work and its just making the business worse. and no replacement for the barista who quit means he's running out of money. sorry to say, but I think cilantro club is cooked. hopefully it survives the winter, but I doubt it'll last past January. I already unsubscribed just because the food and vibe has been so bad, but if you're still into it I say get it while you can. the summer of cilantro is over. it's like moviepass all over again 😭😭😭",7,1730480489.0,Bushwick,3,1.0,False

I asked one of the employees why they moved and she said, we told the owners it was too busy at the Stark location and we were going to revolt unless they moved back where it wasn’t so busy. Now, I noticed they have Fall/Winter hours where they’re only open Friday-Sunday. Does anyone know what is going on? It seemed like a thriving business and selfishly I loved going there.

40f dating 52M for ~5 months. Very happy and things are going well. I can see myself falling in love with him. 

He’s separated from his ex (not divorced yet) and they had 3 dogs together. Ex wife basically abandoned the dogs and my BF takes care of all 3. One recently had a serious surgery and has needed more attention bc she can’t walk. 

BF lives in another city and we see each other once a week if lucky. He works extremely hard, long hours, because he’s saving for a new house (gave his old house to his ex when they separated)

The little free time he has, he takes the dogs on long walks, feeds them homemade meals, and he goes to the gym. Then back to work. 

Sometimes, like today, he travels to my city to run errands. I asked him today if he wanted to swing by after his errand. Wasn’t expecting much of his time since I work during the day, but a quick kiss, hello, or coffee would’ve been nice. 

I already knew the answer would be no bc he has to go take care of the dogs. 

Now let me preface this. I love dogs. Grew up with dogs. Adore them. But, I chose to not have pets bc I haven’t been in a place to plant roots, settle down (I rent, don’t own a home, and travel a lot). His story is obv different coming off a 14yr marriage. So I get it. 

But my issue is I kinda resent the dogs. Better put, im jealous of them. They get all his time and attention and he can’t even swing by my place for a kiss bc of the dogs. 

Am I wrong to be debating whether this could work longterm given his commitment to the dogs? I’m not saying he should give them up or anything. And I’d never ask him to. 

I just don’t know how this can work longterm if I’m always in 4th place. The 3 dogs are always his priority. 

I love dogs. But I also love myself. I respect his situation, and, maybe im allowed to not want that situation for myself.

=================

New York was different.

It was different to Eddie.

That was a stupid statement, obviously the city he had been away from for years was different than he remembered. Yet there was something beyond the mere passage of time at play here. Something fundamental had been altered in his time away. It was not in the place or the air but the people themselves. The way the average New Yorker acted was different now.

People were much friendlier than before, strangers took long moments of conversation where details normally deeply hidden were given freely. No one seemed to get irritated or angry about the normal inconveniences of life.

It was strange to Eddie.

Of course, maybe that was just because he wasn't there. He wasn't there when the biggest gang war in history broke, ravaging the city and killing hundreds if not thousands in the process. Perhaps he had missed out on acquiring this new social connective tissue. Maybe that is why if you stopped Eddie, right here on the sidewalk where he was walking, and asked him what he thought about all this, he would say it was nothing but a fiction.

This wasn't a true community.

This wasn't true togetherness.

This wasn't true bonding.

This was fear, masquerading in the disguise of positivity. Nobody wanted to know thy neighbor. Everyone just wanted to stop themselves from falling into the void, even if they had to grab on to the unknown right next to them to do it.

Of course maybe Eddie was just being cynical about it all.

Stepping off the sidewalk, Eddie went up the stairs to the entrance of the LIFE Foundation public headquarters, the automated glass doors opening up and allowing Eddie inside.

“Eddie!” Richard, leaning against the lobby receptionist's desk, waved.

“Have you just been standing there waiting for me?” Eddie asked.

“No, I was making conversation while I waited,” Richard said.

“You certainly were,” The receptionist said in a strained voice, a vein threatening to pop out of her forehead.

“You seriously had nothing better to do?” Richard pushed off the desk and started walking, Eddie following after him as he went down a staff only hallway.

“Hey, you know what they say, the work day doesn't start til Eddie gets here.” Eddie gave his coworker a look.

“Who are they?”

“Me, I'm them.”

Eddie rolled his eyes.

“Plus, it's not like I actually had anything to do, I didn't get a morning patrol and the staff meeting isn't gonna start for another ten minutes.” Eddie chuckled and Richard gave him the side eye.

“What's funny?”

“Well, I might not know what they say but I do know what Treece says, ten minutes early is on time and on time is late.” Richard let out an irritated groan and rolled his eyes.

“Don't remind me of that man,” Richard whined. “Dude acts like this is a military unit, he wasn't ever even in the military, we were!”

Eddie just gave an amused smile and turned into the break room, only to be grabbed and pulled out by Richard.

“What the hell are you doing?” Eddie asked.

“We can't go in there.”

“Why?”

“Because Donna is in there and I still owe her for covering my last sick day.”

“First off,” Eddie peeled Richard's hands off him. “Don't touch me. Second, why are you afraid of giving what you owe?”

“Because! I got a vacation planned and if I give what I owe, I know she's going to pick me to cover a day right in the middle of that vacation time. I know it”

Eddie took a deep breath.

“Richard, I really want a cup of coffee right now so I'm going to go grab a cup of coffee, don't not grab me again please.” Richard backed up.

“Okay man, just… if she asks where I am, don't tell her.”

“I don't have to ask him when I can hear talking.” Donna Diego walked out of the break room, holding two cups of coffee. She handed one off to Eddie, who gladly accepted it.

Richard backed up some more.

“Donna! Hi!” Richard greeted. “How are you doing this beautiful morning?”

“I'm great, just thinking about when I want a day off.” Donna walked past both Eddie and Richard. “I'll tell you after the meeting, come on.”

“We still have time before the meeting, I don't get why both of you are in a rush,” Richard complained as he and Eddie followed Donna.

“Well, you know what Treece says, ten minutes early is on time and on time is late.” Richard looked like he wanted to scream but kept it quiet.

The trio quickly arrived at Treece's office. Stepping in, they found him casually typing away on his computer. He didn't acknowledge their arrival until a good few moments after.

“You're all here, good.” Treece stood from behind his desk. “Now, I'm unsure of how many of you follow the company calendar but I'm sure all of you have heard the buzzing of our annual company gala tonight.”

Eddie had indeed heard the buzzing, coworkers gossiping about it and what not, but the buzzing was pretty useless to him since he did keep up with the company calendar. Every year the LIFE Foundation would hold a gala at its New York building. Publicly it was just a show of good faith, an open door event where even regular members of the public could attend as long as they were in dress code. Pragmatically and internally, it was meant to show off the health of the company's income and make nice with potential investors.

“This gala is important, New York's elite will be in attendance and of course, our CEO as well,” Treece continued. “As such, it is of the utmost importance that our security for this event be air tight, hence why I'm appointing you three as security heads.”

Eddie raised his eyebrow and Richard raised his hand. 

“Yes, Mr Rivera?” Treece asked.

 “I don't wanna sound unappreciative of this opportunity but I have to ask, why are we being picked?” Richard asked.

“Well simply put, besides myself, you three are the best on staff. You three are the only ones on this building's staff that are pulled from post-military service, everyone else is from our internal company training service,” Treece explained. “And I don't want to sound disparaging of our company's efforts but the internal service is hardly well crafted.”

“Sounds good to me,” Donna said, seemingly excited by the job. “What are we handling?”

“You'll each be assigned your own section.” Treece pulled a selection of files from his desk, handing one out each to Eddie, Richard, and Donna. “Donna, you'll be in charge of coordinating and securing the front entrance as well as screening guests. Richard, you'll be taking charge of the back staff areas like the kitchen and maintenance halls. Eddie, you'll be taking the main floor.”

Although theoretically it was the best section to take, Eddie couldn't help but feel a pit in his stomach. The idea of being smack dab in the middle of the drunken masses gave him a headache and having to deal with whatever petty problems they would have gave him another headache on top of the first one. Before Eddie could speak up, Treece spoke.

“Alright, I have a meeting with Mr Drake to attend. I expect an outline of security measures by this afternoon and for those measures to be implemented by nightfall.” Treece exited his office without another word.

“Son of a bitch,” Eddie muttered.

“You think yours is bad?” Richard asked. “They put the Mexican in the back.”

“Sucks to suck,” Donna said while walking out. “Good luck with those outlines.”

""Ladies and gentlemen, scientists, innovators, visionaries. I thank you all for gathering here today. When I founded the LIFE Foundation, I had a simple but profound belief: humanity is on the brink of a new era, one where diseases are eradicated before they appear, where resources are abundant, where humanity lives not just in survival but in harmony and strength. This isn't just my belief; it’s our mission. Our mission to—” Carlton Drake paused, placing a hand on his chest as he tried to stop a coughing fit. After a moment where nothing seemed to happen, Drake opened his mouth to continue but that was when the coughing started once again.

The CEO grabbed the edge of his desk, trying to stay upright as his lungs acted on their own. As the fit slowed, there was a knock on his office door.

“Mr Drake?” A voice called through the door. “Are you alright?”

“I'm fine,” Drake called back. “Just practicing my speech, come in.”

Drake stood strong as Dr Dora Skirth entered his office. 

“Yes, Doctor?” Drake asked.

“I have the results for Project Panacea.” Dora held up a file. “I'm happy to report that—”

“Not now,” Drake interrupted. “Meet me after the gala, we'll talk about results then.”

“But Drake, we're hitting a—”

“I know what we're about to hit Dr Skirth,” Drake interrupted again. “I'm excited as you are about it. However, I have greater things to attend to. After all, you need money for what we do.”

“Yes Mr Drake.” Dora slid the file back under her arm.

Dora walked out of the office, passing Treece just as he was walking in.

“Mr Treece,” Drake greeted. “I assume you have news for me.”

“I spoke with Idaho,” Treece said.

Drake nodded, walking over and closing his office door before locking it. Drake also pulled his phone and pressed something, causing the windows to tint.

“Let's go over it from the top.”

=================

Night had fallen fast over New York and the LIFE Foundation's gala was in full swing.

Eddie was, as he dreaded, smack dab in the middle of it all. Luckily, the fear of being constantly bothered by the wasted rich wasn't as true as Eddie thought it would be. In fact, it seemed the wasted rich didn't realize he existed. They all went about the gala and not a glance or word was sent his way.

It was actually quite nice.

“Howdy partner.”

Son of a bitch.

Turning around, Eddie found himself face to face with a bearded man, dressed in a wrinkled black suit with a red Hawaiian button-up to match his red hair.

“Hello sir.” Eddie tightened his jaw and did his best to hold his composure.

“Angry?” The man asked and Eddie felt thrown off, being read so easily. “Don't worry about that, friend. It's only human to be angry and it's very human to indulge that anger. Trust me on that, there was a time I acted very human.”

The man, smiling just a bit too wide, took a step towards Eddie and Eddie's hand slipped to his gun.

“Lethal force immediately?” The man asked. “You're very human too, huh?”

Eddie went cold, sliding his hand away from the gun to his taser.

“Who are you?” Eddie asked.

The man smiled.

“I'm the flame which the moths find irresistible.” Before Eddie could dwell on that, the lights cut out and the gala went dark. 

“Burn them all!” A woman, dressed in a service staff uniform, screamed as she lit a molotov. Before she could toss it, Eddie pulled his pistol and planted a bullet between her eyes. The dead woman fell and the lit bottle fell atop her, lighting her corpse ablaze. The burning body and the gunshot sent the whole room into chaos, guests running while more folks, both staff and party goers, pulled weapons.

“We are under attack on the main floor!” Eddie yelled into his radio after he ripped it off his belt. 

“We're under attack in the staff areas too!” Richard's voice buzzed in.

“All security units get into action! Secure the building and protect the guests!” Treece's voice screamed. “Lethal force authorized!”

In the distant darkness, muzzle flashes went off and loud bangs roared over the screaming guests. Revealing more of the attackers as they fired back with their own weapons or lit flaming ones.

Eddie spun around, trying to face the man but mid-spin, a fist struck him in the side of the head and he collapsed to the floor.

“Beautiful, isn't it?” The man asked. “What a perfect metaphor for what is coming.”

The man backed up and vanished into the dark before Eddie could recover. Just as Eddie was getting up, a waiter wielding a flaming machete rushed at him. Eddie quickly picked up his gun and immediately aimed at the waiter. With a quick squeeze of the trigger, a bullet shredded through the waiter's gut yet he didn't stop charging.

Eddie stepped back, narrowly avoiding a sloppy swing of the flaming blade. The waiter swung again but Eddie jumped back, putting in enough distance for Eddie to take a second shot, blowing a hole through the waiter's cheek. This wasn't enough to stop the waiter as he went for another swing but Eddie took a third shot, making the waiter crumble to the floor as a bullet punctured his chest.

“Heretic!”

Eddie turned just in time to see a woman dressed in a sparkling red dress rush at him. Eddie couldn't move his aim in her direction fast enough, letting her jump and use all her body weight to tackle Eddie to the ground, his gun jumping from his hand in the process.

“You'll burn for the Flame!” The woman raised a knife above her head and thrust it down to stab Eddie in the chest. Thinking fast, Eddie caught the blade with his hand, hissing as his palm was sliced open.

The woman pulled the knife back, further damaging Eddie's hand, and licked the blood from the blade.

“A worthy sacrifice!” The woman went for another stab but stopped and started convulsing.

In the moment she took for her theatrics, Eddie had used his good hand to grab his taser and jam it into the side of the woman's leg. It was only when the woman's eyes started rolling back did Eddie pull the taser away from her flesh. Pushing the fried woman off of him, Eddie once again climbed onto his feet. Coinciding with this was the emergency lights finally kicking on, revealing the chaos.

Bodies were everywhere, and security and the intruders were still fighting, now far more precisely since the room was lit up properly instead of scattered flames being the only light source. Eddie was thankfully far enough away from all of it to take a breath and pick up his fallen sidearm.

“This way,” Eddie heard a voice off to the side.

Looking, Eddie found himself looking through an open side door that exited from the gala room. He watched as Donna, gun drawn, walked past the door. Eddie was ready to assume that she was leading a group to safety but he was quickly and horrendously proven wrong. Following Donna were a group of masked men and women, each dressed in red and wielding a weapon. By the time Eddie registered what he just saw, the group was out of sight.

Without wasting another moment, Eddie rushed after them.

=================

“Forward!” Treece ordered after putting down another attacker. Behind him was Drake, who was trying his best to keep his head about him. The two advanced down a long hallway, Drake having to keep his eyes up to avoid looking at the body Treece had just created.

“We're almost there sir, the emergency exit is just another corner turn away,” Treece assured.

“We can't leave yet!” Drake protested. “The research!”

“There's no choice.” Treece continued to lead the way. “We'll have to secure the labs after the building is cleared!”

“What if there's nothing left to secure?” Drake asked.

Treece thought over it.

“We'll just have to start over.”

“We can't! After this, I don't even know if there's going to be a LIFE Foundation tomorrow!”

Treece stopped to consider this but a molotov landed on the floor behind him and Drake. Looking back, Treece found a whole group of attackers flooding into the hall.

“It's out of our hands!” Treece grabbed Drake’s hand and started rushing to the exit, firing behind him at the pursuing attackers.

=================

Dora sat as still as she could, trying her very best to not start crying.

“This is a nice lab.” The man in the red Hawaiian shirt stalked around the place, his followers standing around near him. “The type of place only a billionaire, or at least a supposed billionaire, can get you.”

The man grabbed a rod off a table.

“Now I'm no book-learning type but this looks like a cattle prod.” The man clicked a button and indeed, an electrical current sparked off the edge. “Now, this looks a bit too flimsy for a security baton. So I'm guessing, this is for your subjects.”

The man neared Dora.

“Where are they?” He asked, holding the prod in her direction.

“I don't know what you're talking about,” Dora lied.

The man laughed before poking her with the prod and zapping her. Dora screamed and jumped up from her seat, causing one of the followers to grab her by the shoulders and force back into it.

“Don't lie to me! I have developed a stunning level of patience over the past few years, but lying is a good way to burn through it fast,” The man warned. “Where are your specimens?”

“I don't know what you're talking about—AH!” Dora screamed as the man zapped her again.

“I'm playing baseball here, doc,” the man said. “Three strikes and you're out, which is really bad for you since it seems you're down to your last ball.”

The man pressed the prod to the skin of Dora's neck.

“One last chance: where do you keep the specimens?”

Dora sucked in a deep breath.

“There's a vault in this lab, I can't open it on my own. It requires two personnel authorization.”

The man let the prod stoop to his side.

“Who do I need?” He asked.

“Someone who's likely already out of the building,” Dora said with a small smile. “It can't be opened.”

“Don't be so sure.” Donna entered the lab, followed by her masked squad. “I brought you a gift.”

Donna tossed a severed finger to the man.

“A gift from the departed Dr Lloyd Emerson, meant for Cletus Kasady.”

The man, now known as Cletus, lifted up the finger in Dora's face, leaving the doctor to look on in overwhelmed horror over both the mutilated body part and the security woman betraying her.

“Come on,” Cletus urged. “Just give us what we want, what’s the point of being so difficult? You're protecting company assets at the cost of your health, it's pointless.”

“This isn't pointless! We're doing something important here, something that will help people, and I'm not going to give that to you!” Dora snapped. “This is the most important thing I've ever done!”

“More important than your kids?” Donna asked, causing Dora to go wide-eyed in shock and fear.

“Oh, wow,” Cletus said through a laugh. “That's why you don't tell coworkers shit, it means they know it and well, you never quite know who they are.”

Cletus grabbed Dora by the front of her shirt, lifting her out of the seat.

“For your children,” Cletus whispered. “Give me what I want or else I'll orphan them and I'll make sure they get pieces of you on their birthdays for as long as I can rip you apart.”

Dora's breath was caught in her throat and her resolve broke.

“Follow me.” Dora led Cletus over to a nondescript looking wall, where she opened a small panel that hid a fingerprint scanner. An opposite scanner appeared on the wall and Cletus pressed the severed finger to it. Dora pressed her thumb to the scanner and after a moment, the wall opened. Hidden behind it was a vault, which held two containers.

In one container was a strange living red fluid, violently trying to break free. In the second container was a similar white and black living ooze, moving but not trying to free itself like its crimson counterpart. 

“At last.” Cletus grabbed the container with the red liquid. “I've heard you calling for so long, it's nice to finally meet you.”

Cletus turned to face his followers.

“The flame burns brightest in the dark and tonight, the darkness has become inevitable. Yet my flame! Our flame! Will not die out, I shall lead you to the future and we'll feast upon the hearts of the past!” Donna and the followers cheered, for a moment before gunshots started ripping through the group.

Dora dove behind a desk while Donna tried to pull her weapon, only to be shot in the upper arm, forcing her to drop her weapon and duck behind cover. The rest of the followers attempted to turn and fight but they were cut down too fast, leaving an unafraid Cletus standing alone.

Eddie moved close, pistol leveled with Cletus’ head.

“Drop it!’ Eddie demanded.

“Why don't you drop me?” Cletus casually approached Eddie. “You're already spilled so much blood, why stop now?”

“Shut up!” Eddie pressed the barrel to Cletus’ forehead. “You're not going to get the easy way out of this.”

Cletus laughed.

“I suppose taking lives is pretty easy for you.”

“You don't know anything about me,” Eddie hissed. “Now drop the thing and get on your knees.”

Cletus smiled.

“Come on Eddie,” Cletus poked. “Be human.”

A single shot rang out and Eddie collapsed, dropping his gun as he clutched his bleeding chest. Donna had crawled from cover and retrieved her weapon before shooting her comrade without hesitation. Cletus stood over Eddie.

“I'm not sure what validation you were searching for, but let it be known: there is nobody who could have ever given it to you.” Cletus looked to Donna. “Let's go.”

The two quickly abandoned the lab, leaving Eddie alone, his world fading and vision going black. As he started to vanish, Eddie could only think about one thing, only one regret.

He should have called them.

Just as Eddie was closing his eyes, a burning feeling surged through his chest and spread. It spread down through his stomach and legs and up through his arms and head. In a moment, Eddie went from the knife’s edge to feeling more sensation than he ever had before. Eddie sat up and screamed, causing Dora to stumble back away from him and drop the empty container she was holding.

“What?!” Eddie grabbed his chest, where he had been shot, and found no wound, just a hole in his shirt. “What did you do?!”

Dora's jaw opened but no answer came out, being interrupted as an alarm blared. The fire alarm, which only went off when a wheel floor was engulfed.

“We have to leave!” 

Eddie rose to his feet and with an unnatural ease, picked up Dora and slung her over his shoulder. He started running, faster than a man should be able to, out of the lab and down a long hall and all the way to an emergency exit. Putting down Dora, Eddie pushed on the exit door and was startled when the whole thing came off its hinges. Shocked, Eddie looked to Dora for an explanation.

“I know this is strange but I don't have all the answers for you right now, give me time.” Eddie grabbed Dora's ID card off her coat, pocketing it.

“I'll hold you to that.” 

With that, Eddie and Dora ran out the exit, fleeing away from the LIFE Foundation, whose building had several of its floors burning in flames.

1gha52b,https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1gha52b/food_allowance/,Food allowance,"Our food allowance is way too low compared with other CROs. For context, this is outside US and other CROs’ food allowance would average $8 per meal which is decent enough in our country. Personally, I only spend about $5-6 on each meal. However, the company (a Sponsor) only allows us to reimburse food expense at $4 per day, including delivery charges (about $1 or so depending on the restaurant’s distance from site), leaving us with $3 which can barely afford a fast food meal. We can’t even afford to get ourselves coffee with this kind of budget. 

We have raised this countless times with the management, but they are being firm about this allowance because according to them, employees are expected to show up in the office but are not reimbursed for their lunches, and in the same manner, we are expected to work onsite so we should be covering our meals like we do when working in the office. 

When we shared to them other CROs’ food allowance compared to ours, we were asked not to compare as we are getting better compensation packages and benefits than them, which is actually true. 

I could not have been more thankful to be in this company, because they are not lying when they said benefits and packages here are better, but having that kind of food allowance just feels a little too much for me. I guess coming from a CRO with a $8-food allowance, this is a huge adjustment for me that I am still unable to accept it even after more than year of working with this Sponsor. 

Not sure what the point of this post is lol I guess I just wanted to get this off my chest as I only had sad-looking sandwich and water for lunch after dealing with a difficult SC. ",1,1730480118.0,clinicalresearch,1,1.0,False

1gha118,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokunoheroFanfiction/comments/1gha118/you_always_have_to_follow_family_traditions/,You always have to follow family traditions.,"In this universe Izuku was born with a quirk which is pyrokinesis, some time later it was taken by Hisashi who in this universe is a hired hitman called ""The Blind Dragon""

The nickname is due to the fact that Hisashi faced Endeavor and came out losing the flames of endeavor, which burned his eyes and part of his face and body, making him blind but never leaving behind the """"old ways"""" which is to train your son and mold him to be a hitman like him   
  
Here Hisashi is not an abusive father, much less he was simply influenced by his family's methods and indoctrination at an early age.   
  
here Inko gained weight as in the canon due to stress since Izuku was in a few words kidnapped as if he had never existed. 

Hisashi did not kill Inko because according to his words

""""She was very sweet, she was a hitman but not a monster...plus she made good katsudon""""

Izuku would end up in U.A as in the canon since AFO paid Hisashi that if Aoyama said the least...well cement shoes for Aoyama and his family, a house on fire erase all possible data that Aoyama's family It existed...you already know the usual

Aoyama knows that Izuku was hired as his executioner in case he ever said the slightest thing about his quirk. This was thanks to AFO who made the seed of fear stronger.

Izuku took a false identity and a hair and eye color change quirk courtesy of AFO  
  
Although everything it would go wrong when in the fight with Stain, Manual accidentally threw water on him, removing the effect of the quirk since it works but it breaks when receiving water since being a liquid that is not stagnant or still makes the effect of the quirk disappear.   
  
Izuku would end up with an electric anklet and in 1-A but every few days having interrogations and talks with Tsukauchi   
  
Hisashi did not help Izuku due to family tradition which dictates that parents should not take responsibility for their children's mistakes since a professional has standards.   
  
Izuku was trained in various combat arts by Hisashi, although he is not a John Wick or anything like that, Izuku's level would be rather decent, but not at the level of being able to take down a Pro Hero.

Izuku was not taken to Tartarus or a correctional facility because being the son of a hitman who killed quite a few could lead Izuku to meet Saint Peter at a very young age.  
  
Hisashi killed several relatives of those who are in Tartarus according to his words ""money is money like family is family I mean I don't regret it""  
  
Izuku was once sent to kill All Might but ended up receiving a premium ticket from the hero because he became so nervous that he was not able to give him the cyanide mixed with coffee prepared by Garaki.

I have been experiencing this very specific kind of pain every now and then for about two years now. The pain starts in the center of my chest right at solar plexus and then radiates through to my back and is so intense my teeth also hurt. Sometimes it starts in the middle of the night and wakes me up, sometimes starts about an hour after eating Indian food (butter chicken is what I usually get- and this is the only consistent thing, so I thought I'd mention it), sometimes in the morning after I have coffee. This time, I had spicy soup for dinner last night and it started this morning at about 9am. It does not always happen after eating fatty or spicy food. I usually just take Advil Dual Action and the pain goes away after about half an hour. I would say it happens maybe twice a month, but it is intense - about 7/10 on the pain scale. Googling around it really sounds like pancreatitis to me, but I don't know. If I need to talk to my PCP about it, what should I ask for as far as testing goes?

The brass band’s music rang out triumphantly, the sound carrying across the whole venue. Except, that wasn’t entirely true. Those at the very front of the crowd were suitably deafened by the booming instruments, but Empire State University had spared no expense in making sure everyone had an equal opportunity at tinnitus. Top of the line microphones collected the sounds of each musician and amplifiers reproduced that sound for all assembled to hear, blasting patriotic classics and marching band-esque arrangements of modern hits alike. 

From where Ben Reilly was sitting, he was getting a mixture of live music and the speakers’ mix, which played with just enough of a delay to be rather quite disorientating the more he listened to it. Luckily for him, he had plenty of other things to focus on.

Today was a big day, a day he had looked forward to for as long as he could remember. Growing up, the idea of being a college graduate came with a healthy dose of conflict. On one hand, it felt only natural, with the dreams he had, that college was in his future. On the other hand, Uncle Ben and Aunt May were pretty terrible at hiding just how much of a pipe dream it was for them to afford the fees, even with them putting aside all they could. 

But all of that seemed so far away now, especially as Ben’s row was called up to the stage to collect their diplomas. 

As he stood, Ben discretely adjusted his flowing red gown. As he shuffled along with the rest of his row, he pushed a finger under his cap and scratched at his scalp. Was it the cap or the brown hair dye that was driving him crazy?

One by one, names were called, and ESU students marched across the stage to raucous applause, shaking hands with the dean, taking their diplomas, and thus leaving their student life behind. Nervous, Ben looked from the wings of the stage, over his shoulder and down to the very back of his row which was yet to make it up onto the stage. There, he saw Gwen Stacy, clad in the same red cap and gown, who gave him a wide smile of encouragement.  He shut his eyes, took a deep breath, and then heard the name he had been dreading.

*“Peter Parker!”*

He heard the name twice, once from the announcer’s mouth, and then a half second later from the booming speakers. Both times, it cut him like a knife. 

But he couldn’t let it show. Instead, he plastered on the biggest smile he could and marched across the stage for the diploma - for *Peter Parker’s* diploma.


&nbsp;

🔹🕸️🕷️🕸️🔹

&nbsp;


“Oh, just look at you, Peter!” cooed Aunt May, who could barely contain her joy as she moved to straighten every wrinkle in the red graduation gown. Ben smiled, content to let her fuss over him all she wanted. After all, this was all for her. 

It had been two months since the biggest gang war to ever hit New York City. Two months since Spider-Man had gone missing, Peter Parker along with him. For a whole month, May was left to worry and wonder what had happened to the nephew she had raised as a son, whether the only family she had left was still alive. Then, two women arrived at Ben Reilly’s doorstep with a proposition. 

Mary Jane Watson and Gwen Stacy knew that Peter Parker was Spider-Man, and both of them cared for Aunt May deeply. This led them to ask Ben a simple request: that he stand in for Peter in his absence, that he step into his shoes and pretend to be the young man who had gone missing during the gang war, and give Aunt May some peace of mind until Peter came back, which they were certain he would. Parts of that were easier, namely pulling off the deceit. After all, Ben was - by all accounts - identical to the missing Peter Parker. Whether he was a genetic duplicate, mirror world doppelganger, or something more sinister, Ben didn’t know. What he did know was that he had most of Peter’s childhood memories. In fact, he remembered almost everything up to becoming Spider-Man, after which things started to get more spotty, more hazy.

Not content to simply fuss over him, Aunt May pulled her nephew into a tight embrace. Over her shoulder, he saw hundreds of other families in similar situations across the field, celebrating their kids’ graduations. In the corner of his eye was Gwen, with what looked to be her father.

“Oh, I’m sure your Uncle Ben is smiling down on you now!” May smiled, tears welling up.

Years ago, after discovering there was another Peter Parker living the life he remembered leading, the young man’s choice for a new name was simple. ‘Ben’ for his uncle, who had been murdered years before, and ‘Reilly’ for his Aunt May’s maiden name. As he thought of his Uncle Ben looking down on him now, Ben quietly frowned. What would he think of deceiving May like this? How could he possibly understand this Twilight Zone world they now lived in?

But Ben could hardly tear himself up about it too much. After all, here he was, in his Aunt May’s arms. And swaddled in that warmth he had missed for so many years, it was easy to push that guilt so far away.

“I wish he were here,” said Ben as he slowly pulled away from May’s hug. 

“Honey, he is,” May smiled, moving a hand to the cross around her neck. “And he is so, so proud of you, as am I.”

Ben then noticed a flicker of familiarity in May’s eyes as she spotted someone she recognised approaching from behind Ben’s back. Then, before Ben could think to turn and look, his Spider-Sense sent ripples through his flesh. As he darted around, Ben saw the all-too-familiar visage of Norman Osborn only a few feet away.

“Mr Parker!” Osborn exclaimed with a wide grin.

Ben’s memories of being Spider-Man were an unreliable blur, but since his encounter with Norman at the vigil a month ago, his memories of Spidey’s dealings with Oscorp were crystal clear. Oscorp had created the radioactive spider that bit Peter, Osborn had captured and experimented on Peter to understand how his powers work, and then he had used that same technology to try and enhance himself, instead turning himself into the hulking and rampaging Green Goblin. Since SHIELD had carted Norman away years ago, he had been assumed dead. And then all of a sudden he was back, attending a vigil for everyone that had gone missing during the gang war, including his son and Peter’s friend, Harry. And now, here he was again.

“Mr Osborn, it’s good to see you,” Ben lied, moving forward to shake his hand. Norman’s handshake was firm, but not intimidating. No, his mere presence did that by itself. 

“And you too,” Norman replied. “I was so touched to see the university set out chairs for the students among those missing and… Well, I’m sure it means a lot to the other families.”

“Of course,” said May, bowing her head. “Our best wishes, Norman. Harry continues to be in all of my nightly prayers.”

“Thank you, Mrs Parker. You know, we will have to see about getting dinner some time. The three of us. Emily too.”

At the vigil, Ben couldn’t understand Norman’s actions. Having experimented on Peter more than once, by any logic he should have known that Peter Parker was Spider-Man, and yet he seemed to be showing no signs of knowing. But in the month since, as Ben walked more and more in Peter’s shoes, more memories came flooding back. Ben remembered saving Harry from the Green Goblin and compromising his identity, only for SHIELD to step in and ‘relieve’ Harry of those memories with technology like something out of Men In Black. Ben remembered them using the same technology on one of Norman’s associates, Alyosha Kravinoff, after he confronted Peter at school. Now, Ben didn’t know how long Norman had been in SHIELD custody, or for how long he had been free of them, but it was very possible - likely even - that Director Fury had altered Norman’s memories too, causing him to forget the true identity of Spider-Man.

And now, with Norman standing in front of him once again, Ben wanted nothing more than to probe him for information. Where had he been? What else had SHIELD done to him? What was he planning now? But he knew better than to scratch at any walls in Norman’s memory that could be keeping Spider-Man’s secrets locked tightly away. For now, small talk would have to do.

The next day, as the wind whipped past him, Ben couldn’t help but think this was the easiest part about stepping into Peter’s shoes. Hot off of stopping a purse snatcher, Spider-Man raced across Manhattan at breakneck pace, hurtling downwards and then rocketing upwards carried by his webs. It had taken no time to tap into the muscle memory of slinging and swinging, pulling off impressive acrobatic manoeuvres with ease. In the years past, Ben was limited in how much he could get out and just swing, having to be careful to not end up on Spider-Man’s radar. But with Peter missing, and Ben officially moonlighting as the friendly neighbourhood wall crawler, he could swing as freely as he pleased. That also meant he was back to fighting crime wherever he saw it, which was hardly easy but nothing compared to being thrown into the deep end behind the scenes of the Maggia-Goblin gang war, labouring breathlessly to minimise civilian casualties.

Of course, he had to get himself a new suit. The improvised red jumpsuit and blue hoodie combo he had rocked when he came out of hiding was fine for then, but now he needed something more traditional if he was stepping in for the real deal. As Ben swung down 53rd Street and past the MoMA, tethering around the corner to speed down 6th Avenue, he felt proud and secure inside the suit he had built with a bit of help from Gwen Stacy, Peter’s girlfriend. It had all the familiar shapes, but with an overwhelming amount of navy blue down Ben’s arms and legs. Still, bright and big was the web-patterned red across his chest and mask, with a much larger black spider insignia emblazoned across his torso. Something to loudly proclaim that Spider-Man was back.

Mid-swing, Ben ejected a spent web-fluid cartridge and pressed another into place, smiling. Around his wrists wrapped silver web shooters, a bulkier model than Spider-Man had recently used, but they held sentimental value. Ben had fished them out from under Peter’s bed at Aunt May’s house, the last remains of the hi-tech suit he remembered inheriting from his father’s Oscorp days, the Mark Ones.

As he swung, he had to fight against the rest of the world slipping away, helped by the sudden buzzing in his ear. A text message. He didn’t need to check who it was, it was obvious. Obvious he was late.

&nbsp;

🔹🕸️🕷️🕸️🔹

&nbsp;

Ben pulled his green turtleneck up as he turned the corner out of one of the many alleys he had stashed a change of clothes in and rushed down the street. The café was a whole block away, but he reminded himself he was already late. What was a few minutes more? He would have suggested the home field comforts of the Daily Grind, but there were too many people there who knew the face of Ben Reilly. No, this was firmly a Peter Parker sort of social function.

He pushed into the café and was immediately hit with the smells of sizzling bacon and the world’s strongest coffee. The place wasn’t his suggestion, but his needs were simple enough that he immediately knew it would do. Ben then looked to his left and immediately saw who he was looking for.

Ned Leeds rose from his seat with a smile on his face. He looked so different to how Ben remembered him, and not just for the smooth silver suit he was dressed in. He had lost weight, gotten into grooming, and most importantly found a confidence that suited him splendidly. “Pete!” he beamed.

Ben moved over to him and threw his arms around Ned. 

While he had a lot of Peter’s memories, there was also a lot Ben was missing, presumably from and around when there started to be two Peters in New York instead of one, parts from after their lives diverged. Peter had graduated high school, Eddie had gone off to the army, Mary had left and returned to New York, Flash had apologised to Peter and Peter had forgiven him. It left Ben in a difficult situation where he desperately wanted to reconnect with all of the people who he remembered as being so important to him, but couldn’t get too close in case they realised he had forgotten so many recent events. But Ned was different. Ned was someone who - as Ben quickly learned - had hardly spoken to Peter since high school, who rushed off to Los Angeles to start a life in entertainment journalism and spent a lot of time trying and failing to keep in touch with his childhood friends. So now, as he came back to NYC to look after his family following the gang war, Ned was in the perfect place to reconnect with his childhood friend, and Ben knew just as much about him as Peter would. 

“Hey, before I forget: congratulations on graduating!” Ned added, patting Ben on the back before sinking back into his seat.

“Congrats on the new job!” Ben replied as he moved to the chair opposite Ned’s. “Couldn’t have come at a better time.”

“Yeah, well, I slipped the Bugle a couple of celebrity exclusives back when Jameson was in charge, and I guess Robbie wanted to return the favour,” Ned replied. “Makes me the new *entertainment consultant*.”

“You’ve come a long way from movie reviews in the school newspaper!” Ben chuckled.

“Don’t knock it, Mom still has some of those framed on the refrigerator,” Ned teased back. 

“How are your folks?” asked Ben, remembering what they had gone through recently.

“Okay,” Ned replied. “Dad hurt his back coming out of retirement to help the fire department during the gang stuff, so they’re both really grateful having me and Winn back from out west to help out around the house.”

“That’s great,” Ben smiled. “Hey, do you remember when Eddie blew chunks on the school trip to the zoo?” 

Ned’s face lit up as he almost spilt his coffee. “Oh, because he saw that giraffe giving birth!”

“Yeah!” Ben chuckled. “You think about it, they really shouldn’t have left a pregnant giraffe in the open enclosure…”

“I think I remember Eddie saying something like that - pretty emphatically - on the bus ride home!” Ned replied

“They teach you big words like ‘emphatically’ in Hollywood?” Ben teased.

Ned smirked. “I’m sure they taught you lots of big words studying Chemistry, eh, Pete? Like, uh, *‘hydrochloric’*.”

Ben shook his head and smiled. “We both learned about hydrochloric acid in 7th grade, remember?”

“Yeah, well I trust you’ve learned a lot more since!” Ned continued. “Speaking of: What are you gonna do with that degree, huh? What are your next steps?”

“Uh, well—”

Ben had no idea. He had no sort of long term plan, especially not as Peter. The *real* Peter Parker could show back up any day now, especially with Mary and Gwen out looking for him. And that was to say nothing about the fact that Ben hadn’t studied a day at ESU. Hell, he didn’t even remember graduating high school. He had spent the last few years revising for his GED in between as many shifts as he could put in at the Daily Grind to support himself. Any future employment plans for him would certainly have nothing to do with science, with his dream, for at least the foreseeable future.

But Peter was different. Peter was a college graduate. 

“I’m not sure,” Ben replied. “Honestly, I went straight from high school to college, and haven’t stopped. Maybe everything that’s happened lately is a good sign to… slow down, take some time figuring things out.”

Ned furrowed his brow, considering his response. 

“Fair enough,” said Ned. “Hey, did you hear Eddie’s back in town?”

No. Ben very much had not heard that. “He is?” he replied. “From the army?”

“Yeah, from the army. Got a security job somewhere.”

“You’ve spoken to him?” Ben asked. By all accounts, Peter hadn’t seen Eddie for years either. 

“No,” said Ned. “Just, you know, word on the street.”

Ben nodded. “Right…”

“Anyway—” Ned rose to his feet. “It’s been real, but the Bugle calls. It’s been great to see you, Pete. We’ll have to do this again sometime soon.”

“Yeah,” Ben smiled. “For sure.”


&nbsp;

🔹🕸️🕷️🕸️🔹

&nbsp;


So, with Ned on his way back to the Daily Bugle offices, Ben similarly got back to work, taking back to the skies as Spider-Man just in time for a nightly patrol. He made his usual rounds, continuing the habits he had fallen into over the last month, checking in with various firehouses, keeping an eye on the city’s darkest alleys, and otherwise staying alert for anything odd. It was a careful balance for the web-slinger, to keep his eye on the street below while able to climb so high.

It was a quiet night in Manhattan - which was hard to come by - so when Ben spotted a familiar face down on the ground, he felt justified to slow down on peoplewatch for a bit.

Flash Thompson was walking down Broadway, his hand intertwined with another young man Ben recognised by Mary’s briefings as Hobie Brown, his boyfriend. As Ben clung to the billboard atop the Stephen Sondheim Theatre, he watched the pair walking down West 43rd Street, exchanging inaudible words. The last Ben remembered talking to Flash, he was something of a blunt instrument, a bully however you sliced it. Now, he seemed more himself than Ben had ever seen. But something was wrong. Flash and Hobie seemed to have had a good night - perhaps they had seen a show - but Flash was very clearly on edge. 

Ben knew that Flash was only two months off of being attacked by the Hobgoblin and held captive, only rescued by a chase encounter with Daredevil. Hobgoblin was still in the wind, unaccounted for. It was only natural that Flash would be tense. 

Ben thought back to all the times he remembered being shoved into lockers, or publicly humiliated by the apparent ‘alpha-jock’ all those years ago. Like all of those days, they felt so far away. It was difficult for Ben to gauge how much he himself had changed from that pubescent teenager he had remembered being, the kid who had to learn responsibility the hard way. He had a whole new name now, new friends - albeit only a few, and was trying in earnest to forge new dreams. But all of that had been put on hold for this whole operation of Mary and Gwen’s. But Flash, it was clear as day how much he had grown; how far he had come from where he started.

So, figuring that this was such a quiet night in Manhattan, the Friendly Neighbourhood Spider-Man elected to follow Flash and Hobie from a distance - at least for a few blocks - to make sure they got home okay.

Then, half an hour and a subway train later, Ben watched as Flash planted a kiss on Hobie’s cheek before Hobie vanished into his apartment building. It looked as though Flash was going in as well, but had elected for a moment to himself outside. Then, something unexpected happened.

Flash looked up, and across the street, directly to the spot on the parallel wall to which Spider-Man clung, limbs sprawled out. He didn’t need to call out; he knew Spidey knew.

So, with a quick web zip, Ben flung himself across the street and landed with bowed legs to absorb the shock, just feet away from Flash.

“Hey Spider-Man,” said Flash. He seemed more tired, perhaps confused, than angry. “I dig the new suit.”

“Oh, this?” Spidey replied with a chirp. “This is just a seasonal thing; don’t get too attached.”

“Were you following us home?” Flash asked. He moved back slowly. It was astounding, he was thoroughly unafraid of the masked hero. There were few civilians like that. “I saw you a few times on our way back. Thought I’d lost you when we took the subway.”

Ben looked around. The street seemed mostly empty, well out of the way of the nightly hubbub. Here he was, dressed in full Spidey regalia, having a conversation on the street with Flash Thompson. *Absurd.*

He began, “Look, I know you’ve been having a hard time and—”

“Wait, you know me?”

*Oh, God.*

“Spider-Man knows me!” Flash’s face lit up with warmth. Not the same warmth Ben saw when he was with Hobie, with a simple joy. Almost childlike. “Look, Spider-Man, I’ve always been a huge fan, but… aren’t there thousands of people in New York that could have done with a walk home? I’m sure we would have been fine.”

The old Flash would have gotten violent at even the implication he could have needed help with something, nevermind something as immensely masculine as keeping himself safe. But this Flash? Ben could see why Peter had forgiven him for everything.

“I’ll be honest, Flash,” Spidey replied. Flash couldn’t hide his reaction - only minimise it - to being addressed by name by the hero. “What happened to you was enough to really mess anyone up… and I guess I’m sorry I wasn’t there to rescue you.”

Flash had been coming in pretty quick with his replies, but this time he took a moment, considering his words carefully. This time, it was a lot harder for Ben to read his mind looking at his face. Then he spoke.

“Thank you, Spider-Man,” he managed a small, earnest smile. “I… haven’t been doing all that well, and… Well, maybe I’ll sleep better knowing you’ve got my back. But, it’s not your job to rescue everyone in New York. Not all at once. I’m sure you saved a lot of people that night, and I’m grateful that they’re safe because of you.”

Ben nodded. And he kept nodding, perhaps a tad too much. Then he took a deep breath. “You got it.” He shot a web up to the building above. “Take care of yourself, Flash.”

Flash smiled.

And Spider-Man pulled on the web, lifting himself up and away.


&nbsp;

🔹🕸️🕷️🕸️🔹

&nbsp;


There were many parts of stepping into Peter Parker’s shoes that were as easy as pie. Looking like the guy, remembering enough of his life to keep up appearances - that was no issue. Getting to reunite with all these people he had missed for so long, that was like a gift from above. Bearing the guilt of his deception was harder, but justifiable given the circumstances. Bluffing his way through conversations with people Peter had met in the years since Ben’s memories ended, that was hard. But then, getting to be New York’s hero was its own reward. 

But that was nothing compared to Ben’s favourite thing about being Peter Parker, or getting to be him this past month. It was his ability to be continually surprised by New York, by its people, by its resilience and its capacity for change. He looked forward to being a part of that as Ben Reilly.

With the night coming to a close, Ben swung off towards the edge of the city, out towards Queens, where Aunt May was waiting. But he didn’t get far before his Spider-Sense activated once again, his whole body lurching in shock. At the midline of his swing, Ben let go of his web, continuing on with his forward momentum. He then flung himself to the left, sending himself into a rapid spin lengthways, narrowly dodging a rapidfire volley of arrows before catching the very last one just inches before it reached his chest. 

Ben cast a web, slowing himself down and pulling himself onto the side of a nearby building, and searched the skyline in the direction the arrows had come from. It took him no time at all to find the shooter, for it seemed he wasn’t even trying to hide. There he was, standing on a lower balcony, slowly nocking another arrow onto his bow. Hawkeye.

By no means do you have to be Jewish, I just put that in there since I live in an area with few other Jews, so it’s nice to connect with other members of the tribe. Happy to talk to people who are curious about it too, but I am by no means an expert. 

I’m a nerd in general , so feel free to talk nerdy to me, but my interests are broad and I can get into anything anyone else is passionate about. Science, philosophy, creative writing, gaming, working out, photography, cooking, F1 - these are all on the table to name just a few. 

I’m the kind of guy that savours his morning coffee, likes to do the crossword or wordle between sips, and enjoys those quiet moments. It would be nice to share those moments with another person. 

I am a fan of playful banter, shameless flirting and being an all around degenerate, but that’s not the main goal of this post. I am open to seeing where things go, but let’s take it slow, okay?

1gh9f3c,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1gh9f3c/vetting_freelancers_might_be_a_controversial_take/,Vetting Freelancers (Might be a controversial take),"This post was inspired by [u/explorespace9](https://www.reddit.com/user/explorespace9/)'s post about hiring freelancers, and I wanted to share some friendly advice that might be controversial. Let's break this down into easy-to-follow steps!

Before jumping into the hiring process, take a moment to:

\- Decide what you want to build (MVP or full app?)

\- Figure out your timeline

\- Set a realistic budget

\- Know which technologies you want to use

Having this clarity makes everything so much smoother! It's like having a shopping list before going to the grocery store - you know exactly what you're looking for.

The Hiring Process: Making It Simple

Step 1: The First Meeting (The ""Get to Know You"" Call)

\- Have a video chat with your camera on (it's like having coffee together!)

\- Talk about your project dreams and goals

\- Listen carefully to how they respond

\- Watch for signs that they're:

\- Easy to work with

\- Open to feedback

\- Good at solving problems

\- Clear communicators

Step 2: Technical Check (Making Sure They Know Their Stuff)

\- Look at their previous work (like checking out their portfolio)

\- Ask them to walk you through projects they're proud of

\- Have them solve a simple coding problem

\- Chat about why they made certain technical choices

Don't worry if you're not super technical! The key is seeing how well they explain things to you.

Making the Partnership Work

Once you've found someone you click with:

\- Set up regular check-ins (weekly or every two weeks)

\- Create clear milestones and deadlines

\- Keep communication channels open

\- Agree on how you'll track progress

About Time and Money

\- Fixed-price projects often work better than hourly rates

\- Be clear about your budget upfront

\- Remember: fair pay = quality work

Where to Look

While platforms like Upwork and Fiverr are popular, remember: it's not about where you find them, but how well you check their skills and fit.

Important Tips to Remember

1. Don't rush! Better to spend time finding the right person than fixing mistakes later
2. Location doesn't matter - great developers can be anywhere
3. Always do video calls - they tell you so much more than text chats
4. Trust your gut feeling about whether you can work well together

Take your time with the screening process. It might feel like a lot of work upfront, but it's worth it! Think of it like dating - you want to make sure you're compatible before starting a relationship.

I don’t want to go back home but I also know if I don’t it will make her even more upset. How do I fix this?,"I currently live at home. My mom and I have always had a difficult relationship. She is a very emotional person and will very often say hurtful things in the moment when she is upset or does not get her way. She excuses this by telling me it is just the way that she talks and I shouldn’t take offense to it because it isn’t personal. She relies on me heavily for emotional support and I have been trying to step back from that lately because it has been feeling suffocating at times and I want to become more independent. 

Yesterday I went to stay at my boyfriend house because a shop that I liked was offering discount mediumship readings for Halloween and I went to get one done. My mom is extremely skeptical and I knew she would ask about it so I told her I would tell her about the reading when I got back from work today. This week my car also broke down so I was going to use his car to drive to work the next day. I went to go pick up my work clothes this morning before work because I forgot them and my mom was bombarding me with questions about what the medium said yesterday. I told her I basically have 10 mins to just get my work clothes change and then go. I reiterated that I’d talk to her more in depth tonight because I’m rushing and am not focused on our conversation right now. While I went to quickly go put on some mascara she told me I needed to tell her about the reading right now because I’ve been holding out on telling her since she asked last night. I again told her I don’t have time I’ll stop by tonight and tell her. She completely blew up and told me “wow you’re such a fucking bitch sometimes did you know that? I don’t even want to know anymore don’t come home tonight.” I just told her I’m glad to see we are taking it to that level and she stormed out of the bathroom. I went back downstairs to put a lid on my cup of coffee and she was going on and on about how she’s does so much for me and I can’t even give her the time of day. That I’m always take take taking from everyone but I don’t give people the same courtesy they give me. I just stayed silent because I was in the verge of tears and didn’t want to talk to her. She told me I have enough time to make coffee I have enough time to sit down and have an actual conversation with her. I just told her I had to leave and that I love her and she told me to go fuck myself. I silenced her notifications for a couple hours because I knew she’d try to text me to apologize and she did. She said she was sorry I took offense to what she said and she didn’t mean it and should’ve used other words she’s just upset. I really don’t know what to do now though.

1gh9afs,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships_advice/comments/1gh9afs/feel_like_im_going_crazy_over_mixed_signals/,Feel like I’m going crazy over mixed signals,"So a coworker (F 26) and I (M 26) started flirting a bit back in June. She's not technically my manager, but is in a management position in an area that I occasionally help out in.


We ended up spending tons of time together at work and wound up in a weird ""more than friends"" but not dating territory since most of our interactions were limited to the workplace. We'd go on little ""dates"" during our lunch breaks like getting coffee, going somewhere off campus, or even just staying after work for an hour or two, but never really got the chance to go on a ""real"" date. Never got physical (got close at times), but did get very emotionally involved. Like she'd text me about how amazing she thought I was, how attracted she was to me, how she thought about us physically, etc.


A couple months into all that she says we have to stop because she feels guilty about being this unprofessional at work and that it would look bad if found out, but still wants to be friends because ""we get along better than anybody"". Fine, no biggie. Maybe she's just trying to spare my feelings. I have some feelings for her but play it cool and pull back a bit just so she can set whatever boundaries she wants for us. We talk a bit here and there but are basically just work friends at that point.


Fast forward to this month, she starts acting in ways that remind me of when we first started flirting and getting into our ""thing"". She's started coming around to my cubicle every day to talk, messaging me if I don't reach out, asking me to get coffee with her again, and spending time with me alone when she can. All things she did when she was initially interested, and stopped doing when she called it off. She's also started lightly breaking the touch barrier again, and I've noticed she stands so close when she comes to my cubicle that her leg will press into my shoulder when I'm sitting.


Problem is I don't know if this is her trying to be ""just friends"", or if I should go for it again and start flirting. Since yesterday I started matching her energy, and sure enough she stops seeming as enthusiastic. She'll still get coffee, chat, whatever just fine if I reach out, but isn't consistently initiating anymore. Granted it's only been two days.


I guess what I'm asking is, given the context, does this sound like she's interested again or not? On the one hand, I feel like it has to be something given our history. But on the other, maybe I WANT it to be her showing interest so badly that it's making me pick up things that aren't there. I'm just confused about what's going on here and what she could be thinking.",1,1730477962.0,relationships_advice,0,1.0,False

(Yes, still too many, but we knew who our Dirty Dozen were thanks to our Sunday meetings and tried to avoid them.) The guys closer to my age felt more like high school classmates and the few older, more established guys were more like big brothers to all of the E2-E4 in the barracks. Frankly, we were glad they were around.

One of our older guys, a mischievous E5 that I'll call Sgt. F for this story, also worked on the ambulance team for our post in his off duty time. He was one of our Good Guys (but not part of our vigilante crew). We were glad to have him around, especially when he and another E5 demanded a room close to where the women of the barracks were assigned. It cut down the Dirty Dozen's crap significantly.

We had a coffee club at the shop. They were an arrogant, misogynistic bunch, and Sgt. F had even less use for them than I did. Nobody, not even the Commander in Chief, was allowed to touch their coffee supplies, coffee pot or any of their condiments. Being the defiant little something that I am, I brought in a jar of instant coffee and used the shop's hot water (they kept it close to boiling, complete with warning signs) to prepare it. The coffee club members would loudly throw fits over it, only to have me waggle my jar at them and keep sipping. Well, I had to find my joy somewhere. It got them every time.

Because Sgt. F was on the ambulance crew, he had developed many contacts at the military hospital in Landstuhl. Through these contacts he managed to take possession of some Methylene blue dye. He went back to the shop after the members of the coffee club went home and added an unknown quantity of dye to their freshly cleaned pot.

The next day the first Club member to arrive set up the day's brew. Of course, it wasn't necessay to clean the pot that morning because he had cleaned it before he left the previous evening.

(Insert SpongeBob meme: Three Hours Later)

An unholy shriek came from the shop's rest room. A Club member came running out, looking like he saw a ghost. About an hour after that we heard another Club member shout, ""OH MY GOD!!!"" He came out running, too. Variations of this display were repeated throughout the morning.

I found Sgt. F and suggested there may be a medical emergency, because Club members were all screaming in or near the rest room, and most of them looked pretty agitated. He literally fell onto the floor, laughing. When he regained his composure he explained his dye prank to me, and how this harmless chemical turns urine blue if your kidneys are healthy. We heard another cry of consternation come from the rest room. We both collapsed in laughter. I had to work in one of the vans for the rest of my shift, just to enjoy the show.

It couldn't have happened to a more deserving bunch. Sgt. F is the hero we needed.",22,1730477833.0,FuckeryUniveristy,3,1.0,False

I'm 25 and work for a company in the niche market of X-ray diffraction/X-ray Manufacturing. It's so Niche that people can't go to college to learn the work I do, instead, we try to hire people based on drive/how long they plan on staying with the company. 

I joined the company 6 years ago, worked my way up and a year ago was promoted to a lead supervisory role. The work environment is laid back, we push for results. If you have to walk away for 20 min and just clear your head, drink a cup of coffee or feel like talking to coworkers that's absolutely allowed. As long as you get the job done.

However, the other day one of my more autistic employees was curiously debating psychology with me. Going over the concept of ""We do things because they make us feel good, even if we don't choose to do them for that reason. Subconsciously we are"" and this query really set off a different coworker that was just overhearing our conversation. We'll call him (X), he's 32. The more autistic one is (Y), he's 29.

(X) Debated that he doesn't do things because they make him feel good. He just does them because they're right. This debate started because of religion as well.. so I knew it was a hot topic and tried my best to keep it civil. He gave an example that when he offers that he ""knows a guy"" for a specific job (like concrete, car work, landscaping, etc) he's not doing that because it makes him feel good. Hes doing it just to help people. 

(Y) Agrees, and brings up holding open a door. That we hold open the door for people, not necessarily to make ourselves feel better. However, I view things as a ying yang. I debate that if you see someone coming, and you accidentally DONT hold open the door for someone. Do you feel bad? Implying that we feel bad when we don't do good things. Which means we feel good when we do them.

At this point (Y) agrees with me. But (X) stands firm and says no. That if someone's too slow, or he accidentally doesn't hold open the door for someone. He's not going to feel bad in the slightest. He wouldnt hesitate. Which, made (Y) and I raise our eyebrows a little. I couldn't really believe it. We debated a few other examples. And honestly, this is purely my speculation, but I'm convinced (X) is most likely this way because he was in the military and was trained to always do the right thing, instead of debating what is right or wrong. You purely just assume what is right, and do what's right. I didn't say this to him. But I did say ""Sounds like we're starting to debate on what is Man vs Machine."" As, reacting to things without hesitation or question like this, makes me think more machine. Now. I didn't mean for this to obviously imply I'm calling him a machine.. was just trying to have a nice conversation about psychology. But this really made (X) mad and the conversation quickly ended. 

I've noticed the past week he's been extremely petty. I shrugged it off. But he's been doing small things, like purposely only talking to other coworkers about day to day things and ignoring me completely. Before this, he used to happily talk to me and another coworker about everything in his life. But now it's just making me feel really weird. Should I confront him and say sorry? I feel as though his personality doesn't get over these things. And even if I tried bringing it up now. He would act like he hasn't thought about it since and nothing has been different. So, should I let sleeping dogs lie and hope time makes a difference? He's a hard working employee. So that side of it, I'm definitely not trying to make things worse. We've even all gone to things outside of work together. So I really just don't know how to deal with petty grievances like this.


TL;DR: I said something that offended an ex-airforce employee whose 6 years older than me and he's been passive aggressive and generally petty for the past week. (A good example is, working on a job that I wrote instructions for, but when he finishes, goes to anyone else who can secondary his work, even if I'm right next to him, just to ensure he doesn't have to talk to me) 

Is there anything I can do to help the situation? Or is it best left alone? Probably know I shouldn't talk certain topics with him in the future.. ",1,1730477786.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

💙 The state of Oregon doesn't have sales tax.

💙 So many restaurants are closed on Sundays.

💙 Southern Oregon is rural and the options are dismal for gluten-free.

Day 1:

⭐ In-N-Out: they only have fries in their fryer so it's safe for celiacs. I say, "" I have Celiac disease, so gluten allergy in your system."" 

Double-double: 2 hamburger patties, 2 slices of cheese. 
Protein style: lettuce wrapped with no bun.

How I order: ""1 Double double, protein style with grilled onions, gluten allergy. 1 Fries, gluten allergy.""

I order all food for my party as ""gluten allergy"" so they don't get confused on which items are mine. 

⭐ Costco: Got some Black Forest fruit bars for the car / hotel room. $15.99. We took most of these home because it's a huge box.

⭐ Mello Coffee Roasters: ordered a white chocolate granita but couldn't see on the menu board that it was just a blended drink rather than a true granita until I zoomed in with my camera. 16 ounces for $6.25.

Day 2

Not a lot of options before 11 AM and we had to get on down the road to drive to Oregon Caves National Monument so we just went to the grocery store.

⭐ Albertsons Market (grocery store): got a $7.99  premade salad from the refrigerated section and asked for a fork from the deli. Also got some $3.50 Kettle brand Dijon mustard chips for the car / hotel room. We had so many chips leftover we packed them in our luggage to take home.

⭐ The Vine: there was a Yelp app check-in offer for a free non-alcoholic beverage so I got a guava Italian soda. The owner or someone in the family has Celiac so their fried foods are gluten-free. Got gluten-free fried mushrooms for $15 which felt really expensive for what we got. Also got the $24 gluten-free chicken parmesan that came with penne. There was an undisclosed upcharge to make it gluten-free which I thought was annoying.

Day 3

⭐ Starbucks: 30 ounce iced, unsweetened green tea for $4.75 & their gluten-free marshmallow dream bar for $2.50. 

⭐ Mochi Donut House - unlike other mochi donut places, this one is gluten-free. We ordered 6 donuts to-go and took most of them home. I like the pandan (green) one best. The purple one is ube / taro. 

⭐ Hawaiian Hut: They brought their ingredients out so I could check them to make sure there was no gluten in their food. It's just pork + liquid smoke and rice. I was able to make 3 meals out of thie $15 large plate because it was so much food. I added the $2.99 kimchi that I bought from Albertsons earlier in the week because I needed some sauce with flavor in my rice. ",65,1730477706.0,glutenfree,13,0.97,False

I've made about 75 drinks, making grinder setting changes after 50 to see if I can extract more taste. Water temperature changes. Took out the brew group and cleaned it while wiping off some of the lubricant that was out of place. Then ran 30 cups of water using the pre-ground coffee setting through the machine. The taste has never changed. It tastes like I'm drinking colored water that's been passed through the lubricant. No sign of the coffee taste.

I have this electric Bialetti that I got maybe 20 years ago. Still works great, but cleaning around the filter/gasket has gotten bad with what looks like corrosion. I think that it said it was a 6 cup, but I'm not sure. It makes one normal sized cup of coffee. Does anyone know what I could replace the upper half with? Thanks!
