Background: I didn't plan on transferring when I first bought the tickets. An alliance member gave me the idea when he asked how much it was because it reduced his alliance tokens by a large amount. If other people are buying it, maybe I should too? So I've been buying it every week - way before I read the advice that you should always have tickets reserved just in case a state changes overnight.

I had accumulated 11 tickets total. I only needed 6 for my main account (90M, FC2) and 5 tickets for my farm account (50M, F30).

**How I Chose a State**

I looked for a state that has castle rotation, compatible bear time and mainly uses English.

🏰 Castle Rotation - States that share the battle record with other alliances or capable of taking Sunfire Castle. It's a good sign there is a functional NAP in place and multiple alliances are allowed to grow to adequately compete with each other.

🐻 Bear Time - When the game was new, I could justify drinking coffee just to stay up late. However it was untenable over time and found myself moving to an earlier and earlier time slot. I decided that I need to find a state that was more compatible for gaming hours only.

🌎 Language - Communication is integral in the game and from playing in other states, it was easier when most people can communicate in English.

**The State I Transferred to**

I randomly asked state presidents or players what their bear time was. Then I asked other follow up questions about their NAP, requirements in their alliance, and if they have ordinary invites available.

The person I talked to in my new state was a green flag from first chat. He didn't immediately say yes and deferred decision making to his team. He was also prompt in responding to messages. Transparent when there were hiccups. And worked well with another alliance during the recruitment phase. They coordinated with me right before phase 2 opened and sent the invitation immediately after reset. They gave off a reliable and professional first impression.

\---

There were a few weird omens before I joined. Like when I created an account in this state, it warned me that not many people speak in my language. I made a lot of characters in other states and this was the first time I encountered this pop up message.

And a few hours before transferring, I got a war declaration. My alt-account, a level 7 castle with 0 RSS was attacked.

\---

I scouted this state before joining. And like every other there are problems, but I appreciated that I knew about it just from reading their world chat. But what I liked the most about this state is that their people are passionate, sweet and good sports. During SVS week, one player was willing to do everything for his state. And right before transfer, they reached an agreement to behave well for new people joining in.

https://preview.redd.it/5h9i4eyfa02g1.png?width=524&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f1df65ff0a53487d3ac85e4f595e9d30426d94b

They also had a pretty wholesome interaction with their SVS opponent who said:

It was pretty cool to see opposing sides with a similar perspective about the game and had mutual respect for each other. I like the idea that WOS didn't have to be a war game, but played like any other sport where strategy and skill take center stage.

They lost SVS prep but they reached 4 billion points. They scored higher than other winning states I observed. The opposing state crushed it, with a final score of around 4.7B.

After transferring I learned that alliance leaders and whales practice what they preach when they remind people to save for SVS. The events leader board is filled with random players, that even people from small alliances can rank in top 100. I wasn't really looking for a SVS focused state but they seem pretty determined for a win. Luckily, I like a good underdog story.

It's only been a week since I transferred and it's probably too early to make a complete review. But I think it's safe to say that this state has potential and its population is what makes it special.

Overall, I had a pretty smooth transfer experience.",1,1763468525.0,whiteoutsurvival,0,1.0,False
1p0ahsi,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1p0ahsi/my_female_coworker_is_so_rude_to_me_for_no_reason/,My female coworker is so rude to me for no reason,"So I just started my new job (me, 25F) and they placed me with my coworker (25F also) to train me and get me up to speed. 

From day one she has been so cold towards me, here are a few things she’s done:
1. Told me that she reported back to other female coworkers that I’m “normal” and not to worry about me being weird (this happened in the first week of being there, and is so random to even think that’s a normal thing to say to someone)
2. Told me that people usually get fired after 6 months (which I think was a ploy to scare me)
3. Went to a work function in my first week and told me beforehand that I was not allowed to “stick” to her or another colleague the whole night and to leave her alone
4. Told me I couldn’t listen to a group conversation and pulled everyone away from me to talk to them
5. She did not train me in anything for about 3 weeks and when I asked her how to do a task she told me “I’m not the boss of *insert task*”
6. Does not CC in any emails (which was hard because I was meant to be taking over her workload and had no knowledge of running tasks) and told me I must continue to CC her in emails even though she isn’t working on those tasks anymore 
7. Hadn’t invited me to meetings 

I guess I’m just confused on why she acts like this. She framed herself as cold to people, which made me feel like she thought I had to gain her “friendliness” or “respect”. She’s very close with everyone else in our office and chatty etc. inviting them to coffees and skipping me. She was meant to guide me through my first few months here and be a mentor but I genuinely feel like she wants me to fail. I guess I’m wondering how do I navigate this?

TLDR: female coworker constantly wants me to fail and is bluntly rude to me, even though she was appointed to guide me through my first few months at my new job.

Originally she would approach me bother me about how unsafe she feels but would never document or call the police just her saying “we need to get everyone to put complaints in as a group as she dose hand gestures” her way of pulling other tenants into her drama just to deal with it as she pisses off like a roach running. She couldn’t even be bothered to just call the police about the drug dealers she had to manipulate & gaslighting my autism like she’s doing now this time “I’m the problem” yet why is it that she’s the one putting Folgers ground up coffee grinds on her door & in her apartment “to keep the roaches away” when if you bother todo your research let alone basic facts about roaches is that if they can survive nuclear radiation, clearly they’re capable of gaining some form of nutrients from Folgers coffee, but nope she would blame others while manipulating her boyfriends that she isn’t the problem, she’s sent 4 with 2 only bothering me because her first one that she tried to send didn’t want to risk getting deported for his gfs crazy bullshit so he pissed off, she tried to manipulate some single hard working dad with 2 kids all because “she wants kids” so I called his work truck that he showed up with letting his place of work know that I’m not trying to get the employee in trouble but that 1 of their employees is being dragged to bother me at this address dating a women looking like this at this address who socializes with a drug addict in the building who’s banned from communicating with all 3 of his separate baby mommas kids so if he cares about not dealing with cps up his ass he should probably stop dating her because I’m already trying to take his gf to court. 3rd cuck is some guy that looks like a woman who can tell you how he failed to be an OPP or how he has cousins with the OPP & police force to intimidate you but just simply refuse to actually swing but will push you stomp up to your face like they’re going to hit you “provocation & instigation” while being arrogant to think that he can bother you while you’re waiting for the bus to go grocery shopping on your home property isn’t harassment let alone failing to force your way into someone else’s unit door only to run & tell people around the building that I harass women, he’s now gone but now she has a new cucking simp that honestly looks like a pedo with the British dental plan but the American diet plan, she’s persistent in accusing me of harassing women when the only time I’ll leave my unit is to go grocery shopping, going to work & going to my partners place on weekends, the only females aside from my mother & grandmother that I socialize with is my partners mother & sister when I’m over at their place on the weekends meaning the only females I talk to would be the landlord because no shit you’d talk to your landlord about any problems, DSO staff because I’m on disability, grocery store staff because I don’t like self checkout, bank staff pretty sure if I were harassing the latter 2 I’d be banned from their premises with the final female I talk to is part of a non profit employment support company that although I’ve been able to get a job off my own work skills their representative working with me has been able to help me with my autism & process it when it gets overwhelming who of which if I was harassing that lady I’d be banned from their services, I don’t get why Canadian law enforcement is so incompetent when you show them a video of a guy bothering you away from your home after a prior video of him trying to force his way into your home, if this was an American red state I could’ve just shot the home invader & call it a day, literally having to deal with her bs after I’ve been up for 16hrs just got home waiting for my uber eats order from a 12hr shift, she needs to grow up, stop playing the victim card for attention find a man that can accept her crazy mentality & move on, she spent her whole life manipulating men to pamper her, she’s even tried to sue building management twice the first time was when the maintenance staff were going into units so she got the time to get undressed & sit on the couch waiting for them to step in, if you knew they’re coming in to work on your unit, clearly you should be dressed, they don’t just walk into a unit unless the unit owner physically opens the door to let them in so for whatever reason her lawsuit was dropped or flopped to go through, second time was earlier this year “last winter” when she would gather information & “proof” about the roaches in her unit so she can sue building management for cleaning supplies & compensation when several other units had to throw alot of their stuff out because of her coffee experiment, kinda hard to blame building management for the roaches she accumulated in her unit via Folgers coffee everywhere, even after they’ve brought an exterminator in, she needs to gather evidence & make a police report if I’m harassing her not slander me to the city & building tenants just to try & get me evicted.",1,1763468299.0,ola_harassment,0,1.0,False

Super long post incoming but probably will find it cringe as a reader (Bias aside). Also Im not good with women so thats why I give as many details as possible to see if i misunderstood the situation at some point. 
Anyways i just want to get this out of my chest cuz im super disappointed.

Before I get crucified I know that not “all” women are like this but Ive seen/experienced many examples like this one before. For those of you who are actually genuine we “men” appreciate you 🙏. But Im genuinely confused and would love to hear what yall have to say, I welcome any criticism and feedback if you think I made the wrong move somewhere (:

Stories contain me (21yrs old) and these 2 girls whom i will call “R” (Shy) and “B” (More talkative) respectfully who are besties and have been flirting with me for weeks… 

I will start from the beginning so you are fully informed before you judge, and list all the points with numbers where i think either of them flirted with me. Argument will get stronger as story goes on so dont judge solely from the early stages. 

**Story 1 might be a bit boring so skip to 4 and 5 but you wont get the full picture**

Been working in a mall for a while now and there’s this coffee shop where R and B work. I’ve noticed R 1-2 months ago and immediately thought that she is absolutely stunning but didn’t want to make an immediate move, especially not while she is on-duty cuz i didnt want to put her in an awkward spot in case she wanted to reject me. As for B… Im simply not interested in her cuz i chose R right? Just want to get that out of the way.
So i would go there get my coffee and suffer in silence cuz i didnt know how to approach her. Her beauty killed me to the point where i didn’t eat nor sleep. So I started praying to God and told him that this feeling is unbearable and asked him to send me a sign if it is meant to be.

Then i saw her on a Thursday night with one guy so i thought that she has a boyfriend and that i have no chance and this is my “No” from God but turns out he wasnt (Somebody told me 100% true). Anyways I was talking to my coworkers opposite of them and that guy but she kept looking at me for like 20 minutes… totally not interested in what the other guy was saying and probably drooled a bit haha. Then i left and suddenly they switched tables **(Coincidence? Why switch?)** On my way back she pretended to look at the phone but as i walked by she checked me out top to bottom, so then i did it again and SHE CHECKED ME TOP TO BOTTOM AGAIN but pretended like she didnt look at all.

**Story 1:**

Believe it or not next time I went R started asking “Oh your favourite again?” (This I know… it may not have been a flirt) then “So you are doing a lap again and will come back?” (I always did 1 lap around, how does she even know this?). Something sparked but i didnt take it too seriously cuz its part of their job.

**Story2:**

B comes into play here. **Mind you B has NEVER EVER EVER looked at me before, never talked to me, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING before i started getting drinks from R**. So one day R (turned with her back) and B (facing me) sit on one of the tables for hours. Every time I pass by (3-5 meters away) their table (part of my job) B checks me out but we dont make eye contact and R smirks and whispers something to her.

(I think this was a flirt) 

When the crowd goes away B OUT OF NOWHERE yells “How was your day” aiming to get my attention obviously (SHE HAD NEVER TALKED TO ME BEFORE) so i go there and me and her have a little chitchat while R is listening staying sideways with me. B did not want me to go away and she tried to prolong the convo but I was forced to go eventually cuz of the supervisors.

In this brief moment R was serious and I turned my back for a split second but as I turned back again to  face them i saw her jump a little while making some gestures (You know like when girls have a crush on someone that type of gesture) with her hands and also laughing but immediately stopped when she noticed that i saw her do that and turned her back again **(Surely they were talking about me before that? Sitting there when there are a billion other cafes? Why my area? B was checking me out every time i passed too. AND INITIATES CONVERSATION OUT OF NOWHERE??)**

**But lets say they didnt check me out and they were laughing about something else and im totally overthinking + biased just because i liked her.**

Story 3: 

Same day as story 2 but now R and B left (Or thats what i thought) Im done with my shift just before the shops close and I go on the upper level to grab something on my way out when i saw R coming my way with another girl. No one else in the hall. We noticed each other from like 30m away and kept closing the gap, when we got to the passing point she gave me THE MOST BEAUTIFUL FLIRTATIOUS SMILE IVE EVER SEEN THEN RAISED HER EYES AND BIT HER LIPS. IT FELT LIKE A DREAM. That smile when you want to say “I want you so bad” it was that type of smile. She caught me off guard and i smiled back at her just a bit but we didnt say a word. 
**Why would she do that if she is not interested in me? Surely this is my green light to shoot my shot RIGHT????**

**Story 4:**

Part 1

3-4 days go by and I hadnt seen either of them. Until I did. They both popped up, this time R working and B sitting on bar for hours again… waiting for R to finish from work. No interaction between me and R while B does anything but sit straight any time i get near the shop (I could see her from distance but she couldnt see me). **Crawling on the tables, twisting, stretching… anything to get my attention, and once i slowed down she would start rolling her eyes in a flirty way, playing with her hair, biting her lips bla bla.** Now you may say “Oh she was just bored “ but you dont bite your lips any time someone comes and give them the “fuck me” look. 

I found it funny for a bit but tried to play it as friendly as possible and just smiled a bit then found an excuse to leave every time since obviously i wasn’t interested in her. **But deep down i sensed something awkward incoming **

Part 2

Same day, couple of hours later. Shops close down and I just wait for the clock to run so i can go home and i noticed R and B leaving together. Nothing. Then half an hour later i see them coming down from the top hugging each other while i was drinking water COMPLETELY ISOLATED. We make eye contact and B waves at me, I was surprised so i waved back and then R tried to put her hand down. They started laughing loudly and got messy so they shoved each other in the door next to them therefore we didnt talk.
** Why the hell would they wave and laugh if NEITHER is interested in me?

**Story 5 and PLOT TWIST**

At this point i was tired. I was ready to ask her out but never saw her off-duty and didn’t want to do it while she is working cuz its gonna put her in an awkward spot in front of her boss. 

So I promised myself to be patient and simply prayed that one day I somehow see her. I wrote down my number on a paper and carried it for days in my pockets hoping that some miracle happens. A week goes by and I started to lose hope, even my friend told me how do you wait for her to come out on her day off when she never does it? I started to lose hope and thought that this was the nail in the coffin from God and that i should move on. 

10 minutes before my shift ends, shops completely empty. I see R and B eating by themselves in like 500 tables in the court. What are the odds??? THIS IS MY MOMENT. I grab the paper and approached them saying excuse me ladies but this is for your and i hand over the note to R. B immediately knew whats up and she GOT REALLY SOUR and DEAD SERIOUS. 

B: Are you serious? Can i ask you something? How old r u? (Her tone was so serious, creeped out like im 53 and not 21)

Me: Im 21

B: Do you know how old she is? 

Me: No

R: **We are both 16**

THIS BITCH CALLED B GAVE ME THE “I WANNA PULL YOUR PANTS DOWN” LOOK FOR DAYS AND NOW HAS THE AUDACITY TO BE WORRIED THAT IM TOO OLD???????????!!?!?!!!!

At that point i wanted to die on the spot i swear. I got so embarrassed. THEY WERE 16????? NO WAY BOTH OF THEM LOOK 18-20 WHAAAAAT. I stuttered and didnt know what to say. I barely mumbled “Im really sorry i didnt know that, throw the note in the bin” and immediately left. Then on my way out i stopped again and said “im so sorry” and left for good.

**Conclusion**

Im really embarrassed. This is such an awful day. After months of praying and pain everything falls into pieces just when i thought I made it. Now i feel like R is going to spread the word and completely ruin my reputation everywhere… I will be seen as a creep or a pedo. My apologies didnt seem to affect her and im trembling right now.

**Now back to the main topic. Why did they flirt with me if they were not interested?**

If you made it here… thank you for your time 🙏

And how did you move on?","Hey, I’m going to try and keep it short, I m27 met my person f28 thru my best friend he is dating her sister, I right away I liked her, it was 2 years of hot and cold, where nothing happened she would appear in my life or I’ll seek her and we would hang out and after she realized I liked her she would disappear, to which I later found out by her telling me was cuz she had flings and going back to her ex, once I moved on she randomly appeared again by text, she would always breadcrumb thru the 2 years, but this time she texted me and made plans we met and I felt a shift in energy. Long story short we entered a hook up/casual relationship, but quickly it became her coming over for days and sleeping over and daily contact and what seemed like a “relationship”. I met her parents she asked me if I could fall in love with her and kept telling me how great I am. This lasted 3 months. Right after her birthday she received a gift basket from her ex and she showed me. I took it a sign of trust, but very quickly her energy changed and she became distant and would still come over and communicate thru text but no more intimacy (also starting birth control,so I excused it as hormonal changes) She went to Hawaii with her family and came back a different person, a week of hanging out few times but super distant like never before, I asked if she thought the birth control was messing up with her body. She lashed out and discarded me mind you a day after I lost my job, I was so emotional I begged and cried (not ashamed as she my first and I really cared for her) she had no expression. She told me it was final and we will never see each other again. She left 4 hours later text me to ask how I was feeling, I went nc right away a week later she texted me she wanted to talk about the breakup. We met for coffee she came extremely put together even wearing jewelry I bought her. She apologize and she she felt horrible how things end, but to add salt to my wound she told me she wasn’t ready for a relationship and offered me fwb because she wants me in her life, and that I was an awesome and fun person she still wanted to experience sex and adventures with me, but she wanted to enjoy her 20s and be free to date for experiences and maybe hook up with others too, she also told me after we broke up she went to see her ex “nothing happened “ just she needed soup, which her sister told me the day she asked her also if she could take her to get soup but she couldn’t. I was hurt and I said I would tried it out (to keep her in my life) but as soon as I got home I texted her that I wasn’t interested in that deal and wish her the best. I blocked her on everything so she can’t contact me anymore and I could heal. 

I just would like to know what you guys think or similar experiences and how you guys are doing now.

1p0acrr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p0acrr,Looking for suggestions on a cute coffee nook.,"My wife's Keurig, Mr. Coffee, Nespresso frother, and organizers for K-Cups, sweeteners, and tea bags are piled up in our limited kitchen space and she's not a fan of the setup.

Meanwhile, we have this breakfast nook. I tried setting a table for two there but it interfered with access to the backyard, and there's an open dining room immediately next to it. My hope is to put a bar table facing the window with some space for sitting, but also a nice way to organize all the coffee equipment.

Here's a picture of it in its current unused glory, along with measurements of the awkward space and my rough idea so far.

It sounded pretty much the same but then after about 12 seconds it stopped and discharged into the drip tray.

I’ve had this happen a few times before so I’ve reset the machine and the shots and I check that when I run a double shot without coffee in that it runs for the same length of time and this time it was doing that too so I tried to pull another shot but it wouldn’t go through again. After repeating this numerous times but with no luck I ground the coffee much coarser and it did go through but splattering everywhere. So I made it finer again by about 5 closer to the original grind size I use (I use a df54 and was usually at about 12 so took it to 20 and then back to 15). This time it struggled a bit but pushed through and splattered the espresso out lots with lots of squirts going everywhere. But then I took it back down to the normal size and it wouldn’t push through again.

I’m honestly so lost and frustrated at this I spent an hour this morning trying to fix it so would appreciate any suggestions. I’ve wasted so much coffee and I’m just dumbfounded what to do. I don’t get how everything was fine  but then after cleaning the machine just can’t pull espresso anymore.

1p0aafa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1p0aafa/so_confused_about_my_first_autism_assessment/,So confused about my first autism assessment,"Sorry in advance for the long post, I’m really looking for clarity!

I just had the first part of my autism assessment, mostly activity based and over Zoom, and my mind is racing with overthinking about the questions, what they meant, and how I responded. I left feeling confused and like I had failed some kind of test. I’m hoping someone with experience can shed light on the purpose of these exercises.

Activity 1: She asked me to find five objects nearby and make up a story. I went completely blank. I put my daughter’s hairbrush on a coaster and said it could be a boat, but I didn’t know what to do with the other items (a fidget spinner, a controller, and a plant). I kept apologizing and saying “I can’t think of anything” until she said we could drop the task and move on.

Activity 2: She asked me to imagine she came to my house to make me coffee and I had to tell her how. I just explained exactly how I make my coffee, the syrup, what spoon, how to use the Aeropress, and the order I do things but I’m not sure what this was testing.

Activity 3: A wordless storybook. She started telling a story about a boy who fell asleep reading and asked me to continue based on the pictures. I drew a blank again and just described what I saw on each page. On one page, the boy was riding a pig so I said “he’s riding a pig instead of a horse”. When the assessor asked what “when pigs fly” meant, I explained the phrase. I asked a few times in the storybook one if I was doing it wrong, and she said it didn’t matter, that I could interpret it however I wanted.

Activity 4: A picture task. I said I saw an island. She asked if I’d want to go, and I said no because it looks very busy. She asked about holidays, and I explained that as an adult I mostly do UK road trips to caravan parks because I don’t like flying or public transport. She asked where I’d go if I could travel anywhere, and I said by car to somewhere remote with nice views and walks. She asked what I do when I get there, and I said unpack, figuring out where things are, and plan the days.

Then she said, “I have some places I’d like to go,” and stopped talking. I waited but she didn’t elaborate, so I asked where. She explained where, then repeated the same pattern with “I have another place I’d like to go” with a pause. It felt so awkward and I’m sure it was some kind of test but I can’t tell what the test was other than making it feel very uncomfortable for a minute lol. 

I know I’m overthinking, but I’d love clarity on what these exercises were meant to assess. Thanks so much!

1p0a5v5,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1p0a5v5/dont_add_humans_to_the_hive_mind/,Don't add humans to the hive mind,"The door to the Captain's ready room opened, allowing the sounds of the bridge to disturb the silence. Not the usual quiet hum of competence of the crew performing their duties and conversing. Instead a monotone chanting filled the air. Voices that had, until recently, never attempted to carry a tune were trying to hit the A5 note while ""singing"" about precious metals and failing dismally. Captain Iskel felt the feathers around their aural orifices lift in an involuntary reaction from the sounds as the Navigator slipped inside. 

""That's new"" Iskel croaked out. ""New and bad. So bad my implant can't handle the translation. What fresh hell is this, Sam?""

""Still trying to figure it out, Captain. We think it's another older one from Earth's pre-space days, but the computer is refusing to do a search. Diagnostics indicate that the firewalls have shut down it's microphones in self defence. Still, I think it's better than the growling they were trying before.""

""Would that we could all do the same! Has anyone been down to ask her?""

""No Captain. Last time we did the coffee machine caught fire and we had to switch instant. Then we discovered the hard way that all the instant was decaff. Camilla nearly put Dal-Bin-Gad through the air lock. We had to break out the emergency Monster.""

Iskel shuddered. ""Right, yes. Sensible decision. The last thing we want is the food dispensers to only give out that yeast extract again."" 

They paused, both Brind and Human glancing up at a ceiling and hoping nobody and nothing was listening. ""Has anyone managed to get to the bottom of what's happened to the Muratexians?""

""We've been reviewing the footage, Captain. The Muratexian science hive came aboard at the Delphis VIII spaceport, as contracted. They set up in the three quarters assigned to them. One hour after departure we signalled to all passengers that they could leave their quarters for the rest of the voyage. The standard interface hive interface delegation left their cabin and met with our Murataxian Eng-hive crew. They performed the usual data exchange between the distributed hives, then went off to greet the rest of the passengers.""

""I've always liked that. The Muratexians know some find hive minds difficult and they go out of their way to explain themselves and integrate. More could learn from that example. A science hive though? Sam, I have a bad feeling about that.""

""You're right to, Captain. This science hive has been travelling -""

The Navigator paused as a service hatch opened. A cleaning robot rolled out and both eyed it warily. Instead of the usual black sides it had been painted in blue, pink and white, and a stuffed shark had been stuck to the top. Both lifted their legs up to their chairs, waiting. After a few moments the robot rolled back in to its compartment and the hatch closed.

Iskel sighed and rolled her complex double shoulder joints. ""I see it's spread to the facilities hive. At least this one didn't have a knife attached. We all found the 'Robotic Conflict' videos amusing, but I didn't think they might take it this far. Then again, I'm not even surprised at this point. Please continue your report""

""Ok, Captain. The science hive. They're out trying to get more understanding of the species around them. They have a piece of equipment that, when properly calibrated, can temporarily integrate someone of another species with the hive. They say it has no lasting effects on the individuals and the hive is enriched by the knowledge. That was all on the manifest."" Iskel moved a wing in a ""carry on"" gesture the crew knew well. ""We can see from security that some of our other passengers volunteered for the integration. It's just a simple headset and only lasts for a couple of minutes. All who tried it sat quietly for a couple of minutes, then just got up and walked away. The computer was able to identify contentment displays in 4 out of 5 individuals, and no marked changes in behaviour in the Muratexian science hive. They had, so far as we can tell, kept limited contact with the crew hives to not interfere with their duties.""

""So how did our Engineer get involved? I know she feels a bond with them - one of the first things she did when she came aboard was to give one of the Eng-hive a hug!"" Iskel barely suppressed a shudder.

""Our Eng-hive brought her to the science hive. She was working on a side project -""

The Captain interrupted ""Which one?""

""The plasma nozzle configuration with Dal-Bin-Gad. Reviewing her work showed that she had done the initial calculations, then realised with a few more tweaks she could get the exhaust to change colour on command. She hadn't looked at the issue with the third harmonic wearing the gyrators yet.""

""Ok, I'll redirect her focus next time I speak with her. At least it's not something totally new. So I take it she tried out this integration thingymabob? And two minutes exposure to a human mind did this?""

""Not quite Captain. She's still wearing it and is fully integrated with the hive - all the hives, Captain. The change has been... Remarkable. That plasma nozzle issue? Done and Dal-Bin-Gad tells me that wear has been reduced by 35% instead of the projected 4%. The power conduits, the little figures she was painting, auxillary light circuits - done.""

""So what is she doing now?""

""She's in Engineering. The pickups caught her muttering about the spares being in the wrong order and she's organising it all.""

""Hopefully she'll finish this time. It took us weeks to get her to put it all back before when she got distracted by Raiders of the Lost Imperium. Some of the hive activities I can understand now. The music, modifying the cleaning bots and reading all the information in the ships library make sense. They're things we all know about our Engineer. Why though did the science hive refer to the Eng-hive as 'him' yesterday, and then at breakfast today as 'her'? Then eng-hive and facilities hive have been doing the same. Muratexian workers are completely sexless! And why are they wearing clothes?""

""Captain, you could ask five humans that question and get seven different answers. I think the Muratexians are exploring new ideas after being exposed to them in a way they can finally comprehend. They work hard at communicating with us using our methods, but no other species in the galaxy has the kind of telepathy they do and we know many concepts beyond science and mathematics where rules have to be intuited haven't translated well.""

"" All right. We get to Muratex in two more ship days, then we can drop of the science hive with their contraption and everything can go back to normal.""",3,1763467485.0,HFY,3,0.8,False

Still, you live in *society*. Society feels like the highest life form; it can shape our minds however it wants. Beauty standards, living standards, even personality. All of these things are influenced by society.

Apparently, there’s no deity or higher being who can judge you except society. It’s the one that shapes, criticizes, and judges you according to its own standards. So if you happen not to fit those standards, even if it wasn’t your choice, you’re out.

1p0a0bc,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDers/comments/1p0a0bc/rantscream_into_the_void/,Rant/Scream Into the Void,"Hi.

Consider this post my 'scream into the void' or whatever ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

I'm sorry if this is against the rules to post (I don't think it is?) or if it's too 'complainy' for some. This is just me venting about my own experience having ADHD/Autism. I just don't really have anyone to talk to about this; none of my friends or family know how badly I suffer from ADHD/Autism, and I don't think they'd understand. I also don't want to be a burden to anyone. I’m not looking for sympathy or anything like that, either. I just needed a place to put these thoughts, so here I am!

Further disclaimer: I’m definitely not trying to stereotype anything, and I'm sorry if this post might offend you for whatever reason. I'm also not trying to define the whole 'community' of people with ADHD/Autism; we all have different brains and different struggles :)

Finally getting an ADHD diagnosis as an adult was like a dream come true! Getting put on medication was even better! The difference in my attention-span and my mental clarity ON/OFF the meds is insane! But when the meds wear off I'm left sitting there frustrated at how massive the gap between medicated-me and unmedicated-me is.

Another thing... now that I'm on medication I feel like my brain is 'quiet' enough to allow me to notice all the 'weird' behaviours that I exhibit on a day-to-day basis and that's making me feel so hopeless about the future ...

Just to be clear, I don't want any of this to sound like I'm using ADHD or Autism as a 'get-out-of-jail-free card' or anything ... I hate the idea of excusing myself by virtue of a diagnosis. I feel like there will never be any progress if I do that. I know that my actions have consequences. I want to understand myself well enough that I can fix (IDEK if 'fixing' myself is possible at this point) / mitigate my symptoms as far as possible.

\[Any sort of\] a relationship coming to fruition is incredibly difficult, and leaves me exhausted most of the time. Once I obtain that relationship, sustaining it is just as tiring, if not more so. It feels like I've got this switch in me that takes me from wanting connection more than anything and wanting to be left completely alone.

I'm not exclusively referring to romantic relationships, although those are definitely impacted ...  I feel like I get attached to people very easily, but also get bored of them very easily. That sounds terrible, is terrible, and I feel terrible for it. It makes me question the legitimacy of my relationships sometimes.

Every REAL romantic relationship I've ever had has involved the other person cheating on me. Granted, that's only two relationships, but they were both long-term and committed relationships. I'm at the point now where I think, if by some miracle someone is deluded enough to believe that they might actually be interested in me (beyond sexually), they'll eventually realise that what they felt was only a brief infatuation brought about by a perceived 'quirkiness' symptomatic of my ADHD/Autism, OR I'll convince myself of that and push them away, OR I'll get 'bored' and hurt them. 

My brain feels like its the Millennium Falcon and its stuck constantly travelling at the speed of light and my thoughts are like the stars flying towards me. In social situations I feel like I'm playing an RPG and loads of different dialogue options are throwing themselves at me and its so so so difficult to choose the right one. Everything moves so fast that nothing ever really feels truly stable. 

I'm so afraid of letting my ADHD symptoms flow out and appearing 'weird' that sometimes I end up leaving conversations, etc. thinking 'wtf?! whyyyy the f\*\*\* would you do that? you're so weird; they think you’re so weird'. 

I'm constantly overanalysing the other person/people ... their body language, the tone of their voice, where they're looking, etc. Meanwhile my dumpster fire of a working memory is fighting for its life, trying to keep track of the conversation... It's exhausting and it makes me feel like I'm malfunctioning.

None of what's in this post is ever expressed by me in real life (hence the burner-account). On the outside (I think) I come across as confident, smart, outgoing, and put-together. But on the inside, most of my energy is going towards analysing absolutely everything and inhibiting my 'weird' behaviours. People that I might meet when ordering coffee, getting drinks, etc. might think I'm a bit strange, but I think overall I do an OK job at masking. But its so exhausting and really I just want to be able to rest. It feels embarrassing but I so badly want to be accepted for who I am, even though I don't fully accept 'me'.

I realised with my psych a while back that when I was younger and living with my family I would inhibit my personality to the point of depression. Any time I was 'myself' I'd be criticised, called names or mocked, and told to stop acting like a child/grow up. Well I have grown up, but I still feel like a child in some ways. I think that experience stuck with me and is part of what's given me such a terrible self-image. I've never been able to truly be 'me'. But I don't know if I even want to be 'me', because I know just how dysfunctional 'me' is.

Despite what I've just said about not wanting to be 'me', I think if it were possible to be 'me' without the negative consequences, I would love to be 'me'... Does that make sense?? I want to be vulnerable without the overwhelming fear that I'm exposing some kind of defective core / person. I want to not feel the need to inhibit my actions and monitor everything I do. I want someone to understand me and I want to know that its okay to be an unsure mess who struggles to navigate himself.

My struggles aren't confined to relationships/social situations, either. **I try so, so hard to succeed** ... to keep up with others and to go beyond them and stand out if I can. But I feel like my brain is always tripping me right before the finish line. 

I'm in university at the moment, and this year should have been my last. Unfortunately, due to my faults, I'll have to do another semester (at least) before I am able to graduate. It's gotten so bad that last semester I was so late to one of my exams that when I arrived I only had half of the time left to complete the thing. I had spent COUNTLESS hours studying for that exam (up to 10 hours a day) and I threw it all away by being a disorganised f\*\*\*-up. I wasted over 3 months of intense study by severely underestimating how long it would take me to organise myself for the exam/actually travel to the exam.

Sometimes I feel so different from 'normal' people that it's almost like I'm not really HERE with them. It's like I'm some little green alien dude sat in his invisible spaceship hovering just above the world looking down at all the 'normal people' living normally, dealing with REAL problems while I study them; feeling envious of how they seem to just 'know' the rules of being human, and hating much harder it is for me back on Planet Bloop-Blarp to live/socialise. I feel alien, almost literally ... like I don't fit in this world the same as everyone else, like I'm always out of sync, too late to the plate, always \*almost\* there but never quite able to make it.

I truly, truly envy the ability of (most) 'normal' people to go about their day-to-day lives (obviously I recognise that everyone has their own problems, I'm not saying they don't have any or that their lives are necessarily 'easy').

Everyone else (I say 'everyone else' because most people I know / interact with are 'normal') seems to move through life so naturally. They talk, they laugh, they CONNECT, all seemingly without thinking. Then there I am, in the same space, doing my best to appear the same but internally melting. I literally feel like I'm in some sort of a disguise most of the time.

I had an appointment with my psych for the first time in a long time this week because I woke up to a panic attack a couple of weeks ago as a result of feeling like if I don't get my s\*\*\* together I'll never complete university, never get a good job, never find love, and I'll end up murdering any remaining relationships I've got that I haven't already throttled by virtue of my forgetfulness, inattentiveness, etc. Having that meeting is what 'inspired' me to write this, I guess. Ever since that meeting my thoughts have been swirling and I struggle so badly to organise them. My psychiatrist says I've got a form of 'emotional blindness' (Alexithymia), which is also SUPER helpful when trying to work through my issues (kidding, it takes me f\*\*\*n forever to articulate my feelings). 

I'm not even sure if what I've said makes sense; I just wanted to put it out there.

For the record, I've got another appt. with my psych soon and they've got a few ideas on things that might help me :) Maybe one day I'll be able to land my spaceship and be able to assimilate with da humans 👽

1p09w7u,https://www.reddit.com/r/byler/comments/1p09w7u/how_wills_romantic_plot_should_have_been_written/,How Will's romantic plot should have been written if Byler wasn't endgame. Keeping most of season storyline 4 intact.,"Thi is just a random yap post. But if byler isn't endgame, they should have written the plot for Will like the one I will get into in a minute. This suppose to be Will's season and if he is the one who ends up without love or a mid ass epilogue boyfriend, it's just bad writing. Atleast should have cleared the whole byler plot in middle of season 4.

This is how it should have gone. The van scene should have happened after they had buried the detective's body. Mike should have realised Will likes him and should have been weirded out and rejected him in a awkward way. They should not have talked properly after that. 
Then, they return to Hawkins in the end, we should have gotten an ending scene of Will meeting up his potential love interest somewhere and that should have been it.

They should have introduced a new character during the ending of S4. Then in season 5, the plot could have gone like: Will is trying to move on from Mike but is also in immense suffering and basically hates himself. He bonds with this new guy xyz over their shared interests and past traumas, (excluding the UD talks). Robin and Will become friends. Xyz notices Will is acting off, gets worried and follows Will to see what is up with him, accidentally overhears the whole UD thing, confronts the party in a very S1 Steve Harrington way and yk just joins them casually at first and then slowly becomes an integral part by the end lol. They have their deep talks. Heart to heart with each other. Mike is distant and away like he has always been after the rejection and low-key behaves in a very conservative way. Will realises how much of a jerk and conservative/homophobic Mike was in season 3 and 4 (bcuz if byler isn't going to be canon, Mike is just a shitty badly written character.)

We actually get to see spark and built up tension between Will and the new guy. Lingering glances, subtle soft touches, them looking at each other's lips for over an appropriate time, catching each other peeking at times, freaking and crashing out over it and low-key just both of them being a big gay mess. Then Vecna starts tormenting Will by hallucinations and stuff. Then the whole Vecna plot happens while this new boy gets spiralled into the upside down lore and it turns out he is actually a f*cking badass and he protects Will obviously. Mike is not needed anymore. We see both Mike and the new guy trying to protect Will and only the new guy is able to. Idc about Mileven by that point bcuz Mike is written to be unlikable.

Then good love confession happens from the guy's side when Will desperately needs it and they need to make Will believe he is loved. And then the plot things happen. Will is able to fight Vecna with this newfound security and reliability and self acceptance. And boom, a story. It all ties up perfectly. Will being the main character, Mike being a straight conservative dude, Will's new love interest being effing iconic and lovable. Mike apologising in an awkward way and Will being so done with him. Also, they try to make their friendship work but they are just too different now. Will distances himself from Mike. And the old close friends dynamic between them is slowly fading into the background as he looks up from his coffee to see his lover smiling at him from across the table, drinking his coffee and putting sause on pancakes as they share a beautiful silent moment together. The end. 

This just would have made sense in my head if byler wasn't written to be canon. 
This is how you write an acceptable queer plot. With all the built up, acceptance and happy ending. I am just giving a brief explanation, the actual story would have been much more nuanced, intricate and emotionally moving obviously.

We recently moved into a new apartment together and had FMIL come visit last week (she lives across the country). It was agreed upon that she would stay in a hotel since we live in a very cramped apartment with no extra space. She “forgot” this and there was a long back and forth with her wanting us to buy a guest bed (despite there being no space for it) before she finally agreed to stay in a hotel like originally agreed upon. The reason I use quotation marks is because she always seems to “forget” things she doesn’t like. (My boyfriend however believes she genuinely forgets.) This is one of the rare occasions she has accepted a “no”: my boyfriend always has to make up some elaborate excuse to get her to back off because he knows a no isn’t enough. 

During the visit FMIL would make these comments that I’m not sure were just lost in translation (she isn’t a native speaker of our language) or were genuinely meant like how she said it. “Now that you live in [boyfriend]’s apartment..” “[boyfriend]’s coffee machine” etc. small comments that didn’t happen often but that made me side eye her a bit because uhm it’s also my apartment and coffee machine?

Another thing that I noticed was that she never says thank you or please. Not once did she utter those words to me or to anyone. I have listened to her and my boyfriend on the phone many times: my boyfriend is the “fixer”, she is always calling him having him fix something or the other for her (we are trying to put in place boundaries re phone calls but it is hard and slow going). And she never says thank you, no matter how many hours he spends helping her. It’s always do this do that. I find this kind of sad for my boyfriend, and not to mention rude. 

My boyfriend is the oldest son of a single mother and I see a lot of parallels between his role in his family and my own father’s role in my (traditional) family and it honestly makes me very uncomfortable and unsure how to navigate. FMIL treats my boyfriend like this, while treating her youngest son (early twenties) like he is a toddler. She wanted us to essentially babysit him last summer while she was away for a week. She also almost exclusively talks about him. BIL is doing this, BIL is doing that. It was disheartening listening to her go deep into detail about his life, while she didn’t know or seem to care about some very basic aspects of my boyfriend’s life. She also has zero interest in me which I guess isn’t necessarily a bad thing. 


Am I overthinking this? There are a lot more details I could include but the post is already a bit long. I hope this post doesn’t come across as petty, I am mostly concerned about FMIL’s relationship to my boyfriend.

1p09qk2,https://coffeecornermotorsport.com/las-vegas-gp-2025-tyre-preview/,Las Vegas GP 2025: Tyre Strategy Outlook for Fantasy Team Picks,"Hey everyone, Terry here from Coffee Corner Motorsport. Back again with another quick tyre strategy rundown for anyone setting up Fantasy teams before the Las Vegas weekend kicks off.

If you caught my last post, you’ll know I focus on tyres, strategy, and weekend trends. If you’re new, welcome. I try to keep these guides simple, factual and actually helpful for Fantasy calls.

Pirelli stay with the C3, C4 and C5 for Vegas this year. The surface runs cold, the grip is low and warm-up tends to decide everything. The Medium can be quick if drivers keep it clean early. If they slide, it grains. The Hard is usually the safer race tyre once the temperatures settle.

Warm-up is the headline.  
Session temps sit around twelve to fourteen degrees. Out laps define qualifying here. Push too hard early and the fronts drop out of the window before the lap even starts. Wear stays low, so strategy leans toward a controlled two-stop unless the track rubbers in faster than expected.

**What this means for Fantasy picks:**  
• Mercedes often handle low-grip surfaces well. If they find the window, they move up.  
• Ferrari have the straight-line speed for the Strip. Their race depends on front tyre life.  
• Red Bull fight at the front if they nail warm-up on Friday. If not, they fall into traffic.  
• McLaren usually lose time in cold prep laps. They will need a clean weekend.  
• Midfield surprises tend to come from cars that build tyre energy early. Williams, Haas and RB can all qualify well here.

If you want the full compound breakdown and strategy notes, the complete Vegas tyre preview is now live on Coffee Corner Motorsport.

I spawned in right next to Reinforced Reception at 29:40. Bolted into the reception, Matriarch sitting just outside the door. Decided to just dive into the reception and see what happens, ignoring the Matriarch and the impending doom that would be bestowed upon her.

The first 3 containers dropped this, the Vita Shot BP and the MK3 Blueprint even dropped in the same container.

I have never YEETED out of a map this fast in my life.

Welcome to my school,
here is a SHORT brief of 6th form life

#GENERAL 6th Form stuff

No talking  at all during Frees (study periods they are classed as the same thing- so we technically get 0 frees)

Not allowed on our phones during frees

I am fine with theses two rules, they make sense, & esp since we only have 13 a fortnight we need that time

My issues is the teachers who enforce the rules break them- constantly

talk at LOUD volumes to each other-- all the time- often about NON-SCHOOL related stuff

also

We get in BIG trouble of we forget our fob pass (how we sign in & out of school- we can do it via reception Or 6th form reception anyway) 

They can just close our toilets... like if they are left in bad condition 6th formers just wont get a toilet (make sense to some extent)

If head of 6th form thinks we've been vaping- we are out of the school- he neeeds NO proof- he will just kick us out

Head of year 12 doesn't care about our mental health...at alll Screamed at me when i was already upset... because I didn't tell her what was wrong... even though i was like ""i don't know'-- In public- where loads of ppl were working past

They mad at me for sitting in an English classroom... at lunch...to eat... and work... despite it being okay for the past 5 years... where the Teacher is okay we me sitting in there...

I now have to sit in the 6th form block... it can fit around 130 people... there is 270 people in 6thform....(not everyones sit in there but it is packed- this is also the only time ppl can sepak in their- it gets LOUD... I am autsitic-- noise sensitivity is my biggest trigger... as well as smell... it drives me insane....)

so i don't eat... like so i eat breakfast at 6:45-7am- walk to school. at 7:30 get there at 8, have the day at school- possible go rehearsal, get home then eat again. No rehearsal- 4pm Rehearsal- 5-5:30pm

so like 9-10 hours no eating.... 2 mile walk to school

i eat around 1,100-1,400 callories a day... not enough......

I have a few health issues so i need to make sure i am eating enough, to get the correct diagnosis... if i am not eating. doctors will blame it all on that... when i know there is somthing else

*are frees/study periods are they same thing there is no difference between them- I supose if we leave the school we could talk- but inside the block silence

________________________________________________________________________________

- They make us start off with 5 A levels ( Can drop 1 in yr 12, but they prefer us to finish year 12 and get the As first- so still 3 A levels + 1 mandatory- (in special & rare circumstances ppl can drop 2... (2+ 1 mandatory)

Mandatory A level- Welsh baccalaureate-

If we don't pass it in year 12- they wont let us return next year 😅

so we will have to find another school for Year 13

I have no idea how our subjects would match options blocks would work in other schools

We have to come in for form/tutor every day (11:55-12:15) we still have assembly once a week

CLOTHING 

We have a uniform - same as other years (different colour jumper and new tie which is like 4ft long). We also have an optional blazer... No one wared that

(I don't care about uniform- I prefer it but some ppl hate having it)

Like other years we can't where any jumper/hoddy in school (exept school jumper)

JEWELRY

Piercings: Only allowed ONE. Stud in Ear LOBE- No hoops, No other body piecing's (even other ear/nose) (my friend got her hoops confiscated)

ONE ring. ONE Neckless and it CAN'T be on show- has to be hidden under jumper

Idk if people can have their nails done like in acrylic/tips or whatever in 6th form not allowed yr7-Yr11.

three years ago  no one was even allowed basic nail polish, 

They also used to be strict on hair dye- but not anymore

GENERAL SCHOOL

Many Pedo teachers. 1 arrested, 1 fired (6th former- 18 & concenting- but breached poilcey,) Sub- watching henti, Sub- looked under skirt in drama (sits on chair and leans back..) SUB- somthing less idk

Rats... alive...dead...Everywhere

Mold... covered in mold, they just paint over it (classroom unteachable- but we still have to go in their- STINKS!!!)

An english teacher with 'issuess...' who used my already really bad mental state, against me...(i have a whole list 😅)

However:
They also used to be strict on hair dye - but not anymore

Make up rules also relaxed more (used to be allowed basic foundation to 'cover blemishes')

we are allowed to go hope during frees now (used to be just yr 13- now yr 12 can)

if lessons end before the allocated time we can go early

we can go on our phones... ONLY in the 6th form area though at break or Lunch ONLY

We do have a cafe to get coffee/tea/hot chocolate/cake (sometimes) but it closes mid day-

so still lucky i guess???

________________________________________________________

I am honestly considering leaving

- I can't take it anymore

- i don't really have any actual friends

- i am alone all the time

- there isnt anything i will get out of it

Apologies for the long post but I posted something similar a few days ago that received a lot of traffic and so I wanted to post the fully revised version for those of you who wanted it for themselves. Here is a travel policy for a nanny who will travel with families:


Travel Expectations & Compensation Policy

General Travel Standards

• All lodging, meals, excursions, tickets, transportation, and activities attended with the family
are fully covered.
• All meals are covered even during off-duty hours and on paid rest days.
• The nanny is provided a private bedroom and private bathroom, separate from the children.
• Maximum working limit while traveling is up to 12 hours of on-duty time per day.
• Any excursion, outing, or activity the nanny attends with the family counts as on-duty time.
• International travel is permitted, but the nanny will not drive outside the United States.

Guaranteed Hours While Traveling

• All travel days and all days during the trip fall under guaranteed hours, meaning the nanny
receives her regular daily/weekly hourly and overtime pay structure even if fewer hours are
used.
• If the nanny’s standard weekly schedule includes overtime, the same overtime structure
automatically applies during travel, even if not utilized.

Hourly & Overtime Pay

• All on-duty hours are paid at the nanny’s standard hourly rate.
• Hours worked beyond 40 in a week are paid at 1.5× the hourly rate.
• Daily overtime is not applied; overtime is calculated weekly.
Travel Day Fee
• A $200–$300 travel day fee is applied per travel day, in addition to hourly and overtime pay.
• A travel day includes flights, layovers, long-distance driving, cruise boarding and
de-boarding, port or terminal navigation, luggage/gear handling, boarding transportation, and managing childcare needs and transitions during transit.
• The travel day fee is only applied on days that involve these transit activities.
• The amount is dependent on transit duration, complexity, level of responsibility, and total
travel burden placed on the nanny.

Personal-Use Travel Stipend

• A $75–$150 per-day stipend is provided for personal purchases such as snacks, toiletries,
coffee, and miscellaneous personal needs.
• Amount is dependent on trip duration, destination, and cost of living.
• This stipend ensures the nanny can meet personal needs while away from home without
incurring out-of-pocket expenses during a required work trip.
• The stipend is not for child-related purchases.

Presence Fee (Off-Duty Compensation)

• A $150–$250 presence fee is applied per calendar day to compensate for all off-duty
hours—daytime and overnight—during which the nanny is required to remain at the
destination rather than return home.
• This fee compensates reduced personal freedom, overnight proximity, and availability if
urgently needed.
• The presence fee applies to all off-duty time throughout the entire travel day.

Active Overnight Compensation

• If the nanny is required to wake during the night for childcare duties, a minimum of two paid
hours is applied at the nanny’s hourly rate.
• Additional active time beyond the minimum is paid at the hourly or overtime rate, as
applicable.
• If sleep loss exceeds one hour total, a matching paid recovery period is provided the
following morning.
• Overnight duties disrupt required sleep and directly impact next-day performance. The
recovery period is treated as paid working time under guaranteed hours, as restorative time is
essential for maintaining safe, high-quality childcare.
• The paid recovery period does not count toward the 12-hour cap and does not contribute to
overtime calculations.
• The presence fee still applies.

Daily Paid Rest Break

• One 2-hour paid rest break is required on any day the nanny works a combined total of at
least 8 hours of on-duty and/or on-call time.
• This break is treated as paid time as it occurs within the nanny’s active workday and is
essential for maintaining safe, effective performance during extended travel schedules. The
nanny remains restricted to the destination and must transition immediately back into duty
afterward, making the break part of the compensated travel structure rather than personal
time.
• Off-duty time between split shifts does not replace, reduce, or eliminate the required 2-hour
paid rest break.
• The break does not count toward the 12-hour cap and does not contribute to overtime.
• For consecutive shifts, the break must fall in the middle portion of the shift. For split shifts,
the break may occur before the start of the second shift if the shifts are similar in length; if one
shift is significantly longer, the break must occur during the longer shift.

12-Hour Daily Cap (On-Duty + On-Call)

On Duty:
• Actively responsible for childcare; paid hourly + overtime.

On Call:
• Must be reachable and available; paid at ½ the hourly rate; presence fee still applies.
• On-call time counts toward the 12-hour cap and may push the nanny into overtime
depending on weekly totals.

Off Duty:
• Free personal time; compensated through the presence fee.
• May leave lodging but must remain reachable in case urgently needed.

Definition of a Full Overnight Rest Period
• A full overnight rest period is defined as at least 8 continuous, uninterrupted hours off-duty,
during which the nanny is not on call, is not responsible for childcare monitoring, and is free to
sleep.
• The 12-hour cap is based on the nanny’s sleep cycle and actual rest period—not on the
clock or calendar day.
• This period reflects the nanny’s true overnight recovery window.

What Counts Toward the 12-Hour Cap
• On-duty childcare hours
• On-call hours
• Any middle-of-the-night childcare that occurs before the nanny has received a full overnight
rest period

What Does NOT Count Toward the 12-Hour Cap
• Paid rest breaks
• Paid morning recovery periods
• Presence fee hours
• Jet lag adjustment periods
• Middle-of-the-night childcare that occurs after the nanny has received a full overnight rest
period (this counts toward the next day)

Emergency Extended-Duty Hours 
(Beyond the 12-Hour Daily Cap)

• In rare emergency situations that require the nanny to work beyond the 12-hour daily
maximum of combined on-duty and on-call time, all additional hours are paid at 2× the
nanny’s standard hourly rate, regardless of overtime status.
• This structure ensures fair compensation for extreme circumstances without stacking
multiple pay tiers.
• Examples include medical emergencies, urgent family crises, unavoidable travel delays, or
situations where the nanny must assume additional unexpected responsibility for the child’s
safety.

Paid Rest Day (For Extended Trips)

• For every 5 consecutive travel workdays, the nanny receives one fully paid 24-hour rest day.
• The paid rest day is compensated at the nanny’s standard daily guaranteed hours.
• This rest day is paid as travel schedules are prolonged, high-demand, and physically taxing,
and uninterrupted rest is essential for sustained safe, high-quality childcare throughout
extended assignments.
• Meals remain covered.
• The presence fee and stipend apply.
• The paid rest day does not reduce PTO and does not interrupt guaranteed hours.
• Paid rest day hours do not count toward overtime.

Jet Lag Adjustment Period (International Travel)

• Upon arrival at an international destination, the nanny receives a mandatory 12-hour jet lag
adjustment period before beginning on-duty work.
• This period applies when travel involves a time zone change of 4 hours or more, or when the
itinerary includes a red-eye or overnight flight.
• If the nanny arrives late at night, any overnight sleep obtained may be applied toward the
12-hour adjustment period, with the remaining hours completed the following morning before
on-duty work begins.
• This adjustment period allows the nanny to restore alertness, stabilize her sleep cycle, and
recover from travel fatigue, ensuring safe and effective care.
• Only guaranteed hours that fall within this adjustment window are paid; remaining hours are
unpaid rest time, covered by the presence fee.
• Meals and the travel stipend remain covered as applicable.
• The nanny may rest, sleep, hydrate, and settle into lodging during this period but may not be
assigned childcare, monitoring, or on-call responsibilities.
• If travel delays shorten the available rest time below 12 hours, the adjustment period
continues until the full 12 hours has been reached before on-duty work may begin.
• Jet lag adjustment periods do NOT count toward the 12-hour daily cap and do NOT
contribute to overtime calculations.

Return-Home Recovery Day

• After completing a travel assignment, the nanny receives one paid recovery day on the next
scheduled workday, even if weekends fall between the return date and the next shift.
• Paid at the nanny’s standard daily guaranteed hours.
• This day is intended for rest, unpacking, physical recovery, sleep regulation, and resetting
after multi-day travel demands before transitioning back into standard duties.
• The return-home recovery day does not draw from PTO.
• Paid recovery day hours do not count toward weekly overtime calculations.

Illness or Emergency Return-Home Policy

Work-Related Illness During Travel
• If the nanny becomes sick during travel, it is considered work-related due to high exposure
levels, close proximity to the child, shared environments, disrupted sleep, and the effects of
travel fatigue lowering immunity.
• The family covers the nanny’s return-home arrangements if early return is required.
• Guaranteed hours continue for the remainder of the contracted travel period.
• PTO is not used for work-related illness.
• Guaranteed hours paid during this period are treated as paid non-working time and do not
count toward weekly overtime calculations.

Emergency Early Return Home (Non-Medical)
• If the nanny must return home early due to a true personal emergency, the missed travel
days are treated as work cancellation days because the circumstances are outside the
nanny’s control.
• The family covers all transportation or travel arrangements needed for the nanny to return
home early.
• Guaranteed hours continue for the remainder of the contracted Travel dates.
• Guaranteed hours paid during this time do not count toward weekly overtime calculations.

Medical Coverage Requirements (Domestic Travel)

• Any medically necessary care required during travel—whether illness or injury—is fully
covered by the family, as the nanny is displaced from her home resources while traveling for
work.
• This includes urgent care, walk-in clinics, medically necessary prescriptions, and ER care if
needed, ensuring the nanny does not incur unexpected medical expenses while required to
travel.
• Workers’ compensation coverage is strongly recommended, as it protects both the nanny
and the family in the event of any true work-related injury or illness during travel.

International Medical Coverage Requirements

• A fully comprehensive international travel health insurance policy must be provided for the
nanny for the full duration of the trip.
• Coverage must include:
– Medical treatment
– Hospitalization
– Emergency transportation
– Prescription medication
– Urgent and walk-in care
– Emergency room care
– Medical evacuation and repatriation
• All international medical expenses, treatments, and health-related costs for the nanny during
travel are fully covered by the family; the nanny will not incur any out-of-pocket expenses for
medically necessary care abroad that arises from work duties or the travel environment.

Transportation & Vehicle Requirements

• The nanny will not drive outside the United States, due to major differences in international
road laws, signage, insurance requirements, vehicle specifications, traffic patterns, accident
liability, and increased safety risks in unfamiliar environments.
• The following transportation requirements apply to domestic travel only and only if the nanny
is expected to drive during the trip:
• Rental vehicles must have full liability and full collision insurance coverage.
• Rental vehicles must be safe, appropriately sized, and not oversized or difficult to operate.
• The nanny will not install car seats in rental vehicles; to avoid liability and ensure proper
safety, all car seats must be installed by the family or by a certified car seat technician.
• If the family plans to have the nanny use their family vehicle during travel, all family-vehicle
requirements outlined in the nanny’s standard contract apply during travel as well.

Phone & Communication Requirements During Travel

• The nanny must have reliable phone access at all times during travel to ensure safety,
coordination, and communication regarding the child’s needs.
• The nanny will use her own personal phone during all travel.
• The nanny must be able to communicate freely with her own loved ones during off-duty
hours, including via phone, text, and internet-based communication apps.
• The family must ensure the nanny has consistent and reliable WiFi access in all lodging
accommodations.

International Travel Phone Access

• If international travel is required, the family must provide one of the following to ensure the
nanny’s personal phone works internationally:
– An international phone plan added to the nanny’s existing phone line, fully paid for by the
family for the duration of the trip; or
– A temporary international eSIM or SIM card for the nanny’s personal phone, fully paid for by
the family.
• If the nanny already carries an international plan capable of supporting all travel needs, the
family will reimburse any additional usage fees or travel-related changes incurred during the
trip.

Payment Timing for Travel-Related Compensation

• Guaranteed hourly pay — paid on the nanny’s normal payroll schedule (weekly or
bi-weekly).
• Overtime pay — paid on the nanny’s normal payroll schedule.
• Presence fees — paid after the trip concludes.
• Travel day fees — paid after the trip concludes.
• Personal-use travel stipend — issued in advance, either daily or weekly depending on the agreed-upon terms.

1p09hiz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Procrastinationism/comments/1p09hiz/i_read_40_books_last_year_and_heres_what_i_learned/,I read 40+ books last year and here's what I learned,"this year I set an ambitious goal to read one book per week. I ended up finishing 44 books across fiction, non-fiction, and self-improvement genres.

Here's everything that worked, everything that failed, and the surprising lessons I learned about reading in 2024.

What DIDN'T work:

Speed reading techniques are BS. All those speed reading methods online are mostly garbage. I spent weeks trying different techniques and apps (tried several on both iOS and Android), but faster reading meant worse comprehension. Sometimes slower is actually faster.

Reading only self-improvement books. I burned out hard trying to read only ""productive"" books. By month 6, **I was forcing myself through business and self-improvement titles that felt like homework. Variety is crucial for sustained reading.**

Digital-only reading. I'm a tech person, so I started with just Kindle and reading apps on my phone. While convenient, I found myself getting distracted by notifications and other apps. Physical books kept me focused longer.

What ACTUALLY worked:

The 25% rule. If I wasn't engaged after 25% of any book, I'd quit and move on. This single rule increased my completion rate dramatically. Life's too short for boring books.

Mixed format approach

* Physical books for deep focus sessions
* Audiobooks for commutes and walks
* E-books (iOS Kindle app) for travel
* Summary apps only for books I'd already read to review key points

Genre rotation system. I alternated between fiction, non-fiction, biography, and self-improvement books. This kept reading fresh and prevented burnout from any single category.

Note-taking apps integration. I used Obsidian (available on both Android and iOS) to create connected notes between books. Linking ideas across different books created deeper understanding than reading in isolation.

Morning reading ritual. 30-45 minutes every morning with coffee before checking any apps or social media. This became a sacred time that I protected fiercely.

Podcasts as book replacements. I love podcasts and using them as content was pretty good. I especially liked it when people talked about their experience on how they applied the book.

Podcast supplementation (the right way). Instead of replacing books with podcasts, I found podcasts where authors discussed their books in detail. This reinforced learning without replacing the deep reading experience.

Reading 40+ books taught me that the goal isn't consuming more content it's building a better thinking system. The best self-improvement comes from deeply understanding fewer ideas rather than superficially knowing many. It's better to read 10 good books again and again than to read 100 books without understanding any of its principles.

For anyone starting their reading journey: **Forget the apps promising shortcuts. Get comfortable books in whatever format works for you, quit the boring ones ruthlessly, and focus on understanding over speed.**

I make no apologies for being who i am, the older i get, i seem to care less about what people think or say these days. I'm more comfortable in my skin than ever before and i know what i like and what i dont like. I'm straight up honest and will say what's on my mind but at the same time, im empathic (sometimes it's a curse, and yes it's contradictory) and wear my heart on my sleeve. I'm prone to over thinking and sometimes worry about the little things in life, because the little things are actually really important.

*Lazy mornings, people watching, the warm sun on my skin, fresh coffee, the smell of freshly cut grass, rum (spiced or dark), teasing, exploring castles and forests (not hiking), long drives in the countryside, 90's alternative music, cooking and trying new foods, psychological films, late nights and early lazy mornings, drawing/sketching, dogs.*

**Things i dont like:**  
*One worded responses, going to bed early, cats, twats riding scooters, being out in the cold, crowds of people, being stuck behind slow walking people, cold showers, noisy people in the cinema, dancing.*

So I'm a new stepdad, my long term partner and her son recently moved in with me, and I'm starting to notice something about my new stepson, the kid has absolutely no environmental awareness of his surroundings. When we're out shopping, he'll just be completely distracted and engrossed in his own world, leading him to walk into objects or people, he'll knock glasses and drinks off tables as he walks by because he wasn't paying attention, and is just constantly walking into things, he came home with bruises from school on his face, and I was immediately terrified that he had been bullied, but claims it was because he walked into a lamp post on the way to school that morning, which honestly I can believe having seen how he is. Any advice on how I can help him learn to just look where he's going? I'd have thought going face first into steel post would've been a good incentive to actually look where he's going, but he's clearly not learned since he kicked his mother's coffee mug off the table when getting out of a chair just this morning.",3,1763464849.0,Parenting,5,1.0,False

Last year my bf did a wonderful job, I suppose this made me trust that he cared and I dared to think that this year would be another wonderful year. I still set the bar low, I said just a relaxing day would be nice. That’s such an easy mark to hit I thought. Apparently it was too hard, he didn’t do a single thing, he has promised to take me out to lunch so when lunch came and went I decided to organise it all myself. He barely helped even find a place to go and when he did found the shittiest, cheapest place with terrible reviews. Then he decided to wear the dirty clothes he was wearing the day before. I know it mustn’t be that serious to some, but I set the bar so low, so so low, coffee and a bookstore would have been amazingly perfect. But apparently anything is too difficult. 
I think because I had hope from the year before because of how well he did, I was absolutly crushed and heartbroken. I just could not physically stop the silent tears from falling. I couldn’t make myself stop crying, something in me just broke. For the first time in a long time I had hope that I would feel loved on my birthday and the person who I love most in the world let me down immensely. This got him feeling defensive and he yelled at me yada yada yada.
I should add he did get me cupcakes with a custom picture on them but I had been crying for hours by that point.

1p097pn,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1p097pn/rubber_ducky_youre_the_one/,"Rubber Ducky, You’re the one.","I work on the twelfth floor, in a building that looks like every other glass box in the central city. When you are outside, all you see is your own reflection layered over strangers. When you are inside, all you see are partitions.

My partition is beige. Beige fabric, beige desk, beige drawers with keys no one bothers to use. I have been in this cube for six months now, long enough that the chair has moulded to the shape of my hips, not long enough for anyone on the floor to remember my surname without checking my email signature.

I am an account manager. That sounds more important than it is. Most days I move numbers from one place to another and smooth over the nerves of clients who think the world will end if their campaign does not launch by Friday. My life outside of work is quiet. I have a partner at home who knows me well and likes that I am not the sort of person who goes out drinking after work. At the office, I prefer to keep to myself. Fifty people on this floor, and I could not name more than ten of them without looking at the seating chart.

On the morning the duck appeared, nothing felt unusual. I arrived at eight twenty, same as every day, swiped my card at the gate, nodded at the receptionist whose name I never caught and now cannot ask, walked past the breakout area with its too-bright furniture and the smell of burnt toast. My cube waited where I left it, third row from the window, facing a corridor that leads to the bathrooms and the fire stairs.

I put my bag under the desk and woke the computer. Only when the monitor lit, did I see the yellow shape beneath it.

A rubber duck, the classic kind. Yellow body, orange beak, black dots for eyes. It sat neatly under the rim of the screen, facing me, as if it had always lived there and I had simply been too busy to see it.

For a long moment I did nothing. It is remarkable how a tiny object can pin you like an insect. I did not touch it. I examined the desk, the trash can, the floor. Everything else was as I had left it the previous night. Headphones coiled beside the keyboard. Graph pad, pen, coffee mug ring staining the top of an old media plan. No sign anyone had been through my things.

The duck did not look new. The plastic had a dullness to it, a faint scuff along one side where the colour had paled. 

I have a nephew who is obsessed with things like this. Car rides, bath time, visits to the doctor; he narrates them through the personality of whatever small object he can carry. My sister took him on one of those Disney cruises. She sent photos from the deck, him grinning with a rubber duck in each hand. Apparently people hide them all over the ship for kids to find. Prizes that no one has to earn. Harmless.

Looking at the duck on my desk, I decided that must be what had happened. The story wrote itself. One of the ducks had ended up in my bag. I had dropped it on the floor at some point. A cleaner or a coworker found it under the cube wall and set it in the most obvious place, under my screen, so someone would claim it.

It was a harmless story, and I needed a harmless story.

I picked the duck up. The plastic gave slightly under my fingers. There is a particular weight to objects like that, a hollow lightness that pretends to be solid. I turned it over. No name written on the bottom, no company logo, just a small circle where the moulding seam ended. 

No one commented on it. People passed my cube carrying folders and takeaway coffee. No one leaned in with a joke or an explanation. The duck sat where I had left it, guarding the entrance to my inbox, and by lunchtime I had almost convinced myself it was mine.

A few weeks went by. Deadlines, invoices, client calls. The duck became part of the static scenery, something my eyes slipped over when I stared through the screen too long. My partner teased me about it the one time I mentioned it.

“Office mascot,” she said. “Maybe it’s good luck.”

“Maybe,” I said, even though I do not believe in luck.

Then one Monday, I came in from a miserable commute, peeled my damp jacket off, and found that the duck was no longer alone.

Tucked beside it, nudging its flank, sat a smaller duck. This one was pale pink, the colour of old bubblegum. The beak was painted a softer orange, slightly smudged, as though whoever applied it had breathed too close before it dried. It faced the same direction as the first duck. Their sides touched.

For a moment I thought I was still half asleep. There is a particular quality to unreality on a Monday morning, when the weekend has not finished leaving your system. I blinked once, twice. The pink duck stayed.

The second story that formed was that someone on the floor had seen the yellow one and decided it needed company. Maybe they had found this one on their own desk first and passed it on like office chain mail.

I sat down. My chair creaked in the same tired way it always did, a sound as familiar as my own joints. I studied the two of them. The size difference was just enough to make the pairing feel deliberate. Not two random ducks, but a couple copied from a greeting card. The idea lodged somewhere in my chest that someone, somewhere, thought my duck should have a companion.

You might be thinking that this is where I should have been creeped out. A stranger playing with my desk, decorating my space while I was away. The truth is, my first response was not unease. It was something closer to warmth. I told myself it was harmless, someone being whimsical. I thought, with a kind of embarrassed fondness, that my duck had been given a girlfriend.

If you grew up here, you probably remember the old Englefield ads. Bathroom fixtures and bubbles and those tiny plastic ducks gliding through water that was always just opaque enough that you could not see anyone actually naked. There was a little jingle that went with it, something about rubber duckies making bath time fun. It stuck in your head whether you wanted it or not. Every child I knew at the time had a duck of their own, some direct brand cousin of the ones on television.

That memory came back to me as I looked at the pair under my monitor. The kind of childhood recall that feels less like memory and more like a commercial burned into your brain. I thought of my nephew singing in the bath, lining up his ducks on the edge and insisting they all had names.

Maybe that is why I smiled, just a little, at my desk. I imagine from the outside it looked like nothing at all, one more office worker amused by something on their screen. 

I did not mention the second duck to anyone. There was no one to mention it to, really and I didn’t want my partner to tease me about it. At morning teas, the younger staff gather around the high table near the windows, talking about shows I had not watched and people I did not know. I eat my muesli bar at my desk, the wrapper crinkling softly beneath my fingers, and go about my daily routines.

They had become part of the way I oriented myself to the day. I would arrive, sit, and check that they were where I had left them. It was a pointless ritual, but it made the first few minutes of the morning feel less empty. Two small shapes, bright against the surface of my desk, acknowledging my presence in a way that people did not.

Nothing about it felt frightening yet. That is important to understand. At the beginning, the horror is never in the object. It is in the fact that you talk yourself out of noticing what is strange.

September arrived with a change in the air. I caught what I thought was an ordinary cold. By the second day I could barely stand. Fever, shakes, an ache that burrowed behind my eyes. The kind of illness that confuses time. I spent most of that week drifting in and out of shallow sleep on the couch, sweating through clothes and sheets, grateful that my contract included two weeks of sick leave. The phone stayed off. Work could survive without me for a few days.

When I returned the following Monday, the first thing I noticed was the smell of someone else’s coffee in my bin. A dark ring at the bottom, recent enough that the sourness clung to the air. Someone had used my desk while I was away. It was not unusual; space was scarce on our floor and people borrowed whatever surface they could find.

I sat down and reached for my keyboard. Only then did I realise the ducks were not looking at me.

The yellow one and the pink one had been turned around. 

At first I assumed whoever borrowed the desk had simply found them strange and turned them away. A small gesture of discomfort. I almost laughed at the thought. They were toys, nothing more. But a small pulse of something uneasy went through me, a ripple that I smothered before it could grow.

Looking back now, I understand the truth was different. Someone had been angry.

I picked them up and turned them back, placing them in their usual positions. Yellow to the left, pink angled slightly inward. Restoring the small matching tableau I had become used to. Then I opened my inbox and forced myself to move on.

The following week, a third duck appeared.

This one was tiny, no larger than the tip of my thumb. A bright orange baby duck with a beak that had been painted on in a trembling hand. It sat tucked beside the pink duck. The trio looked like a little family, posed with deliberate care.

I stared at them for a long time. The cuteness of the first duck had been harmless. The addition of the second had been strange but still explained by whimsy. But the third one, this little offspring, felt different. Someone had escalated this. Someone had expectations.

The unease was sharp now. Not fear exactly, but intrusion.

I picked up the smallest duck. The plastic was rougher than the other two, grainy, with tiny ridges where the mould had not been sanded smooth. The paint smudged under my thumb. A little curl of orange flaked away.

I walked down to Jerry’s cubicle. He was one of the only people I spoke to. Younger than me by a decade, bookish, with a stack of sci-fi paperbacks always on the corner of his desk. He was fiddling with a small gear printed from resin.

“Hey,” I said. “Can I show you something?”

He looked up. “Sure.”

I placed the ducks on his desk. He leaned in immediately, adjusting his glasses.

“These are printed,” he said. “Definitely. This layer here is from a cheap printer. See the striations along the side. And the paint is hand applied. Someone used acrylic and didn’t wait for it to dry before adding the detail.” He scraped some from the pink duck with his nail. “Yeah. Handmade.”

My stomach sank.

“Why would someone do this?” I asked.

Jerry shrugged. “Maybe someone is messing with you. Or maybe it’s like a secret-santa-thing. People do weird things in offices. You might have an admirer.”

The idea of having a secret admirer made my skin prickle.

I thanked him, gathered the ducks, and walked back to my cube. They sat in my palm like warm little hearts. Too intimate. Too deliberate.

I dropped all three into my bin. The sound was louder than it should have been, plastic hitting plastic in thud. A small flicker of guilt followed, but I pushed it down. They were toys. Nothing more.

I worked late that night, trying to clear a backlog of emails. By the time I logged off, most of the floor was empty. I packed my bag, took the lift down, and crossed the car park under a sky that looked close enough to touch.

My car sat beneath a sodium lamp. I clicked the key fob. The hazards blinked once.

Then I saw them.

All three ducks sat on the center of my windshield, arranged in a neat line. Yellow, pink, orange. As if they had been waiting. A smear of lipstick had been drawn across the glass, the curve forming a crude heart around them.

The wind brushed against my sleeves, carrying a faint sweetness I could not place. Something familiar and wrong.

The ducks stared at me. Their painted eyes were black dots, fixed with an attention that felt almost human.

Someone had taken them from the bin.

And someone wanted me to see the heart.

I kept my distance from the windshield for several seconds, as if the arrangement might shift if I looked away. The lipstick heart caught the light in a greasy sheen, the smear thick along one side where the pressure had been uneven. I opened the back door of the car, reached for the container of wipes I kept in the side pocket, and tore one free. 

I wiped the glass slowly, pressing hard enough that the smear broke apart into pale streaks. The ducks watched me from where I had placed them on the bonnet, their tiny bodies tipped slightly forward. I cleaned until nothing remained but a faint oily patch. Then I gathered the ducks in one hand and walked to a rubbish bin near the kerb. I dropped them inside without ceremony. The lid fell closed with a soft, final click.

At home I told my partner everything, obviously. She listened while she heated leftovers in the microwave. Steam drifted up from the bowl, obscuring her face for a moment.

“A prank,” she stated. “A weird one, but still a prank. Someone on your floor must have too much time on their hands.”

The explanation was comforting in its ordinariness. I wanted to accept it.

The next morning I went to HR. 

A woman in a navy cardigan took my name and asked me to sit. I told her what had happened, the ducks, the windshield, the lipstick heart. She typed while I spoke, each keystroke a small interruption.

“There are no cameras inside the office area,” she resigned. “Only at the main entrance. The car park cameras have been faulty for months. We are working on that. If someone placed anything on your vehicle, there is no footage.”

I asked whether anyone had been on my floor after hours. She shrugged. “People come and go. Contractors. Late meetings. Hard to tell. We can note this down.”

Her tone made it clear that nothing more would come of it. She folded her hands and gave me a reassuring smile that felt like a dismissal. “If anything else unusual happens, let us know. I am sure this is all harmless.”

By lunch I had convinced myself it was finished. The ducks were gone. The prank had run its course. My desk looked clean, empty, ordinary. Nothing had been moved. My screen lit up with its usual calm blue at the start of the day. No toys. No lipstick hearts. No signs of intrusion.

Two days later my partner called me during a meeting.

Her voice was steady but held something underneath it, something tense. “I got an email at work,” she whispered. “From someone who claims to be in your office.”

My chest tightened. “What did it say?”

“That you have been flirting around. Touching women without asking. Being unprofessional. Strangely, it’s from one of those forwarding accounts you get when you don’t want to give your real email address.” 

Silence opened between us, I knew exactly who I was. I knew what I was capable of and what I was not.

“You know that’s not true,” I said.

“Of course,” she replied, and her certainty was immediate, almost fierce. “You would never do any of that. I told my manager to delete it. It is someone stirring trouble. It has to be.”

Her trust should have soothed me, but something in the back of my mind shifted, a small edge turning.

Someone knew her name. Someone knew where she worked. I had to find out who was doing this.

The email to my partner changed something fundamental in me. A quiet, steady panic began to take shape. I could not shake the feeling that someone on my floor was watching me, studying me, choosing moments to twist.

There were nine women working on my floor. I barely knew any of them. That made it worse. The anonymity created a vacuum my mind began to fill.

I started observing them. Not openly. I watched from my own cube, waiting for any of them to enter the bathrooms. It seemed my only choice, to find something strange in their patterns, to see if they came by my desk thinking I’m not there. Most of them worked on the other side of the floor and constantly walking around would make me seem suspicious. My notes were simple. Just names, or in some cases initials, with times beside them. A pattern refused to form.

The paranoia grew sharper. I ordered a novelty item from an online store, a stapler with a built-in camera meant for streaming pranks. It fed to a simple browser window through the company wifi, saving the footage on my hard drive. I placed it on my desk as if it were an ordinary office tool. The camera captured a wide view to the bathrooms and fire exit. I would catch them in the act, eventually.

Days passed. Nothing changed. Every time I checked the footage, there was never anything unusual. No one standing near my desk. No one reaching over the cube wall. 

By Thursday afternoon, HR sent an email requesting a meeting. My stomach lifted. I assumed they had found something, or that someone had confessed. The subject line simply said “Follow-up.”

The HR office held a different atmosphere this time. My manager sat beside the woman from HR, both of them staring at a single folder in front of them. A company lawyer stood in the corner with his hands clasped. No one smiled.

“Take a seat,” HR said.

I did.

“There have been complaints,” she continued. “Two women on your floor reported that you have been observing them entering and leaving the bathroom at specific times. They stated that you have stared at them in ways that made them uncomfortable.”

She opened the folder. Inside were the pages from my notebook. My handwriting. Names, initials, times, dates. 

“We searched your desk this morning,” she said. “We found these.”

My throat closed.

“We also discovered videos. IT accessed your computer. There is surveillance footage saved locally. You’ve filmed the view beside the women’s bathroom.”

“That is not why it was there,” I said. My voice wavered. “Someone has been tampering with my things. Leaving objects. Watching me. I was trying to protect myself!”

“It doesn’t matter,” the lawyer said. “You violated company policy on workplace surveillance and privacy, not to mention sexual harassment. This is grounds for immediate termination.”

“I was framed!” I yelled. The words sounded hoarse. “There were ducks on my car. Someone drew a heart on the glass. My partner got an email for Christ’s sake!”

HR shook her head. “None of that changes the fact that you kept notes on female staff and installed a camera. We take harassment very seriously.”

They slid a stack of paperwork toward me. Termination forms. A formal notice for security to escort me out. A document explaining that my access card would be deactivated within the hour.

I signed. My hand shook so hard the pen scratched the paper.

When I reached the car, the sky looked blurred, as if seen through water. I collapsed into the driver’s seat and began to cry. Not quiet tears, but a sharp, disorienting grief that left my vision swimming. I called my partner. She answered on the second ring.

“They fired me,” I cried. I kept talking even though my voice barely held shape. I told her about the notes, the camera, the complaints.

“I know you,” she said, but her tone had changed. Cautious. Thin. “But this is a lot. I think I should stay at my mother’s for a bit. Just until everything settles.”

When she came home, she packed quietly. A small overnight bag, the blue one she used on weekends. She avoided looking at the termination papers on the table. 

The door clicked shut behind her. The house felt emptied.

I wish it had ended there. I wish I could say that, truly. I wish I could say she came back a few days later, I found a new job, and everything settled into something ordinary. I wish I could say we laugh about it now. That would be a cleaner story, something with a neat moral edge. You survive something strange, you rebuild, the world rights itself. But that is not the story I am living.

I am sitting here now because our couples therapist suggested I write this down. She wanted a clear version of my side of the events, something I could hand over when the memories become tangled and I start losing track of what happened first. My partner and I have been attending sessions for a couple of months. We still live apart. She says she needs space to breathe. I cannot blame her. My emotional state after the firing was awful. I slept at odd hours. I forgot to eat. 

I still cannot find work. I have applied everywhere. Interviewers want confidence, brightness, energy. I do not have those things. I am living off savings and the numbers shrink each week. I try not to look at them too closely.

The house became something I avoided. Dishes stacked. Laundry sat in piles. I spent entire days in the same clothes. My partner visited once and stood in the doorway like a visitor in a stranger’s home. We talked about a reset. A clean slate. That was before the last thing happened. Before any hope of simple explanations disappeared entirely.

She had been away for a week, staying with her mother, when I found the bouquet.

It was on my doorstep early one morning, the sky still grey with the last of the night. Paper flowers, folded with meticulous care, arranged in a tight cluster. In the center sat a small red rubber duck. This one wore a tiny set of lingerie made from scraps of lace and ribbon, glued unevenly across its plastic body. The sight of it made something twist inside me, not fear but revulsion. A cold, crawling disgust that moved along my skin.

I took the bouquet inside, carried it straight to the fireplace, and set it on the grate. The paper curled as the flames caught, blackening at the edges. The duck melted in stages, its red surface turning soft, then glossy, then collapsing inward.

I started drinking that night. Not much at first, just enough to soften the sharpness of my thoughts. Then more. Days blurred. I wrote a letter and taped it to my own door. I didn’t know who the message was for. I only knew I needed to say something to whatever or whoever had been creeping into my life.

“I do not want you. I will never want you. If I find out who you are I will make your life miserable. I’d rather die than get to know you.”

I really thought then, they’d taken the hint. Nothing happened and I truly felt lighter.

Then came yesterday.

I woke early, a dull ache behind my eyes from too much wine. I stood under the bathroom light and turned the shower on.

When I pulled the curtain back, I saw it sitting in the corner of the tub.

A rubber duck. The size of the original one that appeared on my desk months ago. But this one was pitch black. Not dark yellow, not painted over, but a deep, consuming black that swallowed the light. Its eyes had been painted with white crosses, stark and crooked, the brushstrokes uneven. It faced the wall, its back turned to me.

I didn’t touch it. I couldn’t. My body moved on instinct. I packed a bag. I left the house without looking back. I checked into a small hotel near the motorway and paid for a week in advance. I sit here with the curtains closed and the door secured. Maybe I should call the police. My partner certainly thinks so. 

We had been talking about moving away before this. A fresh start. Somewhere far from the office, far from the city, far from anyone who it might be. Now it feels less like an idea and more like the only option left.

I only know I am tired. Tired in a way that goes past sleep. Tired in a way that makes the thought of leaving everything behind feel like relief.

I really fucking hate rubber ducks. ",2,1763464318.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

1p0969g,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1p0969g/th_rubber_ducky_youre_the_one/,"[TH] Rubber Ducky, You’re the one.","I work on the twelfth floor, in a building that looks like every other glass box in the central city. When you are outside, all you see is your own reflection layered over strangers. When you are inside, all you see are partitions.

My partition is beige. Beige fabric, beige desk, beige drawers with keys no one bothers to use. I have been in this cube for six months now, long enough that the chair has moulded to the shape of my hips, not long enough for anyone on the floor to remember my surname without checking my email signature.

I am an account manager. That sounds more important than it is. Most days I move numbers from one place to another and smooth over the nerves of clients who think the world will end if their campaign does not launch by Friday. My life outside of work is quiet. I have a partner at home who knows me well and likes that I am not the sort of person who goes out drinking after work. At the office, I prefer to keep to myself. Fifty people on this floor, and I could not name more than ten of them without looking at the seating chart.

On the morning the duck appeared, nothing felt unusual. I arrived at eight twenty, same as every day, swiped my card at the gate, nodded at the receptionist whose name I never caught and now cannot ask, walked past the breakout area with its too-bright furniture and the smell of burnt toast. My cube waited where I left it, third row from the window, facing a corridor that leads to the bathrooms and the fire stairs.

I put my bag under the desk and woke the computer. Only when the monitor lit, did I see the yellow shape beneath it.

A rubber duck, the classic kind. Yellow body, orange beak, black dots for eyes. It sat neatly under the rim of the screen, facing me, as if it had always lived there and I had simply been too busy to see it.

For a long moment I did nothing. It is remarkable how a tiny object can pin you like an insect. I did not touch it. I examined the desk, the trash can, the floor. Everything else was as I had left it the previous night. Headphones coiled beside the keyboard. Graph pad, pen, coffee mug ring staining the top of an old media plan. No sign anyone had been through my things.

The duck did not look new. The plastic had a dullness to it, a faint scuff along one side where the colour had paled. 

I have a nephew who is obsessed with things like this. Car rides, bath time, visits to the doctor; he narrates them through the personality of whatever small object he can carry. My sister took him on one of those Disney cruises. She sent photos from the deck, him grinning with a rubber duck in each hand. Apparently people hide them all over the ship for kids to find. Prizes that no one has to earn. Harmless.

Looking at the duck on my desk, I decided that must be what had happened. The story wrote itself. One of the ducks had ended up in my bag. I had dropped it on the floor at some point. A cleaner or a coworker found it under the cube wall and set it in the most obvious place, under my screen, so someone would claim it.

It was a harmless story, and I needed a harmless story.

I picked the duck up. The plastic gave slightly under my fingers. There is a particular weight to objects like that, a hollow lightness that pretends to be solid. I turned it over. No name written on the bottom, no company logo, just a small circle where the moulding seam ended. 

No one commented on it. People passed my cube carrying folders and takeaway coffee. No one leaned in with a joke or an explanation. The duck sat where I had left it, guarding the entrance to my inbox, and by lunchtime I had almost convinced myself it was mine.

A few weeks went by. Deadlines, invoices, client calls. The duck became part of the static scenery, something my eyes slipped over when I stared through the screen too long. My partner teased me about it the one time I mentioned it.

“Office mascot,” she said. “Maybe it’s good luck.”

“Maybe,” I said, even though I do not believe in luck.

Then one Monday, I came in from a miserable commute, peeled my damp jacket off, and found that the duck was no longer alone.

Tucked beside it, nudging its flank, sat a smaller duck. This one was pale pink, the colour of old bubblegum. The beak was painted a softer orange, slightly smudged, as though whoever applied it had breathed too close before it dried. It faced the same direction as the first duck. Their sides touched.

For a moment I thought I was still half asleep. There is a particular quality to unreality on a Monday morning, when the weekend has not finished leaving your system. I blinked once, twice. The pink duck stayed.

The second story that formed was that someone on the floor had seen the yellow one and decided it needed company. Maybe they had found this one on their own desk first and passed it on like office chain mail.

I sat down. My chair creaked in the same tired way it always did, a sound as familiar as my own joints. I studied the two of them. The size difference was just enough to make the pairing feel deliberate. Not two random ducks, but a couple copied from a greeting card. The idea lodged somewhere in my chest that someone, somewhere, thought my duck should have a companion.

You might be thinking that this is where I should have been creeped out. A stranger playing with my desk, decorating my space while I was away. The truth is, my first response was not unease. It was something closer to warmth. I told myself it was harmless, someone being whimsical. I thought, with a kind of embarrassed fondness, that my duck had been given a girlfriend.

If you grew up here, you probably remember the old Englefield ads. Bathroom fixtures and bubbles and those tiny plastic ducks gliding through water that was always just opaque enough that you could not see anyone actually naked. There was a little jingle that went with it, something about rubber duckies making bath time fun. It stuck in your head whether you wanted it or not. Every child I knew at the time had a duck of their own, some direct brand cousin of the ones on television.

That memory came back to me as I looked at the pair under my monitor. The kind of childhood recall that feels less like memory and more like a commercial burned into your brain. I thought of my nephew singing in the bath, lining up his ducks on the edge and insisting they all had names.

Maybe that is why I smiled, just a little, at my desk. I imagine from the outside it looked like nothing at all, one more office worker amused by something on their screen. 

I did not mention the second duck to anyone. There was no one to mention it to, really and I didn’t want my partner to tease me about it. At morning teas, the younger staff gather around the high table near the windows, talking about shows I had not watched and people I did not know. I eat my muesli bar at my desk, the wrapper crinkling softly beneath my fingers, and go about my daily routines.

They had become part of the way I oriented myself to the day. I would arrive, sit, and check that they were where I had left them. It was a pointless ritual, but it made the first few minutes of the morning feel less empty. Two small shapes, bright against the surface of my desk, acknowledging my presence in a way that people did not.

Nothing about it felt frightening yet. That is important to understand. At the beginning, the horror is never in the object. It is in the fact that you talk yourself out of noticing what is strange.

September arrived with a change in the air. I caught what I thought was an ordinary cold. By the second day I could barely stand. Fever, shakes, an ache that burrowed behind my eyes. The kind of illness that confuses time. I spent most of that week drifting in and out of shallow sleep on the couch, sweating through clothes and sheets, grateful that my contract included two weeks of sick leave. The phone stayed off. Work could survive without me for a few days.

When I returned the following Monday, the first thing I noticed was the smell of someone else’s coffee in my bin. A dark ring at the bottom, recent enough that the sourness clung to the air. Someone had used my desk while I was away. It was not unusual; space was scarce on our floor and people borrowed whatever surface they could find.

I sat down and reached for my keyboard. Only then did I realise the ducks were not looking at me.

The yellow one and the pink one had been turned around. 

At first I assumed whoever borrowed the desk had simply found them strange and turned them away. A small gesture of discomfort. I almost laughed at the thought. They were toys, nothing more. But a small pulse of something uneasy went through me, a ripple that I smothered before it could grow.

Looking back now, I understand the truth was different. Someone had been angry.

I picked them up and turned them back, placing them in their usual positions. Yellow to the left, pink angled slightly inward. Restoring the small matching tableau I had become used to. Then I opened my inbox and forced myself to move on.

The following week, a third duck appeared.

This one was tiny, no larger than the tip of my thumb. A bright orange baby duck with a beak that had been painted on in a trembling hand. It sat tucked beside the pink duck. The trio looked like a little family, posed with deliberate care.

I stared at them for a long time. The cuteness of the first duck had been harmless. The addition of the second had been strange but still explained by whimsy. But the third one, this little offspring, felt different. Someone had escalated this. Someone had expectations.

The unease was sharp now. Not fear exactly, but intrusion.

I picked up the smallest duck. The plastic was rougher than the other two, grainy, with tiny ridges where the mould had not been sanded smooth. The paint smudged under my thumb. A little curl of orange flaked away.

I walked down to Jerry’s cubicle. He was one of the only people I spoke to. Younger than me by a decade, bookish, with a stack of sci-fi paperbacks always on the corner of his desk. He was fiddling with a small gear printed from resin.

“Hey,” I said. “Can I show you something?”

He looked up. “Sure.”

I placed the ducks on his desk. He leaned in immediately, adjusting his glasses.

“These are printed,” he said. “Definitely. This layer here is from a cheap printer. See the striations along the side. And the paint is hand applied. Someone used acrylic and didn’t wait for it to dry before adding the detail.” He scraped some from the pink duck with his nail. “Yeah. Handmade.”

My stomach sank.

“Why would someone do this?” I asked.

Jerry shrugged. “Maybe someone is messing with you. Or maybe it’s like a secret-santa-thing. People do weird things in offices. You might have an admirer.”

The idea of having a secret admirer made my skin prickle.

I thanked him, gathered the ducks, and walked back to my cube. They sat in my palm like warm little hearts. Too intimate. Too deliberate.

I dropped all three into my bin. The sound was louder than it should have been, plastic hitting plastic in thud. A small flicker of guilt followed, but I pushed it down. They were toys. Nothing more.

I worked late that night, trying to clear a backlog of emails. By the time I logged off, most of the floor was empty. I packed my bag, took the lift down, and crossed the car park under a sky that looked close enough to touch.

My car sat beneath a sodium lamp. I clicked the key fob. The hazards blinked once.

Then I saw them.

All three ducks sat on the center of my windshield, arranged in a neat line. Yellow, pink, orange. As if they had been waiting. A smear of lipstick had been drawn across the glass, the curve forming a crude heart around them.

The wind brushed against my sleeves, carrying a faint sweetness I could not place. Something familiar and wrong.

The ducks stared at me. Their painted eyes were black dots, fixed with an attention that felt almost human.

Someone had taken them from the bin.

And someone wanted me to see the heart.

I kept my distance from the windshield for several seconds, as if the arrangement might shift if I looked away. The lipstick heart caught the light in a greasy sheen, the smear thick along one side where the pressure had been uneven. I opened the back door of the car, reached for the container of wipes I kept in the side pocket, and tore one free. 

I wiped the glass slowly, pressing hard enough that the smear broke apart into pale streaks. The ducks watched me from where I had placed them on the bonnet, their tiny bodies tipped slightly forward. I cleaned until nothing remained but a faint oily patch. Then I gathered the ducks in one hand and walked to a rubbish bin near the kerb. I dropped them inside without ceremony. The lid fell closed with a soft, final click.

At home I told my partner everything, obviously. She listened while she heated leftovers in the microwave. Steam drifted up from the bowl, obscuring her face for a moment.

“A prank,” she stated. “A weird one, but still a prank. Someone on your floor must have too much time on their hands.”

The explanation was comforting in its ordinariness. I wanted to accept it.

The next morning I went to HR. 

A woman in a navy cardigan took my name and asked me to sit. I told her what had happened, the ducks, the windshield, the lipstick heart. She typed while I spoke, each keystroke a small interruption.

“There are no cameras inside the office area,” she resigned. “Only at the main entrance. The car park cameras have been faulty for months. We are working on that. If someone placed anything on your vehicle, there is no footage.”

I asked whether anyone had been on my floor after hours. She shrugged. “People come and go. Contractors. Late meetings. Hard to tell. We can note this down.”

Her tone made it clear that nothing more would come of it. She folded her hands and gave me a reassuring smile that felt like a dismissal. “If anything else unusual happens, let us know. I am sure this is all harmless.”

By lunch I had convinced myself it was finished. The ducks were gone. The prank had run its course. My desk looked clean, empty, ordinary. Nothing had been moved. My screen lit up with its usual calm blue at the start of the day. No toys. No lipstick hearts. No signs of intrusion.

Two days later my partner called me during a meeting.

Her voice was steady but held something underneath it, something tense. “I got an email at work,” she whispered. “From someone who claims to be in your office.”

My chest tightened. “What did it say?”

“That you have been flirting around. Touching women without asking. Being unprofessional. Strangely, it’s from one of those forwarding accounts you get when you don’t want to give your real email address.” 

Silence opened between us, I knew exactly who I was. I knew what I was capable of and what I was not.

“You know that’s not true,” I said.

“Of course,” she replied, and her certainty was immediate, almost fierce. “You would never do any of that. I told my manager to delete it. It is someone stirring trouble. It has to be.”

Her trust should have soothed me, but something in the back of my mind shifted, a small edge turning.

Someone knew her name. Someone knew where she worked. I had to find out who was doing this.

The email to my partner changed something fundamental in me. A quiet, steady panic began to take shape. I could not shake the feeling that someone on my floor was watching me, studying me, choosing moments to twist.

There were nine women working on my floor. I barely knew any of them. That made it worse. The anonymity created a vacuum my mind began to fill.

I started observing them. Not openly. I watched from my own cube, waiting for any of them to enter the bathrooms. It seemed my only choice, to find something strange in their patterns, to see if they came by my desk thinking I’m not there. Most of them worked on the other side of the floor and constantly walking around would make me seem suspicious. My notes were simple. Just names, or in some cases initials, with times beside them. A pattern refused to form.

The paranoia grew sharper. I ordered a novelty item from an online store, a stapler with a built-in camera meant for streaming pranks. It fed to a simple browser window through the company wifi, saving the footage on my hard drive. I placed it on my desk as if it were an ordinary office tool. The camera captured a wide view to the bathrooms and fire exit. I would catch them in the act, eventually.

Days passed. Nothing changed. Every time I checked the footage, there was never anything unusual. No one standing near my desk. No one reaching over the cube wall. 

By Thursday afternoon, HR sent an email requesting a meeting. My stomach lifted. I assumed they had found something, or that someone had confessed. The subject line simply said “Follow-up.”

The HR office held a different atmosphere this time. My manager sat beside the woman from HR, both of them staring at a single folder in front of them. A company lawyer stood in the corner with his hands clasped. No one smiled.

“Take a seat,” HR said.

I did.

“There have been complaints,” she continued. “Two women on your floor reported that you have been observing them entering and leaving the bathroom at specific times. They stated that you have stared at them in ways that made them uncomfortable.”

She opened the folder. Inside were the pages from my notebook. My handwriting. Names, initials, times, dates. 

“We searched your desk this morning,” she said. “We found these.”

My throat closed.

“We also discovered videos. IT accessed your computer. There is surveillance footage saved locally. You’ve filmed the view beside the women’s bathroom.”

“That is not why it was there,” I said. My voice wavered. “Someone has been tampering with my things. Leaving objects. Watching me. I was trying to protect myself!”

“It doesn’t matter,” the lawyer said. “You violated company policy on workplace surveillance and privacy, not to mention sexual harassment. This is grounds for immediate termination.”

“I was framed!” I yelled. The words sounded hoarse. “There were ducks on my car. Someone drew a heart on the glass. My partner got an email for Christ’s sake!”

HR shook her head. “None of that changes the fact that you kept notes on female staff and installed a camera. We take harassment very seriously.”

They slid a stack of paperwork toward me. Termination forms. A formal notice for security to escort me out. A document explaining that my access card would be deactivated within the hour.

I signed. My hand shook so hard the pen scratched the paper.

When I reached the car, the sky looked blurred, as if seen through water. I collapsed into the driver’s seat and began to cry. Not quiet tears, but a sharp, disorienting grief that left my vision swimming. I called my partner. She answered on the second ring.

“They fired me,” I cried. I kept talking even though my voice barely held shape. I told her about the notes, the camera, the complaints.

“I know you,” she said, but her tone had changed. Cautious. Thin. “But this is a lot. I think I should stay at my mother’s for a bit. Just until everything settles.”

When she came home, she packed quietly. A small overnight bag, the blue one she used on weekends. She avoided looking at the termination papers on the table. 

The door clicked shut behind her. The house felt emptied.

I wish it had ended there. I wish I could say that, truly. I wish I could say she came back a few days later, I found a new job, and everything settled into something ordinary. I wish I could say we laugh about it now. That would be a cleaner story, something with a neat moral edge. You survive something strange, you rebuild, the world rights itself. But that is not the story I am living.

I am sitting here now because our couples therapist suggested I write this down. She wanted a clear version of my side of the events, something I could hand over when the memories become tangled and I start losing track of what happened first. My partner and I have been attending sessions for a couple of months. We still live apart. She says she needs space to breathe. I cannot blame her. My emotional state after the firing was awful. I slept at odd hours. I forgot to eat. 

I still cannot find work. I have applied everywhere. Interviewers want confidence, brightness, energy. I do not have those things. I am living off savings and the numbers shrink each week. I try not to look at them too closely.

The house became something I avoided. Dishes stacked. Laundry sat in piles. I spent entire days in the same clothes. My partner visited once and stood in the doorway like a visitor in a stranger’s home. We talked about a reset. A clean slate. That was before the last thing happened. Before any hope of simple explanations disappeared entirely.

She had been away for a week, staying with her mother, when I found the bouquet.

It was on my doorstep early one morning, the sky still grey with the last of the night. Paper flowers, folded with meticulous care, arranged in a tight cluster. In the center sat a small red rubber duck. This one wore a tiny set of lingerie made from scraps of lace and ribbon, glued unevenly across its plastic body. The sight of it made something twist inside me, not fear but revulsion. A cold, crawling disgust that moved along my skin.

I took the bouquet inside, carried it straight to the fireplace, and set it on the grate. The paper curled as the flames caught, blackening at the edges. The duck melted in stages, its red surface turning soft, then glossy, then collapsing inward.

I started drinking that night. Not much at first, just enough to soften the sharpness of my thoughts. Then more. Days blurred. I wrote a letter and taped it to my own door. I didn’t know who the message was for. I only knew I needed to say something to whatever or whoever had been creeping into my life.

“I do not want you. I will never want you. If I find out who you are I will make your life miserable. I’d rather die than get to know you.”

I really thought then, they’d taken the hint. Nothing happened and I truly felt lighter.

Then came yesterday.

I woke early, a dull ache behind my eyes from too much wine. I stood under the bathroom light and turned the shower on.

When I pulled the curtain back, I saw it sitting in the corner of the tub.

A rubber duck. The size of the original one that appeared on my desk months ago. But this one was pitch black. Not dark yellow, not painted over, but a deep, consuming black that swallowed the light. Its eyes had been painted with white crosses, stark and crooked, the brushstrokes uneven. It faced the wall, its back turned to me.

I didn’t touch it. I couldn’t. My body moved on instinct. I packed a bag. I left the house without looking back. I checked into a small hotel near the motorway and paid for a week in advance. I sit here with the curtains closed and the door secured. Maybe I should call the police. My partner certainly thinks so. 

We had been talking about moving away before this. A fresh start. Somewhere far from the office, far from the city, far from anyone who it might be. Now it feels less like an idea and more like the only option left.

I only know I am tired. Tired in a way that goes past sleep. Tired in a way that makes the thought of leaving everything behind feel like relief.

I really fucking hate rubber ducks. ",2,1763464174.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I recently acquired a Marzocco Linea PB AV 2 Group from 2015 \[Machine\]. The previous owner, a fellow coffee roaster, mentioned that the machine was primarily used for catering and events, and it doesn’t have a **festwasser connection** (fresh water connection). It was modified to operate on 220V instead of the standard power supply.

On pick-up day, he contacted me to say that he had checked the machine before packing it up and noticed that the **pumpe** (pump) was no longer working. When I tested it, I observed that the pump motor runs when I press the ""Extraction"" button, indicating the motor itself is functional. However, the pump isn’t drawing water at startup, which is unusual since it should immediately start pumping water into the boiler when powered on.

He mentioned that some La Marzocco \[Machine\] technicians, friends of his, suggested that dirt or debris in the pump might be the culprit.

I plan on taking the machine with me, but I have some questions:

* Is it safe to open and clean the pump without water in it?
* How should I safely bleed the water out of the pump before opening it?
* When reassembling and turning the machine back on, how can I ensure there’s no air trapped in the pump?
* Could anyone guide me through the proper steps for cleaning and re-arming the pump?

Thanks so much in advance for your time, expertise, and advice!

Over the past few years, I’ve made it a ritual to devote one full month of my “Happiness Project” to gratitude — to re-center, rewire, and reawaken my awareness of blessings, big and small. Every year, without fail, gratitude becomes the shining lens through which I view my life anew. From the comfort of my home, to those who love me, to the small delights (like freshly brewed coffee on a rainy morning), I recommit to noticing what’s already here. This journey explores the inner shifts, daily practices, and mindful perspectives that help cultivate gratitude — and with it, a deeper, more enduring love for life.

But what I’ve learned is that gratitude is not a passive feeling. It’s a practice, a muscle to strengthen. It’s also a living current you can channel into loving your life more fully.

Reflect upon your present blessings, of which every man has plenty; not on your past misfortunes, of which all men have some. \~ Charles Dickens

Why Gratitude Matters

When I first began intentionally practicing gratitude, it felt like a soft, spiritual exercise — lovely but optional. But over time, I realized gratitude is a powerhouse of transformation. It affects your physiology, brain, relationships, and life direction.

The science behind gratitude

●	Neuroscience and psychology show that gratitude practices flood the brain with dopamine and serotonin — the “feel-good” neurotransmitters — helping reduce stress and increase well-being.

●	When we practice gratitude daily, something remarkable happens — not just in our outlook, but within our bodies. Regular expressions of thankfulness calm the amygdala, the part of the brain that processes fear, and lower cortisol, the hormone tied to stress. As gratitude becomes a habit, the body learns to relax; the mind grows quieter, and the heart opens more easily to joy and connection.

●	Gratitude is not just an emotion. It’s action-oriented: by recognizing blessings and responding in kind, gratitude ripples outward.

Because of these effects, gratitude ceases to be fluffy — it becomes foundational. It helps you reset out of negativity, anchors you in what’s working, and opens you to more.

Gratitude is not just an attitude — it is an orientation toward life. \~Terri Kozlowski

The Spirit of Thanksgiving: Gratitude + Reciprocity

One of my favorite discoveries over time has been the Japanese concept of “on” — a deep, spiritual sense of thanksgiving that includes a desire to repay or give back. This is not a compelled obligation, but an inner movement of reciprocity.

The meaning of “on” often includes a sense of gratitude combined with a desire to repay others for what we have been given.

When gratitude becomes two-way — both receiving and giving — it transforms into love in action. People with strong gratitude not only see beauty more often — they express beauty. Even small gestures become sacred: a thank-you note, a back rub, a helping hand.

I’ve often reflected on how gratitude extends beyond the moments that feel easy or joyful. Genuine gratitude is a deeper awareness — one that embraces life’s lessons, even those delivered through pain or challenge. When you can thank life for the wisdom born from your struggles, you move from surviving to serving. Every hardship becomes a seed of compassion, urging you to reach out, uplift, and contribute to the healing of others. Gratitude, then, becomes more than appreciation — it becomes the pathway to purpose.

People with deep gratitude don’t have more — they simply see more and give more. \~Terri Kozlowski

Notice Your Blessings: The Foundation of Gratitude

Gratitude begins not with forcing oneself to feel happy, but with becoming awake to what is already present. It begins with awareness. But how do you wake up to your blessings?

1. Pause and scan. At several points in your day (morning, midday, evening), pause, take a breath, and notice — what’s working? What’s soft, sweet, or beautiful?
2. Sensory noticing. Smell the coffee. Relish the warmth of the sun. Hear the exhale of your child. Taste the salt in your soup. Let the senses anchor you.
3. Gratitude journaling. This is a mainstay in my annual practice. I write 5–10 blessings each day—some big, many small. Over time, your “blessing radar” improves.
4. Gratitude anchor. Choose a sign or ritual — say, every time you open your phone, you pause and think of one thing you’re grateful for.

I like to suggest to clients that they program a nightly reminder on their phone: “List three good things today.” This trains your brain to seek blessings before complaining.

Enough is a feast. \~ Buddhist proverb

Be Grateful for the Little Things -Because They Are Big

Often, you reserve gratitude for the “major wins” — a promotion, a new house, a vacation. But those are rare. The richness is in the mundane: the hug from your child, the call from your sister, a quiet sunset. Over time, these small joys add up.

Tiny daily gratitudes you might overlook

●	The kettle’s whistle - for your favorite cup of tea

●	The way light slants in your window causes a mini rainbow on the floor

●	Or the smell of rain as it cleanses the Earth

●	Warm socks on a cool morning

●	The ease of breathing

●	The chirping of birds as they sing in the morning

●	A text from a friend you haven’t heard from in a while

●	A kind word from a stranger

You can make it playful: pick “five small joys” each morning, name them, and carry them with you. At night, revisit these magical moments. I emphasize this in many coaching sessions: gratitude for the small helps primes you for larger gratitude.

Enjoy the little things, for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things. \~ Robert Brault

Look for Wonder — The Natural Gateway to Awe & Gratitude

If you train your mind, not just your heart, to notice wonder, gratitude becomes less of a chore and more of a natural stance. One month, I challenged myself to look intentionally for wonders in nature — and each day became richer.

The sound of leaves dripping after rain, squirrels darting up trees, a hawk perched on my deck, dew shimmering — these are reminders that life holds unseen magic.

When you pause in nature — or even urban nature (trees, sky, wind) — you align yourself with something vaster. You remember you are not alone; you are part of a symphony. Mindfulness amplifies that connection.

I would maintain that thanks are the highest form of thought, and that gratitude is happiness doubled by wonder. \~ Gilbert K. Chesterton

Express Your Gratitude — The Bridge to Love

Gratitude that stays inside can feel flat or even burdensome. When you express it — in word or deed — it awakens connection and deepens meaning.

Ways of expressing gratitude meaningfully

●	Verbal thanks: Say “thank you” genuinely, with eye contact.

●	Notes or letters: Write to someone who impacted you.

●	Acts of service: Do something for the person without expectation.

●	Public acknowledgment: Praise someone in front of others.

●	Creative expression: Draw, paint, dance your gratitude.

When I run workshops or coaching groups, I always include a gratitude-sharing circle. People often cry, soften, expand, and the energy shifts.

Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present and not giving it.  \~ William Arthur Ward

Reframe Perspective: From Lack to Abundance

One of the strongest levers for cultivating gratitude is perspective-shifting. Your mood, beliefs, and stories color what you see. A shift in the lens changes the story.

Here are the reframing practices you can put into practice for yourself:

●	“What’s working?” Flip from “What’s wrong?”

●	Silver lining inquiry: “What can I learn? What surprise is hidden?”

●	Gratitude in challenge: Find one blessing even in difficulty.

●	Abundance anchor: Remind yourself, “Life is generous; I am receiving.”

●	Gratitude journaling for trials: List what the challenge has taught or brought.

Perspective isn’t denial. It’s discernment. You don’t ignore pain. You widen the lens to see both the storm and the stars.

Some people grumble that roses have thorns; I am grateful that thorns have roses. \~ Alphonse Karr

Gratitude Practice: A 6-Week Journey

To bring all this into your life, here’s a guided 6-week gratitude cultivation path. (Feel free to adapt.)

Week	Focus	Practice Suggestions

Week 1	Awareness & noticing	Once daily, pause and list 3 blessings.

Week 2	Small things & wonder	Notice 5 small joys per day; take a gratitude walk.

Week 3	Journaling depth	Write 10 blessings with a sentence of “why it matters.”

Week 4	Express & share	Write a gratitude note, express thanks to someone.

Week 5	Reframing challenge	In difficulties, list at least 3 hidden blessings.

Week 6	Integration & ritual	Create a nightly gratitude ritual (e.g., gratitude breath).

Bonus: At the end of each week, reflect: How have I changed? What new blessings emerged? Track shifts in mood, perspective, and compassion.

Reflect upon your present blessings … not on your past misfortunes. \~ Charles Dickens

Gratitude & Loving Your Life: The Deep Connection

Why does gratitude help you love your life more deeply? Here are a few connections to consider:

1. It amplifies joy. When we notice the good, joy multiplies.
2. It softens resistance. Gratitude loosens grip on “lack,” allowing flow.
3. It aligns with purpose. When you feel gratitude, you naturally want to give back.
4. It deepens presence. Gratitude roots you in the now, not lost in the past or future.
5. It shifts identity. You move from “I’m not enough” to “I belong, I’m enough.”

Clients say: “When I started writing five blessings every night, I began to feel worthy — and then the people in my life began to treat me that way too.”

Gratitude invites you into a posture of love — love for what is, and love for what wants to emerge.

To live gratefully is to open yourself to possibility, to befriend life’s unfolding. \~Terri Kozlowski

Overcoming Common Obstacles to Gratitude

Gratitude feels simple — but often, resistance arises. Here are common challenges and how to reframe them:

Obstacle	What many say	Reframe / Action

“I don’t feel grateful.”	Emotional numbness or frustration	Start with small, neutral things (breath, light). The feeling follows the focus.

“I’m going through pain / loss.”	“I can’t be grateful now.”	You can be grateful for your capacity to survive, for lessons learned, for the support you have.

“Life is unfair / I have trauma.”	“Others have it worse.”	Gratitude is not comparison. It’s noticing what is for you.

“I’ll feel fake saying thanks.”	“It feels forced.”	Honor the rawness. Speak truth + gratitude: “This hurts … and yet I am grateful for…”

“I forgot to practice.”	“I don’t have time.”	Embed micro-practices (5 seconds) — gratitude anchors (phone, toothbrush, transition moments).

One of my favorite reframes: gratitude is not denying the darkness, but bringing light into the shadow.

Gratitude Beyond Self: Building Community & Ripples

Gratitude is deeply personal — but it is also inherently social. When you express it, you invite connection. When you witness it, you uplift others.

●	Gratitude circles: In groups (church, book clubs, family), invite each person to share one thing they’re grateful for.

●	Public gratitude: On your social media, share a “gratitude snapshot” — a person, moment, or place.

●	Gratitude to strangers: Compliment someone, thank your barista, write a note to a teacher.

●	Service as gratitude: Use your gifts to support, mentor, donate.

When enough people model gratitude, a cultural shift occurs. You become a node of light.

In 2023, the Soul Solutions podcast was honored in the International Positive Change Podcast Awards — winning in the Soul Coaching category. That award itself was a gratitude moment — a blessing, yes — but also a moment to express thanks to listeners, donors, and co-creators.

Gratitude radiates. When one person thanks, many hearts awaken. \~Terri Kozlowski

Sustaining Gratitude: Turning It Into a Habit + Identity

You don’t want gratitude to be a 30-day novelty. You want it to become a stable current in your life. Here are the keys to sustaining it:

1. Ritualize it. Choose consistent practices (morning, night, transitions).
2. Anchor with triggers. Use existing routines (brushing teeth, sitting at the table) as cues.
3. Accountability/community. Partner with a friend or group to share gratitude weekly.
4. Evolve your gratitude. As life changes, your blessings shift. Update your lens.
5. Return when you fall. If you slip, don’t shame yourself — reset gently.

In my life, I have seasons when gratitude flows effortlessly, and seasons when holding gratitude feels like digging. The difference is not in having more, but in recommitting — again and again.

Acknowledging the good that you already have in your life is the foundation for all abundance. \~ Eckhart Tolle

Moving Forward: Gratitude as a Way of Life

As you enter seasons of gathering (holidays, year-end reflection), gratitude becomes even more potent — and necessary.

Here’s how I invite you to move forward:

●	Carry a gratitude lens into every day. Before your eyes even open, name one blessing.

●	Speak gratitude before you act — e.g. “I’m grateful I get to work today” before entering your workspace.

●	Use gratitude to redirect — when complaining arises (“traffic,” “difficult person”), pause and name three things you are grateful for.

●	Share gratitude freely — to family, strangers, community. Let it ripple.

●	Reflect monthly: How has my heart grown? What new blessings have appeared?

I am deeply grateful you’re reading this — and that our paths cross. May you and your loved one's experience a Thanksgiving season (and beyond) richly filled with gratitude, love, and awakened wonder. Let’s co-create more light, more love, more gratitude.

Gratitude is the healthiest of all human emotions. The more you express gratitude for what you have, the more likely you will have even more to express gratitude for. \~ Zig Ziglar",1,1763463768.0,personalgrowthnow,0,1.0,False

So I decided to build my own — fast, ad-free, with a unified UI and a simple goal: make small tools beautiful again.

Built with:

🧱 SvelteKit + Tailwind

☁️ Firebase Hosting + Analytics

⚡ Fully static and no login required

🗳️ Vote for future features


I’d love to hear your feedback before adding more tools:

What kind of tools would you find useful?

Any UX or performance issues you notice?

Would you prefer ads, donations, or subscriptions to keep it running sustainably?

1p08wcy,https://www.reddit.com/r/autismUK/comments/1p08wcy/so_confused_about_my_first_autism_assessment/,So confused about my first autism assessment,"
I feel like my mind is going 100mph right now, I can’t stop overthinking all the questions and what they meant and my responses. This was the first part of the assessment and it was largely activity based and over zoom. I’m wondering if anyone with more knowledge can shed some light on what the purpose of these exercises were? I mostly just left feeling confused and kind of like a failed some kind of test lol 

For the first activity the assessor asked me to find five objects close to me and make up a story with them and I had a complete blank, I put my daughters hairbrush on a coaster and said it could be a boat but other than that I had absolutely no idea what to do with my other items (a fidget spinner, a controller and a plant). I tried so hard to create some kind of narrative but my mind was totally blank. Eventually after me staring blankly at my items, apologising profusely and saying ‘I just can’t think of anything’ fifteen million times, she said don’t worry we can drop this task and move on to a different one. 

For the second one, as I had already mentioned that I like to make my coffee a certain way so I don’t like other people making me one, she said imagine that she came to my house and said she could make me a coffee if I tell her how to, what would that look like. So I just talked her though how I make my coffee, what syrup I use, what spoon I use, that I use an aeropress and how that works, and the order that I do things in. I really am confused about what this one means lol

The third one was a storybook with no words. She started telling the narrative of a boy who had fallen asleep reading a book and asked me to carry on. Again I drew a total blank on this. The book was completely whack and I had no idea what was going on 😂 so I kind of just described what I could see on each page. On one page they were riding pigs so I said ‘the boy is riding a pig instead of a horse’ and she asked me what I thought the phrase ‘when pigs fly’ meant, so I said that pigs don’t usually fly so when something unbelievable happens it’s like a pig flying. I asked a few times if I was doing the book one wrong and she said it didn’t matter, it could be however I interpreted it. I couldn’t think of a narrative because like I said the book was crazy so I just described all the stuff going on. 

The last one was a picture. She asked me what I could see and I said ‘an island’, she said if I’d want to go there and I said no because it’s really busy. Then she asked if I’ve ever been on holiday and I said yes but not really as an adult because I don’t like flying so we just do road trips to caravan parks in the uk. Then she asked if I could go anywhere in the world by any mode of transport where would I go, so I said my choice of transport would be the car and I’d just go to somewhere nice and remote with good views and walks. Then she asked me what I do when I get to a caravan and I said unpack, figure out where stuff is and plan the days. 

Then the last part confused me quite a lot, I feel like it was a test but I have no idea. She said ‘I have some places I’d like to go’ and I waited for her to elaborate but she didn’t, so after an awkward silence I asked her where and she briefly said where, then again she said ‘I have another place I’d like to go’ and again, awkward silence where I thought she’d speak before I asked where. I don’t know what this was, it felt like she was purposefully making things awkward because she was very chatty for the rest of it. Was that a test of some kind?! 

I know I’m overthinking this but I’d love some clarity on what all this actually means and what the purpose of these activities are. If anyone has any information please let me know! Thanks ",2,1763463199.0,autismUK,6,1.0,False

I used it as a mix of city exploring and day trips, splitting my time between wandering the lakefront, visiting museums, and doing quick rides out to nearby towns. It is one of those cities where you can slow down, enjoy the scenery, and not feel rushed at all.

When I first started planning, figuring out where to stay was confusing because Geneva feels like several different mini cities tied together. The lakeside promenade has a calm, elegant energy, while the Old Town feels historic and atmospheric. Meanwhile, staying near Cornavin Station makes day trips super easy.

I stayed at #1 on this list, and it was exactly what I wanted for a four day visit. The rest of the hotels were the options I had bookmarked during my planning, comparing neighborhoods, access to transportation, and overall vibe. Hopefully this helps anyone else trying to figure out where to stay without falling into the same research rabbit hole I did.

# Top 10 Best Hotels in Geneva

# 1. Hotel d’Angleterre (The one I stayed at)

Right on the lake with a front‑row view of the Jet d’Eau. I booked this mainly for the location, but the atmosphere ended up being my favorite part. The rooms feel classic and warm rather than overly fancy. Loved the little touches — slippers already placed by the bed, thoughtful turndown service, and a staff member who remembered my coffee order after day one. It’s a splurge, but waking up to lake views each morning made it feel worth it.

# 2. The Woodward

One of the most luxurious hotels in the city. Suites only, each one uniquely designed with huge windows overlooking the lake. There’s a world‑class spa and a two‑Michelin‑starred restaurant. This was almost my pick, but it felt a bit too formal for this particular trip. Perfect for honeymoons or big celebrations.

# 3. Hotel Bristol Geneve

A solid mid‑ to upper‑range hotel with cozy rooms, friendly staff, and a surprisingly good wellness area. It’s close to the train station and the lake, making it great for short stays. Rooms are comfortable without being overly fancy. Good option if you want comfort and location without paying luxury prices.

# 4. Four Seasons Hotel des Bergues

Arguably the most iconic hotel in Geneva. The interior feels like a palace, and the rooftop spa and pool are unreal. This place is expensive — like, eye‑watering expensive — but the service is flawless. If you want old‑world luxury with lake views, this is a bucket‑list stay.

# 5. Hotel Rotary Geneva - MGallery Collection

A boutique option near the lake and Old Town. Rooms have a vintage, design‑filled aesthetic with lots of character. It’s stylish without trying too hard. I kept this on my list because it offered better value than the big luxury hotels while still feeling special.

# 6. Beau‑Rivage Genève

Family‑owned and full of history. This hotel faces the lake and attracts guests who want a quiet, refined experience. The building is beautiful, with high ceilings and elegant decor. The whole place has a calm, polished energy. Great for travelers who want classic Geneva charm.

# 7. Hotel President Wilson

A modern luxury hotel famous for its spa, outdoor pool, and some of the best lake views in the city. The higher‑floor rooms have incredible panoramas. I considered this one because it’s close to the United Nations, but it’s a bit farther from the Old Town. Ideal if you prefer sleek over historic.

# 8. N’vY Manotel

A fun, artsy hotel that leans more modern and colorful. Rooms are spacious by Geneva standards, and it’s only a short walk to the lake. I looked at this when I wanted something stylish but not overly pricey. Good for younger travelers or anyone who wants a more relaxed vibe.

# 9. Hôtel Longemalle

Located right by the Old Town and a few minutes from the lake. Chic, clean rooms with soft color palettes. It feels boutique and upscale without being over the top. A great base if you want to wander the Old Town every evening.

# 10. Hotel Cornavin

A more affordable, practical option right next to the main train station. Not fancy, but clean, modern, and extremely convenient if you're doing day trips. Perfect for travelers who don’t need luxury and just want a solid, well‑located hotel.

# Where to Stay in Geneva

# By Lake Geneva (Lakeside Promenade)

If this is your first time in the city, staying near the lake gives you the postcard Geneva experience. Peaceful mornings, easy walks, and unbeatable views. Great for couples, slow travelers, and anyone who wants scenery right outside the window.

# Old Town (Vieille Ville)

A historic, charming area filled with cobblestones, quiet squares, and cafés. Hotels here tend to be smaller and boutique‑style. Perfect if you like wandering narrow streets, exploring museums, and ending the day with a glass of wine in a cozy piazza.

# Paquis District

Close to the lake and packed with restaurants, bars, and shops. A bit livelier and more diverse. This area has a mix of mid‑range and budget hotels. Ideal if you want walkability and easy transport connections.

# Near Geneva Cornavin Station

Great for short trips or day‑trip heavy itineraries. The area itself is more functional than charming, but having immediate access to trains and trams is incredibly useful. You’ll get better value here compared to lakeside or Old Town.

# Eaux‑Vives

A trendy, residential neighborhood filled with bakeries, cafés, and small parks. It borders the lake but is less touristy. Perfect for families, digital nomads, or travelers who want more of a local feel without being far from the action.

# Final Thoughts

Geneva might not get as much hype as other Swiss cities, but it’s one of the easiest and most rewarding bases for exploring the region. Whether you want lake views, historic charm, or convenient access to day trips, hopefully this list helps narrow things down so you don’t get stuck comparing 20 tabs like I did!",1,1763462298.0,hotelsreviewed,0,1.0,False

1p08lnp,https://i.redd.it/vc48p02poz1g1.jpeg,"TOP100 Pocket Detective on Duty - Who is selling, Who is holding - lets find out together","Hey all, quick update

You can find the updated spreadsheet [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lqwC0Pc4ORygByWe-G2N9aipWQVYi9FHfavf8J-i5o4/edit?usp=sharing).

Over-all sentiment remains strong, TOP100 didn't have any major changes.

Looking at the data, we can see:

* Top 10 - no changes in their portfolio.
* Top 37 - locked in his gains and sold his entire portfolio ( 6,753,610 Tokens)
* Top 87 - sold 1407735 of his Tokens (that's 61.21% of total portfolio)
* Top 40 - bought the dip and added additional 209k Tokens to his portfolio) - NOTE, he is selling and locking in his gains in a smart way, selling in small chunks to allow people to buy the dip. Locking in that budget Ferrari :D 

Since it's boring update when we see price going down but Top 100 remains strong, I reckon you are more curious to know who is selling. I did more data analysis across all the sells - but don't take my word for it, you can take a look yourselves.

So teach a man how to fish, or give him a fish TypeOf:  
How I check current status manually when ever I am curious:

1. I open [https://jup.ag/tokens/Cz7LGKdZPpAxonXx23ZYPW3RtDQvjcf17ZDCZEzFpump](https://jup.ag/tokens/Cz7LGKdZPpAxonXx23ZYPW3RtDQvjcf17ZDCZEzFpump)
2. Scroll down and you see ""Transactions""
3. From there you can scroll/filter by amounts sold and check who is currently selling, how much they hold etc.

Looking into data from yesterday/Today - conclusion I am making (just my own opinion) - paper hands are trickling down to small dips.

Overall the sentiment remains bullish from what I am seeing, just minor adjustments in price (normal behavior). As we have more listings on different exchanges - seems like we are just getting started.

If there is anything else you'd like me to add to spreadsheet or update some more data points, lmk in comments bellow - I'll implement the changes starting tomorrow

[£300 - £600]

The reason I wanted an upgrade was because I wanted to try flat burrs to see if I would get more clarity and the idea of a zero retention grinder that gives out accurate doses each time sounded great. I also wanted to be able to quickly change grind setting to coarser grinds for cold brew and filter coffee and handle lighter roasts too - DF64V  seemed to fit this option.

Since receiving the grinder all I've had is issues with clogging and every time I have to take it apart to get the clumps out the grind settings aren't the same even if I zero it. So all I'm doing is cleaning clumps and dialling in and never getting a good shot! It's ridiculous. 

So what I'm asking...

Is there a grinder that will give me all of the above without the issue of clumping constantly?

Happy if it even has a hopper too. 

Would be looking for something around the same price range. 

Also DF64coffee customer support is terrible. Poor advice and they keep telling me it's user error even though I've told them exactly what I've been doing since my first email (which matches the advice they gave). They even told me to just put my grind setting up by 20 to stop it clumping. Ridiculous advice - I've already got it set to 30 and its giving me 36g liquid in 15 seconds 🙄.

I live in Ipswich with my partner and our cat. I moved here for her. The girlfriend, I mean, not the cat. Although the cat is a nice bonus. All of my friends I see in person are her friends, who've been really kind in welcoming me into their circle. We go on holiday together and all sorts of good stuff, but sometimes you just need to have friends of your own. This is where you come in, hopefully!

To give you a small overview of what I'm like, I'm more than capable of laughing at myself and I'm into football (I play 5 a side when I'm not injured - which is worryingly often and I'm starting to believe I might be made of Quavers), reading, writing but never finishing anything I start, music (my taste is varied), photography, crime dramas, true crime, and I've recently decided to start collecting Pokemon cards again. Politically, I am left-leaning. That doesn't mean I'm loony left, but I'm also most definitely not a Tory. There's nuance to this stuff!

Anyway, I'd love to find someone who needs a bestie, male or female, to chat to regularly and meet up for coffees/pints every now and then (possibly regularly if we get on well) and do all the usual stuff good friends would do.
