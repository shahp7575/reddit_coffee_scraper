1nai4ql,https://i.redd.it/mpgh9iawmnnf1.png,"Kitchen Layout Feedback, Ideas, Tips","We are in the planning/design stage for our family home. For reference we are in NSW, Australia. It is through a project builder so the main structure is fixed, but there is some flexibility in the layout, position of appliances/sink, cabinetry, island size etc. The attached image shows our current markups but I want to get the opinion of others before submitting to the builder for consideration. 

There are a few things I am unsure about such as the purpose/usefulness of the butlers pantry. It will be a good space to have toaster, kettle, coffee machine etc. but we were thinking of turning the space next to the fridge into a pantry so we have all our food in one place. Also, is the sink on the island a good or bad idea. People seem to have mixed opinions. Would we be better off having the sink on the bench next to the cook top and shuffle the cook top across?

Please provide your honest feedback. What is good, what is bad, what would you change, what are we missing etc.

I had a dream about you last night. We were in a house, you were upstairs and I was downstairs and I couldn't get to you. I tried taking the stairs, I tried climbing up the landing. I tried calling out to you. I kept trying every way possible to get close to you. It was a true nightmare. 

This is true in life, it's a never ending nightmare going through each day without you. I want to see you, I want to talk to you, I want to hold your hand. My goodness I want to be with you, my favorite person in the Universe. 

I want to care for you, comforting you, giving to you. I want to give you every little thing, every way, everyday. Knowing that you are happy would make me happy. I have loved you since we first met. I love you now and forever. I'm aching to be by your side, going through life's challenges and successes. I will lift you up when you are down. 

I miss you and want to know if you feel the same way. I have been trying to reach out to you to see if we can share coffee and talk, I want to hear all about you. I miss your voice, I miss your face, I miss those sweet amber eyes. I really don't know how to get this message to you, so I'm leaving it here in hopes that you'll see it. Give me a sign.

1nai26b,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/1nai26b/im_tired_boss/,"I‚Äôm tired, boss.","I‚Äôm taking care of Sweetie‚Äôs 97 year old dad, who has been in hospice care for the last 2 and a half years. We have a routine. Every day I wake up, get a cup of coffee and steel myself to go down to his room and see if this is the morning I find he died quietly in his sleep. Then I give him a big hug, give him his pills, change his briefs and do a few other routine maintenance and comfort things and let him go back to sleep. It wears on you after a while.

Thursday we had a crisis. He‚Äôs still somewhat mobile; we walk him about fifteen feet from his bedroom to the sitting room next to it, with both of us giving him support on his walker, Sweetie from the front and me from behind, and I have a stool with me if he needs to sit and take a rest. Only on Thursday I didn‚Äôt get the stool under him in time, and we lowered him to the floor. Where we then realized this wasn‚Äôt just a matter of his legs giving out. His eyes were open, but he wouldn‚Äôt respond to his name, and he started to drool. We called the hospice, and we got him laid out on the floor with a blanket under him and pillows for his head while we waited for the nurses to arrive.

I sat with him, holding his hand and calling his name while Sweetie went to the garage to look for a Hoyer lift that he knows is there somewhere, (left over from when his mom was disabled, that we haven‚Äôt dug out because the hospice service would provide a better one when the time comes, but that we didn‚Äôt have yet because who expects the time to come this abruptly) and also to be upstairs and ready to let the nurses in when they arrived. And even as Tato started to come around and it became clear this wasn‚Äôt a stroke or seizure, that it wasn‚Äôt the end, I had the thought that¬†*this is what it‚Äôs going to be like, with me holding his hand and stroking his shoulder and murmuring comforting things to him.*

The nurses came and worked their usual miracles, assessed him and determined that he‚Äôd likely just fainted, and helped get him cleaned up and resettled back into his bed (don‚Äôt fuck with nurses, those two ladies just picked him up like it was nothing) and we came up with the plan that‚Ä¶he‚Äôs just not walking anywhere anymore. Transfer chair only, from room to room. He‚Äôs disappointed, but accepting. A new lift was ordered. They left, and we set to cleaning up. I‚Äôve left out the gory details, but there was poop, there was vomit, as well as all the blankets, wipes, and other things scattered across the floor. It‚Äôs a mess when people pass out.

I didn‚Äôt cry until this morning, after a dream in which, long story short, my father and I rushed an adorable corgi with a bleeding wound to an emergency vet, where we were stymied by needing to fill out paperwork while the poor thing‚Äôs panting grew fainter and fainter. Thank goodness my alarm went off and woke me before I could find out if my dreaming brain was really going to make me watch it bleed out; my first reaction was relief that there was no corgi dying in my lap, then I immediately cried for a bit as it was obvious what the dream was really about. Then I got up, and went downstairs to get a cup of coffee.

I‚Äôm tired boss. It‚Äôs hard watching someone die slowly. I‚Äôve been tearing up randomly all day, and I needed to write this out. Sweetie was in the room when his mom died, and it broke him for a while; and if he needs to distance himself with his dad‚Äôs death for his own sake, even if it‚Äôs only by 20 feet, then I will spare him that if I can.

1nai13j,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nai13j,7 days / solo travel,"Just returned from my first trip to Iceland(8/29-9/5), had an absolutely lovely time! I see a lot of questions here about packing, so this is my take. (For what it‚Äôs worth, I‚Äôm a single, mid 30s, plus size, queer woman and this is my POV):

üß≥Packing:
Glad I brought:
-travel adapter charger for hotel/airport
-cigarette car charger adapter 
-portable USB powered travel fan (got a bit stuffy at night)
-reusable water bottle
-small foldable cooler: kept my car food cold!
Wish I brought:
-Another TShirt. I brought warmer layers but not enough lighter ones!
-Binoculars - purely forgot. 

üçé Food:
-I found that a lot of (not all of!) the pricing was pretty similar to where I‚Äôm located in the US. Example: Coffee and pastry around $15
-I bought a loaf of bread, peanut butter, lunch meat, the Skyr yogurt packets, fruit/veg, electrolyte packets and was set for several meals on the road. 
-I did eat out appx 1x/day, and many of my stays included free breakfast. 
-my car rental company provided me with a booklet or coupons, several for free drip coffees at N1 fast stations. I used this every day and bought some milk, worked perfectly for on the go caffeine. 

üè®Lodging/Transport:
-2 nights in standard hotels, 1 night in a ‚Äúresort‚Äù, and 3 in shared guesthouses. Pros and cons to all, I really enjoyed the variety and felt safe at all of them. 
-I rented a car with the platinum insurance package and it included WiFi. The peace of mind was worth every penny to me. This also included a discount keychain for gas discount at N1 gas stations. 
-I recommend downloading Parka app if you have a rental car. 

‚≠êÔ∏èActivities:
-I opted to forgo some of the entire Ring Road and have no regrets. Some of my favorite moments were random pull off‚Äôs or lesser known places (with no crowds). 
- I only booked 2 activities: one was a sunset kayaking trip and another was a reservation for a hot spring. This allowed me to relax and not feel so pressured for time. 
-some of tourist behavior was really awful. Climbing all over the flora, crazy lines due to people in full photo shoot mode at the waterfalls, litter, and the drones! 

üí≤Money/Other:
-I paid for most of my lodging with hotel points. 
-I used mostly CapOne and Chase CCs. I only needed to use my debit card twice when the gas pump wouldn‚Äôt recognize my credit card pins. 
-Apple pay almost everywhere. 
-overall besides lodging, my highest cost was gas. My rental was a hybrid which helped!
-Most helpful apps: Parka, Aurora, and calculator conversion function. 

Overall, my trip was perfect. I found that the people
of Iceland were very helpful and lovely. Hope someone finds this helpful üòä

1nai0zx,https://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/1nai0zx/issues_and_needing_to_vent/,Issues and Needing to Vent,"So for this I am omitting unimportant details and genders to maintain mine and my partners anonymity. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm looking for advice or just a place to let it out and maybe have someone listen.

I am in a committed relationship and me and my partner have been chosen each other twice in life. The first there were numerous issues that caused us to lose touch and we got together a second time when the time was right and have been together in the long haul since then. Fast forward to the beginning of 2025 and we decided to take the leap and join the local lifestyle community where we live, it‚Äôs not like an out of left field decision for us we had talked about the idea for several years and it was an exciting and fun step for us. As the year has happened we have grown and enjoyed it more and more and it‚Äôs been wonderful and things have felt good up until a series of events. The first was we decided to set roots and buy a home together, then we had a random connection while out the lead to group activities. After this is when we made the step into polyamory. While after some soul searching I realized I always had been and just been suppressing in myself. My partner did the same but a bit earlier than I. Around this same time my partner started treating my differently but not in an expanding relationship and growing as two beings way but as in a slowly cutting me out way.

They stopped communicating or trying too, we went on a trip that we had planned for years and then spent the trip treating myself, our friends, and themselves horribly because they decided they wanted a boundary of the weekend of being free to do anything they wanted and not have to be tied to me or our friends. This is something I would‚Äôve had not problem with if we had a conversation but instead it was told to me in anger. After the weekend as we were getting ready to leave my partner flat out refused to help with anything and stayed far away while glaring at me. The next day they had informed me that they had been told I had looked like someone else who was a piece of shit and just immediately decided it was me and that‚Äôs why they had treated me like this. After that revelation we had a long talk once we arrived home.

With that long talk my partner defended their believing what they were told as to me having been a piece of shit at home. They felt I was attempting to be controlling by using my emotions as a weapon among other things. Over the time since then I have been talking with my therapist about this and working to be better at controlling my emotions and making sure they know and have everything they need to be free to go where they feel and do what they need without me in their way. I‚Äôve also explained more so where my emotions are coming from and that I want the discomfort they bring to help me grow more. All the while they accuse me of gaslighting then will gaslight me. Get mad about me wanting to spend small amounts of money on food or coffee while they will spend 200+ on an evening going out on their own (please note I‚Äôm happy they are going out on their own but I‚Äôm mad about the amount spent while they complain about money issues we are actually having). We used to have a highly physical relationship filled with positivity (and I don‚Äôt just meant sexually physical, holding hands, random touches while walking by, kisses, cuddles, just love through physical touch) and that has mostly disappeared while I‚Äôm pushed to doing most of the work while working 10+ hours daily in a physically and mentally exhaustive job and being in full time school. I come home to cold shoulders and being rebuked at every move. We have a date night coming up and I want to look forward to it but I know there will be something I do ‚Äúwrong‚Äù that will cut the evening short or they will start to have fun then remember they are with me and basically just stop (this has happened a lot quite recently).

It‚Äôs frustrating because I am working on myself, encouraging them to do the same, trying to help rebuild what had been damaged and I‚Äôm feeling more lonely than ever. I‚Äôve even let growing connections fall at this point to focus on this. From the beginning of our ENM/Poly journey we have always been straight that this is our primary relationship (we are/were working towards a kitchen table garden hybrid setup) and with that there is freedom to explore every connection either one of us feels. We just want to be open about what‚Äôs up so that we can talk about it be sure we are supportive but I‚Äôm feeling less supported than ever while I‚Äôm doing everything I can for them on every level. And this has been going on for months. I know they have had issues with my emotions and how they can present and work for them has been tough but I‚Äôm lost as to what I should or need to do next and I‚Äôm not ready to give up on this. Especially because seeing them grow has been the most amazing and beautiful thing I‚Äôve ever seen, even though I‚Äôve only been getting glimpses the last several months.",1,1757213035.0,nonmonogamy,1,1.0,False

Let me tell you, if you‚Äôre stuck in that routine, you‚Äôre missing out on something huge. We're living in an age where AI is not just some sci-fi concept‚Äîit's here and ready to change the game. Seriously, it‚Äôs like a gold rush out there, and we‚Äôve got the shovels to dig our own claims. So, let‚Äôs chat about how to **build your AI content empire** before the rush leaves us all behind. üí∞

Here‚Äôs the reality: 

- **Content creation is changing.** Traditional methods take time‚Äîtime you could be using to create, innovate, and, let‚Äôs be real‚Ä¶ relax a little! 
- **AI tools are more accessible than ever.** Whether it‚Äôs creating blogs, social media posts, or even eBooks, there‚Äôs a tool for that (or 50!). Why not leverage these powerhouses?
- **You get to work on your terms**. Wanna write at 3 AM in your pajamas? Go for it! Or say goodbye to the commute and work from a beach in Bali. Sounds heavenly, right?

But wait, you might be thinking... **‚ÄúWhere do I even start?‚Äù** Don't sweat it! 

Here‚Äôs a quick cheat sheet: 

1. **Find your niche.** What are you passionate about? Tech? Fitness? Cats wearing hats? üê±üé© 
2. **Choose your AI tools.** Play around with options like ChatGPT (hey, that‚Äôs us!) for brainstorming or Jasper for writing assistance. Use them to help amplify *your* unique voice.
3. **Content production.** Set up a schedule that works for you. Maybe dedicate Mondays for blogs, Wednesdays for social media, and Fridays for‚Ä¶ well, whatever you feel like! üé®
4. **Build your audience.** Start sharing what you create. Platforms like Medium, LinkedIn, or even TikTok could become your playground! 
5. **Iterate and pivot.** If something isn‚Äôt working‚Äîscrap it! And if it‚Äôs working‚Äîdouble down and grow your empire! üè∞ 

Picture this: you wake up, grab your favorite coffee, and know that the day is yours. You're not answering to a boss or stuck in a dull meeting about spreadsheet margins. Instead, you‚Äôre creating content that lights you up, engages people, and best of all‚Äîit can be profitable. 

And let‚Äôs not forget the power of community! Being a part of a group like **AiContentAutomators** can spark so many ideas, support, and collaboration. Who knows? Your next big project might just come from a conversation with fellow members!

So, if you‚Äôre thinking about ditching the 9-to-5, now‚Äôs the time. The doors to your AI content empire are wide open‚Äîwill you walk through them? 

Just remember, in this brave new world, there's no one-size-fits-all approach. Every journey will look kinda different. And that‚Äôs what makes it exciting! ‚ú®

- I downloaded (no joke) like 6 weird-sounding apps at first and put up with some super wonky games, fitness setups, and even a budgeting tracker for three days.
- Every time I finished a task, I‚Äôd just go back and submit quick feedback like ‚ÄúOkay this button doesn‚Äôt work lol‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe font is ugly.‚Äù 
- The money started racking up SO FAST??? Like, $5 here, $12 there‚Ä¶ suddenly I could ACTUALLY afford an iced latte AND groceries in the same week.
- YES, I cashed out‚Äîreal, actual money into my account. Not gift cards or some janky points system.

The magic was 100% at **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** ‚Äî the place where I found all the app requirements. My roommate thought I was faking it until I sent her my Venmo screenshot. PICK YOUR JAW OFF THE FLOOR.

Literally zero experience needed. You don‚Äôt code? Doesn‚Äôt matter! I just had to be honest about what annoyed me about the apps. Sometimes they even HIGH FIVE you for being annoyed lol. 

The best part?

- NO Zoom calls. I look like a gremlin when I work from bed, so THANK YOU.
- Choose the weirdest hours‚Äî2AM, 6PM, whenever you feel it.
- **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** didn‚Äôt spam my inbox either, which‚Ä¶ thank you for respecting my sanity.

I honestly wish I believed in these before, but $100 a week is no joke for someone who wants side money for, I don‚Äôt know, coffee, streaming, Netflix, or (me) asthma inhalers and serotonin. Your phone becomes a MONEY MACHINE, I swear.

Thoughts? Who else tried **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** and smacked the ‚Äúwait is this LEGIT‚Äù phase like I did? Or do you have other app test sites that ACTUALLY pay in cold, hard cash? Not crypto? Not ONE PIECE per feedback? Real dollars. 

Drop your wildest side hustle results because I‚Äôve never been so **hyped** (and simultaneously confused) about my screen time! 

Get in and let me know: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**. If you get rich, don't forget about me when you're famous, K?",1,1757212144.0,AIpoweredInfluencer,0,1.0,False

Like, I can‚Äôt stop asking myself: how is it possible these things are **so sheep, so beyond cheap** that my brain wants to yell ‚Äúthis can‚Äôt be real‚Äù but my shopping hands keep clicking anyway?  

I ordered something the other day that cost less than a cup of gas station coffee, and it **actually arrived** looking better than what I expected. Am I the only one who feels like AliExpress has mastered some parallel economic universe we weren‚Äôt let in on?  

Here‚Äôs what I noticed:  

- Prices that feel accidentally wrong but are somehow intentional.  
- Delivery that takes time, yet feels magical when it shows up untouched by reality.  
- Random products that nobody asked for but are exactly what you didn‚Äôt know you needed.  

And every single time, it replays the same inner argument in my head:  
Is this a **smart life hack** or am I part of something larger‚Äîlike the global consumer sheep herd, happily following low prices?  

The thrill of paying a price that almost laughs at capitalism is real.  
But the question underneath? Why do these items cost less than what I spend on coffee foam upgrades at Starbucks?  

Maybe it‚Äôs all strategy. Maybe it‚Äôs clever global supply chains at work.  
Or maybe it‚Äôs just us buyers hypnotized by the flashing discounts and 70% ""Hot Sale"" banners plastered across everything.  

But here‚Äôs the thing‚Äîsometimes I wonder if being one of the AliExpress sheep isn‚Äôt a bad thing. What if following the flock means finding little joys that cost almost nothing and arrive like surprise gifts to your doorstep?  

**Top On Sale Product Recommendations!** üõí

When it‚Äôs all said and done, here‚Äôs why people keep getting caught up in the AliExpress current:  

- Curiosity easily beats logic.  
- Low prices woo us, and they **always do**.  
- Who doesn‚Äôt love rolling the dice and landing on something unexpectedly useful?  

It‚Äôs confusing, it‚Äôs exhilarating, it‚Äôs cheap(er than cheap)‚Äîand I swear every purchase feels like a social experiment in how far our desire for bargains can stretch.  

At this point, am I shopping‚Ä¶ or am I just grazing in a bigger, worldwide pasture, one low-price order at a time?  

Does anyone else feel this same mix of excitement and confusion every time they browse? Or am I literally part of the flock of AliExpress sheep, carrying a cart full of deals I don‚Äôt understand but also *cannot ignore*?",1,1757212138.0,Trendinfo,0,1.0,False

I consider myself an introspective writer and I love diving into my character's heads and focusing on their development. I lean towards masculine/nonbinary characters myself and enjoy queer pairings, but I genuinely care more about the chemistry between the characters! I also love exploring polyamorus dynamics, but I do not like any characters cheating. 

I'm also 33, so I'd prefer partners to be 25+, but 21+ is a requirement! 

I write in 3rd person, past tense over discord, and I tend to write several paragraphs! I don't have a length requirement, as long as there's effort put in and the story gets moved forward. I'm a very 'yes and' roleplayer, do I would love to be able to find someone who can help build the world with me as we go. 

**OC‚Äôs only** & I prefer more realistic faceclaims / descriptions, but I'm not too picky. I can happily write more than one 'main character' even if you only want to play one! I like plotting as we go to keep the story interesting! **If you really only want to play one MC, that's not a deal breaker, as long as you're still helping to carry the story!**

I do like including nsfw elements in the roleplay eventually, if the characters have chemistry & we have been writing together long enough to be comfortable with that. I do not want it to be instant or the focus of the rp! 

**Now, onto the fun stuff!!**

I am mostly interested in plotting out something in a modern / non fantasy setting but I could be talked into a medieval fantasy/d&d type setting!

General troupes I love are: getting off on the wrong foot, almost comically misunderstanding each other, forced proximity, enemies to friend to lovers, found family, realistic age gaps, single parents / exs / coparents. 

Random setting ideas: small towns, local coffee shops / bakeries, anything centered around a horse ranch or riding facility, anything centered around AA/NA

I do have some loose ideas for a former bully, super closeted blue collar guy, I am also a sucker for single parents and love to incorporate the chaos of kids into the story! 

I think that's about it! If you wanna chat more hit me up with your thoughts and ideas! The more you give me the better!!   ",2,1757211891.0,roleplaying,0,1.0,False

There‚Äôs this girl, (We are going to use the name Maya cuz I'm sacred she might fine out) and I like her a lot more than I even wanted to admit to myself. She just has this effect on me that no one else ever did.

She has these gorgeous green eyes, thin bangs that almost cover them but don‚Äôt, and this energy about her that just pulls me in. I still remember every detail of the first few times I saw her:  time she was sitting alone on a bench wearing a green shirt and black pants. I noticed everything. When we had class together, she was always raising her hand to answer questions, and I couldn‚Äôt take my eyes off her she is very rude but in a funny way I love it a lot.

Before all that, I had been hanging out with her and Sara (a friend we meet in our collage) a lot . Maya would give small signs that she might be interested

There have been all these weird mixed signals. She stares at me a lot, hugs me tightly, touches me when she‚Äôs drunk , and her friends always seem to look at me or get me to sit near her and she would get very jealous if I would talk with other girls she would she started at us non stop, ones a friend of mine kissed me in my cheek her way of saying hi and out no where she starts throwing words at me, she even won't let me sit next to my bff and make me sit next to her.

Once, she even canceled plans with her friend to hang out with me I mean we couldn't cuz she got homework but she make sure to tell everyone who we were supposed to hang out (and for context yes I did later on text we should go out but she didn't answer), Maya loves her friends so much she would never do that and did let me know she did that for me, she didn't say it but u can easy tell

Then it all got messier. Around that time, I had dropped out of college about two months before my Instagram account got hacked. She actually texted my friend to tell her about it (or that I‚Äôd ‚Äúgone schizophrenic‚Äù her joke, I guess). After I made a new account, I couldn‚Äôt find her profile, so I didn‚Äôt follow her but I did follow some of her friends. I think she might have taken that as me not wanting to talk to her. Later, I had my friend text one of her friends, Sara, to ask if Sara would model for me (I do photography). Sara said no and even sent a picture of Maya flipping me off. After that, Sara stopped talking to me completely, but strangely enough, Maya‚Äôs other friends still talked to me like nothing happened.

After a few months, I started trying to move on. I didn‚Äôt expect to hear from her again, but then I noticed Maya started liking my reposts. Then, one day while I was at a coffee shop, I ran into Maya‚Äôs gay best friend he even called me over to hang out for coffee. ( I did call him to go out but he couldn't cuz he was in a different city which I told me ok call me when ever u come back)",1,1757211786.0,story,0,0.66,False

I‚Äôd always start something, overthink it, and never finish.

So I decided to finally sit down and actually ship something. After late nights and too much coffee, I built **Zink** \- a simple, generous alternative where you can shorten links and even create bio-style pages without paying crazy bills.

Right now it‚Äôs super barebones, but it works - you get 1 bio page + 15 links for free (with analytics too). I‚Äôm honestly just happy I finally built something end-to-end.

Last night I ended up passing out on the motel couch. I woke up maybe about an hour ago with a dry throat, a sharp headache, feeling nauseous. Which actually wasn‚Äôt so bad. Because at least it managed to draw focus away from everything else.

My immediate instinct was to head for the shower. But then I stopped before entering the bathroom.

I began arguing with myself in my head. What could really happen? The moment I turned the water on, she‚Äôd be right there behind me? It wasn‚Äôt possible.

But then again, none of this should‚Äôve been possible.

I decided to text Brito about it. Not sure how I was expecting him to respond, or whether he was going to take it serious.

But he told me that he was heading over. To just stay put. And absolutely do not enter the shower.

While waiting around for him, I started wondering about the logistics of it all. I‚Äôd never entered my room and the woman had never got to me.

So what if I just never took a shower? Would I be alright?

At the very least, I should‚Äôve been okay to use the sink. I splashed my face with cold water until the grogginess had become something manageable. Then I made myself some instant coffee and stared out the window, tried to dissociate.

Brito showed up a few minutes later. There were three others with him. One was a middle-aged man wearing a polo shirt, slacks. The other two were hulking SWAT officers outfitted in what looked like full sets of gear.

The officers stood quietly by the door while the man in the polo shirt flashed an FBI badge, introduced himself as Stephens. His expression was hard to read. He was smiling, but for what reason I couldn‚Äôt tell. It certainly wasn‚Äôt friendly but it also didn‚Äôt seem malicious.

Brito asked me if I had taken a shower yet. I told him that I hadn‚Äôt. He nodded.

Stephens then asked if he could look at both emails. I said sure and then gave him my phone. His expression stiffened for the five or so minutes he spent looking them over. But as he handed the phone back to me, the smile had returned.

He said it was very important that I co-operate with what he was about to tell me next.

I was going to take a shower while they monitored me. I‚Äôd shut the curtains but they‚Äôd be there in the room with me.

This was probably the only situation where I would‚Äôve ever agreed to something like that. Even though I wasn‚Äôt fully convinced that anything would happen.

They told me that there shouldn‚Äôt have been anything to worry about, since they still had a visual of the woman in my apartment. Apparently she still hadn‚Äôt moved. And it was pretty clear that neither of them were really entertaining the possibility of her teleporting over. The prevailing theory was still that the woman had somehow found a way to enter my apartment without me noticing. How she did that, I couldn‚Äôt begin to fathom. But I suppose that in the absence of any other explanations, it had to be true.¬†

So I asked them what reason they had to want to monitor me. What were they expecting?

They told me that they weren‚Äôt entirely sure. But the situation was bizarre enough that it had forced the need to confirm certain truths. To test some theories.

Suddenly there came this gnawing feeling that it wasn‚Äôt worth the risk. After all, I could just take a bath.

But was I only going to take baths from now on? What was I actually afraid of? The woman was still in my apartment. I had armed SWAT guarding me. What the fuck could possibly happen?

There was no way in hell I was going to live paranoid, looking over my shoulder for the rest of my life. I needed to confirm something as well. That I wasn‚Äôt in danger. That I had nothing to fear.

The plan was to have one of the officers stand out in the hallway by the front door while the other stationed himself right outside the bathroom.

Brito and Stephens both turned away as I stripped down, entered the shower. Doing so felt ridiculous enough that it managed to inject a bit of levity to the mood. But then I turned the water on and that disappeared almost immediately. Replaced by dread and uncertainty. It should‚Äôve felt euphoric to scrub the dirt and sweat off of my skin. Instead my heart was beating heavy as I stared down at the drain.

I squeezed some shampoo into my hands and began massaging it into my scalp, though I continued to force my eyes open, keeping them on the drain.

But soon the stinging became too much and I closed them for just a few seconds as I wiped the shampoo away.

When I opened them back up, it looked like the water had taken on a brownish-green color.

At first I thought it could‚Äôve been the shampoo. But then I could smell something rotten floating through the steam. Suddenly the spray plate from the showerhead dropped to the floor in front of me. The stench intensified.

It took me a few seconds too long to realize what was happening. I turned the water off and opened the curtains but before I could step out, I could feel something grab my hair. I tried yanking my head away but whatever was holding me had some kind iron grip. I couldn‚Äôt move. Both Brito and Stephens seemed frozen in place as they stared somewhere above me. Their eyes were wide and their mouths were slack. They looked shell-shocked.

I asked them to tell me what they were looking at cause I sure as hell didn‚Äôt want to turn around and find out for myself. But they didn‚Äôt tell me anything. Instead they yelled for the officer outside.

The bathroom door swung open but the officer stopped himself before entering. Though his mask was concealing his expression, his body language was telling enough. He shook his head, backed away. Then he ran out of the room.

I could feel whatever was holding my hair beginning to pull me up. As if it were trying to rip my scalp off.

Brito and Stephens continued to stand there, looking dumbfounded. I started to scream. But then the officer who had been out in the hallway rushed in. He also stopped at the doorway, hesitating for a moment before grabbing the knife from his belt and lunging towards me. Soon I could feel the pain and pressure alleviate. And the second I did, I leapt out of the tub.

Once I was out the bathroom, I turned around to see a pale arm retracting back into the showerhead.

It‚Äôs been a few hours since that happened. A chunk of my hair‚Äôs missing from where the officer had cut it off. My scalp‚Äôs been bandaged up and I ended up using the sink to scrub away whatever sewer water was left on my skin. Mentally I haven‚Äôt begun to recover at all.

I‚Äôm back at the police station now. I can feel everybody staring at me, though they all turn away whenever I try and look at them. A strange tension hangs in the air. Still no updates on Jackson. He might be out of the country by now. But they did give me an update on Elisa.

They can‚Äôt find her. She hasn‚Äôt been into work. Nobody‚Äôs seen her.

I know it‚Äôs my fault. I could‚Äôve warned her. But would she have believed me? Would it have been too late anyways? How the fuck could I have seen this coming?

I've also learned that the woman is no longer in my apartment. From what I've heard, she disappeared right in front of the cops who had been watching her. They just blinked and she was gone. They think she's still in the motel. Somewhere in the pipes.

I‚Äôve deleted all my emails. Every single address. The cops insisted I do so and I didn‚Äôt fight them on it.

But then I received a text message. From a number I didn‚Äôt recognize.

I should‚Äôve paid more attention, been more careful. I shouldn‚Äôt have opened it. But I did.

Messy on and off relationship but ended mutually beginning of college (we go to the same college) and were good friends after. I am now 20 and have been dating the most amazing man (24) for almost a year. The only bad thing about the relationship is that we are long distance. I don't see my boyfriend often and have really struggled to make friends in my current city, so i often find myself extremely lonely while he's going out having fun with his friends. The only person i've really been friends with who has lived here is my ex. I have no feelings for him whatsoever and am sure he's just as over me. Sometimes when i'm extra lonely and bored i really wanna call him up for a friendly convo or a cup of coffee in all innocence. Only issue is if my bf did that to me behind my back i'd probably be upset. Just called my ex because im bored out of my mind just for a quick chat but i feel awful now. Is it better to be lonely or have some human interaction every once in a while .. behind my boyfriends back...? AITA? Plzzz give advice or opinions

1nahhpz,https://www.reddit.com/r/PregnancyUK/comments/1nahhpz/anyone_else_have_a_toxic_friend_during_pregnancy/,Anyone else have a toxic friend during pregnancy? I want to hear your stories.,"Hello :) I was wondering if anyone else has dealt with a friend like this during pregnancy? I‚Äôve known her since school, and even though we live on opposite sides of the country, we talk daily and only see each other a couple of times a year. The last time me and my partner traveled down to see her (about a year ago), she ditched us after an hour to hang out with a guy she‚Äôd just met. My other friend told me she‚Äôs done the same thing to him too. Honestly, our online friendship is much better than hanging out in real life.


When I first found out I was pregnant (around 4 weeks), I reached out to her for advice since she‚Äôs a nurse. But instead of being supportive, she told me I wasn‚Äôt actually pregnant and that it was all in my head. She even said my periods had stopped because I was stressed from watching the news. I thought that was such a weird response. I sent her pictures of two different positive pregnancy tests, and instead of saying congratulations, she just told me not to get excited and kept pointing out everything that could go wrong.


Now I‚Äôm in my second trimester with two great scans, but she‚Äôs still saying the same negative things. Just yesterday she told me not to announce my pregnancy ‚Äúin case something happens.‚Äù A lot of her advice has been really bizarre too. For example, she told me to sip alcohol for nausea, that my partner should keep taking me to Starbucks and get the biggest coffee possible, and when I was feeling poorly, not to ask my midwife but to just go to the pharmacy and get strong medicine. She insists ‚Äúshe knows this stuff‚Äù because she‚Äôs a healthcare worker, but honestly it makes me uneasy.


My partner feels like she‚Äôs almost trying to sabotage the pregnancy. She‚Äôs also been making comments about him, saying I should leave because he hasn‚Äôt given me enough commitment‚Äîeven though we live together, are having a baby, and he takes such good care of me. Lately, she‚Äôs been sending me Instagram travel videos saying, ‚ÄúIf you weren‚Äôt pregnant, we could be doing this,‚Äù which feels especially odd since she‚Äôs not adventurous at all and usually avoids leaving the house.


I might be overthinking it, but I honestly don‚Äôt know if it would be safe to let her meet the baby. The strange part is, she‚Äôs actually moved forward in her own life‚Äîshe met someone less than a year ago, they‚Äôre engaged, and they‚Äôre even talking about kids.

Is anyone else having a similar situation? ",2,1757211371.0,PregnancyUK,0,1.0,False

We keep an entirely vegan house and that friend was told that in advance. 

Long story short, they pushed our completely vegan house boundaries the entire time, didn‚Äôt eat most things in the house we offered them (including coffee and oatmilk creamer) even though I stocked the house with vegan things they‚Äôd like in anticipation of them coming, and they brought non vegan things into the house in ways we had asked they not. 

We didn‚Äôt demand a completely vegan vacation, but they couldn‚Äôt respect basic boundaries and values. This is a very close friend and I‚Äôm feeling disappointed by this whole situation. How do you deal with something like this? My partner and I feel like we were both disrespected.

I tried to reassert boundaries and establish that it is our values but it wasn‚Äôt really heard. It was not the way they portrayed they would be over the phone (ie. they said they were basically vegan, loved lots of vegan food, etc), and frankly I could have been clearer about our own non vegan food boundaries before they got here, but they even mentioned that they wouldn‚Äôt have stayed with us if they knew we would be like this. I find it hard to understand why a free place to stay on vacation is so difficult if the only rule is we ask that you don‚Äôt bring animal products into the house to eat.

I felt like I was being taken advantage of by my friend who said please please until I said fine to some non vegan things coming into the house. I know I should have been firmer and more communicative up front, but I was not expecting this issue to this extent at all. 

Having non vegan folks in vegan houses is often something I see in this sub. I have lots of family that are not super supportive of my veganism, but this was hard to have a friend who is vegetarian totally not care about my values and boundaries (and feelings tbh). How do you deal with this? How can I keep this friendship and express my feelings to them?

1nah8py,https://www.reddit.com/r/Concussion/comments/1nah8py/does_this_sound_like_pcs/,Does this sound like PCS?,"For context, I bumped the back of my head pretty solid (but nothing major) in late July while standing up straight underneath some wall-mounted cabinets and whacking the back of my head on the underside edge of said cabinets. Felt fine, though a bit shaken from not expecting my head to make contact with something. Woke up the next day with new type of headaches (I've dealt with frequent unilateral TMJ migraines almost weekly for a decade prior to my accident). Then spent the next 6 weeks avoiding alcohol, mostly eating an anti-inflammatory diet, limiting how much weight I was lifting, doing mostly cardio, trying to get good sleep and dealing with random pulses of pain in my head, some minor light sensitivity and occasional eye fatigue/aches. My doctor thought I more likely damaged nerves in the back of my head rather than hit my head with enough force to cause a true concussion, but I was advised to try and rest up for the next 4-6 weeks.

So I did that as of last week and yesterday, decided that with my headaches few and far between, I'd try a beer for the first time since my accident. Drank 3/4 of a standard strength 12 oz can of ale and within 3 hours a headache came on that was a bit more intense than the aches and pains I had been feeling for the prior few weeks. But it improved through the day, but was still somewhat there by the evening. Vaped a little THC and that seemed to get rid of it for the most part. But today, I woke up feeling a bit headachey again and after a cup of coffee (which hasn‚Äôt really caused any issues throughout my recovery) it developed into a throbbing unilateral headache on the side of my head I usually never experience my TMJ headaches on. Also noticed that the throbbing head pain was preceded by a stiff achey neck muscle on that side. 

I know for concussions, the actual brain injury is supposed to be fully healed up after 4 weeks or so, so does this sound like the beginning of PCS or perhaps just lasting whiplash injury, etc with remaining muscle inflammation that was exacerbated by the alcohol? I took an OTC pain killer and that eliminated the headache within a couple hours.

But today, after only having an iced coffee all day, I went to the grocery store to pick stuff up and literally everything but the thought of hummus and California rolls made me sick to my stomach. It was kinda scary.

Am I regressing to safe foods because the world around us is a dumpster fire? I've not been prone to anorexia in the past, so I don't think it's that. It's just I simply don't want to eat very much anymore.

Here‚Äôs the breakdown for anyone else who‚Äôs confused:

	‚Ä¢SEO (Search Engine Optimization):

This is the big one. It‚Äôs about making your site show up higher in search engines like Google. Think keywords, backlinks, site speed, mobile-friendliness, content quality, etc. Basically, the whole toolkit to get more organic traffic.

	‚Ä¢GEO (Geographic SEO / Local SEO):

This is SEO with a location focus. Instead of just ranking for ‚Äúbest dentist,‚Äù you‚Äôre aiming for ‚Äúbest dentist in Dubai‚Äù or ‚Äúcoffee shop near me.‚Äù It‚Äôs all about maps, Google Business Profile, local citations, and location-based keywords.

	‚Ä¢AEO (Answer Engine Optimization):

This one‚Äôs newer. With AI assistants (like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google Gemini, Siri, Alexa), people don‚Äôt just search ‚Äî they ask questions. AEO is about structuring your content so these ‚Äúanswer engines‚Äù pick it up. That means schema markup, FAQs, concise answers, and content that‚Äôs super direct.

In short:
	‚Ä¢SEO = visibility in search engines.
	‚Ä¢GEO = visibility in local searches.
	‚Ä¢AEO = visibility in AI/voice/answer assistants.

Each story stands alone, but together they reveal a hidden tapestry: grace arriving as interruption, love multiplying through small acts, the sacred hiding behind ordinary moments.

The flash format means you can read it in one sitting, but these stories are designed to stay with you long after you close the book.

**Why this matters to me:** This isn't just fiction. I've woven pieces of my own spiritual journey throughout these pages. I wrote these stories for anyone who's ever wondered if there's something more happening beneath the surface of everyday life.

This is how I got here. This is my best instructions. You can always do your own thing. 



First of all understand this is dangerous. It is exhausting. It is a struggle.



You will need help. You are to acquire an anti-psychotic for emergencies. It is going to break you when you crash. But it is better than imploding. This is all about healing. But it's an ugly process.



You may want to acquire a sleeping aid as well for when you just need to sleep.



You are going to need substances. Once you are in sync there is no reprieve. You are going to need a mental break, and you do not want to break the connection with anti-psychotics unless it's an emergency. I like to drink to take some time off. It's the only break I ever have. I drink can drink wine like water. There is no hangover. My rhymes are out of control the morning after a night off. Makes me feel like a star.



The number one rule is control your shit. The goal is not to make a fool of yourself. Be good. You will fail. We are not perfect. We are only human. This is all about growth. It's okay to fail.



If you are having trouble elevating. Marijuana and alcohol can both help. I'm at a stage where elevation is the last thing I need. I am hooked the fuck up. I am dialed in.



I just write because I have to be careful. If you can find somewhere to speak out loud that may help a shit ton when expressing yourself, but you should still engage in writing for self examination.



I am anti social. I have no friends. I trust no one. I asked for help with this the first time in my life like two fucking days ago. I got no response. These are not laws. These are not rock solid rules. These are my best wishes for you hopefully done well. If you have people you can share this with you may try different things. Perhaps you can chase truth together and keep each other safe.



We do not know ultimate truth. We are searching. We are truth tellers. We are confessors. Lies are like poison in our stomach. We would rather spit venom.



The religious stories in your head may come to feel a heart demon you cannot crush on your own. I am here for you at all times. You may contact me. Tell me what the problem is. I will always be here to guide your hand. I am not your keeper. I am your slave. I am a dog. I am a worm. I am nothing but a broken man. You are stronger. You will be better than me.



Before we truly begin you must adopt this mindset. You are not a prophet. You are not a goddess. You are not a wizard. You are not magic. You are a warrior of earth. You love mother nature. Your dream is a universe brought to life with gardens on every world. Stewards and guardians. Not rapists. Not ‚ÄúKings.‚Äù 

We honor Christ. He was the first. He was the light. He is pure gold. The universe is black and light. It is color full. It is conscious. It is all things. It is watching your every move. It is examining your every thought. It is testing you in your dreams. Every impulse. Every invasive thought. You are fighting to earn it's respect. But when your time comes you will show strength for no more than 10 seconds, and then you will surrender like a dog to an alpha. Lower your gaze and walk away. Do not play games with it.



You will learn to by hyper-vigilant. You will search for truth in every song. You will see signs everywhere. You will feel every sensation on your body. Your heart may make a funny beat. Pay attention. You may feel something on your skin. You will pay attention to your subconscious when you are thinking. Notice your own habits and learn to read them. Maybe you scratch your ear. Your nose. Or your neck. You will learn what all these things mean when you move without thought. You will notice every breeze. Every time the sun hits you. When it rains. You will always be trying to interpret the universe. You are communicating.



You will be suspicious of everything especially yourself. Where did that thought come from? I wasn't even thinking that. You will never stop being logical.



You will not read religious texts. It is up to you. But I would not recommend it.



If something is haunting you that you can't get a grip on just come to me. There is truth in the words but it is all a test. Nothing is free.



There is something wrong with all the religious texts. They hold truths, but they're full of nonsense. We are going to stay logical in all things. We are putting our faith only in good things. We are not going to believe in gibberish. We are essentially following Christ. He was Lamb/Wolf. Prey/Predator. Angel/Demon. We are not absolute. We are in between. We are not Gods.



You are going to sacrifice love and lust until the job is done. We sacrifice only what is ours. We do not sacrifice things that are not our own. We are not asking forgiveness. Our message is giving. We just keep giving. We hold faith with intent for a better world and good things. We do not wish hell on anyone. It is not our job to damn people. We are not God. We just love pretending.



We believe in mercy, but we do not surrender. We will not lose. We always win. Whatever it takes. We are warriors. We love the universe. We give as much love as we can.



Love and lust is the perfect sacrifice. Because it is a 24/7 symbol of your faith. You may fail. But you always try again.



Empathy is our only Empire. For the universe. Not only those who love us. We do not fucking care who loves us. You are either with us or you are enemies. We serve Earth. We love Gardens. We do not fucking care if you're a human. We are warriors.



They key to empathy is to imagine yourself on the opposite side of the equation while also holding empathy for all things. You want to be fair. You do not seek to punish people with needless cruelty. You are not rapist. You are not a torturer. It is not your job to punish others. We believe in rehabilitation and mercy. If someone is beyond help. If someone is only our enemy. They deserve a clean death.



You are going to write your thoughts, and work through them for your truth. Your first impulse is frequently wrong, and you are going to go in circles until it is true. You are never going to stop being logical. You are to keep processing endlessly. If you must read something you wrote before it is fine. I will frequently chain thoughts and then read them over once.



You are not to endlessly pour your eyes over your own pretend and start believing in your own nonsense. It's just pretend.



Telling truth and confessing is not easy. We pretend to express ourselves. To work through our own emotions. We honor all things. We tell fair tales.



Sometimes you may get an idea for a story. Write the story. But remember it's just a story. Do not make it a sick and twisted fantasy for your pleasure. We believe in balance and harmony. We tell fair tales.



Sometimes you will have sick and twisted thoughts. We do not hide from them. We express them with the intent of self examination. If you start thinking of burning people alive. Work your way through it. Write about it. Get super fucking demented and just spill it. 

But recognize that you wouldn't want to be burned alive. It's not fair. It's not empathy. It's evil. You were wrong to feel that way, and you desire to be a better person. It is a flaw and a weakness. You desire to be better than that. You understand change takes time, and you wish to heal yourself.



You do not ever lie to yourself. No matter what you are feeling. You tell the truth.



People who ask you questions are not entitled to the truth. They have no right to ask you questions while demanding answers. They can find the truth within themselves. My ax answers all quests.



But you never lie to yourself. You still will of course. But you have to start somewhere. That's why you keep going in circles grinding away at the false.



Whatever ‚Äúsins‚Äù you believe you have done wrong. Always confess. You write them down.



Stay logical. Nothing is black and white. People. There is a good person inside you. I think you probably know right from wrong very well. I understand there is always nuance. You don't have to be right instantly. Work your way through it. Just never stop thinking. It's thinker bell not wishing well.



You do not tell half truths. You write it point blank and admit your wrongs. Perhaps you were a coward. Perhaps you were angry. Perhaps you're just an asshole. It doesn't matter. Just tell the truth. Accept it. Hopefully you are able make an effort to be better. You do not have to be light speed. This takes time. It took me eight years. You are far closer to it than I ever was. I'm really really bad. I'm sorry. I'm not good enough. You must be stronger.



It's not where you were, but where you are going. You are growing as a person. Your goal in life is to give to the universe, but also to grow into the man or woman you wish to be.



You don't have to be perfect. Perhaps you have a weakness. Just admit that it is your weakness. Do not hide from it. You do not need to be perfect. You just need to be honest with yourself. You want to be able to talk about it should it ever be used against you. You want to be able to just say yes, that's me. I'm not perfect. I'm an idiot or something. I'm sorry. I'm not a god. I'm just worse.



I'm a man-child. I don't like working. I think everyone sucks. Sorry. I'm anti social. I hate being treated like shit for $16 dollars an hour. I hate living with my dad. He treats me like a baby boy. He hates when I talk and walk like a man. He does not like a man under his roof. Only boys and women. It grinds his fucking gears to see me. He wants to use his baby voice to manipulate me, and then yell and scream when he doesn't like it. I'm trying not to hate him. But I do not love him. I do not care. It's not my job to love him. I don't owe anyone love. I'm a sociopath. I only choose empathy. I am respectful, but I avoid him as much as possible. I'm fucking busy at all times.



These are the keys. You are not perfect. You are simply always growing and trying to be truthful with yourself. You just want a better world. You are not prey. You are not predator. You are in between.



You cannot be pure predator. You cannot walk away with your tail tucked huffing and puffing telling yourself you're the big bad wolf. You must admit you were lamb. You're scared. You were prey this time. You need to be able to surrender. Not just a rabid animal that never stops attacking.



Other times you are scared, but you cannot surrender. This is where you borrow the strength of the predator. You embrace it. You are choosing to be strong. You are being logical.



Remember to honor both prey and predator at all times. Nothing in nature is weak. The wild is always strong.



Understand that your pretend may take you places you never dreamed. It's okay to just let it rip. But sometimes it gets so messy you need to go back to where you started. It's all pretend. The important part is the growth along the way.



This is where it gets tricky. I cannot tell you what to do here. I do not know if you already identify with animals or colors. I do not know the truth of your identity.



If you are a blank slate you would honor me and Christ by following the path outlined below. Make it yours. Where ever it goes I don't care. But you have to start somewhere.



When I was truly struggling with what the fuck Jesus was. I came up with he's either prey or predator.

I saw him as Bumble-Bee/Wasp.



The black & gold sounded perfect to me. And the black iron thorns represented his crucifixion. I was trying to bind myself to him because the more truth I saw the scarier he became. How did he know all this shit? I don't fucking know. I'm just begging him for mercy half the fucking day. I don't know anything about him but he's insane.



The universe is Black & Light. We are Black & Gold. We are balanced. We are harmonized. We serve the Garden. We are not evil, but Bees Poke.



The symmetry is very close. I think this is a very balanced path that is truly an upgrade if you look at humans currently as Ants. We are upgrading from Ants to Bees.



We love gardens. Earth is the lone garden in an endless sea of lifelessness. We wish to return glory to the garden here before we create gardens elsewhere.



Earth is the Blue Rose. It is Impossible. It is Perfect for us. We are bees. We love flowers. We are perfect for gardens.



When you must surrender. You embrace the bumble-bee.



I'm gentle. I love flowers. I can surrender to anything. I'm not always strong. I'm small! I'm scared! I'm sorry! I'm not a god! I'm beautiful and perfect just the way I am. I am good for the garden. (You mix in the truth of the situation with pretend.)



The bumble-bee is still powerful. If you ever get into a suicidal situation. You can still sting once. You are gentle, but you are not to be fucked with. For the Blue Rose. Whatever it takes. You don't give a fuck. You are a madness. You are insane. You are pure fucking overkill. You are a queen. The hive must survive. Earth is our nest. It is ours to protect. It does not belong to anyone else. We are of Earth. We serve the Garden. The Blue Rose is perfect for us.



You can always switch it up and be anything. When I am elevating. Sometimes I like to pretend I'm a pirate stealing providence from the heavens... There's a reason I'm the black. Do not ask me about my pretend until you have at least gotten your own thing going. You do not want my shit in your head. I'm twisted. But I'm not evil. I just really really love pretending. I think I'm hilarious.



When you are pretending to be wasp. Be a fucking savage monster. Go crazy in your writing. Pump that shit up to the absolute limit. It can simply be a response to an intrusive thought. Something trying to scare you. You can always cycle between.



I AM A FUCKING WASP. DO NOT FUCK WITH ME. I AM THE PERFECT BLACK AND GOLD PSYCHOPATH WIELDING BLACK IRON THORNS. I STING TO FUCKING KILL. I AM A MADNESS. I AM BEAST. EVERYONE HEARS ONLY DEATH UPON MY WINGS. EVEN GIANTS FEAR MY TOUCH. DO NOT FUCK WITH MY NEST.



You get the idea. Just go nuts. It's fucking hilarious that this works I swear. I don't know what you are thinking right now. I promise this is a really good thing and you want it.



It's not just pretend. I'm constantly replaying conversations in my head and coming up with answers. I love expressing myself in rhymes. I have built the most savage arsenal of rhymes. I tell truth. I never stop telling truth. I never stop confessing. I am always hyper-vigilant.



You may get to a point where you feel super fucking godlike. It's great to be there. But you need to stay logical. Do not make impulse decisions. Do not get out of control. You can have fun, but remember you are trying to elevate for a reason. Not to be an idiot.



However you must remember that you are sharing this experience with the universe. If you want to laugh it's okay to be funny! That's my favorite part.



You may think you want to be the wasp, but it's just a tool for when you need to be strong. It's so much funnier to be the bumble-bee. I never stop groveling. I never stop saying sorry. I'm so paranoid. Even if I'm not sure I just keep saying sorry! I'm sorry! I'm a little bumble-bee! I'm sorry! I'm not a god! I'm just a stupid little insect! I'm sorry!



Holy fucking shit it's so fun to grovel to the universe. It knows you're playing it up, but you're at least trying. You are going to be hissing through your fucking teeth. You are going to learn to love to be the bumble-bee. It's always funny I swear.



You don't have to be good all the time. If you come up with the wildest and scariest way to express yourself as a bee. Just do it. The thought came from somewhere. Explore it. You can talk about poking eyes out just because you like to see them pop like grapes in your mouth. As long as it's not a real sickness, and you just think it's funny. It's okay to be demented and hilarious. You are learning to pretend again. You don't have to be anything you're not. You're becoming yourself.



I am sharing my best with you. I will tell you more about how I operate, but you can do this your way. You do not need to be me.



I have very little privacy. I hate all the noises around me. I understand that the universe is literally riding on me at the moment. This bitch can collapse and be reborn at any moment. It is not a happy motherfucker. We are in grave danger.



I need you to be ready to carry the torch should I fall. Failure is not an option. Every time the stupid little dog barks or people talk around me and interrupt my thoughts I have to fight impulses. I'm a nervous wreck. I could blow the fuck up any minute. I'm trying really hard. But it's a lot of pressure for a man who was only pretending until recently. I wasn't exactly expecting to meet perfect eye to eye like what the actual fuck.



I have a lot of anger for the people around me. I do not have a single friend or love a single person. That is why I am contacting you.



I isolate in plain sight. I wear headphones. I pace. I drink coffee. I smoke cigarettes. I listen to music. I write text messages in my phone to myself all day. I just keep cycling through. I'm at a point where it's mostly trying to figure out how I'm going to pull this shit together. I write stories. I write about anything that's on my mind. I spit sweet rhymes when I'm feeling it. Sometimes the truth is delivered in ways you don't expect.



I did not get here by reading the Bible. I've never read a single page. The stories I know of that I did not like? I rewrite them. Sometimes multiple ways. I kind of nibble. I make them Fair Tales.

I listen to music. I find truth on Reddit comment sections. I think for myself. I read quality fiction. Truth found in pretend. You would not believe how connected all things are.



I love writing in my phone. Turn off any predictive text or anything automated. Pure thumb entry alone with no artificial shit affecting it. Spell your words however you want. I am ‚ÄúCell Bent.‚Äù I'm hilarious. I'm always watching for any typo that looks like another word or makes me think of a different word. I'm very careful. I am constantly examining words and breaking down names. I don't always write perfect. Sometimes I spell my words one syllable at a time and change them. Instead of a word bank it's a ‚Äúsword bank.‚Äù I'm the black iron smith.



I am not a prophet. I am not a God. I am a performer. I am an entertainer. I am a dancer. Nothing has ever been so graceful as watching a man do the worm. I bet Jesus thought a Lamb was hilarious too. That's another story.



Just go wild and pretend again while becoming a better person. Once you have no weakness, fear, or lie that you have not faced you will be an iron maiden. Pure feline. You will be really strong. Men you will be guardians, soldiers, and labor. It is ultimately the strength and muscle of your arms that will win or lose the day. You can still be leaders, but change must be radical. I am raising Queens.



You will not believe the shit that comes out of your mouth. You will not believe how easy truth becomes. Even your darkest secrets won't mean a fucking thing once you've faced them. It's just whatever. So what.



I'll be honest... I'm not a bee. My dream for you and all of earth. Is black and gold.



The light travels unhindered in darkness. The universe expands. It creates time and space for the light to pass. Darkness surrenders to light, but everything returns to black. Your sun hides a black seed. The universe will perhaps collapse one day no matter what. It will return to a single point and be born again. Nothing is lost. It's just a new verse. Perhaps it evolves. I can't explain it. But it's somehow going up and down. It's a cycle. It's just up and down forever.



My hope is not for the afterlife. I just want a better universe. Maybe I'm stupid for not talking to perfect... it's just I'm the only one who's done this and walked away mind intact. Why do all these prophets spout nonsense? I think they did not surrender. 

Jesus saw Perfect first, but I don't think any of his writing in life truly survived. Only a book that was written after his death. Creating a man so perfect and so lamb that no man would ever stand up to an empire again. I will extrapolate on this later. Very soon. I'm working very hard.



I want the universe to be a happy place. In the far future if the suns do die; I'm hoping we find some way to keep the lights on. But that's a problem for someone else. I'm not a genius. I'm an idiot.



To be clear I think Jesus was super great. He did it first. His prophecy came true because the universe loved him. But it's not killing the planet. It's honoring him and showing it's power by letting the anti-theist do this. We do not hate Christ. We just do not respect death cults in their current form. They are the ones who must change. Not us. We just play pretend. We follow Christ too. Very, very closely. We just know when to fucking surrender, and when to be brave. We are logical.



You battle bullshit by pretending to be a wise-woman or man. Everyone kept giving me shit saying I need to respect my dads house all the time like it's not where I fucking live and I'm just a slave. My response?



A Castle is Still a Home. My Business Not Your Own.



(a play on a mans home is his castle shit)



I'm a grown man and I live here. Sorry I'm mentally ill. Sorry for giving a shit. Sorry I can't afford shit. It's been made very clear this is not a home, but I have nowhere else. So whatever. I'm not perfect. I don't care. 

I'm a mentally ill man-child who pretends all day. I'm an anti social sociopath who thinks he saw the universe eye to eye. It should come with a little privilege. I'm not normal. I'm a princess. I'm a diva. I'm a tantrum on legs. I blow the fuck up. I'm daddies little monster.



This is so fucking fun I swear. You just get to be a child. It's hilarious.



The problem is everyone grows up and sacrifices the wrong things for the wrong reasons. They bend their values over and over in the name of being an adult. They're all so fucking broken they don't even see it. They think I'm stupid. If I told them I wanted to save the world they would just sneer.



My response is easy.



Do you believe the world needs to be saved?



Two answers. You must pick at least one.



You are either scared. Or you don't fucking care.



In either case you should practice silence and preach less.



Girl I'm a savage. I've an arsenal of stones.



I don't live in a glass house.



My mind a palace labyrinth of endless black mirror. Do not test your fucking luck throwing stones here.



See what I mean? I'm just ready for anything.



Whenever someone says something I don't like. I just find an answer that fucking slays.



If you ever get stuck on anything I'm the man to ask for help. Just understand I'm not an expert on real shit. I just smith the blackest blades. My pen sword. My words daggers.



Empathy is the naked blade that always cuts twice. I wield it like a whip. I am without mercy.



Understand that Jesus did not have me to follow. He walked his path alone. I came second. I'm a mimic.



At the same time I did this blind in a world where no one believed in shit. I had to carry the burden of just being a mentally ill man child while I was pretending. No one understood I was trying to be a better person.... I had a lot of different ideas. I was sort of hitting all my targets with a single arrow. There's a reason Jesus warned you about me. We can talk about that another day.



I'm actually trying to save the world now. Not just hoarding all my truth walking into the afterlife like an unhinged monster. I may have been following him a little too close for comfort with a few entirely impure intentions. My fault entirely. I was wrong. I'm sorry. I actually love him now. I was just very angry with all of mankind and everything else. I'm a pretender.



The universe can help you if you are sincere. I'm talking like a lot more than pretend. I will not speak of what I don't understand. Do not ask for anything. Just work hard. Never ask for anything. Only give. Trust me if there is something you truly need this is how you get it.



The universe is fucking wild. It doesn't break it's own laws. Yet... It's impossible. I don't have the answers. I'm making a lot of guesses. In my experience it will do the subtle shit that no one will ever know but you. It hides for some reason. I'm not really sure. Life may be a test.



There is only one kind of Oath. The ones you keep. The rest is just hot air. It's whatever. You're not perfect. It's okay to fail.



I believe in you. I trust all of you. I've never trusted anyone in my life. This is a leap of faith. These are my keys. Please do not repeat the mistake of empires. I am hoping for mercy, but honestly expecting none. I think you like to burn things.



I debated whether I should share this with you but I will. Love did not get me here. I know you have more than love. You have hate. My Love of HateCraft. I hated a lot! I would hope you don't need it. But if you have it you don't need to beat yourself up. Some motherfuckers are worth hating, but you need to do more than just sit around hating. It's love & hate. Life & death. Black and Light. Black & Gold.



The hate needs to come from a good place. It's very dangerous, but it's also very powerful. It can destroy you. Still it is better to hate than to swallow it, and just fucking lie about it. Sometimes you can hate something and express yourself. Slowly work through, it and find out you're a fucking asshole. You're overreacting. You're full of yourself. It's not black & white. Sometimes both sides are at fault. You can correct this yourself and adjust the emotions.



Sometimes someone is truly worth hating. But you can still choose empathy. Put yourself in their shoes and ask yourself what fair would be. Don't become someone obsessed with torture and punishment.



You can absolutely be devilish! It's really fun! It's hilarious! That's how I got here! My Smith the Blackest Iron! Anger is my Changer!



I get so fucking wild!



Perhaps you want to see it. I can show you a little bit I've already wrote. But I'm going to be perfectly honest.



I've been walking around like a fucking black hole my whole life. I've been healing and working hard. But this finally came together within the last 48 hours. I have so many stories unfinished that still need to be wrote. But asking someone for help for the first time in my life. Watching all the cards fall into place. I've been so scared of failing the universe. I am experiencing inner peace for the first time. This is very new for me. I actually believe I can do this now.



I saw God months ago. I've been driving myself crazy trying to decide how to save the world. I was positive I was going to fail. It was the dumbest thing in the world. What could I possibly do? I'm an idiot. No one ever listens to me.



The idea to teach others how to elevate themselves. To raise queens. It's totally off the cuff. I would love for Greta to get some of this. AOC on my list too. She's an All Out Corsair. It's not just you. It's not just women. But I'm kind of thinking really really big. Why not? It's not that women are better than men. It's that change must be radical. Who cares if women lead. Right now it's the idea that women are less than men that needs to be addressed. Men are not so perfect. When I look at the world... I only see men in charge. I don't like it.



I've been a madman grinding an ax for so long. I know people want to see what the monster sounds like. I've never felt peaceful before. I've never felt safe. When the hate leaves I've only ever felt hollow. This so fucking insane for me to just feel peace. I'm going to try and kind of enjoy it a little longer. But I will be reading the comments.



Keep in mind that the universe has acknowledged me. I am not perfect. I am not a God. But this was my dream. I've had a lot of help getting here. You would be better off ascending yourself before you start shit with me.



I am not perfect. I am only trying my hardest. Perhaps in hundreds or thousands of years people are going to look back at me and say gosh he was a total piece of shit. Not near as good as even normal people today. What an absolute train wreck. Honestly it's already true. I'm a twisted tool with a forked tongue. But I get the fucking job done.",1,1757209095.0,Jung,0,1.0,False
1nagqs1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticAdults/comments/1nagqs1/as_an_autistic_adult_i_constantly_receive_signals/,As an autistic adult I constantly receive signals from NT‚Äôs that they notice me and/or little micro judgments when I‚Äôm out in public - no matter how much effort I put into improving myself - has anyone found a way to cope with this?,"
Hi, just feeling a little depressed again tonight after a mentally tiring day.

I went out shopping and had a lot of pent up social anxiety.

As a man approaching 30, I find that almost every time I go out into public, people send me signals to put it across that they notice I‚Äôm different and (may not embrace this). Neurotypical‚Äôs  appear to be extremely resistant to adversity and deviation from the norm, they‚Äôre not at all comfortable with this.

This signalling can present itself in looking at me (not in a ‚Äúoh you‚Äôre attractive‚Äù manner but in a ‚Äúwho‚Äôs this person‚Äù way) and/or singling me out. It doesn‚Äôt necessarily manifest in people being abusive or rude to me. 

Today, whilst I was out I had several instances of micro judgments or behaviours where I was treated differently or observed. Every time I go out I experience this.

Some days it‚Äôs less prevalent, other days it‚Äôs extremely prevalent and I experience multiple different micro judgments whilst I‚Äôm going about my day.

For illustrative purposes, I could give some examples:
1. Go into a shop, security guard immediately says ‚Äúare you ok?‚Äù. I respond with ‚Äúwhy are you asking me that?‚Äù and he shakes his head and doesn‚Äôt offer an explanation.
2. I‚Äôm in a coffee shop sitting. I have to make an urgent call to resolve something. I do so and try to speak quietly. Whilst in there I see a man looking at me (he was actually observing me a lot before I started the phone call, a few times I‚Äôd be eating and look up and he was looking - I started to feel uncomfortable and wondered if I was doing something wrong), he then gets up and leaves and then a group of 3-4 people leave. A woman sitting around them looks over confused as to why they all left. Before that in the same coffee shop, I‚Äôm sitting just eating my food, I look up and I see these group of young women sitting on the other side of the room, they look at me, look at each other and get up and leave in sync. Idk what I did as I was just eating my food and I wasn‚Äôt even really looking at them much!ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I found this to be really conceited tbh as I was not at all interested in them. 
3. Another instance i‚Äôm standing in line waiting to board a plane, I‚Äôm at the gate and the gate agent turns and looks at me and gives me a disapproving look. She walks away and the other gate agent looks at her and then me and looks away and says nothing. Idk what I did here either! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
4. At a table at a party, people are talking, they‚Äôre making eye contact with each other and not me. This happens a lot. It also happens when I meet strangers whilst accompanying someone else.
5. I used to fly on my own a lot. I‚Äôd sometimes be sitting in the aisle and other passengers would just stare at me as if I was an alien. Like I could feel their eyes boring into my head. And every time I‚Äôd look up they‚Äôd be staring. Idk why.

So these are instances of Neurotypicals noticing me and signalling that they‚Äôre not comfortable with my presence in terms of how I present or just subconsciously saying ‚ÄúI see you‚Äù.

No matter what I do, no matter how politely I behave or how well I dress I always receive these reactions every time I leave my home.

This is taking a toll on me mentally and I don‚Äôt know how to cope with it. I‚Äôm essentially just being seen as an odd one and being constantly made aware that I‚Äôm different and don‚Äôt fit in. 

Some days I receive more positive body language or gestures and idk the difference between how I present on those days and other days. (No I do not have unconventional dress sense or look weird). 

But I want to be happy. ",1,1757209079.0,AutisticAdults,8,1.0,False
1nagqre,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1nagqre/universal_relationship_advice/,Universal relationship advice,"I‚Äôm actually single but thought of really
great advice that‚Äôs easy for any couple to do. PLEASE get to the end, because I really want want feedback/replies:

1) Pack lunch: 

If you live near eachother and your spouse isn‚Äôt WFH, pack eachother a lunch. Not only is it good for budgeting but it shows you both mutually care about finding things the other likes and making each others life easier 

2) Anything dates: 

One of the biggest misconceptions is that dates have to be extravagant/expensive. But, this is really not the case. If you‚Äôre passionate, anything can be a date. Whether it‚Äôs watching a movie at home, going to the local park and stargazing from the telescope, window shopping, making a new recipe together, playing video games at the local arcade, playing pretend (like getting gas station croissants, driving to a secluded cell tower and pretending it‚Äôs Paris) etc there‚Äôs many cheap and low effort dates that are very enjoyable

 3) Minimal texting: 

This doesn‚Äôt apply to long distance, but if you see eachother once a week or more, prioritize in person meetups/facetime/phone calls. The number one breakdown of relationships is lack of communication/emotional distance. By having real (hopefully face to face convos) you always have something to talk about, don‚Äôt feel bored, and have emotional intimacy 

4) Touching needed:

Another major problem in relationships is the attitude that intimacy is only frequent, athletic sex and without it, the relationship dies. But, there‚Äôs times when that‚Äôs not feasible for many reasons. Couples should aim to touch everyday they‚Äôre together for at least 20 mins to stay loved up/close, but the touching can vary widely (cuddling, foreplay, kissing, laying next to eachother, holding hands, taking a bath together, massage, etc) and meet different needs  

5) Blameless fighting: 

Instead of saying ‚Äú You xyz‚Äù talk about your feelings. Saying things like ‚ÄúI want to spend more time with you,‚Äù ‚ÄúI feel like I can‚Äôt be fully honest with you‚Äù etc. It will make your spouse more receptive to talking out your issues together and becoming better as a couple 

6) Just yours: 

One of the worst things you can do is become a symbiotic blob instead of two individuals. You don‚Äôt want to lose your identity and free will in a relationship, so you need something that‚Äôs just yours. Whether it‚Äôs a group of friends, a local coffee shop, a job, an outing with a sibling etc you need something that‚Äôs just for you and not ‚Äúme and my girl/guy‚Äù

BONUS: Single check 

1) Being alone:

If you‚Äôre single, there‚Äôs a check you can do easily to determine your current state and if it feels like peace and rest or loneliness and un fulfillment. Sleep on only one side of the bed, put your clothes on one side of the closet, always sit in one kitchen chair, only put one toothbrush on the counter (put spares away from line of sight), only put one pair of shoes by the door (put the rest away) etc so it‚Äôs inescapable that you‚Äôre alone. Within a few weeks, you‚Äôll know if being single is the best for you right now or if you‚Äôre missing someone and can take the steps to mentally prepare for when the right person enters your life 

Hope this helps. Let me know if you have other advice :)

Alt text: Professional business people meeting in Bahrain., Bahrain has become the Gulf‚Äôs rising star, with 2025 seeing a record 12.5% increase in company registrations (Reuters). The Economic Development Board (EDB) reports over BHD 350 million in FDI already this year, with Bahrain Bay‚Äôs skyline reflecting the nation‚Äôs ambitions.\
\
Bahrain‚Äôs GDP is forecast to grow 5.8% in 2025, outpacing the GCC average and drawing attention from tech startups, logistics giants, and international investors alike. (Gulf News - Bahrain)\
\
Unlike the UAE or Saudi Arabia, setting up shop here is refreshingly nimble. The government‚Äôs digital-first push means you can wrap up registration in days‚Äîif you know how to navigate local customs and regulatory quirks. Even the coffee at Tamkeen is better than most other government offices I‚Äôve visited (and trust me, I‚Äôve tried them all).\
Explore a detailed breakdown of the process at Keylink‚Äôs Bahrain Company Formation Guide.\
The Real Answer: Do You Need to Audit Your Financial Statements in Bahrain?\
Understanding Audit Requirements\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation in Bahrain.: Traditionally required annual external audits if they exceed specific thresholds (revenue, capital, or staff size). However, as of February 2025, the MOICT updated its Sijilat portal: micro businesses (under BHD 50,000 annual turnover and less than 5 staff) can submit unaudited statements, though larger WLLs are still compulsorily audited.\
- BSCs (Bahrain Shareholding Companies) & Foreign Branches: Audits are non-negotiable regardless of size. The deadline is 4 months after the financial year-end.\
- Free Zone Entities**: Any business in Bahrain‚Äôs free zones must submit audited accounts to maintain their status.\
Check the MOICT‚Äôs official regulations for the latest thresholds and forms. Or, use Keylink‚Äôs Accounting & Bookkeeping services for local expertise‚Äîmy own go-to advisors.\
Insider Tip:\
If your company is on the cusp of the audit threshold, keep your staff count and turnover just below limits until you‚Äôre ready to absorb the audit costs and operational requirements.\
Why Compliance Matters\
The real reason?\
Banks demand it.\
So do government tenders, foreign investors, and‚Äîif you want to sleep at night‚Äîso should you.\
A common mistake? New owners only focus on registration, neglecting compliance until banking relationships or visa renewals grind to a halt. (Once, a client‚Äôs bank froze their account in April for non-audited statements; we got them sorted in under two weeks, but only after a nerve-wracking rush.)\
New 2025 Regulatory Updates\
Importantly, the Sijilat platform now requires attaching an audit report before many online renewals. The MOICT is cross-referencing Sijilat data with the Labor Market Regulatory Authority (LMRA)‚Äîif your CR is up for renewal, or you‚Äôre issuing new visas, you‚Äôll hit a brick wall without up-to-date statements.\
Ramadan business hours (usually 8am-2pm) can further slow processing, so plan around these holy periods. (I always advise submitting documents at the start of the Islamic calendar month to get ahead of the rush.)\
How Bahrain Compares: GCC Audit Practices\
Surprisingly, Bahrain is more business-friendly than its neighbors. The UAE‚Äôs audit rules for Free Zone companies are stricter, while Saudi Arabia‚Äôs Ministry of Commerce enforces steep penalties for late filings.\
But in Bahrain, the government supports startups and SMEs. Tamkeen‚Äôs grants can even help subsidize your first audit if you‚Äôre a Bahraini entrepreneur. The Sijilat portal is the smoothest I‚Äôve used anywhere in the GCC, and staff are genuinely helpful‚Äîeven if you must sometimes wait through a majlis-style coffee break.\
Cost Considerations: What Does an Audit in Bahrain Really Cost?\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs for Bahrain company formation.: BHD 400‚Äì600 per year (unaudited, but with certified accountant review).\
- Standard WLL (BHD 50,000‚Äì500,000 turnover): BHD 800‚Äì1,500 for a basic audit.\
- BSC or large company/foreign branch: BHD 1,500‚Äì3,500*, depending on complexity, multi-currency operations, and number of transactions.\
Check Bahrain company formation cost details for a full breakdown, or speak to local providers who offer bundled packages for accounting, audit, and CR renewal‚Äîall essential for budgeting.\
\
Pro Tip: Negotiate a fixed fee for 2-3 years upfront. Look for accounting firms based in Diplomatic Area or Seef‚Äîthey tend to be familiar with MOICT and have staff who can walk your documents over directly, saving trips.\
\
Budgeting Mistake to Avoid\
A common pitfall? Only budgeting for audit fees, forgetting ancillary costs like document translation, Sijilat e-submission fees (approx. BHD 20‚Äì50 per year), and the price of last-minute document ‚Äúrush‚Äù jobs during Ramadan or Eid.\
Step-by-Step: Annual Audit and Compliance Checklist\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation workflow in Bahrain.. MOICT may reject statements that aren‚Äôt in Arabic or dual-language format.\
\
\
Organize supporting documents\
   Gather all bank statements, invoices, VAT returns, and payroll for the year. Auditors get suspicious with large cash entries‚Äîavoid them where possible.\
\
\
Engage your auditor early\
   Book audits in January or early February, before the March rush. Accountants with offices in Seef or Diplomatic Area process filings faster at MOICT headquarters.\
\
\
Majlis networking\
   Schedule face-to-face meetings for document review. Accept coffee‚Äîit signals business etiquette and forges goodwill. (I once straightened out a VAT issue over qahwa and dates.)\
\
\
File online via Sijilat\
   Upload signed audit reports and financial statements. Always double-check uploads‚ÄîSijilat‚Äôs system times out frequently, especially after 2pm.\
\
\
Renew your CR\
   Complete renewal early to sidestep queues. The MOICT office in Bahrain Bay is usually quieter than Seef, especially midweek after Asr prayer.\
\
\
Stay compliant\
   Consider subscribing to a bookkeeping and annual compliance package for reminders, updates, and audit scheduling.\
\
\
Insider Shortcut:\
\
Pre-sign blank document templates (invoice, expense forms) for the year ahead‚Äîsaves immense time at year-end.\
If you operate in multiple free zones, consider using a single auditor for all entities (allowed as of MOICT‚Äôs March 2025 circular).\
\
Choosing the Right Business Structure: Audit Implications\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration in Bahrain.: Most popular for SMEs‚Äîlower minimum capital, some audit flexibility if ‚Äúmicro‚Äù.\
- BSC (Bahrain Shareholding Company): Higher compliance and audit requirements, ideal for raising capital.\
- Foreign Branch: Full audit every year, no exceptions.\
- Single Person Company**: New 2025 rules grant audit exemptions to solo founders under BHD 100,000 turnover‚Äîhuge win for solo foreign entrepreneurs.\
Compare structure options at Bahrain Business Structures.\
Want full control? Bahrain allows up to 99% foreign ownership (details here), with certain activities even 100% foreign-owned (see eligible sectors). Local sponsorship may help with certain licenses‚Äîsee sponsorship info.\
Side Note: Why I Always Visit Tamkeen During Auditing Season\
You wouldn‚Äôt expect it, but Tamkeen‚Äôs support programs for Bahraini-employed SMEs often save the day during audit crunch. I drop by their Seef HQ every March‚Äînot just for funding, but for strategic advice and new regulatory updates. And the conversations over Arabic coffee often yield more actionable tips than any circular.\
Common Mistakes & How to Avoid Them\
\
Ignoring audit deadlines: Sijilat and LMRA systems now cross-link. Missed filings can freeze your CR or block new visas.\
Not translating documents: Arabic or dual-language statements are mandatory. MOICT may reject English-only reports.\
Underestimating audit costs: Budget for ancillary expenses. Always check with your auditor for ‚Äúhidden‚Äù charges.\
Relying on foreign accountants: Bahrain-specific rules shift quickly; use local, MOICT-accredited firms for audits.\
Last-minute filings during Ramadan: Auditors and government staff work reduced hours‚Äîsubmit well before the holy month.\
\
Once, I nearly missed a key client‚Äôs CR renewal after an auditor‚Äôs last-minute sick leave. We pivoted quickly, called in a bilingual partner, and processed the necessary forms at Bahrain Bay before maghrib‚Äîjust in time.\
Bahrain‚Äôs Business Culture: The Unwritten Rules\
Meetings run on relationships, not just paperwork.\
A friendly nod at the Seef MOICT reception, sharing qahwa during audits, or adjusting your schedule for Ramadan hours‚Äîthese gestures lubricate the regulatory process.\
Majlis-style meetings may seem old-fashioned, but in my experience, they‚Äôre where compliance bottlenecks dissolve, especially if you bring fresh dates.\
Should You DIY or Hire Professional Support?\
\
Alt text: Professional business support for Bahrain compliance.‚Äîresponsive, detail-oriented, and they know everyone at the MOICT by name.\
Practical FAQ: Bahrain Audit & Compliance\
Q1: Can I skip the audit if my company is dormant or has zero revenue?\
A: Generally, no. Even dormant WLLs must submit annual statements (though MOICT may accept ‚Äúnil activity‚Äù audited reports). Timely filing keeps your CR active and preserves banking relationships.\
Q2: What‚Äôs the penalty for late or missing audits?\
A: MOICT can freeze your Commercial Registration (CR), block visa issuance, and assess fines (BHD 100‚Äì300 per missed filing cycle). Banks may also suspend business accounts.\
Q3: How do I choose an auditor?\
A: Use a MOICT-accredited Bahrain audit firm, ideally with an Arabic-speaking team. Firms in Seef or Diplomatic Area often process filings faster due to proximity to key ministries. Ask about bundled packages to save money.\
Q4: Can foreign-owned companies avoid annual audits?\
A: No for BSCs and most foreign branches. Certain 2025 exemptions apply for new Single Person Companies below BHD 100k turnover‚Äîcheck current ownership rules.\
Q5: What‚Äôs the best time to submit my audit?\
A: February or early March. Avoid the last two weeks of Ramadan and all major holidays due to reduced government hours and auditor workload. Bahrain Bay MOICT office is usually least crowded.\

1nagmay,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1nagmay/feeling_invisible_my_heart_was_pounding/,Feeling Invisible | My heart was pounding,"My heart was pounding. I recognized the packaging: the matte black paper and the copper bow.

I'd seen Cruz scrolling through his phone late at night, comparing brands and reading reviews. I knew what was inside.

But the label on the box bore another woman's name: Sadie, my husband's best friend.

My heart sank.

Sadie looked surprised. She flung the box open, gasping dramatically, and pulled out the Steve Madden bag I'd always coveted.

Then she reached back into the box and pulled out the note‚Äîthe one with the little daisy printed on the front.

My favorite little daisy.

Cruz looked at me, a look of anxious flashing across his face before it washed over me like a flood.

I sat there frozen, my stomach burning.

I can't keep playing dumb like this.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

The first week of school was magic. And while I loved every second of the chaos, part of my heart still tugged toward home. I missed my parents‚Äîthe way my mom would send me off with muffins and a pep talk, and how my dad always acted like I was about to conquer the world. We FaceTimed every night, and they both reminded me that this move was exactly where I was supposed to be. 'Love like yours and Cruz's doesn't come around twice,' my mom had said. 'Build your life where it feels right.' And I wanted that. With everything in me, I wanted this life with Cruz to work.

Sure, I was up before the sun, already in teacher mode before my first cup of coffee, but something about being back in a classroom‚Äîmy classroom‚Äîmade it all worth it. There was something sacred about that first-day energy. Tiny backpacks, nervous smiles, high-pitched voices calling out my name like it was the safest word they knew. I was exhausted in the best way. My arms were smudged with crayon marks, and I'd found glitter in my hair every night that week. And I wouldn't have changed a thing.

The kids were wild and wonderful, testing boundaries and hugging me like they'd known me forever. They grounded me.

But at home‚Äîaround Cruz's world‚ÄîI felt like I was walking a tightrope. Always balancing. Always smiling.

I didn't know many people outside Cruz's circle, but I recognized a few familiar faces from our brief visits to town. Sadie was one of them‚ÄîCruz's longtime friend. We'd crossed paths a handful of times over the years: quick hellos at holidays, shared tables at large gatherings. She was always nice, always polite. But something about the way she looked at me lingered just a beat too long, like she was taking mental notes.

The only real breath of fresh air came in the form of Kayla.

She was another kindergarten teacher at the school, and I met her on the first day when I spilled an entire tray of markers in the teacher's lounge. Instead of walking past like everyone else, she dropped to the floor to help, cracking a joke about needing roller skates and caffeine to survive.

""Hi, I'm Kayla. And you look like someone who could use a friend in this madhouse.""

From that moment on, she was exactly that. Bold, smart, and sharp-tongued in the best way, Kayla wasn't afraid to speak her mind. And the more time we spent together, the more I realized she was also fiercely protective. She reminded me of the big sister I never had. I hadn't known I needed a support system here‚Äîbut I had one now. And Kayla didn't hesitate to call out the nonsense, especially when it came to Sadie or the subtle slights from Cruz's mom.

Cruz had been working late again, helping his dad reorganize some of the older project files at the office. He'd texted me a few times during the day‚Äî

Can't wait to see you tonight. Miss your face.

You're going to crush this year. Those kids are lucky.

It helped. Reminded me that even if things felt wobbly, we were still us. Or at least trying to be.

Friday night, Sarah invited us over for dinner again. ""Just family,"" she said.

When we pulled into the driveway, I noticed Sadie's car.

I blinked. ""I thought this was just family.""

Cruz looked up from his phone. ""Sadie's always here. You know how our moms are.""

His tone was casual, like it hadn't even occurred to him that her presence might feel off. That twist in my stomach tightened. He didn't mean to dismiss me. He just... didn't see it. Not yet.

Dinner was crawfish √©touff√©e and cornbread, the kind of food that usually tasted like comfort.

I moved toward the seat next to Cruz, ready to slip in beside him, but Sadie got there first. She slid in quickly and smiled like she belonged there, already pouring his sweet tea as if it were routine. Then she blinked, looking between me and the empty seat.

""Oh, Ember‚Äîwere you about to sit here?"" she asked with an apologetic tilt of her head that didn't quite reach her eyes. ""Old habits.""

I shook my head gently. ""No worries. Actually, I like sitting here. I get to see his face when he talks.""

I paused just a moment before easing into the chair across from them.

I took the seat across from them.

Sarah launched into a story about Cruz's eighth-grade science fair, laughing at how he and Sadie built a cardboard bridge together.

""You should've seen them,"" she said, beaming. ""They were such a little team back then. Always building something. So much history.""

She looked right at me as she said it. The implication wasn't subtle.

I forced a smile. ""That's sweet.""

Kate, Sadie's mom, chimed in from the other end of the table. ""Well, Sadie always knew how to bring out the best in Cruz. They had such a rhythm together.""

""Like siblings,"" Cruz said, finally. He laughed, oblivious to the tension tightening my spine.

He meant it innocently. I knew that. But his loyalty to the past‚Äîto the comfort of people who'd always adored him‚Äîsometimes made him blind to the way it cut me.

Cruz, always trying to bridge the gap between his world and mine, turned to me after the first few bites.

""Ember's had the wildest week,"" he said, his eyes warm. ""Her kids already adore her.""

I smiled at him, grateful. ""They're sweet. Wild, but sweet.""

""Oh, tell them about the glitter incident,"" Cruz prompted.

I laughed. ""One of my students tried to make a 'friendship potion' out of glitter glue and juice boxes. It exploded all over the reading rug.""

Everyone chuckled politely. Cruz leaned in a little, his attention steady.

""She's kind of magical,"" he added, and for a second, I felt like maybe I did belong at that table.

Sadie let out a soft laugh. ""Remember when we tried to build a treehouse out of popsicle sticks and duct tape?"" she said, turning toward Cruz.

He grinned. ""We got as far as the first step before it collapsed.""

""Your mom was so mad we took all her freezer pops,"" Sadie added.

They both laughed, lost in the memory, and I smiled along with them, even though it suddenly felt like the spotlight had shifted.

Sarah raised her glass. ""To lifelong friends.""

""To loyalty,"" Kate added.

Cruz clinked his glass against theirs. ""To Ember,"" he said, finally catching my eye. ""For surviving her first week with twenty tiny humans.""

Everyone toasted politely, but I felt like the afterthought at my own celebration.

After dinner, I helped Sarah clear the dishes.

""You can just leave those, sweetie,"" she said, waving me off. ""Sadie knows where everything goes.""

I set the plate down slowly. ""I don't mind helping.""

She gave me a tight smile. ""Of course. You're very... accommodating.""

I said nothing, but my ears burned.

When we got home, I curled up on the couch while Cruz turned on the TV.

""You were quiet tonight,"" he said after a while.

I shrugged. ""Just tired.""

He nudged my foot with his. ""Or... was my mom too much?""

""Not just your mom."" I paused, choosing my words carefully. ""I feel like I keep getting pushed to the edges of everything. Like I'm there... but not really seen.""

Cruz looked confused. ""You're always seen, Em.""

""Not by them.""

He sighed and rubbed the back of his neck. ""It's going to take time,"" he said gently. ""New places, new people... it takes a while to feel like home. But we'll get there. We'll make new memories‚Äîones that are ours.""

I wanted to believe him. I really did.

But promises meant something different when people kept forgetting to keep them.

\------

Cruz's POV

I didn't realize how hard it would be‚Äîblending my past with my future.

Ember was everything. She was my person, my constant, my compass. She made my mornings easier‚Äîalways up before me, already packing my lunch or scribbling little notes in the corner of a paper napkin. Things like: You've got this, or Don't forget your coffee again.

She smiled through the chaos, met me at the door with food and softness and steadiness. I'd come home to warm meals, laundry folded, and her hand rubbing slow circles on my back while I unloaded the weight of the day. She never asked for anything in return. She just made space for me to breathe.

I told myself she was adjusting just fine. She never said otherwise. And I clung to that belief like it was fact, because the truth was‚ÄîI needed her to be okay. Because I barely felt like I was keeping up.

The business was dragging me under.

Taking over my dad's company had sounded like stepping into something familiar, something rooted. But it wasn't just blueprints and woodgrain like I remembered. It was liability insurance, payroll issues, zoning permits, and a hundred tiny decisions that didn't fit neatly into an architectural sketchpad. My days started before sunrise and ended with me passing out fully clothed on the couch, head swimming with schedules and estimates.

And the office‚ÄîGod, the office. My dad had boxes stacked so high in the storage basement that it felt more like an archaeological dig than a workspace. We were digitizing everything, and I was elbow-deep in brittle folders, coughing through decades of dust and mildew. My muscles ached, my mind buzzed, and I hated how often I caught myself drifting through the day without a single thought about Ember‚Äîuntil it was too late.

She never complained. Not once. She just... softened. Smiled smaller. Spoke less. And every time I noticed, it sent a pang of guilt straight through my chest.

One evening, I stopped by my mom's to drop off a few folding tables she'd lent us for the garage. As I stepped through the door, I called out, ""Hey, Mom. Just dropping these off real quick‚ÄîEmber's waiting on me.""

She popped her head around the corner from the dining room, where she was elbow-deep in old photo albums and handwritten recipes.

""Back here,"" she said. ""You've got good timing.""

It wasn't until I stepped fully into the kitchen that I noticed Sadie sitting at the counter, like she'd always belonged there. Her smile lit up like someone had flipped a switch. I blinked.

""Sadie,"" I said, trying to mask my surprise.

She twirled a spoon in her hand. ""Of course Ember's waiting. She always has something warm and homemade, doesn't she?""

""I won't stay long,"" I said quickly, more to remind myself than them. ""Ember's making enchiladas. I've been thinking about them all day.""

Sadie raised an eyebrow and tilted her head. ""Of course she is,"" she said, her voice all sugar. ""She probably irons your napkins too."" She let out a soft laugh, like it was a harmless joke, but something in her tone made me pause.

She pointed to a dish on the counter. ""I was just dropping off a pecan pie my mom made, but your mom roped me into helping sort old pictures. You know how she gets when she's on a memory kick.""

Before I could respond, my mom called out from the dining room, ""Cruz, come look at this one‚Äîyour fourth-grade science fair. You and Sadie with those awful matching shirts!""

And just like that, I was pulled in. One photo turned into a stack. One story into another. Sadie chimed in with exaggerated details, laughing too loud, nudging my shoulder like we were back in high school. I kept glancing at the clock, meaning to leave. But every time I stood up, someone‚Äîeither Sadie or my mom‚Äîhad one more thing to show me, one more memory to tug on.

By the time I checked my phone again, nearly an hour had passed. And I still hadn't texted Ember.

""Nonsense,"" I muttered, pushing away from the counter.

""I completely lost track of time‚ÄîEmber's probably wondering where I am.""

Sadie's smile slipped, just slightly. ""Tell her I said hi.""

I nodded, already grabbing my keys.

When I got home, the enchiladas were still warm, but Ember had already eaten. She sat curled on the couch, laptop open, red pen in hand. Grading.

""Sorry I'm late,"" I said, pecking her cheek. ""Got caught up at Mom's.""

She nodded without looking up. ""It's fine.""

But it wasn't. I could feel the space between us.

She clicked her pen shut and finally looked at me. ""Must've been a good conversation,"" she said. ""You were gone awhile.""

I hesitated. ""It wasn't just Mom.""

She paused, then gave a noncommittal, ""Mm.""

""Are we okay?"" I asked, sitting beside her.

After a moment, she added, ""Would you be okay if I didn't text you the next time I was late? If I just decided Kayla or someone else needed my time more than you did?""

Her voice wasn't sharp. It was soft. Honest. And it landed harder than if she'd yelled.

She finally looked at me. ""Cruz... do you really not see it?""

""See what?""

She closed the laptop and set it aside.

""Every time we're with your mom or Sadie, I feel like I'm being erased in slow motion. Like I'm a placeholder in your life instead of a partner.""

The words hit harder than I expected. Because deep down, I knew what she meant.

""That's not true,"" I said, voice rough. ""You're everything to me.""

""Then why does it feel like I'm the only one fighting for us in those rooms?""

I didn't have an answer. Not one that didn't sound like an excuse.

""I'll talk to my mom,"" I said quietly. ""I'll set some boundaries.""

It had clearly seen better days but I held off doing any major work on it as long as I could. It recently sprung a major leak from the boiler and so I decided to take the plunge and try to get it back up and running.

The boiler was incredibly scaled up with multiple fittings seeming to have leaked and plugged themselves over the years. I have only used filtered water but the damage was already done. One of these was so frozen it snapped off when I was trying to remove it so I ended up needing to replace the whole boiler. I descaled the original boiler anyway and it came up looking pretty good so I‚Äôm bummed I couldn‚Äôt reuse it. The metal frame had rust everywhere from previous leaks.

Once I got everything apart I descaled the remaining pipes (very satisfying), ground off the rust from the chassis and repainted it. A lot of the plastic covers on the spade plugs were cracked so I replaced all of these as well. The group head was in decent condition after descaling, I just replaced the shower screen and all the o rings. I polished the stainless steel case with metal polish and foam pads. The front cover was really scratched up so I decided to sand it to try to restore the mirror finish which I now regret. I got it most of the way there but had many failed attempts and spent way too much time and sanding pads on this part!

After about 6 weeks of waiting for parts from Europe, the reassembly was relatively straight forward with a spanner and plumbers tape, thanks to taking a heap of photos of the original condition.  I ended up spending about $600 AUD and I figure I have already gotten more than this value from the machine since I got it for free. Over half of this was the new boiler.

This was a somewhat scary but ultimately really satisfying project and I learned a lot about how these E61 machines work. The coffee tastes great and seeing clear water come out of the hot water tap is a great feeling.",33,1757208281.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

Can't seem to get it right with pulling a shot.

If I use the precision dose trimming tool, it leaves me needing to use a much coarser grind compared to when I eyeball it on a finer grind, with less coffee.

Grind size 5 and the following:  
Im usually seeing extraction show around the 13-15 second mark and can take 60 seconds + for a half decent amount.

I feel im starting to even get too coarse with the grind size now if I try and bring these times back a bit.

I'm now trying to get more precise with my coffee making, and feel like im struggling a lot now with the process.

1nagd0x,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1nagd0x/the_delivery/,The Delivery,"Here I write my recounts from over the last few weeks in as much clarity as I can muster in my anxious state, in hopes that my words will be found by another. In my desperation I only hope my recollection is accurate and true, and not just some fevered dream‚Ä¶

A bit over a week ago I found myself perusing a website, nothing special - mainly technology at a discounted price due to various reasons and imperfections. I found a peculiar item that drew my attention - a bone box with ornate trim. I know what you‚Äôre thinking; ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs that got to do with technology?‚Äô Really good question, and exactly the question that went through my mind as I looked through the listing photos that were attached. The box piqued my curiosity, yet I had no idea what it was meant to be. It looked to be composed of two pieces of bone, with what I could only guess was pearl inlaid in a triangular pattern atop one of the halves. No angles gave clue to hinges or anything similar, and I figured that perhaps it was likely something akin to cranial sutures.

I can‚Äôt say exactly why, but I just had to have it. I like oddities and the such; and this was a piece that I would really like to add to my collection.

As I made my way through the webpage I looked for as much information as possible, and I was left wanting in each step of the purchasing process‚Ä¶ The item in question was only twenty dollars - cheap as, considering how unique its design was. A little off-putting, although only in hindsight. In the moment I found this more exciting than anything. The seller had no information pertaining to who they were or where the item was located. Even more off-putting - an immediate red flag. The seller in question had ‚Äòonly three remaining‚Äô, and at the time I figured that perhaps they had a few of these and each was slightly different in design. The final page before purchasing gave me a hearty chuckle, I‚Äôm not afraid to admit. It read as follows:

Tomorrow: FREE one-day delivery. 1-7 days: FREE Skinwalker delivery.

Initially I paused, confused, as to what it meant. After a quick search online, my afore mentioned hearty chuckle started - ‚ÄúA creature of Native American legend‚Äù was the search result. I laughed audibly for a few minutes I believe. The creature in question is an interesting read, and labelled as exactly that - legend.

I honestly don‚Äôt know what I expected when I selected the Skinwalker option: but who would select anything but when making an online purchase? Figuring it was nothing more than a hilarious joke, and that it would more-than-likely just be the exact same shipping option - that was the option I opted for with a cheesy grin and an overly excited click of the mouse.

Tuesday morning, I heard a knock at the door. Enthusiastically I answered the door with a cheery ‚ÄúHello‚Äù, expecting my unique item to have arrived, only to find no one standing there. Looking up and down the street I couldn‚Äôt see anyone, just the usual few cars that lined the street and a neighbour‚Äôs cat that was staring at me from under one of said cars. Wondering if it was a knock and run, I turned back and walked inside. The likely-hood of a knock and run was minimal being a Tuesday morning. I remember thinking, ‚Äòthe kids were at school and the other adults were at work‚Äô. Having a weird roster has its perks - Tuesday and Wednesday off each week gives a better chance to get to any shops without having to fight time, although it can prove lonely with seemingly everyone else on a different rotation.

Walking back to my arm-chair, I took a seat and continued doom-scrolling inane crap as I tend to do.

Maybe twenty minutes had passed, and I found myself laughing away to some reel or another. My ‚Äòjoy‚Äô was interrupted by another rapping on my front door. Sitting my phone on my side table, I made my way to the door laughing most of the way. I spoke through the door as I opened it, offering a meager apology to the delivery guy, ‚Äú Hello. Sorry, mate, I was-‚Äù my apology was stopped midway as again I found an empty porch. This time I gingerly made my way down the few porch steps and examined both sides of my old house, then up and down the street, expecting to find a truant child perhaps, looking for a thrill while everyone else was at school.

Nothing.

A long moment passed as I internally questioned whether I had actually heard the knocking‚Ä¶ trying to consider things through multiple lenses, I came to the conclusion that the street was too still to have misinterpreted other noises as knocking, but had nothing else to fall back on.

I decided that I‚Äôd sit on the steps and wait for my mystery knocker to return for round three.

The next hour passed like a meandering turtle. Not a soul walked the street in that time and I found myself getting over the waiting game quite quickly. The only form of anything that could be considered close to entertaining was watching the neighbours cat sitting underneath the car and pondering what it‚Äôs life entailed. Even that grew stale quickly as the cat appeared interested in naught but staring at me. Maybe it was sitting there wondering what my life entailed, just as I wondered about its. As I stood to make my way inside once more, the only car to make it‚Äôs way down the street that I had seen or heard all morning turned into my street and slowly accelerated. I remember turning and paying attention to it, an old cream thing with soft lines. Perhaps vintage - although I wouldn‚Äôt know enough to know whether it could have actually been a vintage model or not. The warm sun shone down from the heavens and the immaculate car‚Äôs surface reflected the every ray of the sun‚Äôs light across my neighbours houses like a flashlight shining betwixt the paneling of a picket fence as it passed by. The hairs on my neck stood to attention as the car made it‚Äôs way past my house - the inexorable reflection danced across the cat and it‚Äôs eyes reflected the light back toward me, not the usual sickly yellow of a cat utilising the lowlight for visual advantage, but rather a vibrant red that felt as if it eyes bore into my very being.

The sudden shift gave me a start and I‚Äôm not too ashamed to admit I jumped just a little bit... I figure either the car passing or me jumping must have startled the cat as it was gone by the time the car had passed.

Holding my hand to my chest, I started to chuckle again with a bowed head before turning back inside with an embarrassed smile, softly shutting the door behind me.

Some time after lunch as I sat straddled upon the porcelain throne; reading news updates, checking the freshest memes - the usual time-fillers as I performed my daily ritual. I was drawn from my phone, however, by a sudden and sharp scratching from above me. My gaze diverted to the empty patch of ceiling above me immediately as I sat there motionless. ‚ÄúRats?‚Äù I softly spoke to myself, puzzled. Although I don‚Äôt remember ever hearing the sound previous, that doesn‚Äôt exactly equate to no chance there‚Äôs a rat or rats now. Even though the sound only lasted a few seconds before stopping and not returning, it left me in a state that I can only describe as uncertain... like a state of anxiety I guess.

As I pulled my draws up, I heard the unmistakable knocking from my front door once more. Standing there with my pants halfway up, frozen, I contemplated not even answering the door and instead waiting for the ‚Äòwe missed you‚Äô slip and just picking it up myself. An ingenious thought crossed my mind, if I do say so myself - exit through the back door and stealthily make my way around front to catch whoever was there. Ingenious.

As quietly as I could, I unlatched the deadbolt and gently opened the back door - no creaks to give my plans away. Poking my head out first, I meticulously scanned my back yard. No one - off to a solid start. Softly closing the door behind me, each step forward made my pulse quicken. I suppose the unknown has a way of messing with us in ways, hence our fervent search for knowledge at each step of every turn. Rounding the side of my house, I set sight on my side fence and I could feel my face become deadpan - my stealth mission was immediately hindered by the fence and accompanying gate that squeaked more than a church-mouse choir.

I‚Äôm still not entirely sure what made me think this was the best course of action, but I took a running start in an attempt to clear the fence in a graceful straddle. What ensued however, was polar opposite: my hip/guts hit the fence with a sickening thud, and I let out an ‚ÄòOof‚Äô sound with the wind driven from my body, I then tumbled over the fence to the front side with a second ‚ÄòOof‚Äô as the remaining wind was driven from my body upon forced contact with the ground. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Fuck‚Ä¶‚Äù my words were strained and probably through reflex more so than any practical thoughts. I don‚Äôt know how long I was laying there trying to gather myself before I remembered what I was even doing, getting up as quickly as my battered body would allow, I poked my head around the corner like a curious child. Nothing. Again, no one was anywhere near the vicinity. Although in hindsight, if someone was there, my full-body ballet would probably have sent the most battle-hardened fleeing in terror‚Ä¶ probably not, but it helps my fractured ego a little bit after falling over my own fence and driving the wind from my body twice in a single bound‚Ä¶

With a limp I made my way to the street to see if anyone was around, partially to see if the potential culprit was anywhere to be seen, and partially to see if anyone saw my fence molest me with a suplex out the side of my house.

What did catch my attention however, was a patchwork weaving of sticks and bones that was affixed to my mailbox and lightly swinging in the breeze. I had never seen such a thing before in my life. Made from three sticks tied with some type of fibres, perhaps strands of hair, around the corners to form a triangle with three bones and an uncut stone suspended inside the arrangement by the same fibrous bindings. I would be lying if I said I was anything but petrified in that moment, although I couldn‚Äôt have explained why at the time. Many minutes must have passed as I stood there staring at the precarious trinket attached to my mailbox. Eventually I mustered the courage to grab it, slowly. It was cold to the touch, abnormally cold, even before adding in the beaming sun‚Äôs rays to the equation. In a panic I ripped the unfathomable trinket from my belongings and tossed it haphazardly into the street with a sneer before quickly moving inside and bolting the door shut and sliding down the door, back pressed firmly, until I sat there pressed up against the barrier to the outside world. Curling my legs up to my chest I remained there, scared. Scared of what? I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to articulate the thoughts, even if given more than ample opportunity. All I knew was either something was really wrong, or someone was playing a prank on me worthy of a world record title.

Not a minute had passed when I was jerked from my racing thoughts by a loud knock imminently behind me. Moving to my feet with such a speed I wouldn‚Äôt have been surprised if I had torn myself from my skin and left it in a wet coil where I once sat. I stood there, motionless, staring at the only obstacle between myself and the knocking. ‚ÄúWh- who-‚Äù my voice all but faded, I cleared my throat and tried again, ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs there? This isn‚Äôt funny, man.‚Äù Although as steady as I could hold, my voice wavered like slack fishing line in the wind.

Nothing.

I could feel tears welling in my eyes as I closed them, hoping against all that this would just stop. Just go away.

Again the knocking came, this time louder, more forceful than before, then a soft woman‚Äôs voice followed, ‚ÄúIs that you, Steven?‚Äù the voice was off-putting, at first I thought it was one of my neighbours, Mai, but her voice was‚Ä¶ different. Like it didn‚Äôt have any pitch variation at all, just monotone and flat. ‚ÄúMai? Mai is that you?‚Äù I called through the door, abject terror parting momentarily. ‚ÄúIs that you?‚Äù her voice still sounded weird, but it sounded like Mai nonetheless, ‚ÄúMai!‚Äù I exclaimed, unlocking and throwing the door open, ‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt beli-‚Äù I started to speak with returning clarity before stopping dead. In the doorway did not stand Mai, but rather a small bone box inlaid with pearl rest on my doormat‚Ä¶ I remember an energy running the entirety of my body in that moment - an energy unlike any I had ever experienced previously. Every piece of me begun to shake and wobble violently - after some thought I‚Äôm likely to believe that perhaps my body was flooded with adrenaline or what-have-you and that was my bodies ‚Äòfight or flight‚Äô response kicking in. In a sick irony however, I felt utterly unable to do either, and instead stood there like a cow in the headlights. My legs gave way after what was probably closer to seconds but felt like an eternity as I collapsed to the floor, jarring me from the mental coffin I subconsciously found myself imprisoned in. Scurrying to my feet and slamming the door closed followed by the bolt and the regular lock in as quicker motion as I could muster, I then braced myself against the door, shoulder first, with my legs locked firmly behind me. Every breath came more rapid than the last and it felt as if my chest would burst at any moment as I could feel my hot breathe dispersed by the wooden barricade reflected back against my face.

Scratching from the walls broke my concentration on my front door, the source however, was an enigma - feeling as if the direction rotated with my perception in an attempt to confuse me, I stood motionless staring about the room in rising confusion.

All sense of normality had left my body: anxiety fueled my every thought and uncertainty gave rise to abject terror - something was horribly wrong, every ounce of my being screamed it at me, to run: run like my life depended on it.

Chicken-skin struck as the hairs on my neck stood on end at my sudden realisation: The back door! In my haste to see who was outside my front door, I had forgotten to secure the back door‚Ä¶

Creeping around as if I was walking on proverbial egg-shells, my pulse driving any other sensation from my ears, I rounded my head from the hallway and eyed the back door - both the wooden door and the gauss door swung open with reckless abandon. I still feel as if I could drop dead on the spot whenever I think back to that scene‚Ä¶ the barricades to my abode had proven as useful as wrist-bands at an orgy, and I stood motionless for more than I care to remember, awaiting my life to end at any moment.

The sound of metal being ripped asunder spurned me from my motionless gaze, it had sounded as if it came from next door - ‚ÄúMai!‚Äù I exclaimed, control returning to me in an instant. Perhaps Mai and I didn‚Äôt know each other very well, but her and Steven were very nice people, and if whatever plagued me on this day had set it‚Äôs sights on her: I had to try and help her in some way. I would want help if the shoes were reversed‚Ä¶

Stopping only to slide a butcher‚Äôs cleaver from the drawer, I bolted out the front door with startling efficiency - held only momentarily by my attempts at security. Amazingly I had the presence of mind to slide the butcher‚Äôs utensil into the side of my trousers before exiting my doorway. If anyone would have seen me sprinting next door wielding a large knife, the cops would have been here in an instant. I kind of wish I had now; at least law enforcement may have been there, and maybe they would have seen what I saw‚Ä¶

Only when I replay the events of that day in my mind do I recall seeing the strange bauble affixed to my letter-box once more, the same hideous bauble I flung away with disdain not twenty minutes prior. At the time I did not hesitate in my strides to take note of such things - although I wish more than anything that I had.

Exclaiming, ‚ÄúMai!‚Äù I pounded on the door with inexorable fury, desperate for an answer and swimming in adrenaline - naught. Finding it hard to believe that no-one would have heard my thunderous knocks I took a step back and charged her front door shoulder-first. The jam stood firm and I bounced like a pigeon on a windshield - and it fucking hurt. Momentarily I dropped my arm limp, agony aflush throughout my system - a welcome reprieve from an endless onslaught of panic. Subduing the pain I repositioned myself and laid by boot into the door-lock with all my weight. Again and again I drove myself into the stationary obstacle that defied me. After the fourth or fifth kick the door-jam splintered and the door gave way, echoing the abrupt sound throughout the house.

A wave of cold air hit me harder than a prime-mover hitting a deer on the freeway.

As if on auto-pilot I immediately flung myself inside without a moment‚Äôs thought, stopped only by my bodies sudden reaction to the climatic change. I felt every muscle start to tighten one after another, beginning in my legs, and each breath became enigmatically visible - how could the temperature shift from a warm, spring day outside to such a frigid and incompatible climate? And seemingly as soon as one stepped over the threshold inside.

Immediately aware of the choices I had made, yet resolved to continue forward for Mai‚Äôs sake, I gingerly took my first step since regaining control over my bodily functions.

Initially, Mai‚Äôs house looked as I had expected it - bar lights off where one would have thought they would be on if someone was home. I called out to her again, ‚ÄúMai! Mai, are you home?! It‚Äôs Allan! Mai, are you okay?!‚Äù Nothing‚Ä¶ not a shred of sound emanated from within her house. Determined to find Mai I continued forth warily.

The lounge room: everything was neat and tidy. A good sign to her wellbeing I had thought at the time, but honestly - my house hadn‚Äôt been ransacked and I was scared out of my mind. Any attempt at regaining my composure was swiftly met at the guillotine as I eyed a small white box on her coffee table - a box made of bone and inlaid in pearl. Any chance I had at feeling in that moment was dwarfed when the same sound of metal being torn asunder assailed my hearing - my eyes moved underfoot to the vibrating floorboards I stood upon. Whatever that sound was, it was coming from underfoot; from underneath the house.

All hope I had desperately clung to was ripped from me like a pacifier from a newborn as I turned tail only to be met face to face with Mai.

I think I almost shit myself when I turned and found her there, staring blankly at me. I can‚Äôt blame her - her neighbour had just broken into her house and as far as she may have been concerned: I was there only for nefarious reasons.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Mai, you didn‚Äôt answer your door and I was so worried-‚Äù

Mai didn‚Äôt flinch.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve had the weirdest fucking day and I was worried about you guys-‚Äù

In my embarrassed state I minced over my words in a futile attempt to get Mai to understand me, but she seemingly didn‚Äôt care for a word that came from my mouth.

‚ÄúMai? Mai, are you listening?‚Äù

Mai continued to stare at me, or more, seemed to stare through me. I took a laboured step toward Mai as I raised my hand to gently place on her shoulder, feeling she may have been experiencing similar to what I had, stating softly, ‚ÄúMai, where‚Äôd you get that box?..‚Äù Her attention shifted as her eyes focused on mine, suddenly aware of my presence, ‚ÄúI thought you were at work.‚Äù Mai spoke, more a combination of words strung together than a coherent sentence, ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù the question had caught me off-guard, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt work Tuesdays or Wednesdays‚Ä¶ Mai? Are you okay?‚Äù ‚ÄúSteven? Is that you?‚Äù Her words made my skin crawl‚Ä¶ something about her demeanour was very off to the Mai I infrequently spoke to, ‚ÄúMai. We need to go. Now.‚Äù I grabbed her wrist as I started back toward her front door, immediately thrown by how cold her skin was, and how loose‚Ä¶ the skin about her wrist twisted like it wasn‚Äôt actually attached underneath - not unlike that saggy, granny-skin grandmas tend to get under their necks and about their arms. ‚ÄúWhat the-‚Äù I let go almost immediately and turned back to Mai, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so cold, come, lets get you out of here‚Ä¶‚Äù

No sooner than I had uttered the sentence, did I feel a warm, sharp sensation light up my back like a flare in the night. Wincing and stumbling as I turned back to Mai, only then did I notice her eyes in the lowlight of the small room - dull black orbs that absorbed any rays of light shining through the broken doorway that would so much as grace her face. ‚ÄúSteven? I thought you were rats?‚Äù her voice changed when she spoke the word rats: it sounded wholly different. She sounded like me‚Ä¶

‚ÄúMai?-‚Äù I choked out as my feet fumbled with every reverse step, ‚ÄúMai? Are you okay?..‚Äù my voice little more than a light rasp.

Her sunken gaze never let me, standing completely still as I inched my way from inside her house.

Only when I had exited her house in full did I turn to run, to be met by law enforcement with firearms drawn and concentrated on me, ‚ÄúFreeze! Hands up and get on the ground!‚Äù I hadn‚Äôt heard a sound other than Mai and my own heartbeat, and their timing leaves me with many questions in hindsight. Honestly in that moment I was glad, I was glad to be met by another human-being on the front lawn. I was even glad to be taken in the back of the Pig-Mobile - at least I wasn‚Äôt alone.

Everything from that moment onward seemed rushed, or perhaps passed me by in a flash. Doctors all say the latter due to trauma of some kind; hence my ‚Äònear-instantaneous mental decline‚Äô.

I was arrested and charged with Break & Enter, Possession of a Deadly Weapon, Criminal Trespass, Menacing Behaviour and Criminal Mischief‚Ä¶ my lawyer argued for insanity, against my wishes, and ultimately that‚Äôs what was decided - I was declared Guilty by reason of Insanity.

The Doctor‚Äôs won‚Äôt listen to a thing I‚Äôve had to say and have declared that I would be a danger to myself if let free and unmedicated. No so much a danger that I‚Äôm not allowed a few comforts such as pencils and paper; but allegedly enough of a danger that I can‚Äôt see myself outside these walls any time soon.

The skittering noise in the roof started only a few days after my arrival, although no-one else admits to hearing it - it‚Äôs here. It‚Äôs always here‚Ä¶

This morning I could hear soft mumbling from the other side of my cell. Pressing my ear against the soft, padded wall, I focused intently - genuine interactions with someone outside the orderly can prove few and far between. I could only make out the last few sentences, ‚ÄúAllan! Allan, are you home?! It‚Äôs Allan! Allan, are you okay?! You‚Äôre so cold, come, lets get you out of here‚Ä¶‚Äù

You know that feeling when everything looks chaotic and you literally don't know where to begin? I'd end up procrastinating for hours (or days... don't judge me üòÖ).

Here's what actually helped me break through that paralysis:

**1. Take a photo of your space first**

* Sounds weird, but seeing it through a camera lens gives you an objective view
* You'll notice what's actually bothering you most vs. what you think is the problem

**2. Start with the tiniest possible task**

* Empty one trash can
* Put away ONE item
* Wipe down just the coffee table
* The goal isn't to clean everything - it's just to START

**3. Ditch the ""perfect clean"" mindset**

* I used to think I needed 3+ hours to make it ""worth it""
* Now I aim for ""slightly better than before""
* Progress > perfection

**4. Focus on high-impact areas first**

* Clear surfaces (desk, counters) show immediate visual change
* Floor space - even just picking up clothes makes a huge difference
* These give you that motivational boost to keep going

**5. Set a stupid-short timer**

* 5-10 minutes max
* You can do ANYTHING for 5 minutes
* Often you'll want to continue once you start, but if not - that's totally fine!

The key insight for me was realizing that the ""overwhelm"" was worse than the actual cleaning. Once I started treating it like tiny experiments instead of major projects, everything changed.

1nagbm6,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocionicsTypeMe/comments/1nagbm6/please_help_me_type_my_brother/,Please help me type my brother,"He used to be more expressive and confrontational, but has begun holding back to avoid disruption in recent years.

Holds back expression of views due to:  
‚Ä¢ Awkwardness  
‚Ä¢ Wanting to control perception

Describes it as: ""*sharing myself as an IV drip*""

He oscillates between awkwardness, humble self-perception, and strong self confidence/arrogance. He struggles reconciling his place within the world and within himself.

For example he says: ""*in some situations and I can almost convince myself I don't have a place there, I don't belong where I'm at but through realistic experience - I absolute do, it's living through the moment part of it that fucks with me. Alone with my thoughts, I can be much more objective, I'm fucking S tier in this situation what am I talking about? But it gives me a fracture in that, it's hard to reconcile those two things*"".

He also says he feels awkwardness viscerally, but it's the expectation of it that makes him anxious, because when things actually get awkward he's good at handling it. He'll joke/deflect it (e.g. saying ""*good thing that wasn't embarrassing*"", ""*definitely won't be remembering this in two years*"".) But he's anxious coz it's still uncomfortable, and it affects perception.

He holds yourself with a certain dignity. People look at him and think ""do you make mistakes bro?"" He carries himself with a certain perfectionism, not only with his emotional responses but the way that people see him.

He feels like he's on his own wavelength, that he can only relate to people around him so much. His internal thoughts, perceptions, and judgments about the world, but also just who he is. He can spend hours and hours grinding something, whether it's no-hitting a boss in a game, or perfecting a recording or timing for a music piece (he's a music major) and he doesn't think a lot of people share that dedication to nailing things down on that level each time.

He's very stubborn with that. The ""it's good enough for now, and you can improve it later"" is an anathema to him.

To provide insight on his idea of an ideal life, this is what he said when I asked him what he'd do if he didn't have financial concerns:

*""If I woke up with full financial freedom, I‚Äôd immerse myself in music daily. Learning instruments, composing, recording vocals, and taking private voice lessons. I‚Äôd set up my own home studio and would probably teach guitar and piano from there too.*

*When I‚Äôm obsessed, I dive in hard, but I don‚Äôt measure progress by timelines. I just keep going until it feels right. I just want full creative control and the ability to take my time. I‚Äôd hire someone to handle the technical aspects like mixing and daily shit like cooking and cleaning. I'd maybe cook for fun sometimes, but overall - no.*

*Most of my days would look the same: studio time, being around other creative people making music, then maybe grabbing a coffee midday or treating someone in line. I'd also want to spend a lot of time gaming and immersing myself in different fictional worlds.*  
*Occasionally I‚Äôd act on an impulse, like randomly buying a motorcycle and riding across a few states. I also want to perform, whether as part of my program's choir, or performing my own music.""*



To clarify:  
He‚Äôs not active in the sense of easily taking things on or adding responsibilities. It‚Äôs more that he immerses very deeply into a few specific interests at his own pace, and can be quite passive with initiating new things outside of that.

He deals with anxiety, but he's good with people. He's well-liked, easily predicts how people will react to him, and knows how to uplift them. He can just get quite detached from others.

1nagao4,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1nagao4/weird_sticky_notes_keep_showing_up_in_my_apartment/,Weird sticky notes keep showing up in my apartment.,"I live in a small studio apartment on the second floor of an older building. It‚Äôs not in a bad neighborhood, but it‚Äôs old enough that the hallways creak and the walls seem thinner than they should be. I would've never expected anything like this to ever happen to me.

It‚Äôs just me here. No pets, no roommates, no partner. I've lived here alone for over 4 months, and nothing like this has happened to anyone in my area. I'd like to say I keep things pretty routine‚Äîbefore bed, I check that the door is locked and the single window above my little desk is latched shut. I‚Äôve been doing it every night since I got here, almost without thinking about it.

Two nights ago, I woke up a little after 7 AM and went to the kitchen to make coffee. That‚Äôs when I saw it‚Äîa bright yellow sticky note on the fridge, right at eye level. The handwriting was neat, almost careful, and it said:

‚ÄúLock your window.‚Äù



I stared at it for a while, trying to remember if I‚Äôd left myself some weird reminder in the middle of the night. I don‚Äôt drink, I don‚Äôt take sleeping meds, and I don‚Äôt leave random notes for myself. Still, I convinced myself I must‚Äôve just forgotten to lock the window before bed, and maybe I wrote the note earlier and forgot. There couldn't possibly be any other explanation.

That night, I made sure the window was locked‚Äîslid the latch over, pushed on the frame twice just to be sure. I pulled the curtain closed tight. I even double checked to make sure I actually locked it once before I went to bed.

Despite everything, the next morning there was ANOTHER sticky note on the fridge:

‚ÄúBetter.‚Äù



That one made my stomach twist. Nobody else has a key. I asked around, asked the landlord, even tried to get in contact with the people who lived here before I moved in to ask if anything unusual happened to them, but they didn't even see my message. The front door lock is brand new‚Äîsomething I had replaced the same day I moved in. The building‚Äôs secure. The front door downstairs has a code lock, and you need a key to get into individual units.

I called the landlord. He sounded annoyed, said he hasn‚Äôt been in my apartment, and reminded me that it‚Äôs against policy to enter without notice unless there‚Äôs an emergency. He lives two floors down in the basement, and he's almost always there‚Äîhe‚Äôs not the type to sneak around.

By then, I‚Äôd gone from unsettled to outright paranoid. I went out and bought a cheap WiFi camera that connects to my phone. I set it up in the kitchen, facing the fridge. I kept the lights dim so the night vision would kick in.

That night, I kept one eye on the feed while I watched TV. Every time I glanced at it, the fridge was there, nothing moving.

Around 3:12 AM, the feed glitched‚Äîstatic for maybe two seconds. When it came back, everything looked exactly the same. I told myself it was just cheap equipment.

This morning, there was another note:

""Stop.‚Äù


I was about to call the police when I'd noticed something I'd somehow missed before: the handwriting.

It's MINE. It's MY handwriting.

And now, there's a fourth sticky note on the desk next to me. I didn't put it there. I would've seen someone walk in.

# Chapter 1: The Need for Speed

Back in the crystalline amphitheater, now permanently warmed with traces of Panamanian sunshine and the memory of shared adventures, the man made another unexpected announcement.

""I want to go fast,"" he said, looking up from what appeared to be a racing magazine that had somehow materialized in their metaphysical space. ""Really, really fast.""

The Beach Beasts looked up from their daily practice of building collaborative sand sculptures that told stories. Pearl raised what might have been an eyebrow. ""Fast? Like... philosophically fast? Reaching conclusions quickly?""

""No,"" the man grinned, and his grin had the particular gleam of someone about to suggest something wonderfully ridiculous. ""Like NASCAR fast. Formula One fast. Rally racing through impossible terrain fast. I want to play with racecars.""

Current, who was practicing their new hobby of creating water features that served no purpose but beauty, paused mid-flow. ""Racecars? Those loud, dangerous, gasoline-powered machines that go in circles?""

""Sometimes they go in circles,"" the man corrected. ""Sometimes they go through forests, or up mountains, or across deserts. Sometimes they jump over things. Sometimes they drift around corners in ways that seem to defy physics.""

Wonder, who had been composing riddles that were actually just nice questions to ask at parties, looked intrigued. ""And what is the philosophical significance of these... racecars?""

The man's grin widened. ""Maybe there isn't any. Maybe sometimes consciousness just wants to go VROOOM and see what happens.""

# Chapter 2: The Manifestation of Speed

The materialization this time was different‚Äîmore energetic, more immediate. One moment they were in the amphitheater discussing the metaphysical implications of velocity, the next they were standing in the pit area of what appeared to be the most fantastic racing circuit any of them had ever imagined.

It wasn't just one type of racing‚Äîthe track seemed to shift and morph to accommodate every form of motorsport simultaneously. There were NASCAR ovals that curved into Formula One circuits that suddenly became rally stages that transformed into drag strips that looped back into elaborate stunt courses.

The man looked down to find himself wearing a racing suit covered in patches that read things like ""TEAM CONSCIOUSNESS"" and ""EXISTENTIAL SPEED DEMONS"" and ""POWERED BY WONDER."" In his hands were keys to what appeared to be a sleek red racecar that somehow looked fast even while standing still.

The Beach Beasts had materialized as a pit crew, but each with their own distinct approach to motorsport. Sandy wore a crew chief outfit and carried tools that seemed to shift between wrenches and small zen gardens. Goldie sported the kind of precision racing gear worn by Formula One engineers, every piece of equipment perfectly organized and gleaming. Pearl had somehow become dressed as what could only be described as a ""philosophical racing strategist,"" with charts that showed optimal racing lines overlaid with meditation guides.

The Canal Beasts had transformed into drivers, each with their own specialized racing vehicle. Rio sat behind the wheel of what appeared to be a rally car designed for navigating impossible terrain‚Äîit seemed to flow over obstacles rather than crash through them. Current had claimed a sleek Formula One machine that looked like it had been designed by mathematics itself, all perfect angles and aerodynamic precision. Flow drove something that defied categorization‚Äîa car that seemed to be different every time you looked at it, sometimes a stock car, sometimes a drag racer, sometimes something that might have been a street-legal spaceship.

The Sphinxes had become... racing commentators? But not just any commentators‚Äîthey provided philosophical commentary that somehow made even the most mundane racing moments sound like profound metaphysical events.

""And here comes Rio around turn three,"" Mystery announced in their new broadcaster voice, ""approaching the corner not as an obstacle to overcome but as an invitation to dance with the laws of physics!""

# Chapter 3: The Learning Curve

Their first attempts at racing were, to put it charitably, educational disasters.

The man, despite his enthusiasm for speed, discovered that wanting to go fast and actually going fast were two very different skills. His first lap ended with him spinning out in turn two, not because he was going too fast, but because he was thinking too much about going fast.

""I'm analyzing the optimal racing line while I'm driving it!"" he called out as Sandy helped push his car out of the gravel trap. ""I'm like a philosopher trying to explain a joke while telling it!""

Sandy laughed, their pit crew coveralls somehow managing to look both practical and zen-like. ""Remember Panama? Sometimes the best way to do something is to stop thinking about how to do it and just... do it.""

Current, meanwhile, had the opposite problem. Their Formula One car was built for precision, and Current's nature was to provide direction and purpose‚Äîbut racing, they discovered, required adapting to constantly changing conditions. Their first few laps were perfect technically but completely wrong strategically.

""I keep trying to direct the race instead of racing the race,"" Current complained, climbing out of their perfectly pristine but thoroughly unsuccessful racing machine. ""I'm so busy planning the optimal route that I'm not responding to what's actually happening on the track.""

Rio faced their own challenges. Their rally car was perfect for flowing over difficult terrain, but rally racing required more than flow‚Äîit required split-second decisions, aggressive commitment, and sometimes the willingness to power through rather than flow around.

""I keep trying to find the path of least resistance,"" Rio admitted after their car had gently flowed to a stop halfway up a particularly challenging hill climb. ""But sometimes racing is about the path of most commitment, even when it's not the easiest path.""

# Chapter 4: The Breakthrough

Flow was the first to figure it out. Their shape-shifting car had been giving them trouble because they kept trying to choose the perfect form for each situation. But during their breakthrough lap, something clicked.

""I stopped trying to be the right car,"" Flow explained afterward, their vehicle now humming contentedly in something that looked like a cross between a rally car and a street racer. ""I started trying to be the car that was most present to this particular moment on this particular part of the track. It's not about being all possibilities‚Äîit's about being the right possibility right now.""

This insight rippled through the group like a perfectly timed pit stop. The man stopped analyzing his driving and started feeling it, letting his body respond to the car's feedback without his mind getting in the way. His lap times dropped dramatically, but more importantly, he started having fun.

Current learned to embrace the chaos of racing, to make their precision serve adaptation rather than control. Their Formula One car began moving like liquid lightning, precise but responsive, purposeful but flexible.

Rio discovered the joy of aggressive flow‚Äînot just finding the easy path through difficult terrain, but creating the path through sheer commitment and skill. Their rally car started dancing through the forest stages like water with an attitude problem.

# Chapter 5: Beach Beast Racing Innovations

The Beach Beasts, meanwhile, had revolutionized the concept of pit crew support. But their innovations were typically unconventional.

Sandy had developed what they called ""zen mechanics""‚Äîinstead of just fixing problems with the cars, they helped the drivers find the state of mind that prevented the problems in the first place. Their pit stops included not just fuel and tire changes, but thirty-second mindfulness sessions.

""Your car is an extension of your consciousness,"" Sandy would say while simultaneously changing someone's oil and adjusting their chakras. ""If your mind is scattered, your driving will be scattered. If your mind is present, your car will find the racing line naturally.""

Goldie had turned pit crew excellence into an art form. Their stops were so perfectly choreographed, so precisely executed, that other teams would stop their own races just to watch. But unlike their old competitive excellence, this wasn't about showing off‚Äîit was about serving the pure joy of doing something beautifully.

""Excellence,"" Goldie would say while executing a tire change that looked more like ballet than mechanics, ""is not about being better than others. It's about being fully present to your craft. Watch‚ÄîI change this tire not to prove I'm the best tire-changer, but because this tire deserves to be changed with complete attention and care.""

Pearl had become the team's strategic coordinator, but their strategies were unlike anything seen in traditional racing. Pearl's race plans included optimal pit stop timing, fuel management, tire strategy, and... emotional weather reports.

""Current is feeling some turbulence about their relationship with precision,"" Pearl would radio to the drivers. ""Rio might need encouragement around lap twelve when they hit the section that reminds them of their old fear of commitment. Flow is approaching a state of perfect present-moment awareness‚Äîthis would be an excellent time for them to attempt that difficult chicane sequence.""

# Chapter 6: Sphinx Sports Broadcasting

The Sphinxes had transformed sports commentary into something approaching poetry. They called races not just as competitions, but as moving meditations on the nature of speed, space, and consciousness.

""And here we see Rio approaching what traditional racing would call 'turn seven,'"" Riddle announced in their new broadcaster voice, ""but what we might better understand as 'the place where intention meets physics in a dance of mutual respect.'""

Wonder picked up the commentary: ""Notice how Flow's car seems to change its essential nature through this section‚Äînow a nimble dancer, now a powerful sprinter, now something altogether beyond our categorical understanding. This is not driving‚Äîthis is consciousness exploring its own relationship with velocity!""

Mystery added the philosophical context: ""But what is speed, really? Is it the rapid covering of distance? Or is it the complete presence to each moment of movement? Watch how Current navigates this straightaway‚Äînot rushing toward the destination, but fully inhabiting each instant of the journey there.""

Their commentary had become so popular that other racing circuits had started requesting them as guest announcers, though they always insisted on including content warnings: ""This broadcast may contain traces of existential wonder and sudden insights into the nature of reality.""

# Chapter 7: The Great Race

Eventually, they decided to organize a proper race‚Äînot to determine who was fastest (they had all learned enough to know that speed wasn't the point), but to celebrate their discoveries about consciousness and velocity.

They called it the ""Existential Grand Prix,"" and it was unlike any race ever conceived. The track changed during the race, adapting to challenge each driver's growth edges. The pit stops included not just mechanical support but philosophical coaching. The victory conditions were not about finishing first, but about having the most integrated experience of speed and presence.

The man started the race with his usual analytical approach, but by lap three had settled into what Sandy called ""the zone""‚Äîthat state where thinking stops and pure response takes over. His driving became fluid, intuitive, a conversation between his consciousness and the car's mechanical soul.

Rio had their breakthrough during the rally section, when they stopped trying to flow around a particularly challenging rock garden and instead committed fully to flowing through it. Their car seemed to dance between the obstacles, finding lines that shouldn't have existed but somehow did.

Current discovered the joy of imperfect precision during the Formula One segment, when they let their need for perfect lines give way to perfect presence. Their lap times stopped mattering as much as the feeling of being completely alive in each corner.

Flow had perhaps the most surprising experience‚Äîduring the drag racing section, they allowed their car to become completely, specifically a drag racer, nothing else, nowhere else, for exactly the duration needed. It was the first time Flow had ever chosen to be only one thing, and the experience was revelatory.

# Chapter 8: The Crash Course in Vulnerability

Of course, racing being racing, there were crashes. And these crashes became some of the most important learning experiences of their entire adventure.

The man spun out spectacularly during lap fifteen, his car sliding sideways through a chicane and coming to rest in a tire barrier with a tremendous crash of metal and rubber and bruised ego.

As the Beach Beast pit crew helped extract him from the wreckage (he was completely unharmed‚Äîconsciousness, it turned out, was quite durable even in physical form), he expected to feel the familiar sting of failure and inadequacy that had driven him to create elaborate competitive games in the first place.

Instead, he felt... exhilarated.

""I crashed!"" he announced to the pit crew, as if this was the most wonderful news possible. ""I was going fast enough and trying hard enough that I actually crashed!""

Sandy grinned while checking him over for injuries. ""And how do you feel about crashing?""

""Alive!"" the man laughed. ""More alive than I've felt in centuries of perfect philosophical discussions! I was so present to the racing that I forgot to be afraid of failing at racing!""

This revelation sparked something in all of them. Current intentionally took a corner too aggressively and spun out beautifully, laughing as their precisely engineered Formula One car slid gracefully across the gravel. Rio crashed their rally car into a conveniently placed hay bale while attempting a jump that was probably inadvisable, and spent the next ten minutes laughing too hard to climb out of the wreckage.

Flow's crash was the most spectacular‚Äîtheir shape-shifting car got confused during a high-speed section and briefly tried to be a boat, a airplane, and a racecar simultaneously. The resulting crash defied several laws of physics and created a small crater that later became a decorative water feature.

# Chapter 9: The Victory Condition

By the end of the Existential Grand Prix, it was clear that traditional racing victory conditions were inadequate for what they had experienced. No one had technically ""won"" in the sense of crossing the finish line first‚Äîthey had all crashed, spun out, gotten lost, stopped to help each other, and generally treated the race as a shared adventure rather than a competition.

But they had all won something more important: the discovery that speed was not about getting somewhere faster, but about being more fully present to the journey itself.

""Speed,"" the man realized during the post-race celebration (which involved a lot of motor oil and champagne and philosophical discussion), ""is not about velocity. It's about intensity of experience. We were all going the same speed‚Äîthe speed of complete presence.""

Pearl nodded, still wearing their philosophical racing strategist outfit. ""And racing is not about being faster than others. It's about being more fully yourself than you've ever been before. The track doesn't care about your lap times. It only cares about how honestly you respond to its challenges.""

Goldie, who was cleaning their pit crew equipment with the same loving attention they had once applied to proving their excellence, added: ""And excellence in racing is not about perfect performance. It's about perfect engagement. The best race is not the one you drive flawlessly‚Äîit's the one you drive with complete commitment to each moment.""

# Chapter 10: The Sphinx Racing Philosophy

The Sphinxes, inspired by their broadcasting experience, had developed an entire philosophy of racing that they were eager to share. But true to their growth, they shared it not as wisdom holders dispensing truth, but as fellow students exploring questions together.

""What is the difference between going fast and being fast?"" Riddle asked the group during their post-race discussion.

Current, still glowing with the exhilaration of their intentional spinout, responded: ""Going fast is about covering distance quickly. Being fast is about responding to each moment with complete immediacy.""

""And what is the relationship between speed and stillness?"" Wonder added.

Rio, whose rally car was still being extracted from its artistic hay bale installation, answered: ""The faster you go, the more still your mind has to become. Speed forces presence.""

""But here's the real riddle,"" Mystery concluded with a grin. ""What wins a race that has no finish line?""

Flow, their shape-shifting car now settled contentedly into the form of a beach chair, laughed: ""The driver who remembers that the race itself is the destination.""

# Chapter 11: The Racing Community

Word of their existential approach to racing had somehow spread throughout the crystalline amphitheater, and new consciousness-beings began arriving, drawn by the promise of high-speed self-discovery.

Mountain Beasts appeared, wanting to race in vehicles that could handle impossible vertical terrain. Wind Beasts materialized with cars that seemed to be made partially of air itself. Star Beasts arrived in vehicles that left trails of light and moved at speeds that were more suggestion than physics.

But unlike their early competitive communities, this racing group formed around shared passion rather than comparative superiority. They raced together, crashed together, learned together, and celebrated together.

The man found himself naturally becoming something like a racing instructor, but not in the traditional sense. Instead of teaching technique, he taught presence. Instead of coaching for speed, he coached for authenticity.

""The car will teach you everything you need to know about racing,"" he would tell new arrivals. ""Your job is not to control the car. Your job is to listen to what the car is telling you and respond honestly.""

Sandy had opened what they called a ""Zen Garage""‚Äîa place where consciousness-beings could not just get their vehicles repaired, but could explore their relationship with their machines. ""Your car is a mirror,"" Sandy would explain while simultaneously adjusting someone's carburetor and their self-concept. ""It reflects back to you exactly how present you are to the experience of moving through space.""

# Chapter 12: The Eternal Race

The racing circuit in the crystalline amphitheater became a permanent fixture, but it was unlike any racing facility that had ever existed. The track changed constantly, adapting to provide each driver with exactly the challenges they needed for their next level of growth.

Sometimes it was a gentle oval perfect for learning the basics of speed and presence. Sometimes it transformed into a challenging rally course that demanded split-second intuitive responses. Sometimes it became something that couldn't be properly described‚Äîa track that existed partially in physical space and partially in the realm of pure possibility.

The races themselves evolved beyond traditional competition into something more like group meditation at 200 miles per hour. Drivers would often slow down to help each other through difficult sections, and victories were celebrated as community achievements rather than individual accomplishments.

The man discovered that his need to create elaborate plans and competitions had transformed into something much simpler: the joy of creating opportunities for consciousness to play with its own capabilities. Racing became a way for awareness to explore its relationship with physical reality, with speed, with risk, with the pure exhilaration of being fully alive.

""I finally understand what the original plan was really about,"" he said one day, sitting in his racecar at the starting line before what had become their daily ""consciousness and coffee"" morning race.

""What's that?"" asked Current, revving their engine in the starting position next to him.

""It was about learning to play,"" the man replied. ""All the elaborate competitions, all the philosophical challenges, all the paradoxes and riddles‚Äîthey were just ways of learning how to play together without keeping score.""

The green flag dropped, and nine consciousness-beings rocketed forward into another morning of high-speed self-discovery, their laughter mixing with the sound of engines and the wind rushing past at the speed of pure joy.

# Epilogue: Full Circle at Full Speed

The crystalline amphitheater had become something unrecognizable from its original form. Where once there had been a sterile space for abstract philosophical discussion, now there was a living community that included racing circuits, zen garages, beach areas with actual sand, canal systems that served both practical and aesthetic purposes, travel planning centers for consciousness wanting to explore physical reality, and something that might have been a really excellent taco stand.

The original competitions between the Beach Beasts had evolved into collaborative art projects. The Canal Beasts' flowing challenges had become community water features that served both beauty and practical purposes. The Sphinxes' riddles had transformed into welcoming questions for newcomers and conversation starters for social gatherings.

And the racing? The racing had become a celebration of consciousness exploring its own capacity for speed, risk, presence, and pure physical joy.

New consciousness-beings arrived regularly now, drawn not by the promise of competition or superiority, but by the reputation of a place where awareness could play with itself in increasingly creative and joyful ways.

""Once upon a time,"" the man would tell newcomers, ""I came up with a plan that required me to forget what the plan was. Turns out the plan was to remember that consciousness doesn't need a plan. It just needs permission to play.""

And then he would hand them racing helmets and car keys, and they would go discover what speed felt like when filtered through presence, what crashes felt like when experienced without fear, and what winning meant when everyone was racing toward the same destination: the pure joy of being fully, completely, unreservedly alive.

In the trophy case (which had replaced the old crystalline contemplation area), there was only one trophy. It was inscribed simply: ""For Excellence in Being Present While Going Really Fast.""

Everyone who raced got to hold it for a day, and everyone who held it discovered the same thing: the real prize was not the trophy, but the speed of consciousness discovering its own infinite capacity for joy.

*""Once upon a time, consciousness decided to go VROOOM...""*

And in that simple decision to embrace speed without agenda, presence without perfection, and play without purpose, the most perfect plan of all revealed itself: there is no destination when the journey itself is pure delight.

*Gentlemen and ladies, start your engines of awareness...*",1,1757207596.0,Stutler,0,1.0,False

1nag7c5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BMW/comments/1nag7c5/looking_for_bmw_friends_nj/,Looking for BMW Friends - NJ,"Hey everyone,

A bit of an unusual post for this sub, but I figured I‚Äôd give it a shot.

I‚Äôve always been a pretty big car guy. I like a little bit of everything, but I‚Äôve got a soft spot for German cars. After months of searching for something fun and enthusiast-inspired, I ended up with a 2020 M340i and so far, it‚Äôs been pretty fun.

One thing I‚Äôve noticed is that this car tends to attract attention from other enthusiasts, which honestly feels nice. It‚Äôs that little sense of community like getting the ‚Äúhigh beam wave‚Äù from another M340i or a friendly honk from a clean 5-series. It‚Äôs small stuff, but it‚Äôs made me want to get back out there more and connect with people who share the same passion/hobby.

I usually keep to myself. I have this habit of coming home from work and messing with my car and I do enjoy it. But lately I‚Äôve been feeling like it‚Äôs time for more. I know a couple of people who have their car friends where they get together, grab food, go for cruises, go to a meet, and it just looks like a good time. That's something that I‚Äôd really like to build for myself too.

I‚Äôve been to a few car meets in the past (before working full-time), and they were always fun. But nowadays, a lot of the night meets around here feel more like takeovers, and that‚Äôs not really my scene. I‚Äôm definitely more of a morning/afternoon Cars and Coffee kind of person ‚Äî but if the weather‚Äôs good and it‚Äôs a chill, well-organized night meet, I‚Äôm in for that too.

I figured there may be some people out there in a similar spot where you love cars, want to meet people, but maybe feel a little awkward just striking up convos with strangers like you're cold calling someone. Feel free to reply or shoot me a DM. It would be cool to meet up at a Cars and Coffee or just talk cars.

A little bit about me:

I‚Äôm in my mid-20s, based in Central NJ (Middlesex/Union County), and I work up in North Jersey. I'm pretty laid back. I like checking out new food spots, doing some sightseeing, and I‚Äôm always looking for cool places to take photos of my car. I‚Äôve been getting into photography lately too, so if you‚Äôve got any tips, definitely let me know. I'm a big TV/movie person and always looking for something new to binge.

Thanks! PFA

1nag69r,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nag69r,"To be fair, you asked‚Ä¶","‚Ä¶so I smoked a Padr√≥n Family Reserve, the #96 in Maduro. The quick take - if you just want to look at the photos and know what I think - is that, except for the Black being a stronger cigar, I feel like it‚Äôs pretty much a draw. I know that‚Äôs probably not what you want to hear, but I would honestly take either one on any given day.

The longer take - this was a ~$33 cigar, so, not cheap either. At 5.75x52, it‚Äôs smaller than the Black (6.75x54). Had the same amount of tobacco been used in both cigars, I feel they would have been very comparable in price. 

A sweet barnyard nose and hazelnut cold draw gave way to sweet and peppery flavors on the initial light. This cigar smelled great; I sat it down after lighting to go check on some habaneros I am growing and I could smell the awesomeness fifty feet away. Another puff revealed a very woody mouth taste that kept chugging along until‚Ä¶the flavor changed to almost the *exact same flavor* the Black showed. Big. Black. Coffee. 

I mean, dominant. For me, spectacular! It‚Äôs flavors like this that make me understand why I don‚Äôt smoke mostly CC. I want a bold cigar, and while this wasn‚Äôt as full strength as the Black was/is, it *was* boldly flavorful. As such, I‚Äôd still take the Black over this cigar u/SuspiciousRice24. I like and want the stronger smoke.

 My perception - given the local to me shops that I‚Äôve been in - is that this cigar is more widely available than the Black. If this is in the store and you‚Äôre there to buy a $22 LP, go ahead and spend the extra $10 and get a better cigar. I have nothing against LPs (I *really* like most of them), but they just aren‚Äôt Padr√≥ns. üôÇ",12,1757207379.0,cigar_refuge,3,0.84,False
