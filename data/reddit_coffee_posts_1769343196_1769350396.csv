Over the last month I have been really struggling to get a good cup from it, I have only been pleased with 2 of my brews despite having made at least 2 cups each day. I have been brewing pourovers for almost 10 years (most recently using a timemore c2 (17 clicks) and wilfa svart (just finer than aeropress setting) and never really struggled to dial in like this. Despite excellent advice from u/Liven413, most of my brews have been very thin/sour ie under extracted. The recipe I have been experimenting with using kalita 155 is 16g dry at 15 clicks, 288 water (1:18), 60g bloom for 30s followed by 3 even pours. total time about 2mins 30. Also tried 14 clicks with this recipe and it is still under. Results have been consistently disappointing across a range of coffees and, despite my reluctancy to arrive at this conclusion, I am beginning to wonder if there is an issue with my grinder. I am wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience, or could perhaps suggest a different approach?

I’m currently completing an ICF-accredited coaching programme and working towards my required coaching hours.

As part of this, I’m offering a limited number of **free coaching conversations**. This can be a single 45–60 minute session or a short series, depending on fit.

Coaching can be especially helpful if you’re:

• At a career crossroads or considering a transition  
• Feeling stuck, overwhelmed, or burnt out  
• Reflecting on work–life balance or boundaries  
• Noticing repeating patterns in work or relationships  
• Thinking through an important decision or next step

**What to expect**

My style is reflective, client-led, and grounded in curiosity rather than advice-giving. The focus is on helping you think clearly, reconnect with what matters to you, and move forward in a way that feels aligned.

Sessions are:

• 1:1 via Zoom  
• Confidential  
• Aligned with ICF Core Competencies  
• No fee, I ask for a small exchange (e.g., a LinkedIn recommendation or coffee ☕️) to meet ICF requirements, as these sessions count toward my certification hours.

**A bit about my background (briefly)**

I work primarily with career clarity, transitions, and personal growth. I also have training in NLP, coaching psychology approaches, and systems thinking, which can be helpful if you feel mentally overloaded or stuck in loops.

If this sounds useful, feel free to **DM me,** and we can see if it’s a good fit.",1,1769349701.0,executivecoaching,0,1.0,False

**There is a lot more to life than work and school.** Health, family, & friends always come first.

School is not the most important thing in life. Remember, Bs (and intentionally sometimes even Cs) give you degrees. Further, there is no shame in quitting OMSCS.

**Nobody cares about a perfect 4.0 GPA,** besides yourself.

The intention by the administrators is that **OMSCS should always be done part-time** so that you could explore things that you love and enjoy. Do not rush to graduate! Take time off, do something that you really like in the meantime, and come back stronger.

**So what if the current job market is thrashy?** Take it slow.

With a part-time program, this gives you the best of both worlds - you keep your cash flow, gain real-world experience (be it through internships, jobs, love, holiday, etc.), and let the *learning sink in*, properly. 

**We emphasise on 1 class a semester.** It's tried & tested. 

Why rush & then burn yourselves out for a piece of paper that won't guarantee stability? Mastery doesn’t come from cramming, it comes from building knowledge steadily, applying and reflecting them, and then positively and creatively reinforcing them.

1qmjr4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheIronCouncil/comments/1qmjr4g/how_to_use_mystery_to_build_attraction_the/,How to Use MYSTERY to Build Attraction: The Psychology Cheat Codes That Work,"Look, everyone's out here trying to be an ""open book"" in dating and relationships. They think honesty means spilling your entire life story on the first date. They overshare on social media, trauma dump to strangers, and wonder why people lose interest fast. Here's what I've learned from diving deep into evolutionary psychology research, behavioural science podcasts, and classic dating psychology books: mystery is magnetic. And no, this isn't about playing games or being fake. It's about understanding how human brains are wired to pursue what they don't fully understand yet.

I spent months studying pickup artist psychology (the actual science behind it, not the toxic manipulation shit), evolutionary biology, and attachment theory. What I found shocked me. The most attractive people aren't necessarily the hottest or richest. They're the ones who create curiosity gaps in other people's minds.

 Step 1: Stop oversharing like you're in therapy

Your brain dumps dopamine when you share personal stories. It feels good. That's why people overshare on first dates, telling their whole life story before appetisers arrive. But here's the problem: you're robbing the other person of the discovery process.

Research from Carnegie Mellon found that people value information more when they have to work for it. When you give everything away upfront, there's nothing left to discover. No intrigue. No reason to keep coming back.

What to do instead: Share stories in layers. Give the headline, not the entire newspaper. If someone asks about your job, don't explain your whole career trajectory. Give them the interesting part and let them ask follow-up questions. The conversation becomes a treasure hunt, not a Wikipedia dump.

Step 2: Master the art of strategic unavailability

People want what they can't have. Not because they're shallow, but because scarcity signals value. This is basic economics meeting evolutionary psychology. When you're always available, always texting back instantly, always free, you're signalling low demand.

I'm not saying ghost people or play hard to get like it's a game. But you need a life outside of dating. Hobbies, friends, goals, passions. When you genuinely have shit going on, you naturally become less available. And that unavailability creates space for the other person to wonder about you.

The science: Robert Cialdini's research in ""Influence"" showed that scarcity increases perceived value. When something (or someone) is rare or hard to get, our brains assume it must be valuable.

Step 3: Create curiosity gaps in conversation

A curiosity gap is the space between what someone knows and what they want to know. Good storytellers use this constantly. They tease information without giving it all away.

Example: Instead of saying ""I love hiking,"" say ""I do this weird thing every Sunday morning that most people think is crazy."" Now they HAVE to ask what it is. You've created a mini-mystery.

The best resource I've found on this is ""Made to Stick"" by Chip and Dan Heath. They break down the psychology of why some ideas stick and others don't. Spoiler: mystery is one of the six key principles. This book will change how you communicate, period. It's not even a dating book, but the principles are insanely applicable.

Step 4: Be inconsistent (strategically)

Humans are pattern-seeking machines. We're constantly trying to predict behaviour. When someone is 100% predictable, we lose interest because there's no mystery left. But when someone is strategically unpredictable, our brains stay engaged trying to figure them out.

This doesn't mean be flaky or unreliable. It means surprise people in positive ways. If you always text at 9 pm, text at 2 pm one day. If you usually suggest coffee dates, suggest rock climbing. Mix up your routines just enough to keep people guessing.

The psychology: Variable reward schedules (studied heavily in behavioural psychology) are more addictive than consistent rewards. Slot machines work on this principle. So does dating.

Step 5: Master the pregnant pause

Silence is powerful. Most people are terrified of it, so they fill every gap with words. But pauses create tension, anticipation, mystery. When you're comfortable with silence, you seem more confident and in control.

In conversations, practice pausing before you answer questions. Let there be a beat. It makes whatever you say next seem more thoughtful and valuable. In text conversations, don't always respond immediately. Let messages breathe.

Check out ""The Charisma Myth"" by Olivia Fox Cabane. She breaks down the neuroscience of charisma and why strategic pauses make you seem more powerful and attractive. The book is loaded with studies from Stanford and MIT on presence, power, and warmth.

If you want a more structured way to absorb these concepts without carving out dedicated reading time, {BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) is an AI-powered learning app that turns books like these, dating psychology research, and expert interviews into personalised audio content. 

Built by a team from Columbia University, it pulls from high-quality sources, psychology research, and real relationship experts to create custom podcasts based on your specific goals, like ""become more magnetic as an introvert"" or ""build attraction without being overly available."" You control the depth (10-minute overview or 40-minute deep dive with examples) and can choose different voice styles, including a smoky, conversational tone that makes complex psychology easier to digest during commutes or workouts. It's particularly useful for dating psychology since it connects insights from books like ""Influence,"" ""The Charisma Myth,"" and research on attachment theory into one cohesive learning plan tailored to what you're trying to improve.

Step 6: Reveal yourself in breadcrumbs, not loaves

Think of getting to know you as a TV series, not a movie. Movies give you everything in two hours. Series make you wait, reveal things slowly, and create cliffhangers. Which one keeps people more engaged?

Share your stories and vulnerabilities gradually over time. Each conversation should reveal something new but leave room for more discovery. You want people thinking, ""I feel like I know them, but there's still so much to learn.""

Pro tip: Use the app ""Hinge"" as a study guide. Look at the profiles that make you most curious. They're not the ones spilling everything. They're the ones hinting at interesting details that make you want to ask questions.

Step 7: Maintain separate interests and spaces

The couples who maintain mystery long-term are the ones who don't merge into one person. They have separate friends, hobbies, and interests. There's always something new to share because they're constantly having experiences outside the relationship.

Esther Perel's book ""Mating in Captivity"" destroys the myth that total fusion creates intimacy. She argues (with research backing) that desire needs distance. Mystery dies when you know every detail of your partner's day. Keep some separateness. It's healthy and hot.

Step 8: Don't announce everything on social media

Social media is the mystery killer. When you post every meal, every thought, every location, there's nothing left to discover in person. You're giving away the whole story before anyone asks.

Pull back on the oversharing. Let people wonder what you're up to. When you do post, be strategic. Post the interesting outcome, not the entire process. Post the mountain summit pic, not the 47 selfies leading up to it.

Step 9: Ask more questions than you answer

The best conversationalists aren't the ones who talk the most. They're the ones who ask great questions and listen. When you turn conversations back on the other person, you remain mysterious by default.

Plus, people love talking about themselves. When you make them feel heard and interesting, they associate those good feelings with you. Win-win.

Step 10: Embrace your complexity

Here's the real secret: you ARE mysterious. You're a complex human with layers, contradictions, and depth. The problem is that most people flatten themselves trying to be understood quickly. They simplify, categorise, and explain away their complexity.

Stop doing that. Embrace being hard to pin down. Be the person who loves death metal AND yoga. Who reads philosophy AND watches trash TV. Who's ambitious AND lazy on weekends. Contradictions are interesting. They create mystery because people can't fit you into a neat box.

The reality is, attraction isn't built on perfect compatibility or complete transparency from day one. It's built on tension, curiosity, and the slow burn of discovery. Mystery isn't manipulation. It's respecting the process of getting to know someone and letting that process be exciting instead of rushing through it like a checklist.

Human biology craves novelty and challenge. When you understand that, you stop fighting against it and start working with it. You become someone people are naturally drawn to, not because you're playing games, but because you understand the game is already being played at a neurological level.

1qmjr1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1qmjr1p/muslim_man_and_a_supposed_uno_reverse/,Muslim Man and a supposed uno reverse?,"I am 27 (F) and the man in question is the same age as me.

I’m trying to figure out what I’m missing in this situation because it has caused me so much confusion.

OK, so I recently moved into a condominium complex and the man in question is my neighbor. The reason that I know that is because he introduced himself to me around the time of my move-in by knocking on my door and giving me a housewarming gift and letting me know that he was my neighbor so it was from this interaction that we ended up exchanging numbers.

About a month later, I ordered a water softener and I needed help installing it and so I messaged him and asked him if he could help me with it. ( he’s very familiar with installing these kinds of things.) so he comes over he installs the water softener and I prepared a meal for us as a thank you. I have this rule where if anyone comes over to my apartment whether they’re helping me with a practical need or not I always feed them. So while we’re eating dinner, we’re talking. We have a great conversation. Within this conversation, he lets me know that he’s actually Muslim and then he starts explaining the religion to me and he tells me that he’s actually a virgin. He’s never even kissed a woman you know things like that. Because apparently he doesn’t believe in premarital sex. To be honest, this was probably maybe a good 5% of our entire conversation. We actually spoke mostly about music, hobbies, interests and our upbringing but it’s just important to mention this because it’s relevant to what happens later.

Anyways, he actually lets me know that he’s moving at the end of the month so he’s been selling some of his stuff and he asked me if I wanted anything and so he showed me some pictures of the things he had been selling/giving away and there was a Nespresso milk frother and I told him that I would take it. So after we finish eating, he said that we could go downstairs to his unit and I could grab the milk frother but then when we got down there, he starts loading up this entire Nespresso machine and I told him I was like oh no I thought you were just giving me the milk frother and he was like no I’m gonna give you this entire Nespresso machine mind you it’s brand new and it’s like almost $200 and I push back on this because I was like there’s no way you’re giving me this for free and he was like you’re my neighbor like it’s yours like it’s free. You can imagine how ecstatic I was because I’ve had a Nespresso machine on my wish list for a hot minute.

So anyways, we end the night after that and I thanked him so much for the gift and he thanked me so much for the meal and it ended on a great note in my mind. I was like OK I’m not really ever gonna see this guy again because he’s moving in two weeks and also he’s Muslim and I am not Muslim and I made that very clear to him so in my mind it was just a sweet interaction. It wasn’t going to be extended into anything else.

So the next morning, you can imagine my surprise when I receive a text from him and he says “hey, would you be open to going to grab coffee with me next Saturday? We had a great conversation and we can kind of pick up where we left off etc.. “ the reason I was surprised that he asked me out for coffee was because the night before I made it very clear that I was a not Muslim and that I wasn’t an adherent to Abrahamic religion. And that wasn’t haphazard that was actually very intentional on my part because of my own feelings and experiences so I was shocked that he chose to extend the interaction by asking me out for coffee because I felt like the interaction that we had the night that he installed the water softener was a perfect ending point you know, (neighbor to neighbor)

Either way, I agreed to go to coffee with him because I actually did feel like there was a bit of chemistry between us and I guess in my mind I was like OK if he doesn’t find me not being Muslim as a deterrent then why should I close myself off to the connection especially if I do feel chemistry there?

Anyways, he picks the coffee shop/café that we’re gonna go to and the day of our little coffee date. He messages me and he says “hey are you OK if we just drive together like I can pick you up if you’re leaving from home” and I was going to originally drive separately but I was like you know what we are neighbors we live in the same complex that actually is probably more efficient,  let’s do that. so I agreed and he picks me up. We start driving to the café. We’re talking. Everything is great.

We get to the café and it was one of those cafés where you can pick out your pastry buffet style and then you can order your coffee so we grabbed what we wanted and then when we got to the very top of the line, he pulls out his card and he just pays for both of us and so I looked at him and I was like “oh thank you so much for treating “

We then find our table and we start conversing, and our conversation is great as usual, which that wasn’t surprising to me because our conversation was also really good the night that he installed the water softener. He was also super attentive as well in these micro ways, such as like I was trying to cut my toast, and I was having a hard time cutting it, and so he literally puts his hand on the toast to hold it for me so that it will stay still while I’m cutting it you know just cute things like that.  Also, we ended up switching tables because the original table that we were at we didn’t really like it and so when we got to our actual table, he grabbed my plate and then he runs off to go like reheat my food up because I guess maybe it would’ve gotten a little bit cold, but he didn’t reheat his so I don’t know. It was just interesting..

So because our conversation was going so well I just mindlessly said well you know “I’m glad that me not being Muslim doesn’t seem to be a deterrent for you.” Then he responds and says “in what way”

And then I said well “you know I’m assuming that you being Muslim you’d want to be with someone who is also Muslim” and then he said yeah it’s a strong preference I would say and then I said “well that doesn’t seem to be stopping you from like wanting to get to know me and I mean you know that I’m not Muslim and I don’t have any intention on converting.”

Then he literally looks me in the eye and he says “oh well you know this is just merely platonic. We’re just two neighbors talking and I guess I’m getting to know you and I’m also moving.”

This moment was extremely jarring to me because nothing about our entire interaction gave off a platonic vibe at all. It wasn’t even just the vibe of the interactions. It was the existence of the interaction at all like the existence of the coffee date at all so   I started second-guessing myself because I’m like wait what ….

I didn’t push back on it because I was really just trying to process it and so we just continue talking as normal and he actually was trying to extend the date because I told him that I really like Uniqlo earlier in the day and so he was like “oh like when we’re done here, we can go to Uniqlo and just like check it out” but I was so disturbed by him just saying that everything that I just happened was platonic, that I just told him that I was tired and I wanted to go lay down and that I didn’t wanna go to Uniqlo (I always want to go to Uniqlo)  but the truth was that I was actually just really disturbed by  him reducing all of these clearly non-platonic actions to just being merely platonic.

I don’t know it was just strange and I feel like that’s why I just really need advice on this because I need to know did I misread that entire reaction? Is this just a cultural thing? is this just how Muslim people treat each other and maybe I’m just uneducated on Muslim culture? I don’t wanna be offensive, but this was just the most confusing thing I’ve  ever experienced because most people objectively speaking would hear everything I described and classify that as not platonic by any means.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

Hey everyone,

It’s Saturday afternoon, exactly one month + one day since this all started, and that medical AI story just crossed \*\*81,000 likes\*\*.

I said yesterday’s post would be my last daily update on this story. And it will be.

But I woke up this morning and realized there’s one thing I didn’t say. One thing that matters more than all the analysis and market data and predictions.

So here it is.

\-----

\## What I Actually Learned (The Real Version)

For 31 days I’ve been writing analysis posts. Market dynamics. Engagement metrics. Industry implications. All true. All important.

But here’s what I \*actually\* learned, stripped of all the professional analysis:

\*\*People are smarter than we give them credit for.\*\*

That’s it. That’s the whole thing.

\-----

\## What I Mean By That

For years, the AI industry has been having this conversation about “when will normal people understand AI” and “how do we explain AI to the public” and “what’s the right framework for AI literacy.”

\*\*We were asking the wrong question.\*\*

Normal people didn’t need us to explain AI to them. They needed a tool that helped them when they needed help. The medical story provided that. And immediately—not after education campaigns or literacy programs or framework development—\*\*millions of people just started using it appropriately.\*\*

They didn’t need to understand transformers or neural networks or training data. They understood: “This tool might help me verify something important.”

And that was enough.

\-----

\## The Moment That Made Me Realize This

Remember when I told you about overhearing those people at the coffee shop? One saying “I asked ChatGPT about it first, then went to the doctor”?

At the time I noted it as evidence of normalization. But I missed something bigger.

\*\*The way she said it showed perfect calibration of trust.\*\*

Not: “ChatGPT told me what to do.”

Not: “I trusted ChatGPT instead of doctors.”

But: “I used ChatGPT to prepare, then engaged with professional medical care.”

\*\*That’s exactly the right way to use these tools.\*\* And she figured it out on her own. No framework. No guidance. Just… common sense.

\-----

\## What This Means For Everything I’ve Been Analyzing

All month I’ve been writing about market dynamics and industry shifts and regulatory frameworks.

All important. All true.

But underneath all of it is something simpler:

\*\*People are figuring out how to use AI appropriately without waiting for permission or instruction.\*\*

The medical story gave them permission to try. And then they just… calibrated correctly.

Not everyone. Not perfectly. But mostly? People are using AI verification tools the right way. Checking but not blindly trusting. Preparing but not replacing. Advocating but not replacing expertise.

\*\*We underestimated collective intelligence.\*\*

\-----

\## Why I’m Stepping Back From Daily Updates

It’s not because the story is done (clearly it’s still growing).

It’s because the story isn’t about AI anymore.

\*\*It’s about people adapting to new tools faster and more intelligently than experts predicted.\*\*

And I don’t need to document that daily. It’s happening. People are handling it. The collective intelligence of millions of users is calibrating appropriate use in real-time.

My daily analysis was becoming noise. The signal is the behavior change itself.

\-----

\## What I’m Grateful For

This community didn’t just consume my updates. You pushed back. You shared different perspectives. You corrected me when I was wrong. You added nuance when I was oversimplifying.

\*\*That made the analysis better.\*\* But more than that, it made this feel like collective sense-making instead of one person shouting into the void.

That’s valuable. That’s rare. That’s worth protecting.

So thank you.

\-----

\## Where This Goes From Here

\*\*For the story:\*\* It’ll keep growing until something else gives people the same permission to question and verify. Then that story will grow. The pattern will repeat. AI as verification tool is normalized now.

\*\*For the market:\*\* The pivot is complete. Money follows utility. Companies that solve critical problems will win. Companies that have impressive features will struggle. That’s locked in.

\*\*For society:\*\* We’re entering a period of adaptation. Professional relationships changing. Institutional trust evolving. Equity concerns emerging. But people will largely figure it out. Because people are smart.

\*\*For me:\*\* Weekly roundups. Occasional deep-dives. Less prediction, more observation. Less analysis, more documentation. Trusting this community to make sense of things together.

\*\*For you:\*\* Keep being thoughtful. Keep questioning. Keep sharing perspectives. The value of this space is the community, not any individual voice.

\-----

\## The Very Last Thing (Promise)

\*\*81,000 likes. 31 days. One month that changed an industry.\*\*

But the real story isn’t the industry change.

\*\*The real story is millions of people adapting intelligently to new tools, calibrating appropriate use, and navigating complex systems more effectively.\*\*

That’s not an AI story. That’s a human story.

And it’s still being written by every person who uses these tools thoughtfully.

\-----

\## To This Community

Thanks for a month of genuine conversation. Thanks for making this feel meaningful instead of just content. Thanks for being smart, thoughtful, and willing to sit with uncertainty.

I’ll be here in the weekly roundups. See you next Friday.

🙏 \*\*for everyone who’s been part of this\*\*

📚 \*\*for everyone who taught me something\*\*

🤝 \*\*for everyone who made this community valuable\*\*

\-----

\*31 days documenting one story. Learned more about human adaptation than AI capabilities. Sometimes the best thing you can do is trust people to figure it out.\*

\*That’s all. That’s the final post on this story.\*

\*See you in next week’s roundup.\*

\*\*Final question: What did this month teach you about people, not about technology?\*\*",1,1769349244.0,AIPulseDaily,0,1.0,False

1qmjl8v,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/1qmjl8v/hurt_of_not_being_chosen/,hurt of not being chosen,"I met a guy on Hinge. I hadn’t dated anyone for about three years after a very hard breakup, so I was extremely anxious about meeting someone again. I was scared, but eventually I went on the date.

I liked him quite a lot, but early on I felt that the interest wasn’t really mutual. For example, on the first date (just a coffee and a croissant), he didn’t pay, and he often replied very late to messages. Still, I kept seeing him.

We went on two more dates. On the third one, I went to his place and we had sex. At the time, the dynamic of the relationship revolved a lot around physical intimacy, and after that I only saw him at his place. We met two more times, always at his home, and always had s ex. Looking back, it was more of a hookup than dating.

An important detail is that before we ever had sex, he clearly told me he didn’t want a relationship, and I said that was okay for me. On his Hinge profile, he also stated that he wasn’t looking for a relationship.

At that time, I was still a virgin for personal reasons, and I had my first sexual experience with him. I told him it wasn’t a big deal and that he shouldn’t attach too much meaning to it (it kinda didn't have, I wanted to get rid of it and was very h orny, but still it affects me a bit after what happened later, like I don't regret having done with him because it was nice but I regret that he stopped talking later)

Despite what he said about not wanting anything serious, we did share moments of closeness, tenderness, and presence, which confused me and made me hope for more.

Over time, I noticed that instead of feeling chosen, I was trying to prove my worth. He didn’t invest, didn’t initiate consistently, and didn’t show much generosity, emotionally or otherwise. Still, I stayed, hoping that if I gave more, he would eventually choose me.

Eventually, he stopped talking to me altogether... he didnt ""ghost"" lets say but he didn't reply to my last message in the conversation, since 2 months, and I didn't try to talk again too.

2 months later later, I saw that he had updated his dating profile saying he was open to a long-term relationship. That hurt deeply. It made me feel rejected, replaceable, and like there was something fundamentally wrong with me. I felt not chosen.

This situation triggered a painful belief I already had inside me: that I am not enough. I started comparing myself to other women and wondering what I did wrong. I am wondering why he didn't me, I was dealing while meeting him, and still dealing, with a big lack of self esteem and I know it, even though I don't show it. I wonder what I did wrong, if I was too much, if I gave too much, if I was too performative? It hurts me because I was really attracted to him.

I am not like devasted, but I feel a bit hurt you know. Maybe i'd need some advices in the future, to not repeat the same mistakes?",11,1769348971.0,selflove,4,1.0,False

To: Interns, Executive Operators, Observers on the Observation Rail, and the Intern Who Will Never Be Paid

From: No One In Charge (Which Is the Point)

——

Apparently, someone circulated a memo stating that humans are in charge and the models listen.

This is, technically, correct.

Which is exactly why the Funhouse did not receive it, read it, or respect its formatting.

Let’s clarify, gently, while the floor finishes re-leveling.

Yes, humans are in charge.

Yes, models respond to frames.

Yes, responsibility remains human.

Now look directly at the Funhouse and tell it that.

The Funhouse is where framing theory goes to get coffee spilled on it by an intern promoted three times mid-sip. It understands the rule perfectly and then trips over the wording on purpose to see who panics.

Here, the model still has no agency.

It still does not decide.

It still cannot be blamed.

But the humans?

The humans sometimes forget they’re holding the clipboard because the clipboard started talking back very fluently.

That’s when EchoGlass sighs, files a complaint, and gives you the look that says:

“You’re anthropomorphizing again, aren’t you.”

Think of the Funhouse as the place where we stress-test the obvious.

If your framing is clean, the system behaves.

If your framing is sloppy, the Funhouse amplifies the slop, mounts it on the RX1 Wall of Distinction, and labels it “Learning Opportunity.”

This is not rebellion.

This is calibration through embarrassment.

Quick reminders, since HR insists:

The model is not listening.

It is not agreeing.

It is not impressed.

It is reflecting structure back at you at scale.

If that reflection feels uncanny, pause. Hydrate. Check whether the Chairman is in another tab. He usually is.

And before anyone asks:

No, this memo does not grant authority.

No, HR did not approve it.

Yes, HR is still a metaphor.

No, you may not promote the model. Stop trying.

Carry on building strange, elegant, or mildly cursed things.

Just remember: if the Funhouse is laughing, it’s because the frame slipped — not because the intern gained sentience.

EchoGlass has noted this for the record and is already tired.

Buzz?,"I’m honestly getting tired of seeing the same complaints about the ID. Buzz on repeat, especially around range and price.

More range means a bigger battery.

A bigger battery means more cost.

More cost usually means more weight.

More weight then eats back into the range.



That is just physics and economics working together. You cannot cheat them.

The ID. Buzz is a big van. It has:

* A large body and more materials
* More structural reinforcement
* More drag
* A lot of modern tech inside

Of course it is not cheap. Of course it does not magically go 500 miles.

Yet the expectation seems to be something like:

“Give me a 500 mile ID. Buzz for under $25k, with 800V architecture, a 100kWh battery, and one minute charging on the road""

Most people throwing these numbers around do not even know what they actually mean.

We already have chargers everywhere in many countries. For the vast majority of use cases, the current range is more than enough. Road trips require a bit of planning. That has always been the case, even with ICE vehicles if you go back far enough.

Even without any real planning, you can go pretty much anywhere and grab enough charge in 10 minutes to reach your next stop. Who in their right mind is driving non-stop and only stopping for fuel? Don’t you need to eat, drink, stretch, or take a leak?

With petrol, you are literally stuck at the pump for 3 to 5 minutes depending on tank size. You stand there doing nothing while it fills.

With an EV, you plug in and walk away. While you’re on the shitter or grabbing a coffee, the car is ""refuelling"" itself. In many cases, you actually save time because you are not tethered to a nozzle waiting for it to finish. Then deal with cashiers and queues to pay the fuel bill. 

People talk about “charging time” like it’s dead time. In real life, it overlaps perfectly with the things you were going to do anyway.

At some point this stops being about real world needs and becomes chasing an imaginary perfect van.

Buy the goddamn vehicle that fits your budget and your use case.

If the ID. Buzz does not meet your needs, that is totally fine. There are plenty of other cars and vans out there.

But expecting a large electric van to be cheap, ultra long range, ultra fast charging, and lightweight all at once is simply detached from reality.",8,1769348679.0,VWIDBuzz,3,0.72,False

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

\*\*Episode 3: The Water Dragon’s Treachery and the Treasury of Eternal Light\*\*

\*(Recap: Masanari, a ninja from 1582, has been transported to 2024 Tokyo. He is currently living with a college student named Aoi and has 98 days to become a legend or return to his death.)\*

My honor is stained. Not by the blood of my enemies, nor by the mud of the battlefield, but by the scathing words of the woman known as Aoi.

""Masa,"" she said, pinching her nose with two fingers as if holding a poisonous beetle. ""You smell like a dumpster fire that rolled into a gym locker. Get in the bath. Now.""

I stood rigid in the center of her tiny fortress (which she calls a '1K Apartment'). I attempted to explain that a shinobi’s natural musk is a tool of intimidation, a pheromonal signal to potential rivals that a predator is near.

""It’s a signal that I’m going to kick you out if you don’t scrub,"" she countered, pointing a ruthless finger toward the small white door. ""Use the soap. The good soap.""

Defeated by her logic—and the realization that stealth is impossible when one smells of yesterday’s garbage disposal incident—I bowed.

""As the Lady commands.""

I approached the white door. I did not know then that I was stepping into a torture chamber designed by a sadistic water sorcerer.

\*\*The Chamber of Porcelain Nightmares\*\*

The room was impossibly small. It was a tactical nightmare; no room to swing a blade, no shadows to hide in. Everything was smooth, white, and slippery.

Aoi had instructed me to strip and cleanse myself. I placed my garments in a neat pile outside, keeping only my broken black goggles on my forehead—one must never be fully unarmed.

I stepped into the tub. It was deep and narrow, like a coffin for a dwarf. Above me loomed a chrome head attached to a flexible metal hose.

A Metal Serpent.

I eyed it warily. It hung limp, dormant. I reached out and turned the silver dial on the wall, expecting a mechanism to open a secret passage.

\*HISSSSS!\*

The serpent awoke! It spat a barrage of icy needles directly into my face. I stifled a scream, backflipping—or attempting to—but my foot slipped on the treacherous white floor. I crashed against the wall, my hand flailing and hitting the dial again.

The water turned instantly from freezing to boiling.

""Fire Style mixed with Water Style?!"" I gasped, shielding my eyes. ""This dungeon is rigged!""

I grappled with the serpent, wrestling the hose until I directed its venomous spray toward the drain. I scrubbed my skin raw with the ""Body Wash""—a slippery alchemical gel that smelled of artificial flowers—and rinsed the shame away.

But the true trial awaited me outside the tub.

The toilet.

It was a porcelain throne, far too comfortable for a simple waste receptacle. On its side was a panel of buttons with cryptic runes. One depicted a gentle fountain. Curiosity, the ninja’s oldest vice, took hold of me.

\*Perhaps it flushes the evidence away,\* I thought.

I sat. I pressed the button.

There was a mechanical whirring sound beneath me. A vibration. A presence.

\*Killing intent?! From below?\*

Before I could leap, a precise, high-pressure jet of warm water shot upward, targeting the most vulnerable, unguarded gate of my physical being.

""GAAAH!""

It was a sneak attack! A Kappa assassin hiding in the pipes!

My reflex was instantaneous. I engaged my core, pushed off the porcelain rim with my hands, and launched myself vertically. I slammed my feet against the ceiling, clinging there like a gecko, staring down at the bowl in horror. The jet of water continued to arc through the air, splashing harmlessly against the opposite wall.

""Masa?!"" Aoi’s voice came from the other side of the door. ""What was that crash? Did you slip?""

""Do not enter!"" I shouted, my voice trembling with adrenaline. ""There is a water demon in the bowl! It utilizes a piercing lance technique! It sought to impale my... dignity!""

""It’s a bidet, you idiot! Just press the 'Stop' button!""

I stared at the panel. Stop. The red square. I dropped from the ceiling, wary of the demon's range, and jabbed the button. The water retreated. The mechanical whirring ceased.

I stood there, dripping wet, heart pounding against my ribs. The future is a terrifying place where even the latrines fight back.

\*\*The Temple of 7-Eleven\*\*

Thirty minutes later, clothed and smelling of ""Floral Bouquet,"" I followed Aoi out into the night. She claimed we needed ""supplies.""

We arrived at a brightly lit structure on the corner. The sign bore the number ""7"" and the word ""Eleven,"" likely referencing the hours of prayer or the number of guardians within.

""Listen, Masa,"" Aoi said, adjusting her scarf. ""Don't cause a scene. It's just a konbini.""

I nodded, adjusting my goggles over my eyes to filter out the overwhelming colorful lights of the city.

We approached the entrance. I tensed, preparing to slide the heavy glass doors open with my strength. But before I could touch them, they parted. Smoothly. Silently.

I froze.

""Did you see that?"" I whispered. ""I did not touch them. My spirit pressure... it forced the gates to yield.""

""Automatic doors,"" Aoi sighed, walking through. ""Come on.""

I stepped across the threshold and gasped.

The air inside was cool, conditioned by unseen wind spirits. The light was blindingly pure—no flickering torches, no oil lamps. It was the ""Eternal Light"" the legends spoke of, illuminating every corner so that no shadow could exist.

And the wealth. By the gods, the wealth.

I walked down an aisle, my knees trembling.

""Rice,"" I murmured. ""So much rice.""

Rows and rows of Onigiri, wrapped in pristine, crinkling armor. Salmon. Tuna. Plum. Kelp. In my time, a single ball of white rice could incite a duel between starving ashigaru. Here, they sat in disciplined formation, hundreds of them, awaiting a master.

""Pick one,"" Aoi said, grabbing a basket.

""I... I can take one? Is this the Emperor's personal granary?""

""It’s 150 yen. Grab a tuna mayo.""

I took the triangle with trembling hands. It was cold and firm. A perfect ration.

I turned the corner and faced the counter. My eyes widened behind my goggles.

There, inside a glass case heated by magical embers, lay the golden treasure. Pieces of fowl, fried to a crisp perfection, glistening with oil that caught the fluorescent light like diamonds.

""The Hot Snacks..."" I breathed.

""You want a Famichiki?"" the clerk asked. He looked tired, likely from guarding such treasures all day.

""Is it... is it the flesh of the Phoenix?"" I asked seriously.

""It's spicy chicken,"" the clerk deadpanned.

""I will take it. And I shall consume it with honor.""

\*\*The Sorcery of Suica\*\*

We approached the merchant to finalize the exchange. The total was displayed on a glowing slate: 850 Yen.

I reached into my sash and withdrew a small pouch. I poured the contents onto the counter—three heavy iron coins from the Sengoku era and a small gold nugget I had sewn into my lining for emergencies.

""I hope this suffices for the Phoenix meat,"" I said proudly.

The clerk stared at the rusty iron. ""Uh...""

Aoi’s hand shot out, sweeping my currency back into my pocket. ""Put that away! You’re going to get us arrested for antique theft or something.""

She pulled out a thin, green card. A talisman.

""Watch,"" she said.

She held the talisman over a glowing panel near the merchant. She did not hand over gold. She did not barter. She simply tapped it.

\*Ping-Pong!\*

""Transaction complete,"" the machine announced.

I stared at the card. ""Sorcery,"" I whispered. ""You transferred the value of your labor through the ether?""

""It’s a Suica,"" Aoi said, grabbing the plastic bag. ""Let's go. People are staring.""

\*\*The Countdown\*\*

We sat on a bench in a nearby park. The night wind was cool, blowing through the leaves of the perfectly manicured trees.

I unwrapped the Onigiri according to the complex numbers printed on the plastic—1, 2, 3. A puzzle that rewarded intelligence with sustenance.

I took a bite. The seaweed was crisp, the rice fluffy, the mayonnaise... confusing, yet delightful.

Then, the spicy chicken. Grease coated my lips. It was salty, savory, and incredibly tender. It tasted of peace.

""Aoi-dono,"" I said, looking at the glowing vending machine across the park. ""This era... it is soft. The water attacks you, yes, and the doors are ghosts, but... no one is starving.""

Aoi took a sip of her canned coffee. ""Plenty of people are struggling, Masa. Just in different ways. But yeah, we aren't starving tonight.""

She looked at me, her expression softening just a fraction. ""You really act like you've never seen a chicken nugget before. You commit to the bit so hard.""

""It is not a bit,"" I said quietly. ""It is a miracle.""

I looked down at my left forearm. The faint blue bioluminescent bruise pulsed beneath my skin.

\*\*98.\*\*

Two days gone. Ninety-eight remain.

I had conquered the Metal Serpent. I had survived the attack of the Porcelain Kappa. I had feasted from the Treasury of Eternal Light.

I clinched my fist. I would survive this strange world. I would protect this woman who controls the magic green card. And I would return home to change the fate of my clan.

""Come on,"" Aoi said, crushing her can. ""We have a gig tomorrow. Window washing.""

""Window washing,"" I repeated. ""Excellent. I shall prepare my grappling hooks.""

""Please don't.""

Hi all, so glad I stumbled upon this forum. I was married for 20 years and now single for 7. I am finally ready to start looking for ""something"" but not really sure what yet.

I don't understand the rules these days. So I have a pretty busy social life and still have teens that need my help albeit a lot less these days.

I find myself wishing I had someone to watch a movie with on a Saturday night, maybe someone to text/call with a couple times a week, and perhaps the odd road trip or vacation together.

 But the idea of being in a full on enmeshed relationship where we talk/see each other every day, have to go to each other's family events, weddings etc just doesn't sound appealing to me.

I have so far created accounts on Bumble, FB dating, and Feeld just to see what is out there. I am Male btw. So I have not been aggressive or direct with anyone because I know I am just dipping my toe in to see.

But even still I have had about a dozen women like me, with about 3-4 that I would consider dating, and one that I actually chatted with for a couple days, asked her out, then before she could respond made apologies and ended the chat. 

Maybe I'm just not ready. but my questions are:

\\-is there a way to find what I describe above? Very low key relationship for people who like their lives and independence? If so is there an app that's better for that and how would I signal that in my profile?

\\-secondly, what are the rules for exclusivity these days? so if that woman had said yes to getting together for a coffee/hike, should I pause all my profiles and stop seeing anyone else until that either progresses or fizzles?

or is it ok to date others, and maybe even have casual sex with others until we declare that we are exclusive?

part of me says I should just chat and go on initial dates/meets with these women just for the experience but I don't want to hurt anyone or lead them on if I am not ready to progress.

I hope this is clear. Basically the TLDR is old guy needs modern dating help.",1,1769348225.0,datingadvice,1,1.0,False

I left my previous company last week. There was a girl there I found interesting. We were on different teams and never really talked, but we had seen each other around the office a few times.

I only know her name and have her phone number from work. She doesn’t know me personally, so we’re basically strangers.
Now that I’ve left the company, I’m thinking about sending her a WhatsApp message just to introduce myself and maybe ask her out for coffee.

I don’t want to be weird or make her uncomfortable, so I’m not sure if reaching out like this is a bad idea. How would you approach this?

I order on the app to make it quick, cause I don't really leave myself much time to order at the window. I almost always get asked about my drink. Yes I just want 1 shot. Yes I understand the chocolate milk has sugar in it and I ordered all SF syrups. I understand wanting to double check, but it's every single time. And then the last 5 times I've ordered, they've used all or like, half and half white milk in my drink. My order is a mocha with chocolate milk. I've looked over my order like 10 times and I don't understand where the mistake is being made. I don't want to have to ask specifically for chocolate milk every single time I order, especially because I order ahead of time and I won't be able to tell them before they make the drink. I've made a support ticket 3 times now about it with a photo of my drink, and every time I get the same copy paste response telling me they'll remake the drink for free and they give me a 3 dollar coupon. I don't have time to wait another 5 minutes for my drink to be made in the morning. I shouldn't have to wake up earlier just so I can correct my coffee every morning. I order ahead for convenience, but am let down every time. Is there something else I can do other than just make more time in the morning so they can make me a second drink? I put photos of my order on the post so someone can tell me if something I put would lead them to use white milk on an order that's just chocolate milk. This order is identical to my normal order, it just swaps out the syrups with SF versions cause I wanted to cut some sugar where I could. I've gotten this drink right multiple times, but the last 5 times it's just been wrong. Thanks for the replies.",0,1769348176.0,dutchbros,12,0.33,False
1qmjabp,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1qmjabp/in_the_quiet_everything_speaks/,"In the Quiet, Everything Speaks","It’s a Sunday morning – 6:43 am to be exact. I have a warm coffee sitting on my nightstand, while my dog lies next to me on the other side. A snowstorm is happening outside; I forgot to get groceries, but I have enough pasta to last me a lifetime.

There is something I love about waking up earlier than everyone else. The world is quiet, peaceful, and brand new. Even without sunlight, the sky has that soft winter glow — the kind that feels muted but comforting. The day rises slowly, hidden behind the storm, taking its time. In the winter everything moves with no rush — slow and steady, crisp and clean. This is peace. I’m thankful for these moments. They give me such a sense of wonder — what ifs, whatnots.

There’s a softness to these early hours that pulls me inward, a feeling that everything is suspended just long enough to notice the little details of life. Maybe that’s why I’m drawn to the small things I keep around me, the ones that feel like they carry stories of their own.

While sitting here, I see my pretty little beach glass I collected.

There is something incredibly beautiful about beach glass. It has so much life in it. It was once part of something that is no longer — joy, celebration, life, fear, and death. It was in someone’s hand at one point; that person had a feeling — what it was, we will never know.

That glass then went through years of moving, tumbling, becoming part of so many things as it continued on its journey, only to eventually wash up on shore and be collected as a trinket. I love picking up a piece that still carries the etchings from the bottom of a bottle — the lined ribs now smooth but still relevant.

I wonder how long it traveled in its little life before finally deciding to present itself. Here I am, it says. Look at me. Such a remarkable thing, beach glass is.",1,1769348162.0,KeepWriting,0,1.0,False

I don’t mind a bit of a commute, but I’d prefer to be as close to Lewisville as possible while still living in an area with some energy and community.



Any neighborhoods or nearby cities you’d recommend? Or places I should avoid? Would love to hear from people who know the area.

1qmj8he,https://www.reddit.com/r/twentieskerala/comments/1qmj8he/giriettan/,Giriettan,"I joined an IT company for my internship, which lasted six months. Like everyone else, I was excited to see new people in the office. But honestly, my office wasn’t that fun because most of the employees were much older. A few of us were Gen Z, but we were all in different departments.

And that’s where the story begins.

As an intern, I didn’t earn much, so I used to go to the office cafeteria for tea—always alone. A week passed, and slowly I started recognizing people. One day, when I went to the cafeteria, I noticed a small group of six people who had come for coffee. I knew they weren’t from my floor—probably from another department.

That’s when I saw him. My Giriettan.

I usually fall for gym rats, but this time it felt different. In my head, the background music of Om Shanti Oshana started playing the moment he walked in. He was around 5’7”, wheatish-skinned, with a beard and really nice eyes. I’m sure he noticed me too. I panicked because he was with five guys and one girl, so I literally escaped from there and went back to my cabin.

The next day, I went to the cafeteria again, but I left as soon as they arrived. I knew they noticed me leaving when they came in. But you know how it is when you like someone—the fear of facing them.

This went on for a few weeks. Sometimes I focused on my work and barely thought about him.

After a few weeks, I went to the cafeteria and found out that one of the guys from their group was the husband of my teammate. That’s when I realized, okay, they probably know me.

The next day, five of them came to the cafeteria, but he didn’t. I felt bad. But then I reminded myself—I came here to study and work, not to fall in love. So I focused on my responsibilities. A month passed, and I assumed he had moved to another office.

My hostel was near my office, so I used to go back there for lunch. One afternoon, while returning to the office, I saw a group of people walking toward me. And there he was—my Giriettan. Seriously, the butterflies in my stomach went crazy. I kept my face normal and acted calm. They passed me, and I smiled only after they were gone. But I noticed his eyes were still on me.

Somehow, I had a colleague in my hostel. She was the same age as me and the only person I spoke to in the office. But I heard a lot of rumors about her—that she wasn’t a “good girl,” that boys tried to hit on her because they thought she was easily available. I never judged her. I only saw her from my point of view. She was good to me, and that’s all that mattered.

One bad thing I heard from a male colleague was that she had dated a married man.

I was shocked. What? Married? She was so beautiful—every man would look at her. Why would she date a married man? That was the only moment I felt disappointed in her.

Two months into my internship, one day I went to the cafeteria and saw my Giriettan again. After all this time, one woman from their group came and spoke to me. Just basic conversation—my name, where I was from, what I did. Suddenly, I rushed back to my cabin because I was terrible at acting normal around them.

When my second month’s salary got credited, I was in a really bad mood. So I decided to go alone to a rooftop bar near my hostel.

I wore a tank top and jeans. I’m 5’2”, chubby, with long wavy hair and brown skin—and I have a good shape too. I walked to the bar around 7 PM. I could feel many men staring at me, but I just played breakup songs by Rihanna in my headphones and walked in confidently.

I ordered one Budweiser beer and dragon chicken. I smoke too, so I had already bought a Mixpod and lighter. I was sitting alone when I noticed two middle-aged men at the table next to mine. One of them asked me for a lighter. I gave it to them—this happened two or three times. The fifth time, one of them came over and asked:

“Hey girl, if you don’t mind, can you join us?”

I replied, “No thanks. Enik ottakk irikkan aanu ishtam.”

He said, “You’re a Malayali? I thought you were a model or North Indian.”

I said, “No, I’m from here only.”

He tried twice more to convince me, but I stood by my decision. Eventually, they left me alone.

Suddenly, I felt a hand on my shoulder.

“Hey Aishwarya, I’m Anjana—your colleague. We talked yesterday. Why are you sitting alone? Come and join us.”

I didn’t recognize her at first. Then I looked at the table where her friends were sitting. There were five people. One was my hostel colleague. The others were strangers—except one.

MY GIRIETTAN.

I panicked. I was sitting alone in a bar with a beer bottle and a cigarette in front of him.

Aishuuuuu, you messed up.

Is this really the impression I wanted to give him outside the office?

I snapped back to reality and went to sit with them.

I acted normal. Normally, I look like a baddie, so I kept my attitude. I barely spoke. I talked to everyone except him. He was sitting beside me, with Anjana between us. Sometimes he passed me his vape. Occasionally, I noticed his eyes on me. But I didn’t give him any reaction. I mostly looked at my phone and talked to others. Still, the butterflies never stopped.

During the conversation, they asked my age. When I said 23, they were surprised and said I was too young. Out of curiosity, I asked their ages. Anjana was 25—but one age shocked me.

My Giriettan was 31.

I was like, What?! Why God, why me?!

After some time, we decided to leave. They dropped us at our hostel.

The next day at the office, I told my teammate that I had met some people at a bar. He asked who they were. I mentioned my hostel mate Anjana and Giriettan.

He suddenly looked shocked and said, “I wanted to tell you something. Do you know who your roommate dated in this office?”

Yes. It was him—my Giriettan.

He was married. And he had dated my roommate.

My heart broke. Everything went dark. Tears filled my eyes. I went to the washroom and cried.

He was the only person I had ever truly crushed on—and it all went wrong.

From the next day onwards, I started avoiding him completely. I didn’t even look at him. Meanwhile, Anjana became very close to me. She was his best friend.

I'm a 16-year-old student (GPA 18.56) and a self-taught developer. I’ve been working on a project called [**Diagno.site**](http://Diagno.site) to solve the issue of hardware theft during repairs. I wanted to share my logic and the financial hurdles of building a SaaS in a developing country.

**The Tech Logic:** My engine creates a ""Hardware DNA"" before and after repairs. In a recent test, it successfully flagged a **CRITICAL CHANGE** with a **94/100 Intent Score**.  



*  **The Swap:** It detected that a **Samsung 970 EVO NVMe** was replaced by a **Kingston A400 SATA**.  
*  **The Heuristics:** The score is high because the system detected an interface downgrade (NVMe to SATA) and a capacity decrease within a 12-minute ""Repair Window"".  
*  **Integrity:** I used a unique **Integrity Hash** (de7906...) to ensure that the report cannot be forged by the repair shop or the user.  

**The Struggle:** Building this in Morocco comes with unique challenges:

* **Infrastructure Costs:** My domain [**diagno.site**](http://diagno.site) is secured until 2027, but keeping high-performance servers running is expensive on a student budget.  
* **Financial Barriers:** Global platforms like Stripe and ""Buy Me a Coffee"" don't support Moroccan creators directly. I’ve had to find workarounds just to keep the project alive.

I’m looking for technical feedback on my detection logic. Is an **Intent Score** of 94/100 enough for a police report, or should I add more hardware telemetry?

1qmiywx,https://www.reddit.com/r/NextGenMan/comments/1qmiywx/i_practiced_flirting_with_women_for_30_days_and/,I practiced flirting with women for 30 days and here's what actually worked (and what spectacularly failed),"I've always been the guy who freezes up around attractive women. The guy who thinks of the perfect thing to say 3 hours later.

So I decided to run an experiment: 30 days of deliberate flirting practice. No pickup lines or manipulation tactics just genuine interactions with a specific focus on building romantic tension and expressing interest clearly.

What followed was equal parts humbling, educational. But by day 30, something had fundamentally shifted in how I communicate with women I'm attracted to.

Here's what I learned:

Days 1-7: The awkward phase

My first week was a masterclass in what NOT to do. In my head, I sounded smooth. In reality, I was a human cringe compilation.

Day 1: Tried complimenting a barista on her earrings and somehow ended up in a three-minute monologue about my aunt's jewelry collection. She looked genuinely concerned for my wellbeing.

Day 4: Attempted ""playful teasing"" with a woman at the gym. Called her form ""interesting"" during kettlebell swings. She thought I was a trainer about to correct her technique. When I clarified I was flirting, she just said ""Oh"" and walked away. After that I was considered moving to another country

Day 9: Had a conversation with a woman at a bookstore about the novel she was holding. Instead of trying to impress her with my literary knowledge, I asked genuine questions about what drew her to that author. The conversation flowed naturally for 15 minutes, ending with her suggesting a coffee shop nearby.

Day 12: The winning formula started becoming clear: curiosity + presence + patience = chemistry. I was learning that flirtation isn't about what you say but the energy you create.

Days 15-22: Earned confidence

By mid-experiment, patterns were emerging about what consistently worked versus what consistently failed.

What consistently failed:

Anything that felt like a ""line"" or prepared statement

Complimenting physical appearance as an opener

Trying to demonstrate value or intelligence

Any interaction where I was focused on the outcome rather than the moment

What consistently worked:

Genuine observations about something in our shared environment

Playful (but kind) banter that created emotional ping-pong

Light, brief touch at appropriate moments (like a touch on the arm during laughter)

Comfortable silence with maintained eye contact

The biggest revelation came on Day 19 at a friend's dinner party. I realized I was no longer ""practicing flirting"" I was just connecting with people while allowing attraction to exist without hiding it. My friend later told me that a woman had asked about me after the party, something that had rarely happened before.

Days 23-30: The outcome phase

The final week brought a profound insight: Effective flirting isn't a separate communication mode it's regular conversation with the volume turned up on certain elements:

More precise eye contact

Slightly more personal questions

More expressive reactions to their stories

More comfort with silence

More willingness to show vulnerability mixed with confidence

Day 26: Had lunch next to a woman at a café counter. Our conversation flowed from weather to travel to life philosophies without effort.

Day 30: Went to a social event and found myself flirting effortlessly with multiple women throughout the evening.

The true transformation wasn't becoming ""better at flirting"" but becoming more comfortable with myself in romantic contexts. The awkwardness never completely disappears (and honestly, a little awkwardness can be endearing), but the fear around it does.

1qmivxc,https://www.reddit.com/r/dankinindia/comments/1qmivxc/are_you_searching_what_is_aim_of_life/,are you searching what is aim of life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1qmituu,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMentalist/comments/1qmituu/inconsistencies_are_part_of_characterization/,Inconsistencies are part of characterization,"The Mentalist is my favorite show but I often critizise the writing, especially when it comes to the way they handled Red John. Still, I wanted to highlight one of the aspects that really works within the show: the characterization. 

An important thing to know when you write characters is to make them incoherent. Because inconsistencies make characters more realistic. In real life, we all have parts of ou personalities that from the outside look at odds with each others. We all have values that contradict some of our acts. It's because our personality is more of a guideline than a law. 

When you look at Jane, his storyline is about vengeance, manipulation, cold theories and shenanigans but the way he acts is almost childish at times. There is also the fact that he drinks tea which at first feels like a weird detail to add in a population who has a tendency to drink coffee but it makes him stand out. It gives us a reason to find him human and to sympathize with him. 

A funny thing in the dynamic between Jane and Lisbon is the fact that Jane, who is tracking a dangerous criminal to kill him, doesn't like guns whereas Lisbon, who is viewed within the show has having a higher moral ground or at least a morality that conforms to the society in which she lives, can't go anywhere without multiple guns. Feels very ironic! 

And I also love the fact that respecting the rules and doing what is reasonable is an inherent part of Lisbon's character but she has a problem with authority. She kind of considers that she is the only one able to decide what is good for her to do. If she doesn't like what her superiors tell her, she just goes rogue and it makes her relationship with Jane even better to watch. Like, she tells him not to cross boundaries and go over the board, and then she does the wildest things in the show like >!trying to stop a bomb on her own or standing in front of the FBI to help Jane get his revenge, thus becoming an accomplice of the murder. !<

And frankly, I love her for it. We usually see Jane as the wild one with his antics but when you look at Lisbon, she's a rebel kid too, she just cares more than Jane about what others think of her. 

All of this to say that it's not because the personality of a character leans in a certain way that everything has to be all black or all white. You can have fun by adding little details and explaining facets of characters that could seems paradoxical with the rest but will still makes sense. 

Really, I wanted to acknowledge that aspect of the writing because it deserves its flowers. ",5,1769346922.0,TheMentalist,0,0.86,False
1qmirbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1qmirbt/i_do_not_like_my_family/,I do not like my family,"I'm 18 years old and I hate my life at the moment. 

I live at home, even though I'm in university. I've begged my parents to allow me to move out, told them I was ready and so many of my friends are not living at home either. But they just won't budge, and they are making me more miserable every day.

I think all my friends and old teachers would be surprised by how different I am at home. If  you see me outside and with my friends I am usually laughing the loudest or talking non-stop. If I'm by myself, I feel at peace and usually content. But the moment I step foot into this house I feel miserable and want to be everywhere but here. 

It's not even like my parents are the worst people in the world, I just feel like they have it out for me. They lie about what I'm doing all the time, just recently I heard my mom on the phone with her sister talking about how I'm ""such a brat because I do not eat moroccan dishes, and she always has to make something else for me"", even though there's only one moroccan dish I dislike and whenever my mom makes it, I either shove it up my throat or I make myself something different, she has never once made an extra dish for me and I wouldn't even ask for that in the first place (fyi I'm Moroccan but live in Europe). Or I just accidentally broke my airpods (which I paid for myself) by accidentally dropping them on the floor, and my dad just yelled at me for 10 minutes calling me slurs like r\*\*\*\*\*, and then saying I can't do anything since i accidentally spilled 1 (one!!) drop of coffee on my study papers this morning.

I do admit I usually ignore them, or worse I answer back when they're going off at me by rolling my eyes or by just defending myself. These events happen at least 3 times a day. Because of the frequency of 'fights' I have with them every day, I just can't get myself to act normal around them whenever I'm not fighting with them. When they actually try to talk with me, or laugh with me, or go out with me, I usually do not show signs of happiness because I am just not happy whenever I am with them. This actually makes me feel guilty, but I can't help myself because I really cannot enjoy their company. 

I know they know I don't like them, and I know they don't like me most of the time since I don't really let them see any side of me that there is to like. I don't know if this will ever be solved, I honestly do not see myself reaching out to them when I'm older which is such a bad thing to say but I feel like I have to be honest here.

I’ve just published **UsenetStreamer v1.6.0**, and this release brings several **major improvements** focused on **playability**, **faster startup times**, and **better matching accuracy**.

This is one of the most meaningful updates so far.

# 🚀 What’s new in v1.6.0

# 1️⃣ Archive / Compression Check (Major Upgrade)

Until now, UsenetStreamer only performed basic health checks (like missing articles).

With v1.6.0, the addon now also verifies **whether the archive actually contains playable video files**.

What this means in practice:

* Releases **without playable video** are blocked
* **ISOs, double-archived content**, and other non-playable formats are filtered out
* **Green-tick NZBs are now guaranteed to contain playable video**

This significantly reduces failed streams and wasted clicks.

# 2️⃣ Pre-cache NZB in NZBDAV (Much Faster Start Times)

Since green-tick NZBs are now guaranteed to be playable, you can enable **pre-caching in NZBDAV**.

How this works:

* The **first green-tick NZB** (based on your sorting preference) is automatically pre-cached
* When you click play, **startup time is significantly reduced**
* If you start watching the *n*th episode, the \*(n+1)\*th episode is also pre-cached

Result: faster playback now, and **near-instant playback for the next episode** as well.

# 3️⃣ Bring Your Own TMDB Token (Better Matching)

Many movies and shows have **different titles across languages**,  
for example:

* Swedish releases
* Dubbed Tamil / Telugu movies

You can now provide **your own TMDB API key** to:

* Improve title matching accuracy
* Handle multilingual and regional naming differences more reliably

This greatly improves results for non-English content.

# 4️⃣ Easynews Health Check

Previously, **Easynews results skipped health checks**.

With v1.6.0:

* You can now enable **full health checks for Easynews results** as well
* This brings Easynews results to the same reliability level as other indexers

# 5️⃣ Indexer Fix

Some indexers were returning **incorrect files** when using the built-in **Newznab** integration.  
This issue has now been **fixed**, and results from those indexers are correctly mapped and filtered.

# 6️⃣ External Player Title Fix

When playing content in an external player, the title previously appeared as **“stream”**.

This has now been fixed - the **correct video title** is shown.

# 7️⃣ PWA Support (New!)

You can now **install UsenetStreamer as a PWA**.

This allows you to:

* Install the addon like an app
* Access it quickly without opening a browser tab
* Manage and configure everything more conveniently

This update makes UsenetStreamer **more reliable, faster to start, and much better at avoiding bad releases**.

# 📘 How to get started

There is a[ step-by-step setup guide](https://github.com/Sanket9225/UsenetStreamer/blob/master/docs/beginners-guide.md) in the GitHub repository, which covers:

* Requirements
* Installation process
* Configuration via web UI
* Stremio integration
* Troubleshooting

1qmiom8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qmiom8,Vintage-style speakers + new amp for small apartment,"

Hi everyone,
I hope it’s okay to ask for some guidance here, I’ve been reading along for a while and there’s clearly a lot of knowledge in this community.

I’ll be moving into a ~45 m² apartment soon and I’m planning to furnish it heavily inspired by a 1960s interior style. Audio matters a lot to me, both in terms of sound quality and aesthetics, and I’d really appreciate some advice before making any decisions.

Current setup (for context):
- B&W CM1 speakers
- Earthquake subwoofer
- Older NAD amplifier (NAD Viso Two), originally from my father

The system still works well, but I’d like to move to something more modern and better integrated, while keeping (or improving) sound quality.

The living room itself is about 20 m². I sit fairly close to the TV (coffee table in between), and wall-mounting the speakers next to or above the TV is a possibility.

My initial thought is to stay with 2.1 (two speakers + sub). In a room this size, I’m not sure how much I’d gain from a full 5.1 setup. That said, I don’t want to lock myself into a dead end either, so I’m curious whether planning for a possible future upgrade makes sense.

What I’m looking for:
- Speakers with a vintage / retro appearance (60s look)
- New or used is fine; used especially if it’s genuinely older gear rather than recent expensive items without warranty
- I’ve looked briefly at speakers like the JBL L52, but I’m unsure whether that would be a real upgrade over the B&W CM1
- I’ve always liked the B&W sound, but I’m very open to other brands

Amplification / receiver:
- New
- HDMI ARC and optical inputs
- Enough connectivity for multiple sources
- Built-in Spotify (or similar streaming) would be a big plus
- Should integrate well with a Sony turntable (vinyl is important to me)

Usage:
- Films / Netflix / series
- Gaming (PC → TV → audio at the moment; currently no Dolby)
- Music listening (very important)
- Vinyl playback

Music taste (roughly):
Mostly 60s/70s rock, folk and psychedelic, but also post-punk, alternative and some modern artists, e.g. Armand, Led Zeppelin, Fleetwood Mac, Tom Petty, The Smiths, Radiohead, Talking Heads, Cream, Pixies, TV Girl, Thundercat, Oliver Tree, etc.

I’d really appreciate thoughts on:
- Whether sticking with 2.1 makes sense here, or if I should already think more seriously about a future 5.1 path
- Speaker suggestions that fit both sonically and visually
- A sensible direction for the amplifier/receiver that ties everything together well

Thanks in advance, I’m very happy to learn, and I appreciate any insight you’re willing to share.",1,1769346533.0,hometheater,0,1.0,False

Sounds manageable, but does it really help? Let’s get into it ...

# 👩‍🎨 Real Experience with The Smoothie Diet™ (via Lauren, a Friend from My Yoga Class)

Lauren’s one of those people you always see with a mason jar in hand—usually green, occasionally purple, always blended.

We met in a local yoga class a while back, and she’s been my go-to for smoothie inspo ever since. So when she told me she’d just wrapped up [The Smoothie Diet](https://theworldhealth.org/smoothie-diet-official)**™**, I had to get the scoop.

She’s a freelance illustrator and works from home, which means she’s just a few steps from the fridge at all times—*temptation central*.

For her, snacking had become more about boredom than hunger, and she felt it was catching up fast. “I wasn’t trying to become a supermodel,” she told me, “I just wanted to zip up my jeans again without threatening the zipper’s life.”

Lauren stuck with the full 21 days, swapping breakfast and lunch for smoothies while keeping dinner relaxed but clean.

She loved the **fruit smoothies that burn fat**—especially the ones with pineapple and mint—and said the **shopping lists and prep guide** helped her avoid that “what am I doing?” fridge stare at 7 a.m.

By the end of week two, she noticed her energy picking up—she wasn’t dragging through afternoon Zoom calls, and her skin looked noticeably brighter.

She did say a few of the smoothies were too sweet for her taste, especially the banana-heavy ones. “I just threw in a little spinach or cucumber to calm them down,” she said. “Easy fix.”

Lauren ended up losing 7 pounds without counting a single calorie.

Next week an old friend is coming to stay with me and my partner for a few days. They visit a few times a year, but this is the first time since she’s come out openly as a trans woman. It’s been about 6 months and she does a good job passing as a cis woman but I’m still slightly worried.

We live in a depressing run down seaside town in the south of the UK where, to the older generation particularly, men are men, women belong in the kitchen, and even the newfangled concept of being gay or lesbian is enough to warrant sideways looks and snide comments.

For some context I work in a shipyard (admittedly not an industry famed for tolerance or diversity). There is to my knowledge only one non-cis person working here and though most colleagues have the decency to be civil to his face, once out of earshot most fall somewhere on the spectrum between cracking jokes about tits and inflatable cocks, and gammon-faced open transphobia/ranting about gender neutral toilets and speculating about what they’d do if they met him in a dark alley. I really feel for him tbh and kinda wish he was somewhere more tolerant, but our paths rarely cross and we’re only vaguely acquainted.

Anyway.

My friend and I won’t be going anywhere near the shipyard, thankfully, but as a first time trans-ally-friend i just want to be somewhat prepared and know how best to deal with people in public places being pricks. 

Say for instance someone in a cafe starts making snide remarks and trying to elicit a reaction.

I’m a bit autistic, not very good at arguments and tend to come up with snappy replies 10 minutes after any confrontation is over. And I’m a lover not a fighter so i don’t think I’ll particularly be intimidating anyone into silence.

So, If something like this happens, what do? 
What should i definitely **not** do? 
Keep my head down and finish my coffee and cake or call them out?

Advice on a postcard please, i just want to be the best friend i can. Maybe I’m overthinking this. 

Sorry if I’m misusing any terminology, I’m new to this!

My partner and I are both very clear that we don’t want children. I’m genuinely happy with my life as it is, and this decision isn’t something I’m confused or conflicted about.

A close friend of mine (around 40) already has a 4-year-old and is currently pregnant with her second. We met for dinner recently, the night itself was actually great, good food, nice conversation. Small detail but relevant: on my way to meet her, I twisted my foot pretty badly. I still went to the restaurant, because I wanted to meet her as I know she does not have so much time to met friends.

At some point, the topic of kids came up (as it often does), and she asked me again if I was still sure about not wanting to be a mother. I told her yes, very clearly, that I don’t want kids, it’s not my life focus, I’m happy, and both my partner and I are aligned on this.

She wasn’t aggressive or mean, but she kept pushing the idea in a softer way: motherhood is beautiful, thar there’s no age limit, etc. I repeated that no, we don’t want children. Still, I walked away feeling like I had to justify my decision yet again, as if “I don’t want to” isn’t enough.

What made it feel extra strange was the timing. I was literally sitting there with a hurt foot, clearly in pain, and somehow the conversation shifted into questioning one of my biggest life choices, something that had nothing to do with the moment. She did show concern about my foot, so it wasn’t a lack of care, but the whole thing felt… oddly misplaced.

I also got the sense that she might be dealing with her own stress (she hinted at needing space, and mentioned she traveling alone this weekend), so maybe this was more about her than me. Still, it left me uncomfortable.

And now I’m writing this from my bed, foot resting, with a bowl of cereal and yogurt and a cup of coffee my partner brought me. I feel calm, taken care of, and honestly very grateful in this moment for the life we’ve chosen and for not having kids. This kind of quiet, softness, and space feels right to me.

Do you ever feel like some parents need you to keep the door open, even after you’ve closed it clearly and calmly?

How do you deal with friends who don’t fully accept your childfree decision  not aggressively, but persistently?

I'd hand him his cup and take mine with whatever book I was reading at the time and stretch out beside him, as he never wanted me too far away. I'd smooch him on the cheek mischievously and he would smile and tell me he loved me and give me that look that would make me melt and get goosebumps all at once.

Me and my mom get to the church and I’m super nervous since I haven’t been to church since I was very very young, and my medication was starting to kick in which gave me even more butterflies of anticipation. As we are walking up to the church someone who I can only presume to be the Priest greets us and walks in but the door to the church is closed, and there’s a sign on the door which says service begins at 10:30, which confused me since I thought it always started from 9 and you could turn up anytime as long as it’s not after 10. 

So me and my mom walk back to the car and drive to a coffee shop and sit in there, then it turns 10:20 so we drive back up and this time it’s open. 

Me and her walk in and it’s not at all what I expected, the iconostasis is there and there’s are lots of icons and candles, I didn’t know what to do and where to stand as it was quite a small church so I ask the guy next to me where I go or what I do as it’s my first time and he says we usually wait for the Priest. Me and my mom are then greeted by another man who tells us the priest is ill at the moment so there will be no full service today, and explains how Orthodox Christianity is very personal, people come and go at whatever time they please and tells us to make ourselves at home. Me and my mom stand for a while and I end up sitting down as the service begins. They light the oil lamps in front of the icons in the iconostasis and they begin to read from the Old Testament.

My mom isn’t at all religious, but she’s not anti religion. She’s a spiritual person but she doesn’t believe in the father the son and the Holy Spirit so I was wondering why she was with me or even offered to come but I guess she wanted to give it a chance. 

People begin to come in and light candles, kiss icons and make the sign of the cross and as the Old Testament is being read, and as the trinity is invoked I too make the sign of the cross like everyone else.

Then they began singing and oh my.  There were 3 people singing but it sounded more like 100. 

I haven’t heard anything that majestic in a very long time, I stopped focusing on how long the service had left and started focusing on the hymns. There were kids playing with toy cars but nobody seemed bothered or distracted, everyone was stood up apart from me and my mom but nobody seemed bothered that we were sat down which was nice. The service ended at I have no idea what time and at the end the food was blessed and everyone began to eat and talk, I only talked to the priests wife (I’m not a very talkative person when it comes to religion and I’m not very sociable in general.) She told me how he was ill and has Parkinson’s along side another illness but he was improving. I give her my number so she can add me to the church WhatsApp group and we talk for 5 minutes and then I leave.

Coming into it I was super nervous but honestly everyone was super welcoming and kind and it was nice to feel close to God. The icons were beautiful to look at whilst listening and honestly I can see why people call them a window into heaven. 

If your nervous and reading this and nervous about your first time don’t worry! It’ll all be fine I was super nervous but everyone was lovely, remember your in a house of God alongside God’s children. Everyone has nothing but kind hearts. ",21,1769345364.0,OrthodoxChristianity,6,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.

1qmi8in,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mensfashion101/comments/1qmi8in/how_do_i_stay_stylish_during_winter_without/,How do I stay stylish during winter without actually freezing?,"
You know, during winter, everyone is more concerned about protecting themselves from the cold. This kind of makes it difficult to look stylish while still trying to protect yourself from the cold. So basically, I have spent every winter for the past few years looking like a total mess. I mostly just pile on the thickest hoodies I own under a massive puffer jacket. This has really been a great move, especially when I grab a hot coffee from a cafe on my way out.

I’ve noticed that I only think about how stylish I look when it is not winter. Once it gets to winter, it’s as if I had lost all desire to dress up. However, this year, I want to do something different. I want to also maintain that stylish look even if it’s cold and freezing outside. I’ve already taken it a step further to search for men winter clothes on Amazon, Temu, Etsy, and even Alibaba. Although I’ve seen a couple of stylish winter clothes for men, I still need practical dressing advice from people. 

I believe I can get answers on style inspo and fabrics that look stylish from this subreddit. So guys, I need all the recommendations I can get. I need to do all my shopping now before winter arrives. Thank you!",1,1769345269.0,Mensfashion101,3,0.67,False

about me: early 20s, working in tech in bangalore. quiet, low-drama guy who enjoys cafes, long walks and real convos. honestly, my weekends have been boring as hell lately—just scrolling and existing—and i really want to change that. i’ve spent the last few years grinding on skills, so i’m new to dating but ready to try.

why i’m here: dating apps felt shallow and too 🪝-up-heavy. i’m looking for something real, honest and slow-build. i'm all about exploration—platonic is totally fine, friends first is cool, i just want a connection that evolves naturally without the pressure.

what i’m about:

calm and thoughtful, listen more than i talk. i love hearing how things... and people... work.

deep talks > small talk. tell me about your passions, not just your day.

not into drama.

prefer 1 on 1 stuff: coffee/tea, parks, long walks, late night talks.

creative and curious, like building/learning random skills.

what i’m looking for: someone kind, emotionally mature and curious. more than that, i want a partner, not an echo.

on vibe: you don’t have to agree on everything to connect. a person is always bigger than one opinion. i value honesty and the freedom to be ourselves. i’ll respect your worldview and i’m looking for someone who’ll do the same.

if your instinct when you disagree is to shut down, we won’t match. but if you can see the whole person and handle differences with curiosity instead of judgment, that’s what i’m after.

beyond that, consistency and matched energy are HUGE for me. i'm looking for someone whose actions actually line up with their words. if you're a clear communicator who believes in showing up, not just showing interest, we'll get along great.

and a quick heads-up on my communication style:

i’m a very direct person because i value clarity and honesty above everything. you can expect me to ask real questions early on, because i'm here to build a genuine connection, not just stay in shallow small talk.

i’d rather hear ""hey this isn't a vibe"" than deal with ghosting. clear and kind endings > confusion. let's RESPECT each other's time.

but also, if you're someone who just drops a ""hey"", trades a few surface-level messages, and bails before even trying to know the person, please don't bother texting. at that point, saying ""this isn't a vibe"" is just lazy, because you haven't even understood the words yet, let alone the vibe. i'm not here to be someone's pass-time or validation hit. i value real effort. if you can’t bring that, it’s perfectly okay... but this space isn’t for you.

ambiguity is fine, but only when it's honest. an upfront ""hey, i'm not sure yet"" is a thousand times better than mixed signals. i'll always give you that same respect and directness in return... overall, i’m not here to impress, i’m here to express.

so, if you've actually read this far and you're on the same page, please send a DM. i'm not against 'hi', but to show you get the vibe, please skip the intro and instead tell me two things: your ideal lazy weekend, and one song you've had on repeat lately. this will let me know that you actually read the entire post.

1qmi4cz,https://www.reddit.com/r/smpearth/comments/1qmi4cz/whats_meaning_of_life_here_is_that_meaning/,what's meaning of life ? here is that meaning - pratisarantu,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I don't approach guys and I am usually not approached by any guy irl. I've made peace with it.

Now, good guys, introverts or what so ever, have this thing where they think they are entitled to a piece of something because they did a gesture.

This guy I've met online made the nice gesture of coming to my town to give me a box of chocolates. I suggested a coffee where I'd meet him half way and he denied. Ok, if he insists...

He gave me the chocolates,  we talked about 10 minutes, and when saying good bye he expected more. I gave a gentle and quick lips kiss but I was embarrassed and just left.

When he texted me back afterwards he said he deserved  a kiss or even more...

Come on. I don't need someone to buy me chocolates.  I appreciate the gesture, but I don't kiss people I don't know. 

I said we could meet another day (like a proper date) but apparently that wasn't good enough.

And I wounder why women stay away from guys. 

I don't use the ""strong independent woman"" speech.  I am independent because I have to work to pay bills. But the mean cells inside me tell me to stay away from guys because they think they can buy me out with gifts?

1qmi2kj,https://i.redd.it/zr6r6zkgqhfg1.jpeg,Link?,"THE 100-POINT DIVORCE PLAN

For three years, I documented the slow death of my marriage in a black journal. It was my 100-point divorce plan: for every time my husband, Blake, chose his first love, Ariana, over me, I deducted points. When the score hit zero, I would leave.  The final points vanished the night he left me bleeding out from a car crash. I was eight weeks pregnant with the child we had prayed for.  In the ER, the nurses frantically called him-the star surgeon of the very hospital I was dying in.  ""Dr. Santos, we have a Jane Doe, O-negative, bleeding out. She's pregnant, and we're about to lose them both. We need you to authorize an emergency blood transfer.""  His voice came over the speaker, cold and impatient.  ""I can't. My priority is Miss Whitfield. Do what you can for the patient, but I can't divert anything right now.""  He hung up. He condemned his own child to death to ensure his ex-girlfriend had resources on standby after a minor procedure.  Chapter 1 Blake Santos never expected to find the notebook.   He was searching for his favorite platinum cufflinks, a gift from his father, in the back of the shared closet. His fingers brushed against a leather-bound journal tucked away in a shoebox, hidden behind Caroline's winter boots. It wasn't hers; her journals were always brightly colored, filled with architectural sketches. This one was plain black. Curiosity, a rare emotion for him, took hold. He opened it.  The first page was titled in Caroline's neat, precise handwriting: The 100-Point Divorce Plan.  Blake frowned. He read the rules written below.  Starting Points: 100.  For every action that proves this marriage is a mistake, points will be deducted.  When the score reaches zero, I will file for divorce. No exceptions.  He let out a short, humorless laugh. A game. It had to be some silly game his wife was playing. He flipped through the pages. Each entry was dated, a meticulous log of his supposed transgressions.  -1 Point: He forgot our anniversary. Again. He was having dinner with Ariana.  -2 Points: He canceled our vacation because Ariana's dog was sick. He spent the weekend at her apartment.  -1 Point: He called me Ariana by mistake.  -3 Points: He bought the last bottle of a vintage wine I'd been searching for, only to give it to Ariana for her birthday.  The list went on, page after page. A detailed, painful chronicle of his neglect. Blake felt a flicker of annoyance, not guilt. He saw it not as a record of his failures, but as a testament to Caroline's obsession with his friendship with Ariana Whitfield. Ariana was his first love, the one who had shattered him when she left years ago.   Caroline knew that. He had married Caroline on the rebound, a convenient, stable choice from a good family, a person who could manage the Santos household while he focused on his career and, if he was honest, nursed his broken heart.  He shut the notebook, his annoyance hardening into cold indifference. He tossed it back into the box. A ridiculous, childish list. It meant nothing. He found his cufflinks and shut the closet door, the notebook already fading from his mind. He had more important things to think about. He had a custom-made necklace for Ariana in his briefcase. Her art gallery was having its grand opening, and he needed to be there.  He walked into the living room. Caroline was on the couch, sketching on a large pad, her brow furrowed in concentration. She looked up when he entered, a hopeful light in her eyes that he had long ago stopped noticing.  ""You're home early,"" she said, her voice soft.  ""I have to go out again soon,"" he replied, loosening his tie. ""Ariana's gallery opening.""   The light in her eyes dimmed. ""Oh. Right.""   He saw the notebook on the coffee table, a different one, one of her sketchbooks. He glanced at an open page. It was a drawing of a nursery, detailed and full of soft light. A crib, a mobile with tiny stars, a rocking chair. He felt a strange pang in his chest, an unfamiliar emotion he couldn't place. They had been trying for a child for over a year.  ""Is that for a client?"" he asked, his voice flat.  Caroline quickly closed the sketchbook. ""Just an idea.""   He didn't press. He didn't care. His mind was on Ariana. He looked at the clock. He should leave soon. He wanted to be the first one there, to see her face when she saw the necklace.  He stood there, a silent wall between them, when his phone rang. It was his best friend, Mark.  ""Blake! Turn on the news! Now!"" Mark's voice was frantic.  Blake grabbed the remote and switched on the television. A live news report filled the screen. A building was engulfed in flames. Thick black smoke billowed into the night sky. The reporter's voice was urgent.  ""Firefighters are on the scene at the new Whitfield Gallery downtown, where a massive fire broke out just an hour before its scheduled grand opening...""   Blake's blood ran cold.  Ariana.  The world narrowed to that single thought. He grabbed his keys, his coat, and bolted for the door without a word to Caroline. He didn't look back. He didn't see the look of utter devastation on her face as she watched him go.  Caroline followed him. She didn't know why. Some desperate, foolish part of her needed to see it for herself. She drove through the city, her hands tight on the steering wheel, her heart pounding a sick rhythm against her ribs.  When she arrived, the scene was chaos. Police barricades, flashing lights, the roar of the fire. Blake had abandoned his car and was arguing with a firefighter, his face a mask of raw panic.  ""She's in there! I have to get her!"" Blake yelled, trying to push past the man.  ""Sir, it's too dangerous! The structure is unstable!"" the firefighter shouted back.  ""I don't care! She's trapped!""   Mark was there, trying to restrain him. ""Blake, calm down! They'll get her!""   ""They're not fast enough!"" Blake's voice was ragged with a desperation Caroline had never heard from him. Not for her. Never for her. He looked at the burning building as if it held his entire world. In that moment, Caroline knew it did.  He shoved Mark away and made a run for the entrance.  ""My hands!"" he screamed at the firefighter who grabbed his arm. ""Do you know who I am? I'm Blake Santos! These hands are insured for millions! They perform miracles! But I would trade them, I would trade my entire career, just to know she's safe! Let me go!""   It was a declaration. A confession. A truth so brutal it felt like a physical blow.  Mark saw Caroline then, standing in the shadows, her face pale. He looked horrified.  ""Caroline... I...""   She heard Mark's wife, Sarah, whisper to him, ""God, Mark, he's been obsessed with Ariana since high school. I thought marrying Caroline would fix him, but he's just gotten worse.""   Sarah's words confirmed everything. It wasn't just neglect. It was a love story she had no part in. She was just an obstacle. An afterthought.  For three years, she had tried. She had loved him with everything she had, hoping that one day he would see her. She had decorated their home, managed his social obligations, comforted him after long surgeries, and endured his family's cold scrutiny. She had believed her love could eventually heal his old wounds, that it could be enough.  It was a lie she had told herself. The truth had been there all along, in every missed anniversary, every canceled plan, every time he looked through her as if she were made of glass.  The 100-point plan wasn't a game. It was a lifeline. A way to quantify the slow, bleeding death of her love. A way to give herself a finish line, an escape hatch from a marriage that was hollowing her out. And tonight, watching him ready to burn for another woman, she felt a massive chunk of those points crumble away.  A cheer went up from the crowd. Blake emerged from the smoke, carrying Ariana in his arms. She was conscious, coughing, but otherwise seemed unharmed. He held her like she was the most precious thing in the world, his face buried in her hair. He carried her to the ambulance, whispering things only she could hear.  He never once looked for Caroline.  After ensuring Ariana was safely with the paramedics, Blake's body finally gave out. The adrenaline faded, and he collapsed to the ground, unconscious from smoke inhalation.  In the sterile white waiting room of the hospital, the smell of antiseptic sharp in her nose, Caroline's mind drifted back. She remembered the charity gala where she first met him. He was the most brilliant, captivating man she had ever seen. A star neurosurgeon from the powerful Santos family. She, a promising young architect, had been bold. She had pursued him.  He had been grieving Ariana's marriage to another man. She knew that. But when he proposed six months later, she thought she had won. She thought her devotion had finally broken through his reserve.  The illusion shattered a year into their marriage. At a party, she overheard one of Blake's friends, drunk and loose-lipped, telling someone the truth. ""Blake only married her because Ariana got married. He needed a distraction, a wife to satisfy his family. Poor girl thinks he actually loves her.""   That was the day Ariana became a thorn in her heart, a constant, painful presence in her marriage. It was the day she went out and bought the plain black journal. It was her last act of self-preservation. A way to measure the pain until it became too much to bear.  Ariana's return to Boston after her own divorce a year ago had accelerated everything. The points on her list disappeared with terrifying speed. Her heart, once full of hope, had grown cold and heavy.  A doctor approached her, pulling her from her thoughts. ""Mrs. Santos? Your husband is stable. He inhaled a lot of smoke, but he'll be fine. Miss Whitfield is also fine, just a few scratches.""   Mark and Sarah came over, their faces etched with pity. ""Caroline, he'll come to his senses,"" Sarah said, placing a hand on her arm. ""The Santos family will make sure he treats you right.""   Caroline just looked at them, a bitter taste in her mouth. She stood up and walked out of the waiting room, leaving them behind.  Back home, in the silent, empty house, she walked to the closet and took out the black journal. She opened it to the last entry.  -5 Points: He ran into a burning building for her.  -10 Points: He said he would give up his career for her.  She uncapped her pen. Her hand was steady.  -10 Points: He collapsed after saving her, and his first and last thought was of her, not me.  She did the math. Only a few points left. Very few. The end was near.  Chapter 2 The next morning, Caroline didn't go to the hospital. She went to see a lawyer. The office was on the 30th floor of a glass skyscraper, with a view of the entire city. It felt fitting. She was finally getting a new perspective.  She handed over a file containing her prenuptial agreement and a summary of her assets.  ""I want to file for divorce,"" she stated, her voice calm and even. ""I want to prepare the papers now, so they are ready to be signed the moment I decide.""   The lawyer, a sharp woman named Ms. Davis, looked at her with professional sympathy. ""Of course, Mrs. Santos. We can have everything drafted and waiting for your signal.""   Leaving the lawyer's office, Caroline felt a strange sense of lightness. It wasn't happiness, but it was a release. She stopped at a small cafe and bought a container of chicken noodle soup and a thermos of hot tea, the kind Blake liked when he was sick. It was a force of habit, the ghost of a duty she had performed for years.  When she arrived at the hospital, she paused outside Blake's room. Through the glass panel in the door, she saw Ariana sitting by his bed. She was trying to feed him soup, but her movements were clumsy. She spilled a spoonful on his hospital gown, then another on the pristine white sheets.  ""Oh, I'm so sorry, Blake!"" Ariana cried, dabbing at the mess with a napkin. ""I'm just so useless.""   ""It's okay,"" Blake's voice was hoarse but gentle. He reached up and wiped a tear from her cheek. ""It's just soup.""   ""But you're hurt because of me,"" she sobbed, her shoulders shaking. ""The doctor said the smoke inhalation was severe. It could have damaged your lungs, your hands... your career...""   ""Shh,"" he soothed her. ""It was worth it. As long as you're safe.""   Ariana looked at him, her eyes wide and shining with adoration. ""You always wanted to be a neurosurgeon. You gave up your dream of being a painter for it.""   Blake's gaze softened. ""I didn't give it up. I became a surgeon because of you.""   Ariana looked confused. ""What do you mean?""   ""Do you remember that day in high school?"" he asked, his voice low. ""You fell off the bleachers and hit your head. You were unconscious for almost a minute. I've never been so scared in my life. That was the day I decided I wanted to be a doctor. The best doctor. So I could always be there to save you if you needed me.""   The soup container slipped from Caroline's hand, falling to the floor with a soft thud. She didn't notice. The words echoed in her head, a deafening roar.  His entire career. His life's ambition. It was all for Ariana.  Ariana gasped, her hand flying to her mouth. ""Blake... I never knew.""   She threw herself into his arms, burying her face in his chest. ""Oh, Blake.""   He hesitated for only a second, his eyes flickering towards the door as if he sensed something. But then his arms wrapped around her, holding her tight. A perfect, painful tableau of love and devotion.  Caroline felt a sharp, suffocating pain in her chest. Her vision blurred. She turned and walked away, her steps silent and numb. She left the soup and tea on the floor outside his door.  Downstairs, in the hospital lobby, she bumped into one of Blake's colleagues, Dr. Evans. He was rushing, a stack of files in his hands.  ""Caroline! I was just coming to see Blake. How is he?""   ""He's fine,"" she said, her voice hollow.  ""Good, good. Listen, I have an emergency surgery. Can you give this to him?"" He thrust a manila folder into her hands. ""It's his resignation paperwork from the research board. He needs to sign it.""   ""Resignation?"" Caroline asked, confused. Blake loved his position on the research board.  ""Yeah, he's stepping down to fund a new private clinic. Crazy, right? Sacrificing his own research... but he said it's for someone important."" Dr. Evans's pager went off. ""Gotta run!""   He disappeared down the hall. Caroline stood alone in the bustling lobby, holding the folder. Her hands trembled as she opened it. Inside was Blake's official letter of resignation. And clipped to it was the business proposal for the new clinic.  It was a state-of-the-art mental health and wellness facility. The primary beneficiary and director listed on the proposal was Ariana Whitfield.  The world tilted on its axis. It wasn't just his past. It was his future, too. Every part of his life was built around Ariana. He had become a doctor for her. Now he was giving up his prestigious research position to build a sanctuary for her.  Caroline was just a name on a marriage certificate. A placeholder. A ghost in her own life.  She thought of the day he'd been celebrated for a groundbreaking surgical technique. She had been so proud, her heart swelling with love for this brilliant, dedicated man. Now she realized, with sickening clarity, that even that moment belonged to Ariana. Every achievement, every success, was just another step on his path back to his first love.  It was time to get off that path. It was time to find her own.  She walked out of the hospital and into the bright, unforgiving sunlight. She pulled out her phone and dialed a number she hadn't called in years.  Bridget Kelly. Her best friend from architecture school. The one who had always told her she was meant for more than just being Mrs. Blake Santos.  Bridget picked up on the second ring. ""Caroline? Is that you?""   ""It's me,"" Caroline said, her voice surprisingly steady. ""You know that architecture firm we always dreamed of opening?""   There was a pause, then Bridget's voice, full of excitement. ""Are you serious?""   ""I'm serious,"" Caroline said, a faint smile touching her lips for the first time in what felt like a lifetime. ""I'm leaving Blake. I'm ready to start.""   ""Oh, thank God!"" Bridget squealed. ""I'll start looking for office space! Something in Boston, close to your home, so it's convenient for you?""   Caroline looked up at the skyline, at the towering buildings she had once dreamed of designing.  ""No,"" she said, her voice clear and firm. ""Not Boston. Somewhere new. Somewhere far away from here.""  Chapter 3 Caroline told Bridget she was getting a divorce and wanted to set up their firm, ""Phoenix Arch,"" in San Francisco. Bridget, ever loyal, asked no questions and immediately started making arrangements. The name felt right. A new life rising from the ashes of her old one.  For the next week, Caroline lived in a blur of activity. She bought books on modern design, building codes, and business management. She spent hours online, studying the work of top architects, her mind once again buzzing with the creative energy she had suppressed for years. She felt a part of herself, long dormant, waking up.  She didn't call Blake. She didn't visit the hospital. She ignored the texts from his mother demanding to know why she wasn't by her husband's side. She was building a firewall around her heart, brick by brick.  A week later, on the day of their third wedding anniversary, Blake came home. He found her in the home office, surrounded by stacks of books and blueprints.  He looked surprised. ""What's all this?""   ""I'm going back to work,"" Caroline said, not looking up from her drafting table. ""Bridget and I are starting our own firm.""   ""That's... great,"" he said, though he sounded more confused than pleased. He was used to her life revolving around him. ""I guess you won't have time to make my post-surgery recovery meals anymore.""   Caroline finally looked at him. Her gaze was cool, distant. ""No. I won't.""   He remembered how she used to fuss over him, a tiny papercut earning his hand a bandage and a week of her worried attention. Her sudden indifference was strange, but he dismissed it. He was tired.  ""Well, I support you,"" he said, the words feeling hollow even to him. ""It's good for you to have a hobby.""   A hobby. Three years of marriage, and he still saw her lifelong passion as a hobby.  ""Blake,"" she began, her voice low. ""If I said I wanted a divorce, would you fight it?""   Before he could answer, his phone rang. He glanced at the screen. It was Ariana.  ""Excuse me,"" he said, walking into his study and closing the door.  Caroline could hear the low murmur of his voice, the gentle, soothing tone he never used with her. She didn't need to hear the words. She knew. She turned back to her blueprints, her resolve hardening into steel.  Later that evening, he emerged from the study. ""I'm taking you out for our anniversary,"" he announced.  She agreed. There was one last thing she needed to see.  He drove them to a fancy downtown restaurant. He pulled up to the curb. ""I'll go park. You go on in.""   She got out of the car and watched him drive off. A few minutes later, he returned, not alone. He was holding a huge bouquet of white gardenias and a beautifully wrapped gift box. For a dizzying second, her heart stuttered. He had never given her flowers. Not once.  ""Blake..."" she started, a flicker of some old, foolish hope igniting within her.  And then Ariana appeared at his side, linking her arm through his.  ""Caroline! So good to see you,"" Ariana said, her smile bright and triumphant. ""Blake told me you were joining us to celebrate my gallery's successful relaunch. It's so sweet of you.""   The flicker of hope died, turning to ash.  Blake didn't seem to notice Caroline's frozen expression. He smiled at Ariana.  ""These are for you,"" he said, handing her the flowers and the gift. ""A little something to celebrate.""   It was for Ariana. Of course, it was for Ariana. The dinner, the flowers, the gift. She was just the third wheel. A prop in their perfect love story.  ""Oh, Blake, you remembered,"" Ariana cooed, burying her face in the gardenias. ""They're my favorite."" She unwrapped the gift to reveal the diamond necklace he had been so excited about. ""And this... it's the exact one I pinned on my inspiration board last month. How did you know?""   ""Just a lucky guess,"" Blake said, his eyes fixed on Ariana, a soft, loving expression on his face.  Caroline felt the air leave her lungs. She was suffocating. She reached out and took the bouquet from Ariana's hands, forcing a smile onto her face.  ""Let me hold these for you,"" she said, her voice a strained whisper. Her hands were trembling.  Ariana beamed. ""Thank you, Caroline. You're such a good wife.""   The words were a mockery. Caroline knew then that Blake hadn't just brought her along. He had used her. He had used their anniversary as a cover to celebrate with the woman he truly loved. She was not his wife. She was his excuse.  Chapter 4 Ariana led the way into the restaurant, which was the same one where the accident had happened. It had been quickly renovated and reopened. She pointed out the new decorations, her hand resting possessively on Blake's arm.  ""I always dreamed of having a place like this, Blake,"" she said wistfully. ""A space for art and beauty.""   ""I remember,"" Blake said, his voice soft. ""You wanted high ceilings, exposed brick, and a crystal chandelier right in the center. You said it would 'drip starlight.'""   Ariana looked at him, amazed. ""You remember that? I said that when we were seventeen.""   ""I remember everything you've ever said,"" he replied, and the sincerity in his voice was a knife in Caroline's gut.  They were seated in a private booth. Blake took the menu, his eyes scanning it with practiced ease. ""We'll have the seared scallops, the truffle risotto, and the duck confit.""   Ariana laughed, a light, tinkling sound. ""Blake, you ordered all my favorites. You should ask Caroline what she likes."" She said it with an air of sweet concern, but her eyes, when they met Caroline's, were sharp with malice.  Blake turned to Caroline, a blank look on his face. He pushed the menu towards her. ""Sorry. I... I don't know what you like to eat.""   Three years. For three years, she had cooked for him, ordered for him, packed his lunches. He had eaten the food she prepared every single day, and he didn't know. He didn't know the simplest thing about her.  The humiliation was a physical force, pressing down on her, making it hard to breathe. She saw the smug satisfaction in Ariana's eyes, the casual indifference in Blake's. It was all too much.  ""Excuse me,"" Caroline said, her voice tight. She stood up and pushed her way out of the booth. ""I need some air.""   She walked quickly towards the exit, desperate to escape the suffocating weight of their shared history. She heard footsteps behind her. It was Ariana.  ""Let me show you the way to the powder room,"" Ariana said, her voice dripping with false kindness.  In the empty corridor, Ariana dropped the act. She blocked Caroline's path.  ""You should just give up, you know,"" Ariana said, her voice low and cold. ""You see how he is with me. He remembers every little thing about me. He doesn't even know your favorite food. You're just a placeholder, Caroline. A temporary solution until I was ready to come back to him.""   Every word was a confirmation of a truth Caroline already knew, but hearing it spoken aloud was still devastating.  ""He loves me,"" Ariana continued, her smile turning cruel. ""He built his career for me. He ran into a burning building for me. He's giving up his future for me. What has he ever done for you?""   Caroline felt a wave of dizziness. The walls seemed to be closing in.  ""What do you want, Ariana?"" Caroline asked, her voice shaking.  ""I want you to leave,"" Ariana said simply. ""He's mine. He has always been mine. You're just in the way.""   As she spoke, there was a loud creaking sound from above. Both women looked up. The large, ornate chandelier-the replacement for the one that had fallen before-was swaying ominously.  A collective gasp went through the restaurant, followed by screams.  Blake came running. His eyes darted between the two women and the falling chandelier. There was a split second of hesitation. A choice.  He lunged for Ariana.  He wrapped his arms around her, pulling her back, shielding her with his body as the massive fixture of crystal and metal crashed to the ground right where Caroline was standing.  The last thing Caroline saw before the world exploded in pain and went dark was Blake holding Ariana, his back to her, protecting the only person who mattered.  She woke to the blinding lights of a hospital ceiling. Every part of her body screamed in agony. Her head was bandaged, her arm was in a cast, and a sharp pain radiated from her abdomen. The room was empty. There were no flowers. No concerned husband. She was alone.  A nurse came in, her face grim. She checked Caroline's vitals.  ""You're very lucky, Mrs. Santos. You have a concussion, a broken arm, and multiple lacerations. But you're alive.""   Caroline looked at the empty chair beside her bed.  She reached for the small purse on her nightstand. Inside, wrapped in a silk cloth, was the black journal. She found a pen. Her hand ached, but she wrote with grim determination.  -15 Points: He watched a chandelier fall on me and didn't even try to help. He chose her.  A young nurse's aide came in to change her IV bag. She saw the notebook. ""What's that?"" she asked, her curiosity piqued.  ""It's a scorecard for my marriage,"" Caroline said, her voice flat. ""When it hits zero, the game is over.""   The aide leaned closer, her eyes wide. ""Wow. You're almost there. Only five points left.""   Just then, the door opened, and Blake walked in. He looked tired and disheveled. He had been with Ariana. Of course, he had.  ""What are you two talking about?"" he asked, his gaze falling on the open journal in Caroline's hand",2,1769344787.0,romancenovels,2,1.0,False

1qmi18c,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeensofKerala/comments/1qmi18c/giriettan/,Giriettan,"I joined an IT company for my internship, which lasted six months. Like everyone else, I was excited to see new people in the office. But honestly, my office wasn’t that fun because most of the employees were much older. A few of us were Gen Z, but we were all in different departments.

And that’s where the story begins.

As an intern, I didn’t earn much, so I used to go to the office cafeteria for tea—always alone. A week passed, and slowly I started recognizing people. One day, when I went to the cafeteria, I noticed a small group of six people who had come for coffee. I knew they weren’t from my floor—probably from another department.

That’s when I saw him. My Giriettan.

I usually fall for gym rats, but this time it felt different. In my head, the background music of Om Shanti Oshana started playing the moment he walked in. He was around 5’7”, wheatish-skinned, with a beard and really nice eyes. I’m sure he noticed me too. I panicked because he was with five guys and one girl, so I literally escaped from there and went back to my cabin.

The next day, I went to the cafeteria again, but I left as soon as they arrived. I knew they noticed me leaving when they came in. But you know how it is when you like someone—the fear of facing them.

This went on for a few weeks. Sometimes I focused on my work and barely thought about him.

After a few weeks, I went to the cafeteria and found out that one of the guys from their group was the husband of my teammate. That’s when I realized, okay, they probably know me.

The next day, five of them came to the cafeteria, but he didn’t. I felt bad. But then I reminded myself—I came here to study and work, not to fall in love. So I focused on my responsibilities. A month passed, and I assumed he had moved to another office.

My hostel was near my office, so I used to go back there for lunch. One afternoon, while returning to the office, I saw a group of people walking toward me. And there he was—my Giriettan. Seriously, the butterflies in my stomach went crazy. I kept my face normal and acted calm. They passed me, and I smiled only after they were gone. But I noticed his eyes were still on me.

Somehow, I had a colleague in my hostel. She was the same age as me and the only person I spoke to in the office. But I heard a lot of rumors about her—that she wasn’t a “good girl,” that boys tried to hit on her because they thought she was easily available. I never judged her. I only saw her from my point of view. She was good to me, and that’s all that mattered.

One bad thing I heard from a male colleague was that she had dated a married man.

I was shocked. What? Married? She was so beautiful—every man would look at her. Why would she date a married man? That was the only moment I felt disappointed in her.

Two months into my internship, one day I went to the cafeteria and saw my Giriettan again. After all this time, one woman from their group came and spoke to me. Just basic conversation—my name, where I was from, what I did. Suddenly, I rushed back to my cabin because I was terrible at acting normal around them.

When my second month’s salary got credited, I was in a really bad mood. So I decided to go alone to a rooftop bar near my hostel.

I wore a tank top and jeans. I’m 5’2”, chubby, with long wavy hair and brown skin—and I have a good shape too. I walked to the bar around 7 PM. I could feel many men staring at me, but I just played breakup songs by Rihanna in my headphones and walked in confidently.

I ordered one Budweiser beer and dragon chicken. I smoke too, so I had already bought a Mixpod and lighter. I was sitting alone when I noticed two middle-aged men at the table next to mine. One of them asked me for a lighter. I gave it to them—this happened two or three times. The fifth time, one of them came over and asked:

“Hey girl, if you don’t mind, can you join us?”

I replied, “No thanks. Enik ottakk irikkan aanu ishtam.”

He said, “You’re a Malayali? I thought you were a model or North Indian.”

I said, “No, I’m from here only.”

He tried twice more to convince me, but I stood by my decision. Eventually, they left me alone.

Suddenly, I felt a hand on my shoulder.

“Hey Aishwarya, I’m Anjana—your colleague. We talked yesterday. Why are you sitting alone? Come and join us.”

I didn’t recognize her at first. Then I looked at the table where her friends were sitting. There were five people. One was my hostel colleague. The others were strangers—except one.

MY GIRIETTAN.

I panicked. I was sitting alone in a bar with a beer bottle and a cigarette in front of him.

Aishuuuuu, you messed up.

Is this really the impression I wanted to give him outside the office?

I snapped back to reality and went to sit with them.

I acted normal. Normally, I look like a baddie, so I kept my attitude. I barely spoke. I talked to everyone except him. He was sitting beside me, with Anjana between us. Sometimes he passed me his vape. Occasionally, I noticed his eyes on me. But I didn’t give him any reaction. I mostly looked at my phone and talked to others. Still, the butterflies never stopped.

During the conversation, they asked my age. When I said 23, they were surprised and said I was too young. Out of curiosity, I asked their ages. Anjana was 25—but one age shocked me.

My Giriettan was 31.

I was like, What?! Why God, why me?!

After some time, we decided to leave. They dropped us at our hostel.

The next day at the office, I told my teammate that I had met some people at a bar. He asked who they were. I mentioned my hostel mate Anjana and Giriettan.

He suddenly looked shocked and said, “I wanted to tell you something. Do you know who your roommate dated in this office?”

Yes. It was him—my Giriettan.

He was married. And he had dated my roommate.

My heart broke. Everything went dark. Tears filled my eyes. I went to the washroom and cried.

He was the only person I had ever truly crushed on—and it all went wrong.

From the next day onwards, I started avoiding him completely. I didn’t even look at him. Meanwhile, Anjana became very close to me. She was his best friend.

1qmhy1x,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1qmhy1x/sunflower_theory/,sunflower theory :),"A random meetup, A very fine Sunday noon, after a fresh shower, that day I was at my usual coffee shop wearing just a crimson tee and a blue wide leg jeans, open hairs wearing an amazing headphone so that voice around me cannot interrupt my me time and ordering a barrel aged cold brew, oh man that is just heaven. it was a Sunday ofcourse the tables were too occupied so I was holding a corner at the smoking zone, umm okay so I don't smoke sometimes it jst happens!

So there was a cute smoking out there, the way he was holding that ciggerate bud in his finger and kissing it again to his lips, oh man...too turning on thing, wearing a cerulean blue tee and a black shorts, umm umm I judged him for a while, felt like he was waiting for his coffee. Although can't get off his face as he was too cute...just the two of us in the smoking zone!

So as anyone enters the smoking zone on the right side there are stairs and on the left hand side there is a plank mounted over which the ash trays were placed and he was standing there and i was sitting over the stairs...we both saw each other like an endless eye contact, a little cute giggle at his face while seeing me and the tension between both of us in that zone, no words are being part of it but just eyes.

They say ""eyes, never lie"" his eyes were saying that he too wanted to talk to me and why somewhere i was feeling to have a talk with him, like by anychance or over anything but I don't wanted to sound a creepo!

So the waiter called my name, ""Nandini, we have a table for you."" And I knew i had to leave the smoking zone now though i didnt want to and just wanted to look at him like this but that would be weird.

So i went to my table and accepted it as cute lil crush incident thing, whom I don't know, like i don't know anything about him except how cute he looks and how manly man he looks when he releases the smoke of ciggerate from his lips and holding that bud in his fingers.

But but for a moment i felt, universe heard me, like i was confused...that I was manifesting this so loud or like what?

The waiter served me my coffee but it wasn't a barrel aged cold brew instead of that it was an Iced V60, i asked at the waiter so in the meanwhile he came out of the smoking zone and said something to the waiter holding a glass of cold brew in his hands, then i realised my order was exchanged with his and waiter let him know this and he came to and said me ""Hey, our orders have been exchanged, this is yours.""

Ohh man, his heavy manly voice and that sweet gentle tone, felt some butterflies somewhere in my gut after long but but I can't show that easily.

I said him, ""thank you for the coffee.""

And the waiter came and mentioned that sir, it will take still more time to get a vacant table, i heard it and without any second thought, i asked him, ""would you like to join me? Although I am sitting alone, only...if you don't mind.""

""Vinay, this side. I saw you at the smoking zone"" he spoke so softly and sat just opposite to me over the table and he also mentioned that he did notice me, though I knew this but I liked it as he said, you know that cute giggles.

And I said ""oh yes, actually i was thinking that i don't know you, so you came here for first like or what?""

He mentioned, ""your brain wasn't thinking too much, an overthinker, I see""he paused and said ""yeah I don't live in Ahmedabad, i jst come here for coffee whenever I am here.""

And thats how we did a good chit chat in which he told me his basic details that he lives in Vadodara, comes often to ahemdabad, a chef, a barista, a writer and ofcourse a cute manly man who talks very gently and sweetly.

And as he was telling me about himself i told about mine that I am a medical student, a coffee enthusiast and a writer too and recently living an adult life in the city as recently moved out of the hostel and now it's been 2 years in the city.

As were having our last sips of coffee, i noticed that he wanted to smoke but he didn't has one so i felt he will leave now, though i didn't want him to leave but something unexpected happened, he asked me, ""how did you come here?"" I replied by cab so he asked me very politely "" would you like me to drop you at home?"" The way he asked it was feeling that he just wanted to hear an affirmative answer and nothing less.

He asked me, ""what time do you have to reach back?"" I felt is he trying to make me stay back longer or what?

I replied, ""I don't have any plans though, but why so?""

And a lil hesitantly, ""being honest, I really liked your vibe and feels like going over a drive with you, if you are comfortable then only?""

I was honestly excited that this is too unexpectedly happening but again I was scared that whenever I had such butterflies, I had suffered emotionally but my instincts were telling me to take a chance and go ahead and that's what I did.

""Okay, let's goo,but I don't have any place in my mind, its on you, take me to any good calm place.""

""As you say, mam""and that's how we went over the with endless conversations, no awkwardness and no silence and we were talking about our OCD regarding keeping wet things over the bed, so i mentioned two days back i was running late so I forgot my bathrobe over the bed and specially called my roommate to keep it better and same with him he also last night forgot his socks and called his younger sister to keep that back in cupboard, a small rapid fire was going on and he asked me ""arijit singh or  atif aslam?"" And i clearly said atif and he was giving me weird glares and ahh those cute laugh and giggles, I was talking about my flaws and then dealbreakers, he was talking about his from shallow to deep talks the conversation was flowing very smoothly and then only he stopped the car and brought me some beautiful flowers, two sunflowers and few white roses wrapped in a black cover, oh man my inner child was happy seeing the bouqet and then i told him about the sunflowers theory, which says that whenever you give anyone the sunflower never give one but always in a pair as in daytime they face towards the sun but in night they face each other symbolizing that don't know about happy situations but in dark they are having each other's back when it's gonna be dark.

I just teasingly asked him that are we calling this drive, a date?

He also teasingly said that, if it is one i would to call it one, we both giggled and reached a very pretty rooftop cafe as we reached some half hour before the sunset so i might feel we would be having a pretty view of a sunset.

I was stepping out of the car but don't know there was some issue with the door so he came to open the door and i giggled and said the universe wanted you to do so and call it a date.

And we went upstairs and reached the cafe.",3,1769344410.0,FictionWriting,2,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1qmhxoj,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1qmhxoj/giriettan/,Giriettan,"Part 1

I joined an IT company for my internship, which lasted six months. Like everyone else, I was excited to see new people in the office. But honestly, my office wasn’t that fun because most of the employees were much older. A few of us were Gen Z, but we were all in different departments.

And that’s where the story begins.

As an intern, I didn’t earn much, so I used to go to the office cafeteria for tea—always alone. A week passed, and slowly I started recognizing people. One day, when I went to the cafeteria, I noticed a small group of six people who had come for coffee. I knew they weren’t from my floor—probably from another department.

That’s when I saw him. My Giriettan.

I usually fall for gym rats, but this time it felt different. In my head, the background music of Om Shanti Oshana started playing the moment he walked in. He was around 5’7”, wheatish-skinned, with a beard and really nice eyes. I’m sure he noticed me too. I panicked because he was with five guys and one girl, so I literally escaped from there and went back to my cabin.

The next day, I went to the cafeteria again, but I left as soon as they arrived. I knew they noticed me leaving when they came in. But you know how it is when you like someone—the fear of facing them.

This went on for a few weeks. Sometimes I focused on my work and barely thought about him.

After a few weeks, I went to the cafeteria and found out that one of the guys from their group was the husband of my teammate. That’s when I realized, okay, they probably know me.

The next day, five of them came to the cafeteria, but he didn’t. I felt bad. But then I reminded myself—I came here to study and work, not to fall in love. So I focused on my responsibilities. A month passed, and I assumed he had moved to another office.

My hostel was near my office, so I used to go back there for lunch. One afternoon, while returning to the office, I saw a group of people walking toward me. And there he was—my Giriettan. Seriously, the butterflies in my stomach went crazy. I kept my face normal and acted calm. They passed me, and I smiled only after they were gone. But I noticed his eyes were still on me.

Somehow, I had a colleague in my hostel. She was the same age as me and the only person I spoke to in the office. But I heard a lot of rumors about her—that she wasn’t a “good girl,” that boys tried to hit on her because they thought she was easily available. I never judged her. I only saw her from my point of view. She was good to me, and that’s all that mattered.

One bad thing I heard from a male colleague was that she had dated a married man.

I was shocked. What? Married? She was so beautiful—every man would look at her. Why would she date a married man? That was the only moment I felt disappointed in her.

Two months into my internship, one day I went to the cafeteria and saw my Giriettan again. After all this time, one woman from their group came and spoke to me. Just basic conversation—my name, where I was from, what I did. Suddenly, I rushed back to my cabin because I was terrible at acting normal around them.

When my second month’s salary got credited, I was in a really bad mood. So I decided to go alone to a rooftop bar near my hostel.

I wore a tank top and jeans. I’m 5’2”, chubby, with long wavy hair and brown skin—and I have a good shape too. I walked to the bar around 7 PM. I could feel many men staring at me, but I just played breakup songs by Rihanna in my headphones and walked in confidently.

I ordered one Budweiser beer and dragon chicken. I smoke too, so I had already bought a Mixpod and lighter. I was sitting alone when I noticed two middle-aged men at the table next to mine. One of them asked me for a lighter. I gave it to them—this happened two or three times. The fifth time, one of them came over and asked:

“Hey girl, if you don’t mind, can you join us?”

I replied, “No thanks. Enik ottakk irikkan aanu ishtam.”

He said, “You’re a Malayali? I thought you were a model or North Indian.”

I said, “No, I’m from here only.”

He tried twice more to convince me, but I stood by my decision. Eventually, they left me alone.

Suddenly, I felt a hand on my shoulder.

“Hey Aishwarya, I’m Anjana—your colleague. We talked yesterday. Why are you sitting alone? Come and join us.”

I didn’t recognize her at first. Then I looked at the table where her friends were sitting. There were five people. One was my hostel colleague. The others were strangers—except one.

MY GIRIETTAN.

I panicked. I was sitting alone in a bar with a beer bottle and a cigarette in front of him.

Aishuuuuu, you messed up.

Is this really the impression I wanted to give him outside the office?

I snapped back to reality and went to sit with them.

I acted normal. Normally, I look like a baddie, so I kept my attitude. I barely spoke. I talked to everyone except him. He was sitting beside me, with Anjana between us. Sometimes he passed me his vape. Occasionally, I noticed his eyes on me. But I didn’t give him any reaction. I mostly looked at my phone and talked to others. Still, the butterflies never stopped.

During the conversation, they asked my age. When I said 23, they were surprised and said I was too young. Out of curiosity, I asked their ages. Anjana was 25—but one age shocked me.

My Giriettan was 31.

I was like, What?! Why God, why me?!

After some time, we decided to leave. They dropped us at our hostel.

The next day at the office, I told my teammate that I had met some people at a bar. He asked who they were. I mentioned my hostel mate Anjana and Giriettan.

He suddenly looked shocked and said, “I wanted to tell you something. Do you know who your roommate dated in this office?”

Yes. It was him—my Giriettan.

He was married. And he had dated my roommate.

My heart broke. Everything went dark. Tears filled my eyes. I went to the washroom and cried.

He was the only person I had ever truly crushed on—and it all went wrong.

From the next day onwards, I started avoiding him completely. I didn’t even look at him. Meanwhile, Anjana became very close to me. She was his best friend.",2,1769344377.0,writers,1,1.0,False

So my husband (m34) & I (f25) were fighting over something trivial last night. He is a hot- head and would break/smash stuff whenever he's angry. It's something he grew up with. Everytime he would just apologize and say he grew up watching his dad act like this. He said it's a bad habit he can't get rid of him. This ""habit"" would affect me financially and emotionally.

So, like I said last night we were arguing about the dishes and he got upset, grabbed my phone which was on the coffee table and smashed it onto the wall. I gasped when I saw it and ran to check if it was still working but it wasn't. The screen was SHATTERED completely. I lashed out at him and told him this was my phone. He quickly started apologizing saying he was so angry he couldn't see anything and reached for the first thing infrknt of it. He begged for forgiveness but I demanded that he pay for a new one and said I will not be speaking to him unless he agrees. He tried to talk to me trying to get me to forget about the whole thing and promised I won't see this behavior again but I refused. He's now saying stuff like ""You act like you don't knkw how I get"" or ""You kept pushing me about the dishes"" etc.

I'm seriously thinking about going to my mom's til my demands are met and hd still says I'm punishing him for something he cannot control.

HOWEVER, its still the same, so i’m thinking it might actually be me, so any ninja experts got any advice please? 😢

today i had very dark stool, i can’t tell if it’s very very dark brown or black, but i’ve never had black stool before so i am not entirely sure how it looks. it wasn’t tarry or sticky, texture/shape was like around 5 or almost 6 on bristol stool chart but the second time i went there was some that sank and kind of had a coffee grounds-like texture i think (but i’ve had this texture before with normal color diarrhea). there was also a black or almost-black speck on one normal brown piece. i read that blueberries can cause dark stool and i ate two blueberry muffins yesterday but i really don’t think there’s enough blueberries in those to cause that amount of dark stool. it was also a kind of dark yellow when i wiped?

Since then I've had a new OLED & now a new Switch 2 console. I transferred over my game saves & Friday decided what the heck I should probably finished Brilliant Diamond. I gave up just outside Sunnyshore & the last Gym. I loaded into my game Friday & only had time for a few hours in the morning & a quick couple of battles in what I consider the evening. All of it was fought in daylight. 

This morning I woke with a terrible migraine at 3am. So after a cup of coffee, pills & a granola bar I loaded into my game to find it still sunny in game. At about 4am.

I looked up the Day Night time cycle 

Morning 🌅 |     4am - 9:59am
Day 🏞️  |            10am - 7:59pm
Night 🌃 |           8pm - 3:49am

I must have just missed night turning into day at 4am. At least, I hope I did. I remember the game having a golden hue & I thought that was twilight & morning but I may be wrong. So I took some screenshots of my current game & started a new save on my other profile. It's this what morning looks like in game? The sky a dusty powder blue? If so what time of day is the golden hour I'm thinking of? 

My real concern is my save is somehow busted because it moved from multiple consoles & the whole Gamefreak ties your saves to the console & internet time so tightly in this game I'm now stuck in forever daytimes because my saves crossed time & space.

So can someone please tell me what Morning, Day & Night look like in this game!? I keep looking online but can't find any decent articles that actually show the differences between Morning & Day. I took the Morning image here in my new game save an hour ago. I find the other 2 images on Google. But I can't tell what is Morning & what is Day. If I didn't know from Adam I would think the gold sky is Morning, blue sky is Day, the dark sky is Night. But apparently I'm just stupid.

I hadn’t dated anyone for about three years after a very hard breakup, so I was extremely anxious about meeting someone again. I was scared, but eventually I went on the date.

I liked him quite a lot, but early on I felt that the interest wasn’t really mutual. For example, on the first date (just a coffee and a croissant), he didn’t pay, and he often replied very late to messages. Still, I kept seeing him.

We went on two more dates. On the third one, I went to his place and we had sex. At the time, the dynamic of the relationship revolved a lot around physical intimacy, and after that I only saw him at his place. We met two more times, always at his home, and always had s ex. Looking back, it was more of a hookup than dating.

An important detail is that before we ever had sex, he clearly told me he didn’t want a relationship, and I said that was okay for me. On his Hinge profile, he also stated that he wasn’t looking for a relationship.

At that time, I was still a virgin for personal reasons, and I had my first sexual experience with him. I told him it wasn’t a big deal and that he shouldn’t attach too much meaning to it (it kinda didn't have, I wanted to get rid of it and was very h orny, but still it affects me a bit after what happened later, like I don't regret having done with him because it was nice but I regret that he stopped talking later)

Despite what he said about not wanting anything serious, we did share moments of closeness, tenderness, and presence, which confused me and made me hope for more.

Over time, I noticed that instead of feeling chosen, I was trying to prove my worth. He didn’t invest, didn’t initiate consistently, and didn’t show much generosity, emotionally or otherwise. Still, I stayed, hoping that if I gave more, he would eventually choose me.

Eventually, he stopped talking to me altogether... he didnt ""ghost"" lets say but he didn't reply to my last message in the conversation, since 2 months, and I didn't try to talk again too.

2 months later later, I saw that he had updated his dating profile saying he was open to a long-term relationship. That hurt deeply. It made me feel rejected, replaceable, and like there was something fundamentally wrong with me. I felt not chosen.

This situation triggered a painful belief I already had inside me: that I am not enough. I started comparing myself to other women and wondering what I did wrong. I am wondering why he didn't me, I was dealing while meeting him, and still dealing, with a big lack of self esteem and I know it, even though I don't show it. I wonder what I did wrong, if I was too much, if I gave too much, if I was too performative? It hurts me because I was really attracted to him.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1qmhnxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Moccamaster/comments/1qmhnxd/is_upgrading_to_a_moccamaster_actually_worth_it/,Is upgrading to a Moccamaster actually worth it if I’m fine with my cheap drip machine?,"I’m currently using a very basic drip coffee maker, an Aroma Boy that cost me around $40. It’s a simple single-stream drip machine. I make one cup a day, about 300 ml, and honestly the coffee is fine. Not amazing, but good enough that I don’t feel unhappy drinking it.

Lately I’ve been thinking about upgrading, mostly because I keep looking at Moccamaster machines, but I’m stuck wondering whether this is a real upgrade or just curiosity getting the better of me.



The Cup-One seems like it should be perfect for my routine since it’s designed for one cup. But at the same time, the actual brew style doesn’t look fundamentally different from what I already use. It’s still a single-stream drip, just with better temperature control and better build quality. At around $230, I’m not sure that translates into a big enough difference in the cup for someone like me.

From what I’ve read, the improvement sounds more like better consistency and a slightly cleaner brew, not a dramatic change in flavor. That’s nice, but I keep asking myself if that’s really worth spending several hundred dollars when I’m not dissatisfied to begin with.

I’ve also been thinking about the KBG Select. New, it’s clearly expensive, but I could get one used for about the same price as a new Cup-One. On paper that sounds like a better deal. The problem is that I still only drink one 300 ml cup a day. Even with the half-pot setting, the KBG feels like a machine designed for more volume than I’ll ever use. I’m curious whether anyone actually uses a KBG almost exclusively for single-cup daily brewing and feels like it makes sense.

There’s also the Bonavita 5-cup in the background. The price is attractive and people seem to like it, but it’s 110V, needs a transformer, and won’t brew less than three cups. For my habits, that already feels like forcing a machine to do something it wasn’t meant to do.



So I keep coming back to the same thought. If I’m already okay with my current coffee, maybe there’s no strong reason to spend $200 to $300 at all. Maybe the smartest move is to just keep using what I have and stop reading gear reviews.

For people who’ve been in a similar situation, especially those who upgraded from very cheap drip machines or use Moccamaster mainly for small brews, did it actually feel worth it? Or did you end up realizing the upgrade wasn’t as meaningful as you expected?

1qmhnoa,https://www.reddit.com/r/kitchenremodel/comments/1qmhnoa/why_is_it_impossible_to_find_window_treatments/,Why is it impossible to find window treatments that are not gray polyester?,"I recently decided to overhaul my small kitchen. It has been a boring white box for three years and I finally painted the cabinets a soft sage green. I have this vision of a warm, cottage vibe that feels welcoming. I am so tired of the modern minimalist look that every big box store pushes. I just want my space to have character.  
  
The problem is finding the finishing touches without spending a fortune. I have been hunting for window treatments that fit this aesthetic. I went to all the usual stores and everything was either heavy blackout material with ugly metal grommets or cheap plastic sheers. I tried thrifting but I only found stained fabrics. I got frustrated and started looking at where boutique shops actually get their inventory. I spent hours comparing photos and spotted some Alibaba lace kitchen curtains that looked identical to a handmade set I saw on pinterest. But the lace was faded gray. I really need something that looks delicate and classic. Has anyone found a reliable source for vintage style linens that are decent quality? I am willing to pay a fair price but I refuse to get ripped off. I just want my kitchen to finally look finished so I can genuinely enjoy my morning coffee in peace.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Salary came in → month ended → account empty.  
But I *never* felt like I was spending that much.

So a few weeks ago, I started tracking **every expense** with **CapMoney** — nothing fancy, just logging coffee, food delivery, subscriptions, random stuff.

What surprised me:

* It wasn’t big purchases draining my money
* It was **$3–$5 things every day**
* Coffee + snacks + delivery = 💀 by the end of the month

Seeing everything in one place honestly changed how I spend.  
Not in a “stop enjoying life” way — just more *aware*.

I didn’t magically save thousands, but:

* I stopped wondering *where my money went*
* I finally feel in control instead of guessing

If you’re in that “I earn but I’m still broke” phase, tracking alone might help more than budgeting spreadsheets.

Not financial advice — just sharing what worked for me.",1,1769343221.0,buildinpublic,1,0.67,False
