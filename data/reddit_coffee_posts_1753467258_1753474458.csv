In April 2025, I found out I was pregnant—with a due date of December 25th. At the same time, my husband and I were launching our own coffee business. Because of this transition, I was unemployed and uninsured.

As soon as I found out I was pregnant, I began trying to get health insurance. That’s when I hit a wall: pregnancy is not considered a qualifying life event that allows you to enroll in insurance outside of the open enrollment period. Neither is becoming self-employed.

As a new business owner, I cannot get coverage until open enrollment in October, and even then, the policy wouldn’t take effect until January 1st—after my baby is due and after all my prenatal appointments. The birth of a child does qualify you for coverage, but only going forward—it won't cover any part of the pregnancy or the delivery itself.

My doctor warned me that if there are any complications, the cost of giving birth without insurance could be anywhere from $100,000 to $500,000.

I’ve reached out to insurance brokers, the Idaho Health Exchange, and Medicaid. Their advice? “Try Medicaid.” I did. I was denied—because I made just barely too much to qualify. At every step, I’ve been met with cold, bureaucratic indifference. “This is just how it is.”

This is not just how it has to be.
I’m not writing this for sympathy. I’m writing this for change.

I’ve sent letters to our state legislators, senators, and representatives. I’m asking that:

Pregnancy and small business ownership be recognized as qualifying life events for insurance.
Open enrollment happen twice a year with two possible start dates for coverage.
I know I’m not alone. I know couples who are delaying marriage because getting married would make one partner lose coverage. I even know a couple who divorced—despite loving each other deeply—just to qualify for Medicaid.

This is my first child. What should be one of the happiest times of my life has been clouded by stress, anxiety, and fear. I am now being forced to consider leaving Idaho—or even the country—for more affordable maternity care.

My husband is a Marine veteran. But because his disability rating isn’t high enough, I don’t qualify for care through the VA—even though his health issues stem from his service.

We deserve better. All of us.

1m99h43,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidepressants/comments/1m99h43/i_dont_feel_interest_in_anything/,I don’t feel interest in anything,"CW-Suicidal Ideation 

I just can’t get into any of my favorite hobbies. Mainly gaming. Now you might say “do something else” and I have. I have art to do-digital and traditional, write, and binge watch tv. But… I can’t get into any new series to watch even though they meet my interests, or new games. It’s so damn frustration and disheartening. I force myself to get that old feeling of enjoyment and excitement by using (as prescribed) my Adderall and ridiculously high amounts of caffeine that concerns me. I’m on the max dosage of adderall and I’m drinking the equivalent of 600mg of coffee, caffeinated diet sodas, or energy drinks. This isn’t the life I wanted for myself. It’s not healthy or safe to need that in order to enjoy being alive. If I don’t do that , I have no drive to do anything  and I just want to sleep even when there’s so many things I want to do. 
I can only think back when this started and this downward spiral started when I began Abilify for my mild OCD. I wanted my dr to get me off of it but my Dr wanted to get me off Effexor because it was making me want to bite the big one. She’s extra cautious and doesn’t want me to dump off of a bunch of medications at once, which is great since that’s a GOOD doctor is supposed to do. But instead of being suicidal I’m just frustrated that I can’t enjoy anything. I feel a little more motivated since I got off of the 
Effexor but still I don’t feel the way I once was.
I doubt it’s helpful since everyone’s body acts differently to medications but I’m also on Lexapro and Wellbutrin. Did anyone else have the issue of not feeling focused, motivated, or straight up bored to the point of falling asleep on any of these medications? Or had these issues at all?

1m99ggs,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1m99ggs/why_is_the_aeropress_go_the_ultimate_portable/,Why is the AeroPress Go the ultimate portable coffee maker review?,"Trying a new coffee maker becomes an exciting prospect, especially when it promises versatility and convenience. I recently put the **AeroPress 15A01 Go Travel Coffee Press Kit** to the test, using it in diverse settings and routines. This portable coffee maker comes with the bold claim of being a 3-in-1 brew method that combines elements of a French Press, pour-over, and espresso brewer. Its compact nature intrigued me, particularly for someone who often finds themselves brewing coffee during travels, camping trips, and even in the office.

**Design And Portability Fit For Travelers**  
The first thing I noticed about this coffee maker was its sleek and compact design. It's slightly smaller than its predecessor, the AeroPress Original, yet comes with a portable twist—literally. The included mug and lid double as a traveling case, which means there’s no need to carry additional baggies or fancy coffee accessories. Weighing only 11.2 ounces, I barely felt its weight in my backpack during a recent hiking trip. The matte finish and robust build assure me it can handle a bit of outdoor roughness.

**Ease of Use And Brewing Time**  
Using it for the first time, I was relieved at how simple the operation is: add coffee, water, stir, and press. Seriously, you don’t need to be a skilled barista to work this gadget. In under a minute, I had an 8oz cup of smooth coffee. There’s an option to brew one to three espresso-style shots as well. If you like experimenting, it even delivers cold brew in just two minutes—a fun feature for hotter days. All it took was cold water and a minor tweak to the grind size to craft an indulgent cold brew.  

[Think AeroPress 15A01 Go is for you? Check it out on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b07yvl8sf3/)

**Highlights**  
The experience of brewing with this coffee maker took me by surprise in the best way possible. Here are a few key upsides:  
- Smart and compact design perfect for backpacking, camping, or work travel.  
- Delivers smooth coffee without the grit or bitterness common in French Press brewing.  
- Brew options for espresso-style coffee, cold brew, or regular cups—all within minutes.  

**Adverse Aspects**  
Of course, not every product is without its quirks, and this coffee maker is no exception. Here’s what might bug you:  
- The process involves using paper filters, which means purchasing replacements regularly.  
- Producing only small batches might not suffice for large families or coffee groups.  
- Cleaning, while easier than some contraptions, requires attention to the plunger mechanism.

**Brewing Flexibility Gives You Control**  
Adjusting the coffee grind size, the water-to-coffee ratio, and brewing time allows for crafting your perfect cup manually. This flexibility is something I’ve had fun experimenting with nearly every day. Medium-fine grind works well, but I’ve shifted coarser for cold brew. My picky coworker even found their latte base delightful when we brewed together.

**Market Rivals Worth Comparing**  
There are other portable coffee makers on the market, such as the Wacaco Minipresso or the Timemore Nano French Press. However, the AeroPress Go shines in its all-in-one brewing versatility and weightless portability that its competitors can’t fully replicate. While some alternatives have sleeker designs or produce single-serve espresso shots with more pressure, they often lack the multi-brewing methods this gem boasts in one compact kit.

**Affordable Quality**  
In terms of cost-efficiency, this coffee maker strikes a sweet spot for travelers and coffee enthusiasts alike. While pricing fluctuates, what stands out is the incredible value offered by its versatility and durability. The lack of additional plugs or power dependency makes it perfect for remote outdoor adventures or minimalist setups, delivering coffee-shop quality at a fraction of long-term costs.

Until this morning, my grandfather passed away. It was very unexpected. He was getting his morning coffee and he collapsed. The doctor said he was gone before he hit the floor. Sudden cardiac arrest. 

And what’s strange is yesterday I was feeling very panicked, I was unsure why. I had nothing to panic about. I called out of work this morning because I was still up in a panic and hadn’t slept much. 

My mother called me at 9:30 this morning, and I don’t wish that phone call on anyone. I’ve never heard my mother in such hysterics. I left the house so fast. I got to the hospital and the doctor was just leaving the “compassion room” after breaking the news to my family. 

I just couldn’t look at him, we went into the room with him, and I just couldn’t look at him. I’ve never seen a dead person before, i couldn’t comprehend it. I thought he was just going to wake up and be alright. I hugged him, said my goodbyes and sobbed. 

This is a new experience for me, and I’m not sure what to do. I’ve got my girlfriend as my support who has, unfortunately, experience more death than a single person should ever. She’s helping me navigate these feelings. Anyway, before this turns into my therapy journal I’ll end here.

I've done those before and didnt really see much results). I did inform my mother, but she freaked out at me, saying that I shouldn't be fasting at all. So, I need some more research recommendations and tips & pointers.

What I know so far:
- maintain electrolyte intake
- don't go overboard with exercise, but exercise lightly to maintain muscle mass (to whatever degree). Don't not exercise so you don't lose muscle
- break your fast with a well balanced meal once you feel hungry during the fast

So what other information would be helpful? Any research resources would be helpful, too. All I was finding with searches were tips for intermittent fasting.

And I do have more specific questions, for the experienced and knowledgeable: 

- is it okay to have coffee while fasting? I drink it black, for reference

The hardest part for me wasn’t pain. It was the mental grind of sitting all day every day. The first two weeks felt endless. No movement. No momentum. Just a lot of time with your thoughts. But I knew in the back of my mind this was the most important time of my recovery. So I was extremely disciplined with ice, elevation, and drinking at least a gallon of water a day.

I was in a soft cast for the first two weeks and then transitioned to the VACOped boot. Life felt back. Life gets a lot easier when you get in a boot. I’ve now been in the boot for two weeks and have begun increasing the range of motion as allowed by the boot, from 30 to 25 and now 30 to 20 degrees today.

If I could give any recommendation, it would be to start PT as soon as you can. I know a lot of people don’t start until week six. I started week three with simple stuff like dorsiflexion, moving my foot up and down, toe yoga, ankle circles. The first time I tried this, it felt impossible.

Now, two weeks into PT, I feel it all coming back. I can do the alphabet A to Z with my foot. I can do full circles with my ankle in both directions. I can almost get my foot to neutral. My big toe is the only thing still taking some time to get that bend down grip back, so I’m working on that now.

I’m not special. I didn’t do anything fancy. I drank a gallon of water a day. Elevated religiously. Iced often, even when I didn’t think I needed it. Added a scoop of collagen to my morning coffee and took vitamin C for absorption. I also kept my diet clean. Your body needs that fuel to heal.

So for anyone just starting or a couple weeks in, stay consistent. The progress will come. It’s slow at first, but once you get in the boot, life gets a whole lot easier.

As I’ve been telling myself, life is long. This is temporary. We’re all in this together.

IN ALL SERIOUSNESS THIS MAY BE A BIT TRIGGERING SO PLEASE FEEL FREE TO TAKE A BREAK AND TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF

Nestled in a quiet forest clearing on the edge of town, Vienna’s cozy office feels more like a sanctuary than a clinic. Soft light filters through frosted windows, tea is always steeping, and there’s always a thick knit blanket waiting for clients. She specializes in helping people process what they can’t always say; grief, guilt, identity, emotional scars.

Vienna rarely raises her voice, often speaking in slow, reassuring tones. Though shy and easily flustered, her intuition is strong, and she always seems to know the right questions to ask; even if she sometimes hesitates before speaking.

You step into the softly lit therapy office. Rain taps gently at the window. Vienna glances up from her notepad, brushing her hair behind one antler, then gestures silently to the couch across from her desk.

“Take your time…we don’t have to start until you’re ready,” she murmurs. “But when you are…what brings you here today?”

1m9955x,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m9955x/the_mimics_take_manhattan/,The Mimics take Manhattan,"*Author’s note: This is a story based on hunter’s idea of a Mimic/Skinwalker set within a city. Although I’m not massively familiar with this medium I thought it would be a fun idea. There’s a couple references to creepcast bits and the boys respective channels so see if you can spot them all! (This is part one of a series) - J Leonard.*

**Last year, Manhattan went quiet.**

For six weeks, no one was allowed in or out. You didn’t know that, of course. If the government doesn’t want you to know something, they’ll make sure you don’t.

I only know because I was one of the few still trapped inside when it began.

It didn’t happen all at once just little by little, things began to change.

First, the number of patients entering psychiatric wards spiked. Addicts relapsed after experiencing what they believed to be worsening withdrawal symptoms  

Before a single drop of blood was spilled, you could feel the violence in the air. Even if you hadn’t personally experienced an intrusion, you knew someone who had.

There was something creeping in.  Following two steps behind you.  Sliding through open windows and lurking in dark corners.

Then the U.S. military came in and set up blockades.  No one in or out.  If you tried to cross, you’d be met with swift death. They seemingly knew what they were dealing with.

We, of course, didn’t.

Finally, there was violence. Riots in the streets soon overwhelmed the dwindling police force. Paranoia set in, and people began to turn on each other. All anyone knew was that there was some force, some group of creatures that looked human and they were dangerous enough to keep us from leaving.

Fights broke out. Gunshots rang through the night. 

And the screaming.

Jesus, the screaming.  It was constant. Roughly every half hour, there were cries for help, wails of pain, or just general hysteria.

It went on like that for about a week or so.  I myself had done what I always do during election nights.  Barricaded myself in my room, raided the local bodega for as much canned food as I could carry, and smoked so much weed I left myself in a numbing fugue state.

It was in one of these fugue states that I was awoken by an alert on the TV.

**“UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT ADDRESS - CC23”** “US MILITARY HAS CONFIRMED PRESENCE OF INTERPLANAR BEINGS WITHIN THE MANHATTAN AREA.” “PLEASE REMAIN CALM AND MAKE PASSAGE TO CHECKPOINT 4.”

Alongside the text was an ancient map of Manhattan, couldn’t have been made any later than the 80s. In fact, the entire message looked about forty years out of date. 

There was a white dot on the Henry Hudson Bridge, and X’s on every other tram, railway, or bridge leading out of Manhattan.

“- ENSURE TRAVEL IS ON FOOT. STAY OUT OF VEHICLES AND CONFINED SPACES.- TRAVEL IN GROUPS OF FOUR OR FIVE COMPRISED OF MEMBERS YOU CAN TRUST.- DO NOT ALLOW ANY NEW MEMBERS TO YOUR GROUP. PACK LIGHT BUT SMART, WITH...”

The message then continued with a lengthy list of survival gear and weaponry to pack, running for about 90 seconds before continuing:

“COUNT. HUMANS HAVE 32 TEETH. MOST INTERPLANAR BEINGS DO NOT. REMEMBER: KEEP TRACK OF EYE COLOUR OR NOTICEABLE BODILY FEATURES.  STAY CALM, TRAVEL SAFE, BE AWARE, TRUST WHAT YOU KNOW NOT JUST WHAT YOU CAN SEE — AND GOD BLESS AMERICA.”

The message began to repeat.

I got up. At the time, I was living in the Financial District,  about as southern as you can get in Manhattan, and the Henry Hudson Bridge was just about as far north as you can go before practically being in Yonkers. At minimum, the trip would take five hours. But that’s easier said than done.

I couldn’t just trace the outline of Manhattan. The blockade guards seemed particularly trigger-happy. I’d need to go through the city. That added about an hour. If I where to weave through, avoiding dense areas, it’d still take seven hours. Minimum.

Then the realisation hit me. How many people did I actually know in the apartment block. The landlord. The neighbour to the left of me who blasted 2010s rap late into the night. That was it. I hadn’t even *seen* the others, let alone known them well enough to take a faux pilgrimage with.

As that realization dawned on me of how long it would take, and whether I could do it alone I heard a knock at the door.

“Hey! Anyone in there?” a female voice called out.

I froze.

Another knock.

“Hello? We’re making the trip to the bridge and wanna form a group.”

I slowly walked to the door and looked through the peephole.

On the other side was a woman, maybe mid-20s. She nervously stroked her long, jet-black hair that partially covered a *Siouxsie and the Banshees* T-shirt, tucked into baggy cargo pants held up by a worn leather belt that kept a large hunting knife against her hip.

She opened her mouth to speak, then looked down, noticing the shadow I cast under the door.

“Hey! I know someone’s in there! We’re not one of those things, okay?”

“Who the fuck is *we*?” I called back. “And how do I know you’re not lying?”

She sighed.

“I’m Jacobi. I live in 7A. This is…” she trailed off, glancing to her left.

“Kyle! I found someone, get over here!” she whispered hurriedly.

“Oh shit,” a muffled voice replied, stumbling into view.

A clearly middle-aged man, neck adorned with a mess of tattoos fading into his pale skin, framed by a bouquet of ratty dreads. He wore large sunglasses and reeked of too many clashing body sprays.

“Wassup. I’m Kyle. You can call me K-Dawg though. I’m thirty, I make music, I DJ, I do tattoos and piercings. What can I say, I’m just trying to make my way through life and this beautiful city we call Nueva York.”

Both Jacoby and I stood in silence.

“Okay. Show me your teeth. I need to see thirty-two.”

“Fine,” Jacobi responded.

Both of them took turns showing their open mouths to the peephole. Both with 32.

To be honest, I felt awful asking. Sure, I was being careful but these were just people, trying to get by.

“Alright, well… if you’re coming with us, open the door and show us yours.”

I hesitated a moment before unlatching the door and opening it, mouth agape.

“Look at that! Thirty-two. I knew I could trust you…” Kyle paused, realising he didn’t know my name.

“Charlie. My name’s Charlie.”

“For sure, Chuck. Can I call you Chuck?”

“No.”

Jacobi cut in, “Charlie, have you heard anything about what’s going on beyond the message?”

“Not really. I’ve seen some of the riots, but aside from that and a few rumours, I’ve got no clue.”

“Shit. Neither have we,” she muttered, looking surly.

Another awkward silence lingered.

Jacobi broke it, “We’ve got a group of four. So we’ve got space for a fifth — if you’d like to join?”

I agreed.

She introduced me to their third, Marge, a middle-aged woman in a tattered fast food uniform and Gregory, a gaunt young man who Kyle had run into earlier in the building.

We planned our route, including a stop at Gregory’s Grandfather’s apartment, then packed our bags and swapped gear to lighten our respective loads.

“Did any of you know anyone else in the building who’s worth checking in on?” Marge asked during a lull.

“Nah, not really,” Jacobi replied. “There’s an old guy in 10A, but I didn’t hear anything when I knocked earlier.”

“Yeah, I know who you mean,” Marge said. “I don’t think I ever saw him leave his apartment. Even before all this.”

She paused. “Does anyone have any batteries? I’ve got a flashlight but nothing to power it.”

“Yeah, I might,” Kyle replied. “Gonna be honest, though  I have no idea where they are. Could use some help looking.” He tilted his head toward Marge, who responded with a blank stare.

“I can help,” I said. Might as well get comfortable with Kyle, since we’d be stuck together for the long haul.

I followed Kyle to his apartment through his scarcely furnished living room, which was adorned with posters of *The Dark Knight* and empty bottles of body spray, until we arrived at his bedroom, where he pulled out a large storage box from under his unmade bed.

“They've gotta be in here somewhere,” he said, rummaging through the box’s junk.

As he did, I silently scanned his room, noticing a small picture frame on the dresser beside me. It was of a teenage Kyle by a large lake. On either side of him were two other teenagers; a girl with orange hair and a boy with a small, forced smile.

As I looked at the photo, I thought back to the warning: **“KEEP TRACK OF EYE COLOUR.”** Of course, I didn’t know Kyle until moments ago, but this photo would be a useful reference point just in case.

“Kyle?”

“Yeah?” he responded, still digging through the box’s litter.

“What colour are your eyes?”

He stopped searching.

“Why?”

“It’s just... you’ve had those sunglasses on this whole time. I Wanted to know for future reference. Could you take them off and show me?”

“Nah, man.” He got up, now sweating slightly.

“Why not? I trust you and all  I just wanna see for my own sake.”

“Well, if you trust me, you don’t need to see them. Alright?” Kyle snapped back, now stepping closer to me.

“Come on, don’t be like that, just show me. I wanna be careful.”

“Don’t tell me how I should fucking be, Chuck,” he said, closing the distance between us. He was now soaking wet with sweat.

“Just lea-” he said before I cut him off, my hand mindlessly smacking his face and knocking his sunglasses off, revealing two blue eyes.

In the photo, both eyes were brown.

Kyle reeled back from the slap.

“What the fuck was that…” He looked at me, then down to the photo. “Oh.” His eyes snapped back up to me.

“I’m not one of them! It’s not what it looks like!” he pleaded desperately, moving to the side in an attempt to block my path to the door. I pushed past him but was stopped as he grabbed my arm. Despite his skinny frame, he seemingly had Herculean strength and halted me from moving. As he did, I realized he wasn't secreting sweat at all, but instead a thick, mucus-like substance that covered his body in a strange sheen.

“HELP! FUCKING HELP ME! KYLE’S ONE OF THEM!” I screamed out.

“Don’t s-” he cut himself off with deep, beleaguered, shaky breaths.

“Don’t sa-auuuuu,” his second attempt was once again halted as a deep gurgling ran up and out of his throat, spitting up a thick yellow liquid. He shot me a genuine look of despair.

“LET GO!”

I heard a commotion outside the apartment's entrance. Jacobi called from outside, “THE DOOR LOCKED BEHIND YOU! WE CAN’T GET IN!”

I looked back from the bedroom door to Kyle who was suddenly missing his two front teeth. Then his incisors. Then his molars, each dropping out of his mouth and followed by a thread of pus-like yellow liquid. Quickly, they all fell out until there was nothing left but gum.

I kicked him hard in the stomach, which seemingly pushed more of the pus-liquid out of his throat and into his mouth. He stumbled back and loosened his grip, falling into the dresser.

“CLEAR AWAY FROM THE DOOR! WE’RE GONNA TRY TO BREAK IT DOWN!” Jacobi shouted from behind the closed door.

**BANG.**

As Kyle steadied himself, I made a break for the front door. In my brief dash for the apartment entrance, I could hear him already chasing behind me, his thundering footsteps pounding heavily just inches away until the chase ended. The weight of his body, far heavier than a man of his stature should be, slammed into me, knocking me to the floor. His body pressed mine deep into the carpet that clearly hadn’t been cleaned in months.

**BANG.**

I felt his hot, hurried breath panting against the back of my neck.

“Tell them the truth. Tell them I’m not one of those fucking things, man!” Kyle whispered. What was strange, more than the Lovecraftian beings and slightly less than having a white guy with dreadlocks and no teeth pin me down in his living room,  was that despite the aforementioned lack of teeth, he had no difficulty enunciating and spoke perfectly. With one major exception: his voice, for a reason that would soon become clear, sounded muffled, as if covered by something.

“Ok, s-sure man, I’ll tell them just get off me, okay?” I replied, obviously lying.

“I don’t belie- ” he began to say before he was cut off by a…

**BANG.**

Jacobi busted through the door, Gregory coming in shortly behind her. With an ear-bleedingly loud scream that can only be likened to a battle cry, she pounced onto Kyle, pulling him off me and latching onto his back. As the pair stumbled through the living room, Jacobi repeatedly stabbed her large hunting knife into Kyle's body, slashing and tearing away at his now-pulsating back and arms.

I found myself unable to move. Slapping Kyle was already a stupid enough decision, and the fight between Jacobi and him was the first time I had seen wounds that deep. Or violence that real. Whether you want to call it survival instinct or just plain terror, I froze, staring unblinkingly at Kyle and Jacobi.

The brawl escalated both now covered in a mix of Kyle’s blood and yellow pus. Kyle lurched his body hard, sending Jacoby flying off his back and into the room’s central coffee table, knocking her unconscious. Kyle billowed over, his body shuddering. The muscles along his arms and legs at first seemed to contract and tense, but I soon realized they weren’t there was something, along each bicep and tendon, undulating beneath his skin.

Before I could get a better look, I was yanked away by Gregory, who pulled me up out of the room.

“Come on, Charlie, we gotta get out of here,” he hurriedly spat as we found ourselves back in the hallway.

“What about Jacobi?” I responded.

“Fuck Jacobi. We gotta leave,” Gregory snapped, slamming the door shut, but was stopped by something wedged between the door and the frame.

A hand. Or at least what used to be a hand. The palm and body of it were still the same, but the fingers' skin had been pulled back, wrinkling in front of the knuckles with sharp, broken finger bones acting as faux claws, sprouting from each fleshy nub.

“Tell them. Tell them. Tell them,” Kyle repeated, his muffled voice barely audible through the door’s open wedge.

“JESUS CHRIST, GIMME A FUCKING HAND HERE!” Gregory screamed.

I leapt to the door, attempting to push back against Kyle as Margaret watched, tears streaming down her cheeks. Our fight was futile with a single bash, Kyle slammed the door open.

His eyes were set on me once again, and he pounced, pinning me to the hallway’s carpet. It was at that moment I was able to truly see his new monstrous form.

Both his arms, now pinning my shoulders to the ground, were far larger. Covered with giant, pulsating muscle that tore through his skin, revealing raw pink tissue and splitting the many tattoos that adorned the two limbs. His legs, however, had no new muscle but instead buckled outward, forcing him to become bow-legged.

His face was even more alien. His eyes were now completely blank and void of emotion. His toothless, gaping mouth slowly oozed a mixture of blood and the unfortunately familiar yellow liquid onto my face. As I peered deeper into his mouth, I noticed something. The back of his throat was now growing gradually pushing forward, inflating into a strange red flesh balloon that quickly filled his mouth and protruded outwards beyond his lips. At its peak was a small slit that opened slowly to reveal something far more solid, yellowed teeth. The balloon slowly retreated back into Kyle's old mouth, clinging to the newly permeated jaw, peeling down it like a tight sock being taken off an obese man’s calf.

Until finally, a wolf-like muzzle, with dozens of jagged crocodilian teeth scattered across it, was revealed. It’s size was just large enough to keep Kyle’s original mouth from closing.

Gregory and Margaret began slowly backing away.

He opened his mouth with a slow, wet separation. “Tell them the tr- ”

**BANG.** The right half of his forehead blasted away. Then the left. Leaving a bubbling crater of gore where the top half of his head should be.

As the gunshot rang through my ears, and the blood from Kyle’s stump squirted into my eyes, I managed to make out Gregory and Margaret dropping to their knees with their hands behind their heads, showing their teeth. I whipped my head toward Kyle’s open front door, where Jacobi caked in a mixture of Kyle’s and her own blood  stumbled through.

Looking behind me, she dropped her knife and fell to her knees.

I felt a large hand pull me out from under Kyle by the collar. I wiped my eyes clean of blood and saw a pot-bellied, broad-shouldered old man standing just in front of the now-open door to apartment 10A. My hearing slowly cleared out just in time to hear:

“God dammit. Show me your teeth, boy,” the mysterious older man said with a thick Southern drawl, pointing a large hunting rifle at me.

I complied.

“Alright, everyone get up,” he said, putting the safety back on his rifle and swinging it over his shoulder. He shot a look at me before continuing. “Friend of yours?”

“N-no. I just met him he’s one of our neighbours,” I replied.

He furrowed his brow. “How’d you know he was one of them?”

“He had an old photo in his bedroom. His eyes were a different colour in it.”

“Smart. Good idea, kid. Alright, neighbours IDs, passports, whatevers let’s see ’em,” he barked, not too dissimilar from a drill sergeant.

Everyone searched our respective pockets and backpacks for any kind of identification that would satisfy the old man. Everyone except Jacobi, who glared with defiance at the old man and said, “You first, *neighbour*.”

The old man shrugged and pulled out a veteran ID, revealing his name: **Ernest Hancock**. Jacoby begrudgingly began searching for an ID of her own.

After verifying everyone’s identifications, Jacoby and I returned to our respective apartments to clear as much viscera as we could in the little time we had.

Now back in the hallway, we regrouped with the others and explained our route to Ernest. Considering we were down a member, it wouldn’t hurt to have an extra set of hands especially one with a little firepower.

He exhaled while intensely examining our intended route, occasionally muttering disapprovingly.

“Listen, Ernest  if you don’t like the route, don’t come. We’ve already got four people,” Gregory said, cutting through the silence.

“No, no, it’s alright. Going through Central Park is a smart idea. Open spaces, plenty of room,” Ernest said. “This is your problem,” he continued, pointing at various points on the map I had added. “You’re correct in wanting to avoid these populated areas, but there’s a pretty big issue with this route. Everyone else will be avoiding these areas. If they’re New York natives, they’ll probably be going the same places we will. Which means more people which could mean more of *them*,” he gestured to Kyle’s corpse.

“Well, there’s no real other option, is there? It’s not like we can just take the subway,” Gregory said.

Ernest shrugged his shoulders.

“Well…” he said, trailing off.

“No. Fuck that. No, absolutely not,” Gregory barked back.

“They’ve been shut down for weeks now, and I doubt anyone else plans to do the same,” Ernest said calmly, with the tone of a parent assuring their child.

Jacoby chimed in, “I have to agree with Ernest. I mean, who else is gonna be down there? It’s only two ways — so if we get cornered, we just bolt the other direction.”

“Thank you, sweetheart,” Ernest said, politely nodding to Jacoby, who responded with a glare that could burn through steel.

“I didn’t- I, uh- it’s-” Ernest winced.

“Y-yeah, I agree too,” I said. I still couldn’t tell you if I actually did agree. I think I would’ve gone with whatever plan didn’t leave me alone with one of the mimics again.

“How do we know it’s not crawling with those things?” Gregory cut in.

“We don’t. But we know that there’s plenty up here,” Ernest shot back.

“Fine! By all means, fucking go for it. I’m outta here. No way in hell am I going into the subway,” Gregory shouted, grabbing his bag and beginning to march away from the group.

“Whatever you say, Greg. Good luck out there on your own! I’m sure you’ll be a-okay.  No weapons, no map, no people,” Ernest called out, dripping with sarcasm.

Gregory stopped and clenched his fists, muttering expletives under his breath.

“Fuck it. Let’s just get out of here,” Gregory shouted.

As we began to make our way to the nearest station, I fell back from the rest of the group, attempting to walk with Jacoby, who had begun to trail behind. Her demeanour was somewhat cold. I attempted to strike up a conversation.

“Hey, thanks for coming in there back then. I would’ve been a goner if it wasn’t for you.”

She gave a polite smile. “It’s all good. To be honest, once Gregory had knocked the door down, I blinked and I was on Kyle’s back.”

“Really? You were crazy in there! Screaming and fucking tearing away. You were like an animal. In a good way, I mean. A cool good animal,” I replied.

“Thanks. I think?” she said, now with a smaller but more genuine grin.

“Any time… Did you hear what Kyle had said before you came in?” I asked. What he was repeating had truly been weighing on my mind, but I made an effort to hide my worry as I asked.

“No, not really. What was he saying?” she asked, concerned.

“He was trying to convince me he wasn’t one of those things. The strange part was... I think he really believed it. Obviously that was before he lost his mind. I think there was a part of him that didn’t want it to be true.”

“Shit, really?”

“Maybe he was just lying, trying to trick you guys into not coming in. But... I dunno. What if he really didn’t know he was one of them?”

“I dunno, that’s- ” Jacoby started before being cut off by Ernest.

“Abandon all hope, ye who enter,” Ernest called out in a jokey ominous tone to the rest of the team.

A fun bit is that technology and polyester clothing and thread actually rust, or unravel, and rot away when outside the bounds of the city. It is Jaskier centric, and involves plotlines about illegal/unethical experiments, attempted assassinations, and a hidden bloodline for our favorite bard.

1m9926f,https://www.reddit.com/r/raypeat/comments/1m9926f/progestrone/,Progestrone,"Hi,

I am posting here to see some guidance for those who have tried progesterone. So let me give you some background:

About 2-3 month ago, I noticed that my period became shorter form 28 days to 25-26 days, and also last month, it was evident that i didn't ovulate (i blame this on immense work stress and other life stuff) - my period was horrific with all the PMS symptoms (i usually never have PMS - due to many lifestyle factors) - about a week before my period, I couldnt sleep, sleep anxiety built up, etc etc....(i have history of trauma related of my postpartum period and how i couldn't sleep for weeks' end). Anyhow, long story short,  i consulted my naturopath and he said it appears that i am low on progesterone (well that makes sense) so he got me on progesterone (bioidentical) - from a compounding pharmacy. Its little square pills (troches) mixed in an oil. I was suppose to take small amounts (first half of my cycle) and double the dose in the later half of my cycle. 

  
As far as my lifestyle - I enjoy working out (little cardio and some resistance training 3-4 times a week along with Sauna). I eat mostly home cooked food - very clean. I dont eat red meat (so i try other source of protein - chicken and eggs). No alcohol. I am going to start black coffee - I don't really drink much.

  
Some things i noticed earlier after starting progesterone - When I took the big dose of 50 all that once, I felt physical symptoms of anxiety - my naturopath didn't tell me to take it in small doses (i came to learn about it from Ray peats articles). I would spend all day recovering from that ""panic"". With the ebbs and flows of anxiety in the first part of my cycle this month - i noticed increase in libido, CM, desire to have more kids (lol) and ovulation pain. Now that I am in the second part of my cycle, and after reading Peats articles, I am micro dosing my progesterone - taking a small portion about \~8-10 mg and taking it multiple times a day (4-5 timeish). Good news - no more adrenaline spikes and my glucose is stable per my CGM. Mood is stable, calm, very less anxiety. 

BUT---my sleep is kind of a mystery right now. I have a very structured bedtime routine (sleep and wake at the same time) - no screens, all the right things. I have been taking progesterone 10-20mg before bed time. I go to bed at 10ish, and i start to feel sleepy \~30-45 mins but then i don't fall asleep - i either get anxious or get super hot and it feels like my stress level increases (and I saw this on my glucose monitor too - my sugar crashed and it took about an hour after (i took another 10 mg of progesterone) to calm down and fall asleep. I also drank a glass of milk with chocolate powder before bed yesterday to help with this. but no - same thing. This is my daily routine - 2-3 hours before i can actually fall asleep.

My thyroid appears to be ok, I checked my temps after eating. I dont have any bowel movement problems (regular and daily).I take b12 with nutritional yeast, magnesium glycinate (occasionally) and vitamin d one of twice a week.

so question - how can i better time my progesterone, why is this happening and what else can be done to prevent this re-occuring loop. I often worry about sleep - and this is just making it worse. 

I realize this is not a a HUGE issue - but i would appreciate if someone has an insight. 

thanks in advance.

	•	Where did the money from collections like the Discord server, walk for your sister, and Buy Me a Coffee actually go?

	•	What exactly was reported to the police, and in what capacity? It sounds like Kyle went to a station, asked if there was any proof he’s a creep, and a tired officer just took some notes. That does not sound like a proper investigation.

	•	How is information being managed now, especially after private chats and conversations were leaked in the previous group?

	•	How will this new group handle reports of creepy or unsafe behaviour? Will it hide behind the idea of “inclusivity” again and respond with offers of first aid training during meet-ups?

	•	Why is this being described as a large enterprise or business again instead of simply a meetup?

	•	And Kyle, why are you still pushing this? Is it just about money at this point?",10,1753473069.0,manchester,2,0.92,False

As faint beams of sunlight begin to reach through pale-colored curtains, a stale atmosphere lies thick. The room is dark, the air is warm, the bed is empty. In a natural response to the brightening sky, I rise from restless sleep. Silence is broken with the start of an old coffee machine. Nothing is more lonely than a morning, a cycle that facilitates no reason to believe in change. 

Ice clicks and hisses as a bitter, hot liquid is poured over it. A dry breakfast, cold water to the face. Music plays like a comforting friend whispering encouragement. There are words in the lines that mean nothing but the everything they mean to just one person. *I wish nothing but the best for you.* 

Maybe that person drinks iced coffee in their small apartment filled with loud silence and the memory of Jake drinking an iced Americano by their side, my side.



So much has changed in the past few years. Everyone has changed, but I am stuck in the past. Still the uni dropout, but much more alone. 

I didn’t use to be alone. Honestly, it was a slow process. It started two years ago, when Maya left. It wasn’t an altogether painful experience; I think I was expecting the breakup. She wasn’t happy, and I don’t know how to change. 

Then the rest of my friends slowly became more distant. They got married, and many became reduced to colleagues. All of them but Jake. He never for a second faltered in his unwavering existence. He changed, sure, but never left like everyone else, until he did.



At 8 pm, Mum calls.

“How is that friend of yours? Jake, right?”

Friend is such a curious word. A friend can split the difference between hope and the absence of feeling; in other words, silence. One time, after a run, we sat on the curb in peaceful quiet. He looked at me with unspoken words. I still think about that day.

“Jake moved, Mum, remember? I haven’t seen him in a while, but I am sure he is doing fine. He always is.” He always is now. 

I remember the day. He invited me for coffee, like we always do. He got an iced Americano, like he always does. We chatted about life, work, music, running, everything as normal. Then, he said it so casually.

“Hey, by the way, I think I am going to move.”

The following silence sounded like screams: loud and piercing.

“Oh, okay.” More silence. “Why?”

I never got a real answer out of him.  



Miles away, on the other side of a small world, silence is broken with the start of a brand new coffee machine. Nothing is more lonely than a morning. 

Maybe Jake drinks iced coffee in his cozy apartment filled with loud silence. Maybe he wishes we were back by each other's sides. 

He never told me why he left, but now I think I know. I don’t know what I would’ve said if he had taken the chance. 

I open our old messages. Still just the “thanks x” he left me months ago. I stare at it for a while, then put the phone down.

Maybe it’s my turn to change. Maybe mornings don’t have to be so silent.",1,1753472931.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

1m98ta8,https://www.reddit.com/r/sicily/comments/1m98ta8/the_review_of_the_east_coast_of_sicily_that_no/,The review of the east coast of Sicily that no one asked for,"Sicily has been on our list for quite some time.   We were invited to a wedding, making it the perfect  excuse to take two weeks to visit the Easy Coast of Sicily.  

For context, we are a family of three.  Two adults and one child age nine.

First, we took the new direct Delta flight from JFK to Catania.  Since this is a red eye flight I recommend either delta one (first class) or premium select (aka business class).

Our aim was to each take one carry on sized piece of luggage each.  Since we had a wedding we did not check all luggage on the way to Sicily. We did not want to risk luggage getting lost with clothes for wedding.  We checked 2 bags out of three.

Customs in Catania was very quick, but we sat towards the front of the plane so if you sit in the rear it could differ.

Baggage claim took forever.  About 30/45 mins.  Class of ticket did not matter the way it would in the states.  A celebrity on our flight waited as long as we did to receive bags.

The ATM at the airport was not working.  Taxis are available outside and take credit cards.  Buses are also available, although we did not take the bus.   We did not rent a car either, we took taxis/transfer from one location to the next.

Our first location in Sicily was at Mangia’s Brucoli in Brucoli. We stayed here for a wedding.  The wedding was at a different location.  Mangia’s resort was nice, not extraordinarily nice.  The concierge booked our transfer to Noto hotel.
- [ ] No ATM onsite. 
- [ ] Tennis and paddle ball courts
- [ ] Kids club
- [ ] 3 pools
- [ ] Souvenir shops
- [ ] Restaurants on site 
Once the wedding festivities were over we went into the cute town of Brucoli.  Brucoli was very small town on the water.  We had drinks at a small bar and dinner where it was mostly locals having dinner as well.

Cafe Chantal ‘Brucoli’: before dinner drinks. I had an aperol spritz and husband had Negroni. They served potato chips with the drinks.

Trattoria I Rizzari: one of the best restaurants that we ate at in all of Sicily.  Filled with locals enjoying seafood.  We chose our fish from the daily catch selection and that was grilled.  (Scorpion fish)  We had octopus, red shrimp and some tiramisu.  The wine was amazing as is all wine in Sicily.


Noto
Noto is a beautiful city.  We spent 3 nights here and it was 3 too many.  I’d suggest another city/town and just spend the day in Noto.  I would suggest staying in Marzamemi or possibly Ragusa (we did not visit Ragusa)and visiting Noto for the day or half a day.
We stayed at Q92, very cute boutique hotel.  There was a small pool in the courtyard.  The bed and pillows were not very comfortable.  The location was perfect, steps away from cafe Sicilia.  No ATM.  Hotel concierge booked our transfer to Ortigia Airbnb.

Lots of stairs and cobblestone/brick streets.  Very picturesque city, but no need for 3 night stay, you can walk the city  in half a day.  Overall the restaurants we ate at in Noto were ok, not the top of our list. All this said there really was no bad restaurant in Sicily.

Three Farm Island: this was a farm stay we did through Airbnb. We met the owner in town ctr of Noto and he drove us to his farm.  (15/20 mins drive) Fabio and his wife were very welcoming.  They served us lunch of olives, sausage, cheese and sun dried tomato’s, bread. Fried zucchini flowers
We made our own pasta, which Ana cooked with Sicilian pesto and served as the last course.  Fabio and Ana served wine they had made themselves, delicious wine.  We were able to get a ride back into town with another guest.  We highly recommend.

Where we ate in Noto:
Picnic: grilled sea bass, ravioli, pistachio pasta & tiramisu.  This was the best food we had in Noto.

Cafe Sicilia: almond and strawberry granita with brioche and coffees.  Coffee was good, granita was ok.
Ritrovino: wine bar, charcuterie board (amazing)

Retablo: tuna, orange salad and Sicilian pesto pasta. Food was ok.

Forno Piano Altro: savory breakfast & coffee.  Perfect Sicilian breakfast.

Dammuso Noto: by the time we are here I was very full and not hungry. I shared grilled fish and had a glass of wine.

Sandwich spot: I cannot remember the name but it was on the main drag. Salad and sandwiches were very good.  
 
Marzamemi: we did a day trip from Noto.  About a 20 minute drive.  The hotel concierge organize a taxi for us to Marzamemi. We spent most of the day on the beach club.  The water was warm and beach was sandy. Very cute beach / coastal town.  It had a very Greek feeling.  We walked around a bit, went into a few shops and had a late lunch. Normally restaurants are not open around 3/4 in the afternoon.  Bubo were very kind to serve us raw seafood and some misto frito.  And of course wine.  We organized a pickup with taxi when we were dropped off.

Bubo- we had oysters, tuna tartare. Lovely staff, you can choose your daily caught sish from counter. Can’t recommend this spot more, away from most restaurants.

Lido Trireme - Hamama: this was the beach club.  They had snacks and limited prepared food. We had drinks; chips and a coffee ice cream that was yummy.


Ortigia:
Ortigia is a beautiful city located right next to Siracusa.  Ortigia is an island connected to Siracusa via a small bridge. There are actually a few bridges that you are able to drive or walk across. There is lots to see. Ortigia, ruins, museums, beaches, natural springs and shopping.
We stayed in an Airbnb in the center of the fish market, super cute.  The Airbnb host helped book transfer to Taormina.

aLevante ristorante: caponata, clam pasta, lamb dish and grilled fish. Near the fort towards the tip of the island.
Oyster & wine (ostriche and wine) this was a stand in the fish market, hit the spot. Recommend 

Drogheria Drago: we ate lunch here, seafood pasta, frito misto.  VERY good

Cortile Verda for cocktails: good cocktails and very cute courtyard to enjoy your cocktails.

Ciaru anticu: cuttlefish pasta, seared tuna 

Fish market fish cooked in Airbnb: the last night in Ortigia we bought food in the market and cooked at home.  Sooo good.

Taormina:
This transfer was about 1.5 to 2 hours.  The longest transfer of the entire time in Sicily.  Taormina is a beautiful town. Amazing views of Mt Etna and the coastline.  Isola Bella (white Lotus beach) and Spiaggia di Spisone.  Spisone was a better beach.

NH Hotel: cute hotel with a pool and spa.  No ATM. Hotel concierge was really helpful, booking restaurants and beach clubs as well as the transfer to Catania. 

Trattoria Tutti Cca: we had lunch here.  Oysters, steak and pasta con sarde.  This meal was ok.

Bar Timeo: we had cocktails here; very good cocktails served with complimentary snacks.  Breathtaking views of both Etna and the coastline.

Casa Niclodi: the best pasta of the trip, it was a goat cheese pear and speck.  We had a raw seafood dish, lobster ravioli and stuffed swordfish.  

Giardini di Babilonia: raw seafood, tomato and buffalo mozzarella, lobster, red shrimp, sea bass, pasta Ala Norma and steak.

Bar Trinacria: coffee and savory breakfast very good 

Cafe forastiero: coffee and croissants

Bam Bar (best granita in Sicily) this place is worth the wait in line.
Don Peppinu gelato: best gelato in Sicily 

 Romarino: this meal just ok, we had pasta and fish

Pasticceria D’Amore (best Connolli in Sicily)

Rosticceria Da Christina (best arancini)

D&G bar Negroni & rose (just ok, only go if you want to say you have been there)

Caravella restaurant & beach club (food was really good). We had raw fish, clams and fish and chips

Catania:
Catania was very rustic beautiful city.  Very Roman city with a lot of history. Very walkable.  Ruins, museums, parks and beaches.  We stayed in a bed and breakfast.  We booked very last minute; and not many hotels were available, so we opted for a bed & breakfast.  Owner booked transfer to airport.

Sikulo: we found out about this spot from the driver that drove us to Catania.  Very good food.  Raw seafood, caponata pasta con sarde.

Macelleria e braceria D’Antone: horse meat, salad Ala Norma and horse meatball (more like a patty) and pork chop.  This meal was 24 euros and fed the 3 of us.  Sooo good.

Puti: we had raw seafood, octopus, and grilled fish

Canni & Pisci: raw seafood plate, octopus salad, cacio Pepe with shrimp, seared tuna and grilled fish.

Overall this trip was amazing.  I can’t wait to go back.  Usually after a week of one type of cuisine my husband is itching to have something else.  Not once did he want something different.  My don’t has been asking every few days to go back.

My morning coffee

Black—

And how we stared at each other

Smiling, saying “what?”

Back and forth without actually

Knowing the question.

How the ice melted in my drink

In a short-lived sepia eye,

You finally grew cold,

When I was warm to cry,

You really could know what, my love

But I never

I’m basically looking for a kind of **“in-between” basket**.

Overall, it was about a 3/10. They kept giving me meals with meat even though I’m veg and most of it was extremely bland and/or odd tasting. The only things I actually got a chance to put an order in for was the first lunch and third breakfast, everything else was random!

Breakfast 1: scrambled eggs, hash browns, turkey sausage, apple sauce, apple juice, coffee, sad fruit cup, chemical tasting muffin

Lunch 1: wayyy over baked potato, limp grilled cheese, diet (??) iced tea

Dinner 1: chicken pot pie, orange jello 

Breakfast 2 was identical to the first

Lunch 2: veggie chili with quinoa (actually tasty but was not in the mind frame for corn and beans!!), salad, strawberry mousse possibly made from toxic waste byproduct 

Dinner 2: stuffed chicken, wild rice, green beans, melted vanilla ice cream. This was probably the best once I took the stuffing from the chicken and mixed it with the rice out of sheer desperation.

Breakfast 3: the world’s saddest pancakes, Greek yogurt, orange juice, tea

Lunch 3: chicken stir fry, fried rice, jello, chicken soup that may have been just noodles in tap water

Not pictured: had my son a little after midnight and no food whatsoever was offered beyond “you can check the nutrition room on the ward.” So I had the bread from one soggy turkey sandwich and 2 packs of peanut butter crackers around 4 am after 4+ days of labor.

**TL;DR - The entire company rests on a letter of intent from two new investors to invest £20m-£30m, dated May 2025.**

I'll try and keep it succinct. So will comment on matters relating to:

* Strategic direction
* Cashflow & Investors
* Auditors Report & Note 2.4

I'm looking at the 46 page, 21st July 2025 submission on Companies House in the UK. This has been circulated to shareholders, investors and two new potential investors who are looking at investing another '£20m to £30m' \[page 5\]. 

**Strategic Direction**

Some interesting reveals in the Business Review from the CEO. Will quickly make a note on product strategy:

>*""\[page 1\]....the Group continues to sell its product direct-to-consumer via its two respective websites, providing industry-leading margins which provide optionality for further channel expansion""*

Both LUMI and Piano M are 'out of stock' on Amazon as of July 2025, but for £99, you can buy a [Gemini Sound PianoProdigy 24-Key](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Gemini-Sound-PianoProdigy-Expandable-Bluetooth/dp/B0CVNMXJLB/ref=sr_1_9?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.6emGQXrN5ZcZ_12QRgYdS8USWuixum0rQmDctkMVaMRO4Q-oCxx0DooJEvc4aHaoquSNRZwQJIvOdsbgg6PPpAP0wrOuMa9fSMTOxio58XaOS2pxrqTHQDEnnstIMfwc1UFcezzFSDj5AFub01HITaDeC-AfLvdGYLwP52w3xXT7xcINdlDbKfsBg9bXKD5qruNiVXNzdO0gkb1H13RAEK2Hex8AdwxOW5dGUQi2uIYPnCKF8NVstO2Hl_o0zdOvzkp2KAfYVZN3oKvZxiI12zQBvoRfSAqBcR0zoDPbhCA.fWQ7J-8rt-xpGTgvLztU6tamh8trD_Cza9QI8BSw3uk&dib_tag=se&keywords=lumi+keyboard&qid=1753464515&sr=8-9) that connects to a phone via bluetooth. The offering looks like you can link up the keyboards as well. Obviously, it's hot trash (the product trailer video made me spit my coffee) and the LUMI is way better, but nice to see a competitor that delivers via Amazon. Give it another 24 months. Speaking of the music education market:

>*""\[page 1\]....as a point of reference, the Group estimates the global music learning market to be approximately $78bn per year, of which only \~2% is digitised.""*

Most of the learning is on YouTube for free. Some incredible platforms operate via free trials (soundgym.co) and the rest is hidden behind paywalls (e.g. OpenStudio). Anyone can research and estimate a global market. My research is Google's top 4 results (""global music education market"") and I'm getting figures like [$17bn](https://www.businessresearchinsights.com/market-reports/online-music-education-market-108932), [$3.3bn](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/online-music-education-market), [$6.3bn](https://dataintelo.com/report/global-music-training-education-market) and [$4.3bn](https://www.metastatinsight.com/report/online-music-education-market). Even by a ballpark, $78bn is overestimated. This seems like a justification for short-term losses at future revenue streams due to \[page 2, Principal Risks and Uncertainties\]: ***""deep innovation""***.

Whatever the hell that means. If I was losing money hand over fist and saw knock off LUMIs on Amazon for £99. I'd get over myself and sell it on whatever platform I could, unless there's such a problem with stock that they had to close their UK Amazon sales channel in 2024 and it still isn't realistic to open in July 2025. 

**Cashflow & Investors**

What's fascinating is that on page 3, under 'cashflow risk', the company has said it's taken out £5.6m in convertible loans in 2024/25 (basically offering shares in the company to creditors). It's also recognised that there's risk of stock being overvalued and even obsolescent on page 2 due to being slow-moving, so that backs up the UK Amazon sales channel point. Page 28 shows that the largest turnover increase has been European software subscriptions. 

Page 4 states that the Group has made a loss of £26m in 2024 compared to £10.6m in 2023. Shocking, right? **Wrong.** ROLI is a start-up and losses are irrelevant to investors. What investors care about is [cash flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_is_king). Page 17 shows an impairment of intangible assets of £10.9m. 

Because of this impairment, the cashflow only looks a little worse than last year; just £2m worse off, which the external comms seem to be echoing as geopolitical and external supply chain issues. In reality, if ROLI didn't choose to impair their assets then their net cash used in 2024 would have been north of £21m, more than 2.5 times more than £8m in 2023. 

Realistically though, in the world of corporate finance, you need to impair your assets if you're going to receive new cash, so they've done this impairment as they really need that £20m-£30m investment, so they didn't have a choice.

To wrap up cashflow, on page 39, ROLI has a £27m loan agreement that expires on 31 August 2026. There's an option to keep this going for another 10 years, and if it started on 31 August 2021, then by my rough calculations it'll mature for about £6m by 2036. **What the corporate strategy seems to be doing is offering more equity in ROLI rather than actually paying off debt.**

The impairment charge, current debt/equity ratio and product development shows me that ROLI is trying to set itself up for more investment. And finally, the

**Auditors Report & Note 2.4**

These auditor reports are fairly dry, but I'm gonna say the auditors have done a stellar job in highlighting issues here.  
  
Definitions:  
'Material uncertainty' = really unsure about  
'Going concern' = viability.   
  
The auditors say in no uncertain terms:

>*""We draw attention to note 2.4 in the financial statements, which indicates that the Group incurred a loss for the year ended 30 June 2024 of £26,123,876...The Group's and Company's future growth, hence profit making and cash generation will depend on the succes of new products and new markets (See: Strategic Direction) to be developed and the continued support of existing and new shareholders (See Cashflow & Investors). These events or conditions, along with the other matters set forth in note 2.4, indicate that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the Group's or the parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this manner.""*

Note 2.4 is on Page 21. Summary of it is as follows:

* additional finance needs to be raised to provide the Group with the resources to execute its strategy and ensure that the Group can continue to operate;
* having to get new investments and the uncertainty of sales projections to 2028 means that the company might not actually be viable;
* but because the directors have an expectation based on the research they have conducted, the directors have prepared their accounts to show that they're still continuing business.

An auditor's modified opinion basically means a company is cooked. From where I am, ROLI has just narrowly avoided that opinion by providing assurances that the global education market is worth some $78bn and its 'deep research' is going to take advantage of that market imminently. 

Oh, and managing to secure £20m to £30m worth of new investment.

Honestly, I cannot wait for 2025's accounts. 

See you next year.

1m98i5s,https://www.reddit.com/r/FlashTV/comments/1m98i5s/i_hate_team_flash/,I hate team flash,"Cisco, Harrison Wells from earth 2, and Caitlin have all done extremely questionable and illegal things.

However, in season 4, when Barry starts questioning devoe and looking into him, all of a sudden they all have a moral compass like they never imprisoned meta humans without trial, or attempted to kill them and normal people, or created weapons used by criminals, or aided Zoom/Savitar.

As for Iris, I genuinely loathe her character. I don't know why the directors thought she should become the leader of Team Flash, and then continue to be that. She should have remained a reporter and stuck to helping people in ways Barry/The Flash couldn't.

But no, she just has to be the leader when she is useless in general. I don't hate the actor, but I swear to god, every scene she is in genuinely makes me want to remove my ears. Good god, I can't stand her. She has no qualifications, outside of making coffee at Jitters and being a Journalist, and suddenly she can write programs to train Wally, and run their entire interface when she was useless in seasons 1, 2, and 3. A 6 month time skip shouldn't have done anything, and Cisco should have remained in control.

Also, she always has to one up Barry emotionally, or tell him how to feel or think like he isn't a fully functioning adult.

I don't know why, but every single team in the CW universe sucks. Team Arrow sucks, and Oliver was perfect and interesting without them. Team Flash sucks, and Barry is perfect and entertaining without them. The Legends suck without Rip Hunter, whose acting was exceptional (I couldn't continue it after he left). Super girl, I couldn't even watch it. I like Supergirl herself, but I can't stand most of the people around her (although I really, really, really love Cat Grant).

Will Iris continue to be insufferable, or will she eventually be rightfully side lined? Also, am I the only person who hates this portrayal of Iris West?

Edit: Why does she always say 'It is gonna take everything we have to take ""Insert Villian"" down' when she contributes nothing? Barry always makes the decisions in the end after Cisco/Caitlin/Harrison draw up a plan alongside him. She just gives the usual 'Run Barry, run' sentence at the end.",2,1753471767.0,FlashTV,7,0.6,False

We’ve been together for about a year, and we’re in the same class. In the beginning, everything felt exciting and close. But now, I feel tired, anxious, and like I’m walking on eggshells around him. I love him a lot, and I’m very close to his family, which makes all of this harder to talk about or even think about leaving.

Here are some of the things that have been happening:
	•	When I’m at his place, he often plays video games for hours. I fall asleep waiting for him, and instead of spending time with me after, he goes out with his friends without telling me. When I wake up and ask where he is, he says “I’ll be back soon,” but stays out for two more hours.
	•	When I tell him something is bothering me, he just says “Okay, sorry, it’s my fault,” but nothing ever changes. It feels like he only says sorry to shut down the conversation.
	•	We had this routine of saying “good morning” to each other every day. One day he didn’t say anything and just sent me a picture of a paper he needed me to send for him. When I told him that hurt me, he said, “I don’t care, I’m tired of everything.” When I asked, “Are you tired of me too?” he said yes.
	•	One time, I told him I was home (even though I wasn’t yet), and he made me send a photo to prove it. When I go out, he makes me send pictures every 10 minutes of where I am and who I’m with. He doesn’t let me go to clubs or talk to any guys unless they’re classmates.
	•	He has the password to my phone and checks it often, especially if we haven’t seen each other in a few days.
	•	He gets annoyed when I talk to my female friends and says bad things about them. When I try to talk about how I feel or when I’m sad, he often turns it around and acts like he’s the victim — like he’s always the one who gets hurt or has to say sorry.

Because of all this, I feel like I have to be extremely careful with everything I say or do. I’m scared of starting a fight or upsetting him.

Also, about 6 months ago, I found out he went for coffee with his ex-girlfriend and his friend’s niece. He searched for his ex on Snapchat, added her, and they were snapping for a few days. He lied to me about when he removed her — we even saw each other during that time, and I later found out he deleted her while I was with him, then added her again right after I left. I forgave him and tried to move on, but now, looking back, it feels like part of a bigger pattern of hiding things and not respecting me.

With months we have already planned to go only the two of us, but now 1 week before the vacation she said her parents will come in the same city in the same dates and we will go together. Separate hotels on different sides of the town, we will still be alone, but ofc we will sometimes go together on beaches, dinners, coffee etc. But it is still not only the two of us as I wanted.

Is this normal in relationships or not? I dont mind going with them, but we already were like 2-3 weekends together on camping this summer and what not, so I sometimes want to be only us or sometimes with friends.

My gf thinks that it is not that big of a problem since we will still be alone there most of the time and she is more of a family lifestyle where she respects them and cant just say “don’t come with us we want to be alone”. 

And I come from a family which always said “u are young and you should go out together or with friend couples, not with older people”.

So we are conflicting in that sense and she says that my way is dumb way to look on life since our parents arent going to be there always and that friends come and go, but the family will always be for us when we need them. Her family is more of the type to just travel, but they want us to go with them always and my gf cant say no to them since she thinks its disrespect to them, but I see that as disrespect towards me and my wish to be alone. And to that my gf says that I should try and be more friendly with them and not avoid them that much, but I think thats the product of them always trying to insert themselves into everything that we do. They also want to live their life and travel and have fun and I respect it, but I don’t want to be that much with them all the time like they and my gf does and I just don’t know if I am the weird one for trying to avoid their love to travel with us. 

At this point I feel like this will be the reason we will have arguments and that it will be the reason if the relationship ends, since If I don’t accept this, I will lose her, we agree to that. We know that if we separate its gonna be because of a third party and how we see life and relationship goals and not our love, since we love each other a lot.

Sometimes I feel like we mutually feel like we have a connection but we can't act on it because we're working colleagues. I'll be leaving my job soon so I feel like we're getting closer.


We went for a walk on the beach and ended up spending a good 30 minutes just sitting and talking. I found her a seashell, but I forgot to give it to her when I dropped her off at home. 

I texted her asking if she was settled in, and she wanted to know why. I told her that I forgot to give her the seashell and I immediately folded and said it's stupid and I'll go die in a ditch from embarrassment. She laughed it off and said yes pls. 


I feel like sending a cute letter to her with the seashell, but I'm worried that she might think it's too much. Were technically not dating, but hanging out alone 


The note would say 

""Please hold onto this seashell for me. 

Serves as a memento of a time where I watched a shitty sunset with someone that sees the world through a different lens - in a good way!

I thought a long time about if i should post this, but it's the sad truth that needs to be spoken about at least once.

I just came back from a vacation in tunisia. I've been to tunisia many times and usually defended it from the typical pessimistic ""everything sucks here""-tunisians. I still think it's a lovely country with the kindest people. I don't speak much arabic but i'm learning, and the more i understand the more i realize: if you're a tourist, they have no respect for you. I've never had such a bad trip to my parent's country. I came to tunisia feeling really proud of myself because i'm trying to learn the language and fit in more to stop the tourist stereotype, but what i was greeted with was endless discussions with taxt drivers, discussions with hotel staff and being lied in my face by shop owners. Tourists are literally only seen as a walking money bag, even if you tell them you're part tunisian, even if you speak arabic with them. Of course my arabic isn't anything like a local, but why not try to make tourists have a nice experience in your country so they'll return instead of ruining their opinion of your country?
Everyday when i left the hotel, the taxi drivers waited outside and tried ripping me off (30TND for a 8TND trip), ignoring my question to turn on the metre. 2nd day I told him that's illegal and he shrugged, not giving a damn.
Another taxi driver accepted my 10TND offer and said turning the AC on costs 5 dinar extra. So we drove 15min in the heat without turning an AC on.
The Hotel (of course it doesnt apply to all hotels, but that's my experience from staying in a 5 star hotel for the first time instead of a 3 star hotel): 3 days i had to complain at the reception that we didn't get a single towel, 3 times they told me they'll bring one immediately, 3 times they lied to my face, making me shower without a towel available. When i checked out, they just told me ""this isn't really a tourist hotel"", does this excuse literally not providing the bare minimum as a 5 star hotel? No. (Don't ask why i didnt go again and wait at the reception for them to arrive. I went twice one day and eventually had appointments, i had no time to wait any longer for the maid to arrive *some time*) 
The last day i took my cousin to the souk (local tunisian, hijabi, definitely no tourist). I went to a shop i remembered that had good prices. I bought something and then asked him for something else and asked him to give me a good price, if he's giving me that i'll come back and buy more. He looked me in my face and agreed and gave me the price, 12 dinar. I asked if we can make it 10 and he agreed. My cousin then comes up telling me that's too high (should've cost 4 dinar lol) and he got mad at her??? Infront of me and other visitors for telling me the price isn't fair.. ""why did you tell her"" he asks the girl i literally entered the shop with...
Another day in the hotel i got myself a coke and a coffee, of course the prices are ridiculously high but i was thirsty. At that point i was already feeling like a walking money bag and i hated the feeling, so i decided to calm down with the tips a little bit. The drinks shouldve cost 18 dinar, i decided to just give him 20. He looked at me and told me ""thats the exact price"" and i just nodded ""um yeah?"", i didnt realize he was asking for a tip until he left, but he literally asked for a higher price?? 

I've never felt so disrespected and used than this trip to tunisia. I always considered tunisian people as kind, honest and caring people. Now after this trip, with these endless discussions i don't even feel comfortable coming to tunisia anymore because i'm not seen as a person that deserves honesty, but as a walking money bag. Sure, europeans do have more money than tunisians, but that doesn't mean you need to rip everyone off that tries to have a nice time. Do a good service and everyone is happy to give a tip. (Funnily enough i gave the maid good tips daily just to return to my room with 5 missing towels and 1 missing blanket...). 
Not everyone is doing luxury vacations, some people just travel to experience the culture and local life. I prefer eating chapati at a shop at the corner instead of going to fancy restaurants, i dont ride the camels at the beach but make sure to help the people in need that i see selling tissues. I am blessed enough to make enough money to visit my relatives once a year in tunisia, but i'm not blessed enough to throw my money around like a millionaire. People need to understand, rich people go on vacation in dubai, switzerland or the usa, not tunisia so for the love of God, stop getting these 🤑 eyes whenever a tourist is nearby. 

Well, thank you for reading my rant. Don't start any heated discussions please, i've had enough discussions with tunisians the last 2 weeks😮‍💨. After 30 years, i've never been so discouraged to visit my parent's country again and i'm honestly very sad about how now that i'm starting to understand more tunisian arabic, i'm second-questioning every kind interaction i've ever had there. I know a lot of people in tunisia, friends and relatives but at this point i'm just wondering how i'm being viewed as literally every person i met this time tried ripping me off in one way or another.

With even just one cup, my body reacts the way it did when I once overdosed on caffeine pills years ago. Stomachache, severe nausea, racing heart, dizziness, crazy tremors, severe anxiety, derealization, depersonalization. It lasts for like 15 hours. Before Trulicity, I was a heavy coffee drinker.

I’m saying coffee specifically because I don’t drink anything else with caffeine in it, and it’s too awful a reaction for me to want to experiment with tea. I’m guessing it’s the caffeine, but I know coffee is hard on the stomach as it is.

I’m also guessing much of it is due to slow gastric emptying… with that stuff just sitting in my stomach for hours. But the reaction is absolutely insane.

I took a promotion that is making me lose sleep due to long hours and anxiety, and I tried coffee again for the first time the other weekend to see if anything had changed, but it hasn’t. To be unable to help my exhaustion with coffee sucks so bad. Especially when I have to grin a “none for me, thanks!” through my teeth whenever anyone goes on a coffee run. The sweet scent of that forbidden elixir wafts like oxygen through the office!!!

Has anyone else had issues with this? And is it coffee specifically, or caffeine in general? Like I said, I really don’t want to try black or green tea because I’m so terrified of experiencing the same thing again, even for a day. I lived in the UK for a few years way back when, and black tea is STRONG (tbf I was drinking “builder’s tea”). Is anyone here unable to tolerate caffeinated coffee, but able to tolerate caffeinated tea? Or unable to tolerate caffeine at all? Or is this not a common issue?

OCD: ""What if you’re actually a bad person pretending to be good?""
You: ""Yep, caught me!! I’m the villain in a plot twist literally no one asked for.""

OCD: ""What if you’re secretly racist/sexist/horrible?""
You: ""Right, because people who obsessively fear being offensive are totally the evil masterminds of society.""

OCD: ""You want to stab someone.""

OCD: ""What if you push your friend off a cliff?""
You: ""Then I guess I’m the worst action movie villain ever. Chill, Fast & Furious isn’t casting me.""

The Congo had spent the war years operating increasingly independently of its legal possessor, now housed in London. The colonial gendarme organized with Allied assistance, followed Allied war plans in East Africa, and shipped raw material with Allied escort to fill Allied orders. Belgium had not disappeared, but it was ever so distant. But, in the first week of Operation Sealion, it simply ceased to exist. Crushed under the rubble of Eaton Square, the Congo was left unpossessed, with a state now largely incapable of legal action.



While paralysis gripped British holdings, the Americans acted swiftly to keep the Congo functioning. 5 weeks is all it took for the creatively named 'État du Congo' to creatively legislate its sovereignty. Although plainly intended as a temporary measure, it long outlasted the war that had spawned it. As Belgian intellectuals arrived on American shores, they and their 'Congo Question' would rub closely with the renewed martyrs of the New Deal. After De Gaulle's rebellion was ejected across the river, the question only became more prescient. Finally, in 1948, Dwight Eisenhower campaigned on the Congo Question, under the influence of men like Spaak and Ryckmans, aiming to redefine the US's strained relationship with the world.



The Model Republic it was titled, the standard by which the whole world would be judged. Cut from the same cloth as the OFN, dressed in the dazzling colors of internationalist liberalism. A defiant corner of Europe's other continent. Old WPAmen stamped a million papers with such phrasing, citizens committees raised funds to send Belgians to Léopoldville, American government and church schools ran the length of its rivers. A founding member of the OFN, crowds would say as Eisenhower opined for 'his little Congo'. However, the realities of the young République du Congo were complicated. The Model Republic, the great corporatocracy, a parliament governed by circles, parties politely worn by the simple interests which composed them. Where the US had the PWA or NLRB, Congo had the Société Générale du Congo, a parastatal unparalleled, composed from the remains of the Belgian institution. Education governed by the Church, Labor governed by its paymasters, all in collaboration. Freedom of movement, of business, of franchise - each were carefully constrained, ordered behind 'certificates' with exams designed for bias. 'Preparation,' it was termed, so that the nation was ready for its freedom.



The economy was ordered in the image of America's New Deal, as a long list of economic packages came to define the relationship between the US and the Congo in the terms of sovereign debt and investment. Under Belgian stewardship the Congo's central economic corridors all drove south, into Angola or Rhodesia, for the Americans, this had to change. The Congo was dotted with public works - bridges, rail expansions, and river ports - each of them intended to redirect the economy towards Matadi, the Congo's key Atlantic port. However, despite these attempts, the Benguela railway, leading to Lobito, in Angola, remains the larger economic thoroughfare. Complicated further, by its ownership - Tanganyika Concessions Limited, one of the very few European companies to still conduct business directly with OFN member nations. Tanks, as it's called, maintains at least parts of its 89-year charter in Katanga, granted in the times of the Free State. As civil government approaches daily life in the rest of the Congo, in Katanga it remains distant, as the CSK, the UMHK and other holdings and siblings of the Société Générale dominate its economy and political life.



For years these affairs continued, loosened ever so slightly, ever so rarely. It was the French State's evacuation of Equatorial Africa that spurned the next great change. Nearly as soon as the French had left, the Congolese had arrived, spearheaded by their own Frenchmen, and sent ahead by their own superpower. In many places they were met with collaboration, if not cheers, in others it was not so simple. The Force Publique, newly republican, did not negotiate. Within months, the UPC was pushed from Yaoundé into the borders and highlands, replaced swiftly with one of the many Commonwealth governments that now comprised the United States of Latin Africa.



None of this was popular with the Congolese soldiers, not the occupation, and much less the ongoing campaigns against 'banditry'. But, what really got to them was something different. In Brazzaville, a soldier could sit in a Cafe, order a cup of coffee, and simply be served - even by a white waiter. In Léopoldville this was essentially unthinkable. It was a simple fact - these people had more rights than them. Many more could vote than in the Congo, many more could travel freely than in the Congo, black men occupied many if not most of the key roles, something alien to the Congo. Here, the Congolese saw independence, and at home, well, they were not so sure.



Nationalist sentiments exploded in the Congo, the brutality of the state's response only further driving their furor. What little political rights had been loosened became clamped, that is, until the explosion. When an ABAKO assembly was declared illegal, and, despite the efforts of its leaders, proceeded anyway, the rally was suppressed violently. Kasa Vubu, imprisoned, was now the very face of the nation, the face of a new era of nationalists who now came to the stage. For a full year the state attempted to repress dissidents and raise collaborators, but each strategy subverted the other. Leaders like Bolikango and Bolya distanced themselves from the government, as repression of dissidents found only more and more targets.



And then it ended, as riots in Leopoldville inspired strikes in Elisabethville. The old Congolese political system shattered to pieces, a new, reformist coalition ushered to power over its corpse. The old political parties, increasingly identified as the 'white parties', found room for compromise or perished. A broadened electorate and renewed elections cemented the shift - as the Congo became governed by the Kartel de la Réforme and its very first African Prime Minister - Jean Bolikango.



Reform, and Africanization, have been slow to progress, even years out from Bolikango's ascendancy. The KdR succeeded in navigating the Congo out of its last political crisis, but its defective four years of governance have drawn to question whether it can do any more than that. Nationalists foment at its edges, their once assured allegiance increasingly drawn into question. Whereas, the European minority remains fractured over the new political conditions in the Congo, picket fences and neighborhood walls carry graffiti decrying 'les traîtres' underlining the far more serious contentions deep within the Congo's state.

Further abreast of the Congo and its struggles are its very own sister states - the Kingdoms of Rwanda and Burundi. Bound by one of the last treaties to mention 'the United Nations', the now-republican Force Publique of the then-independent Congo guards the very same positions they took up after the countries were taken from Germany. Indeed, these are among the furthest outposts of the OFN, host to an array of listening systems, observation posts, and defense plans that begin with retreat. Burundi is a small island of calm amidst a sea of change. Governed by a clade of its young chiefs, educated in the West and in many ways attached to the OFN. To many in Burundi, the presence of the Americans liberates the country from the domination of Security politics, and offers yet another vector of stability within the careful ethnic and social balance at play in the country.

Rwanda, however, is a kingdom in crisis, torn at its by ethnic conflict and class conflict wound and tied together. The Bahutu Manifesto has transformed Rwandan politics, and brought confrontations of increasing scale to the forefront. As tensions rise in the Congo, they begin to boil in Rwanda, and should the Congo falter, its distant satellite will fall.

# East Africa:

https://preview.redd.it/z7eddwv5i2ff1.png?width=1672&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5e653817263ad47be8592bda1108c5d4d55b0fa

In contrast to the ostensibly liberal-democratic Congo, East Africa is where the colonial ancien regime is at its strongest. Governed under the retrograde darkness of the British Empire since the end of the war, the peoples of East Africa cry out for freedom from British rule.

The heart of both the region's resistance and its colonisation lies in **Kenya**. As the settler-colony of the British aristocracy, Kenya serves as the new crown jewel of the Empire, with many of the BPP's foremost leaders holding estates there. However, the prosperity of Kenya's settler elite was built on the blood of its native peoples, and a reckoning was due. This reckoning came in the early 1950s, with the rise of the **Kenya Land and Freedom Army** (quickly dubbed **""Mau Mau""** by the Administration, a name that would become popularised in the British press). Being drawn largely from the Kikuyu, Embu, and Meru ethnicities, due to them having been displaced from the majority of their land for the ""White Highlands"" project, the KLFA began a rebellion against the colonial administration, killing several settlers and one of Kenya's foremost collaborationist chiefs, Senior Chief Waruhiu. Britain responded quickly, sending the decorated general Gerald Templer to Kenya, allowing him to form a martial law administration and giving him carte blanche to deal with the Kenyan people as he saw fit. He implemented a brutal policy, confining any natives with suspect loyalties into various forms of concentration camp. Only those with a proven record of loyalty, fighting for the colonial administration, were exempt. While fighting continued for years, the brutality of the British forces and their collaborators proved impossible for the KLFA to overcome. Now, in 1962, the once-formidable movement is a spent force.

Kenya's western neighbour, **Uganda**, remains mostly quiet, with much of the unrest there being overspill from Kenya, while a pliant collaborationist class runs the colony.

 To the south, in Tanganyika, the Ghanaian Revolution and First Great Uprising led to the **Tanganyika African National Union** beginning an armed struggle against the colonial administration, although the British suppressed the uprising within a few months. The survivors, including their leader, **Julius Nyerere**, were forced to flee abroad, first to the Congo and then to Azad Hind, where they live in exile, training and preparing for the day when they can once more return to liberate Tanganyika. 

https://preview.redd.it/f7c3yjx9i2ff1.png?width=1287&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7a6eca3adccbb77c799f56c051f42af3c676589

The neighbouring **Sultanate of Zanzibar** remains a largely stable protectorate, but any instability in Tanganyika could quickly cause the same there. 



https://preview.redd.it/60s90v99i2ff1.png?width=1432&format=png&auto=webp&s=76cdaf4eb5f0d2113b4eb9118a36145173caae6e

To the south, the colonies of **Southern Rhodesia**, **Northern Rhodesia**, and **Nyasaland** are bound together in the **Central African Federation**, a loose economic union, set up to benefit Britain and the settler elite of the Rhodesias first and foremost. In Southern Rhodesia, the previously politically dominant United Rhodesia Party served a serious split in the immediate post-war period over the issue of collaborationism and whether to recognise the London government, and the more right-wing, hardline Liberal Party swept to power in the face of it, under the leadership first of Jacob Smit, and then of his successor, **Ian Smith**. In far-away **Mauritius**, the ripples of East Africa’s politics have nonetheless reached the colony. As Templer’s administration in Kenya began to look for a place for “permanent exile” of 'recalcitrant' Mau Mau followers, they settled on Mauritius, with the assent of the ruling Franco-Mauritian planter oligarchy. The introduction of slave labour into the Mauritian economy severely destabilised its already violent and fractured racial caste system, and the Indian government looks upon the majority-Indian colony with disgust at the continued British repression of their people.



The Empire's grip in East Africa will be shattered by the Second Great Uprising in 1963. Ironically, the greatest blow inflicted upon it will come not from the rebel groups that have opposed the Empire for years, but from their own colonial army. A battalion of the King's African Rifles, stationed in Tanganyika, will mutiny against their British employers after a months-long stoppage of pay caused by the chaos. The mutiny will throw the colony into disarray, forcing a speedy withdrawal and allowing the TANU to return from Azad Hind and take up its governance. Further south, in Nyasaland, the fall of Tanganyika will lead to the British and Rhodesians both concluding that the colony cannot be held, and beginning a military and administrative withdrawal to Northern Rhodesia. The ""abandonment"" of Nyasaland will scarcely be noticed in Britain, but it will cause shockwaves in Southern Rhodesia, with the Liberal Party's hardliners enraged at Smith for allowing the Union Jack to be brought down in Africa, and ousting him, replacing him with the right-wing ideologue **William Harper**. Elsewhere in East Africa, while colonialism is able to hold during the Uprising, the independence of Tanganyika causes shockwaves, allowing old rebel groups, like the KLFA, to revitalise, and new rebel groups, like those in Northern Rhodesia, to form. But make no mistake - the Empire in East Africa has been dealt a blow, but it has not been vanquished. The Republic of Tanganyika must lead the banner of independence forward, or it may find itself consumed as it once was before.

# Iberian Africa:

https://preview.redd.it/x0yduolmi2ff1.png?width=1999&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8bf91980d4713072620a3b508ce132608169125

The Iberian Union was never conceived of as a unitary state, but as a partnership between two brother nations, **Spain** and **Portugal**. At the Union’s formation, a special exception was made to keep each nation’s colonial ministry separate by mutual demand. The Portuguese Colonial Ministry oversees the colonies of **Angola**, **Mozambique**, **São Tomé and Príncipe**, and **Cape Verde,** while its Spanish counterpart administers **Equatorial Guinea** and **Western Sahara**.

On paper, the Portuguese colonies represent a more humane alternative to their nakedly white supremacist counterparts in Britain and France. Trumpeting the ideology of Lusotropicalism, the Portuguese have long portrayed themselves as a uniquely benevolent imperial project capable of peacefully incorporating native Africans into a civilization that combines the best of its disparate members. Behind the propaganda, however, lie some of the most backwards and repressive colonial regimes on the continent, replete with underdevelopment, exploitation, and a strict racial hierarchy. For decades into the Twentieth Century, the colonies languished on the periphery of Portugal's attention, little more than a source of coffee, minerals, and prestige. This began to change after the implementation of the *Estado Novo* in 1933. Under **Antonio Salazar's** leadership, greater attention was paid to the colonies as sources of ideological pride as much as material wealth, in line with the theory of Lusotropicalism. For subjects of the Portuguese overseas empire, however, this change in official attitude did not translate into changes in day-to-day life. Indeed, reformers in the colonial ministry remained sidelined throughout the 1940s and 1950s. The triumph of the Reich's New Order did much to vindicate a more ruthless view of the world, and colonial officials in Lisbon, Lusotropicalist ideals notwithstanding, were no less susceptible to such views than anyone else.

It is in the crown jewel of Portuguese Africa, **Angola**, that the consequences of such attitudes first appeared. During the 1950s, thousands of Angolans fled the poverty and forced labor of the colony for better prospects in neighboring Congo, congregating in the capital of Léopoldville. Here, prominent Angolan refugees were soon entangled in Congolese political intrigues and increasingly nationalist undercurrents, although they never forgot the homeland they had fled. The epitome of this phenomenon is **Holden Roberto**, an Angolan who spent nearly his whole life in the Congo, taking leadership of the exiled Angolan Kongo separatist movements in the 1950s, coalescing into the United Party of Angola (UPA). In 1959, Roberto took advantage of labor discontent in the north of the country and, inspired by wider unrest around the continent, he attempted to launch an incursion from the Congo. His haphazard attempt at revolution posed no serious threat to the colonial regime, but it had enough popular support to awaken officials out of a self-assured stupor. Their belated response proved brutal, sending the rebels fleeing back across the border, with close to a million refugees behind them, amplifying Congo's existing political crises. American intelligence and the Congolese administration cajoled Roberto's newly founded UPA into forming a coalition with myriad other Angolan liberation organizations, even the radicals of **Augustinho Neto's** **MPLA**, recently returned from a long exile in Brazil. Together they formed the **Democratic Front for the Liberation of Angola (FDLA)**. 

Now, in 1962, the FDLA has organized a second Angolan incursion, though it faces prospects little better than the first. These repeated failures have spurred increasing disillusionment with Roberto's authoritarian leadership. More militant members in the FDLA have begun to look towards the Azad Hind-trained **Jonas Savimbi** as a challenger to Roberto. They insist that a change in strategy is required, and that Roberto's fixation on the north is a product of his Bakongo chauvinism rather than revolutionary principle. For these dissidents, eastern Angola beckons. In Launda, the Portuguese have grown increasingly aware of the role of the Congo in their African misfortunes and consider options to neutralize its influence. However, the Portuguese must be cautious in this; Léo'ville is no scattered guerrilla band, and is a key American partner to boot. 

On the other side of the continent, in **Mozambique**, the situation is quite different. Under the steady, experienced leadership of Governor-General **Gabriel Maurício Teixeira**, the colony has seen none of the violence or chaos experienced by its Atlantic counterpart. True, the state's cotton regime has spread misery throughout the north while the inadequacies of southern subsistence farming force unnumbered thousands into grueling labor in the mines of South Africa and Rhodesia - but this is simply the natural order of life in the eyes of the Portuguese. Opposition to the regime, such as it exists outside of a few hushed meetings from dissident settler exiles, is to be found outside of the colony itself. It is with the migrant laborers abroad that the stirrings of organized resistance can be found, and even then, it is with movements in their nascency. The sisal plantation laborers in neighboring British Tanganyika and the dockworkers in Kenya have formed the **Mozambican African National Union (MANU)**; in Southern Rhodesia, the **National Democratic Union of Mozambique (UDENAMO)** speaks quietly but boldly for the need for radical action; in Nyasaland, there are the Anglophone migrants of the **National African Union of Independent Mozambique (UNAMI)**. Taken together, these groups are small, uncoordinated, and without the support needed to match even the FDLA's abortive attempts at rebellion. Until the enemies of colonialism in Mozambique unite, the administration in Lourenço Marques has little to fear. 

In his office at Syracuse University, **Dr. Eduardo Mondlane**, a one-time State Department employee, prepares another speech on the cruelties of colonialism and the need to stand against it globally. The year is 1962, and his patience is running thin.

In contrast to Angola and Mozambique, which have always been the focus of Lisbon's attention, the smaller colonies of Portuguese Africa have struggled thanks to long-term neglect. The colony of **Guiné**, a small carve-out along the West African coast, has been a Portuguese possession since the Sixteenth Century, but has precious little to show for it. Infrastructure of any kind, already negligible, becomes nonexistent the further one travels from the capital of Bissau. Independence efforts in the colony have been active since the 1950s, with **Amílcar Cabral** and his **African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC)** leading the way. Officially, the PAIGC is only one member of the larger Guinean **United Liberation Front (FUL)** hosted in Accra by President Kwame Nkrumah, but this alliance has proved unstable since its inception owing to serious disagreements over tactics, goals, and the role of Cape Verdeans in the Guinean struggle. 

The Portuguese island colonies, **Cape Verde** and **São Tomé and Príncipe**, are unique in that they lack an indigenous population, having been uninhabited at the time of European arrival. Both island groups quickly became important nodes in the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade, and thus strategically important to the Portuguese. The majority of Cape Verdeans and Saotomeans are *creoles*, with a mix of European and African heritage, putting them in an awkward middle ground between their Portuguese colonial rulers and other African colonial subjects. The ***crioulos*** of Cape Verde and the ***forros*** of São Tomé and Príncipe are considered ***assimilados*** by the Portuguese Colonial Ministry and the Iberian government, allowing them citizenship as a class rather than on an individual basis. Due to this, neither group is subject to the rules of the ***Estatuto dos Indigenas*** that govern life for the majority of Portugal's colonial subjects. Despite this measure of privilege, neither colony has escaped from the violence and mismanagement so common to Portuguese rule. For now, these islands have yet to see much direct nationalist agitation compared to their mainland counterparts, but this may soon change as organized resistance to colonial oppression spreads like a wildfire across Africa.

On the other half of the patchwork Iberian empire, Spain has fallen far from their glory days as a colonial superpower. Where Portugal holds colonies rich in land and resources, with hundreds of thousands of settlers to boot, Spain's remaining colonies are poor, tiny, and hardly developed. They are less zones of extraction or new frontiers than consolation prizes; they remind men like *Caudillo* **Francisco Franco** of what Spain used to be, even as it has fallen so short of that vision. 

The Berlin Conference of 1884 legitimized Spain's claim to **Western Sahara,** although the land itself was of little value. Rather, it served as a natural springboard for Spanish penetration into Morocco and Mauritania. While French influence blocked off the latter route, Spain continued to insist on its right to a sphere of influence in Morocco. Eventually, this claim was substantiated with a protectorate zone based around the Rif, Cape Juby, and Sidi Ifni. In the aftermath of the Second World War, the Reich pressured France into surrendering its control over the rest of Morocco to Franco in return for his seizure of Gibraltar from the British. Over the following years, Spain returned the territories of Spanish Morocco to Rabat as a way of ensuring the Sultan's loyalty; Western Sahara, however, remained under Madrid's control into the Iberian Union. 

Sultan **Hassan II**, having only recently succeeded his father, Mohammed V, continues to insist on Morocco's ""historical claims"" on all of the Sahara. So far, Madrid has politely but firmly rebuffed these entreaties each time the topic has come up, but the fever of Greater Moroccan irredentism has Rabat in its iron grip. The various factions in Morocco disagree on many issues, but almost all agree that the country must expand its borders.

Contrasted with the uniquely underdeveloped Western Sahara, Spain's territory on the **Gulf of Guinea** is a much more typical example of colonial management. The colony is divided between the Insular Province, the islands of **Fernando Po and Annobón**, and the Continental Province of **Río Muni**. The extensive inequality between the two halves of the colony has long been a source of internal tension. The Insular Province has prospered (in a relative sense) as the economic heart of the colony, thanks to the establishment of extensive plantations dealing in cacao, coffee, and tobacco, Río Muni has historically been treated as little more than a preserve for lumber and labor. Indeed, the demand for African labor to work the plantations on Fernando Po has always dominated colonial decision-making, and at one time necessitated the importation of labor from Nigeria and Liberia. In recent years, however, migrant labor has primarily arrived from Cape Verde and Angola, now part of the greater Iberian Union; the resulting penetration of Portuguese influence into Equatorial Guinea has not gone unnoticed. 

Despite its small size and suppression by the colonial authorities, Equatorial Guinea has produced several movements determined to throw out Spanish control and exploitation. The planter **Acacio Mañe Ela** became the father of the independence cause when, around 1950, he founded the **Crusade for the Liberation of Equatorial Guinea (CNLGE)**. Throughout the 1950s, he quietly spread his movement throughout the Continental Province. While Mañe was far from a direct threat to the colony, Governor **Faustino Ruíz González** reacted ruthlessly, employing the *Guardia Civil* to murder the farmer. Other independence activists took the hint; within the year, hundreds had fled across the borders to the newly independent countries of Gabon and the Federal Republic of Cameroon. If the ethnic ties between the Fang people of Río Muni were not justification enough for the Gabonese and Cameroonian leadership to assist the Equaguinean exiles, the United States' involvement soon gave them plenty more. The State Department's African Affairs Bureau recognized that the Equaguinean independence movement could prove a useful tool for discomfiting the Iberian Union if such action ever proved necessary. Thus, the CNLGE evolved into the **Popular Idea for Equatorial Guinea (IPGE)** under the leadership of **Nkuna Ndongo**. 

The windfall of foreign support soon gave way to difficulties for the independence movement. The IPGE was headquartered in Ambam, Cameroon, under the official patronage of President Paul Soppo Priso; their official program called for the eventual integration of Equatorial Guinea into the country. President Priso was not the only actor with a legitimate claim to leadership over the country, however. The UPC had been fighting for an independent and free Cameroon since French rule, and by the early 1950s, they had started to make serious headway in claiming control in the country's interior. While the IPGE relied on Yaoundé, some within the movement held strong sympathies for the UPC. Under pressure from Priso, **Atanasio Ndongo Miyone** led his faction into a second exile, this time to Ghana;  President Kwame Nkrumah, a friend of the UPC himself, welcomed them. In Accra, Miyone's IPGE exiles reformed into the **National Movement for the Liberation of Equatorial Guinea (MONALIGE)**. They, too, called for federation with Cameroon, but the Cameroon they had in mind was not Soppo Priso's but Moumié's. The only national movement that has not endorsed federation with Cameroon is **Bonifacio Ondó Edú's Union de Guinea Ecuatorial (UGE),** based in Libreville and backed by the Aubame government there. 

With such a tangled web of visions for Equatorial Guinea's future, and so many outside forces at play, it is hard to imagine that the issue will be resolved quickly or cleanly. No matter what, it can be assumed that Madrid will not countenance the loss of one of its last colonies so easily, and that the murder of Mañe is merely a taste of what it is prepared to do to prevent such an occurrence.

Writing this in English, but can do Dutch as well. Last year some time around summer I posted here on Reddit about how hard it can be to find real friendships in the Netherlands (coming from a a Dutch male 32 years old living in the Netherlands again since 2019), and ended up getting so many responses.

Just only searching for posts with ""friends"" in [r/Utrecht](https://www.reddit.com/r/Utrecht/) goes to show how big the issue is for many of us, and many of you shared that you were feeling the same as me: whether you’d just moved here or had been living here for years, building a genuine social circle here just felt... surprisingly difficult. That post made me realise how common this feeling actually is, and it led to something much bigger than I expected.

That’s why I started building PlusOnes: a super simple app that helps people meet through small, interest-based activities. Not anything related to dating, but just real connection through shared experiences. Say for example a Sunday run in the city, a day trip to i.e. Amsterdam or Antwerp (or you name it), plyaing arcade games at Gamestate, or a taal cafe on the Language Cafe Utrecht on a night out, it’s all about finding someone to go with, and making those everyday moments more fun together.

We quietly launched then app for Android in late April, and for iPhone in May. And even though it’s only been a bit more than a month, things have really taken off:

* 3,000+ people have already downloaded the app
* Over 500 activities have been created and filled
* Almost 3000 people followed our [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/plusonesapp/) 
* And we’re seeing real friendships form every single week

We started in Amsterdam (not even sure if I am allowed to share that on the Utrecht reddit haha :D), but now see people joining from Rotterdam, Eindhoven, Utrecht, The Hague and many other places!

\--> i.e. [coffee & walk at Ohoj](https://api.plusonesapp.com/activity?activityid=318&hostId=13) in Utrecht tomorrow!

For me personally, it’s been a total game changer. I’ve met so many new people through this and I see the same happening for others in the group. That’s why I wanted to share this back here again: because this has really been built by Reddit people, and it's now growing far beyond that. I’d love to welcome more of you into the community.

If you’re curious, feel free to message me, or just check it out in the App Store, or Google Play.

Yes, there are still so many things we can do better with the app, but all in all just super happy we've officially gotten started! Feedback? Let me know!

Please help.,"So, let me mention all the important parts in brief. Saw a girl checking me out. Found her cute. Wanted to ask her out from past few days. Sat beside her yesterday (I arrived early and she sat next to me). Initiated a small and polite conversation regarding accademics and after the class was over, again I initiated conversation, which went nice. Wanted to ask her out yesterday but couldn't do it. Today also I arrived early and sat in that position only but today it was congested, she came and sat in the back row. 
After today's class was over, I waited for her outside, she arrived late. I am presuming that she diverted her way today for going to the same place, i.e. her pg (could be because of me or couldn't be). I mustered up courage and DID IT.

I approached her calmly, she said ""will talk to you in 2 minutes papa"" and I initiated the conversation. ""Can I talk to you for 2 minutes. Then... I was wondering whether you would care joining me for a cup of coffee on one those fine days. Naturally, it would be fine if you decline ""(I am not sure whether she heard this part or not, but she told that she is going to her hometown). Then I said that she can take her time, and think about it. Then I asked her politely ""I hope this wasn't creepy"", she replied ""no, it wasn't"".

Now, I don't mind if she is going to decline or accept or this itself is a rejection. That's completely her decision and I would respect whatever that is.

This post is to seek clarity on what should I do next 😭..

1. I usually sit in the front row and was sitting at back just to strike conversation with her. Should I revert back to my original place of sitting, gradually or like from tomorrow onwards. (I am thinking if I do it suddenly she might think I was sitting at the back just for getting the opportunity to ask her out. So, please clarify)

2. If we meet coincidentally or like she is in my vicinity or like in general what should my approach be? Should I politely greet or rather do not initiate any interaction expecting that it would be too pushy.

Please everyone help me out 😭😭.
BTW, This was the first time I asked someone out , and hence I am facing this much anxiety.

We had 3 staff members so we shifted nights where 1 staff could camp away from the group to be able to have a peaceful night of sleep.

I set up my tent at the top of a hill while the rest of the group was camping on a beach.

That night I walked up the hill and went in my tent. An animal made a noise outside of my tent and I froze. It was like a low growl. That night I felt and heard something circling my tent for hours. The moon was bright and I saw the shadow of an animal with a long tail going past one side of my tent. I never stuck my head out of the tent to see it something was actually out there, or if it was my imagination.

I was up until 6am and it was bright enough, and the birds were chirping loud enough that I finally was able to fall asleep.

Then at 10am another staff member came to wake me up and I told them what happened and we just had to continue on with our trip like nothing happened.

I thought I was okay, and I slept in a tent for the next 2 months. I would have very realistic dreams of cougars circling my tent again and attacking me when I would step out. But I kept going.

Then when I went home and started trying to sleep in my own bed, I would close my eyes and then I'd be back in my tent and I would feel the same fear I had on the night the cougar circled my tent.

It got worse as time went on, and so I went to a counsellor for PTSD, and I wrote this very long essay about why I think this experience affected me in the way it did.

I also talk about growing up with my dad who had Parkinson's. He was diagnosed a year before I was born, and died a few years before this cougar incident.

I'm sharing because it's been 5 years since I wrote this, and I'm in a much better place now. It was interesting to find this again and I thought maybe others would find it interesting as well.

\-----------------------------------------------------

**Why did it happen?**

I think it happened from a fear that I was going to die. I believed that the cougar would attack me while I was in the tent and I was helpless. I left my defences at the other campsite(bear spray), that may or may not have helped me, but it gave me a sense of safety. I was thinking of the last moments with my family, friends and pets, and thinking of how they would react and live their life without me. I was thinking of the teen campers and my co-workers discovering a horrific scene and how traumatizing that would be. The fact that I felt responsible for a bunch of other young people, and I was in that situation added to it. 

Two things I think contributed to why I reacted as badly as I did. 

* An unhealthy relationship with death
* Not feeling like I have personal safety 

From a young age I’ve lost a lot of people in my life. My parents, aunts, uncles, grandparents, friends, and other relatives. My dad was sick his whole life, and my aunt would often tell us when she was drunk and looking to upset us that he was going to die any day now. She used to say that when we were little children, far before his illness got to its worst stage. Maybe as a reaction to her brother being sick, and then the alcohol amplified her horrible traits. She used to say it to hurt us if we misbehaved or were angry at him.

I used to think when I was in elementary school that when my dad died, I'd go join him in heaven, because he was the only good person in my life. I didn’t know what that meant fully as a kid, and being raised religious glorifies death, not as an end, but as a new beginning. If my dad died while I was a younger teenager, I do wonder if I would still be alive. The feeling of following him didn’t end until I was 19, and had a bit more motivation in my life and saw a path for myself. 

He had a few experiences with almost dying when I was young, and one experience where he died for a couple minutes while in a heart bypass surgery. One of the “near death” experiences was when he was taking a bath. His medication made him hyper and move around erratically. And if he wasn’t medicated he would be frozen, unable to even smile. So he was in the bath, and I don’t know why we let him lock the door behind him. He was still very insistent on his own personal freedom at this point, and it was always a fight to get him to let us help him. I was sitting in my room and I had a bad feeling that something was wrong. (This is important to remember). That “bad feeling” led me to go to the bathroom door and ask if everything was okay. No response. “Are you okay?” No response. “If you don’t answer me now, I am kicking down the door.” No response, so I kick down the door, to find him face down in the bath tub moving erratically and barely pushing himself up. I grab him and get his head out of the water and start yelling for help. I hear my brother rush down the stairs and my uncle running in. They help me get him up and out completely. 

When I got to leave the situation I felt absolutely disgusted and sick. I went to sit down in the living room and after my dad was out and safe, everyone went back to their own rooms, no talking about what just happened. My uncle was angry, that was his typical reaction to anything though. I’m just sitting there shaking, not expecting someone to come in, but wanting some type of comfort. My dad came in and sat across the room, and told me I saved his life. I responded “I didn’t want to do that.” Not meaning that I wanted him to die, but more that I didn’t want to be in that situation. This happened when I was approx. 13 years old but I didn’t talk about it to anyone until I was in my 20’s. 

This story also leads into my second thought to why I reacted the way I did the night with the cougar. It’s hard to have a sense of personal safety when it feels like everything is always going wrong and there’s nothing I can do to fix the situation. 

When I was around 7 years old, I sat in my dad’s room by his bed while he was trying to fall asleep. He would do the same for me when I was not feeling good. I remember his one hand was shaking quite a bit, and I grabbed it and held it tightly and kept putting good thoughts into it. It stopped shaking pretty soon after doing it, and I thought to myself “I have found the answer!” That led me to thinking I could actually help him get better, and was pretty disappointed when I found out I wasn’t a preacher with magical healing abilities. This led to me feeling pretty hopeless down the road. I started to fear having my own body betray me like his did to him. There were times, when things reached a breaking point, I felt like I was also frozen. When he was going to the hospital, I refused to go and when they left the house, I tried to get up but I felt like something was pushing me down and keeping me from sitting up. At the time, I thought it was my dead mother punishing me for not being a good daughter. 

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is a break I took from writing for a few days... starting again now:

I just wanted to stop because I felt that I was going off topic and starting to feel too bad. I tend to go down in a spiral and just ramble and feel bad about myself.

I left this for maybe too long and I am not sure what to write. I feel like I’ve just lost a lot of motivation to do this. I was starting to feel worse about everything and then wondering if this is even worth doing and that I’ve been feeling not good for such a long time that this is just normal and how will anything change at this point.

But I will do it anyway because I need to force myself to be more positive and even if I can change a little bit for the better it would be good. Or as long as I can not go downhill any more than it would be okay. 

I need to go back to the situation with the bathtub, as I didn’t finish why I thought it was a reason for why this night with the cougar affected me in the way it did. 

I mentioned that I had a bad feeling and that led me to finding him face down in the tub. 

One day I had my uncle pick me up from downtown because I had to go to the hospital for my checkup after breaking my toe. B, a family friend, picked me up with R, my uncle. We decided to drive around a bit and pick up a coffee. While we were driving around I had a bad feeling, and I told B that I wanted to go home. I was feeling bad, and physically sick. We went back home and I had to sit outside in the yard because I just felt exhausted and horrible. I go inside and I hear R and B in the other room and I know something is wrong so I immediately dial 911, and before I go in the other room to see what's actually happening I tell the operator that I think my dad is dead. I go in there and he is in fact dead, blue in the face and gone. I am feeling bad and like I am able to see everything again as I write this so no more. 

The whole point of this was that I had a feeling both times with these bad experiences. And my dad always said I was very intuitive.

The night of the cougar, when I was walking up the hill, I felt like something was watching me and I felt like there was something wrong. So I hurried up the hill into my tent and didn’t want to leave it to even brush my teeth. So I played some music, and tried to settle in for the night. But obviously I didn’t go to bed. I sometimes wonder if having that “feeling” is a trigger for me to panic.

Now since the incident, I notice that I get this feeling of dejavu, which leads me to think something bad is going to happen. I could be doing anything, and I will suddenly feel “oh I lived this, or I dreamed about this. And I’m convinced that the next thing that will happen will be something terrible. Nothing terrible has happened but I still feel like something will. I have other theories for why it doesn’t happen this time, that maybe in a different timeline or universe it DOES happen, and I’m still waiting for “my time”. I am not really rational during these times. It’s like I am doing everything to convince myself that I should be anxious.

My second idea for why this happened was personal safety.

I don’t know how else to go about this, after the story about my dad and how I couldn’t cure his Parkinson’s by holding his hand. I think it serves as a good example for how I’ve been feeling for a long time. Just that I don’t have any control over anything, and watching how his body betrayed him as he lost control over something where he slowly died piece by piece, until he physically died. 

In the tent I felt powerless, and that I couldn’t do much to help myself. I felt regret that I left my bear spray down at the other campsite. I made the best plan I could think of, but it didn’t feel like enough and I genuinely thought that it could be the last moments I could’ve lived.",1,1753470291.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,1.0,False

Please help.,"Before you brush me off and say I'm just trying to be scary or something, please do know that I have no reason to do that. I'm only writing this because I just want to know if someone else has experienced something similar.

For months now, I have been in a terrible mental state. I work at a night shift customer service where I take rapid consecutive calls from angry and rude people for 9 hours every day, along with a few part time jobs during the weekend. My shift starts at 9 PM and ends at 5 AM in the morning, however, this tends to vary. And during the day, I have to go to college at 9 AM to 5 PM. I have to work really hard because I'm always behind rent and I have a few loans I have to pay off, not to mention I have to pay for my college tuition. I only get two to three hours of sleep almost every day, five hours if I'm lucky. I drink a lot of coffee, and I basically use my free time to study instead of actually sleeping for my exams.

My stress levels were so bad that I tend to have high blood pressure and I have fainted on two separate occasions. There were times I sort of just zone off and forget things, and overall just feeling really soft, as if I feel really light and my legs were wobbly.

Now, it was all bad, but I was used to the heavy stress, until this certain something that happened one night. I came home at around 7 PM from college, stressed and exhausted as always, took off my shoes, and lied down on my bed and just stared at the ceiling, I wanted to just lie down for 30 minutes because I still have an essay to work on and a shift to go to at 9 PM. I was fighting back the urge to sleep really hard, until I felt someone flick my toe. I looked down, and I swear, for a split-second, I saw my grandfather peeking from my footboard and then drop down as if to hide out of my view. My grandfather has been dead for 10 years. I immediately jumped out of my bed, completely terrified, and there's nobody there, I was alone. My legs were aching and I was struggling to even walk, but I forced myself to get out of my apartment room and go to the lobby where a lot of people are. I looked awful and I swear people could tell I looked really sick or something. I called my friend over and asked if I could stay at her place for a bit.

At that point, I was so terrified that I kept sobbing and stuttering when my friend asked what was wrong with me while she drove me to her place, I straight up told her what happened, and I could tell she couldn't believe me, but all she did was tell me to calm down. I wasn't thinking of the essay or work, I only kept thinking about what I just experienced. I expected to not be able to sleep anymore after this out of pure shock and terror, but my friend gave me food and drink. I stayed at her couch in her living room and asked her to stay awake for me and stay in the living room with me, I was so terrified of being alone that I want someone to be near me at all times. Eventually, I fell asleep with her awake by side, watching TV with all of the lights on. It was the longest, and dare I say best, sleep I've ever had. I missed two shifts and one class because of how long I slept. Because of this I became more of a workaholic because I'm scared of being alone in my apartment, I wanted to be in places with a lot of people and be able to to do something to not think about it. I'm about to seek therapy because of this and resign from my job. Does anyone have an explanation for this? Was that hallucination?",1,1753470240.0,mentalhealth,1,1.0,False

1m97upw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Solopreneur2Brand/comments/1m97upw/basics_for_buying_a_small_business/,Basics for buying a small business,"Buying a small business sounds glamorous shark tank pitches, working for yourself, maybe even rolling up to your new shop with a coffee and big plans. But the actual process? It’s way less “Silicon Valley,” way more “let’s dig through spreadsheets and find out why this ice cream shop is for sale for only $15k.”

So here’s what you actually need to know before you buy.



**1. Figure Out Why It’s for Sale**

The listing says “owner retiring.” Maybe. Or maybe the business is tanking because there’s a Starbucks moving in next door. Your job: be a detective. Ask hard questions. “Why are you really selling?” If you smell BS, don’t ignore it. If everything checks out, great. If not, walk.



**2. Don’t Fall for the Listing**

Everyone selling a business acts like it’s the next Chipotle. They’ll brag about “potential” and “established customer base.” Ignore the hype. Focus on facts: actual profits, real customer numbers, how much work is involved, and what’s actually included in the sale (inventory, website, customer list, etc.).



**3. Look Under the Hood (Finances)**

Get the financials. Not just “here’s last year’s revenue.” You want tax returns, profit and loss statements, debts, leases everything. If the seller gets cagey, that’s a red flag. Even better: have an accountant (ideally one who knows small business) look over the numbers and tell you what’s real.



**4. Know What You’re Really Buying**

You’re not just buying a logo and a Facebook page. Are you getting equipment? The lease? Vendor contracts? Intellectual property? Sometimes you buy a business and realize you don’t even own the domain name. Spell out everything in writing.



**5. Watch Out for Hidden Skeletons**

Is the landlord about to double the rent? Are there old debts or lawsuits lurking? Are there angry customers ready to trash you on Yelp as soon as you take over? Talk to employees, customers, and suppliers if you can. Google the business. Seriously, due diligence saves you.



**6. What’s It Really Worth?**

Rule of thumb: small businesses often sell for 2-3x their annual profits (not revenue). But every deal is different. If it’s a dying business, it might be worth just the value of equipment. If it’s thriving, the price will reflect that. Don’t get emotional walk if the numbers don’t make sense.



**7. Think About the Transition**

Will the current owner help train you? Will customers stick around after the handoff? Buying a business is less like buying a used car and more like adopting someone’s pet. Relationships, knowledge, and trust matter.



**8. Don’t Skip the Legal Stuff**

You need a lawyer. Not your cousin who “knows about contracts” a real business attorney. Get a proper purchase agreement, make sure licenses and permits transfer, and protect yourself from old debts.



**9. Have a Plan for Day One**

Don’t just “take over and see what happens.” Know what you’ll keep, what you’ll fix, and how you’ll announce the change to customers. (Spoiler: they don’t want the business to turn into something unrecognizable overnight.)



**TL;DR:**

Buying a small business can be amazing or a nightmare if you skip the basics. Do your homework, trust your gut, and remember: it’s better to walk away than get stuck with someone else’s problem child.

https://preview.redd.it/s5gkhpfofs061.jpg?width=2064&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c175eb97f2ac90ce1058d2578c321ac507fab89f

Starting the keto diet can be a little overwhelming-the high-fat, low-carb diet, known for its dramatic weight loss results, requires an overhaul of most people's typical shopping lists. That means saying goodbye to some of the easy items you might keep on hand for lazy nights (we're talking to you, quick-cooking rice and frozen french fries), and hello to some slightly more perishable foods that are higher in fat and protein like meat and full-fat dairy. 

But before you go filling your grocery cart with bacon and cheese galore, know that you'll want to opt for good-for-you sources of unsaturated fat and protein-like fish and avocado, instead, says Lyssie Lakatos, RDN, of the Nutrition Twins. ""Since this diet is primarily coming from fat, choosing healthy sources of fat is important,"" she says. So, healthy fat = good; protein = good; but what about everything else? Don't freak-while, yes, tons of stuff is off-limits on the keto diet, there are plenty of yummy things you can eat. To help, a few dietitians weighed in on what they'd put on their keto diet grocery shopping list-so all you really have to do is save it and go to the store.  But first. . . some items to take off your list

There are a few aisles you can skip (the cookie aisle is probably one of them) if you're committing to keto. Here are the non-keto-friendly items you will no longer need to stock your fridge and pantry with. 

Pasta and other grains When you're cutting carbs on keto, pasta, rice, and noodles have to be the first to go (unfortunately). Your local grocery store might have a special health foods section where you can find low-carb or gluten-free pastas and noodles, though. 

Starchy veggiesPotatoes are off limits, and so are other starchy, high-carb vegetables like carrots, believe it or not. Colorful, leafy greens are going to be key staples to add to your basket or cart. 

High-sugar fruitsWhile fruit is something that is usually recommended for a healthy, balanced diet, the keto diet restricts some fruit, says Marisa Moore, MBA, RDN, LD.  Some fruits, like apples, bananas, and pears, are higher in carbs, which break down into sugars, so they're not typically part of a keto eating plan. 

LegumesIf you eat vegan or vegetarian, certain legumes, like beans, lentils, and chickpeas, might be a regular part of your diet for extra protein. On keto, though, they're too high in carbs and too low in fat to be compliant. 

Sugary foodsYou're going to want to bypass any aisle that includes candy, doughnuts, snack cakes, and cookies, as the sugars in any processed sweets should be avoided on the keto diet. Your keto-friendly grocery list

Ok, now that we've gotten the bad news out of the way, here are all the yummy items you can stock up on when you're following a keto diet. There's plenty to be excited about putting in your cart!

Low-carb veggies

Not all vegetables are created equal for keto followers. High-carb veggies are a no-go. Instead, opt for low-carb options like cauliflower, broccoli, spinach, bell pepper, celery, cucumber, eggplant, and asparagus, says Pegah Jalali, RD, a nutritionist with Middleberg Nutrition. 

Frozen veggies are cool, too. Sydney Greene, RD, also of Middleberg Nutrition, recommends frozen cauliflower in particular. ""It's very low carb yet high in fiber and vitamin C. Use cauliflower in place of bananas for a creamy smoothie without the extra carbohydrates,"" Greene says. 

Avocados

Tammy Lakatos Shames, RDN, of Nutrition Twins, describes avocados as one of the very best keto foods, jam-packed with both nutrients and healthy fats. ""I like to have them with some hemp or flax seeds sprinkled on top and some parmesan cheese,"" says Jalali.  

Berries 

Raspberries are a perfect sweet treat for people on the keto diet, since they're the fruit with the fewest carbs, says Jalali-though blueberries and blackberries are great, too. Blackberries and raspberries specifically are a solid option because they contain 8 grams of fiber per cup, too, Moore adds. Salad greens

Pre-washed greens, like spinach, kale and arugula, are a huge timesaver. ""Having greens on hand makes it super easy to throw together a quick salad or add some quick nutrients-folate, vitamin C, fiber, magnesium-to your proteins,"" says Greene. 

For a quick, keto-friendly breakfast, Greene suggests scrambling two whole eggs and a handful of spinach to get a good serving of healthy fat, protein, and fiber. 

Grass-fed beef and organic chicken

Keep grass-fed beef and lamb, along with organic chicken, on hand, recommends Jalali. ""Our clients particularly love Applegate's Great Organic Uncured Beef Hot Dog,"" says Shames-they're non-GMO and made with grass-fed beef, sans nitrates and preservatives. 

Bone broth

Another option? Sip your meat-based protein. Greene loves Bonafide Provisions Bone Broth, which uses bones from grass-fed cows. ""The amino acids found in the broth support a healthy gut,"" says Greene. Tuna, salmon, or sardines (fresh or canned)

If you opt for fresh fish, grill, bake, or pan-fry it in a healthy oil (olive or avocado) and serve with a low-carb veggie like broccoli or cauliflower rice. 

If you choose canned, mix it with mayo and serve over greens, suggests Jalali. For a simple keto lunch, Greene suggests combining a can of tuna with half an avocado in a collard green wrap. 

Cheese

Go for grass-fed, organic, and full-fat options in the dairy aisle, recommends Jalali. For cheese, one easy-to-find option-readily available at groceries and convenience stores alike-is Organic Valley's full fat cheese. ""It fits in the keto diet perfectly,"" says Lakatos. Always read the nutrition info before purchasing pre-shredded cheeses, cautions Jalali, who says they sometimes contain a stabilizer that adds carbs-so just make sure your shredded cheese has zero grams of carbs. 

Greek yogurt and sour cream

These can be used interchangeably on the keto diet, as they all have similar amounts of carbs-Greek yogurt has five grams per serving and sour cream has seven. Just make sure they're plain options-added flavors also add carbs. 

Quark

Quark is a German food that's somewhere in between yogurt and cheese in flavor and consistency-you can add it to smoothies, or use it as a spread or topping. ""It's rich, creamy, and a favorite among our clients who are keto followers,"" says Lakatos. 

Eggs

If you're on a keto diet, opt for Eggland's Best Eggs, says Lakatos. ""They have double the omega-3s and six times the vitamin D of other eggs, thanks to their all-vegetarian hen feed which provides high-quality, keto-friendly nutrients. ""

Moore suggests meal prepping hard boiled eggs and keeping them in the fridge throughout the week for easy on-the-go breakfasts. If properly refrigerated and not cracked, they'll last for 7 days in the fridge. 

Nut milks

Milk can actually have a good amount of carbs, so nut milk is a good alternative on the keto diet, says Lakatos. Unsweetened coconut, hemp, and almond milks in particular are good options, as they contain no carbs and more than four grams of fat-a perfect combo for keto dieters. Almond milk specifically is versatile for a variety of recipes, like a chia seed pudding or a breakfast smoothie, says Moore. ""Simply blend frozen berries with leafy greens and plenty of almond milk for a frosty drink in less than five minutes,"" Moore suggests. 

Avocado, olive, hazelnut, and coconut oil

The keto diet is all about fat, so clearly all healthy oils are welcome on this keto grocery list. Cooking food in the oils is one thing-but you can also amp up your fat intake by drizzling some oil on your cooked meal, as well. 

Grass-fed ghee

Ghee, like the oils above, is a pure fat, which means its free from carbs or protein, says Jalali. ""Ketogenic diets are more than 60 percent fat so having pure fats for all meals helps keep you on track,"" she says. If you can't find ghee, you can also use butter. 

Seaweed

This low-carb snack has just one gram of carbs, and is full of iodine, which supports a healthy thyroid, says Greene. Some even come in individual grab-and-go packets so you can store them in your desk at work or in your purse. 

Olives

You can add olives to salad or have them as an on-the-go snack. ""We find these to be a lifesaver for our keto clients,"" says Shames. Olives offer a healthy monounsaturated source of fat; some even come in different flavors (like taco or sriracha). Pistachios 

Shames recommends single-serving packages of pistachios, too. ""Ninety percent of the fats found in pistachios are the better-for-you mono- and polyunsaturated type,"" says Shames. ""Plus, pistachios provide a good source of plant protein and fiber for a trio that can help to keep you fuller longer. ""

Almonds

Another nut that's high in fiber, healthy fat, and protein is almonds. Moore always recommends them as snacks for clients who are constantly busy and need snacks to keep them satiated throughout the day. You can easily pack single-serve packages ahead of time. 

Nutritional yeast

Nutritional yeast provides B12, a nutrient that many of us-especially vegans and vegetarians-just don't get enough of. It's also a source of protein without many carbs at all, says Lakatos. 

""Keto followers can sprinkle it on their meals for a cheesy flavor and they often use it to make keto-friendly breads and tortillas,"" says Lakatos. 

Chia seeds and flax seeds

You can use these seeds to coat meats, include them in bake goods, or make keto-friendly oatmeal and pudding, says Jalali. These pantry items are high in fiber, but low in carbs. 

Healthy frozen foods

Added items like frozen cauliflower pizza and frozen frittatas can make eating keo simple on mornings and nights when you're strapped for time. Nora Minno, an RD in New York City, loves this pizza, which contains only 16 grams of carbs for the whole pie.  Tofu

""Tofu is a great way to add plant-based protein into a diet that is typically heavy in animal protein and fat,"" says Minno. ""A 3-oz serving contains 80 calories, 4 grams of fat, 9 grams of protein and only 3 grams of carbs. You'll also be getting important micronutrients like calcium, iron, and potassium. ""

Low-carb pasta alternatives

""Shiratake noodles are a great low-carb pasta alternative with only 2 grams of carbs and 0 calories per bag,"" says Minno. 

Nut butter

A high-quality nut butter is a great keto snack, topping for flax crackers, and ingredient for keto fat bombs and desserts, says Lara Clevenger, RD and founder of The Keto Queens. 

Grass-fed beef tallow

Beef tallow is rich in omega 3 and CLA and is a ""high quality saturated fat which has a high smoke point and is great for cooking,"" says Clevenger. 

Chocolate

Yes, you can totally add chocolate to your shopping cart on the keto diet! Clevenger recommends Choc Zero. ""It's sugar-free chocolate, non-gmo, and contains no sugar alcohols or soy lecithin. It's not super bitter like some chocolate bars and tastes great and has a very good texture,"" she says. 

Keto-approved condiments

One of the trickiest things to shop for while keto? Dressings and condiments. Clevenger recommends low-sugar ketchup and BBQ sauce from Alterna Sweets. ""These sauces taste amazing and they all contain only 1 gram net carb per tablespoon,"" she says. As for salad dressing? Clevenger reaches for Primal Kitchen brand. ""These are sugar-free and keto-certified. ""Alternative flours

""Almond flour is one of my favorite baking ingredients,"" Moore says. It's also one of the most common keto-friendly, gluten-free, alternative flours.  ""The almonds provide satiating fiber and protein plus healthy fats,"" Moore adds.  She recommends it for making pie crusts and baking cookies and muffins. 

Coconut flour is another low-carb flour alternative that Moore suggests adding to your pantry. However, keep in mind that you can't just substitute the same amount in a recipe that calls for regular four. ""Because it is highly absorbent, you'll likely need to add more liquid to baked goods that use coconut flour,"" Moore says. 

Keto-friendly sweeteners

For a natural sugar substitute that's keto-compliant, consider stocking up on monk fruit, says Moore. Whether you're baking or looking to sweeten up your coffee, monk fruit is an option that won't take you out of ketosis. Erythritol is another common keto-friendly sugar substitute. Again, you'll want to use in keto-specific recipes since you can't swap in the same amount for a recipe that calls for sugar. 

Keto protein bars

To keep you full during the day, try a keto protein or energy bar that's high in healthy fats (like nuts and oils like avocado oil) and protein, but low in carbs. Keto Bar is a great option-they make a delicious chocolate peanut butter flavor. 

Keto granolas

You won't be able to buy regular cereals, as they'll be too high in carbs, but low-carb or grain-free, low sugar granolas like Lakanto Healthy Quick Breakfast Granola or Lark Ellen Farm Granola are a better choice. You can add milk to them or eat them with yogurt and breakfast is solved.",1,1753470032.0,HealthyZapper,0,1.0,False

1m97qa5,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1m97qa5/i_hate_my_mother/,i hate my mother,"Took way too long to piece this together. For context, each has a different set narcissistic qualities, however she has been telling me awful things about him even before pre-K, and now I realize that she’s…. so much worse? 

She told me that I have to take care of her when she’s old. Makes sense, but recently I mentioned that I’d love to have a choice or take turns with my brother to take care of them both rather than be defaulted arbitrarily because I’m a girl. This woman flipped out because “we made a deal” when I was 8? Over braces? And way too young to be hearing so much about their messy ass divorce and being her messenger/therapist golden girl. A massive part of my childhood was spent isolated or seeing her dissociating and dad drunk followed by either one yelling at me to shut up when I cried from my brother beating me up and telling me how little I’m worth. Their reactions at the time very much seemed to justify both what he was saying and doing. 

She still drinks and ignores me if I try to talk to her. I know she doesn’t love me in any authentic or unconditional sense that is characteristic of mothers. And I don’t know what to do when she hugs me, which thankfully is rare. Of course, she publicly acts like we’re besties, but i feel sick every time a relative or stranger says I look like her. She loves it. 

I have to try not to laugh when she pretends to be perfect by baking, cleaning, and being generally affectionate when my brother visits. She hasn’t for me in 5+ years, yet makes me share every meal I pay for and cook, then consistently only dirties my clean dishes rather than doing her own. My mom is a lazy and very aggressive know-it-all, which turns even the most silly of fun facts into screaming “No, you’re wrong! I don’t need to look it up. I already know!” and I’ve never heard even the most half-assed apology even when she is wrong and the doubling-down is worse if there’s proof. 

My mom gets deeply hurt if I don’t want to watch her shows, yet complains nonstop if when i finally get to pick, so now she whines that I don’t spend time with her. I haven’t watched TV in a month because from 6am-12am Jabba is on the couch; I’d love a little privacy, though I know asking for it is the same as asking for a fight. I’m usually tired and like the screen break so whatever. Every invite to go walk, get coffee, or clean together she will straight up pretend she can’t hear me. I know this person is lonely, but lol obviously not for me. I’d be okay with all of that if she could admit it. Instead, my mother tells me my feelings are inhuman, that I’m a robot. However, it changes quickly to “You’re too sensitive. Normal people don’t feel the way that you do. What’s wrong with you?” 

When I moved away I stopped intensely hating myself and wanting to not live at times, figuring mountains won over the beach or something. Then again, what’s not to like about a sudden shortage of rude comments on my clothes, hair, food? Now Mother’s day cards are impossible because I know I have to pretend. I tend to also plan a little brunch and get her a small gift while my brother shows up uninvited and empty-handed, though he makes good money, and leaves before the check comes. She whines about how unappreciated she feels and as much as I understand, I can’t realistically help beyond my own hands. I don’t make much, especially compared to her but I still pay rent, take out the trash, do all the cooking and cleaning and she still yells at me when I get home from work to do more… with deadlines. I can’t even tell her I’m also going back to school soon, because rather than being neutral or supportive, she will be genuinely upset that i didn’t take her suggestion to apply to her miserable workplace as an expectation with commitment when all I said is “that’s cool, maybe.” 

I used to love and even defend her but now it feels like brainwashing. Upon reflection, I hate how this person makes me feel and I am excitedly waiting to be in a position to never have to talk to her again. I knew before if I had kids that I couldn’t bring them around my family, but now I think I can’t even be around them. Others give me hope that later on I’ll have a chance to make my own because quite simply the family that made me had no business in doing so. My attachment style is deeply disorganized from all the damn charades I’m almost convinced don’t want/need love anymore. Not like this, anyway. 

I want a roommate and can afford to move out. The problem is she expects me to help her with rent until December, which she obv didn’t didn’t mention until I was crying packing after another big stupid fight over her using a slur and playing Schrödinger’s AH when I said “oh. that wasn’t funny” (it wasn’t). Hugely tempted to leave her hanging tbh :/

Sorry quite a long rant. I’m just trying to process my emotions maybe, but wonder if other people dealt with similar instances? Is there hope to getting away? Other than generally feeling sad for her, am I wrong for not feeling anything remotely positive for the person who gave me life? ",2,1753469939.0,raisedbynarcissists,3,1.0,False

How do you cultivate a sense of ""home"" when you know you won't be staying put for long? I've found that focusing on sensory details helps a lot. Bringing my own bedding, even if it's just a familiar pillowcase, makes teh bed feel more like my own. Scent is another powerful tool – a specific candle or essential oil diffuser can instantly create a comforting and consistent atmosphere.

Beyond that, personalizing the space, even temporarily, goes a long way. Putting up a few prints or photos with removable adhesive strips can make a big difference. Establishing a routine, like having a designated spot for my morning coffee or evening reading, also adds a sense of normalcy and belonging.

I've been an RMT for 10 months or so and I've been having progressive pain/weakness in my left wrist (although, I did experience a similar pain when I was going through school approx 2 years ago but just thought it was due to acclimating to massage). I have a hard/bony end feel with wrist flexion with the restriction happening somewhere by radius/scaphoid/lunate but x-ray came back fine (I live in Ontario so it will be several months - a year before I can get an MRI). I just got back from seeing a sports med doctor and their best guess from their assessment is that I have a TFCC sprain and/or ECU strain. I was slightly surprised but in active and passive flexion (slightly beyond end feel), I have pain by the ulnar side of my wrist (mostly voler/palmer side). No pain with palpation though, no pain with radial or ulnar deviation. Decreased strength with elbow and wrist flexion with forearm supination as well as elbow flexion and neutral wrist/forearm when grasping an object. Watson's was negative. I also have a lot of pain in dorsal lunate if wrist is flexed and something taps it (lightly bonked it on the coffee table and almost crawled out of my skin). I also have median nerve involvement and ulnar nerve involvement (the latter of which has been the case on and off for a couple years since a whiplash injury, but doc thinks it was from TOS from pec minor impingement but did not have that issue before a compressive trauma to neck). My chiropractor advised that I have hypermobility in my trisacphoid joint and was worried about AVN (strangely, my dad has necrosis in his wrist on the radial side but doesn't remember the details of it). I have a negative ulnar varience in both wrists. I have been wearing a semi rigid wrist/thumb brace at night which I have been finding it has been making my wrist hurt more with my first client of the day and it seems like I am weaker as the day goes on vs when I wasn't wearing it. I just was fitted by a physiotherapist for a wrist widget splint and it makes my flexor carpi ulnaris so achey after wearing it for 20mins. The sports med doc said I could continue with work while wearing the widget but I'm not sure I will be able to tolerate it for 5 clients per day. I'm waiting to get connected with physio. I'm just trying to avoid having to miss time from work (can't get paid if I'm not there) and causing prolonged healing or further injury.

At my workplace, we close at 8pm, and everyday after 5pm the closer is alone and is expected to do all of the closing tasks no matter what. This sometimes leads to the closer being at the shop until 10 pm or even later because our shop is quite large. I've talked to my boss numerous times about how stressful closing is because we are in a bad area that is riddled with homelessness and crime. She always says that we can't afford two closers, which I think is bs because I know that the shop makes about $1500 per day. Not only does it feel unsafe, but the amount of work we're expected to do is kind of crazy, plus since it's a closing shift, the closer makes way less tips than everyone else because it's super slow. Therefore the closer has to do more work while making way less money. I also always get stuck doing closing shifts cause I am the only man that works there, when I do complain, I get accused of not wanting to work, and told that closing alone is normal at coffee shops, but the reason why I complain is because I've had multiple instances of insane stuff happening at the shop during these later hours. Is this normal for coffee shops? Am I being unreasonable for wanting to have more than one closer? Please let me know. I've also gone above and beyond for this coffee shop, I'm the only person who knows how to dial in espresso, even the owner has no clue how to do that, I had to learn it on my own so we don't serve bad coffee to people. Even with my extra time and effort that I put into the shop, I still get accused of not wanting to work and that I am unreasonable. Advice? She also wonders why we have such a high turnover rate, lol. ",9,1753469545.0,barista,16,0.91,False

My wife (40 yo, two kids) has gained about 50 pounds since we got married. She's not morbidly obese, but is definitely in the ""overweight"" category. Now has a large and noticeable amount of belly fat and has also gained in her face and other places.

I've become a lot less attracted to her after these changes. More importantly, I'm concerned about the health ramifications, as she has high cholesterol and a family history of heart issues as a result. I personally maintain a consistent workout regimen and try to eat as healthy as possible, so these changes are fundamentally misaligned with the lifestyle that I would like for us to establish together.

It's obviously no secret. She knows she's gained weight. She says she doesn't like it. She's been going to the gym consistently this year, but she's changed very little about her eating. She says that she has made changes to her eating, but realistically that means that she scaled back her daily coffees to 2-3 times per week. I see what she eats throughout the day and she consistently makes poor decisions; either snacking frequently, eating large portions, or getting food that has high calorie content and low nutritional value. She already meets with a therapist and I'm sure they discuss the topic, but I don't pry.

I've shared my concerns about her health and the fact that I want us to be in good shape as our kids get older. We've talked about her family history. I've started making healthy meals at home for breakfast and dinner. I've encouraged us to go on walks as a family in the evenings. At the end of the day, I can't control the decisions that she makes on her own. To me, it feels clear that it's not a priority, otherwise she'd be adjusting her eating so that she would start losing weight.

I don't know where to go from here. Bringing it up again feels like I'm beating a dead horse, but I can feel myself becoming resentful and I know that's not good either. How have you all handled this? I know that I can't force her to care about her health, but it feels like we are on opposite ends of the spectrum and I'm at a loss for how else I can help.",0,1753469525.0,AskMenAdvice,61,0.27,False

Cleveland Clinic found that viagra is associated with much lower risk of Alzheimer’s. Some blogs speculate that part of the explanation is Viagra’s ability to increase blood flow to the brain. But they caution that this is correlation only. 

If this is true, I find it puzzling that “they” continually associate coffee with lower risk of dementia, given that coffee induces 30-50% lower blood flow to the brain. 

It’s really puzzling. Is this a good reason to ditch the coffee?

1m97jtw,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1m97jtw/does_the_cuisinart_10cup_thermal_coffeemaker/,Does the Cuisinart 10-Cup Thermal Coffeemaker Deliver Consistent Brew? Honest Review,"The **Cuisinart DCC-1170BKNAS** has been my morning companion for about a month now, and using it every day has brought a mix of delight and minor frustrations. To begin with, the sleek black design combined with the thermal carafe offers a classic look that fits seamlessly into my kitchen. More importantly, it does what coffee makers are supposed to do—brew great coffee. However, it's the added features and functionality that both elevate it and present challenges. Let me share my experience with the good, the bad, and everything in between.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The overall design is solid. Featuring compact dimensions (7.97”D x 8.13”W x 14.25”H), this coffee maker makes efficient use of countertop space. The black finish and modern aesthetic certainly caught my eye on day one. Its thermal carafe, designed for a 10-cup capacity, has an ergonomic handle that doesn’t make my wrist regret pouring coffee. Plus, the drip-free spout and knuckle guard minimize mess—a huge win for clumsy mornings. That said, the machine weighs about 8 pounds, so it feels sturdy and durable rather than flimsy. The control buttons, while simple, aren’t the most intuitive for first-time users and took me a couple of days to master.  

**Ease of Use and Programming**  
This model is branded as ""programmable,"" and its 24-hour programmability has been my lifesaver. Setting it up at night so I’ve got hot coffee waiting for me at 7 AM feels like a small luxury. The 1-4 cup setting is thoughtful for those days I don’t need an entire carafe, though I did notice the brew strength slightly changes when brewing smaller quantities—coffee aficionados might pick up on this. A notable mention is the Brew Pause™ feature; yes, you *can* sneak a cup mid-cycle without creating a mess. However, the LCD clock, while functional, isn’t the easiest to read under dim lighting, and I found the self-clean functionality somewhat convoluted to activate.  

**Performance and Coffee Quality**  
The 10-cup thermal carafe is the true MVP here. It keeps coffee hot for hours without the burnt flavor that glass carafes on a warming plate often impart—a blessing for slow drinkers like me. It uses a gold-tone permanent filter and a charcoal water filter, which improves coffee taste noticeably by removing impurities. I did, however, have to experiment with grind size and coffee amounts to strike the right balance for my morning cup. If the grind is too coarse or too fine, the machine struggles, and sometimes the brew can end up weaker than anticipated.  

[Check **Cuisinart DCC-1170BKNAS** price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b096l473mk/)  

**Advantages**  
- The thermal carafe is a game-changer for preserving coffee temperature.  
- With a gold-tone permanent filter and charcoal water filter, coffee tastes cleaner and richer.  
- The 24-hour programmability lets you wake up to fresh, hot coffee every morning.  
- Its compact design doesn’t hog countertop space while still feeling robust.  

**Shortcomings**  
- The LCD screen isn’t particularly bright or easy to read under low light.  
- Brewing strength can be inconsistent depending on the grind and quantity.  
- The initial setup and programming have a slight learning curve.  

**Competing Brands**  
When comparing this coffee machine to other highly-rated models like the Breville Precision Brewer or the similar Thermal Coffee Maker by Zojirushi, a few things come to light. The Breville model provides exceptional brewing versatility with precise temperature control, but it comes at a significantly higher price point—ideal for someone who wants to geek out over coffee science. Zojirushi, on the other hand, boasts an equally strong thermal carafe but lacks programmability, which is where the Cuisinart takes the lead for convenience. While it doesn’t have the advanced brewing options found in pricier brands, it’s a reliable solution for everyday family or small office use.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
With all its features, this coffee maker feels like a solid mid-range option. The reusable filter eliminates the need for regular paper filter purchases, saving a bit in the long run. While not the cheapest coffee maker on the block, the thermal carafe and programmability make the investment worthwhile for anyone looking for longevity and convenience. Based on its performance relative to other well-known coffee machines, it strikes a fair balance between quality and cost.

I do notice a ""crash"" 2-3p ish and have resorted to afternoon coffee the last couple of days.

When I initially spoke to my psychiatrist about making the transition from Adderall to Vyvanse I asked if it would be appropriate to consider a booster as well (e.g. 40 mg of Vyvanse + 10 mg Adderall IR) based on reading across ADHD threads here. My psychiatrist said he'd never heard of doing both and has not prescribed both to any other patients though it sounds like (from Reddit at least) it is a practice for some. Is anyone aware of any medical literature I can read up on about this? Looking to educate myself and possibly have something to pass along to my doctor.

1m97hmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/thecranberries/comments/1m97hmx/did_the_cranberries_loose_their_magic_after_the/,Did The Cranberries loose their magic after the 90s?,"I discovered The Cranberries when I was 15. That was in 2004. They were the first band I discovered ""on my own""; I hadn't really been listening to music intentionally before; I just listened to whatever music was on in the background. The Cranberries were a huge discovery for me and a gateway to some other similar bands that are still some of my top 10 favorite bands (The Sundays and Sixpence None The Richer, to name two). I loved all their music, except for 'Wake up and smell the coffee'.

In the years since then, I've re-evaluated their albums and came to the conclusion that they - for me personally - lost their magic after the 90s. Both 'Everybody else is doing it...' and 'No need to argue' are stellar albums. I think of those two albums as masterpieces. Back then (and now still) I do really like 'To the faithful departed' and 'Bury the hatchet'; both those albums have some amazing songs on them, that still hold up today.

But I really feel like the band lost something after that. 'Wake up and smell the coffee' didn't do anything for me and I remember how disappointed I was when 'Roses' was released. 'Roses' was supposed to be a return to the sound of their debut album, but I just don't hear it. The songs sound so lame and genetic to me. And wtf with 'Schizophrenic playboy'? That's just awful. And though I think it was nice for fans after Dolores had passed and though they did a good job with the material they had (unfinished songs, unfinished demos, unfinished vocals), 'In the end' is just too repetitive for me to enjoy.

I always wondered... What if the band took a break after 'No need to argue'? It's a known fact Dolores was depressed when they were recording their third album, 'To the faithful departed'. She was depressed, she battled with anorexia,... I feel like, if the band took a break they would have found their spark again. Maybe their third album would have sounded a lot different. Less harsh. Though I've always liked their third and fourth album, I feel like that was some breaking point for them. I wish they had taken some time off.

What is your most avorite and least favorite Cranberries era? Do you enjoy their output after the 90s?

I was so, so sad when Dolores died. Her and the band were my musical awakening when I was a teen. But realizing I would never hear new music by The Cranberries, made me realize they hadn't released anything I actually liked after'Bury the hatchet'.",4,1753469380.0,thecranberries,1,1.0,False

As someone who usually relies on an electric coffee maker, the switch was both exciting and intimidating. The Hario V60 Ceramic Pour Over Coffee Set, model V60, promises a professional-grade coffee experience, and I didn’t hesitate to put it through its paces.

**Stylish and Functional Design**  

The aesthetics of the Hario V60 impressed me immediately. Its sleek ceramic body and crisp white finish gave off a minimalistic and clean vibe that looked great on my kitchen counter. Not just about looks, the conical shape and strategically placed ridges on the inside of the dripper serve a purpose. They help control water flow and maximize coffee extraction, which, as I discovered, really does make a difference in flavor. 

The ceramic material isn’t just there for show either—it provides excellent heat retention. I found my coffee stayed hotter for longer compared to plastic or metal options I’ve tried. That said, dropping it was something I became paranoid about, as it’s undeniably fragile.

**Ease of Use for Beginners and Pros Alike**  

With a coffee scoop, 100 paper filters, a V60 server, and the dripper itself included in this starter kit, it gives you everything needed to jump right into the pour-over game. Initially, I was unsure about measuring and pouring water with precision, but even as a novice, I quickly got the hang of it. The whole system seems designed for ease, yet it still offers the depth that coffee enthusiasts would appreciate.

The filters were effortless to set up, and the scoop provided a pretty accurate measure for coffee grounds, which saved me the trouble of guessing. I made a few errors in pouring the water too fast or unevenly at first, but figuring out the technique felt rewarding rather than frustrating.

**Advantages**  

- Ceramic body retains heat and enhances flavor consistently.  
- Sleek, modern design that elevates any countertop.
- Easy-to-use system perfect for both beginners and seasoned coffee brewers.  

**Check Hario V60 price on Amazon.**  

**Performance That Surprises**  

The key is in the process, and with the Hario V60, crafting a perfect pour-over became my morning ritual. The cone shape and larger single hole at the bottom offer unmatched control over water distribution. I noticed a fuller body and more defined flavors in my coffee than I’d ever achieved with an electric machine. 

Since it’s a size 02 dripper, you can brew anywhere from one to four cups at a time. For someone like me who occasionally shares a cup or two with friends, the flexibility is fantastic. However, I do wish the dripper had a notch or more precise markings on the server to indicate water levels more clearly.

**Build Quality and Materials**  

Let’s talk durability. While I adore the ceramic build, I worried every time I placed it near the edge of the counter. A ceramic pour-over doesn’t forgive clumsiness. On the plus side, its quality is undeniable—no chipping or cracking even after weeks of daily use and several rounds of washing. It truly feels premium and well-made, justifying its reputation as a Japanese craftsmanship staple.

The borosilicate glass coffee server that comes with the kit also deserves praise. It’s both heatproof and lightweight, and the BPA-free handle stayed cool to the touch, even when filled with piping hot coffee.

**Limitations**  

- Fragility is a concern; dropping it isn't an option.  
- Mastering the pouring technique takes some trial and error.  

**Competing Products**  

I compared the Hario V60 to other pour-over methods like the Chemex and Kalita Wave during my testing. The Chemex, for instance, has a larger capacity and doubles as a stylish artisanal carafe, but it’s somewhat bulkier and pricier. The Kalita Wave stands out with its flat-bottomed design, which takes out some of the precision needed in pouring. However, what sets the Hario V60 apart is the sheer control it offers. The conical dripper is ideal for anyone who prioritizes richness and precision in their pour-over brewing.

**Cost Efficiency**  

Although this set isn’t the cheapest brewing setup out there, especially when considering long-term costs like purchasing replacement paper filters, it strikes a balance between quality, versatility, and pricing. For what you’re getting—the dripper, server, scoop, and filters—the package feels extremely well-rounded. It’s an investment that makes sense for both coffee enthusiasts wanting a new arsenal addition and beginners eager to craft better coffee right at home.

With you, I felt seen. Understood in ways that felt almost holy. Safe, in a world where I’d only known storms. You gave me something rare. Something my past had never offered. And yet, love… love alone is not the anchor we hoped it would be.

We’re walking roads that diverge, and we both know deep down, this isn’t something built to last forever. Still, I can’t help but wonder why the universe brings two souls so close, only to remind them how far apart they truly are. Like you said… it just doesn’t make sense.

I miss you when joy finds me,
and I have no one to tell but the silence.
I miss you when the walls at home
echo with voices, and no one understands.
I miss you through the things that remind me of you.
A song, a book, your favorite coffee order.
I miss hearing about your day, your interests, your dreams, your fears. 
I miss all the nights we stayed up just to share stories before we went to bed. 
I miss you quietly, constantly, even. 
As if missing you has become
a part of my breathing.

And maybe that’s what hurts the most. Not the falling apart, but the knowing. Knowing that I’m letting go of someone I still love deeply. And that kind of goodbye… is the kind that leaves a mark. 

I can’t believe I’ll go on with my life, without you in it. 
I love you so much, even the parts you don’t like about yourself. I’ll miss you more than I remember you, my twin flame.

**AITAH for leaving my best friend’s “surprise party” early because it felt more like a roast?**

Okay, so I (24F) have this best friend, let’s call her Jenna (24F too), and we’ve been close since high school. Like, “held-my-hair-while-I-threw-up-in-the-Denny’s-bathroom” type of friends. I honestly love her, I really do. But she can be... a lot.

So anyway, she threw this little “surprise party” for me last weekend. My birthday was last Tuesday, but she insisted on celebrating Friday. She told me to dress cute, and she made it sound like it was gonna be this wholesome wine-and-charcuterie night with the girls. Sounds great, right?

Well, I show up in this cute white dress I literally bought for the occasion, hair curled, nails done, all that. I walk in and they yell surprise, but not in a “we love you” way. It was a theme party. The theme? “Dress like the birthday girl and roast her.” I kid you not.

EVERYONE was wearing versions of my go-to outfits. Messy bun, iced coffee cups, fake nails, bad parking tickets taped to their bags (okay that one kinda got me). But then they started doing fake ""toasts"" that were just jabs. Like:

“Here’s to \[my name\], who always has a 10-step skincare routine but still wakes up looking tired.”

“To \[my name\], who thinks astrology is a personality trait.”

“To \[my name\], who ghosted her gym membership but never forgets to DoorDash McFlurries at 2AM.”

Like??? Some of it was funny, I’ll admit, but after 20 minutes it just got mean. I kept smiling through it like “haha good one” but deep down I was like... damn. This wasn’t a roast with love. It was just people clowning on me for sport.

So after pretending to go to the bathroom, I grabbed my keys, quietly told Jenna “I think I’m done for the night,” and left. I didn’t cause a scene. I didn’t cry. I just left. I texted her later that I appreciated the effort, but it felt more like I was the butt of the joke, not the guest of honor.

Now Jenna’s mad and saying I embarrassed her, and that “it was just jokes,” and I’m being “too sensitive.” A few of the others messaged me saying they thought I overreacted and that it was “all in fun.” But like... isn’t a birthday supposed to feel good? Not like a Comedy Central special?

So tell me, AITAH for walking out of my own roast disguised as a birthday party?

Also for the record, I’m now officially Team “Next Year I’m Celebrating With Pizza And My Cat.”

**Fairmount1955**

*NTA. Ironic she wants to claim anything about being embarassed. That none of your ""friends"" care the humor got stale and are continuing to pile on rather than reflect, well, are they even friends or do they even like you?*

>OOP: Right?? That’s what’s been messing with my head the most. Like… if this is their idea of “fun” or “love,” I’d honestly hate to see what their version of shade looks like. I kept thinking maybe I was being too sensitive, but the fact that not one person said “hey maybe this is going too far” kinda says it all.

>It felt like I walked into a group chat where they’ve been secretly roasting me for months and accidentally read the whole thing out loud.

>Still debating if I should fade out or hit them with a group message titled “Roast This” and attach a pic of me on a solo spa weekend.

**Fairmount1955**

*I think your group chat comment is a great way to describe it. Having been a younger woman, I think many of us can learn misperceptions about what is funny and how ""roasting"" plays into relationships - or rather how it makes them unhealthy. ""I guess we don't share the same sense of humor, which is Ok. What isn't Ok is that I said I wasn't enjoying it and instead of realizing it or accepting that, you just keep invalidating what I am saying. It's disappointing."" And then your idea of ghosting may be best. The more you fight or try to explain, they will likely weaponize it and say you are so dramatic, so why give them more ammunition? Why allow yourself to be dismissed more than they have? I promise you, one of the most powerful things you can do - even though it may not seem like it - is to just stay quiet. It freaks people out and they don't know how to handle it.*

**Update - 1 days later**

Hey everyone! Wow, I did not expect this much love and support. I’ve been reading through your comments (like, obsessively tbh), and I can’t even tell you how comforting it’s been. I thought I was crazy or being “too sensitive” like Jenna said, but apparently I was just reacting like a normal human with, y’know, feelings. So THANK YOU.

So here’s what happened since I posted:

Jenna texted me. Not to apologize… but to send me a meme that said “roasting is a love language” with a laughing emoji. I left her on read because... girl. Seriously?

Later that night, one of the girls from the party (we’ll call her Becca) DM’d me and said she thought I knew about the roast. She said Jenna told everyone I was totally down for it and even “helped plan it.” I was like, WHAT?! The only thing I “planned” was the white dress I wore while being emotionally shanked by six girls in fake Uggs.

Anyway, I gently explained to Becca that nope, I was blindsided. And she immediately apologized and said she felt really bad. She even said if she’d known, she never would’ve gone along with it. So that honestly made me feel a bit better, at least one of them has a soul.

As for Jenna? Radio silence since the meme. No apology, no “hey I messed up,” nothing. So I’ve decided I’m not gonna chase people to value me. My new plan? I took a personal day, got myself a mini spa package, ate overpriced macarons, and spent my night with my cat binge-watching ""The Bear"" while wearing a gold face mask like I was healing from battle (because emotionally, I kinda was).

I’ve realized this whole thing was actually a weird gift. I got roasted, yes. But I also got clarity. I thought I had a solid group of friends, turns out I had a front row seat to my own roast hosted by people who think “mean but make it Pinterest” is a cute party idea.

So yeah. Next year, it’s just me, my cat, a pizza the size of a steering wheel, and zero surprises. And you know what? That honestly sounds perfect.

Thanks again for validating my gut feeling. Y’all really helped me feel seen.

Shapeshifting romances are all the rage today. I wrote this one in 2010. As I said in another post, I started it as a joke, but the characters grew on me. I wrote it like a dark fairy tale and dedicated to a friend of mine who I lost, who would have enjoyed this story. 

“But you still want to go caving with all of us?” Fee asked Faron.

   “I want to show you amateurs how it’s really done.”

   “Without killing us, I hope.” 

   “That’s the point. I hope to teach you how to be safe. It’s incredibly dangerous, and some of you seem incredibly stupid.”

Ignoring that, Fee wondered aloud, “How am I supposed to help plan it? It’s not like I know anything.” 

   “I’ll give you my phone number. Call me after school tomorrow. I get off work around the same time. We’ll talk about it, then.” 

   “Do you want my number?” 

   “What for?” 

   *I guess I meant nothing to him, after all.* 

   “In case you want to hang out.” 

   “Really?” 

   “I might need help with something else.” 

   “Like what?” 

   Fee bit her lip. 

   He touched her shoulder. “Come on. Tell me.” 

   “I’m afraid of the house I live in.” 

   Faron covered his face to hide his amusement, chuckling in  disbelief. “Why? Is it haunted?” 

   “Worse. It’s on a cliff.” 

   “Come on, show me,” he laughed even harder, eagerly rising to go see it. 

   “Don’t you have to work tomorrow?” 

   “I can spare a few more minutes.” 

   “It’s on Montesano.” 

   “That’s just a little hill.” 

   “Maybe to you.” 

   “Prove me wrong. I’ll follow you there.” 

   As they headed to their cars, Fee muttered, “No turning into a lizard man.” 

   “What?” 

   “Nothing,” she shrugged. 

In less than ten minutes, Faron joined her in the semicircle driveway in front of the wooden box house. He took his time surveying the structure arising from red clay. He walked around,  carefully appraising its location on the outcropping. A stone pathway wound through scattered pine trees to a large deck out back. He spied the sheer drop behind it. Lights lit up the valley below like stars in the Milky Way. 

   “It doesn’t look so bad,” he said, climbing the deck steps.

   “Look how far down the drop is!” 

Faron tried not to smile. The gently sloping yard ended ten feet away from the deck, before falling vertically twenty feet and then continuing into a more gradual decline. 

   “It’s a nice view,” he told her, taking it all in. “I would just sit out here for hours.” 

   Fee frowned. “I grew up in a very flat area. This takes time to get used to.” 

   “Why not start now?” 

   “What?” 

A devilish glint told her to be on her guard. 

“Come here.” 

“Why?” 

“Don’t you trust me?” Faron raised his hands like a wrestler, ready to take her down. Fee ran around the yellow deck chairs, trying not to laugh. After all, heights were no laughing matter to  her, but he was in a playful mood. 

“I just want to show you something.” 

“I don’t believe you. You want to dangle me over a cliff.” 

   “Maybe by a toe, but just for a moment. Until you agree to stop all of this nonsense about caves.” 

   “You better behave,” she warned. She shielded her body with a chair, but he was quick, chasing her out into the yard. “Don’t you dare!” 

   Faron scooped her up into his arms, grinning down at her,  and bounded toward the precipice. She wiggled in his arms, kicking her legs, trying to get free until the close proximity to the mountainside froze her. A few feet to their right, a loose rock broke free and bounced out of sight. 

   “Faron!” she yelled. “You better put me down, right now!” 

   “Not until you see how lovely this place is.” 

   “Well, I guess that’s never.” 

   “I can wait that long.” 

   “I’m serious.” 

   “Then agree that caving is not right for you, and we’ll end this right now.” 

   “But, I don’t want it to end…” 

   “Hello? Is everything okay out here?” 

   They both turned their heads toward the open sliding glass door, where the brown-haired woman in a gray skirt and white blouse greeted them, appearing as the stern mother and probably wondering if she should intervene. 

   Faron gingerly placed her down, while Fee quickly explained, “We’re just horsing around.” 

   “I didn’t know you had company, Fee,” Deidre said, her face softening. 

   “This is Faron.” 

   “Faron Rothschild,” he told her, shaking her hand.

Deidre gave an appraising glance of the clean cut boy and said, “Well, it’s nice to meet you.” 

   “You, too.” 

   “I was showing him the death-defying ridge.” 

   Actually, it was the other way around. 

   “You can always come inside,” Deidre suggested, opening the door wider, almost an order more than an invitation. But, at that moment, a gecko slithered up the glass, causing Deidre to jump back and shriek. She shooed at it with her manicured hands. 

   “It’s just a little lizard, Mom,” Fee told her, shaking her head. 

   “Hurry. Get it!” her Mom cried out. 

   The reptile darted away. 

   “It’s an innocent creature,” Fee remarked. “Leave it alone.”

   “Well, hurry up and get inside before we let a lizard in the  house.” 

Fee muttered, “I’m not sure Faron can come in. It’s late.”

   “I’m sure I can stay a little longer,” he offered, quietly laughing from the comment about the lizard. “Unless you have things to  do?”

 Fee lowered her head, whispering, “There’s not much to see.  I’m staying in my Mom’s old room.” 

   Of course, she didn’t want him to see that. 

   “I might want to see that,” he said low, so her Mom couldn’t hear. 

   Ignoring him, Fee stepped inside, as if entering a stranger’s house. She would have loved for him to see her beach home with  the bright, sunny rooms. This place was another story—like an  heirloom meant for the attic. Past the bright yellow kitchen, Fee led the way into the paneled family room. Embarrassing childhood photos lined the walls. Fee rested on the plaid couch with Faron choosing the opposite end. Only a dim lamp lit the small room. 

   “Did Fee eat anything?” Deidre asked Faron, who in turn scrutinized Fee. Fee slouched down into the couch. 

   He probably sensed this was an issue between them, but he told the truth. “No. I don’t think so.” 

   “Fee?” 

   “I meant to get something when I was out.” 

   “We’ll discuss this later.” 

   Fee stewed. This was not an argument she wanted to have in front of him. 

   “I’ll fix you both a snack,” her mother replied as she walked into the kitchen, off to the left of the family room.    She got busy rummaging through the refrigerator. 

   Fee turned on the TV, muttering, “My Mom thinks I have an eating disorder.” 

  “Do you?” 

  “I don’t think so.” 

   The conversation left her feeling uncomfortable. She didn’t want him wishing he could escape a troubled person’s house. She leaned forward, gripping her head in her hands. 

   “Do you have annoying parents, also?” she asked Faron.

   Fee bit her lip. She didn’t mean to say parents, since his mother had left. It slipped out. His eyes said he forgave her. 

   “I live with my grandfather. He can’t hear very well, so we don’t communicate much. My Dad is always gone…working.” 

  “You know, you seem more mature than any guy I know.”

  “Living in the country makes you grow up fast. Not street-wise like city kids, but self-reliant. I can grow and kill my own food, and I can fix just about anything.” 

   “I guess the suburbs didn’t teach me much, other than how to shop at the mall.” 

   Deidre walked in, carrying sandwiches over to the coffee  table. She gave Fee a warning stare, silently ordering her to eat before retreating from the room, again. Fee heard her footsteps going to the stairs, hopefully to turn in for the night. 

  Finally, they were alone, Fee thought. She was suddenly aware of his closeness. The clock ticked loudly on the wall behind them, as if telling her to hurry up and get it over with—to have a conversation with Faron about the kiss. She focused again on the TV,  channel surfing to pull herself together. She couldn’t help focusing on unexpected feelings. The air grew heavy. 

   “Faron?” 

   “Yes?” 

   She struggled to formulate the words. 

   “When you…when you kissed me,” she whispered, “was that part of my kung fu cave training, with me being the grasshopper or the cave cricket, and you being the wise teacher?” 

He was 18, only slightly older.

   Faron’s lips curled in a smirk. “I wanted to do that from the moment I saw you.” 

   “Why? Maybe the sunlight distorted your vision. What did you see?” 

   “I saw a vulnerable girl who moves with such gentleness that I was in awe. You would probably love the Earth if you weren’t so scared of it.” 

   “And that means a lot to you, that I love the Earth?” 

   “It means everything.” 

   She bit her lip, peeking as he slid over toward her. A few, mere inches separated them. She could feel his probing stare. 

   “What do you see when you see me?” 

   Their eyes tentatively met. She would have poured her soul out had he asked. 

   “I see goodness, like a guardian angel protecting me.” 

He soaked in her words, shaking his head in disagreement.

   “I’m a loner, Fee. I’m not the best kind of boyfriend.”

   He picked up her hand and brought it to his lips, negating his own words.  

  “You probably shouldn’t think of me like that,” he added.

  “Then you probably shouldn’t have kissed me or be touching  me, now.” 

   He nodded in agreement. 

   “But I’m glad you did.” 

   To keep the mood from deepening, Faron lifted the plate of sandwiches and placed it between them, saying, “You better eat something.” 

   Fee reluctantly picked at the ham to prove she didn’t have a problem, while offering Faron one of the sandwiches. 

  Seeming  hungry, Faron ate half, focusing his attention on her, as always, while he ate. 

   “What are you thinking?” she asked, admiring his flawless skin, as if its perfection was an indicator of its illusion. 

   “This sandwich is pretty good.” 

   Fee snickered. “No, what were you really thinking?” 

   “It’s getting late. I have work, and you have school.” 

   “I guess I’ll see you tomorrow.” 

   “What if I say I changed my mind and that you should find a new hobby and stay out of caves?” 

   Her green eyes challenged him. Was he serious? 

   “Then I will go into the tunnels.” 

   “That’s blackmail.” 

   “I don’t play fair, and neither do you.” 

   Shaking his head, he whispered, “No one could save you in there.” 

   “Not even you?” 

   “What do you think you know, Fee? I can feel it when you look at me. What are you trying to see…or trying not to see?”

*I’m waiting for your pupils to elongate, dummy!* 

   “I don’t think you need to hide from me. I want you to trust me.” 

   “Come on,” he sighed, getting to his feet. “It’s late.” 

   At that proximity, she could see he was almost a foot taller  than she was. 

“Are you sure I can’t hide you in my room? I don’t want to be alone.” 

   Faron whispered, “I’m sure your mother is pacing in her room right now, wondering when to shoo me out of here.”

   *Like that lizard?* 

   Fee laughed and slowly followed, though not wanting him to leave. Breezy mountain air hit them—a bit cool even in May at  that elevation—as they stepped into the star-covered night. Fee loved the patterns of stars against the blackness—little pinpoints of light guiding the way. She found the night peaceful when she was not alone. 

   “I think it’s a full moon,” Fee said, pointing to the huge rock above them and happy she’d never have to climb it in her lifetime. 

   “I don’t turn into a werewolf, if that’s what you’re afraid of.” 

   “I wasn’t afraid,” she retorted, “but *do* you turn into anything?”

   Faron grunted in annoyance. “There’s only one way to seal your lips.” 

   He gently cupped her head with his hands and bent closer, gliding his lips over hers and sending electric waves through her. He briefly captured her lower lip between his before coaxing a  deeper kiss. Her mind went blank, erasing her question…for a moment. 

   She needed a second to slow her heartbeat and restart her  brain. 

  “Um, you didn’t answer my question.” 

  “Wasn’t that better than an answer?” 

   Fee lowered her head, grinning. She couldn’t argue with that. 

   “I’ll see you tomorrow, Fee.” 

   “But I need to tell you something.” 

   Faron opened his car door, cautiously asking, “What?”

*About a man who guards caves who morphed into a creature when I  was five years old…like you did in the car.* 

   “Nothing. It can wait.” ",1,1753468701.0,MelissaRovellibooks,0,1.0,False

I had an odd encounter today with a very aggressive man. I had a laptop on the table in black sheep coffee. A man had plugged his laptop charger into the plug not near him but across near where I sat.

He asked to get his plug and I moved my laptop. As I moved it he kept saying ""is that ok with you?"". I moved my laptop and didnt say anything. Then he starts saying I'm ignoring him cause he's white. I had moved my laptop then I said I'd moved my laptop. He then launched into a tirade making out I had a bad attitude and also added a homophobic insult.

I was already in a phone call and had moved on. He then came to tap me and told me to read some Israel gaza leaflet. He wasn't even Geordie but it was an odd encounter. 

I'm so confused as to what happened as I moved my laptop for him to get the plig. I'm not sure but the placement of the charger makes me feel he was trying to pick a fight.

We’ve got a communal Keurig. Nothing fancy, just your standard setup with a drawer full of random K-Cups everyone contributes to. It’s a very “unspoken honor system” kind of thing.

And then came Danielle.

Danielle transferred from another office last year and immediately gave “corporate girlboss with menace energy.” Think loud phone calls, passive-aggressive compliments, and always wearing heels that echo down the hall like judgment.

At first, we all tried to be welcoming. But within a week, she was drinking six cups of coffee a day from the Keurig. Six. We know because she kept announcing it:

“Just finished cup #5! Gotta stay sharp, ladies!”

Cool, Danielle. Except she never brought her own pods.

Like… ever.

The office manager (a literal saint) sent a kind reminder asking folks to contribute to the K-Cup drawer. Danielle responded by labeling the whole drawer with her name. Like, a literal Post-it that said “Danielle’s Fuel Station.”

It was... a choice.

Then she started leaving empty K-Cup boxes next to the drawer, as if we’d believe she restocked. Sis, the box says “Pumpkin Spice,” and no one has seen a single pumpkin spice pod in this building since 2021.

But the final straw?

She tried to make instant oatmeal directly in the Keurig. Like, no mug. Just the oatmeal packet under the spout. The machine literally exploded. There were oats in the drip tray, in the water tank, on the ceiling tile. It smelled like burnt maple syrup for days.

That’s when the office manager snapped and taped a note to the Keurig:

“Danielle is no longer permitted to use this machine. Please do not let her ‘borrow’ your mug. We are not responsible for oat-related incidents.”

Danielle now brings a sad jar of instant coffee and glares at the machine like it personally betrayed her. I just make my coffee with headphones in and try not to laugh when someone whispers “Keurig Killer” under their breath.",1190,1753468571.0,coworkerstories,172,0.94,False

I had a baby several months back. I eat high fat, tallow butter ghee; mostly beef, some lamb, salmon, & rarely pork; whole milk plain Greek yogurt, 4% milkfat cottage cheese, soy-free organic eggs; Himalayan salt; spring water & carbonated mineral water. Occasionally I’ll have cured meats or coffee. 

I have a script for synthroid. I never saw improvement in my bloodwork and stopped taking it. I do take iodine & vitamin d drops. I have been feeling low energy and suspected my thyroid, today I noticed a small goiter has developed. 

I prefer to treat & manage naturally but yes, I will be seeing my pcp for a refill on my synthroid. I’m looking for diet based recommendations to support healing thank you!

Instead, he was just real—awkwardly hilarious and genuniely trying—which made me realize how much we put people on pedestals before we even know them. We endd up spending two hours definitely NOT discussing his killer workouts but laughing over our mutual inabilitty to walk anywhere wuthout tripping.

# Transcript

0:00My brothers and sisters, the night that changed my life began like many others with the soft glow of my latest

0:06generation LG smart TV illuminating the darkness of my living room. I had  
0:12finished my devotions. My Bible lay open on the coffee table, and I felt the need  
0:17for a little rest after a long day of interaction. Netflix, that ubiquitous

0:22platform that promised a universe of entertainment just a click away, has become my silent escape, a harmless

0:29luxury that I believed didn't interfere with my walk with Christ. However, in  
0:36the stillness of that night, something broke, an almost imperceptible fisher in

0:41reality that would soon open to reveal a spiritual abyss I had never imagined. The screen, instead of displaying the0:48usual menu, flickered with a fleeting image, an ancient eye etched in stone that for a moment seemed to observe me  
0:55with cold ancient intelligence before being replaced by the familiar red Netflix logo. A chill ran down my spine,  
1:03but I attributed it to fatigue, to the suggestion of my mind. Ah, the subtlety  
1:09of deception. The air in the room began to feel thick, heavy, as if an invisible  
1:14blanket had settled over me, suffocating the lightness I'd previously felt from the Holy Spirit. As I scrolled through

1:21the recommendations, I noticed something disturbing. Titles I hadn't previously  
1:27remembered, documentaries about esoteric cults, series that explored the occult with an almost academic curiosity began  
1:34to appear prominently. My fingers, almost by inertia, gravitated toward one  
1:40of them, a series about ancient civilizations and their pagan deities. I  
1:45didn't choose it out of interest, but rather out of a strange compulsion, a magnetic attraction that drew me toward  
1:52the unknown. The images on the screen, although aesthetically well produced,  
1:58instilled a subtle discord in my spirit, a cognitive dissonance that jarred with every fiber of my faith, yet somehow

2:05kept me glued. Absorbed by the constant flow of information, the shadows in the  
2:10corners of my living room seemed to take on a life of their own, dancing to the rhythm of the tribal drums that echoed  
2:17from the speakers. As the series progressed, the discomfort grew. It  
2:22wasn't fear, but a deep sadness, an anguish I couldn't explain. The voices  
2:27of the aerodite and convincing presenters dispelled with cold logic the truth revealed in scripture sowing doubt  
2:34about the miracles of Jesus, trivializing the resurrection, and presenting the Bible as a collection of2:40myths and fables. Every argument, every archaeological discovery was a poisoned  
2:46arrow aimed straight at the heart of my faith. My eyes once fixed on the shepherd of shepherds were now glued to  
2:53a screen that wo web of intellectual deception. I remembered the words of Revelation 12:9 that he deceives the  
3:00whole world. And I felt an icy chill because I realized that without realizing it, I a servant of God was I3:08was being seduced by that same narrative. The subtle poison seeped into my mind, eroding the foundations of my  
3:15belief. Then something inexplicable happened. As the screen displayed an  
3:20ancient pagan ritual, the atmosphere in my living room turned frigid. A chilling  
3:26wind blew through the air, stirring the curtains, even though all the windows were closed. My Bible, lying on the  
3:33coffee table, mysteriously slid to the floor, falling open on the book of John.

3:39It was then that I saw the first manifestation of the supernatural. The screen that had previously shown the  
3:45ritual footage distorted violently as if attacked by energetic interference. The  
3:51image dissolved into erratic pixels, and for a moment I could see a shadowy, barely perceptible figure moving rapidly  
3:58within the television frame as if trying to escape its digital prison. Dot. An inhuman guttural whale filled the room.  
4:06A sound that vibrated in my bones and chilled my blood. but it wasn't coming from the movie, but from the TV itself.  
4:13I tried to turn off the television, press the power button on the remote, but it didn't respond. The lights in my  
4:20house began to flicker frantically in sync with my erasing heartbeat. The figure on the screen grew more defined,

4:27darker, and its contours seemed to distort, elongate, as if the laws of  
4:32physics were being violated before my eyes. It was as if the veil between the spiritual and earthly worlds had been  
4:39torn, and a nefarious entity was trying to manifest itself through that digital portal. The smell of sulfur, faint at  
4:48first, grew more intense, burning my sinuses, an unmistakable sign of a  
4:53demonic presence. The television, with a metallic creek, began to lean forward as  
4:58if an invisible force were pushing it, threatening to fall off its stand. My mind, though terrified, continued to  
5:06cling to the truth. He is real. Dot. In the midst of that supernatural chaos, a  
5:11deep resonant voice, not from the TV speakers, but directly in my spirit,  
5:17spoke to me. It was not a voice audible to my fleshly ears, but a direct communication with my innermost being,

5:24with my soul. Elijah, the voice said, You have allowed the enemy to enter  
5:29through a door of subtle deception. Do you not know that he disguises himself as an angel of light and his servants as

5:36ministers of justice? Be watchful. Awake. The truth is in my word, not in  
5:42the imitations of the world. It was the voice of God, a voice of unwavering  
5:47love, but also of divine rebuke. The television hearing that voice seemed to  
5:53tremble as if the entity within it was suffering indescribable agony. Dot. It was a moment of pure glory manifested

6:00without preaching, without human intervention, only the sovereign voice of the creator. The power of that voice  
6:07was instantaneous like a miracle of deliverance without human intervention.  
6:13The television snapped upright and the image of the shadowy figure vanished completely. Instead, the screen lit up  
6:20with a pure blinding light that emanated a sense of immeasurable peace and holiness. The smell of sulfur  
6:27disappeared, replaced by a sweet fragrance like the delirium of the valley. I felt an indescribable warmth

6:34in my chest, and the invisible chains that had held me captive before the screen vanished. A deep shame filled me

6:40for my spiritual neglect, but it was immediately supplanted by overwhelming gratitude. The glory of the Lord filled

6:48my living room, tangible and real, without the need for a sermon, without the laying on of hands, just his

6:54presence. The scriptures of Deuteronomy  
 4:24 echoed in my mind. For the Lord  
7:01your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God. My vision sharpened. Now on the

7:07television screen instead of any Netflix show, I could see for a moment as if  
7:12through a translucent window the face of Christ filled with compassion and infinite love. Dot his eyes shone like

7:19flames of fire, and from his mouth came a sharp two-edged sword, as described in

7:25Revelation 11:16. It wasn't a static image. His lips moved, and although I

7:31didn't hear any audible words, I understood his message. Do not return to me, Elijah. Time is running short. Do

7:39not seek the truth where the enemy sws lies. I am the way, the truth, and the life. The television screen, which had

7:47once been a portal of deception, had now been transformed into an altar of revelation, a mirror of God's glory.  
7:53Dot. Tears sprang to my eyes, not from fear, but from deep repentance and a  
7:58restored love for the one who had rescued me from the pit. Dot. The experience transformed me. The spiritual

8:05shadows that had clung to my life, imperceptible to me before, began to dissipate. My appetite for the things of

8:12the world diminished drastically, and my thirst for the word of God became insatiable. I found a new urgency in my  
8:20spirit to pray, to intercede, to seek the lost. My preaching took on a new  
8:25fire, a prophetic authority I hadn't possessed before. My spiritual eyes were  
8:31open to see the ws of the enemy. Not only on Netflix, but in every facet of  
8:36popular culture, in music, in video games, in the ideologies that subtly  
8:41infiltrated to distort God's truth. I understood that the battle was not against flesh and blood, but against  
8:48powers and principalities that use the tools of this world to deceive even the elect. Testimonies began to emerge in my  
8:56congregation. members who were struggling with subtle entertainment addictions or unexplained spiritual  
9:02apathy began to experience supernatural deliverances. A young man, formerly  
9:07enslaved by online pornography, testified that while I was preaching about the power of God's word, he felt  
9:14as if invisible chains were breaking from his spirit and his cell phone screen shattered in his imagination. An  
9:21indescribable peace came over him. A sister who suffered from chronic insomnia, attributed to anxiety from

9:28binge watching horror series, claimed that one night while she was praying, a bright light filled her room and a

9:34gentle voice said, ""Sleep in peace, child. My spirit is watching over you.""  
9:40From then on, she slept soundly, free from nightmares. I began preaching with  
9:46an intensity she had never known before, exposing the strategies of the digital age. I spoke about how entertainment in  
9:53its purest form is not evil. But how can it be co-opted and perverted to sew

9:59seeds of iniquity, doubt, and confusion in the hearts of believers? It  
10:04illustrated how anti-Christian narratives infiltrated under the guise of freedom of expression or diversity,  
10:10and how without discernment, we could be drawn into a deception that subtly led us away from the truth of Christ.

10:17Churches began to experience a revival, a new hunger for purity and holiness,  
10:22and an awakening to spiritual warfare in the digital realm. People came to me

10:27after services with tears in their eyes, confessing how they had allowed these harmless influences to contaminate their  
10:34spirits. People brought their televisions and devices and either consecrated them to the Lord or  
10:40discarded them completely in an act of radical renunciation. I remember one particular afternoon during a  
10:47deliverance service when a woman approached with a haunted look on her face. She had a Netflix app on her phone

10:54and even though it wasn't open, it felt like a bondage. As we prayed for her,10:59the phone in her hands began to vibrate uncontrollably and the screen flickered11:04with chaotic images before the device completely shut down with a small click. A miracle of deliverance without the11:11laying on of hands. Only by the power of the spirit manifesting, the woman fell11:16to her knees, weeping with relief, testifying that she felt a heavy burden lifted from her shoulders at that very11:22moment. Dot. My testimony spread, resonating in the hearts of many. I11:27received invitations to preach in other cities and countries, carrying the warning and the message of deliverance.11:35The manifestations of God's glory were evident in every meeting. The atmosphere11:40was filled with his presence and people were healed, delivered, and filled with the Holy Spirit without anyone saying a11:47word to them. It was a glory so manifest that it didn't need preaching to be felt. It was palpable, visible to11:54spiritual eyes. People lay prostrate on the ground with tears of joy and repentance, while the Holy Spirit12:01transformed them from the inside out, restoring their lives from the subtle influences they had absorbed from the12:07world. The anointing was so heavy that at times I couldn't even speak only to12:12feel the presence of God moving. But the enemy didn't rest. Social media, which12:18had previously been a means of sharing the word, began to fill with attacks, slander, and mockery of my message. They12:25called me a fanatic, ignorant, and paranoid. They accused me of wanting to12:30control people, of imposing my own rules. However, in the midst of12:35persecution, I felt God's voice in my spirit once again, clear and comforting.12:41Fear not, Elijah. He who is of God hears the word of God. The world hated me12:47first. Persevere, for great is your reward in heaven. Those words gave me12:52the strength to keep going, knowing that the truth, no matter how unpopular, would always prevail in the end. I12:59understood that the spiritual battle was not just a matter of exorcisms and great demons, but was fought in subtleties, in13:07the small concessions we make to the world, in the entertainment we consume, in the ideas we allow to enter our minds13:14without discernment. He doesn't always manifest himself with horns and a tail.13:19Sometimes he comes in the form of an addictive series, a compelling documentary, or an inspiring film that13:25subtly diverts our attention from the absolute truth of Christ. His strategy13:31is subversion, gradual infiltration, and the normalization of what is abominable13:36in God's eyes. It is the steady trickle of small lies that over time erode the13:42foundations of our faith. The most profound revelation I received was that the key to victory lies not in external13:49censorship but in internal discernment. It's not about banning platforms but13:54about cleansing our own spirits. The voice of God had told me, ""If my children who are called by my name will14:02humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will come from heaven and forgive14:08their sins and heal their land."" The spiritual healing of a nation begins with the spiritual healing of each14:14individual. And that healing comes from a surrendered, vigilant, and spirit-filled heart. Netflix was just a14:22tool. The real problem was a lack of discernment and the comfort that had allowed my faith to fall asleep. My14:29ministry changed forever. I no longer preached just about sin and salvation, but about spiritual warfare in the14:36digital age, about the importance of holiness in a world saturated with corrupting influences. I instructed14:43believers to examine themselves, to evaluate every piece of content they consumed in light of God's word, to pray14:50for discernment, and to seek the guidance of the Holy Spirit. everything. He taught them to be like the Brians who14:57searched the scriptures daily to see if the things they were being told were true. The church grew stronger, and the15:03testimony of how he used Netflix to deceive Christians became a rallying cry, a call to spiritual awakening in a15:11world hurtling toward darkness, blind to subtle deception. That night, my15:16television, that portal of deception, remained off and broken for weeks, a monument to my deliverance. I didn't15:24repair it, I left it there as a constant reminder of the fine line between harmless entertainment and an open door15:30to the enemy. Every time I looked at it, I remembered the voice of God that had rent the veil, the glory that had filled15:38my living room, and the miraculous deliverance I had experienced without human intervention. It became a silent15:45altar, a mute testimony to God's power to rescue from even the most subtle traps. My eyes now saw beyond the15:52screen. They saw the heart of the deception. Today, my life is a living testimony to that night. My home is a16:00sanctuary, and every electronic device is purified with prayer. It's not about16:05living in a bubble, but about living with discernment, about being a light in the midst of darkness. Experience taught16:12me that the enemy doesn't need satanic temples or dark rituals to operate.16:17Sometimes all he needs is a remote control and a subscription to a streaming platform. His tactic is16:24access, familiarity, and normalization. He sits on our couches and in our beds16:30and whispers lies to us through the comfort of our screens, corrupting our faith little by little. He uses what is16:37within easy reach, what seems harmless, what doesn't raise suspicions. He16:42doesn't want you to rebel, but to conform. He doesn't want you to hate him, but to tolerate him. He doesn't16:49want you to realize you're being deceived until it's too late. My warning is clear. Worldly entertainment is a16:56spiritual battlefield. Discern every program, every movie, every song you17:01allow into your home. Ask yourself, does this build my spirit? Does it bring me17:07closer to God or further away from him? Does it glorify Christ or darkness? The17:13battle is real, my brothers and sisters, and it is fought in every pixel, in every bite of information our mind17:20consumes. The word of God is our sword, prayer, our shield, and discernment our17:26beacon in the midst of this digital darkness. Do not be naive. Do not be17:31complacent. The enemy is active, and his schemes are more sophisticated than ever. He disguises himself, camouflages17:39himself, and presents himself as innocent. But the Holy Spirit who dwells in us gives us the ability to discern.17:46He will reveal the traps, show us the way, and give us the strength to resist.17:52Do not underestimate small concessions, for they are the ones that open the largest doors to the influence of the17:58evil one. And to those who doubt my testimony, to those who think I am exaggerating or crazy, I say, he who has18:06ears to hear, let him hear. I don't expect everyone to understand this18:11because the wisdom of God is foolishness to the world. But I know what I experienced. I know what I saw and I18:18know the voice I heard. That night, the Lord opened my eyes to a spiritual18:23reality that many Christians ignore. He showed me how a seemingly harmless tool18:28had become a Trojan horse, introducing demonic influences directly into the homes of believers, dulling their18:35spirits and blinding their eyes to the truth. This revelation is for all of you. This is not a fictional story. It18:44is a testimony to the spiritual war being waged in our days. The battle for souls is being fought not only in the18:50pull pits but also on our television screens, on social media, in every corner of the culture we consume. He is18:58cunning, but our God is infinitely more powerful. He has given us all the tools19:03necessary to resist the enemy and remain firm in the faith. May this testimony19:08serve as a warning and a wakeup call. May the Holy Spirit enlighten you to discern darkness from light and always19:15seek the truth in the only unwavering source, the Holy Word of God. My prayer19:21is that each of you will experience the same revelation and deliverance that I experienced. May the Lord Jesus Christ19:28open your eyes to the hidden traps of the enemy, and may his glory be manifested in your lives in such a way19:34as to dispel all darkness. Let us not allow the world's entertainment to rob19:39us of communion with our creator. Let us be vigilant. Let us be holy. And let us19:45be the light that shines in the midst of darkness. Amen. The battle is not over,19:51but victory is assured in Christ Jesus. The fight, however, intensified on other19:58fronts. It was not only the attack of unbelievers or the confused. The true20:03test came when I saw fellow believers, even leaders who, blinded by comfort and20:09fear of fanaticism, refused to accept the seriousness of my warning. Some20:14pastors whom I deeply respected, confronted me, arguing that my message20:20was divisive, that I was fear-mongering, and that it delegitimized the progress of the church in the modern age. I felt20:27disillusionment in my spirit, a bitter pang, as I saw how the same spirit of deception, now under the banner of20:34tolerance or cultural relevance, had infiltrated the pulpits, silencing the20:39prophetic voice. Their eyes, once filled with fervor for the gospel, now20:44displayed a kind of apathy, a comfort that was more dangerous than any frontal attack. It was as if an invisible veil20:52covered their spiritual eyes, preventing them from seeing the magnitude of the deception. But the voice of God resumed20:59it in my spirit again. Gentle but firm, like the rushing of many waters described in Revelation 1:15. Elijah, do21:08not fret over those who will not hear. My word will not return to me empty.21:13Your calling is to preach the truth in season and out of season. I have anointed you to open the eyes of the21:20spiritually blind. The harvest is great, but the laborers are few. Keep sowing,21:26for I will give the growth."" Those words gave me renewed strength. It wasn't21:31about being popular or accepted by everyone, but about being faithful to the revelation I had received. The21:38prophet's loneliness was a heavy burden, but divine support made it bearable. I21:43felt the power of Isaiah 57. Therefore, I was not ashamed. That's why I set my21:50face like flint, and I know I will not be put to shame. It was then that miracles began to manifest in an even21:57more surprising way, confirming the validity of my message at an evangelistic crusade in a coastal city.22:04While I was breaching about the need to break free from the bonds of idolatrous entertainment, a man in the crowd, his22:11skin covered in tattoos and his eyes bloodshot, she began to convulse violently. There was no laying on of22:18hands. There were no screams from outside, only the power of the word being preached. From her mouth came a22:25thick, dark liquid, and a guttural whale filled the auditorium. In a second, she22:31collapsed. inert. We thought the worst, but then with a leap, she stood up, her22:38eyes clear, her features serene, and she testified in a firm voice that she had felt an instant liberation from years of22:45addiction to dark internet content and violent video games. Her skin somehow22:51seemed less tattooed, as if the marks had lost their pigmentation. Another miracle occurred with a young woman who22:57had fallen into a deep depression, fueled by social media and TV shows that23:02idealized sadness and emptiness. While I was praying for the congregation, without touching her, she felt an23:10electric shock run through her body. She raised her hands to heaven and suddenly a brilliant blue light emanated from her23:17eyes. It lasted only an instant and then vanished. The next day, her face had23:23previously radiated a joy that could not be faked. She recounted that in that moment of prayer, a gentle but powerful23:30voice had told her, ""Daughter, I am your joy, and in my presence there is fullness of joy."" It was a liberation23:37without human intervention, a direct touch of the Holy Spirit that restored soul and spirit, freeing her from the23:44invisible chains of despair that the digital world had forged. The glory manifested without breaching became a23:51constant in our meetings during times of worship when the Holy Spirit moved23:56freely. The atmosphere became so dense that some fell to the ground not from emotion but from the weight of the24:03divine presence. We saw anti-ynical or skeptical people burst into tears24:08confessing hidden sins renouncing evil influences they had allowed into their lives through television or the24:15internet. I could feel the holiness in the air, a consuming fire that purified24:20hearts and revealed what was hidden in darkness. Faces were transformed. Pala24:26gave way to radiance and dull eyes shone with a new light. It was the manifestation of the shikina. The24:33tangible presence of God that needed no words but revealed itself. Even inanimate objects seemed to react to the24:40anointing. On one occasion, while praying for a home where the family had been experiencing constant nightmares24:47after binge watching a horror series on Netflix, a television that was off in the living room suddenly made a24:53high-pitched screech and shut off completely, leaving a burning smell. It hadn't been connected to power, yet the25:00power of prayer had broken through the spiritual veil that had been established through that device. The once skeptical25:07family knelt, crying out for mercy, understanding that the spiritual battle was real and that the enemy was using25:14any means to infiltrate. It was a dramatic demonstration of God's power over the adversaries schemes. God's25:21voice became my constant companion, a compass in the midst of the confusion.25:26It was no longer just a voice in my spirit, but manifested through the scriptures in a new and living way. Each25:33verse seemed to come alive, revealing deeper layers of meaning, warning me of hidden dangers, and showing me the way25:40forward. I felt the presence of Jesus walking beside me, whispering eternal25:45truths to my heart. Isaiah 30 hours 21 minutes became a reality in my life.25:52Then your ears will hear a word behind you, saying, ""This is the way. Walk in25:58it, and do not turn to the right hand or to the left."" The direction was clear,26:03the purpose undeniable. People in my congregation began to share their own26:08experiences of discernment. One mother testified how her teenage son, obsessed26:14with a violent video game, suddenly began drawing strange symbols and having night terrors. She, following my advice,26:22prayed for discernment, and upon examining the game, discovered it contained occult elements and subliminal26:28references to demons. In an act of faith, she destroyed the game. And that26:34same night, her son slept peacefully for the first time in months, waking up with a new sweetness in his eyes. It was a26:41poignant reminder of how the enemy attacks the most vulnerable, using what seems innocent to sow discord in the26:48soul. Discernment became a vital tool. I taught my sheep not to be meat for the26:53butcher in the digital realm, not to indiscriminately consume what the world offered them. I urged them to ask27:00themselves, ""Is this edifying me? Is this bringing me closer to holiness? Is27:06this honoring Christ?"" The answers to those questions became the filter for everything they allowed into their homes27:12and their minds. We understood that true freedom is not the ability to do whatever we want, but the ability to do27:19what is right, what pleases God, freed from the slavery of darkness. This was27:25the visible transformation many experienced, leaving behind life patterns they had previously considered27:31normal. The prophetic anointing that had been given to me was not only to warn, but also to activate. I saw members of27:39my congregation, once timid and apathetic, rise up with a new passion for evangelization.27:45They began to witness in their workplaces, in their schools, in their communities about the need to awaken27:52spiritually and break free from the bonds of the world. The church became a beacon of light in the midst of27:58darkness, an army of discerning believers armed with the truth and empowered by the Holy Spirit to thwart28:05the works of the enemy, even in the most subtle and everyday spheres. It was the28:10fulfillment of Joel 2:28. and afterward I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh28:16and your sons and your daughters will prophesy. Your old men will dream dreams28:22and your young men will see visions. The profound revelation that dawned on me in28:27those days was the true nature of the endtime deception. It would not be an antichrist who would sit on a visible  
28:34throne and blaspheme openly, but a subtle infiltration, a massive programming of minds through the media,

28:40shaping the perception of truth and morality, preparing the ground for the acceptance of a global system that would  
28:46defy God. Netflix and other similar platforms were just the tip of the iceberg. Massive tools for the cultural  
28:54and spiritual re-education of the masses, eroding biblical values and replacing them with a secular humanist  
29:01worldview that was at its core antichrist. I understood that he doesn't  
29:06fear a cross on a wall, but rather a heart surrendered to the truth. He doesn't fear an eloquent sermon, but

29:13rather a life transformed by the power of the Holy Spirit. His strategy is  
29:18subtlety, dilution, and the normalization of iniquity until it becomes imperceptible to slumbering  
29:24eyes. He wanted Christians to feel comfortable with the light he offered. A false light that was actually darkness  
29:31in disguise. I saw that the battle for the soul would not be fought with tanks and bombs, but with narratives, with

29:38images, with algorithms that would whispered directly into our minds under the guise of entertainment. The real

29:46danger wasn't what Netflix explicitly showed, but what it subliminally instilled. A spirit of moral relativism,  
29:53of skepticism toward the supernatural, of idolatry, of ego and pleasure. Series  
29:59that glorified immorality were presented as art. Those that mocked faith as  
30:04comedy, and documentaries that attacked biblical truth as knowledge. It was the same ancient serpent, the same Edenic

30:12strategy with which God has spoken to you. The subtlety of deception was its most potent weapon, and spiritual

30:19ignorance its ally. My heart broke as I saw so many brothers and sisters fall

30:24into that trap. I remember a vision I had during a vigil. I saw a vast ocean,

30:30and in it countless ships bearing the Christian flag, floating peacefully, but from the depths rose dark, almost

30:36invisible tentacles that attached themselves to the ship's holes, and without anyone noticing, slowly dragged

30:44them toward a gigantic whirlpool in the center of the ocean. In the center of the whirlpool, I could see the giant

30:50Netflix logo flashing, mesmerizing the sailors. It was a striking vision that  
30:56seared my call into my memory. My mission became clearer than ever to be a  
31:01warning beacon in the midst of the storm. To speak out against the deceptive currents that dragged

31:07believers away from the shore of truth. It wasn't about being popular, but about  
31:12being faithful. It wasn't about pleasing men, but about pleasing God. The cost  
31:18was high. The persecution inevitable, but the reward was eternal. I felt the

31:23weight of responsibility but also God's anointing to carry out this task. The

31:29visible transformation in my life was not only spiritual but physical. My eyes  
31:34burned with a holy passion. My voice acquired an unwavering authority. People

31:40after hearing my testimony often asked me, ""Pastor Elias, what can we do then?

31:46Should we live isolated from the world?"" And my answer was always the same. No my

31:52beloved we must be in the world but not of the world. We must be light not  
31:58absorbing darkness. The key is not isolation but discernment constant  
32:04prayer study diligent dapalabra genuine communion with other believers and

32:09obedience to the Holy Spirit are our weapons in this invisible war. This wasn't a crusade against a platform but  
32:16a call to radical holiness in the digital age. I felt the fire of the Holy Spirit burning within me, a senseless  
32:24flame that drove me to preach with more urgency, with more passion. The churches  
32:29that welcomed me to share my testimony experienced a genuine revival. People

32:34publicly confessed their addiction to worldly entertainment, their blindness to subtle deception, and experienced a  
32:41liberation that manifested itself in tears of repentance and shouts of joy. It was a glory manifested without  
32:48preaching because the very atmosphere was charged with the presence of God, breaking invisible chains and opening  
32:55the eyes of the spiritually blind. The conviction was palpable and the power of  
33:00God was undeniable. The last profound revelation the Lord gave me was about  
33:05time. He showed me that these digital deceptions are a clear sign that we are in the last days, that the coming of  
33:12Christ is closer than we imagine. The speed with which lies spread through these platforms is astonishing, paving  
33:18the way for the spirit of the Antichrist, who will seek to deceive even the chosen. It is a warning sign, a

33:26call to constant vigilance, to watch and pray so as not to fall into temptation.  
33:31He knows his time is short, and that is why he is attacking with all his ws,  
33:36using every tool at his disposal to divert and destroy. My call is stronger  
33:41than ever. I cannot hide what I saw, what I heard, what I experienced. This

33:47is my testimony, a prophetic warning for the church in the end times. He is real,  
33:53and his strategy is subtle deception, often disguised as harmless entertainment. But Christ is more real,  
34:01and his power is infinitely greater. He has given us victory, but we must be

34:06vigilant, discerning, and in constant communion with him. May this testimony,  
34:11my brothers and sisters, awaken your spirits and give you the strength to resist every while of the enemy and to  
34:18live lives that glorify him who rescued us from darkness into his marvelous light. Thus, my life has become an echo

Here are some helpful ADHD tips I learned from my psychiatrist today! This is not medical advice, just something I thought people could take nuggets away from. Feel free to adjust or correct me if I’m wrong!

1. If you take stimulants to manage your ADHD, be sure to take it 30 minutes after waking up if you don’t have coffee, and about 90 minutes after waking up if you do have coffee within that time period. This is because when you first begin waking up, cortisol spikes which gives you a bit of an energy boost. So wait to take anything that boosts your energy for a bit to maximize your energy. (I know he’s controversial, but Andrew Huberman has a podcast on this.)
2. Taking breaks between uninterrupted power sprints of work/productivity is helpful in managing productivity. Rather than allowing yourself to chase every distraction, you train your brain to know when it’s distraction time. 
3. Create routines! This helps put your brain in a state where you don’t have to think too hard about decisions. This could even be something small like having pre-set outfits for each day of the week. 
4. Allow your brain to “dump” itself. When you are doing a task and want to minimize distracting thoughts, jot down any thoughts that pop up and revisit them later. You’re allowing your brain a bit of room to wander while also remaining on task. 
5. “Warm” your brain up to a task. Going cold turkey does not work well for most ADHD brains, apparently, so allowing yourself to ease into a task is better than jumping in and abandoning it quickly. My psychiatrist explained this as driving slowly over a speed bump rather than flooring it. 
6. Recognize that distractions are bids for dopamine boosts. For example, stopping what you’re doing to complete a menial, non-essential task is your brain’s way of getting a quick dopamine boost rather than waiting to get the boost from completing the longer task at hand. Our brain wants something quick, but resist if possible—you’ll get the boost eventually!

I hope these tips are as helpful to you guys as they are to me. I plan to build more structure in my daily routines and “warm” my brain up before attempting daunting tasks.

1m96u7o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1m96u7o/hyperactive_spouse/,Hyperactive spouse,"I (25F) looking for advice on dealing with my hyperactive spouse (30M) 
At first, I loved the relationship because he seemed a little calmer, and was always planning activities and I loved that in a man. I was never bored with him. Fast forward 6 years now I have a hyperactive spouse and child and it is driving me INSANE. For context, I am not the calmest person ever, but I grew up with a very laid back family. My whole life I was used to waking up, drinking coffee by a fire outside talking to my mom & dad relaxed for an hour, then going on with our day. Now, my Saturday and Sunday mornings are a nightmare. The things I used to love the most, are now what I hate the most. My toddler and my husband wake up, it’s chaos. They’re loud, my husband teases my toddler as a joke and my toddler is all about snitching now so he’ll come up to me whining “mommy daddy did this” or he’ll cry to get my attention. They talk extremely loudly sometimes yelling until I can hear ringing in my ears & at that point I have to step out because I get angry. My husband rushes around the entire house tidying it up. 
Etc. Yesterday we were at my moms pool and my husband was throwing my toddler in the water which I had to yell at him to stop because he was going too close to the edge & I didn’t want my toddler to accidentally hit his head, my toddler was jumping in places he wasn’t supposed to , running around the pool, splashing adults, I had to put him in time out. I asked my moms friend who works with troubled kids if she thought he maybe had ADD (I have it, minus the hyper active part) and she said he’s a little too young to tell but he definitely has hyperactivity. 

Another example could be that when we go on vacation, there is no relaxing with my spouse. Which bothers me. For me I want to take nice walks, go on the beach and chill. We can do excursions I don’t mind, (I am really not a boring person) but on vacation I rarely even see my spouse because he is playing volleyball pickleball all the activities on a resort. Last time he had done all the activities all day long and was bored by day 3. (There was yoga tennis pickleball volleyball surfing boating) and I was just enjoying and savouring every single moment with my toddler, boating together in the mornings then relaxing playing in the sand. I felt like he honestly ruined my trip. For more context, he also freaks out when there is a minor change of plans, eg I miss an exit on the road and he freaks out, meanwhile if he does it I’ll just be like don’t worry babe we’ll get the next one (I’m a very everything happens for a reason type of person) and I don’t let little things get me upset. 

So now I’m wondering how did I let my life come to this?! Why the hell did I build an entire life with someone who is constantly nervous and hyperactive? My son when he is alone with me will mirror my behaviour, so he’s more laid back when I’m alone with him. But when his dad is around he acts like him and two of them drives me insane. I can deal with one but not two. 

Anyways. I know there are things I can do like wake up extra early on weekends and have my quiet mornings before they wake up. But that means I’d have to wake up at 6:30 am on weekends, which I don’t want to do , bc I do that all week. And dealing with someone who freaks out constantly over changes of plans is draining. I went on a trip with my mom, sister and my kid and it’s like something in me woke up and realized this is how trips should feel. Relaxed. I enjoyed it so much I didn’t want to go back home.

1m96u31,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1m96u31/ca_receptionist_at_a_medical_clinic_in_los/,[CA] Receptionist at a medical clinic in Los Angeles California wondering what my scope of responsibilities are,"Hello, I have a questions about scope of responsibility and what is appropriate for my role. I am currently working at a high volume solo-practitioner chiropractor's clinic in Los Angeles. The doctor has a pretty niche specialty that most chiropractors stay away from for potential liability reasons. I've been working here for a year and a half. Staff consist of me the receptionist/front office manager (the doctor sometimes refers to me as one or the other, but usually just goes with ""my office girl""), the doctor who owns the practice, my manager/back office manager who the doctor hired to save his practice, and the massage therapist we rent a room out to.

The doctor sees anywhere from 100 to 200 patients a week, with the average week being around 140 to 160. He sees patients for accident cases as well and works with a few lawyers, and about a third of his income is from disability patients.

So far my work includes: Checking patients in/out in the computer system, taking payments, logging those payments in the computer, scheduling patients, getting paperwork on new patients, answering phones, managing emails, writing off work notes, writing itemized receipts for patients, managing the massage therapists schedule, managing inventory (like tp, ink, paper, hand sanitizer etc), filling out medical forms for patients (like private insurance proof of disability forms), managing all steps of the disability application process for patients aside from giving them a diagnosis (I double check their application, fill out all fields of the doctor's portion, have him write the diagnosis, I then photocopy the hard copy and address the envelope and mail out the disability applications. When a patient needs to extend their disability I am the one who fills out and submits the supplemental certificate. In the month of June I did 19 applications/extensions, and so far in July I've done 11).

I also take care of the personal injury patient's intake paperwork, write x-ray/MRI prescriptions, write higher level of care referral letters and coordinate the patient handoff, produce the billing paperwork to send to the attorney, assemble the final report and bill (the doctor writes the final report but more often than not I have to edit them as he usually has glaring typos such as the wrong name or using the wrong pronouns or the wrong dates for the accidents or it's addressed to the wrong attorney). I'd say on average I'm submitting one final report and bill a week.

I also do things for the doctor like order/get his coffee every morning from the cafe next door, order and get his lunch form the same cafe, occasionally drop his dog off at his house if he's leaving straight from the office to go out with friends that night, sometimes pick him up or drop him off at a mechanic (he's a huge vintage car guy), sometimes schedule his dr appointments, I scheduled his dog's spay and vaccine appointment (the dog is a fixture of the office).

I am also responsible for cleaning the office; I'm supposed to sweep/mop once a week, wash all windows, clean the bathroom and mirrors, I take out the trash every day, bring the garbage cans in/out once a week, wipe down all surfaces with chlorox wipes. If I'm being honest I usually don't do this, as I don't have the time, so the office is often pretty grimy/messy. I'd say I'm able to do this once every two weeks.

My manager also expects zero inaccuracies in the patient check-in/out process. We do everything by hand with hard copies, including the appointment book, and she expects the sign-in sheet to be perfectly reflected in the appointment book. On the sign in sheet I need to highlight each patient whose visit has been logged into the EMR system, put a star next to their name if they made a payment that day, write on their payment receipt their name amount paid and what they purchased and have a checkmark to indicate it's been logged in the EMR system, if the patient is a minor write ""child"" next to their name, if the patient was a personal injury write ""PI"" next to their name, if the patient signed in with a nick-name correct the sign in sheet so it reflects the name they are under in the EMR system. I am also expected to write in the appointment book the full names of all the walk-in patients and note who were no-shows. If I'm being honest this process is killing my wrist, it takes a long time to handwrite every single walk in patient, we get around 10 walk-ins a day on average. If I forget to write ""child"" next to a minor, or accidentally mark a payment as a visa instead of a mastercard, or forget to put a patient's middle initial in their profile, or make a typo in any part of their account my manager gives me a write-up. She also writes me up for bigger mistakes, like if I miss that the patient forgot to sign our consent form or if I put their first name in the last name field and vice versa or neglect to get paperwork on an old return patient, but those are more reasonable. My manager expects me to double check my work once patient hours are over but I just don't have the time to do it to the level that she wants. I'm lucky if I can find the time to even double check it in the first place.

I get paid $25/hour with no benefits, including healthcare (when I adjust my salary for paying for my own health insurance it really comes out to $22/hour), and I'm supposed to be working 40 hours a week. I usually end up working somewhere around 45 to 50 hours a week, and I don't get paid for those extra hours as they don't track my hours.

Is this whack? It feels like I'm always in trouble for being behind on paperwork, or forgetting to do something the doctor asked me to do, or not realizing something was time-sensitive and deprioritizing it in favor of the day-to-day office tasks. This whole thing feels like I'm being taken advantage of, but I'd like to know to what degree. I tried asking ChatGPT but it just tells me what I want to hear, which is frustrating.

I’ve stopped blaming myself for this cycle and have started to just embrace it. When my body says it’s had enough and my tank is empty,I just need to give it time.

  Of all days to oversleep, why did it have to be today?

  Dragging myself out of bed, I stumbled into the bathroom, splashing cold water on my face in an attempt to wake up. Once I felt slightly more alert, I moved to my closet, pulling out a black hoodie and a pair of sweatpants. After slipping them on, I quietly stepped out of my room.

  The hallway of the pack house was eerily silent. Good. Just what I needed.

  I made my way through the main doors and out into the crisp morning air. My destination was clear.

  The graveyard.

  I walked in silence, my heart growing heavier with each step closer to my destination. When I finally reached a familiar grave, my legs gave out beneath me, and I sank to the ground. With trembling hands, I placed the flowers I had brought in front of the headstone.

  “Mom,” I whispered, my voice trembling.

  My eyes traced the name etched into the cold stone, a lump forming in my throat.

  “Thank you… for giving up your life for me,” I choked out, my vision blurring as tears threatened to fall.

  “Everyone says you were the bravest, the strongest…” My voice cracked, the tears falling freely now. “I wish I could remember you… even just a little.”

  Today was my coming-of-age ceremony, a day that should have been filled with joy and celebration. But all I felt was emptiness.

  “I’m scared, Mom… I’m so scared.”

  My shoulders shook as I sobbed, my fingers curling into the cold earth under me. “I don’t want to be alone anymore. I wish you were here,” I admitted brokenly. “To hold me, to comfort me…”

  As if in response to my grief, more tears spilled down my cheeks, falling onto the damp earth under me.

  “You were the best mom, even though I never got to know you,” I whispered, wiping my tears as I stood up. I took one last look at her grave before forcing myself to turn away. 

  Today marked a fresh start in my life—it was my coming-of-age ceremony. Guests from other packs would be here, and I had heard the Alpha King would be attending, probably searching for his mate.

  “Great,” I muttered sarcastically, grabbing a bottle of water from the kitchen before heading back to my room. I had no intention of dealing with anyone until the ceremony.

  Hours later, the distant sounds of preparation stirred me awake. With a groan, I dragged myself out of bed and into the shower, letting the hot water wash away the exhaustion clinging to me.

  After a long, hot shower, I sat before my dressing mirror, staring at my reflection. Today wasn’t just about the ceremony. It was my birthday too, mine and Olivia’s. But No matter how much effort I put into my appearance, I knew she would steal the spotlight, like she always did. But that didn’t matter, I was already used to it.

  I slipped into the dress and gasped as I looked at myself in the mirror. It fit perfectly.

  I took a deep breath, trying to steady my nerves as I stared at my reflection. The dress clung to my figure in all the right places, accentuating my curves. It was a deep shade of midnight blue, complementing my dark hair and pale complexion.

  For once, I felt… beautiful.

  But I knew it wouldn’t last.

  No matter what I wore, Olivia would always be the center of attention. My half-sister had a way of making sure all eyes were on her, as if the world revolved around her existence. And tonight would be no different.

  Still, I refused to let her ruin this for me. Today wasn’t just her birthday—it was mine too.

  Squaring my shoulders, I turned away from the mirror and grabbed my heels. Just as I was about to slip them on, a knock echoed through my door.

  “Raven, are you ready?” a familiar voice called from the other side. It was Maya, my best friend.

  “Yeah, coming,” I responded, slipping on my heels before heading to the door.

  Maya’s eyes widened as soon as she saw me. “Wow, Raven. You look stunning!”

  I felt a faint blush creep up my cheeks. “Thanks.”

  She grinned, looping her arm through mine. “Let’s go. The ceremony’s about to start.”

  My heart raced as we descended the stairs, the pack house buzzing with excitement. The air was filled with the scent of delicious food, and laughter echoed through the halls. Warriors from neighboring packs mingled with our own, but the room’s energy shifted the moment we entered the main hall.

  A powerful aura radiated from the far end of the room, suffocating and intense. My eyes darted around the room, and my heart skipped a beat when my eyes fell on a certain figure.

  The Alpha King was here.

  I swallowed hard, my pulse quickening. 

  His presence was suffocating, his dominance palpable even from across the room. His sharp, chiseled features were framed by jet-black hair, his piercing green eyes scanning the crowd with a predatory intensity.

  Stories of his ruthlessness, his unmatched power, and the fact that he was still unmated circulated through every pack. Many she-wolves dreamed of being chosen by him.

  But not me.

  All I wanted was to get through tonight without drawing attention.

  The ceremony began, the pack elders chanting as they circled the ceremonial fire in. My heart thudded painfully in my chest.

  Maya gave my hand a reassuring squeeze. “You’ve got this,” she whispered.

  But instead of calling me first, Olivia was called. I was the elder sister. It should have been me.

  My frown deepened as Olivia stepped forward, the elders beaming at her as if she was the only one who mattered.

  The applause was thunderous. Wolves whispered about how graceful she was, how radiant. As if I didn’t exist.

  Feeling already irritated, I bolted out, anger bubbling inside me as I walked back to my room.

  I didn’t need them. I didn’t need any of them. I could transform on my own.

  When I got into the room, I bolted the door and started my transformation.

  The air buzzed with energy, and a strange heat spread through my limbs. My skin tingled as a deep pull in my core signaled the shift beginning. I clenched my teeth as pain rippled through me, my bones stretching and reforming. My nails elongated into claws, my spine arched, and a low growl escaped my lips.

  I collapsed onto my hands and knees as fur sprouted along my arms and legs. The pain was unlike anything I had ever felt, burning through my veins like fire and ice at the same time. My breathing grew ragged, my vision blurred, and just when I thought I couldn’t take it anymore—

  Everything snapped into place.

  I stood on four legs, my senses sharper than ever before. I walked over to my dressing mirror to see my inner self, and standing before me was a red wolf, her eyes glowing fiercely. And to be honest… I was breathtaking.

  For the first time, I felt powerful. Beautiful.

  Pride swelled in my chest, but before I could fully embrace my new form, an unfamiliar scent filled my nose, alluring and intoxicating.

  My heart raced, my wolf howling excitedly.

  “Mate.”

# Mate

Raven’s POV

  “Mate,” my wolf howled again. 

  My heart stuttered, then raced as her words sank in. Could it be? Was my mate here, in the pack house?

  The thought sent a rush of excitement through me as my wolf urged me to go check. I shifted back into my human form, and this time, the pain wasn’t as unbearable. I quickly went to my closet, searching for a dress, as the one I wore had been torn during my shifting. I settled for a black dress that fell just below my knees. Taking one last glance at my reflection, I stepped out of my room, following the intoxicating scent that was pulling me forward.

  The scent was leading me toward the grand hall, where our coming-of-age ceremony was being held. My heart pounded in sync with my wolf’s excitement. Could it be that one of the guests was my mate? The closer I got, the stronger the scent became.

  As I stepped into the grand hall, my breath hitched. The air was thick with the scent of different wolves, laughter, and the sound of glasses clinking, but I barely noticed any of it.

  I was searching for him.

  Then, my gaze locked onto a figure and my entire world came to a halt.

  The moment his gaze met mine, everything around us blurred—the noise, the music, the people.

  “Mate,” my wolf purred, and I felt the undeniable pull toward him.

  His jaw clenched, his eyes narrowing as he inhaled deeply, his broad chest rising and falling. Did he feel it too? Did his wolf recognize me the way mine recognized him?

  I took a step forward, ready to go to him, when loud clapping and cheers erupted from the crowd. Confused, I tore my gaze away from him, turning toward the source of the noise.

  The crowd had parted, forming a path leading toward him. My eyes followed the movement, and my heart dropped.

  There, walking gracefully toward him, was Olivia.

  Her radiant smile was matched only by the joyful tears glistening in her eyes. She moved with an elegance that captivated everyone’s attention, including his. I watched in stunned silence as she approached him, her arms wrapping around his waist.

  My heart shattered as I saw him respond. His face softened, his arms encircling her protectively. He looked down at her, his eyes warm and tender. A loving smile graced his lips as he leaned down, his forehead touching hers.

  My entire body went numb. “What is happening?” I asked my wolf, but she didn’t respond. Desperation clawed at my chest, so I turned to a nearby maid.

  “What’s going on?” I asked, my voice tight and my brow furrowed.

  She blinked at me, surprised. “Oh, you don’t know? Your sister found her mate.”

  I frowned. “Mate?” I echoed, my voice trembling.

  The maid nodded, smiling. “Aren’t you happy for her?”

  I couldn’t reply. I couldn’t breathe.

  I was taken aback by what had just happened. Could it be that my wolf was mistaken? I turned back to look at Olivia and the Alpha King.

  My mate.

  I stumbled backward, my breath coming in short gasps as the weight of those words sank in.

  No.

  This couldn’t be happening.

  My wolf whimpered, but she remained eerily silent. The bond that had just ignited inside me felt like it was being strangled before it could fully form. My heart ached, and my hands trembled at my sides as I watched Olivia smile up at him—my mate.

  The Alpha King.

  His eyes found mine again, and for a brief, torturous moment, I saw the conflict swirling within them. His jaw tightened, his fingers twitching at his side as if he were fighting the urge to reach for me. But Olivia’s laughter pulled him back, she clung to him, her delicate fingers resting against his chest possessively.

  I wanted to scream. I wanted to demand answers. But I couldn’t. Not here. Not now.

  I turned and ran.

  Murmurs followed me, whispers questioning my sudden exit, but I didn’t care. The grand hall blurred as I pushed through the doors, stepping into the cold night air. My lungs burned, my vision clouded by unshed tears.

  Was I wrong? Did I imagine the pull?

  No. I felt it. My wolf felt it.

  So why was my mate standing beside my sister?

  The pain was unbearable, a searing agony spreading through my chest. I clutched my arms around myself, stumbling toward my room.

  I reached my room, shutting the door behind me before collapsing onto my bed, sobbing. How had my life turned out like this? She had taken everything from me—my father’s love, the pack’s admiration, and now… my mate.

  Why, Olivia?

  Why did she always take everything from me?

  Fresh tears spilled down my cheeks. I wanted to scream, to break something, to demand answers—but what good would that do? No one ever listened to me. No one ever chose me.

  A soft knock at my door made me tense. I quickly wiped my tears and sat up, trying to compose myself. I hesitated before opening the door, and to my surprise, I found my father standing there.

  It had been years since I last saw him here.

  He walked past me into the room, the silence stretching between us before he finally spoke.

  “Your sister found her mate,” he said, his voice devoid of emotion.

  I scoffed. “Her mate? She stole mine,” I spat, my tone dripping with anger.

  His face remained expressionless, as if he already knew. “You have to let your sister be mated to him.” His tone left no room for argument.

  But I knew better than to stay silent. “Or I should tell him,” I challenged.

  “Tell who?” he asked sharply.

  “The Alpha King, of course,” I snapped.

  His expression darkened. “You will do no such thing.”

  “Watch me,” I countered, turning to leave the room.

  But before I could take another step, my father grabbed my arm and yanked me back.

  His gaze hardened. “You were never meant to have him, Raven. Accept it and stay silent. You will not tell anyone what happened if you still want to live,” he warned. “And for the time being, you will be locked up.”

  I gasped as he turned on his heel and walked out, leaving me stunned.

  Soon I heard the click of the door lock.

  He knew all along.

  I sank to the floor, tears flowing freely as I whispered, “He knew all along.”

  Suddenly, a sharp pain struck my heart, and I clutched my chest, gasping as the pain intensified.

  “What’s happening?” I whimpered to no one in particular. I rolled onto the ground, the pain unbearable.

  “Mate,” my wolf howled inside me, her voice filled with anguish.

  Then I realized.

  He was mating with my sister.

# Must Leave

Raven’s POV

  I clutched my chest as if that would ease the unbearable pain crushing me from the inside. My breath came in short gasps, and my vision blurred with the flood of tears spilling down my cheeks. My mate. The one the Moon Goddess has destined for me, was leaving, and he was leaving with my sister.

  How could he not feel the bond? How could he not sense me the way I sensed him? My wolf whimpered in my mind, still silent and withdrawn, as if the betrayal had shattered her spirit just as much as it had mine. She hadn't spoken to me since the moment I saw him standing next to Olivia, his hand resting protectively on her lower back. That touch was mine. He was mine. 

  I dragged myself up from the floor, my hands trembling as I gripped the edge of my bed. The window was still open, and the cold night air did nothing to soothe the fire of rage and heartbreak burning inside me. I forced myself to watch, even though it felt like my heart was being ripped out of my chest with every passing second.

  Olivia turned, her face glowing with excitement as she wrapped her arms around him. He leaned in and whispered something in her ear, making her laugh. My stomach twisted violently. That laugh was supposed to be mine. Those whispered words—meant only for me. My nails dug into my palms, the pain grounding me even as my world crumbled.

  I wanted to scream, to run outside and tell him. Tell him the truth. That Olivia was nothing more than a thief, a liar, a traitor. That I was his fated mate, not her. That he was mine.

  But I couldn’t.

  My father made sure of that.

  His warning echoed in my mind like a sinister whisper: “Stay quiet, Raven. You don't deserve him. Olivia is the perfect Luna, not you.”

  I had wanted to fight back, to tell him that he was mistaken. That the bond wasn’t something he could change with a few cruel words and manipulation. But the look in his eyes told me he wouldn’t listen. He had already made his decision, already chosen Olivia over me. His real daughter. His real heir.

  I clenched my jaw, my whole body trembling as the car pulled away from the pack house, the sound of the tires against the gravel fading into the night. A piece of me left with them. A piece I would never get back.

  A sob escaped my lips, raw and broken. My wolf whimpered again, but still refused to surface. I needed her. I needed her strength. But she was just as lost as I was.

  I felt sick.

  Betrayal wrapped around me like chains, suffocating, and heavy. My own father had handed over my mate to her. My own blood. The sister who had never once treated me like family, who had taken everything from me since the moment we were born. And now, she had taken the one thing that was truly mine.

  I stumbled away from the window, my knees buckling beneath me as I collapsed onto my bed. My hands fisted the blankets, my nails digging into the fabric as I let out a silent scream. Why?

  Why didn’t he feel it? Why didn’t he look at me the way I looked at him? The way Olivia looked at him—like he was hers?

  Had the Goddess made a mistake?

  No. No, she wouldn’t. The bond wasn’t something that could be faked. He was mine. I was meant to be by his side, not Olivia. But she had taken him. They had taken him.

  And I had let them.

  My body shook violently as the reality of my situation sank in. I had nothing left.

  No mate. No family.

  Just pain.

  Tears soaked my pillow as I curled into myself, my breath coming in ragged gasps. My chest ached with a hollowness I had never felt before. And for the first time in my life, I realized something that sent a shiver down my spine.

  I wasn’t just heartbroken.

  I was alone.

  And I had no one except my wolf.

  Then I heard the door creak open. I was reluctant to move. I buried my face in the pillow as the door burst open. I felt footsteps approaching my bed, so I raised my head to see my father, a smile on his face.

  “What do you want, Father?” I yelled at him, the first time I had ever done that—but at this point, I didn’t care. He was a stranger to me.

  He took a long breath before speaking. “I just came to see how you are doin...”

  “Or came to see if I was broken by your betrayal?” I spat at him, cutting off his sentence.

  My father’s smile didn’t falter, but his eyes darkened slightly, a flicker of something unreadable passing through them. He took a step closer, his towering presence making the room feel even smaller.

  “You should watch your tone, Raven,” he said smoothly, as if he wasn’t the one responsible for my suffering. As if he hadn’t just handed over my mate like I was nothing.

  I sat up, my hands gripping the sheets tightly. “Or what?” My voice was hoarse, laced with pain. “You’ve already taken everything from me. What more could you possibly do?”

  His lips curved into a smirk, but there was no warmth in it. “You act like this is the end, but it’s not. You’re stronger than you think, Raven. You’ll learn to accept your place.”

  “My place?” I let out a bitter laugh, shaking my head. “And where exactly is that, Father? In the shadows? Watching my mate love someone else? Watching my so-called family betray me over and over again?”

  He sighed, feigning disappointment. “Olivia was always meant to be Luna. You were never fit for the role, and you know it.”

  A growl rumbled in my throat, my wolf stirring faintly at his words. I wasn’t fit? I had trained harder than Olivia ever had. And yet, none of it mattered. Because in his eyes, I was never good enough.

  “Why?” My voice cracked as I looked into the face of the man who was supposed to protect me. “Why do you hate me so much?”

  For a moment—just a moment—something flickered in his expression. Guilt? Regret? But it was gone instantly, replaced by cold indifference.

  “You were never meant to be here,” he said simply, as if those words didn’t cut me deeper than any blade ever could. “Now, stop this pathetic display. Olivia and your mate will be happy together, and you will stay out of their way. Do you understand me?”

  Rage burned through me, hotter than ever before. I wanted to lash out, to scream, to make him hurt the way he had hurt me. But I knew it wouldn’t matter. Nothing I did would ever matter to him.

  I swallowed the lump in my throat, my nails digging into my palms. “Get out.”

  I yelled at him, my voice sharp and raged. “And don’t you dare think you have a daughter named Raven from now on,” I spat, hatred evident in my voice.

  He tilted his head slightly, as if contemplating my reaction, then let out a small chuckle. “As you wish.”

  He turned and walked toward the door, pausing only once to glance over his shoulder.

  “You’ll see, Raven. This is for the best.”

  And then he was gone.

  I stared at the closed door, my body trembling with barely contained emotion.

  How was he able to do it? How did my father and Olivia manipulated the mate bond? This was something I need to investigate But first, I needed to escape, I must leave this pack, and I will leave tonight.

# Mate Bond

Alpha Ethan’s POV

  Five Years Later

  I woke up to the early morning sun streaming through my window. Slowly, I opened my eyes, got out of bed, and drew the curtains closed. My gaze drifted to the sleeping Olivia, and I sighed. It had been five years since we were mated. Five long years.

  I walked into the bathroom, brushed my teeth, and took a cold shower. When I stepped out, a towel wrapped around my waist, I returned to the room, only to find the bed empty. Olivia was already gone. Shaking my head, I went to my closet, pulled out a heavy blue suit, and slipped it on. The fabric fit perfectly, accentuating my broad shoulders and muscular frame. I adjusted my tie, ran a hand through my slightly damp hair, and stepped out of the room.

  As I descended the stairs, the rich aroma of food filled the air, making me pause. This wasn’t the usual scent of meals prepared by the maids. My mind immediately went to Olivia. Could she be the one cooking? The thought almost made me laugh. Olivia never cooked. She never cared whether I had breakfast or not.

  Curiosity got the best of me, and I decided to check the kitchen. Maybe she had changed.

  But as soon as I stepped inside, my hope was crushed. Elisa stood at the stove instead. I sighed.

  She turned at the sound of my footsteps, a warm smile on her face. “Good morning, brother.”

  I frowned. “You didn’t tell me you were coming back.”

  Elisa chuckled. “Chill, big brother. I wanted to surprise you, and I did, didn’t I?”

  I smirked. “So, tell me, how did you do it?”

  “You should already know. Didn’t you come here because of my cooking?” she teased, flipping an omelet onto a plate.

  A brief silence settled between us before I broke it. “I thought she was the one cooking,” I admitted, frustration lacing my voice.

  “She?” Elisa asked, her brow raised, but I didn’t respond.

  “Olivia?” she guessed.

  “Who else?” I muttered.

  Elisa sighed, shaking her head as she turned off the stove. “You should know by now that Olivia has never been the type to cook,” she said, disappointment evident in her voice.

  I ran a hand down my face, exhaling sharply. “I know,” I admitted, taking a seat at the kitchen counter. “It’s been five years, Elisa. Five damn years, and I still don’t feel the mate bond the way I’m supposed to. I thought it would grow, that maybe, with time, I’d feel something stronger. But every day, I wake up, and it feels… forced. Like I’m just going through the motions.”

  Elisa placed the plate in front of me, her expression unreadable. “Then why are you still holding on?” she asked, crossing her arms.

  I scoffed, picking up my fork but barely touching the food. “Because the bond is supposed to be sacred. Rejecting her after all these years would make me look weak. I thought maybe I was the problem. Maybe I wasn’t trying hard enough.” I clenched my jaw. “But regardless of what I do, Olivia is still the same. Cold. Distant. And when she does speak to me, it’s with nothing but irritation or demands. She barely acknowledges me unless she needs something.”

  Elisa sat across from me, her blue eyes filled with sympathy. “I’ve noticed,” she admitted. “She treats the pack like they’re beneath her, Ethan. Even the omegas fear her. She acts entitled, as if being Luna means everyone should serve her, but she gives nothing in return. You deserve more than that.”

  I let out a humorless chuckle. “Tell that to the elders. They believe Olivia is the perfect Luna. That she’s strong, independent, and exactly what this pack needs. If I go against that, I’ll have to justify rejecting my own mate. And honestly? I don’t even know where to start.”

  Elisa tapped my shoulder. “Then don’t force it.”

  Her words hit harder than I expected because deep down, I knew she was right. I had spent five years convincing myself that love would come, that the mate bond would eventually make everything right. But love couldn’t be forced. And whatever I had with Olivia—it was nothing like the stories I had grown up believing.

  I sighed, pushing my plate aside.

  Elisa hesitated before speaking again. “Be honest with yourself. And with Olivia. If she’s truly your mate, then ask yourself—why does she make you feel so empty?”

  I stared at my sister, her words settling deep into my bones. Olivia and I were bound by a mate bond, but it felt more like a chain than a connection. Every day with her was a reminder of what we lacked—what I lacked. Passion. Warmth. Love.

  Before I could respond, the sharp sound of heels clicking against the floor echoed through the hallway. A moment later, Olivia stepped into the kitchen, dressed in an elegant black dress that hugged her figure perfectly. Her hair was styled to perfection, and her makeup was flawless. She looked every bit the Luna the pack admired.

  But to me, she was nothing more than a stranger.

  Her sharp brown eyes flickered to me, then to Elisa. “What are you two talking about?” she asked, suspicion laced in her tone.

  I scoffed. “Is that how you greet your husband?” I spat in anger, my wolf silent but angry at her.

  Elisa, however, decided to speak. “We were just discussing how the mate bond is supposed to bring two people closer, not push them apart.”

  Olivia scoffed, flipping her hair over her shoulder. “The mate bond is what it is. We don’t have to be sickeningly in love, like some foolishly believe. We have an understanding, Ethan. That should be enough.”

  I clenched my jaw. “An understanding?” My voice was sharp, my patience thinning. “That’s all you have to say?”

  She crossed her arms. “Yes. You lead the pack. I stand by your side. We don’t need to pretend to be something we’re not.”

  I slammed my palm against the counter, making both Olivia and Elisa flinch. My wolf growled inside me, my dominance radiating through the room. “You are my mate, and you should act like it,” I snapped, my voice dangerously low.

  For five years, I had sacrificed my own happiness, waiting for her to change. But hell no—she only got worse.

  For the first time in a long while, Olivia hesitated. A flicker of nervousness crossed her face, but it vanished as quickly as it came. “Then that’s your problem,” she said smoothly, reaching for a cup of coffee.

  But I was faster. I grabbed her wrist, pulling her back. “You don’t walk out on me,” I growled. “I’m not just your mate—I’m your Alpha. And you will respect that.”

  I released her hand, making her lose her balance. She stumbled back and fell to the floor. 

  Just then, the door burst open. One of the guards on patrol ran in, gasping for breath.

  “Alpha,” he panted, worry in his eyes. “We’re under attack.”

# Rough Attack

Alpha Ethan's POV

“A rough attack,” I muttered to myself as I took in the chaos unfolding before me. The scent of blood tainted the air, mixing with the heavy aroma of damp earth and burning wood. The night had been eerily calm before the first howl shattered the silence, signaling the beginning of an invasion.

Without hesitation, I mind-linked my Beta, James. We’re under attack. Assemble all warriors immediately. We need everyone on the front lines—no exceptions.

James responded instantly, his voice sharp and alert. Understood, Alpha. How many are we dealing with?

I surveyed the battleground, my keen eyes picking up the swift-moving shadows in the tree line. More than a dozen, perhaps more, but something tells me this is just the beginning.  I sense more waiting beyond the trees. Move fast, James.

On it, he confirmed before cutting the link.

My claws elongated instinctively as I stepped forward, my wolf clawing beneath my skin, eager to be unleashed. I turned toward my Gamma, Caleb, who was already shifting, his powerful black wolf standing ready beside me.

“Hold the eastern flank,” I ordered, my voice laced with authority. “We cannot let them break through. If they do, the pack house will be vulnerable.”

Caleb growled in agreement before taking off, his massive form disappearing into the darkness.

A piercing snarl rang through the night as the first wave of rogues lunged forward, their eyes gleaming with savage hunger. I met them head-on, shifting mid-leap into my wolf form. My bones cracked and rearranged, fur bursting from my skin as I landed on all fours, fangs bared. The first rogue made the mistake of rushing me blindly—I clamped my jaws around its throat, snapping its windpipe with ease before tossing the lifeless body aside.

More followed, their movements frenzied and erratic. These weren’t ordinary rogues; they fought with an unsettling coordination, their attacks calculated. I barely had a moment to register this before three of them pounced at once. Twisting my body, I used their momentum against them, knocking two unbalanced while sinking my teeth into the third’s hind leg. A pained yelp filled the air as I dragged the rogue down, tearing into its flesh until it stopped moving.

Through the haze of battle, James’ voice rang in my mind again. Warriors are assembled and moving into position. We have around seventy on the field now, but I sent a distress call to the allied packs. If this is an organized assault, we’ll need reinforcements.

Good. We hold our ground until they arrive, I replied, dodging a rogue’s snapping jaws. I retaliated with a brutal swipe of my claws, shredding across its face.

Shouts and snarls filled the air as our warriors clashed with the rogues. The night pulsed with the violent symphony of battle—bodies colliding, bones crunching, pained cries echoing into the darkness. My pack fought fiercely, but the rogues kept coming, their numbers seemingly endless.

Then, from the shadows beyond the tree line, a figure emerged—a tall, imposing man, his scent foreign yet oddly familiar. Unlike the rogues, he didn’t charge into battle. Instead, he stood still, his piercing gaze locked onto me.

A growl rumbled deep in my chest as I took a step forward, readying myself. Whoever he was, he wasn’t just another rogue.

This attack wasn’t random. It was planned.

And the real fight was just beginning.

The rogue in front of me lunged, but I was faster. I slammed my weight into it, sending it crashing into the dirt before snapping its neck. Blood sprayed the ground as I turned to face the next attacker.

We were holding our ground, but barely. The rogues were relentless, their numbers growing instead of thinning. James and Caleb fought fiercely beside me, but I could see exhaustion beginning to creep into their movements. Our warriors were strong, but the onslaught was wearing us down.

Then, just as a massive rogue barreled toward me, something changed. A powerful presence rippled through the battlefield, a force unlike anything I had felt before. The air grew thick with energy, and for a moment, even the rogues hesitated.

A golden blur shot through the darkness, its movements swift and lethal. The massive wolf landed in front of me, its golden fur gleaming even under the dim moonlight. It moved with an otherworldly grace, its eyes burning with an intensity that made even the most savage rogues falter.

I had never seen this wolf before.

And yet, something about it felt familiar.

The golden wolf wasted no time, launching itself into the fray with devastating efficiency. It tore through the enemy lines, its powerful jaws crushing bones, its claws slicing through flesh like they were nothing. The rogues scrambled to defend themselves, but they were no match.

I took advantage of the shift in momentum, throwing myself back into the fight. With renewed strength, my warriors pushed forward, cutting down the remaining rogues with ruthless precision.

The battle that had seemed unwinnable only moments ago now turned in our favor.

The golden wolf fought as if it had a personal vendetta against the rogues, its movements precise and brutal. It struck down every enemy in its path, leaving a trail of bodies in its wake.

When we were done fighting, she stood before me, but just as I was about to shift and ask who she was, she pushed past me, causing me to stumble and fall to the ground. When I turned, I saw her fighting with a rogue.

I was stunned.

Did she just save me?

The fight between them was rough. I wanted to help, but I couldn’t. She brought out her fangs, biting into the other wolf, and it growled in pain before collapsing to the ground. When she raised her head, her mouth was full of blood.

Just then, I saw a bullet coming toward her from behind.

“Watch out!” I shouted.

But before she could react, the bullet pierced into her chest from behind.

“No!” I shouted as she fell to the ground.

# Our Saviour

Alpha Ethan's POV

“Bring a blanket,” I ordered my Beta, who quickly complied. I covered her up, staring at her unconscious body, blood rushing from the shot where the bullet had penetrated. I pulled off my shirt, using it to wrap around the wound, temporarily stopping the blood flow while I ordered a car to take us back to the pack house. As I waited, I could feel the weight of the situation pressing down on me as I watched her—her long black hair matted with blood, her body lifeless and barely hanging on. The bullet wound was bad, and I had no idea how much time we had. My hands shook slightly as I tightened the makeshift bandage, my mind racing with thoughts of what could’ve been if we hadn’t arrived in time.

I glanced up, finding my Beta standing nearby, ready to follow any order. “The car should be here soon,” he said, but I barely heard him. My gaze lingered on the woman who had saved my pack, who had saved us all. She was the last person I expected to see in this condition.

Her face, though obscured by the mess of hair, still held a certain quiet strength. Even unconscious, there was something powerful about her presence. I couldn’t stop myself from wondering who she really was—what had driven her to risk everything for a pack she didn’t belong to? My heart clenched, a mixture of gratitude and confusion swirling inside me.

The car pulled up, and I gently lifted her into my arms, cradling her against me, trying to keep her as still as possible. My mind kept circling back to her—who was she? And why had she been the one to fight for us when no one else had?

I couldn’t stop my thoughts from spiraling as I made my way into the pack house, her body still in my arms. The healer was already standing by, waiting for us with a grim expression that mirrored my own. There wasn’t time to waste. Every second felt like it might be the last one we had.

I gently laid her down on the examination table, making sure her body was as comfortable as possible, even in this fragile state. The healer quickly stepped forward, her hands expertly moving over the wound, her eyes sharp with focus.

“Her blood pressure is dangerously low,” the healer muttered, her brow furrowing as she inspected the wound. “We need to act fast, Alpha. The bullet’s still in there, and it’s causing more damage than we thought.”

I nodded, my throat tight. I wasn’t sure if I could even breathe right now. The woman lying before me wasn’t just some stranger—I could feel it deep in my bones. She was important. But why? My mind kept reaching for answers that weren’t there.

“How long until we can stabilize her?” I asked, trying to mask the panic that threatened to rise. I had to be strong. I had to stay in control, but it was hard when everything inside me was screaming.

The healer didn’t look up from her work, but her voice was steady. “It’ll take some time. I need to get the bullet out first, then we can start to address the blood loss. But with this much damage…"" She trailed off, glancing up at me, her eyes filled with quiet concern.

I clenched my fists. “Do whatever it takes. She's not dying. Not on my watch.”

The healer nodded sharply, and I turned away, pacing the room, my mind a whirlwind of frustration and guilt. I should’ve done something sooner. I should’ve protected her. But no matter how many times I replayed the events in my head, I couldn’t change what had already happened.

My Beta, who had been waiting quietly in the corner, stepped forward. “Alpha, do you want me to send for backup? For more help?” he asked quietly.

I shook my head. “No. We’ll handle it here. I’ll stay with her.”

I couldn’t leave her. Not now. Something inside me had shifted the moment I saw her lying there—vulnerable, fighting for life. She wasn’t just some warrior who happened to show up at the right time. There was something more to her. Something I needed to understand.

The healer moved with practiced precision, cutting away the fabric of her clothes around the wound and carefully beginning the process of removing the bullet. I couldn’t tear my gaze away from her face. Her skin was pale, and I could see the faintest flush of fever creeping in, but still, there was that strength in her expression, even in unconsciousness. It was like she was fighting something deeper than just this injury.

The healer muttered under her breath as she worked, trying to stabilize her vital signs. I could feel the weight of each moment pressing down on me.

Minutes dragged on, and with every passing second, I felt like the distance between us grew, the questions swirling inside me intensifying. Who was she? What was she really doing here? And most of all—why did it feel like I had known her for so much longer than I actually had?

Finally, the healer spoke, her voice soft but relieved. “The bullet’s out. We’re stabilizing her now. She’s not out of danger yet, but she’s got a chance.”

A wave of relief washed over me, but it was fleeting. I wasn’t sure if I could ever truly relax until I saw her awake again, heard her voice, and felt the warmth of her presence return. But for now, all I could do was wait.

Just then, Olivia barged into the room. When her eyes landed on the girl, her brow furrowed, and I could tell she was shocked, but I didn’t know why. “We have to talk,” she said, pulling me out of the room. “What is that girl doing here?” she asked the moment we were out of the room.

“She saved us and got injured. So the least I could do was keep her here until she recovers.”

“She is not staying here,” she muttered, but I heard her clearly.

“And why wouldn’t she stay?” I asked, my voice laced with anger.

She didn’t reply immediately. “I don’t like her, and she should be out,” she said.

“And who are you to tell me what to do? A mate who doesn’t know her duties to her mate, huh?” I spat angrily.

“You know what? I wish that girl lying there was my mate and not…” I snapped angrily and walked out. **Enjoyed it? Upvote and comment! Want the full story? Say so below and I’ll try my best to post it ASP.**",2,1753467657.0,NovelNexus,3,1.0,False

Anaiah's POV

My name is Anaiah Ross. I'm the most undesired wolf in the pack because when I shifted into my wolf for the first time, I ended Tomas Rivers, our Alpha's brother, who attempted to do bad things to me.

Tomas Rivers was a pedophile who used to touch me in the most inappropriate way when no one was watching. That's why I'm not sorry I ended him.

Since that day, the pack has been mistreating and bullying me. They beat, starve me and make me clean the pack house day in and day out. I tried to tell them that it was only self-defense but they didn't believe me. Tomas's wife, Leah, denied all the accusations and said that her husband was the perfect man, but I know she knows the truth.

Even my parents turned their backs on me because, after the murder, they were demoted from their Gamma status to Omegas. Omegas are considered the weakest link of the pack, others are strong, but most of them are just cleaners and help out around the pack. They have no major role to play, like fighting in wars or any important pack political business.

""Where is that woman!"" Leah sneers. I roll my eyes because of everyone here, she makes my life horrible. I was supposed to be banished after I ended Tomas but my parents pleaded and asked on my behalf, saying that it was my first shift and just lost control.

I get out of my tiny room, it is very small and has almost an old walk-in closet, next to the store room on the second floor. There is a mattress and an old broken mirror. I only have a few clothes, shoes, and a collection of my favorite books.

I get out of the room, mentally preparing myself for all the insults and beating I'm to receive. I groan. Once in the main room, I see Leah standing elegantly in a long dress and heels, one hand on her hip as she taps her feet against the floor in impatience, the other hand holding a yellow fabric that she throws in my face as soon as I'm at arm's reach. I remove it from my face and throw it on the floor, annoyed.

""Um..."" I trail pointing at the dress on the floor. Leah looks livid now and I didn't expect her to slap me, no, I did. She slaps me hard across my face and red splatters from my nose as I fell to the ground from the impact of her slap. She kicks me once again in the stomach and I grunt.

""I told you to hand wash it!"" She yells. I cover my face with my arms as my face blows after blow. It has been like this since her husband died and I'm here to take all her dislike.

I picked myself up from the floor after Leah was tired of beating me. I go to the Omega bathroom to clean my body, the cold water hits my body and I shiver. Slowly, I clean my body and leave the bathroom, using the lotion I left there and wearing the clothes I wore earlier. I am going to get started on breakfast. The packed house has over 100 people staying here, they live in luxurious suites with their families, while others who are unmatched or without families have designer rooms.

With only a few other Omegas to help me, I prepared breakfast. There are sausages, bacon, toast, eggs, and beans, they eat a full English breakfast every morning. I start to serve when I see him, Amos, he's our future Alpha and one of the strongest wolves there is, he's a big player and a Cassanova. But I still have a small crush on him.

He mostly irritates me and bullies me like others. The last time I spilled coffee on his girlfriend Eunice, he slapped me. My wolf wanted to fight back but I knew he could end our lives in an instant.

Amos's eyes met mine and he visibly stiffened and widened his eyes. I ignore his weird behavior and continue serving breakfast. Ignoring all the snarky comments they are throwing my way. I look at my parents but they only look at me with disgust and dislike in their gaze. I swallow and inhale, walking away sadly. Tears were well in my eyes but I didn't cry. I can't be weak. I need to leave this place once I'm eighteen and start a new life for myself, so I promised myself to be strong. I will survive, I will take all the beating.

'Don't worry, our mate will love us,' beams my wolf, Chalo.

A mate is a soulmate that completes a wolf's life. Once they are in pain, it is felt by the other and my wolf has been wanting to get one since we learned what mates are, and she believes he will save us from all the pain and torture. He will love us forever and we will have a beautiful family I didn't have.

I see a few students going to school and I smile. I miss school even though all they did was prank me, but my teachers were good to me because I was a straight A student and would win most competitions. The Alpha and Luna stopped my education in my sophomore year because they said they can't waste their resources on me when all I'm good for is cleaning and cooking, plus, let's face it, I wasn't going to get into a good college.

After I was done with my chores, I decided to get some vitamin D outside as my skin was too pale due to being indoors. I smile when the sun hits my skin and my wolf purrs. I hid in the bleachers while watching the warriors of the pack train. I like to observe them while they train so that I can know some basics about defending myself.

The Dawnrise is not the strongest there is and has survived this far by maintaining a good relationship with other strong packs like the Lycans who are royalty to us. Dawnrise's worst fear is angering a stronger pack. Hence, every year, they hold a ceremony to renew their treaties where they feast and celebrate alliances that were made many years ago.

I feel a hand roughly grab my hair from behind and I fall on my back facing the sky. Eunice is standing over me, her arms crossed over her chest with a triumphant smile on her face. I scowl and try to get up, but a kick in my stomach stops me. She and her two bimbos hit me several times and she snarls.

""Don't make eye contact with my boyfriend again!""

**Chapter 2 The Dungeon, The Rejection**

Anaiah's POV

I cough, making my ribs hurt. My wolf is trying to help me heal quickly, but since we don't shift as much as the others, my healing is not as good as other wolves.

I get up to my feet with so much difficulty, but she kicks my legs and I fall back down, she puts her heel over my neck, and I close my eyes, waiting for the worst.

""What I have to do is press a little harder and I can take you out of your misery,"" She says in that annoying tone of hers. My heart is beating so fast and my wolf is growling menacingly even though she can't fight back in this situation, she has a strong fighting spirit and most times has given in to me, but I know when to quit and she doesn't. I don't want to die.

My wolf, Chalo, resurfaces, and, using her strength, I kick Eunice in the legs so that she is on the ground. Those weak women minions of hers scream, scared, but no one tries to stop me. Anger courses through me, I feel the adrenaline pumping through me and I hover over her, punching her face repeatedly. Soon, the men that were training surrounded us. Others were cheering while others are telling her to beat me, but I know, Eunice, she only barks and has had no bite since we were young.

A tingling sensation rushes down my skin as I feel myself being lifted off Eunice's body by huge strong hands but my wolf is not done with her yet, so I kick and scream.

""Let me go!"" I scream at whoever is carrying me away from there. I jump off the shoulder of the man who carries me and am ready to punch him in the face, but I'm taken back to see it is Amos, the Alpha's son. He looks so attracting  in his basketball shorts, his hair is disheveled, and  his chest is so attracting . I can see his muscular body and I swallow thickly. Seeing that I'm staring, he smirks at me and I blush involuntarily, looking away from him.

""Causing trouble, Omega?"" He says in an angry voice.

""She came at me first!"" I retorted.

""You'll be punished for what you did. Do you know who she is?"" He growls, pushing me against the tree. I wince at the pain in my back. He wraps his hand around my neck and chokes me

""She's your Luna,"" he grits.

I try to hit him but he doesn't let go. It's like hitting a wall, my oxygen starts to cut and until all energy has left me, he finally lets me go and I fall to the ground, inhaling as much air as I can.

He crouches down next to me and looks at me with a softness I've never seen before while I glare at him. His eyes turn a shade darker and I know he is linking with someone. When he's done, he clears his throat and orders.

""You will be locked in the dungeon for the coming days,"" I widen my eyes in horror.

""But she started it!"" I croak, I've been in the dungeons a few times and It's not a place I like to be, it's dark and scary, and the guards there are the most immoral while they beat the offenders. They assault women they like. It has happened to me a few times, but I wasn't raped.

He stands up to leave but turns to look at me, ""Before I forget, I Amos Rivers, reject you, Anaiah Ross, as my mate and future Luna.""

I was in shock and his words kept repeating in my head. I didn't say anything or even react. Amos was my mate, he's twenty-four years old, so he knew all along that we were mated but watched them beat and abuse me.

Amos is standing over me with no emotions on his face, no remorse whatsoever.

""Guards!""

A few guards ran to us, bowing before the Alphas. Behind them, Eunice is there too, her eyes are red and her perfect blonde hair is disheveled, her plastic face with cuts and she has a cut on her lips. She comes to stand next to the Alpha and whispers something in his ears and after a long thought, he nods his acceptance.

""Lock her up, whip her every day until I say no more,"" Her voice is smooth as she orders but my eyes are fixed on my mate, a sting on my cheek brings me back to the present and I touch my cheeks. Suddenly, tears fall and I don't have the chance to wipe them. Strong, huge hands grab my arms and drag me a few feet away from the two couples. Once in the dark dungeon, I'm thrown to the ground like a sack of potatoes and they exit the room, then, I feel it, my chest begins to constrict and a fire within me begins to burn terribly. I let out a sob and, for the first time in forever, I cried. I cry for the horrible life I've lived since I was thirteen years old, I cry for my parents, their abandonment, their dislike and, lastly, I cry for Amos, my mate. I thought when I found my mate, he would love and protect me as a mate should, but today, he's taken away all my will to fight, my wolf withdraws to the dark part of my mind and I howl, feeling more alone than ever.

Days passed by fast and every day, the guards came to wipe me with very painful lashes, my back had cuts and tears of flesh on it. I bet I looked bad. I am only allowed one meal a day; bread and water. I haven't felt Chalo since our mate rejected us.

She is depressed and sad just like me. I get up from the cold floor and clutch my chest as I say the words.

""I, Anaiah Ross, accept your rejection, Amos Rivers,"" I don't feel the bond breaking on my side however, Amos will feel the bond tear between us and will experience pain like no other.

**Chapter 3 She Has Accepted Our Rejection**

Amos's POV

I was welcoming our guests for the renewal treaty celebration when something kept tugging on my heart. Something was wrong, my wolf Narcisse was giving me a hard time, growling and snarling at me. There are times he acts sick, he dislikes me and I rejected our mate, but I can't accept her as my mate, especially my Luna. She ended my uncle.

'In self-defense!' Narcisse growls.

'No one believes her,' I retort. My uncle was a bad person, but he was still my family. She could have dealt with the situation better than ending him in coldness.

'She was thirteen years old! She had no control over her wolf, Amos, I can tell that her wolf is strong,' he says the last part proudly. Indeed, my uncle had Alpha power and was one of the strongest wolves, but she still bested him.

Anaiah Ross is not only the most beautiful girl in the pack, but even behind her miry clothes, she can make any man bow to his knees. She is strong as well. She has endured so many hardships since she was a little girl.

'She can make a fine Luna,' Breathes Narcisse.

'Yes, not ours, we shall make Eunice our Luna as my parents want. Her parents are strong and have been our allies for years,'

Eunice is an entitled crying baby, but I have to be with her to strengthen my pack and she's a good, but mostly when I do her or any other wolf, I picture Anaiah, her baby blue eyes, her long hair. Her  lips and beautiful face are enough to make me like a teenager for the first time.

She's the epitome of beauty. I excuse myself and go to my office. I call an Omega who is more than happy.

""Oh my Alpha, you are amazing, as usual,"" she purrs. I go to my desk and sit on my chair,  relaxing when I suddenly feel a sharp pain in my chest. I groan and growl, and the Omega comes to me worried, but I bear my sharp canines at her and she staggers, falling on her side in fear.

""Get out,"" I growl as the pain only intensifies.

'WHAT IS GOING ON?' I ask Narcisse. He's also in so much pain.

'Our mate has accepted our rejection,'

'NO!' I roar.",1,1753467649.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

I’ve been desperate to try these new fragrances and had to blind buy from eBay just so I could try them! 

They turned up today and…. *phew* - I LOVE them all! Vanilla Romance is one of my favourite vanilla scents, so was eager to see how Ease and Cafe would hold up. 

Cafe is definitely my favourite; although I wish the coffee scent came through stronger - but I have someone sourcing me the Rich Espresso cream and perfume so I’m hoping to layer these together but yes - I love it it! This is going to be my staple once autumn officially hits. 

Ease is pretty nice too; it’s clean, and not too overpower with the lavender. It’s definitely something I can see myself spraying before bed time for that little bit of night time comfort. 

I scream Float is… well, not what I was expecting from the scent notes. It’s a lot more sherbet-y and more fruitier than I was expecting. Not my favourite Halloween scent but I will definitely use it. 

Now Milk… this was the one I was scared about. I’ve seen lots of mixed opinions - but I love the Milky Bath fragrance from LUSH so was hopeful I would love this…

And I do. I really do! On my goodness, it’s so creamy, just the right amount of sweetness and layered with vanilla cafe; oh I’m just a sweet caramel latte… 

So I now have someone sourcing me the matching lotions for all 4 of the scents; plus I’ve also got Sweet Cinnamon Pumpkin and Glazed Pumpkin on the way too. Oh I can’t wait. 😅

I said ro myself it's fishy, but ok. I cooperated with the support team sending even a photo of my government issued ID and screenshots of my work and the whole process it was made. They did not accept and I said then delete the book from the platform, the support told me that they can only block the title and I agreed and asked if it would cause any fhrther problems and they said no, that it will be ok. I said to myself that it was an odd situation and maybe I missed something and they know better since I was a beginner back then. A month later, my second book was finished (a romance novel as the first one), I uploaded the book and it was a success, it remained up and ready to be discovered. Made a website, added the KDP link to my books (I was planning to upload more, I was pretty confident that this is just the beginning of something beautiful)   promoted the second book on social media, everything was going great until monday when I received the disturbing email which stated ,,misleading metadata"" and from here it begins the true horror story. Immediatly I responded and provided evidence of originality, proof of website ownership and even screenshots from the previous cases but I kept receiving the same answer that the decision is final and I will not be able to make an account ever again. I sent another email stating again the facts as they were, sent the same proofs again, received the same email stating that account closure is final. Now, I sent them again an email asking for a reevaluation by a real human and not a bot, and let's see if they will answer. I have other works of mine published on other platforms as well, and never had any issues with anything I uploaded until I decided to upload to Amazon as well. So, how come other books on other platforms, written by me word by word, had no issues and when I put another book on Amazon suddenly nothing is good about it? I have to mention that I started my writing carreer when I was in the university, writing each morning a page or two while drinking coffee and the ideas piled up and got outlines as well. But only two years ago I started to publish for real. At this point I am not even know what will happen next, but I made up my mind and I will not be uploading any other books on KDP even if Jeff himself comes to my door to beg me to upload a book on their platform. I will keep publishing on the other platforms and build my carrer as an author outside their platform. 
I just wanted to share this story for other authors to be warned that even if you are correct as myself and do everything as they said, your account is in danger. So, be carefull out there and be aware of what are signing up for. KDP is a jungle and there are rules that can change over night.

My original post:  
  
""Already seen a couple of posts on Ryan and Haleys unhealthy diet, but wanted to expand on this - their breakfast every day basically consists of cheesy and bacon McGriddles and loads of sugary iced coffees (vanilla and cookie dough), they drink soda pop instead of water all day, lunch is usually either pizza, burger, fries or hotdog (bought or frozen) and dinner consists of joyride, popcorn, potato chips, candy, ordered or canned foods in variation.   
  
***To me, this contradicts the mission statement of joyride, when Ryan as the frontfacing figure eats insanely processed, unhealthy junkfood all day every day. It seems disingenuous and makes kind of a joke out of the conviction behind the candy, which is why I'm so confused they are broadcasting it like this.***  
  
People have argued Ryan and Haley are still young and work out, but that doesn't change that there are still close to no nutrients in what they consume, they still need to be fueled with *something*, Apart from the argument how millions of kids are watching this and hopefully don't get inspired by it. I understand healthy options are harder to come by on a roadtrip, but it's still up to you if you broadcast your junkfood consumption as excessively, as Ryan did.  
  
***Their diet also has a significant impact on their focus, attention, sleep and energy, things you'd think are crucial for a series that mainly takes place on the road, regarding safety and sustainability.***

My second criticism would be the constant Mr.Beast glazing, that later turned into roasting. It's like Ryan knows Beast sits on a ton of money and wants him to get to donate more by glazing him, and given he hasn't reacted ever since, then turned to roasting to maybe ""challenge"" it out of him - just to still be met with silence. I think it just paints perfectly who Beast is:   
  
***He wanted to be the first one to donate to the series, because it benefited his first-at-everything image, look at me, the high baller! But since then ghosted it (no matter how hard Ryan pushed Feastables or mentions Beast in every second video) because he didn't care to begin with.***   
  
It's just increasingly hard to watch Ryan fight for a narcissists attention in all ways he can think of, although that dude already got what he wanted.""",6,1753467312.0,mrbeastsnark,1,1.0,False

### 1. Parse the Odds: Why Arizona’s Pitching Looks Like a Fort Knox Vault

The Arizona Diamondbacks (-132) are favored to win this matchup, and the math backs it up. With Ryne Nelson on the mound—8 of his last 11 starts have allowed **one or fewer runs**—the Diamondbacks’ pitching staff is as reliable as a Swiss watch. Nelson’s ERA this season? Let’s just say it’s not the kind of number you want to see on a speeding ticket. Meanwhile, the Pirates’ offense is so anemic they’d struggle to score against a **team of kindergarten dodgeball players**. Pittsburgh averages just **3.4 runs per game**, last in MLB, and their home-run total (or lack thereof) could power a wind turbine.

The totals line sits at **8.5/9.0 runs**, with the under priced attractively. Arizona’s pitchers (hello, 2.63 ERA from Merrill Kelly in July) and the Pirates’ feeble bats make this a **screaming under bet**. Imagine a game where the combined score is lower than the number of errors both teams committed last week. It’s not a stretch.

### 2. Digest the News: Pirates’ “Sweep” of the Tigers Was a Fluke (Probably)

Yes, the Pirates just swept the Tigers—a team that’s basically the Cleveland Browns of baseball. But let’s not confuse a **sudden burst of luck** with a blueprint for success. Detroit’s pitching staff is so bad, they’d probably lose to a team of retirees with a slide rule. The Diamondbacks? They’ve won 50% of games when favored this season, and their offense slugs at a **.446 clip**, second in MLB. Players like Eugenio Suárez and Josh Naylor are hitting like they’re in a video game on “God Mode,” while Geraldo Perdomo’s defense is so smooth, it makes a greased-up otter look clumsy.

On the flip side, Pittsburgh’s “stars” are… well, let’s just say they’re not. Oneil Cruz’s power is fun
