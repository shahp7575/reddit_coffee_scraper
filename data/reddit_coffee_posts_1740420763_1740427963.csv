I was able to tour some great homes in terms of design, layout, furnishings, and of course, the Mid-century vibe. I toured 14 homes. I met some wonderful, gracious owners and very helpful docents. Overall, I enjoyed it but then, I like architecture and well-done Mid-century interior design.

Of the 14 homes, 9 were owned by a gay man, a gay couple, or a gay throuple, or combination of a gay couple and their good friend who is an interior designer. üôÇ I have to tell you, I was claustrophobic in just about all the homes owned by gay men! *EVERY* surface was covered with stuff! Paintings (including many abstracts with very loud colors) on every inch of wall space and then, paintings propped up because there was no place to hang them. Knickknacks, tchotchkes, elegant glass, bowls, vases, books, throws, ornate mirrors, exquisitely designed coffee and end tables, etc., etc. In one home, I was so overwhelmed by the colors and the clutter (and the low ceilings) that I had to get out there!üôÉ My favorite room in any house is the bathroom. A few bathrooms I saw were so over-the-top, I couldn't imagine using them on a daily basis - the tiles were loud and garish.

The remaining 4 homes were owned by a single woman, and 3 hetero couples. Simple (and expensive) interiors and cleaner lines but way less stuff packed into those spaces.

Even my few gay friends here in San Francisco have these homes packed with stuff! I don't get it. Is that a gay thing? A lot of ""stuff?""",1,1740427840.0,palmsprings,1,1.0,False

Danny is too eager to start over after the death of her girlfriend, Astrid, despite being haunted by her literal silent ghost. All Danny wants is to find a job, move out from her brother‚Äôs house, and keep Astrid‚Äôs ghost from ruining her new future. But a chance encounter at a coffee shop where the living can speak with the dead reveals that Danny‚Äôs grief is keeping Astrid‚Äôs spirit from moving on.

The alluring coffee shop owner, Nora, offers Danny a way forward in her life by working through the memories that keep Astrid‚Äôs spirit trapped. Danny is reluctant to participate, believing she has grieved enough. But after Astrid nearly kills Danny in a house fire, she accepts Nora‚Äôs help to break the spiritual tethers that keep her former girlfriend bound to her.

With no home to return to, Danny pursues a job as Nora‚Äôs apprentice, helping other patrons communicate with their tethered spirits. But grief can be strange. Soon, a romance blossoms with Nora, who is fighting her own battle with starting over. But before they can see what the future holds for them together, Danny wishes to free Astrid. And the longer Astrid is tethered to Danny, the more violent and inhuman Astrid risks becoming.

In an effort to free Astrid, Danny participates in strange coffee rituals, reliving memories of chemo treatments and hateful attacks from Astrid‚Äôs religious family, all while avoiding the inevitable memory of Astrid‚Äôs death. She must come to terms with her alleged part in Astrid‚Äôs final moments. But guilt and grief may prove too powerful to overcome, even with the potential for a future with Nora and the fresh start she so badly believes she needs.

For context, I am not a physicist but an armchair physics enthusiast. As such, I can only present a conceptual argument as I don‚Äôt have the training to express or test my ideas through formal mathematics. My purpose in posting is to get some feedback from physicists or mathematicians who DO have that formal training so that I can better understand these concepts. I am extremely interested in the nature of reality, but my only relevant skills are that I am a decent thinker and writer. I have done my best to put my ideas into a coherent format, but I apologize if it falls below the scientific standard.

¬†

\-

¬†

Classical physics describes gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass. However, this perspective treats mass and spacetime as separate entities, with mass mysteriously ‚Äúcausing‚Äù spacetime to warp. My hypothesis is to reverse the standard view: **instead of mass curving spacetime**, I propose that **curved spacetime is what creates mass**, and that **gravity is the felt topological contraction of that process.** This would mean that gravity is not a reaction to mass but rather the very process by which mass comes into existence.

For this hypothesis to be feasible, at least two premises must hold:

1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Our universe can be described, in principle, as the activity of a single unified field

2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Mass can be described as emerging from the topological contraction of that field

¬†

**Preface**

The search for a unified field theory ‚Äì a single fundamental field that gives rise to all known physical forces and phenomena ‚Äì is still an open question in physics. Therefore, **my goal for premise 1 will not be to establish its factuality but its plausibility**. If it can be demonstrated that it is possible, in principle, for all of reality to be the behavior of a single field, I offer this as one compelling reason to take the prospect seriously. Another compelling reason is that we have already identified the electric, magnetic, and weak nuclear fields as being different modes of a single field. This progression suggests that what we currently identify as separate quantum fields might be different behavioral paradigms of one unified field.

As for the identity of the fundamental field that produces all others, I submit that **spacetime is the most natural candidate.** Conventionally, spacetime is already treated as the background framework in which all quantum fields operate. Every known field ‚Äì electroweak, strong, Higgs, etc. ‚Äì exists within spacetime, making it the fundamental substratum that underlies all known physics. Furthermore, if my hypothesis is correct, and mass and gravity emerge as contractions of a unified field, then it follows that this field must be spacetime itself, as it is the field being deformed in the presence of mass. Therefore, I will be referring to our prospective unified field as ‚Äúspacetime‚Äù through the remainder of this post.

¬†

**Premise 1: Our universe can be described, in principle, as the activity of a single unified field**

My challenge for this premise will be to demonstrate how a single field could produce the entire physical universe, both the very small domain of the quantum and the very big domain of the relativistic. I will do this by way of two different but complementary principles.

¬†

*Premise 1, Principle 1:* ***Given infinite time, vibration gives rise to recursive structure***

Consider the sound a single guitar string makes when it is plucked. At first it may sound as if it makes a single, pure note. But if we were to ‚Äúzoom in‚Äù in on that note, we would discover that it was actually composed of a combination of multiple harmonic subtones overlapping one another. If we could enhance our hearing arbitrarily, we would hear not only a third, a fifth, and an octave, but also thirds within the third, fifths within the fifth, octaves over the octave, regressing in a **recursive hierarchy of harmonics** composing that single sound.

But why is that? The musical space between each harmonic interval is entirely disharmonic, and should represent the vast majority of all possible sound. So why isn‚Äôt the guitar string‚Äôs sound composed of disharmonic microtones? ¬†All things being equal, that should be the more likely outcome. The reason has to do with the nature of vibration itself. Only certain frequencies (harmonics) can form stable patterns due to wave interference, and these frequencies correspond to **whole-number standing wave patterns.** Only integer multiples of the fundamental vibration are possible, because anything ‚Äúbetween‚Äù these modes ‚Äì say, at 1.5 times the fundamental frequency ‚Äì destructively interfere with themselves, **erasing their own waves.** As a result, random vibration over time naturally organizes itself into a nested hierarchy of structure.

Now, quantum fields follow the same rule. ¬†Quantum fields are wave-like systems that have constraints that enforce discrete excitations. The fields have natural resonance modes dictated by wave mechanics, and these modes must be whole-number multiples because otherwise, they would destructively interfere. A particle cannot exist as ‚Äúhalf an excitation‚Äù for the same reason you can‚Äôt pluck half a stable wave on a guitar string. As a result, the randomly exciting quantum field of virtual particles (quantum foam) inevitably gives rise to a nested hierarchy of structure.

Therefore,

If QFT demonstrates the components of the standard model are all products of this phenomenon, then spacetime would only need to ‚Äúbegin‚Äù with the fundamental quality of being vibratory to, in principle, generate all the known building blocks of reality. If particles can be described as excitations in fields, and at least three of the known fields (electric, magnetic, and weak nuclear) can be described as modes of one field, it seems possible that **all** quantum fields may ultimately be modes of a single field. **The quantum fields themselves could be thought of as the first ‚Äúnested‚Äù structures that a vibrating spacetime gives rise to, appearing as discrete paradigms of behavior, just as the subsequent particles they give rise to appear at discrete levels of energy.** By analogy, if spacetime is a vibrating guitar string, the quantum fields would be its primary harmonic composition, and the quantum particles would be its nested harmonic subtones ‚Äì the thirds and fifths and octaves within the third, fifth, and octave.

An important implication of this possibility is that, in this model, everything in reality could ultimately be described as the ‚Äúexcitation‚Äù of spacetime. If spacetime is a fabric, then all emergent phenomena (mass, energy, particles, macrocosmic entities, etc.) could be described as topological distortions of that fabric.

¬†

*Premise 1, Principle 2:* ***Linearity vs nonlinearity ‚Äì the ‚Äúreality‚Äù of things are a function of the condensation of energy in a field***

There are two intriguing concepts in mathematics: **linearity and nonlinearity.** In short, a linear system occurs at low enough energy levels that it can be **superimposed** on top of other systems, with little to no interaction between them. On the other hand, nonlinear systems interact and displace one another such they cannot be superimposed. In simplistic terms, linear phenomenon are insubstantial while nonlinear phenomenon are material. While this sounds abstract, we encounter these systems in the real world all the time. For example:

If you went out on the ocean in a boat, set anchor, and sat bobbing in one spot, you would only experience one type of wave at a time. Large waves would replace medium waves would replace small waves because the ocean‚Äôs surface (at one point) can only have one frequency and amplitude at a time. If two ocean waves meet they don‚Äôt share the space ‚Äì they interact to form a new kind of wave. In other words, **these waves are nonlinear.**

In contrast, consider electromagnetic waves. Although they are waves they are different from the oceanic variety in at least one respect: As you stand in your room you can see visible light all around you. If you turn on the radio, it picks up radio waves. If you had the appropriate sensors you would also infrared waves as body heat, ultraviolet waves from the sun, x-rays and gamma rays as cosmic radiation, all filling the same space in your room. But how can this be? How can a single substratum (the EM field) simultaneously oscillate at ten different amplitudes and frequencies without each type of radiation displacing the others? The answer is **linearity.**

EM radiation is a linear phenomenon, and as such it can be superimposed on top of itself with little to no interaction between types of radiation. If the EM field is a vibrating surface, it can vibrate in every possible way it *can* vibrate, all at once, with little to no interaction between them. This can be difficult to visualize, but imagine the EM field like an infinite plane of dots. Each type of radiation is like an oceanic wave on the plane‚Äôs surface, and because there is so much empty space between each dot the different kinds of radiation can inhabit the same space, passing through one another without interacting. The space between dots represents the low amount of energy in the system. Because EM radiation has relatively low energy and relatively low structure, it can be superimposed upon itself.

Nonlinear phenomena, on the other hand, is far easier to understand. Anything with sufficient density and structure becomes a nonlinear system: your body, objects in the room, waves in the ocean, cars, trees, bugs, lampposts, etc. Mathematically, the property of mass necessarily bestows a certain degree of nonlinearity, which is why your hand has to move the coffee mug out of the way to fill the same space, or a field mouse has to push leaves out of the way. **Nonlinearity is a function of density and structure.** In other words, **it is a function of mass.** And because E=MC\^2, it is ultimately a function of the condensation of energy.

Therefore,

Because nonlinearity is a function of mass, and mass is the condensation of energy in a field, **the same field can produce both linear and nonlinear phenomena.** In other words, activity in a unified field which is at first insubstantial, superimposable, diffuse and probabilistic in nature, can *become* ¬†the structured, tangible, macrocosmic domain of physical reality simply by condensing more energy into the system. **The microcosmic quantum could** ***become*** **the macrocosmic relativistic when it reaches a certain threshold of energy that we call mass, all within the context of a single field‚Äôs vibrations evolving into a nested hierarchy of structure.**

¬†

**Premise 2: Mass can be described as emerging from the topological contraction of that field**

This premise follows from the groundwork laid in the first. If the universe can be described as the activity of spacetime, then the next step is to explain how mass arises within that field. Traditionally, mass is treated as an inherent property of certain particles, granted through mechanisms such as the Higgs field. However, I propose that **mass is not an independent property but rather a localized, topological contraction of spacetime itself.**

In the context of a field-based universe, a topological contraction refers to a process by which a portion of the field densifies, self-stabilizing into a persistent structure. In other words, what we call ‚Äúmass‚Äù could be the result of the field folding or condensing into a self-sustaining curvature. This is not an entirely foreign idea. In general relativity, mass bends spacetime, creating gravitational curvature. But if we invert this perspective, it suggests that what we perceive as mass is simply the localized expression of that curvature. **Rather than mass warping spacetime, it is the act of spacetime curving in on itself that** ***manifests*** **as mass.**

If mass is a topological contraction, then gravity is the tension of the field pulling against that contraction. This reframing removes the need for mass to be treated as a separate, fundamental entity and instead describes it as an emergent property of spacetime‚Äôs dynamics.

This follows from Premise 1 in the following way:

¬†

*Premise 2, Principle 1:* ***Mass is the threshold at which a field‚Äôs linear vibration becomes nonlinear***

Building on the distinction between linear and nonlinear phenomena from Premise 1, mass can be understood as the **threshold** at which a previously linear (superimposable) vibration becomes nonlinear. As energy density in the field increases, certain excitations self-reinforce and stabilize into discrete, non-interactable entities. This transition from linear to nonlinear behavior marks the birth of mass.

This perspective aligns well with existing physics. Consider QFT: particles are modeled as excitations in their respective fields, but these excitations follow strict quantization rules, preventing them from existing in fractional or intermediate states (as discussed in Premise 1, Principle 1). The reason for this could be that stable mass requires a complete topological contraction, meaning partial contractions self-annihilate before becoming observable. Moreover, energy concentration in spacetime behaves in a way that suggests a critical threshold effect. Low-energy fluctuations in a field remain ephemeral (as virtual particles), but at high enough energy densities, they transition into persistent, observable mass. This suggests **a direct correlation between mass and field curvature** ‚Äì mass arises not as a separate entity but as the *natural consequence* of a sufficient accumulation of energy forcing a localized contraction in spacetime.

Therefore,

Vibration is a topological distortion in a field, and it has a threshold at which linearity becomes nonlinearity, and this is what we call mass. **Mass can thus be understood as a contraction of spacetime;** a condensation within a condensate; the collapse of a plenum upon itself resulting in the formation of a tangible ‚Äúknot‚Äù of spacetime.

¬†

**Conclusion**

To sum up my hypothesis so far I have argued that it is, in principle, possible that:

1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Spacetime alone exists fundamentally, but with a vibratory quality.

2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Random vibrations over infinite time in the fundamental medium inevitably generate a nested hierarchy of structure ‚Äì what we detect as quantum fields and particles

3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† As quantum fields and particles interact in the ways observed by QFT, mass emerges as a form of high-energy, nonlinear vibration, representing the topological transformation of spacetime into ‚Äúphysical‚Äù reality

Now, if mass is a contracted region of the unified field, then gravity becomes a much more intuitive phenomenon. Gravity would simply be the felt tension of spacetime‚Äôs topological distortion as it generates mass, analogous to how a knot tied in stretched fabric would be surrounded by a radius of tightened cloth that ‚Äúpulls toward‚Äù the knot. **This would mean that gravity is not an external force, but the very process by which mass comes into being.** The attraction we feel as gravity would be a residual effect of spacetime condensing its internal space upon a point, generating the spherical ‚Äústretched‚Äù topologies we know as geodesics.

This model naturally explains why all mass experiences gravity. In conventional physics, it is an open question why gravity affects all forms of energy and matter. If mass and gravity are two aspects of the same contraction process, then gravity is a fundamental property of mass itself. This also helps to reconcile the apparent disparity between gravity and quantum mechanics. Current models struggle to reconcile the smooth curvature of general relativity with the discrete quantization of QFT. However, if mass arises from field contractions, then gravity is not a separate phenomenon that must be quantized ‚Äì it is already built into the structure of mass formation itself.

**And thus, my hypothesis:** ***Gravity is the felt topological contraction of spacetime into mass***

This hypothesis reframes mass not as a fundamental particle property but as an emergent phenomenon of spacetime self-modulation. If mass is simply a localized contraction of a unified field, and gravity is the field‚Äôs response to that contraction, then the long-sought bridge between quantum mechanics and general relativity may lie not in quantizing gravity, but in recognizing that mass *is* gravity at its most fundamental level.

¬†

I am not a scientist, but I understand science well enough to know that if this hypothesis is true, then it should explain existing phenomena more naturally and make testable predictions. I‚Äôll finish by including my thoughts on this, as well as where the hypothesis falls short and could be improved.

¬†

Existing phenomena explained more naturally

1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Why does all mass generate gravity?

In current physics, mass is treated as an intrinsic property of matter, and gravity is treated as a separate force acting on mass. Yet all mass, no matter the amount, generates gravity. Why? This model suggests that gravity is not *caused* by mass ‚Äì it *is* mass, in the sense that mass is a local contraction of the field. Any amount of contraction (any mass) necessarily comes with a gravitational effect.

2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Why does gravity affect all forms of mass and energy equally?

In the standard model, the equivalence of inertial and gravitational mass is one of the fundamental mysteries of physics. This model suggests that if mass is a contraction of spacetime itself, then what we call ‚Äúgravitational attraction‚Äù may actually be the tendency of the field to balance itself around any contraction. This makes it natural that all mass-energy would follow the same geodesics.

3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Why can‚Äôt we find the graviton?

Quantum gravity theories predict a hypothetical force-carrying particle (the graviton), but no experiment has ever detected it. This model suggests that if gravity is not a force between masses but rather the felt effect of topological contraction, then there is no need for a graviton to mediate gravitational interactions.

¬†

Predictions to test the hypothesis

1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Microscopic field knots as the basis of mass

If mass is a local contraction of the field, then at very small scales we might find evidence of this in the form of stable, topologically-bound regions of spacetime, akin to microscopic ‚Äúknots‚Äù in the field structure. Experiments could look for deviations in how mass forms at small scales, or correlations between vacuum fluctuations and weak gravitational curvatures

2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† A fundamental energy threshold between linear and nonlinear realities

This model implies that reality shifts from quantum-like (linear, superimposable) to classical-like (nonlinear, interactive) at a fundamental energy density. If gravity and mass emerge from field contractions, then there should be a preferred frequency or resonance that represents that threshold.

3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Black hole singularities

General relativity predicts that mass inside a black hole collapses to a singularity of infinite density, which is mathematically problematic (or so I‚Äôm led to believe). But if mass is a contraction of spacetime, then black holes may not contain a true singularity but instead reach a finite maximum contraction, possibly leading to an ultra-dense but non-divergent state. Could this be tested mathematically?

4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† A potential explanation for dark matter

We currently detect the gravitational influence of dark matter, but its source remains unknown. If spacetime contractions create gravity, then not all gravitational effects need to correspond to observable particles, per se. Some regions of space could be contracted without containing traditional mass, mimicking the effects of dark matter.

¬†

Obvious flaws and areas for further refinement in this hypothesis

1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Lack of a mathematical framework

2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This hypothesis suggests that mass is a contraction of spacetime, but does not specify what *causes* the field to contract in the first place.

3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† There is currently no direct observational or experimental evidence that spacetime contracts in a way that could be interpreted as mass formation (that I am aware of)

4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† If mass is a contraction of spacetime, how does this reconcile with the wave-particle duality and probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics?

5.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† If gravity is not a force but the felt effect of spacetime contraction, then why does it behave in ways that resemble a traditional force?

6.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† If mass is a spacetime contraction, how does it interact with energy conservation laws? Does this contraction involve a hidden cost?

7.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Why is gravity so much weaker than the other fundamental forces? Why would spacetime contraction result in such a discrepancy in strength?

He lay there for a moment, blinking slowly, taking in the quiet around him. Valyria was still asleep, her back turned to him, tangled in the sheets. Her hair spread out across the pillow like a dark halo, and he couldn‚Äôt help but watch her for a moment, appreciating the stillness, the rare peace between them.

It wasn‚Äôt often that mornings were like this. Their lives were busy, constantly in motion, but these moments‚Äîmoments where they could just breathe, where the world outside their little bubble could wait‚Äîwere treasures.

Carefully, so as not to disturb her, Caius reached over and brushed a strand of hair from her face. His fingers grazed her skin, warm and soft, and for a fleeting second, he felt this overwhelming urge to hold onto the simplicity of the moment. No words, no demands, just them.

But he didn‚Äôt know how to be still. Even now, as he lay next to her, the urge to check his phone, to think about the meetings he‚Äôd have later, the things he needed to do, was constant. He couldn‚Äôt help it. It was how he‚Äôd always been.

Still, he pushed those thoughts away and rolled out of bed, moving quietly so as not to wake her. He needed coffee, needed the familiar routine of starting his day. The house was still quiet, a silence broken only by the soft hum of the fridge and the ticking of the clock.

The kitchen was a familiar space‚Äîcold marble counters, polished chrome appliances, the morning light spilling over everything. He moved through it effortlessly, setting the coffee to brew as he prepared breakfast. Eggs, toast, nothing special. But the simple act of making something for her‚Äîsomething she didn‚Äôt have to do herself‚Äîfelt meaningful.

He had never been the kind of guy who expressed emotions in ways others might expect. There were no grand gestures or long, emotional speeches. With Valyria, it was always simpler. There was something between them that didn‚Äôt require words‚Äîan understanding, a quiet connection that didn‚Äôt need to be explained.

He glanced over at the table, then back at the clock. She‚Äôd be waking up soon, probably already stretching, rubbing her eyes. She had a way of pulling him into her orbit, making everything else fade into the background.

Just as the coffee was ready, he heard the soft sound of footsteps behind him. He didn‚Äôt turn immediately but felt her presence.

‚ÄúMorning,‚Äù she said softly, her voice still thick with sleep, and he smiled without thinking.

‚ÄúMorning.‚Äù His voice was quieter, rougher in the early hours, but it was hers.

Valyria moved toward him, her steps slower than usual, still clearly in the haze of sleep. She reached for the coffee he had set out for her, her fingers brushing against his as she took the cup from his hand. There was no need to ask if it was just how she liked it‚Äîstrong, black, no sugar. They knew these things without having to speak.

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt have to do all this,‚Äù she murmured, her eyes still half-lidded as she took a sip of the coffee.

‚ÄúI wanted to,‚Äù Caius replied, his gaze soft as he looked at her. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre always doing everything.‚Äù

She smiled then, a small, genuine thing that made his chest tighten. She didn‚Äôt say anything, but her look spoke volumes. It was a shared understanding between them‚Äîshe always handled so much, always carrying more than anyone else could see.

He didn‚Äôt understand it fully, but he didn‚Äôt need to. With her, he didn‚Äôt have to understand everything to appreciate it. He simply watched her, enjoying the way her presence seemed to fill the room, the way she made everything feel grounded.

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù she said quietly, her fingers reaching out to trace his hand.

Caius let out a breath he hadn‚Äôt realized he was holding, allowing her touch to soothe the tension he hadn‚Äôt even been aware of. The world outside, the demands of his work, his constant drive‚Äîthey all felt miles away in that moment. It was just the two of them, and that was enough.

For a fleeting moment, he thought about the future, about how things might change, how nothing ever really stayed still. But then Valyria leaned into him, her head resting on his shoulder as they sat together at the table, and he allowed himself to forget about tomorrow.

Classical physics describes gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass. However, this perspective treats mass and spacetime as separate entities, with mass mysteriously ‚Äúcausing‚Äù spacetime to warp. My hypothesis is to reverse the standard view: **instead of mass curving spacetime**, I propose that **curved spacetime is what creates mass**, and that **gravity is the felt topological contraction of that process.** This would mean that gravity is not a reaction to mass but rather the very process by which mass comes into existence.

For this hypothesis to be feasible, it seems that at least two premises must hold:

1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Our universe can be described, in principle, as the activity of a single unified field

2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Mass can be described as emerging from the topological contraction of that field

¬†

**Preface**

The search for a unified field theory ‚Äì a single fundamental field that gives rise to all known physical forces and phenomena ‚Äì is still an open question in physics. Therefore, **my goal for premise 1 will not be to establish its factuality but its plausibility**. If it can be demonstrated that it is possible, in principle, for all of reality to be the behavior of a single field, I offer this as one compelling reason to take the prospect seriously. Another compelling reason is that we have already identified the electric, magnetic, and weak nuclear fields as being different modes of a single field. This progression suggests that what we currently identify as separate quantum fields might be different behavioral paradigms of one unified field.

As for the identity of the fundamental field that produces all others, I submit that **spacetime is the most natural candidate.** Conventionally, spacetime is already treated as the background framework in which all quantum fields operate. Every known field ‚Äì electroweak, strong, Higgs, etc. ‚Äì exists within spacetime, making it the fundamental substratum that underlies all known physics. Furthermore, if my hypothesis is correct, and mass and gravity emerge as contractions of a unified field, then it follows that this field must be spacetime itself, as it is the field being deformed in the presence of mass. Therefore, I will be referring to our prospective unified field as ‚Äúspacetime‚Äù through the remainder of this post.

¬†

**Premise 1: Our universe can be described, in principle, as the activity of a single unified field**

My challenge for this premise will be to demonstrate how a single field could produce the entire physical universe, both the very small domain of the quantum and the very big domain of the relativistic. I will do this by way of two different but complementary principles.

¬†

*Premise 1, Principle 1:* ***Given infinite time, vibration gives rise to recursive structure***

Consider the sound a single guitar string makes when it is plucked. At first it may sound as if it makes a single, pure note. But if we were to ‚Äúzoom in‚Äù in on that note, we would discover that it was actually composed of a combination of multiple harmonic subtones overlapping one another. If we could enhance our hearing arbitrarily, we would hear not only a third, a fifth, and an octave, but also thirds within the third, fifths within the fifth, octaves over the octave, regressing in a **recursive hierarchy of harmonics** composing that single sound.

But why is that? The musical space between each harmonic interval is entirely disharmonic, and should represent the vast majority of all possible sound. So why isn‚Äôt the guitar string‚Äôs sound composed of disharmonic microtones? ¬†All things being equal, that should be the more likely outcome. The reason has to do with the nature of vibration itself. Only certain frequencies (harmonics) can form stable patterns due to wave interference, and these frequencies correspond to **whole-number standing wave patterns.** Only integer multiples of the fundamental vibration are possible, because anything ‚Äúbetween‚Äù these modes ‚Äì say, at 1.5 times the fundamental frequency ‚Äì destructively interfere with themselves, **erasing their own waves.** As a result, random vibration over time naturally organizes itself into a nested hierarchy of structure.

Now, quantum fields follow the same rule. ¬†Quantum fields are wave-like systems that have constraints that enforce discrete excitations. The fields have natural resonance modes dictated by wave mechanics, and these modes must be whole-number multiples because otherwise, they would destructively interfere. A particle cannot exist as ‚Äúhalf an excitation‚Äù for the same reason you can‚Äôt pluck half a stable wave on a guitar string. As a result, the randomly exciting quantum field of virtual particles (quantum foam) inevitably gives rise to a nested hierarchy of structure.

Therefore,

If QFT demonstrates the components of the standard model are all products of this phenomenon, then spacetime would only need to ‚Äúbegin‚Äù with the fundamental quality of being vibratory to, in principle, generate all the known building blocks of reality. If particles can be described as excitations in fields, and at least three of the known fields (electric, magnetic, and weak nuclear) can be described as modes of one field, it seems possible that **all** quantum fields may ultimately be modes of a single field. **The quantum fields themselves could be thought of as the first ‚Äúnested‚Äù structures that a vibrating spacetime gives rise to, appearing as discrete paradigms of behavior, just as the subsequent particles they give rise to appear at discrete levels of energy.** By analogy, if spacetime is a vibrating guitar string, the quantum fields would be its primary harmonic composition, and the quantum particles would be its nested harmonic subtones ‚Äì the thirds and fifths and octaves within the third, fifth, and octave.

An important implication of this possibility is that, in this model, everything in reality could ultimately be described as the ‚Äúexcitation‚Äù of spacetime. If spacetime is a fabric, then all emergent phenomena (mass, energy, particles, macrocosmic entities, etc.) could be described as topological distortions of that fabric.

¬†

¬†

*Premise 1, Principle 2:* ***Linearity vs nonlinearity ‚Äì the ‚Äúreality‚Äù of things are a function of the condensation of energy in a field***

There are two intriguing concepts in mathematics: **linearity and nonlinearity.** In short, a linear system occurs at low enough energy levels that it can be **superimposed** on top of other systems, with little to no interaction between them. On the other hand, nonlinear systems interact and displace one another such they cannot be superimposed. In simplistic terms, linear phenomenon are insubstantial while nonlinear phenomenon are material. While this sounds abstract, we encounter these systems in the real world all the time. For example:

If you went out on the ocean in a boat, set anchor, and sat bobbing in one spot, you would only experience one type of wave at a time. Large waves would replace medium waves would replace small waves because the ocean‚Äôs surface (at one point) can only have one frequency and amplitude at a time. If two ocean waves meet they don‚Äôt share the space ‚Äì they interact to form a new kind of wave. In other words, **these waves are nonlinear.**

In contrast, consider electromagnetic waves. Although they are waves they are different from the oceanic variety in at least one respect: As you stand in your room you can see visible light all around you. If you turn on the radio, it picks up radio waves. If you had the appropriate sensors you would also infrared waves as body heat, ultraviolet waves from the sun, x-rays and gamma rays as cosmic radiation, all filling the same space in your room. But how can this be? How can a single substratum (the EM field) simultaneously oscillate at ten different amplitudes and frequencies without each type of radiation displacing the others? The answer is **linearity.**

EM radiation is a linear phenomenon, and as such it can be superimposed on top of itself with little to no interaction between types of radiation. If the EM field is a vibrating surface, it can vibrate in every possible way it *can* vibrate, all at once, with little to no interaction between them. This can be difficult to visualize, but imagine the EM field like an infinite plane of dots. Each type of radiation is like an oceanic wave on the plane‚Äôs surface, and because there is so much empty space between each dot the different kinds of radiation can inhabit the same space, passing through one another without interacting. The space between dots represents the low amount of energy in the system. Because EM radiation has relatively low energy and relatively low structure, it can be superimposed upon itself.

Nonlinear phenomena, on the other hand, is far easier to understand. Anything with sufficient density and structure becomes a nonlinear system: your body, objects in the room, waves in the ocean, cars, trees, bugs, lampposts, etc. Mathematically, the property of mass necessarily bestows a certain degree of nonlinearity, which is why your hand has to move the coffee mug out of the way to fill the same space, or a field mouse has to push leaves out of the way. **Nonlinearity is a function of density and structure.** In other words, **it is a function of mass.** And because E=MC\^2, it is ultimately a function of the condensation of energy.

Therefore,

Because nonlinearity is a function of mass, and mass is the condensation of energy in a field, **the same field can produce both linear and nonlinear phenomena.** In other words, activity in a unified field which is at first insubstantial, superimposable, diffuse and probabilistic in nature, can *become* ¬†the structured, tangible, macrocosmic domain of physical reality simply by condensing more energy into the system. **The microcosmic quantum could** ***become*** **the macrocosmic relativistic when it reaches a certain threshold of energy that we call mass, all within the context of a single field‚Äôs vibrations evolving into a nested hierarchy of structure.**

¬†

¬†

**Premise 2: Mass can be described as emerging from the topological contraction of that field**

¬†

This premise follows from the groundwork laid in the first. If the universe can be described as the activity of spacetime, then the next step is to explain how mass arises within that field. Traditionally, mass is treated as an inherent property of certain particles, granted through mechanisms such as the Higgs field. However, I propose that **mass is not an independent property but rather a localized, topological contraction of spacetime itself.**

In the context of a field-based universe, a topological contraction refers to a process by which a portion of the field densifies, self-stabilizing into a persistent structure. In other words, what we call ‚Äúmass‚Äù could be the result of the field folding or condensing into a self-sustaining curvature. This is not an entirely foreign idea. In general relativity, mass bends spacetime, creating gravitational curvature. But if we invert this perspective, it suggests that what we perceive as mass is simply the localized expression of that curvature. **Rather than mass warping spacetime, it is the act of spacetime curving in on itself that** ***manifests*** **as mass.**

If mass is a topological contraction, then gravity is the tension of the field pulling against that contraction. This reframing removes the need for mass to be treated as a separate, fundamental entity and instead describes it as an emergent property of spacetime‚Äôs dynamics.

This follows from Premise 1 in the following way:

¬†

*Premise 2, Principle 1:* ***Mass is the threshold at which a field‚Äôs linear vibration becomes nonlinear***

Building on the distinction between linear and nonlinear phenomena from Premise 1, mass can be understood as the **threshold** at which a previously linear (superimposable) vibration becomes nonlinear. As energy density in the field increases, certain excitations self-reinforce and stabilize into discrete, non-interactable entities. This transition from linear to nonlinear behavior marks the birth of mass.

This perspective aligns well with existing physics. Consider QFT: particles are modeled as excitations in their respective fields, but these excitations follow strict quantization rules, preventing them from existing in fractional or intermediate states (as discussed in Premise 1, Principle 1). The reason for this could be that stable mass requires a complete topological contraction, meaning partial contractions self-annihilate before becoming observable. Moreover, energy concentration in spacetime behaves in a way that suggests a critical threshold effect. Low-energy fluctuations in a field remain ephemeral (as virtual particles), but at high enough energy densities, they transition into persistent, observable mass. This suggests **a direct correlation between mass and field curvature** ‚Äì mass arises not as a separate entity but as the *natural consequence* of a sufficient accumulation of energy forcing a localized contraction in spacetime.

Therefore,

Vibration is a topological distortion in a field, and it has a threshold at which linearity becomes nonlinearity, and this is what we call mass. **Mass can thus be understood as a contraction of spacetime;** a condensation within a condensate; the collapse of a plenum upon itself resulting in the formation of a tangible ‚Äúknot‚Äù of spacetime.

¬†

¬†

**Conclusion**

To sum up my hypothesis so far I have argued that it is, in principle, possible that:

1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Spacetime alone exists fundamentally, but with a vibratory quality.

2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Random vibrations over infinite time in the fundamental medium inevitably generate a nested hierarchy of structure ‚Äì what we detect as quantum fields and particles

3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† As quantum fields and particles interact in the ways observed by QFT, mass emerges as a form of high-energy, nonlinear vibration, representing the topological transformation of spacetime into ‚Äúphysical‚Äù reality

Now, if mass is a contracted region of the unified field, then gravity becomes a much more intuitive phenomenon. Gravity would simply be the felt tension of spacetime‚Äôs topological distortion as it generates mass, analogous to how a knot tied in stretched fabric would be surrounded by a radius of tightened cloth that ‚Äúpulls toward‚Äù the knot. **This would mean that gravity is not an external force, but the very process by which mass comes into being.** The attraction we feel as gravity would be a residual effect of spacetime condensing its internal space upon a point, generating the spherical ‚Äústretched‚Äù topologies we know as geodesics.

This model naturally explains why all mass experiences gravity. In conventional physics, it is an open question why gravity affects all forms of energy and matter. If mass and gravity are two aspects of the same contraction process, then gravity is a fundamental property of mass itself. This also helps to reconcile the apparent disparity between gravity and quantum mechanics. Current models struggle to reconcile the smooth curvature of general relativity with the discrete quantization of QFT. However, if mass arises from field contractions, then gravity is not a separate phenomenon that must be quantized ‚Äì it is already built into the structure of mass formation itself.

Quantum gravity theories predict a hypothetical force-carrying particle (the graviton), but no experiment has ever detected it. This model suggests that if gravity is not a force between masses but rather the felt effect of topological contraction, then there is no need for a graviton to mediate gravitational interactions.

¬†

Predictions to test the hypothesis

1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Microscopic field knots as the basis of mass

If mass is a local contraction of the field, then at very small scales we might find evidence of this in the form of stable, topologically-bound regions of spacetime, akin to microscopic ‚Äúknots‚Äù in the field structure. Experiments could look for deviations in how mass forms at small scales, or correlations between vacuum fluctuations and weak gravitational curvatures

2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† A fundamental energy threshold between linear and nonlinear realities

This model implies that reality shifts from quantum-like (linear, superimposable) to classical-like (nonlinear, interactive) at a fundamental energy density. If gravity and mass emerge from field contractions, then there should be a preferred frequency or resonance that represents that threshold.

3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Black hole singularities

General relativity predicts that mass inside a black hole collapses to a singularity of infinite density, which is mathematically problematic (or so I‚Äôm led to believe). But if mass is a contraction of spacetime, then black holes may not contain a true singularity but instead reach a finite maximum contraction, possibly leading to an ultra-dense but non-divergent state. Could this be tested mathematically?

4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† A potential explanation for dark matter

We currently detect the gravitational influence of dark matter, but its source remains unknown. If spacetime contractions create gravity, then not all gravitational effects need to correspond to observable particles, per se. Some regions of space could be contracted without containing traditional mass, mimicking the effects of dark matter.

¬†

Obvious flaws and areas for further refinement in this hypothesis

1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Lack of a mathematical framework

2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This hypothesis suggests that mass is a contraction of spacetime, but does not specify what *causes* the field to contract in the first place.

3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† There is currently no direct observational or experimental evidence that spacetime contracts in a way that could be interpreted as mass formation (that I am aware of)

4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† If mass is a contraction of spacetime, how does this reconcile with the wave-particle duality and probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics?

5.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† If gravity is not a force but the felt effect of spacetime contraction, then why does it behave in ways that resemble a traditional force?

6.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† If mass is a spacetime contraction, how does it interact with energy conservation laws? Does this contraction involve a hidden cost?

7.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Why is gravity so much weaker than the other fundamental forces? Why would spacetime contraction result in such a discrepancy in strength?



\-

¬†

As I stated at the beginning, I have no formal training in these disciplines, and this hypothesis is merely the result of my dwelling on these broad concepts. I have no means to determine if it is a mathematically viable train of thought, but I have done my best to present what I hope is a coherent set of ideas. I am extremely interested in feedback, especially from those of you who have formal training in these fields. If you made it this far, I deeply appreciate your time and attention.",1,1740426987.0,QuantumPhysics,4,1.0,False
1ixb9ac,https://www.reddit.com/r/MauiVisitors/comments/1ixb9ac/haleakala_rth_and_honua_kai_trip_update_itinerary/,"Haleakala, RTH, and Honua Kai Trip Update & Itinerary","We were on Maui from 2/5-2/14 and absolutely LOVED our trip. My husband, myself, and our 5yo daughter. Sharing in case this is helpful to others in their planning. We made some choices that are unpopular on here and are SO happy we did. We wanted our trip to be a balance of doing things we adults wanted to do/see and also catering to our daughter's interests (mainly: swimming in the pool). All three of us are well traveled, easy going/adaptable, not prone to motion sickness, and people who like a mix of adventures and relaxation.

Overall, I'd say if you're going to do the RTH with kids, I highly recommend staying at least 1 night. We stayed 2 nights in Hana, which essentially let us do the RTH spread out over 3 days rather than crammed into 1, which kept it enjoyable for all 3 of us. We also knew we weren't going to try to make every stop - just some highlights, but it was well worth it for us. It's not necessary (and many would say not advisable) to combine it with sunrise at Haleakala, but if you want to do both and don't have an extra night, this did work well for us. 

  
**Wednesday, 2/5: arrive**

\- Arrived OGG, got rental car, stayed near the airport.   
\- Tin Roof for dinner. Quick and delicious. 

**Thursday, 2/6: Sunrise @ Haleakala, drive to Hana**

\- woke up at 4am (8am at home, so not too bad), got on the road by 5am, and arrived at Haleakala by 630am. Kiddo fell back asleep in the car. We found a Starbucks that opens at 430 to grab coffee and breakfast foods. Was very cold and windy, so 30 min was max time our daughter would have tolerated sitting in the cold, but she was very excited and curious once the sun came up. Husband said the drive to the summit in the dark was the hardest driving of the day, and not too bad. We did the junior ranger program, which was a highlight! Started the sliding sands trail and did the short trail to the summit - kiddo loved both but i'd pick sliding sands if you were just going to do one. We prob went about 3/4 mile out, then turned around and came back but the views were amazing and we literally walked \*through\* clouds. 

\- Kula Lodge for brunch. Adorable, charming, delicious. 

\- Drove to Hana (with all of our luggage in the trunk; packed a backpack with the stuff we'd want for the day, kept it in the backseat to take with us at stops). Stopped at Keane Arboretum to see the rainbow trees and many other plants and the Ke'ane peninsula to watch the waves crashing into the lava. Got ice cream at Coconut Glens, an absolute gem! The pineapple/coconut was our favorite. 

\- Checked into Hana Kai hotel for 2 nights. Lovely place, gorgeous views, and slept listening to the sound of the waves both nights. Def recommend this hotel if you're going to stay in Hana. 

\- Hasegawa General Store (the song about this place is now stuck in my head) for a few groceries, then food trucks for dinner (the Thai food was delicious). 

**Friday, 2/7: Pipiwai Trail and Wai'anapanapa State Park**

\- Kiddo was admittedly pretty whiny for the first mile or so of the hike. Snacks helped. Took us about 2+ hours to get to the falls, ate our sandwiches and hung out there for about 30 min, and then took about an hour to get back. The bamboo forest was super cool and I'm glad we did this hike, but I prob wouldn't recommend it for a kid under 5 unless they're very high energy and will have the stamina/interest. Our 5yo did feel very accomplished and proud though!

\- Huli Huli Chicken for a late lunch afterward, was a cool way to see the red sand beach without actually visiting it, which seems like it's discouraged for tourists. 

\- Wai'anapanapa State Park - we had a 3pm reservation and got there closer to 4. They still let us in, but they def shut things down around 530pm. Was enough time to hang at the beach, play with the black sand, and we did part of the coastal trail there (just to the top of the cliffs). Didn't make it over to the blow hole, though. Wish we'd had a little more time here - it's gorgeous and would've loved to just hang/wander a bit more. 

\- Dinner (we made a res) at Hana Ranch Restaurant

**Saturday, 2/8: Drive from Hana to Kaanapali**

\- Stopped at the Lava Tubes, got there right as they opened. Friendly couple who own it, and a worthwhile stop. My daughter didn't love it (my husband did and would've spent more time down there), but the couple there invited us to pick fruit from their trees afterward, which was very fun and had us all leaving there in a great mood! We wanted to stop by the Kahanu Garden, but the couple at the Lava Tubes let us know the garden isn't open on weekends. 

\- Nahiku Marketplace - got lunch and smoothies there

\- Pua'a Ka'a State Wayside - our daughter was adamant she didn't want to swim in a waterfall pool, so we stopped here just to see a waterfall since it's right next to the highway. We went and looked at it, then she changed her mind and wanted to get in! We only went about knee deep, (she didn't want to go in further than that) which felt like a reasonable balance of adventure and not getting bacterial infections.

\- Checked into Honua Kai (Konea tower) and had dinner at Duke's for sunset (we made a res in advance)

**Sunday, 2/9: Honua Kai pool, Kaanapali beach walk**

\- Hung at the hotel - checked out the various pools, went to the beach, relaxed. Never had a hard time finding a pool chair, which was great. Pools were warmer by mid morning/afternoon, so we spent more time at the beach earlier on. 

\- Husband woke up early to grab some groceries at the store across the street, which was reasonably priced. Small, generic souvenirs are also cheaper there (flower hair clip for kids, chocolate covered mac nuts, coffee) than in the gift shops. 

\- Walked the beach walk all the way down to the Hyatt Regency (saw the penguins). Stopped for ice cream along the way, let the kiddo play/climb at Whalers Village for a while, had dinner at Monkeypod. We took our umbrella stroller so kiddo didn't have to walk the entire way. Used the resort shuttle to come pick us up at the end of the night, which was really convenient. 

**Monday, 2/10: Lounged at Honua Kai, Maui Nui Luau**

\- Hung out at Honua Kai pools/beach, had lunch in our room

\- Luau at the Sheraton at Black Rock. We used the shuttle service to go there/back, which was great, and we booked this one bc kids 5 and under are free, and it doubled as a way to see the divers at Black Rock. Luau's are a little kitchy but we had a great time!

**Tuesday, 2/11: Nakalele Blowhole, Gazebo Restaurant, Kapalua Coastal Trail**

\- We drove up to the Nakalele Blowhole, which was very cool to see! We stayed pretty high up and still had a great view of it (and it's gorgeous there), but you can go much closer if you want to (just don't go too close!)

\- Went to the Gazebo restaurant for lunch. We got there at 1245pm and only waited about 5 minutes. Food and views were incredible, and it was special to be there with my family bc I have memories of going there as a kid. 

\- We drove a bit and paid $29 (!!) for parking and walked about 1 mile of the Kapalua Coastal Trail, then turned around and came back. Didn't make it all the way to Kapalua Bay, but very nice views. It's hot bc there's no shade. My husband and I enjoyed it and would have done the whole thing, but this was about as much as we could do with a young kid. 

\- Swam at Honua Kai and got carry out from Duke's to eat on pool chairs while we watched sunset. 

**Wednesday, 2/12: Whalewatching & Shave Ice**

\- Went on a whalewatching tour with the Pacific Whale Foundation. My husband and I LOVED it, we saw tons of whales, three swam under/along side our boat!! Our daughter was totally uninterested, but content to just eat snacks purchased on board.

\- Ululani's Shave Ice in Kihei - OMG, this was incredible! We learned from others to get the fresh mochi topping, and later learned from our shuttle driver that the move is to also get coconut ice cream on the bottom. Daughter had no interest in whales, but was mesmerized by watching them make shave ice haha. 

\- There's a cute farmers market right next door, where we got an acai bowl, veggie loaded bagel, and banana bread to share. 

\- Did some more swimming at Honua Kai, and walked to the food trucks to pick up dinner. Ate from pool chairs again, facing out toward the ocean for sunset. Did some night swimming after dinner and kiddo learned the joy of a night time hot tub. 

  
**Thursday, 2/13: Relax, Leilani's for dinner**

\- Spent the whole day just relaxing at Honua Kai. Ordered Duke's poolside for lunch. 

\- Took the shuttle to Whaler's Village, shopped for souvenirs, wandered around a bit

\- Dinner at Leilani's. Gorgeous view, sunset. More night swimming/hot tub after dinner.

  
**Friday, 2/14: Head home** 

\- Left at 445am to head back for an 8am flight. Airport lines were short, but it was early and we have TSA pre check. ",1,1740426979.0,MauiVisitors,0,0.67,False

It wasn‚Äôt often she slept in‚Äîmost mornings, she was up before him, already moving, already handling something before the day had even begun. But today, she was still here. Still resting.

For a long moment, he didn‚Äôt move. He simply lay there, listening to the soft sound of her breathing, feeling the steady rise and fall of her chest against him. These moments were rare, and he wasn‚Äôt the type to waste them.

Carefully, he shifted his hand to her back, letting his fingers trace slow, absentminded patterns against her skin. She stirred slightly, murmuring something unintelligible, but didn‚Äôt wake. He smirked to himself. She always acted like she had everything under control, like she could take on the world and never falter, but right now, she was just his wife‚Äîsoft, warm, tucked against him like she belonged there.

Eventually, he eased himself out of bed, moving carefully to avoid waking her. The air was cool against his skin as he pulled on a pair of sweatpants and ran a hand through his hair. He glanced back at Valyria, still fast asleep, then quietly stepped out of the bedroom.

The house was quiet‚Äîanother rarity. He was used to the sound of the kids, the morning chaos, Valyria already managing a dozen things at once. But right now, it was just him. He made his way to the kitchen, rubbing the sleep from his eyes as he started the coffee maker. The rich scent of coffee filled the air, and he let out a slow breath, leaning against the counter as he waited.

After a moment, he moved to the stove. He wasn‚Äôt much of a cook, but he knew enough to make breakfast‚Äîscrambled eggs, toast, bacon. Simple, but enough to let her know he was thinking about her. She took care of so much, handled everything so effortlessly. He wanted to give her this, even if it was something small.

As he set her plate down on the table, he heard the soft shuffle of footsteps behind him. He turned to find Valyria standing in the doorway, her hair slightly messy from sleep, wearing one of his old shirts.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre up early,‚Äù she murmured, her voice still heavy with sleep.

He smirked. ‚ÄúFigured I‚Äôd let you sleep in for once.‚Äù

She arched a brow, amused, but didn‚Äôt argue. Instead, she walked over, wrapping her arms around his waist and pressing her face against his chest. He stood still, letting her take what she needed, his large hands settling on her back.

After a moment, she pulled back and glanced at the table. ‚ÄúYou made breakfast?‚Äù

He shrugged. ‚ÄúFigured you deserved it.‚Äù

A small smile tugged at her lips. She didn‚Äôt say thank you, but she didn‚Äôt have to. He could see it in her expression, in the way she reached for the cup of coffee he‚Äôd set out for her, in the way she sat down and took the first bite of the meal he‚Äôd made.

Ronan sat across from her, drinking his own coffee as the morning light filtered through the window. The world outside would start moving soon‚Äîthe kids would wake up, responsibilities would demand their attention‚Äîbut for now, they had this.

Over the past three years, we've seen a surge in companies specializing in humanoid robots, flying cars, and advanced AI-driven machines. These technologies are no longer just concepts‚Äîthey are expected to be commercially available before the early 2030s. This raises the question: What kind of technology will dominate the next decade?

One of the most groundbreaking developments comes from Neuralink, Elon Musk‚Äôs company, which is working on brain-machine interface (BMI) technology. This involves neural implants that could potentially allow us to control devices directly with our minds, opening new possibilities in medical treatment and cognitive enhancement. If successful, this could revolutionize the way we interact with technology and even restore lost senses or abilities.

Additionally, advancements in Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) will likely create immersive experiences that blur the line between the physical and digital worlds. These technologies will transform everything from gaming to healthcare, education, and remote work.

Meanwhile, humanoid robots are becoming increasingly capable, with advancements in artificial intelligence enabling them to perform complex tasks and interact with humans more naturally. These robots could become commonplace in homes, workplaces, and industries, performing everything from domestic chores to assisting with complex surgeries.

Flying cars, once a sci-fi dream, are slowly becoming a reality. Companies are actively developing vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft that could serve as personal transport, revolutionizing urban mobility and potentially reducing traffic congestion.

However, all of this depends on global economic stability. If the economy improves and these innovations become accessible to the masses, rather than just the elite, we may truly step into a new era of technological advancement.

What are your predictions for the shape of technology in 2030s?

1ixaz1q,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1ixaz1q/how_long_should_a_mid_level_sa_last/,How long should a mid level SA last?,"Meant to ask this in a previous post, but decided to just make this a new discussion. 

I have a Miele CM6350, about 7 years old which looks like its about to give out soon (coffee grounds spilling inside the brew unit, clogging up of grounds, etc.). That was about $2K seven years ago, so almost $300 per year. To be honest I was expecting it to last 10 to 15 years for that price with maybe replacements of some of the internal plastic parts. We are not heavy users (3-5 espresso/coffee shots per day, rarely use the milk frothing function - primarily because the milk froth is disappointing), so I am a bit disappointed in this machines longevity, but maybe I just have unreasonable expectations?

For a SA between $1,500 and $2,500, what is the expectation of useable life? 

Bonus question: My wife likes coffee compared to espresso or americano, so she uses the largest amount of ground coffee the machine will let you use and then does a super long extraction (about 8 floz of water). Is there any drawback to that method (e.g. it stresses a SA more than regular espresso shots)?

Now my employer is in a tough spot because they would do anything to keep this account. They run three cafes. 

Here‚Äôs the rub. This cafe is a sugar shack that had me take their espresso significantly darker so that they could get away with only one shot in a 20 oz drink. They don‚Äôt know how to pull decent shots and they don‚Äôt understand coffee. There were zero questions asked of them. It was just assumed that the problem was with the roaster and my employer is desperate to keep this account. The only thing different about my roasting was a different ethiopia (20% of the blend). There were complaints from customers but it‚Äôs hard to tell if the cafe wasn‚Äôt suggesting that it might be ‚Äúoff‚Äù to customers and asking for feedback. I think it‚Äôs likely that a change in ethiopia could have made the difference here but I‚Äôm unhappy with the way it has all been handled.

I wanted to make something that would make it a little easier to stay on top of the newest openings and events around Vegas.. If you're looking for new places to eat, drink, or just do something different this week, here's some ideas?

# Brand New:

* [Unionbiscuit](https://www.unionbiscuitlv.com/)¬†(Southwest) ‚Äì If you love biscuits, this place is dangerous. Scratch-made, buttery perfection, served up with killer breakfast sandwiches and a solid coffee menu.
* [Le Club by Partage](https://vegas.eater.com/2025/2/18/24368107/best-french-restaurant-las-vegas-open-new-champagne-bar-partage-le-club)¬†(Chinatown) ‚Äì A whole bar dedicated to champagne. Over 80 bottles to choose from, plus cocktails and fancy snacks. Feels like a low-key flex just walking in.
* [Cookio Caf√©](https://www.instagram.com/cookiolv/)¬†(Southwest) ‚Äì These guys built a good following selling their cookies online, and now they‚Äôve got a storefront. Solid cookies, pastries, and‚Äîrandomly‚Äîa really good Cuban sandwich.

# Coming Soon:

* [Doberman Drawing Room](https://www.dobermandtlv.com/)¬†(Arts District, Spring 2025) ‚Äì This one is a little interesting. They've got a waitlist for their membership that requires you to answer a personality quiz and pay a $3000 fee. You don't have to be a member to drink there though. It's got ex-Fontainebleau mixologist Juyoung Kang behind the menu and she's making a Tom Kha Fizz that I'm really excited to try.
* [Nocturno Cocktail Bar](https://www.nocturnovegas.com/)¬†(Arts District, Spring 2025) ‚Äì Inspired by Mexico City‚Äôs best bars, Nocturno is bringing Latin American cocktail culture to Vegas. The owners say they would prefer if you ordered off-menu, and the bartenders just make you what you want based on vibes and preference.
* [PISCES Bar & Seafare](https://www.wynnlasvegas.com/dining/fine-dining/pisces-bar-and-seafare)¬†(Wynn, Spring 2025) ‚Äì High-end seafood, caviar, and cocktails in a sleek, ocean-inspired setting. Fiola Mare was actually supposed to be here before they changed their mind.

# Might want to buy tickets:

* [Universal Horror Unleashed](https://www.universalhorrorunleashed.com/)¬†(Area15, Aug 14) ‚Äì It's nearly ready. Fully themed bars, movie-level sets, and actual scare actors roaming around. 4 themed haunted houses.
* [Rolling Stone Presents: Amplified](https://www.rollingstone.com/product-recommendations/lifestyle/buy-rolling-stone-amplified-tickets-online-las-vegas-1235266708/)¬†(Illuminarium, Mar 12) ‚Äì A giant, immersive rock 'n' roll trip with 360-degree visuals, legendary performances, and behind-the-scenes music history.

On waking up immediately outsource your laundry, meal prep, and small talk to ""freelance contractors"" (aka friends or roommates) to maximise your ""personal bandwidth.""   


Be a one person corporation by negotiating every interaction like a merger‚Äîyour buddy asking to hang out is a ""strategic partnership"" pitch, complete with a PowerPoint on mutual ROI. 

Relationships should transition into asset management. 

Dating? That‚Äôs just scouting for a high-value acquisition‚Äîsomeone to boost your ""brand equity"" or diversify your ""portfolio"" of traits. 

Think of your kids like R&D projects‚Äîlong-term investments with uncertain payouts.   
  
And forget about chilling on the couch; downtime is an ""unproductive overhead"" unless it‚Äôs branded as ""self-maintenance for operational efficiency.""

On the flip side, you could gain some corporate perks. You could be  forming ""personal boards of advisors"" (therapist, gym bro, that one friend who‚Äôs oddly good with money) to strategize life moves. Risk mitigation would kick in‚Äîmaybe you‚Äôd A/B test your haircut before committing.   
  
But prepare for Endless self-audits. Every coffee spill or awkward joke could trigger a ""performance review"" in your head, and guilt trips would come with a side of ""stakeholder dissatisfaction metrics.""



In the B2B vibe, you approach others like mini-enterprises pitching services. Need a ride? Your friend doesn‚Äôt just say yes‚Äîthey send a ""proposal"" outlining fuel costs, ETA, and how their ""reliable transport solutions"" beat the competition (aka your other buddy with a clunky sedan).   
  
You trade favors like companies trade bulk deals‚Äîbartering ""two hours of lawn-mowing capacity"" for ""one night of premium babysitting services."" 

Handshakes include verbal NDAs, and your group chat might demand a ""mutual value-add clause"" before planning a barbecue. 

Everyone‚Äôs a vendor, a client, and a middleman all at once‚Äîyour neighbor‚Äôs not just lending a ladder, they‚Äôre ""optimizing cross-household asset utilization.""

To secure lucrative government contracts, prepare to game that system by cozying up to city council members at the farmer‚Äôs market, slipping them a homemade pie while whispering, ""I‚Äôd be perfect to mow the park lawns‚Äîmy track record‚Äôs spotless."" 

Submit ""RFPs"" (requests for proposal) to repaint the community centre, complete with a 50-page PDF on your ""proven grass-cutting methodologies"" from years of suburban yard work. 

Nepotism is your friend ‚Äîyour cousin‚Äôs dog-walking gig gets ""priority contractor status"" because he knows the mayor‚Äôs assistant. 

Consider lobbying for ""personal infrastructure credits"" to fix your driveway if it vaguely benefits the neighborhood.

The catch? The red tape‚Äî prepare for hardships as you try to ""secure a sole-source justification"" for shovelling snow off a public sidewalk.   


To ROI your life to the max, roll out a ""personal IPO""‚Äîsell ""shares"" of your time and talents to friends and family (payable in pizza or good vibes), promising ""dividends"" like epic movie nights or homemade cookies.   


When life gets tough‚Äîlike spilling juice on your shirt‚Äîyou spin it into a ""pivot,"" declaring, ""This stain represents a bold rebranding into avant-garde fashion!"" 

And at day‚Äôs end, you don‚Äôt just sleep‚Äîyou ""enter a state of regenerative scalability,"" prepping for tomorrow‚Äôs ""market dominance"" (aka making toast).

You‚Äôre not just living‚Äîyou‚Äôre thriving as a one-person conglomerate!

I want a minimum wage job so I can buy overpriced coffee is that so hard?

I had an idea, that I could get the job, wait until they notice and ask me about it, then passively say ""yeah idk I kinda hate my managers."" theyll be delighted. ill keep saying I want to quit because the micromanaging sucks (scapegoating and now hopefully uBPD will now be proving how chill and not-micromanaging they are) and this will dangle the carrot of my unhappiness.

I need any little tricks up my sleeve that will make me feel more at ease so I can find a way to make this feel and actually become possible for me again.

You know how the machine alerts you after your coffee is made (or before) that the water tank needs refilling?

Yes well, I have found an issue when selecting a MILK RECIPE that does the coffee part first (eg:cappuccino mix, flat white), that after the coffee pour it decides to alert me that the water tank needs refilling. It does not complete the milk part of the drink. When I refill the tank and insert it, the whole drink is abandoned and returns to the main menu.

The milk doesn't even need water! And why cannot it just wait until the end of my drink to alert me.

This does not occur for recipes that have milk first because it doesn't get a chance to realise it is low until after the coffee pour.

            A true story


-To those of you who believe that Human Beings are creatures of free will, I invite you to take a trip with me back in time‚Ä¶ when in a dream I saw a disturbing glimpse of my future. (I was late for work), and no matter how hard I tried to avoid it, I ended up causing it to happen in real life.

When I was just a 16 year old boy, before the advent of cell phones, streaming media, or even the internet for that matter, I didn‚Äôt know much about the ‚Äòparanormal‚Äô and things of that nature. No, my biggest pursuits were comic books, collecting Hot Wheels cars, and supporting my video game addiction over at the local arcade.
  
In case you‚Äôre wondering how old I am, the year was 1978. That would make me currently 55 years old.
  
Anyway, so I got this little weekend job down at the swap meet (about two blocks from my house) helping out this old Chinese vendor named Chung. The job was simple; meet Chung at the Drive-in theater early Saturday morning to help set up his vendor stall with merchandise consisting of knock-off Gucci bags, pocketbooks, and assorted women‚Äôs shoes, then assisting him throughout the day. At the end of the day Chung would hand me a nice crispy $10.00 bill. 
  
I was making 20 bucks a week, which in 1978 afforded me the latest issues of Mad Magazine and collectible Hot Wheels, as well as a shot at that new video game over at the arcade called ‚ÄòSpace Invaders‚Äô.
  
On one Friday night I sat on the edge of my bed, reached over to my nightstand and picked up my little alarm clock to set it for work the next morning. Swap meet vendors had to be there early so that they could set up and be ready to meet the throngs of shoppers coming in at 7:00 when the ticket gates opened.
  
My alarm clock was an old vintage wind-up handed down to me from my grandmother. It had a round face and two little bells on top that would ring when the hour hand reached the third hand, (also known as the ‚Äòalarm hand‚Äô). I set the alarm hand for 5:30, wound the clock spring, and placed it back on my nightstand. I prided myself on being on time‚Ä¶a characteristic that was instilled in me from the time I learned to work for my own money.
  
I was an industrious young man of morals and integrity. I had the world by the horns‚Ä¶ or so I thought.
  
I put my pajamas on and laid my work clothes out on a chair, then tucked myself in for the night. I must have slept extremely well that night. We‚Äôre talking deep R.E.M. sleep. The kind where time seems to no longer exist. Then I had a lucid dream. A very unsettling lucid dream. It went something like this:
  
I‚Äôm walking through a door, and there, about 30 to 35 feet in front of me was my boss, Chung, squatting down in front of his vendor stall that was completely set up, with purses and handbags hanging from hooks on the shade structure. His display tables were adorned with colorful tablecloths, loaded with pocketbooks, coin purses and other accessories. 
  
He was straightening a pair of red shoes he had arranged on the tarmac up front. I had missed setup. I was suddenly flushed with the realization that I was late for work. That feeling of pure anxiety washed over me like a bucket of ice cold water.
  
I stood shocked and dumbfounded as Chung looked over his shoulder and spotted me. He nodded his head with a grin and started to speak. But the sound that came out was not that of his voice, but a loud, steady ringing sound. The sound of a bell.
  
Suddenly I was ripped from my dream, and I bolted upright in bed to the sound of my alarm clock going off. It was 5:30 and time to get ready for work. I reached over and turned it off, then rubbed my eyes, anxious with that feeling of being late that lingered with repeating visions from that stupid dream. 
  
I felt like I had just closed my eyes only to be rudely awakened again. I shrugged it off and went to the bathroom to begin my morning ritual for work. 
  
But the dream kept replaying itself over and over in my head like a 10-second video clip stuck on a loop. The finished displays. The red shoes. The grin on Chung‚Äôs face. The feeling of being late. And what the hell was he about to say just before my alarm clock jolted me out of it? I just couldn‚Äôt shake it despite the fact that I had gotten up on time and there was nothing keeping me from getting to work on time that morning. 
  
Nonetheless, I picked up my pace a little bit just to make sure that dream playing out over and over again, and that feeling of dread that comes with showing up late for work, would just go away.
  
I felt a bit silly as I donned my clothes a little quicker, and tied my old suede wallabies a little faster than I normally would. I slipped my wrist watch on and checked the time against my alarm clock for a match. ‚ÄúThis is ludicrous‚Äù, I thought to myself. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way I can be late. If anything I‚Äôll be super early.‚Äù
  
I cut the time I would normally spend getting ready to go to work in half by skipping breakfast, and set out on foot at 10 minutes to 6 in the chilly morning darkness toward the Drive-in theater that waited for me about a block and a half away from my house. 
  
The light of dawn wouldn‚Äôt break for another half-hour or so. And, as it has been all season, my job was to show up around 6:30 a.m., meet Chung at our usual spot, and we would knock out the setup by 7:00‚Ä¶just in time for the shoppers to be allowed in. 
  
But this time it would be ‚Äúa little bit different‚Äù I thought to myself as I shuffled down my empty street toward the quiet four lane thoroughfare.  Ignoring the crosswalk, I jogged across the thoroughfare toward the main gate of the Drive-in theater with its landmark forty-foot screen looming in the distance. 
  
The dream quickened my pace. I scoffed, and fought the urge to break into a run. 
  
It was unusually foggy that morning too. As I made my way through the shadows I couldn‚Äôt help but notice the ominous looking halos of swirling mist surrounding each street lamp. The theme song from ‚ÄòThe Twilight Zone‚Äô kept trying to seep into the cracks in my overactive imagination. 
  
And that damn dream. That dream was still fresh on my mind as I entered the gate and waved at the security guard leaning in the door frame of his guard shack. He recognized me with a nod of his head, his face half-lit by one single incandescent light bulb from within. He pulled the cigarette from his lips with thumb and forefinger and let out a puff of thick, gray smoke. ‚ÄúHere a little early, arencha?‚Äù 
  
I shook my head and shoved my hands in my pockets as I thought about how ridiculous it was for me to be here at this hour. There was literally no one there except for the snack bar/caf√© crew in the center of the Drive-in  lot. I headed straight for it. I needed to get my head on straight. I needed a cup of coffee and an old-fashioned glazed donut. 
  
I walked into the caf√© and up to the service counter. The place was completely empty  except for those bleary-eyed workers who were busy doing their morning prep for the coming rush of customers. ‚Äútheir day starts a lot earlier than mine‚Äù, I reckoned as I took in the aroma of fresh coffee and baked goods. 
  
I ordered my cup of coffee and an old-fashioned glazed with a $2 bill, and got two quarters change. I grabbed an Auto Trader magazine from a rack by the entrance and scanned the area for a good place to sit.
  
Through large windows I could see a panoramic view of the outside area. I spotted a booth and sat down from where I had an unobstructed view of our spot. I wanted to see Chung the moment he arrived so I could go out to greet him early. 
  
I felt so foolish as I stirred the sugar and powdered creamer into my cup, and chuckled to myself as the dream faded for now, my mind preoccupied by the taste of fresh coffee and the flavor of that old fashioned glazed delicacy. 
  
About halfway through my cup of coffee I glanced at my watch. It was 6:35 (about the time I would normally show up). By now the light of dawn was just beginning to illuminate the cloudless sky, and the fog that had invaded the early morning was gone. 
  
Vendors were rapidly arriving en masse, claiming their spots. The clinking and clanking of their shade structure poles reverberated throughout the Drive-in as the they got busy unloading their vehicles and setting up their vending stalls. 
  
Vendors began filing into the caf√© to get their morning caffeine and sugar fix. I stared blankly at our spot. Empty. Was Chung running late? I knew that his commute was considerably longer. His old cargo van had seen better days. 
  
Something was not right. The spaces on either side of ours were already busy with vendors and their helpers skillfully fastening leg poles to corner pieces, and stretching canvas tarps with bungee cords for shade.
  
I stepped outside to use the payphone that was mounted on the wall next to the restrooms. I figured I‚Äôd call Chung at home to see if he was there. But the pay phone had an ‚ÄòOut of Order‚Äô sign written in black marker taped across the coin slots. Go figure.
  
Back inside, I bought another cup of coffee with my last 50 cents. ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù If Chung didn‚Äôt show up by the time I finished the second cup, I reasoned, then I guess he‚Äôd be considered a no-show. 
  
Heck, I could just go home and crawl back into bed for a couple more hours before the rest of my family started to rouse. Godzilla and Kung Fu reruns on Saturday morning. Yes, just what the doctor ordered. 
  
I looked over to our spot again. It was completely vacant, surrounded by a sea of shade structures, tarps, goods, with cargo vans, box trucks, and just about anything you could haul stuff in that had materialized across the tarmac of the Drive-in theater as far as the eye could see. 
  
If you‚Äôve ever been to a swap meet you know what I‚Äôm talking about. It was now 7:00. It‚Äôs Showtime!
  
‚ÄúWell, I guess that‚Äôs it‚Äù, I thought to myself as I stood up and drank the last sip from my coffee cup. Chung is a no-show. That whole dream was such a‚Ä¶ well, it was just that‚Ä¶a dream. I was now free to go home and catch some shut eye, and to decompress from an otherwise stressful episode.
  
I headed for the exit on the other side of the now crowded caf√©. Beyond it was my home less than 10 minutes away. 
  
Through the windows on that side I could see the shoppers starting to flow in from the ticket line and fan out through the isles of waiting vendors. 
  
I grabbed the doorknob and pushed it outward, and then I felt a strange rush kind of like D√©j√† vu come over me. 
  
‚ÄúThis can‚Äôt be‚Ä¶‚Äù, I struggled to reason, as I walked out the door and saw‚Ä¶him. It was the dream. Only this time, for real.
  
I gazed in existential horror at Chung who squatted about 35 feet right in front of me. He was straightening a pair of brightly polished red pumps on display on the tarmac‚Ä¶and I was late.
  
My jaw went slack as my coffee cup fell from numb fingers. ‚ÄúChung?‚Äù
  
Chung looked over his shoulder in my direction. He had just finished setting up his stall. Every detail was there from the hanging handbags to the accessory tables and, well‚Ä¶you know the rest.
  
Chung‚Äôs gaze met mine; ‚ÄúOh there you are!‚Äù He said with a sheepish grin, ‚ÄúSorry, I forgot to tell you‚Ä¶I switched spots!‚Äù

1ixaiqr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1ixaiqr/what_do_you_think/,What do you think?,"I (F, 39) have been dating a man (47) for a couple of months. I like him a lot and feel like he is treating me as I would like to be treated (of course, I feel like being as great as I can with him, too), the sex is above my wildest expectations and everything seems awesome, a beautiful beginning of a possible relationship.

However. Because he has more money than I (I am pretty well off as well, definitely not in this for his money), I constantly feel like he's showing me stuff that is not good enough. I got tickets to see a play, he said ""for a Sunday evening, it was fine"" - mind you, he never made ME feel not good enough, just some of the things I do. My apartment is smaller and he was telling me how he hated living in a flat - but then quickly hugged me when he saw my face (we spend most of the indoor time at my place) and said that's not about me. I cannot really invite him to extra fancy restaurants (but I do pay sometimes when we go to one), but when i took him to my fav coffee place, his first reaction was to point out a spider. Fair enough, but i must add the coffee shop has lots of indoors plants and spiders can happen, it wasn't because it was a dirty place. 

Although he has never said anything directly about me, i feel like maybe he thinks i am not good for him. Men out there, please let me know if I'm crazy or I should have a chat about this with him. I really like him and don't want to hurt his feelings, but my stomach sinks everytime i hear one of those things... thanks.

1ixaelg,https://www.reddit.com/r/PuntaCana/comments/1ixaelg/occidental_caribe_do_not_go_here/,Occidental Caribe - DO NOT GO HERE,"My husband and I bid on and won a trip back in February 2024 at the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation dinner. We just completed that trip and found that there is no way we can‚Äôt warn the foundation and reservation company about the horrendous experience. We hope this will result in this option being removed as a bid item and possibly even a reimbursement of some kind as no one should ever go through what we went through.

To start we bid on the 4 night stay in the Caribbean for $2600 and won it at that as we were the only bid. We chose Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic as our destination. Once I was able to book it with HGA reservations, I was given the choice of only 3 hotel locations. I did my best to review some of them and settled on Occidental Caribe. Fast forward to us waiting a year for our trip and then flying there. The transportation through Amstar was ok but very dangerous driving. We arrived at the hotel and someone immediately with no communication took all of our luggage. We assumed maybe this was part of the process. We tried to check in and were told its actually 3pm. We were given key cards for towels and told they were $20 a piece if we lost them. We were told nothing about the hotel, the layout, the restaurants, our hotel room, nothing at all. Every person we tried to talk to only spoke Spanish. If you are catering to English speaking people I would assume otherwise.

So we wait till 3pm. We go back to the lobby which is full of people and are waiting. Meanwhile someone comes by and asks if we have a room, we say no, they take our towel cards and envelope and leave. We are told to wait there. Maybe 20 minutes later they come back and tell us to keep waiting and leave with our info again. Mind you, we still don‚Äôt have access to our own bags/luggage. Again another 20 minutes goes by and the man comes back with our cards and envelope and says we have another hour. The whole time waiting in the lobby we are bombarded with people trying to sell us dinner reservations, spa vouchers, telling us they will help us get to our room and carry our bags for a tip, etc. Finally my husband had to go find our luggage in a pile of others luggage outside. At 5pm we are given a room number. No other information at all. Except we are told some other man will take our bags up later. We said no and found our room ourselves. Information from the reservation agency showed gratuities included and this is not the case. You are expected to tip everyone from the front desk person to the lobby people, housekeeping, ‚Äúwaiters‚Äù that bring water.

In the room there is an electrical box falling off the wall with exposed wires. The bathroom ceiling is literally falling in. The air conditioner turns on and makes a very loud screaming sound the whole time and smells of very foul mold and mildew and you can see black dust/soot like material in the vent. The bathroom is an open room type shower toilet combo. Everything is soaking wet including the toilet paper, which we ran out of and couldn‚Äôt get more. The shower only turns on hot, there is no cool water to lower the temperature. The drain in the shower doesn‚Äôt drain properly and starts to flood the room. There is no hand soap at all. There is another drain in the middle of the room that has the most foul raw sewage smell coming from it that we had to keep the bathroom door closed, hold our breath and literally light a piece of paper on fire to get the smell of smoke in the room just to be able to handle it. There is a light on in the closet that never turns off. The bed was like sleeping on a board and had oil type stains on the sheets. The pillows were like clumps of foam in them. The tv is in Spanish. There is nothing in the room as to information at all except a folder of blank¬† papers. The minibar we were supposed to have in had one bottle of water and a coca cola. The room faced the pool which was fine however nightly this resort that is advertised as family friendly, there is a party at the pool or in the open lobby area adjacent that plays extremely loud dance party music till about 2 am. Our room was above the buffet which means you hear people all night long and then cleaning staff bang pans and dishes around and scream and yell at each other till again 2 am. The smell of the food is extremely nauseating.

Onto the food. This is supposed to be an all inclusive resort with snack bars, coffee bars, 11 restaurants and a buffet. That is not the case. There is a buffet which is inedible. I lived on cantaloupe for 4 days because it was the only edible food. I lost 4 lbs. There were people spitting food out on their plates, pouring drinks out, leaving plates of food because its so bad. I wouldn‚Äôt feed this food to an animal, it‚Äôs that bad. All of the food is wet of floating in water. I started taking food that looked edible like an apple and storing them because I was so hungry and needed food. We found out one of the sales people in the lobby could give us a reservation at a restaurant if we left with them the next day to their timeshare sales pitch. We were so hungry we took the reservation. It was for the Italian restaurant. We went there and it was closed. So what they do is they have multiple restaurants but they close them and combine them together at random tables outside and that‚Äôs where you eat. NO one tells you anything about this and if you are 10 minutes late they cancel you. So we found out from another guest. The food at this place was just as bad.

We were told we could make a reservation for the rest of the nights of our stay if we went at 7am to the guest services. Upon doing that, we were informed we only get one meal outside of the buffet per 4 days. Otherwise the buffet is our only choice of place to eat. We got one reservation at a Tokyo restaurant which at 7am was all that was left. You have to be formally dressed to eat there. It‚Äôs so extremely hot and loud and the food outside of the main course of rice and chicken, is again not food. The chef would sing and bang on tables etc which we understand is the environment but we were forced into it since they wouldn‚Äôt give us any other choices. There was a cancellation which allowed us to have the choice to eat there another night of our stay and we chose to not go back. You can‚Äôt drink the water there but you have to pay housekeeping to get another bottle of water.

Obviously weather can‚Äôt be controlled however since it downpour rained while we were there, the resort floods. The lobby, the walkways outside, everything. You have to walk through this flood to get to anything. While you are on the beach you are bombarded the whole time with sales people. Everything from hair braids, beads, hats, scarves, sunglasses, parasailing, pictures with animals that they will just put on you and then tell you to cash app them, henna tattoos, spa services. It‚Äôs non stop. The chairs on the beach are for the large part broken. You have to check out your towels and return them to get your key card back or you have to pay. When you check out of the hotel they give you¬† a piece of paper to take to another security/bell hop person who again tries to take your bags from you so you will tip him for ‚Äúhelping‚Äù. I left there with multiple bug bites from I don‚Äôt know what. We left this resort sick from the food we did get, the water, the heat, the air in the room and no sleep.

The first day we were there was so bad and every day after that even though we paid and waited for this trip we tried to find flights home. It was a vacation from hell. I can not believe that this is even offered as a choice of place to stay. I hope someone makes this right for us and never subjects someone else to this.",5,1740424908.0,PuntaCana,6,1.0,False

2.Panino al Harissa ‚Äì My friends ordered this without expecting much since they weren‚Äôt too hungry, but it completely exceeded their expectations. The flavors were spot on, and the balance of sauce, chicken, and vegetables was just right. A surprisingly great choice!

3. Tiramisu ‚Äì This place has always delivered an excellent Tiramisu, but unfortunately, this time it fell short. The texture wasn‚Äôt well set, and it turned out to be quite dry, which was disappointing compared to our previous experiences. Hope next time we'll not be disappointed.

4. Half & Half Pizza ‚Äì Carne Caricata (Pork) / Harissa Spice Chicken ‚Äì The pizza was absolutely delicious, with fresh, high-quality ingredients that really stood out. The Harissa Spice Chicken side had a rich, tomato-forward sauce, which was a refreshing change and added a unique touch to the overall flavor. A great choice for those looking for something different!

Overall, it was a great experience, and my friends absolutely loved the place, made even better with a 20% Zomato discount!

1ixadha,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBagCheck/comments/1ixadha/does_the_travelpro_maxlite_5_travel_tote_live_up/,Does the Travelpro Maxlite 5 Travel Tote live up to its lightweight promise? A review.,"Using the Travelpro Maxlite 5 Softside Lightweight Underseat Carry-On Travel Tote has been an intriguing experience for someone like me who‚Äôs always on the go. This compact and ultra-lightweight travel bag by Travelpro claims to offer a perfect balance between convenience and durability. Here‚Äôs how it truly measures up.

**Capacity & Organization**  
Packing this bag for a weekend getaway or a short business trip? You‚Äôll appreciate its well-thought-out design. The interior is surprisingly spacious for an underseat bag, accommodating clothes, a toiletry kit, and even some tech gadgets like chargers or a tablet. Its built-in pockets make organizing easy, while the front flap offers quick access to essentials like a passport or boarding pass. However, I found myself wishing for a few more compartments to better separate personal items, as everything tends to blend together after a bit of rummaging.

**Handles & Comfort**  
Carrying this tote is genuinely a breeze. The padded top handle feels comfortable even when the bag is fully loaded. For longer hauls through airports, the removable padded shoulder strap is a lifesaver. My shoulders didn‚Äôt feel strained, even after carrying it for hours. There‚Äôs also a rear strap that allows it to securely stack onto the handle of a rolling suitcase, a feature I frequently used during my last trip.

[Check Travelpro Maxlite 5 Softside Lightweight Underseat Carry-On Travel Tote price on Amazon.](https://bagsby.com/check/b07bkkmzwn/)

**Design & Materials**  
The 100% polyester fabric used here is durable and features a stain-resistant, water-repellent Duraguard coating. While it doesn‚Äôt scream luxury, the material holds up well against the typical wear and tear of travel. I spilled coffee on it during a layover, and a quick wipe was all it took to clean it up. The zipper pulls are ergonomic and easy to grip, but they feel slightly less sturdy than I‚Äôd like for long-term use.

**Weather Resistance**  
Caught in a drizzle while heading to a hotel, I tested its weatherproofing claims. The bag held its ground, with no water seeping into my belongings. However, I wouldn‚Äôt rely on it to protect against heavy downpours for prolonged periods.

**Size & Airline Compatibility**  
This tote fits perfectly under the seat on most major airlines, as promised. Being someone who avoids checking luggage at all costs, I found this feature a game-changer. Measuring 11 x 18 x 8 inches and weighing just 1.6 pounds, it‚Äôs ideal for travelers aiming to maximize carry-on space.

**Security & Locking System**  
Security-wise, the zippers are lockable, which adds a layer of reassurance. While it‚Äôs not a robust anti-theft system, it‚Äôs sufficient for casual travel. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend leaving valuables unattended in it for long, though.

**Weight & Portability**  
The standout feature for me has to be how lightweight it is. Weighing only 1.6 pounds, it‚Äôs one of the lightest travel totes I‚Äôve used. This makes it an excellent choice for those who struggle with heavy bags or are looking to minimize weight while traveling. Despite its feather-light build, it doesn‚Äôt compromise on sturdiness.

**Warranty**  
Travelpro backs this tote with a Limited Lifetime Coverage warranty, which includes a trusted companion promise that covers repair costs for damage caused by airlines or other common carriers for the first year. Given the abuse that luggage often endures, this is a comforting guarantee.

**Advantages**

* Incredibly lightweight, making it easy to carry for extended periods.
* Spacious interior with multiple organizational pockets.
* Fits under the seat of most airlines, saving overhead bin space.

**Drawbacks**

* Lacks metal feet at the bottom, which could help protect the base from dirt.
* Zippers, though sturdy, could feel smoother and more premium.
* Limited compartments might make organizing smaller items challenging.

**Direct Competitors**  
The Samsonite Tote-A-Ton is a close competitor to the Travelpro Maxlite 5, offering a similar lightweight build and decent capacity. However, it lacks the sleek design and weather-resistant coating that the Travelpro bag boasts. On the other hand, the AmazonBasics Underseat Luggage is a budget-friendly alternative, but it doesn‚Äôt feel as durable or comfortable to carry over long distances.

**Value for Money**  
This tote provides excellent bang for the buck, especially for frequent travelers like me who value portability and durability. While it‚Äôs not the cheapest option on the market, the quality and thoughtful design justify the price. If you‚Äôre someone who often travels light and values convenience, this bag is worth considering.

Coffee fundraising is a popular and effective way for charities, schools, and nonprofit organizations to raise money. After all, coffee is a daily staple for millions of people! However, many volunteers limit their sales to friends and family, which can cap the fundraiser‚Äôs potential.

If you‚Äôre looking to take your coffee fundraiser to the next level using the **Fundraising Zone free catalog program**, it‚Äôs time to think bigger. This guide will share creative strategies to help you move beyond your inner circle and sell in bulk, boosting your fundraising success.

# 1. Partner with Local Businesses for Employee Coffee Programs

Businesses go through a lot of coffee, especially offices, retail stores, and service centers. Approach local businesses and offer them a way to support your cause while supplying their employees with quality coffee. You can provide a simple bulk order form, making it easy for companies to support you without disrupting their daily operations. It‚Äôs a win-win: businesses get great coffee, and your fundraiser gets a major sales boost.

# 2. Sell Coffee Subscriptions for Monthly Recurring Sales

A one-time coffee sale is great‚Äîbut a recurring subscription is even better! Set up a ""Coffee of the Month"" club where supporters receive fresh coffee delivered regularly. Subscriptions mean consistent support for your fundraiser over time. Work with Fundraising Zone to offer different blends or flavors each month to keep subscribers excited.

# 3. Pitch to Churches & Places of Worship

Many churches serve coffee during social hours, events, and fellowship gatherings. Offer them a convenient way to restock their coffee supply while supporting a meaningful cause. You can also target church groups, Bible studies, and prayer meetings, encouraging them to purchase coffee in bulk for their gatherings.

# 4. Collaborate with Local Caf√©s & Restaurants

Reach out to independent coffee shops, diners, or restaurants that might be open to featuring your fundraiser coffee. Provide promotional materials highlighting the cause they‚Äôre supporting. Some businesses may even commit to purchasing your coffee wholesale, making it a long-term partnership that benefits both parties.

# 5. Bulk Orders for Schools & Teacher Lounges

Schools‚Äîespecially teacher lounges‚Äîare a great target for bulk coffee sales. Approach the PTA, school administrators, or faculty leadership to offer coffee for their lounges, events, or meetings. Consider offering a discounted bulk rate for schools that commit to regular orders, encouraging long-term support.

# 6. Set Up a ""Coffee Break"" Fundraiser at Corporate Offices

Organize a one-day coffee tasting event at a local business. Set up a coffee stand in their breakroom and offer free samples of your fundraising coffee. Employees can place bulk orders directly during the event. Leave behind order forms or QR codes so employees can continue to support your fundraiser after the event ends.

# 7. Target Gyms & Fitness Centers

Fitness enthusiasts often love a good cup of coffee before or after a workout. Work with gym owners to promote your coffee fundraiser at their front desk or through their member newsletters. You can offer special blends that appeal to health-conscious customers, like low-acid or organic coffee options.

# 8. Sell at Farmers Markets & Community Events

Setting up a booth at a local farmers‚Äô market, craft fair, or community festival can help you reach new customers. Offer free coffee samples to attract attention and encourage impulse buys. Be sure to provide QR codes or flyers for easy online bulk orders, especially for those who want to support the cause but don‚Äôt want to carry purchases home.

# 9. Partner with Real Estate Agents for Closing Gifts

Real estate agents often give gifts to clients when they close on a home. Reach out to local realtors and offer custom coffee gift packages as an easy and thoughtful closing gift. Offer bulk discount rates for agents who want to buy multiple sets at once, ensuring they‚Äôre always prepared for their next sale.

# 10. Corporate Gifting & Holiday Coffee Packages

Many businesses look for unique, meaningful gifts during the holiday season. Offer your coffee fundraiser as a corporate gifting solution‚Äîperfect for employee appreciation, client gifts, or holiday thank-you packages. Approach local banks, law firms, and other professional offices to pitch your coffee gift bundles. Offering customizable gift sets can make this an attractive option for businesses.

**Conclusion**

Selling coffee to friends and family is just the beginning. To truly maximize your fundraising potential, think bigger by targeting businesses, schools, churches, and community organizations. By using creative strategies and offering bulk order options, your organization can boost sales and raise more funds for your cause.

Don‚Äôt forget to order your [free coffee fundraising catalog from Fundraising Zone ](https://fundraisingzone.com/catalogs/coffee-fundraiser/)to get started. It‚Äôs time to brew up success and turn every cup into support for your mission!

* Proper, farm-to-table white tablecloth restaurant or cafe/deli (e.g. a [Red Hills Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zSfy7gpqBgAczWVr7) or [Chez Panisse](https://www.chezpanisse.com))
* Large gym with a swimming pool (e.g. [YMCA proposal](https://ridgefieldroundtable.org/ymca))
* More cohesive bike paths/trails connecting town and some of the more rural country roads
* Fiber internet for *both* rural and city of Ridgefield (e.g. [ToledoTel](https://wita-tel.org/toledotel-broadband-agreement-approved-winlock/)¬†in Toledo, WA where the infra is Lewis County-owned, but leased to a family-owned ISP; see also: [Co-ops are Connecting Rural America to High Speed Internet](https://qz.com/1888605/co-ops-are-connecting-rural-america-to-high-speed-internet))

‚Äúsomeone randomly sent me money

not sure if this is a scam, but someone randomly sent me money.
they sent on january 28th, ‚ÄúMiss you‚Äù. then later that day sent $5 in apple cash with ‚ÄúHave a coffee :)‚Äù.

i ignored these and never used the money in case it could be traced back to me. also, i didn‚Äôt realize my apple pay had auto-accept on so i fear i can‚Äôt just choose whether or not to.

then, today, he said ‚ÄúMiss you‚Äù, an hour or so later said ‚ÄúStill want your Amazon wishlist so I can spoil you‚Äù.

NOW i did reply and said ‚Äúi lost my contacts, who is this?‚Äù just to see if it was the name attached to the number when i looked it up in one of those real people search websites, but it wasn‚Äôt üíî

he replied ‚ÄúChris!‚Äù then ‚ÄúThe anesthesiologist‚Äù AND THEN SENT $10 IN APPLE PAYYY with ‚ÄúMore food moneysss‚Äù

NOW this guy seems creepy but i am also a broke college student. does this seem like a phishing scam? should i try and report it to apple pay and get the money out of my account just to be safe?‚Äù

I‚Äôm in a difficult stage in my life where (and I have my reasons) I‚Äôm having to live at home. I‚Äôve been home about 7 months now after having lived with an ex partner for six years. About October time I really started taking my weight loss journey seriously again as I fell off for about three months after the break up. 

Since then, my mum has been regularly commenting on my appearance. Yes, I made the mistake of not moving in silence with her. So whilst most of the comments are positive saying the weight loss is really visible. If I wear anything other than black leggings ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not flattering- you need to just wear black‚Äù. Like tonight, I am innocently making a coffee with my back turned ‚Äúdon‚Äôt wear that cardigan on a date- it makes you look five stone heavier‚Äù.

The comment tonight was really random and completely unprovoked. And it‚Äôs just made me feel like crying. I‚Äôm so proud of what I have achieved in my journey so far and still very much going. I‚Äôm fed up with her comments. She is equally as pessimistic about my dating life too. I work from home too so she‚Äôs constantly coming into the room where I‚Äôm working, talking to me. I‚Äôm just around her so much, my work is already stressful and trying to maintain a weight loss journey with all this going on is making me miserable.

I don‚Äôt really know what I‚Äôm hoping to achieve by this post but. There must be several of you that have been in a similar situation. Maybe some guiding talk would help? Who knows ",3,1740424429.0,loseit,8,1.0,False

Long story short, i have this fuck buddy, we literally trigger each other so hard that the moment we regain being in touch we both barely keep it together when meeting privately. We have a weird friendship (We added casual sex, lol). 

We usually wait for the right time to meet (Usually a bit hard due both our schedules), but when we do, we get together, drink while chatting very nicely about our work, everyday, and even diving deep into people we have crush on to have a romantic relationship while knowing we fuck. One thing leads to another (Specially with alcohol) and we do a good round of fun and back to normal.

There been times where i was too busy to meet and my buddy was desperate to fuck and chat (not necesarilly in that order lol), sending me spicy messages, even pics, and while i got very horny specially when i noticed how needy my buddy was, the more needy, the more horny i got, we coulnd't meet for several weeks. Then we finnaly meet, chatted about stuff, my buddy vented hard about the ex, we laughted a lot, drink a lot and then the fun. All good there. That was in december.

Late december we were fooling over text and my buddy had to travel, left me hanging for days and this time i got needy, since we couldn't meet i handled my own bussiness and so on. 

Weeks passed and my buddy finally had some time to answer texts and we both got busy... Then i got no answer for weeks and i just took some courage and i write again despuite being left as seen.

My buddy replies that didn't get the last message and thought i was the one ghosting... We chat a bit and we dive a bit deep about how our ""friendship"" works, telling my buddy i enjoy the talks and fun very much and so on adding that it's been a stressful couple of weeks and we could use some venting, my buddy does the same and we agreed to chat to meet soon  just to have coffee and conversation (without any specifics about the timing, just ""soon""), i make a joke about doing ""it"" despite we being clear about the ""Just chat and coffee"", and it's been another week with not a single answer.

I've had a few rought weeks filled with stress and i'd really like to vent with my buddy, but my horniness is also pilling up quite heavily and i already ""handled myself"" in many ways but i keep wanting to have the relaxing night with my buddy... So...

Any advice on how to approach this? 

Do you think my buddy is annoyed, hurt or something?

Maybe my buddy wants me to show for once how needy i am?

Thanks in advance.

1ixa78i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Artadvice/comments/1ixa78i/i_completely_lost_at_my_art_journey/,I completely lost at my art journey,"**This is a long and very** personal **story of my life. I‚Äôm seeking help from** professional **artists. Reading time 6-8 minutes.** 

Hi I‚Äôm Zey 24 yrs old illustrator. I started drawing since midschool. I‚Äôm coming from very strict and religious family and I had a traumatic childhood. My parents never care my education i was very bad at socializing and because i was a fatty child i got bullied for my entire school life. I loved reading, watching movies and playing games because i had no friend, social life and a proper family.  I spend my childhood with animation movies, anime and books. I always enjoyed drawing and dreaming to become an animator someday so i could have a chance to reach teenagers who felt the same way as me. When I was 16 my dad didnt allow me to go to school anymore because he figured out i had a boyfriend. He took my laptop and ipad and i was not allowed to leave my room for weeks. I cried and watched the walls while wishing to die. Then for a couple of months i lived with my married sister. After i went back home i was allowed to eat in the house but my father wasn‚Äòt talking to me and they stopped giving me money or buying anything for me. After a couple of months i started working in a religious pre school taking care of kids. They allowed me to work because they knew everyone from school. In that time i started to go to some free manga drawing course secretly. After a couple of months i found a job in a restaurant, my parents didnt allow me to go to work (my mom told me i‚Äòd be a whore because i was going to serve men) and locked the door of the house but i found my mom‚Äôs key and ran away. I guess they kind of gave up on me at that point and didn‚Äôt care after that day. I bought my first phone with my first salary. Then bought a laptop and started to take some professional classes for art university. In that time on a random day my father started to talk to me again after 2 years and apologized to me. Nothing changed but we were talking. By the way i was wearing a headscarf since i was 8. During that time i talked with my dad to take it off and he allowed me (i guess he felt guilty for not talking to me or basically quitting being my parent). I failed at exams of free universities for years and years because i was working at the same time and i had no one to help me with my mental issues. During the pandemic we had another big fight with my family because my sister found out my instagram account and saw me in shorts at the beach. They forced me to close all of my social media accounts in the pandemic. I fucking lost my mind. After the pandemic i was working in a coffee shop again and i started having panic attacks. After seeing a psychiatrist i learned i have adhd. Everything got more depressing and worse over the years and I completely lost faith in myself and my art. During those years me and my dad had hundreds of fights because i wore a t shirt or i came home after 11 etc. etc. 



I left my family house saying nothing and started living with my boyfriend and my friends 2 years ago. Because i was paying rent and the other expenses of living completely by myself i never had the chance to completely quit my job and focus on my art career. Since i started working at a bar in 2023 everything got worse and worse. I got an eating disorder, my anxiety got worse i was having at least 2 attacks in a week at work because i was so tired of working long hours with low salary. 10 hours a day 6 days a week. I couldn‚Äôt create anything properly for one year and attempted suicide last summer. I lost 20 kg in 3 months. After these 3 months ago i quit my job for pursuing my art career and went to Montenegro with all of my savings (2k euro max), started working on my art in a small airbnb studio. I cried every day. I tried to find clients or anything and i failed. I started volunteering at a small hostel at the beginning of this year. Right now I don‚Äôt have to pay rent but i still need money for groceries. At least for a time to build my portfolio for working in the game industry. But I completely lost in my art journey. I don‚Äôt know what i love anymore. I dont know what I can do anymore. I‚Äòm 24 years old and everything feels so impossible. I already took debt from my friends, i only have 20 euros in my account, I don‚Äòt know what to eat tomorrow. (Please don‚Äòt get me wrong I also made very nice friends in the hostel and obviously i can take debt money just for food expenses but this feels so wrong and i feel so desperate and alone day by day.) I just want to ask even after all of this how can I create? How would I know which field I must build my portfolio in? Everything feels so depressing and I cant lock in and focus on my art because of my depressive thoughts. I feel like I‚Äôm a failure. I ran away from my country but every trauma I had also came with me. I‚Äôm so afraid to try and quit everything again.

I‚Äôm struggling to focus on one field (for example environment design or child book illustration) For now i started working on my personal project for create a child book. When I done with first examples and illustrations i will add my portfolio and start cold mails to publishers. But its so hard to continue doing this now. 

Again please dont get me wrong, I dont want any likes, followers, money or etc. I just need professional advice from artists to how to begin earning money from my art without an audience. I failed at social media accounts and fiver or upwork so hard to get jobs for new artists. ",1,1740424413.0,Artadvice,0,1.0,False
1ixa70x,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/1ixa70x/from_zero_to_cissp_in_eight_days/,From Zero to CISSP in eight days ü§ì,"Hey everyone!

I figured I‚Äôd share my totally unexpected (and kinda insane) path to passing the CISSP exam. Just a heads-up: I‚Äôm from the Nordics and not a native English speaker, so please bare with my quirks (and mispells)!

I‚Äôve got about 10 years of IT experience‚Äîmilitary, finance, and working as a CISO these past few years‚Äîso I thought I had some decent background knowledge. But still, I went into this five-day CISSP bootcamp with basically no real study plan. The plan was literally: Show up, pay attention, and hope for the best.

During the bootcamp, I got my hands on a huge 700+ page PowerPoint deck. I took frantic notes on almost every slide‚Äîmy writing hand is still complaining, I swear. Then the weekend rolled around and I decided to do absolutely nothing (I regret nothing!). After that, I spent maybe three days reviewing my notes, going through some test questions from the course, and using the offcial (ISC)¬≤ app. No big, fancy textbooks for me‚Äîdidn‚Äôt even crack them open once!

Come exam day, I was convinced I‚Äôd have to tackle at least 125 questions minimum (remember my no-prepp). But somewhere around question 97, I glanced at the clock‚Äîonly 80‚Äì85 minutes had passed. I had actually just taken a quick bathroom break, because coffee and nerves are obviously a great combo (not!). I came back, answered a few more, and suddenly at question 100‚Ä¶ the test just stopped.

My heart nearly jumped outta my chest. I thought, ‚ÄúThis is it. The early cutoff. I‚Äôve totally bombed.‚Äù Then I stepped out and found out‚ÄîI‚Äôd passed! In less than 90 minutes, too. I still can‚Äôt quite belive it. Basically, I went from zero dedicated study time to a passing score in just eight days studying in total. Wild, right?

So, that‚Äôs my random CISSP success story. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs the recommended route, but hey, it worked for me. Maybe a good bootcamp, a few days of notes, and a bit of Nordic luck is all you need. Just watch out on the coffee intake or you‚Äôll end up in a bathroom dash like I did.

Anyway, hope this at least gives someone a laugh‚Äîor a little hope if you‚Äôre strapped for time. Feel free to drop any questions or just shake your head in disbelief. üòÑ",17,1740424400.0,cissp,10,0.87,False

\
Questo primo articolo analizza il design dell‚Äôhypervisor e le caratteristiche di sicurezza hardware su cui si basa, fungendo da materiale introduttivo per la seconda parte, che verr√† pubblicata la settimana successiva e conterr√† l‚Äôexploit vero e proprio.\
https://twitter.com/Grimdoomer/status/1894083213749874858\
Ryan M ha voluto chiarire alcuni punti fondamentali riguardo all‚Äôexploit. Si tratta di un exploit software per l‚Äôhypervisor che funziona sull‚Äôultima versione del software della Xbox 360 (17559).\
Tuttavia, non si tratta di un ‚Äúsoftmod‚Äù tradizionale, in quanto non √® persistente: ogni volta che la console viene riavviata, l‚Äôexploit deve essere eseguito nuovamente.\
Inoltre, la sua affidabilit√† √® piuttosto bassa, con un tasso di successo del 30% e un tempo di esecuzione che pu√≤ arrivare fino a 20 minuti.\
In pratica, ogni volta che si accende la console, si deve aspettare quasi 20 minuti affinch√© l‚Äôexploit venga eseguito, con una probabilit√† del 70% che fallisca, rendendo necessario un riavvio e un nuovo tentativo.\
Ryan M non prevede che l‚Äôexploit diventi mai persistente o pi√π affidabile. Il suo obiettivo principale √® dimostrare che un exploit software per l‚Äôhypervisor √® possibile, senza l‚Äôintenzione di renderlo uno strumento pratico per i modder.\
I file dell‚Äôexploit, che verranno rilasciati nella seconda parte del blog, consentiranno di patchare l‚Äôhypervisor per eseguire codice non firmato e avviare un singolo eseguibile non firmato come dimostrazione.\
Tuttavia, non includeranno miglioramenti come la rimozione dei controlli di firma sui pacchetti di contenuti o il supporto per eseguibili criptati per sviluppatori. Questi aspetti dovranno essere affrontati da altri sviluppatori con un eseguibile post-exploit.\
Ryan M si concentra esclusivamente sullo sfruttamento dell‚Äôhypervisor e sull‚Äôesecuzione di codice non firmato, lasciando eventuali funzionalit√† aggiuntive nelle mani della community.\

However last Saturday, my old therapist, whom I don‚Äôt have any sessions with anymore, showed up with a current client for a treat and coffee. 

I said hello and said it was good to see you. Then went back to work. I really didn‚Äôt think much of the other person with her. I thought it was family. 

Then when I took the trash out, I saw the company minivan and realized it was a session. 

I‚Äôm feeling that both of our privacy was exposed. The client is someone that lives in my apt complex, I figured out later. 

Is this an unreasonable feeling to have? Only 3-4 people know I work here and the therapist knew last year I got the job here. 

What advice is good here??  I‚Äôm thinking she forgot I work here but I know about her current client now.

I try not to be obnoxious about it and do not talk to the camera in super busy spaces.

In my country, I've never been asked to stop filming or to leave and it's legal here to film in public spaces unless it's an official government building.

So two weeks ago I was blindsided by my ex after almost 1 year together. He was planning on breaking up with a text but I caught him and made him confess the night before he was planning on doing it. Mind you, we were living together and we had to spend the whole breakup night together because I wasn‚Äôt able to drive after he broke the news. 

We had a last conversation approximately 1 week ago, where he would say that I was torturing him with so many questions (I mean‚Ä¶one wonderful year together with 0 problems and you dump me out of the blue? of course I have questions!!!) and many more hurtful things‚Ä¶He even lost his temper and shouted at me lol (He had never done that before).

He later texted me apologizing but I blocked him and deleted everything that reminded me of him from my phone. It‚Äôs been one week of no contact. I‚Äôve been trying to keep busy with work, friends, family, YouTube, reading‚Ä¶I‚Äôve even started taking Pilates classes and going for walks listening to Podcasts so I don‚Äôt overthink as much. 

I would say I am doing a bit better but nostalgia and sadness always hit me in the most unexpected moments. Suddenly, I am having a coffee at work or taking a shower at the gym and a random memory with him pops up. I would also have a lot of trouble sleeping because I could only dream about him or the breakup never happening. These past two days I‚Äôve dreamt about him, but he would tell me that it‚Äôs over or that he would never come back‚Ä¶etc. I hope that‚Äôs my subconscious accepting the breakup. Also, as I have deleted all of his pictures, videos, voice messages‚Ä¶sometimes it feels like I can‚Äôt remember his face or his voice clearly. Are these some signs that I am starting to heal?

1ix9uu0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1ix9uu0/should_i_be_concerned_about_my_little_brother_and/,Should I be 'concerned' about my little brother and his girlfriend?,"I (29M) am the legal guardian of my little brother Pete (he just turned 13). I don't want to get into a lot of details, but I'll just say neither of his parents have been able to take care of him since he was born. I've been his legal guardian since he was 7, and even though I'd call myself a pretty cool big brother, I couldn't tell you how good I am as a parent, which is why I'm here looking for advice.

About 5 months ago, a new family moved in next to us. The daughter, Theresa, is Pete's age and they quickly became friends. It wasn't long until they started calling each other boyfriend and girlfriend. I never really commented on it because they're both young and inexperienced in dating, but I can tell they really like each other. Pete never shuts up about Theresa, he's always drawing pictures of her, taking pictures with her, and she's usually hanging out with his friend group.

Two things to know about Theresa. 1. She and her family have immigrated to the U.S. from Mexico, so English is their second language. But Theresa can speak English pretty well since her mom is a Spanish teacher. And 2. Theresa is physically disabled and has to use a wheelchair. Pete doesn't seem to mind that, in fact he's even asked me to teach him weight training so he can get strong enough to carry her around with him.

The problem started yesterday when Pete and I hung out at one of his best friends' houses. I'm friends with the kid's parents, and we've all known each other since Pete and the kid met in the 1st grade. I was having coffee with the mom, Louise, and talking about a few things when she mentioned that she's been meaning to talk to me about a 'concern' she has about Pete. She asked if I knew that Pete had a girlfriend, because her son had mentioned it to her. I said yes, and she described Theresa from when she'd seen her hanging out with her son and Pete.

Louise asked if I knew Pete had 'good intentions' with Theresa. I just about choked on my coffee when she mentioned that and asked what she meant. Louise said that, as a mother, she felt concerned that because of Theresa's 'situation,' she's obviously more vulnerable and more easily 'persuaded' than other girls. I remember her using the words 'foreign' and 'crippled' when she was talking. Louise asked if I trusted my little brother that he wouldn't 'take advantage' of this girl.

I'll admit, I did get pissed and raised my voice, asking if she knew what she was talking about. Louise tried to backpedal and said she knew that Pete was a 'good boy,' but he's also a teenager now, and he's 'going through some changes.' She asked me to remember when I was 13, when I had those kinds of thoughts about girls that I liked. She then asked me if I trusted that Pete would be smart about that kind of stuff, but she said she was only thinking about 'safety' and what's best for everyone, especially Theresa.

We left on an awkward note with me just wanting to get the hell out of there before I started something. I have a history of having a temper. When we got home, I thought about it and, it's true, I was curious at his age. And I started to think she had a point. Maybe Pete is thinking about those kinds of things with Theresa. Maybe even she's thinking about it with Pete.

I decided to call my grandma last night, who's been the only 'parent' Pete and I have had since he was born. I asked her if she thinks it's time to talk to Pete about sex, and she scolded me, saying she doesn't like to mention that filth around her babies. But then she told me that if Pete is going to learn about sex, it'll be better to learn from a male perspective. I agreed, but even though I'd say I know all there is to know about it, I've never really had to explain it to anyone, especially not a 13 year old.

My question is, how do I approach Pete personally, like implying that I'm talking about him and Theresa but not mentioning her? I want to be respectful of her and her family. Also, should I confront Louise about what she mentioned about Pete and Theresa? I feel like she had good intentions, and she knows more about being a parent than me anyway. I also really don't want to talk to Theresa's parents about this, it just feels awkward to think about.",14,1740423586.0,TrueOffMyChest,17,1.0,False

I've read that even if you're able to recover your rig from a spill, you still run the risk of components failing down the line thanks to corrosion. Is there anything I can do here to minimize the risk of this happening?

1ix9mfo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ix9mfo/should_i_be_concerned_about_my_little_brothers/,Should I be 'concerned' about my little brother's behavior towards his girlfriend?,"I (29M) am the legal guardian of my little brother Pete (he just turned 13). I don't want to get into a lot of details, but I'll just say neither of his parents have been able to take care of him since he was born. I've been his legal guardian since he was 7, and even though I'd call myself a pretty cool big brother, I couldn't tell you how good I am as a parent, which is why I'm here looking for advice.

About 5 months ago, a new family moved in next to us. The daughter, Theresa, is Pete's age and they quickly became friends. It wasn't long until they started calling each other boyfriend and girlfriend. I never really commented on it because they're both young and inexperienced in dating, but I can tell they really like each other. Pete never shuts up about Theresa, he's always drawing pictures of her, taking pictures with her, and she's usually hanging out with his friend group.

Two things to know about Theresa. 1. She and her family have immigrated to the U.S. from Mexico, so English is their second language. But Theresa can speak English pretty well since her mom is a Spanish teacher. And 2. Theresa is physically disabled and has to use a wheelchair. Pete doesn't seem to mind that, in fact he's even asked me to teach him weight training so he can get strong enough to carry her around with him.

The problem started yesterday when Pete and I hung out at one of his best friends' houses. I'm friends with the kid's parents, and we've all known each other since Pete and the kid met in the 1st grade. I was having coffee with the mom, Louise, and talking about a few things when she mentioned that she's been meaning to talk to me about a 'concern' she has about Pete. She asked if I knew that Pete had a girlfriend, because her son had mentioned it to her. I said yes, and she described Theresa from when she'd seen her hanging out with her son and Pete. 

Louise asked if I knew Pete had 'good intentions' with Theresa. I just about choked on my coffee when she mentioned that and asked what she meant. Louise said that, as a mother, she felt concerned that because of Theresa's 'situation,' she's obviously more vulnerable and more easily 'persuaded' than other girls. I remember her using the words 'foreign' and 'crippled' when she was talking. Louise asked if I trusted my little brother that he wouldn't 'take advantage' of this girl.

I'll admit, I did get pissed and raised my voice, asking if she knew what she was talking about. Louise tried to backpedal and said she knew that Pete was a 'good boy,' but he's also a teenager now, and he's 'going through some changes.' She asked me to remember when I was 13, when I had those kinds of thoughts about girls that I liked. She then asked me if I trusted that Pete would be smart about that kind of stuff, but she said she was only thinking about 'safety' and what's best for everyone, especially Theresa.

We left on an awkward note with me just wanting to get the hell out of there before I started something. I have a history of having a temper. When we got home, I thought about it and, it's true, I was curious at his age. And I started to think she had a point. Maybe Pete is thinking about those kinds of things with Theresa. Maybe even she's thinking about it with Pete.

I decided to call my grandma last night, who's been the only 'parent' Pete and I have had since he was born. I asked her if she thinks it's time to talk to Pete about sex, and she scolded me, saying she doesn't like to mention that filth around her babies. But then she told me that if Pete is going to learn about sex, it'll be better to learn from a male perspective. I agreed, but even though I'd say I know all there is to know about it, I've never really had to explain it to anyone, especially not a 13 year old.

My question is, how do I approach Pete personally, like implying that I'm talking about him and Theresa but not mentioning her? I want to be respectful of her and her family. Also, should I confront Louise about what she mentioned about Pete and Theresa? I feel like she had good intentions, and she knows more about being a parent than me anyway. I also really don't want to talk to Theresa's parents about this, it just feels awkward to think about. ",1,1740423019.0,Advice,7,0.67,False

Last Rite (Folk Horror / Supernatural)

Javier returns to the town for his father's burial, but upon arriving he discovers that the community doesn't want to bury him yet. His father is still awake, talking to the neighbors as if nothing had happened. He laughs, eats, and toasts with everyone, but his skin is cold, his breath smells like damp earth, and his shadow doesn't move like everyone else's. That night, the village shamans explain the truth to him: his father died, but an ancient god has attached itself to his body. If they bury him now, that entity will be trapped in the ground and its hunger will grow until it consumes the entire village. They must perform one last ritual, one last sacrifice, to feed the entity enough to allow it to leave his father's body without consequences. Javier has to decide: offer himself or let the village choose another in his place?

The One Who Came From The River (Cosmic Terror)

Javier arrives in his village to bury his father, but his mother greets him with a forced smile and tells him that there is nothing to bury: his father is still there, more alive than ever. But something is wrong. His father avoids mirrors, his skin looks gelatinous under the light of dawn and, most disturbingly, his shadow trembles on the ground, as if something inside him is struggling to get out.

The village shamans finally reveal the truth to him: his father caught something in the river days before he died, something he shouldn't have touched. When his body was found, it was swollen, covered in mud, and had bite marks that didn't belong to any known animal. Now, the thing from the river has taken its place and needs a new body to remain among the living. Javier must escape before he becomes the next guest.

The Father's House (Domestic Horror / Paranoia)

Javier returns to the village for his father's burial. When he arrives, he finds the house exactly as he left it years ago, but something doesn't fit. His mother welcomes him with open arms, his brothers treat him as if nothing had happened, and his father... his father is there, pouring himself coffee as if death had never touched him.

The most disturbing thing is that no one seems to notice how strange the situation is. Only Javier notices how his father watches him too much, how his voice is too deep, too perfect. Soon, he discovers that no one in the house is who they say they are. Something has taken over his family‚Äôs identity, repeating scenes from his childhood in endless loops. Now, the house wants him to fit into its role, too. If he doesn‚Äôt, they‚Äôll supplant his place and forget he ever existed.

The Highway of Oblivion (Rural Horror / Dream Horror)

Javier receives the news of his father‚Äôs death and takes a night bus to his hometown. But the trip takes longer than expected. Hours, days, pass, and the road never changes. There are no detours, no signal on his cell phone. There‚Äôs just him, the other passengers, and a driver who never stops smiling.

An old woman next to him murmurs, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve already arrived, but you don‚Äôt remember.‚Äù Soon, Javier begins to see familiar faces inside the bus, people who should be dead. Among them, his father, sitting a few rows ahead. Something tells him that if he gets up to talk to him, he‚Äôll be trapped forever on that journey with no destination. The only way to escape is to remember how he really died and face it before the road swallows him up too.

The Other Mouth (Body Horror / Folk Horror)

Javier returns to his town for his father's funeral, but the coffin is empty. His mother, pale-faced, tells him that his father is still here, but not like before.

At night, Javier begins to hear his voice coming from impossible places: from the walls, from the ground, from the stagnant water in the sinks. His father speaks from inside the house. An old woman reveals the truth: his father had made a deal with a god buried in the mountain, and when he died, his body became a door for something that has not yet come out.

Javier must find a way to seal it before the face that appears in the cracks is no longer that of his father, but that of what devoured him.

Salt Bodies (Existential Horror / Fantastic Horror)

When Javier returns to the village, he discovers that his father has been buried according to an ancient tradition: covered in salt, so that he does not return. But at night, the salt begins to get wet and lose its shape.

Looking for advice when it comes to promoting a creating/fostering a higher tolerance for self play. We‚Äôre reaching a breaking point where when we try to set boundaries and tell our child that we ‚Äúhave a few things to do and can‚Äôt play with you right now‚Äù he will lose his mind. 

Yesterday it even got to the point where he can now communicate that I played with him a little bit at this time and a little bit at that time and that it wasn‚Äôt enough for him. 

Let me tell you, my wife and I play with him a lot! Minimum of an hour 1:1 parent to child playing for both me and my wife each day. 

My wife has developed a routine of him playing by himself for a while in the morning when she has her coffee and makes both of them breakfast. They usually get out for 1-3 hours each day to go to the library, YMCA, play date with other kids, grocery shopping‚Ä¶ so they stay pretty active. 

But when we‚Äôre at home, he will relentlessly ask us to play with him‚Ä¶ I understand that interactive play is amazing, important and it shows that he loves and trusts us. That‚Äôs why we DO spent a lot of 1:1 time together playing and interacting. But when we do need to get other tasks done, he gets really upset when we don‚Äôt play more. 

Maybe this is all normal‚Ä¶ and I get that it‚Äôs likely a good thing. But I don‚Äôt know what else to say other than it‚Äôs to the point where it‚Äôs a bit overwhelming. 

Other random notes. 

- He does have a reasonably large amount of toys/things to play with. 
- Minimal screen time, maybe average 30-6 mins a day. Sometimes we watch a movie together and some days there‚Äôs no screen time. 
- Do believe we did ‚Äúhelp‚Äù him too much when he was a baby and not make him struggle to learn some tasks.

-Hario v60 02
-fellow opus grinder
-fellow Stagg ekg kettle 
-zero water filter
-lotus mineral additives

I'm currently brewing a bag of beans I got at La Cabra in Brooklyn after I took their 2 hr hand brew course last weekend. Their instructions actually sort of surprised me! The lady instructing us said she never changes the temp from 202 degrees, and doesn't even really adjust the grind size or water:bean ratio too often even on varying beans. This shocked meme as I've seen so many different things on this sub. My questions rigjt now are these: how do you determine so many different variables on a new bag of beans? Like for example I have a bag of Wush Wush coming from Steady State in Carlsbad, CA.. best cup of coffee I've ever had was there. My brother in law that lives there did some recon and told me the barista does a 17:1 ratio at 210 degrees. Obviously I'll have to figure out grind setting but that's what they're doing at the store. So my next question is, with these lotus mineral additives should I just add them to my water from my zero water filter or is the best bet to buy gallons of distilled water? I'm using recipes from the lotus website but that's another question! Like which beans get the Light and Bright recipe vs the Simple and Sweet or Bright and Juicy? So many variables haha. I'm holding myself to the standard of that cup of coffee I had at steady state and just want to get consistent. 

I will say the biggest takeaway from the class I took for 2 hrs was tasting different brews and discovering why this one tastes chalky, why this one tastes watery, why this one tastes like nothing, etc ",1,1740422164.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

Insanity doesn't seem that far away anymore. I am teetering on the edge, tied down to a concrete table under a dazzling, unforgiving light. 

Insanity‚Äîlunacy‚Äîlosing-your-fucking mind starts in the brain, our synapses fizzling out one by one. I remember watching the late afternoon traffic as a child, my cheek lodged against cold glass. 

I remember being transfixed by those lights flying by. So many lights.

Now, I imagine them, deep inside the meat of my brain, each one flashing out. Insanity takes them, one by one, as my laughter‚Äì oh, I'm laughing? When did I start laughing? 

Twinkle, twinkle, little star, wherefore art thou? Where are the stars? Where is he?

Where are they? Questions flood my mind, but they dance and twirl and contort into not-questions. Shadows dance around me. Sometimes they have voices. They speak English, mixed with something raw, beautiful, and wrong. Their words twist in my throat, foreign and yet so familiar. 

I laugh again, tipping my head back, high on the light that bathes me, tickles my skin, crawls across my face, and entwines around my heart, tightening. So tight. So suffocating. I feel her‚Äîoh, so invasive, oh, so beautiful! Oh, please! Fill my veins. Drown me in her. Never let me go. 

Twinkle, twinkle, little star‚Äîstars in his eyes, their eyes, your eyes‚Ä¶

I sense my body jerking violently, blood seeping from every orifice, my head tossing side to side. I can *feel* elongated teeth ripping into me, pulling, tugging, ragging my insides from me. They're *insides*, I think, hysterically. Through half lidded eyes, the twinkling stars grow into shadows. My insides are supposed to stay *inside* me, and yet there they are, like tangled, withered ropes, caught between unforgiving teeth gnawing deeper and deeper, enough to satisfy them, and yet not kill me. But I don't scream. I laugh. 

I am his, and he is mine, and I am theirs. 

I am *special*, the voice inside my mind sings, and my lips form a scream, that becomes a laugh, that becomes a scream. I am not just a stomach, an endless feast for her stars. I am another body, another shell, another cavern for her light to drown. 

I choke on my blood-tinged giggles as the stars come closer. Eyes. Eyes that reflect light so bright, so painful, I am momentarily brought to sobriety, my head jolting, my bound wrists writhing by my sides. 

In his eyes, they remain, drowning him and drowning me, pushing me closer and closer to the edge‚Äì teetering on so many edges; the surface I lay on, my body meat to the slaughter, feeding my King who is always starving, always pulling me from the concrete floor, tracing his fingers down my naked spine, and pulling it from me. 

Inside my mind, the edge closes in on me, as he, she, they, *those* devour. 

The darkness shifts slightly, my eyes adjusting to dim candlelight, as his lips find my ear. He smells like he's always smelled. Like me; each of my rotting bodies and the fragmented static piecing me back together. His sharp exhale bleeding into a laugh is enough to send shivers through me, unwinding my thoughts, unwinding me. 

‚ÄúCan I tell you a story, Nin?‚Äù The King‚Äôs voice is soothing, moonlight dripping from every syllable, as another mouth finds my lips. She is softer, lighter, pressing kisses. 

I don't respond, unblinking, my lips stretching wider into a smile. 

He grins back, and in the orange blur of candlelight, his teeth are painted in me. 

Leaning closer, the King hangs upside down, his crown of emaciated bone falling in his eyes. ‚ÄúI don't usually like starting with ‚Äòonce upon a time‚Äô. It's so‚Ä¶ urgh, outdated, you know? But I've always liked fairytales, and, funnily enough, when I was a kid, I always wanted to be the Prince.‚Äù

‚ÄúOnce upon a time,‚Äù the words bleed from my mouth, each one cruelly pulled from my throat, globules of warm wetness running down my chin. They are my words, my *last* words, the last stars flickering out in my mind. ‚ÄúThere was a Prince who didn't understand how to love.‚Äù

The King inclined his head, curious, and yet his eyes darkened, that endless star perforating his pupils growing brighter, like the moon herself was laughing, writhing around his iris. I imagined his mind, like an infestation. His face was almost human, bearing the features of a human man. His voice was almost human. But what splintered in his skin, contorting his bones and shifting under his flesh, was my *King*. 

Every time I pull away from that thought, it slams into me, violent and unrelenting. 

When I squeeze my eyes shut to avoid those prickling starry lights, pretty eyes, ice cold fingers prick my chin, forcing me to look at him. It's another face. Another crown, this time sitting on top of short blonde curls bleeding into starlight eyes. 

‚ÄúIt's not your turn to tell a story,‚Äù The voice is softer, like a cool breeze grazing my face. His smile is the worst thing about him. It lies. He speaks through glistening white teeth, and yet he wastes no time reaching into my mouth, all the way down my throat, and ripping out my vocal cords. 

I don't scream. 

I laugh. 

‚ÄúI'll tell her.‚Äù

Her voice pricks between two males, a low, sultry murmur caught between a giggle. 

She smells like someone I used to know, tinges of perfume and scented candles and lemon candies. When she gets closer, however, the stink of rot and decay seeps into my nose and throat, soaking strands of her tangled hair suffocating me. ‚ÄúOnce upon a time,‚Äù she hummed, ‚ÄúThere was a beautiful Goddess. Her name was Nythea, and in the dawn of human civilization, she walked among us.‚Äù

The King's lips find my neck, biting down. ‚ÄúNythea was curious about us. She wanted to learn about us, so she walked among us. She worked with us. Lived with us. Slept and ate with us. She played with our children and gradually began to enjoy her life on the ground. Nythea had friends and family, people who loved her‚Äîand their children loved her!‚Äù

When a third mouth finds my skin‚Äîoh, so they're being gentle now?‚ÄîI shiver. I don't know or understand what I am feeling. 

Do I feel pain or pleasure? 

Am I falling or flying?

‚ÄúBut Nythea‚Ä¶‚Äù the third voice murmurs, ‚Äúmade one grand mistake.‚Äù

He chuckles, and the others echo him, as if they are one.

‚ÄúShe trusted humanity,‚Äù he sings. ‚ÄúShe trusted them with the bountiful knowledge that she was their Goddess‚Äîexpecting them to pray for her, lay themselves down for her, scream her name from the tops of their lungs‚Äîrejoice! For she had returned!‚Äù

‚ÄúHow na√Øve of her,‚Äù the soft voice‚Äîsoft lips‚Äîwhispers into mine. 

‚ÄúDo you want to guess what humans did to Nythea? Oh, Nina, it was terrible. Goddess? She lets out a dramatized laugh. ‚ÄúHow could you be a goddess? There is no Goddess! The sky is the sky, and the stars are the stars, and the moon is the moon!‚Äù

They dragged her to their founding tree, built on a lie‚Äîon a belief of their own making‚Äîsacrificing her to the sky, where she was chased back home, back into the gnawing darkness far above the clouds.‚Äù

Footsteps.

This time, the three are dancing around me.

‚ÄúBut she whispered,‚Äù the King‚Äôs voice bleeds her words. ‚ÄúShe whispered and waited for humans to prosper‚Äîfor them to start looking at the sky, and believing the sky, and believing in her. In her light that grew stronger, whispering into lonely minds, thoughts that were curious about her lonely crescent sitting amongst the stars. She began to find them. Followers who looked at her in awe, transfixed by her beauty and her vanity. Who gave themselves to the sky to be able to touch her light.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis town believed in her,‚Äù their voices come together, entwining, entangling around my skull. ‚ÄúBut Nythea did not want followers. Believers. Oh, no. She wanted soldiers who would follow her every order‚Äîwho would distance themselves from the light and fall in line with her. Strip away their shadows and consume themselves, allowing her to mold their bones, their flesh, their souls into her personal toys.‚Äù

They laugh, and I laugh too.

‚ÄúShe took their children, stole their outlines, the bare makings of their souls, creating royals who would serve her. Who would fall to the ground in her name, worship her language, becoming her beacons‚Äîher very first human soldiers who surrendered themselves, allowing her to shape them.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut there was a problem.‚Äù

The words splutter from my lips, already entangled, knotted with theirs.

‚ÄúThere was!‚Äù they laugh, joining in. 

‚ÄúBecause what Nythea soon realized was that she could only control a certain part of them. The human body, the terrestrial body and mind‚Äîshe could not mold into hers.‚Äù

They continue, each of their voices growing louder, like she was screaming. 

Through them. 

‚ÄúNythea did not forget what the humans did to her. She did not forget her agony and their lack of empathy. She did not forget their coldness, their narrow minds empty of curiosity. Their willingness to call her a *false* God. Oh, she could rip apart and shred and destroy parts of them, the extra parts that clung to them like a second skin. But no matter how hard she tried, Nythea could only play with the dancing bodies that appeared behind light. Their useless mimics who always came back.‚Äù

The King appears, looming over me, and Nythea‚Äôs light is all I can see.

He is hers. Her human soldier who walks among humans.

Who speaks her language.

Who I gave to her.

‚ÄúOutlines,‚Äù he whispers, the stars in his eyes burning into me, scalding me. ‚ÄúPerfect snapshots of the human mind and the human soul and the human body. Indistinguishable from the original, and when detached, tethered to Nythea‚Äôs light.‚Äù

‚ÄúRowan.‚Äù

I sob his name, sober now, sober enough to see through her light perforating him.

‚ÄúBut what if‚Ä¶‚Äù The King‚Äôs triumphant smirk splits into a grin. I glimpse parts of him I shouldn't‚Äîa threadbare tee hanging in strips of mangled material clinging to him, hair that dangles into once-human eyes, a crown the once-reluctant King didn't want.

‚ÄúWhat if she‚Äôs still reaching?‚Äù

The King‚Äôs declaration brings me to another edge once again. 

I‚Äôm standing on the edge of my childhood swimming pool. 

The memory is sweet. I can hear splashes and squeals, other children diving in, and the excited slapping of soaking footsteps running to cannon-ball. The other kids shout at me to join them, but my stomach twists and turns, just at the thought of falling into something so blue, so mesmerising and endless, I stumble back. 

I watch the slow ripples of water illuminated blue, my bare toes so close to the edge. I hated swimming as a kid. Mom wanted me to learn lessons, but after one accident in the sea, slipping into the deeper water, being dragged down by water with no ending, no bottom, an endless abyss swallowing me into the feast of the drowned, I stayed well away. 

‚ÄúWhat are you waiting for?‚Äù

There's a kid behind me impatiently tapping his feet, arms folded over his chest. I see his figure dancing in the reflection, his scowl splitting into two‚Äôs and three‚Äôs, carried by the water‚Äôs ripples. I clench my fists, my heart lodged in my throat. 

‚ÄúIt's too deep,‚Äù I whisper, taking one, and then two steps back. 

‚ÄúNo, it's really not.‚Äù I catch his eye-roll in the water, and then his sudden grin. 

It's too late to scream. I feel his hands shove into my back, and I'm falling forwards, plunging deep into the twinkling blue, slipping beneath the surface, my legs kicking, my arms flying out to try and bring myself back. But I'm falling deeper and deeper, screaming into nothing. Oblivion. 

Before a hand wraps around my wrist, and yanks me upwards. 

Up, up, up, I am flying. 

And I break the surface.

‚Ä¶

**SPLASH**. 

*‚ÄùThat was uncalled for.‚Äù

*‚ÄùWhat? You told me to wake her up!‚Äù*

*‚ÄùI didn't mean to throw a bucket of ice over her head!‚Äù*

It took me maybe half a second to realize I was soaking wet, gasping for breath, and part of me‚Äì splintered parts of me, wondered why I wasn't in my childhood pool. Ice cold water dripped from my hair and down my neck. I blinked it from my eyes, my chest aching, contorted words still twisted in my mouth that was so dry. 

They didn't let me eat. Only they ate. And ate and ate and ate. 

I couldn't remember the last time I spoke my own words, when her language didn't suffocate my tongue. The memory was vague, fleeting, dancing in the back of my mind: I was lying under her light, surrounded by the moon‚Äôs followers, basking in her words she filled me with. 

Presently, however, I was‚Ä¶ wet. I recognized my surroundings, light pink walls and minimal decoration, a ratty couch and a coffee table overflowing with paper. Two figures loomed over me, illuminated in dim light cast from a sputtering bulb, silhouettes bleeding into people with features, when I was I was so used to‚Äì

My mind jerked when one of the shadows bound forwards, and I felt the sudden sharp sting of a hand slapping my cheek. 

Reality slammed into me, and there he was, two inches from my face, wide eyes and contorted lips twisted into a snarl. 

He was thinner in the cheeks, dark blonde hair pinned into a ponytail, bruising circles under half lidded eyes. Samuel Fuller‚Äôs glare was raw and real, and painful to fully digest. I felt his fingernails slicing into my bare shoulders jerking me left to right. The moon turned him from a stranger into a friend. Now that I knew the truth, so did he. 

‚ÄúIt was *you*,‚Äù he spat in my face, his voice breaking. 

‚ÄúYou killed him, turned him into a fucking monster, and made me hate him‚Äì made me despise him‚Äìmade me hurt him!‚Äù 

He slapped me again, and I was grateful for the sting. I was no longer numb. ‚ÄúI came to see them,‚Äù he whispered, breaking down, dropping onto his knees, his head in my lap. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I came to see them! That night, I came to talk to them, and you were there.‚Äù He lifted his head, his lips curling, eyes burning, scalding my soul. 

‚ÄúYou turned me away. Made me think they hated me‚Äì when you already had your claws into them.‚Äù Sam spluttered on a sob, and I didn't move. Couldn't move. ‚ÄúYou snaked your way inside my brain and forced me to think I fucking *knew* you.‚Äù

I let him come apart, unraveling between my knees. I felt his sorrow, his pain, deep inside my bones, threatening to unwind me. 

‚ÄúWhen it was *him*.‚Äù he gritted out. 

Sam was right. 

All those memories I had of him, ones I held onto, ones I never wanted to let go, were never mine. Instead, I embodied myself inside them like a parasite. July 4th weekend, Samuel Fuller sat under the stars on a picnic blanket, watching the fireworks. 

But not with me. 

In freshman year, he grew close, and suddenly apart from the person who decided to join a frat to get more friends. 

Sam hated the idea. Hated the idea of losing one of his best friends to a group of frat bros. So, they became strangers again, only awkwardly smiling at each other in passing. But that wasn't *me*. 

Memories were precious, and for just a while, they were mine. 

They painted a fantasy, a promise from the moon herself, that, in exchange for the vessels I offered her, I could be oblivious. 

That I could live happily with my eyes closed, wearing *his* memories like skin. 

‚Äúand then you turned him‚Äì all three of them‚Äì  into fucking *devils*.‚Äù Sam whispered, his voice bleeding into a whine. 

‚ÄúSam.‚Äù another familiar voice murmured. Poppy appeared, nursing a coffee, a blanket slung over her shoulder. Poppy's eyes were a lot harder than I remembered. 

Her hair was longer, matted curls stuck to too-pale cheeks. 

‚ÄúGo easy on her.‚Äù

Sam pulled something from his belt, and I felt the ice cold steel sinking into the flesh of my forehead. ‚ÄúShe's a *devil*,‚Äù he spat. 

‚ÄúSo, why did you save her?‚Äù Poppy asked him, handing me the coffee. I took it, hesitantly, wrapping my fingers around the warmth. She ignored Sam‚Äôs gun, throwing the blanket over my shoulders. Now that I was regaining my self awareness, my eyes immediately found clumsily bordered up windows blocking out the moon‚Äôs light. 

Poppy and Sam‚Äôs living room was so painfully mundane and human, I could feel that numbness, that *nothing* rolling off of me, replaced by agony I chose to revel in. 

Sam didn't respond, but he did lower the gun, his lips twitching. 

‚ÄúYou dragged her away from the little game they like to play, and brought her here,‚Äù Poppy hummed. ‚ÄúIf you wanted her dead, you would have left her with them.‚Äù

Poppy's words struck me, pulling me from my reverie. 

‚ÄúGame?‚Äù I meant to jump up, but Poppy was quick to gently shove me back down. 

‚ÄúHey. Take it easy, all right?‚Äù she soothed, stepping back. ‚ÄúIt's been a while‚Äì and trust me, it's a lot to take in. So, just take a breath.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey were playing hide and seek with you,‚Äù Sam said, his lips curling. Poppy nudged him to shut up, but he continued, baited by his own words. ‚ÄúEvery day, the King stands in the town square with his eyes shut, and his *stomach* has to hide.‚Äù

He rolled his eyes. ‚ÄúOf course, as his ‚Äòfollowers‚Äô‚Äù‚Äîhe quoted the air with two fingers‚Äî‚Äúwe have to watch him play. And of course, cheer him on to feed his ego even more.‚Äù

Sam folded his arms, averting his gaze. ‚ÄúYou were clearly completely out of it, and King Asshole was closing in on you.‚Äù

He stuck out his lip. ‚ÄúSeriously, that piece of shit literally rigged the game in his favor, because of *course* he did.‚Äù Sam didn't look at me, intentionally glaring down at his filthy sneakers. ‚ÄúI grabbed what was left of you, and I brought you back here.‚Äù 

He sighed, relaxing slightly. ‚ÄúWhich was a stupid idea, because this is the first place they'll check when they start hunting you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting out of here before they can,‚Äù Poppy spoke up, her expression hardening. ‚ÄúThere's a supposed slip-kid helping people escape town. If we take the back roads in my car and follow them all the way to the barrier, we are home free.‚Äù

‚ÄúBarrier?‚Äù I questioned, my tongue still felt raw and wrong. 

Poppy slumped onto her sofa, crossing one leg over the other. ‚ÄúWhen Rowan Beck‚Äî‚Äù she caught herself, and I saw her jaw tighten. It was as if the moon were actively ripping his name from every mouth. I felt it too, a constant order at the back of my mind to address him as King. 

‚ÄúI mean, the King,‚Äù Poppy corrected herself. ‚ÄúWhen he accepted his crown, he also put up a barrier around the town, locking us out from the rest of the world.‚Äù Her gaze found the window, jaw clenching. 

‚ÄúWhere the sun never rises, and it's always night. Which is his perfect Kingdom.‚Äù she blinked, jerking her head, like she was shaking his influence seeping inside her mind. 

‚ÄúWhich is why we‚Äôre getting out of here.‚Äù Poppy jumped up. ‚ÄúFirst thing tomorrow, when we know the royals will be sleeping.‚Äù

I noticed Sam stiffen. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not *leaving* them,‚Äù he gritted out. He was trembling. 

She was quick to pull him into a hug, one that he leaned into. 

Poppy waited before pulling away from him. ‚ÄúThey're gone, Sam,‚Äù she whispered, grasping his shoulders. The way he stared back at her, hopeless, half lidded eyes struggling to take her in, pierced my heart. 

‚ÄúWhatever has taken over them has an ironclad grip. And I don't know about you, but when your possessed ex-boyfriend started culling people in the middle of the street‚Äîstudents, Sam. Half of our class.‚Äù 

Poppy choked on her words. ‚ÄúI knew then that he wasn't coming back. And if, by some miracle, he did? It wouldn‚Äôt be Kaz.‚Äù

Sam threw up his arms in exasperation, and I caught his shadow dance across the wall. ‚ÄúBut what if we can, I don't know, pour it out of him? The moon is inside his head, right? So, we force her out of him!‚Äù

Poppy groaned, tipping her head back. Again, I watched her shadow follow her lead. ‚ÄúThat's not how it works! The moon isn't tangible! You can't just *pour* her out!‚Äù

‚ÄúWe haven't even tried!‚Äù Sam spat back. ‚ÄúSo, you just expect me to leave? You're just going to let her fucking torture them?!‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's *not* Kaz, Sam.‚Äù Poppy said, her tone hardening. ‚ÄúIt's got his face. But it's *not* him.‚Äù 

‚ÄúIt's *his* body!‚Äù Sam shrieked. ‚ÄúShe's inside his head, and she's suffocating him!‚Äù

I was dazedly following their conversation, before it hit me. 

Instead of speaking, I stood up, my legs wobbling, my head spinning around. 

‚ÄúExcept we *can* pour the moon out of them,‚Äù I said, strangled by my own words.  

Admittedly, I had never seen the severing ritual, or knew if it even worked.

We had never succeeded in creating vessels from sacrifices, so there was never a reason to use it. 

I grabbed a moldy banana from the fruit bowl on the coffee table and a pair of scissors. Sam and Poppy both turned to me with questioning looks. 

‚ÄúI was never as good as my brother at learning the severing ritual,‚Äù I admitted. ‚ÄúBut we had to learn it as part of our path of light.‚Äù

I shook my head when Sam rolled his eyes. Even Poppy curled her lip. ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt matter. The ritual is only performed if something is wrong‚Äîeither with the sacrifice or the person conducting the ceremony.‚Äù

I slashed the banana in three places: at the top, where it was mostly brown mulch, in the middle, and at the bottom.

‚ÄúWhen I performed the assimilation ritual on them, I had to carve three different words into three different parts of their body to bind the moon inside them. The binding is done in case the vessel is still conscious and can sever her themselves.‚Äù

I pointed to the top of the banana. ‚ÄúThe arm. *Luhar*, which is considered the entrance point.‚Äù

I stabbed the middle. ‚ÄúThe palm. *Velilua*.‚Äù

Finally, I stuck the blade into the bottom. ‚ÄúAnd the heart. *Thalix*.‚Äù

I held up the banana. ‚ÄúThe severing ritual is simple. In order to release the moon from the vessel, just slice open the binding words.‚Äù I did so, cutting through the markings on the banana skin, slicing the top, middle, and bottom, and holding it upside down in front of their wide eyes. 

‚ÄúAnd.. she should be released.‚Äù I caught myself. ‚ÄúThe severing *must* be performed by the same person who performed the binding ritual. If not, the moon will think we are mocking her. So, I will be severing them.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou're serious.‚Äù Poppy spoke up through a  breath. 

‚ÄúHypothetically.‚Äù I added. ‚ÄúI've never actually seen it happen because, until your friends, we never had‚Ä¶ suitable vessels.‚Äù

The two of them just stared at me, wide eyed. Poppy looked oddly impressed, while Sam had gone red in the cheeks. Poppy released a breath after a bout of silence. 

‚ÄúSo, everything will, what, go back to normal?‚Äù she whispered, her eyes wide. 

I nodded. ‚ÄúIn theory. Severing the moon‚Äôs light also sends her back into the sky.‚Äù

When Poppy stared at me, incredulous, I remembered a class from the cult. ‚ÄúIt'll be like a reset. The moon‚Äôs influence will be drawn back, and the town will return to normal.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut everyone who died‚Äì‚Äù

I cut her off. ‚ÄúMom told me to think of the town governed by the moon, as no longer under human laws of physics. When she's gone, those laws will hopefully be restored.‚Äù I thought back to a different class. ‚ÄúAgain, it‚Äôs all hypothetical. But the moon has been a presence in our town for years. She's been trying to do this for *years*.  But she's never been successful.‚Äù

Poppy nodded slowly. ‚ÄúOkay, so what makes your roommates special?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey're out of towners.‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThe cult can only sacrifice people from out of town.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait,‚Äù Sam‚Äôs expression twisted. He slumped onto the chair arm. ‚ÄúSo, you've  known how to save them this *whole* fucking time?‚Äù

‚ÄúI just got my memories back,‚Äù I admitted. ‚ÄúI never knew I was part of my mom‚Äôs cult‚Äîor that I had a brother, that I even performed the sacrifice in the first place‚Ä¶‚Äù 

I stopped. These two didn't need my sob story, and I didn't deserve to give it. 

But Sam seemed inclined to listen.

Poppy gave a gentle nod for me to continue, and I did, choking on my words. ‚ÄúWhen I‚Ä¶ did it,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúWhen I‚Ä¶ carved their hearts from them and made the offering‚ÄîI didn't want to remember it. I didn't want to remember what I'd done to them.‚Äù I hissed out a breath, tracking Sam‚Äôs reactions. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not my place to say it, but I really did love them. I was alone, and all I had was my brother. I didn't have a choice. It was either I sacrificed three students, or my brother was next. But they felt safe. They were warm and real, like home, and for the first time in so long, I felt like I had a family.‚Äù I found myself smiling, somehow. 

Thinking of home cooked meals and spoiled board games, movie nights, and the smell of Kaz‚Äôs cooking when coming  home from class, my smile actually felt real. 

‚ÄúThey *were* my family,‚Äù I told Sam and Poppy. ‚ÄúAnd I never wanted to hurt them.‚Äù

I didn't want Sam to look at me, but he was, his eyes narrowed. I couldn't tell if he wanted to speak to me or shoot me.

I swiped at my eyes, getting to the point. ‚ÄúSo, the moon wiped my memories of my mother and brother and the cult. She‚Äîwell, she let me live my fantasy.‚Äù 

I nodded at Sam. ‚ÄúShe filled my head with memories that weren‚Äôt mine, so I could insert myself into their group and unknowingly let my mother, when the time was right‚Ä¶ to come inside our house and take what was hers. What I *gave* her.‚Äù

Sam scoffed, breaking through the uneasy silence.

‚ÄúIs this the part where we‚Äôre supposed to break down crying and forgive you?‚Äù

His words dripped with resentment.

‚ÄúLet's get several things straight,‚Äù he said, stepping too close. ‚ÄúThey're not your family, dude. You ritualistically murdered them. I don't give a fuck if you were in a cult‚Äîthat you had ‚Äòno choice.‚Äô If you had an ounce of humanity, you would have let them go.‚Äù

He stepped even closer, his breath tickling my face.

‚ÄúBut you didn‚Äôt.‚Äù Sam spat. ‚ÄúYou killed them.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey were already *dead*.‚Äù I whispered, and something in his expression cracked. ‚ÄúI offered them to the moon to save them!‚Äù 

Sam scoffed. ‚ÄúOh, because that's *better*?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's enough,‚Äù Poppy cut in. ‚ÄúOkay, look. None of that is important right now.‚Äù

I ignored her. I *did* let them go.‚Äù I laughed, and it felt *good.* 

‚ÄúRowan disarmed me, because of fucking course he did! He forced me to tell the truth. I told them about Jonas, and they tried to *help* me help my brother escape.‚Äù

The words were spilling from my mouth before I could stop them, sharp breaths that hurt my chest, that stung my eyes, taking me back to kneeling on dirt in front of the town lake, Rowan dying on my lap, his spluttering sobs, blood flowing from his lips, and the moon, already starving for him, reflecting in jagged lines tracing his pale skin. ‚ÄúThey were murdered on our doorstep by two cult members. They shot Kaz and Imogen dead, and Rowan‚Äîfatally, in the heart. I carried him to the lake, and Rowan died in my arms.‚Äù

Sam didn't speak, his jaw clenching. 

‚ÄúIs that what you want me to say?‚Äù I demanded. I was unraveling again, and I couldn't stop it. ‚ÄúThat I willingly turned them into monsters because I didn‚Äôt want to fucking lose them? Then yes. I did.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù Sam said bitterly. ‚ÄúI really needed *you* to decide their fate.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou weren't there.‚Äù I gritted out. ‚ÄúBut if you were, and you had the chance, you would too.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's not *important* right now,‚Äù Poppy snapped. ‚ÄúWhat's important is the severing ritual, or whatever it is.‚Äù she turned to me wearing a strained smile. ‚ÄúDo you really think it could work? Is it really that simple?‚Äù

No. 

No, it wasn't that simple. 

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I lied. ‚ÄúI just need to get close enough to him, and open up the binding.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood luck with that,‚Äù Sam muttered. ‚ÄúThe only people they allow into the town hall are potential sacrifices, or‚Ä¶ ‚Äú he straightened up. ‚ÄúKaz sometimes stands at the door. I don't know why.‚Äù he scratched his head. ‚ÄúIt's probably a power thing, or whatever, but I can try and talk to him.‚Äù 

His gaze found mine. ‚ÄúI'll talk to Kaz, and you get into the town hall and find Beck.‚Äù

Sam was already moving towards the hallway, grabbing his coat. 

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù he gestured to me. ‚ÄúKaz never sleeps, so he'll be standing at the doors.‚Äù

Sam yanked open the front door, turning back to Poppy. ‚ÄúStay here. Keep the door locked, and only open it when you know it's me.‚Äù

When we were alone, treading down pitch dark streets filled with overturned cars and corpses littering the concrete, I figured I‚Äôd ask Sam what had been bothering me for a while. 

‚ÄúWhy do you hate him?‚Äù I asked, stepping over the mutilated body of a woman. 

The town hall was only down the street, but we had to take it slow. 

Sam snorted, kicking a rock. ‚ÄúHe got himself kidnapped by a cult, and then turned into a devil. That boy isn't human.‚Äù

I held my breath, letting out in a sharp hiss. ‚ÄúI didn't let him see you the night you came to our door,‚Äù I spoke up, words lodged in my throat. ‚ÄúI tied him up, and he begged me to let him talk to you, but I didn't.‚Äù I tripped over my words. ‚ÄúI couldn't.‚Äù

Sam didn't speak for a while, kicking through puddles, before he turned to me.

‚ÄúHey, Nin?‚Äù

I didn't respond, keeping my gaze glued to the ground. 

‚ÄúIf, by some miracle, we do actually manage to pull this off,‚Äù he whispered, hopping over a road sign. Sam‚Äôs voice was a low murmur. I made the mistake of hoping he was maybe coming around. 

When he turned to look at me, his face eerily lit in her glow, my stomach twisted.

‚ÄúI hope you know that if you even *speak* to them‚Äì or go near them, I will fucking kill you.‚Äù He said casually. ‚ÄúDo you understand me? You're lucky I'm not stringing you up.‚Äù

I couldn't resist a spluttered laugh. 

‚ÄúOh, don't worry,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI'm *pretty* sure I'll be keeping my distance.‚Äù

I waited for his response, caught off guard when he dragged me back, pressing the two of us to a wall. The town hall was just ahead of us, and in front of us, two guards.

Neither of them were Kaz. 

Sam twisted to me, his eyes wide. ‚ÄúFollow me,‚Äù he whispered, pressing one finger against his lips, and pointing the other at the guards. ‚ÄúDo not say a fucking word.‚Äù

‚ÄúAye, aye, captain,‚Äù I muttered, biting back my words. 

I didn't realize I was subconsciously developing a Rowan Beck style attitude. 

I stayed down, as Sam dragged me towards the town hall. 

‚ÄúBow,‚Äù Sam hissed, shoving me with his elbow. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt bow, they‚Äôll kill you on sight. You need to prove your loyalty to them.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you stupid?‚Äù he spat, pulling me to my knees. ""*Bow*! Or they'll kill you!‚Äù

I recognized the guards standing post in front of the town hall doors. 

Noah and Dex. Cult members I grew up with, dressed in familiar white robes. 

With my memories intact, I knew exactly who they were. They stood on our doorstep, and murdered my roommates in cold blood. When I changed my mind, decided to save them, decided to *live* for my brother, they took away my choice. 

Maggots crept up my throat, a raw, visceral hold on my body sending me into fight or flight. 

I watched them put a bullet in Rowan‚Äôs heart, forcing me into a cruel choice; either give them up to a celestial light to save them, or lose them forever. Sam raised his head, nudging me to do the same. 

*Slowly*, his eyes told me, and I copied, lifting my head slightly. 

‚ÄúMy name is Samuel Fuller,‚Äù he spoke up. I'm an, um, a former friend of the King.‚Äù

He stood, keeping his hands behind his back. ‚ÄúI want to talk to Charlie Delacroix.‚Äù

‚ÄúConcerning what, exactly?‚Äù Noah‚Äôs head inclined, his gaze on me. ‚ÄúThe King is busy preparing for the assimilation of Nythea.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ tell him Sam is here to talk to him,‚Äù Sam said softly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an old‚Ä¶ friend.‚Äù

I expected to be killed on sight. Sam was a bad actor, and I was a runaway. But Noah and Dex nodded, turned, and disappeared inside clinical white light bathing the lobby. 

I could sense my body already trying to run. The doors were so close. 

I was *so close* to getting in there. 

‚ÄúFuck,‚Äù Sam whispered, releasing a breath. ‚ÄúWell, that was too easy.‚Äù

I risked a glance at him and he shoved me. Hard. 

‚ÄúDon't look at me. Look straight forward,‚Äù he said under his breath. ‚ÄúShe's watching.‚Äù

I did, training my eyes on the front window of the town hall. 

The window was blown through, what was left of a corpse lying limply on the ground. 

It wasn't my place to admit I had been desensitized to the horror around me, but the dead body didn't even graze my mind. 

It almost‚Ä¶ fit. 

‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ be here.‚Äù he whispered, his voice shuddering. ‚ÄúI can't talk to him.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou shouldn't hate him,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt wasn't his fault what happened to him. It was mine.‚Äù

I jumped when Sam‚Äôs head whipped around to stare at me. 

‚ÄúYes, it was,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd if I want to hate him, I will.‚Äù

I knew the resentment in his eyes, the hatred, the anger. I knew it well. But this time, unlike Rowan, I could save him. 

I expected him to yell at me, or more scathing insults. Instead, though, he just sighed, losing some of his bravado. 

‚ÄúYou really *do* think you‚Äôre the center of the universe, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù Sam averted his gaze, rolling his eyes. ‚ÄúEven in the made up fantasy which was our 'friendship', I never called you out on your selfish BS.""

I kept my gaze on the ground, conscious of the guards appearing at any moment. 

‚ÄúIt's the truth.‚Äù

He didn't move, his gaze glued to the doors leading into the town hall. 

‚ÄúBelieve it or not, Nin? You‚Äôre not the problem this time. I know‚Äîit‚Äôs hard to believe, since we all revolve around *you*. But this is between Kaz and me. I‚Äôll do the talking, and you get your ass in there and start the cutting-banana-binding‚Ä¶thingy.‚Äù

‚ÄúSevering ritual,‚Äù I corrected in a low murmur. ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù

Sam ducked his head, letting out an exasperated breath.

I didn‚Äôt technically know Samuel Fuller, but those memories still felt like mine‚Äîthe two of us sitting on his bed, talking about everything from relationships to classes. 

Even kneeling in a post-apocalyptic town governed by my possessed roommates, I still felt like I could tell this boy anything.

And I think, despite his hatred and resentment for me, Sam felt it too.

He turned to me, and for the first time, he looked like Sam again‚Äîmy friend.

‚ÄúNot that it‚Äôs *any* of your business, but before you and your cult buddies sacrificed my boyfriend and turned him into a fucking devil, I think I‚Ä¶‚Äù He heaved out a breath, throwing his head back, his gaze finding the too-dark sky. ‚ÄúYeah, I really fucked up.‚Äù

I opened my mouth to reply, when the doors to the town hall flew open.

I don‚Äôt know what I expected. 

Maybe, like in shows and movies, my freshly brainwashed roommate‚Äîconverted into royalty‚Äîwould announce his presence with bravado, guards surrounding him, or a grand display. 

But Kaz was alone. 

No guards. No spectacle. Gone was the cloak made of human flesh. 

Instead, he wore a white tee and jeans, a college letterman jacket thrown over the top. If Charlie Delacroix wanted to look like a ruler, he was failing. While Rowan oozed the role of a leader‚Äîa king‚ÄîKaz looked more reluctant, more soldier than royal. 

He‚Äôd cut his hair. Boyish. More mature. 

His crown of adorned bone sat askew atop thick blonde hair that fell over his forehead, splattered red, slick like paint over his eyes. Each cutting prong was cruel, slicing into his flesh, marking him, dried beads of blood running down his face, as if maybe at some point, he fought back, trying to rip emaciated bone from where it was forced, lodged onto his head. 

The winding trails of crimson were a reminder. 

No matter how hard he struggled, she would always *win*. 

Kaz was a scarlet King. 

I wanted to believe some parts of him were clinging on. But the longer I stared, the less human he appeared. I glimpsed stitches pushing out from his scalp, the evidence of his harrowing brainwashing, where the moon had quite literally pierced through his skull and forced him to submit. 

When he started to close the distance between us, I could see the contortions in his skin, his undulating bones courtesy of a transformation that had twisted his body.

He didn't look like a beast, or a human. While he had the characteristics of a four legged beast, an original werewolf, his body was more human, save from his twisted spine protruding through his back. 

but this was the most human he‚Äôd looked. 

That was, of course, if I didn‚Äôt stare too long at the way his body dragged itself, like a third limb of this sentient thing drowning him. Kaz dropped onto his hands and knees like an an animal. His eyes, filled‚Äîtaken over‚Äîby blinding light, regarded us with amusement, before he jumped up, slipping on a pair of Ray-Bans. 

I should have slapped myself for thinking this, since he was a literal cannibal werewolf possessed by the moon, but my roommate looked like a badass fucking king. 

He resembled exactly what you‚Äôd expect a college stoner to look like as a King. 

Charlie Delacroix carried himself like one. His slow, almost teasing strides had weight. 

‚ÄúGo,‚Äù Sam muttered, nudging me. ‚ÄúFind Beck, and knock some sense into him.‚Äù 

I jumped to my feet‚Äîor at least I tried‚Äîbefore I was forced back down, pinned to the ground by an otherworldly force, a sentient thing seeping into my bones and taking an unyielding hold. I could feel it taking control of me, body and then mind, pinning me to rough concrete. 

I tried to pull free, knowing I had a goal. 

I had to get through those doors, find the King, and perform the severing ritual.

But even that thought became obsolete in my head, my vision blurring. 

Next to me, Sam dropped to his knees, almost as if in prayer. 

Kaz‚Äôs footsteps grew playful, his shredded sneakers stopping in front of me.

He pulled off the glasses with a grin. ‚ÄúNope.‚Äù Kaz popped the P.

When I managed to lift my head, I could make out tiny slithers of moonlight spiderwebbing down his cheek and  splintering in his eyes, swimming in his pupils. He really was fucking beautiful.
