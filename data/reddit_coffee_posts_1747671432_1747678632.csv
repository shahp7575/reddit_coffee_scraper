1kqirlt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arrangedmarriage/comments/1kqirlt/thoughts_please/,Thoughts please,"Hi everyone,

I’m a 29-year-old male and was recently introduced to a distant relative’s profile (27F) through family. On paper, we seemed quite compatible — both of us have similar salaries and are professionally well-settled.

When I first reached out to her, her responses were cold and delayed. I initially assumed she might be busy with work. After a few days, she mentioned she wasn’t feeling well, so I gave her the benefit of the doubt. But even afterward, her replies continued to be late (8–10 hours later), which made me feel she wasn’t genuinely interested.

I mentioned this to my parents, but her father still seemed quite interested and encouraged us to meet in person. So, we arranged to meet at a coffee shop.

During the meeting, I felt like she wasn’t really engaged in the conversation — her body language and responses suggested disinterest. On the other hand, I liked her. Still, based on how things went, I told my parents not to pursue it further unless they heard back from her side — which hasn’t happened.

Now, a few days later, I’m still overthinking it. I can’t help but wonder: Is there something wrong with my profile? Am I not good-looking enough? Or could it be that she’s already in a relationship and just going through the motions to satisfy her parents?

This whole experience has left me feeling a bit low and confused. Any insights or advice would be appreciated.",1,1747678336.0,Arrangedmarriage,2,1.0,False

1kqipa4,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlyInDubai/comments/1kqipa4/got_my_dubai_driving_license_after_months_of/,Got my Dubai driving license after months of struggle… I’m never stepping inside an RTA branch again 😭,"Man, I don’t even know where to start. Just got my Dubai license today and I’m genuinely mentally, emotionally, and spiritually drained. Whoever said it’s just a “driving test” hasn’t tried getting licensed here as an expat.

I came to Dubai thinking my previous driving experience back home would help. Spoiler: it didn’t. The moment I enrolled, it felt less like learning how to drive and more like being tested for the Dubai Olympics. Between the theory test, internal assessments, parking, and the infamous road test, I feel like I’ve been on a full-blown spiritual journey.

The stress is unreal. One tiny mistake, one missed mirror check, or even a slightly late signal and you’re done. “Try again next time.” That phrase is now permanently tattooed on my brain.

What really gets me is how casual everyone else seems about it. I saw this guy finish his test, step out smiling, get a PASS, and walk away like he just bought groceries. Meanwhile, I’m sitting in the car with sweaty palms, replaying every turn I took and praying I didn’t forget to check a mirror at 3:05 PM.

And don’t get me started on the money and time. Bro… if I added up what I’ve spent on classes, re-tests, NOCs, transport, and coffee from waiting areas, I could’ve leased a car for a year. Or maybe bought a bike and called it a day 😂

Anyway, I passed. Finally. But I swear, the moment I saw that “Congratulations” message on the portal, I actually sat in silence for a full 10 minutes. Just… processing it. This city really doesn’t hand out licenses easy.

To everyone still grinding through RTA hell—stay strong, your day will come. And to those who passed on their first try… what sorcery did you use?

Anyone else feel like this whole process is a rite of passage in Dubai?",1,1747678187.0,OnlyInDubai,0,1.0,False

1kqimy4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1kqimy4/dark_days_chapter_16_one_down/,Dark Days - CHAPTER 16: One Down,"The second pass from the fighter’s gun run struck home.

On the drone feed, white-hot streaks of cannon fire laced through the upper curve of the shield—and this time, they got through. Cracks spidered outward, briefly stabilized, then gave way. The rounds punched into the Scryer’s mass. What followed wasn’t fire or sparks—just a sudden, terrible bloom of matter.

Pale mist. Ichor. Fragments of something soft and inside-out sprayed from exit wounds and smeared against the inner curve of the failing shield. The viscera stuck for a half-second—twitching, boiling—before sliding down the arc like blood across glass.

Then the barrier buckled. It didn’t collapse inward; it blew out. The shield flared and shattered away from the creature like a bubble bursting, spraying hot blue shards and trailing gore into open air.

The drone operator leaned forward, but no one said a word.

The Scryer convulsed—once.

There was no drift. No fall. One moment the pale mass sagged and spun with internal collapse. The next, it bent. Spasmed. And vanished—jerked downward with such force the skin at its midsection compressed inward like it had been speared by something invisible.

Without the levitation, the chain bore down—uninterrupted, unrelenting. It didn’t fall. It was claimed.

The chain didn’t follow—it led. Every link was already in motion the moment the levitation failed—driven by mass alone. It vanished with the body, whipping down into the breach.

Fragments that hadn’t been caught—strips of membrane, an eyestalk, something with cartilage—drifted in the air. They fell slowly, untouched, like the rest had never existed.

The screen froze on the aftermath. Dust settled. No heat signature remained. No energy flare. Just the flickering purple of the portal and drifting tissue dropping into the crater like shed skin.

No one gave the order. Someone just did it.

The feed scrubbed back to the instant of deformation. Frame by frame, they watched the Scryer’s body contort, then vanish. The chain’s tension was visible for exactly one frame—then gone.

A quiet conversation started between two of the analysts near the drone station.

“Zoom that frame—just before it disappears.”

“That thing wasn’t falling.”

“No. The mass was constant. The tension was constant. The thing was what gave out.”

The director said nothing.

He took a long sip of what was left in the cup. Cold. Fitting. He had five minutes left to pretend he was in control.

The portal still flickered on-screen, unchanged. Whatever that thing had been, it was gone. But the creatures weren’t.

The director spoke low. “What’s the hostile presence?”

“We’re logging new contacts every few seconds,” the analyst said. “Estimate somewhere between thirty-five hundred and four thousand so far. Two to three more showing up every second.”

He set the cup down and stepped forward. “Get me a full ground picture. I want every available drone and satellite looking for movement. What about civilian CCTV?”

An analyst spoke from across the room. “Not much, sir. Too rural. There’s a few fixed cameras in Knightstown—schools, police station, courthouse, maybe the library. Nothing outside town limits.”

He nodded once. “Fighter status?”

“Blacksnake One and Two are still airborne over Knightstown airspace,” a NORAD officer responded without looking up. “Fuel critical. They’ll have to RTB inside ten.”

“National Guard?”

A second voice answered crisply. “Two hours to first sortie, sir. Crew recall already in progress. Arming and fueling underway.”

“Observation drone?”

“We’ve got one MQ-9 Reaper over target now, sir. It was redirected from the Ohio River Valley—chemical weapons response. Fuel’s low. Two additional Reapers were launched from Springfield Air Guard at your escalation order. They’re about thirty minutes out. We’ll maintain continuous handoff coverage once they arrive.”

“Maintain orbit until handoff. No gaps.”

He paused, already calculating the curve in his head.

“They’re spreading too fast. We’ll lose visual coverage before the hour’s out. Get NGA to prioritize thermal and optical satellites—eastern Indiana. Fastest pass intervals available. And get me JSTARS or equivalent for wide-area ground movement tracking.”

He turned to the NORAD liaison. “Prep every F-16 at Fort Wayne for redeploy. Re-arm, refuel, rotate crews. Push max sortie rate. Check for Reaper availability outside Springfield. We’ll need more airframes to cover this AO.”

He scanned the board again.

“Get Apaches up over Knightstown. Cover the evac corridors.”

A voice from the logistics pit answered. “We’ve got a flight out of Shelbyville on standby. Two birds prepped, full weapons, crew on site.”

“Good. Launch them.”

“Already warming up.”

“See if we’ve got any A-10 assets within range.”

A staffer pulled a headset slightly off one ear. “Closest are in Ohio, sir. ANG detachment. Could have two in the air within the hour.”

“Make the request. If they’re flight-ready, get them moving.”

“Bring in Indiana Guard aviation. Black Hawks, Lakotas, anything that can carry a gun and stay airborne.”

“Yes, sir. Alerting Guard aviation now.”

“Loop in Civil Air Patrol. We’ll need visual confirmation on every choke point—Knightstown, Greenfield, New Castle. Even if it’s just a Piper Cub with a phone, I want eyes up.”

“Already drafting regional tasking.”

“Once the Reapers cycle back, rearm with Hellfires. I want strike capability on portal-adjacent swarms and any breakout clusters.”

“Understood.”

“Layered perimeter buys us time. Push it through.”

He turned slightly. “Get the President’s national security advisor on the line. Let them know I’ll need to brief the President directly. Soon.”

“Yes, sir.”

The room darkened fractionally as the main feed showed a static satellite image overlaid with rural town markers and evacuation corridors. He traced a fingertip across the digital map: Knightstown, Greenfield, New Castle, Rushville. Population dots in harm’s path.

An aide’s voice broke the moment. “Sir, Indiana governor is back on the secure line. So is Ohio. They want answers.”

He stared at the screen a moment longer before stepping back toward his seat.

The room didn’t breathe. For the first time in an hour, there were no new alerts, no status updates, no shouted questions. Just the flickering portal on-screen and the unspoken question: What’s next?

And then the universe answered.

The ISR operator pinged the room.

“Director, status change.”

The room stilled.

He turned toward the voice. “Clarify.”

“New activity at the portal.”

The operator glanced toward him. So did half the room.

He scanned the faces briefly. No objections.

He nodded once. “Show me.”

Onscreen, the drone’s optics tried to compensate as something sharp, small, and dark blurred through the haze just above the portal’s surface. Then another. And another.

The swarm grew—erratic shapes fanning out low and fast.

“Dozens at least… maybe more… they just keep coming.”

The feeds flickered as the creatures burst outward at impossible speed. They stayed low, skimming fields and treetops in tight, erratic arcs.

The operator’s voice cracked. “They’re dispersing. Fanning out in all directions.”

One contact veered hard west—its arc sharper than the others. The drone feed tried to follow as it dropped fast and snatched something moving across a field. Human-sized. It didn’t slow. Within seconds, the creature pivoted and shot back toward the portal, descending at speed. The feed caught a final blur of motion as it disappeared into the anomaly—its living prize thrashing in its grip.

The room stayed frozen.

Then the phones started.

A quiet ripple of movement spread along the perimeter desks as aides fielded calls, passed notes, or stared grimly at incoming updates. No shouting. No panic. Just the weight of something already in motion—and accelerating.

A FEMA liaison crossed the room, headset still in place. “Director, Indiana emergency ops is relaying multiple reports of civilians being snatched across the area. No exact numbers yet. It’s accelerating.”

The director didn’t look away from the drone feed. It shifted again—jittery image, static tearing through the frame—then caught flickers of movement. Several contacts had altered course and were now turning back toward the portal. Their movement had changed. Slower. Heavier.

“How wide is the spread?” he asked. “Any pattern to it?”

One analyst turned. “Yes, sir. The movement’s not random. Clustering around populated areas—Knightstown especially. South end’s overrun. Police are still holding a few blocks on the north side—alleyways, parking lots, evac corridors—but they’re getting cut off.”

He hesitated. “There’s also a large number of contacts at the Hoosier Youth Challenge Academy, just south of town. No visible signs of life, but the creatures are swarming the site. Thermal shows something hot inside. We can’t ID it yet.”

A second aide stepped in. “Indiana governor is requesting immediate clarification. Ohio governor too. Both want to know what the hell is happening.”

Still watching the screen, he saw another creature drop low, pluck something from a distant field, then veer back toward the portal.

“How many?”

The operator shook his head. “Too small, too fast. Dozens for sure. Maybe more.”

No one spoke.

His voice, when it came, was flat. Inevitable.

“They’re taking civilians. Get me shooters in the air. Cleared to engage on contact.”

He didn’t look up. “Keep Indiana and Ohio on the line. Advise both governors escalation is likely. Make sure their emergency teams are ready to coordinate.”

The words hit hard. No one argued.

The Situation Room didn’t settle.

Phones still rang. Quiet conversations overlapped. The main display stayed frozen on the ISR feed—the portal pulsing faintly under a cold Indiana sky, the flying shapes fanning outward like ink bleeding through paper.

The director stood unmoving, watching.

An aide stepped in. “Sir… do you want to brief the President?”

He sipped what was left of his cold coffee, eyes never leaving the screen.

“Yeah. Let’s get on with it.”

The aide waited.

He nodded and stepped back from the display.

“You’ve got the room until I return.”

“Yes, sir.”

He didn’t wait. He crossed the floor, retrieved the secured handset from the corner console, and disappeared through the secondary briefing door.

The Situation Room continued without him—quiet, methodical, fully awake.

On-screen, the drone tracked more shapes breaking off and vanishing into the dusk.

One down. But the flood was just beginning.

**Elsewhere in the Cosmos…**

There’s pressure.  
Not pain—just heat behind her sternum and a shrill hum inside her skull, like something screaming through clenched teeth. Her limbs twitch. Her vision pulses.  
Then the dark splits open, and something steps through.

The firestick shakes in my hands. The head is charred wood, hardened in the coals, tip blackened from the last hunt. The shelter’s already burning—woven branches crackling, smoke choking the roof hole. I can’t tell whose screams are louder—mine or the mammoth calf’s. Something crashes through the tall grass. Its shadow splits like antlers. I raise the point and scream as I thrust.  
The heat disappears. So does my hand. The firestick drops and vanishes into ash.  
That wasn’t me. I’ve never held that kind of spear. I’ve never smelled burning fur.

The ash coats the cave walls, sticking to wet moss and soot. The torch stinks of animal fat. It gutters every time I breathe too hard. I hold it above my head, its light wobbling over cave paint—red spirals, handprints with too many fingers. The children behind me don’t cry. I told them not to. The wall ahead splits. Not like stone—like skin tearing from pressure. A single, white eye pushes through the crack. The torch goes out.  
I don’t know what those handprints mean. I’ve never drawn them. But I remember putting mine there.  
I remember being told to watch the wall. Told it would come through.

And I fall—into river water, warm and yellow with silt. My brother surfaces ahead, laughing, holding a fish the size of a shoe. He turns to show me—then the splash behind him is too loud, too fast. Something big. I shout his name. I dive.  
The gravel on the river bottom slices my feet. A hand brushes my ankle. His hand. Then not his hand. Claws.

The river turns red. I surface and there’s an altar. Stone. Wet. Someone’s still breathing on it. The priest’s robes are slick and sticky at the hem where he stepped in the blood. The knife falls. I catch it. It’s bone—not metal—and carved with little teeth along the edge. The crowd behind me screams. The thing behind them roars louder. I run.

The knife drips blood onto bone. We use it to lash ribs together with sinew. The raft won’t hold. The wind smells like salt and rot and hot copper. The sky’s wrong—too low, the clouds dragging. We tie the last child down. I jump in. My arms ache. Something brushes my thigh—soft, slimy, too long.  
I don’t know how to build a raft out of ribs.  
I remember the child’s name.  
I remember mine, too. But I’ve never heard those words before.

Then hands catch my ankle—barbed, curved. I kick. The ocean vanishes. Now I’m falling. My foot’s caught on a stone lip. My nails rip out as I slip free. Better to fall than be dragged back. But I don’t hit rock. Something grabs.

Silence. Not mine. Theirs. Dozens of them. I lie curled at the bottom of a pit—dry leaves under my cheek. I can’t see them. I hear breathing. Not human. Rattled, hungry breathing. I open my mouth to say something. I don’t know what.

The scream comes out instead.

Now I’m small. Knees in the dirt. My fists won’t stop trembling. My mother is lying in front of me—arms limp, skin torn open like meat. Her blood pools around my feet. Her mouth is slack. Her eyes don’t blink.

“Wake up,” I say.

She doesn’t.

I grab her wrist. I shake it. The blood sticks to my hands.

“Wake up, please—wake up—wake—wake—”

Her eyes snap open.

Wind screams past. Her mouth is already open, but no sound comes out.

Her ribs are on fire.

Talons dig under her arms and clamp across her torso, curved hooks biting into muscle with every shift of the creature’s flight. One spur jabs just below her scapula—deep, grinding against bone.

She tries to breathe and it comes out a stutter. Every flap of the thing’s wings sends a jolt through her spine.

She’s moving—no, falling—no, carried. The air burns her skin. Her coat flaps like a flag caught in a hurricane. She twists. Below: gray sky mirrored in a frothing sea. Patches of it churn like hydrogen peroxide poured over a dirty wound. Islands jut like knuckles. The horizon is lost behind weather too close and too loud.

Stone cuts across it all—a bridge?—impossibly long and crooked. The surface looks burned, slick like obsidian drowned in oil. She’s seen rock. This isn’t rock. But her brain doesn’t know the word for it.

Shapes move along its length—hundreds. Maybe more. She can’t count them. Her eyes won’t hold still. Some are small, hunched, scrambling between the shadows. She’s seen those before. Killed them. A dozen? More?

But others—  
Others don’t make sense.

White balloon-things drift sideways through the air, each the size of a truck, held aloft not by wings but something worse—thick black chains anchored to the horizon behind them, stretched impossibly taut. They don’t fly upward. They glide. Sideways. Each dragging its leash through the air like it’s still connected to something vast and unseen.

Beneath them, creatures swarm the bridge in organized chaos. Towering brutes with legs like jointed pillars. Crawling masses of writhing limbs. Fliers that dive and scream, their wings flickering with unnatural light.

The ones she fought in the corn—those weren’t the tip of the spear. They were just the first spill from the bucket.

Her lungs burn with the cold—but her head's still full of heat and screaming.  
The memories don’t fade. They cling, packed behind her eyes like wet stone.

There was a man. Her man.

He had grease on his arms and calluses that never came clean. He was working on the bush hog—small, single-blade, still half-strapped in the bed of the truck. She’d asked him something—something that felt important at the time.

Then something about dinner.

He looked past her.

She never saw what he saw.

She screamed.

He ran for the cab—

—and it hit him.

The weight of it slammed him down, crushed him against the truck frame. She saw the way his leg folded. The way his head struck the tailgate.

Then it looked at her.

She ran. Up the porch steps. Into the house. Upstairs for the gun.

When she came back down, he was gone.

Now, behind her eyes, faces flicker and blur. Voices not hers. Grief that doesn’t belong to her. People she never met.

But she remembers Lloyd.

She clamps her jaw shut, breathes through her teeth, and tightens her grip on the chain.

She doesn’t know which part of her is crying.

The chain’s still wrapped around her arm. Caked with blood, but tight.

She remembers the gash—deep, jagged, leaking warmth down her elbow. She remembers the pain. The panic. The chain wrapped just tight enough to hold it closed.

Now the flesh beneath is smooth. Sealed. Not scarred. Not crusted. Just… gone.

Something shivers up her spine—not hers.  
I swing the weight once, twice. Let the cord slip on the third pass. It spins wide through the reeds and coils around the beast’s back legs—tight enough to drop it. I leap before it kicks.

Lynn moves. Slack coils in her palm. She snaps the chain forward like a whip and loops it high around the creature’s throat.

It shrieks—guttural, directionless. Wings tip. One of them snaps sideways. Air pressure folds in. They dip, spin.

She yanks again, harder.

They drop.

Her arms burn. The creature claws at the air, but its rhythm is broken.

The sea below froths.

She doesn’t know what waits beneath.

But she knows this:

She’s not going quietly. Not this time.

1kqikly,https://www.reddit.com/r/Perimenopause/comments/1kqikly/discouraged_need_to_vent/,discouraged & need to vent,"Hey all,

Just had my yearly checkup with labs done and feeling very discouraged by the test results.  I'm 46, going on 47 in a few months.

Last year, I was diagnosed with subclinical hypothyroidism.  Was put on 25 mcg levothyroxine.  It took about 2 months of further testing every few weeks (had covid in btw, not sure if that had an effect on everything) to determine I needed to up the levo dose to 50 mcg and finally, 3 months after that, got a normal thyroid lab result.

Having started on levo with the higher dose- I found that my energy came back, I stopped having random hot flashes, and felt more of my normal self.  

Fast forward through the year- a lot has changed.

My family and I bought a new house and are moving my elderly parents in to take care of them.  It's been a bit stressful with this process, but we are all excited for the new multi-generational living set up and finally my husband and I are now home owners in a very HCOL city.

I've noticed more physical changes in my body this past year.

* Increased intolerance to alcohol
* periods getting way lighter and shorter.  Was once 28-29 days, now down to 25-26 day cycle.  Once had a 5 day flow, now down to 2-3 day flow- heavy for 1 day only now.  Also, now I spot a week before I start my period.
* Developed a pesky sleep disturbance that's lasted for several months.  I don't have insomnia- but I'm awoken 2-3 times each night.  Can fall asleep again, but when I wake up in the morning, I'm feeling exhausted.
* Feeling a lot of fatigue by the afternoon and am yawning like I want to fall asleep by 6pm. My husband is from Central America and has an agricultural background & jokes that I'm on 'chicken time' since the chickens tend to go to sleep around 6 pm.
* I have low libido at times, but I try to power through it and make time to connect with my husband at least a few times a week.
* I have slight anxiety- always find myself sighing a lot- but it doesn't prevent me from living my life.

I have tried to implement several healthy habits in my life and this past year I have:

* Started weight lifting training- 5 days a week, 20 minutes a day and also try to walk 15-30 minutes a day
* Limited my coffee consumption.  I also don't immediately drink it upon waking up as I don't want my cortisol levels to shoot up in the morning.
* Upped my protein intake- eggs and spinach for breakfast, spinach and veggie salad with beans for lunch, chicken and veggies for dinner.  

So I was feeling very confident with my check-up last week and also under the assumption that the higher dose of levo was helping me too.  I get my labs back and I'm shocked to see that my cholesterol levels rose sharply and that my thyroid is bonkers now.  My TSH went from 5.7 to 3.2 in October and now it's back up to a 6.1?!

Only things I'm on are my levo 50mcg for thyroid, I take 200 mcg of D3 and take 200 mcg of magnesium glycinate.

Can anyone relate or have any input on what I should seek out?  I've messaged my doctor about what the next steps are and how I'm concerned about my thyroid and cholesterol levels, but have heard nothing back from them.  Do I work with an endo or meno specialist?

TL;DR: 

(i have used GPT to structure the text an fix the grammar)

3-year relationship ended 5 weeks ago. I’m avoidant, she’s anxious. Was going to propose before the BU. Weeks of emotional push-pull, support, intimacy, and weird post-breakup dynamics, including her getting into a rebound. Now in full no contact, trying to heal through gym, therapy, dates, and support from friends. Still emotionally heavy and confusing.

If you survive reading the wall of text I'm interested in your take on this situation. Honestly I think I just need to move on and to not stress about it too much. I need to heal and work on myself. 

---

I'm currently in first week of the NC (5 weeks after BU), 3 year relationship.

I'm trying to move on, going to the gym, working on hobbies, going out with friends, attending therapy - the usual.

But what is very odd to me, and my therapist agrees, is the post breakup situation.

To put things in a context I'm avoidant and she is anxious - i wasn't really aware of that before, but the breakup shook me so much that it was a catalyst for a lot of things. Hopefully I will manage to become more secure.

One important detail is that she broke up before her birthday during which I had planned to propose to her, I had prepared a well thought-out gift as well...


---

Post breakup situation was following:

- week 1:
We still texted and talked daily (she was receptive), we met two times in person for closure.

When we met the pattern was always the same, initially she would be cold, but would relax and become warm again leading to hugging and exchange of compliments.

Since the reason for the breakup were some real issues on my part (which I can't change overnight) we both agreed that we need to ramp down the communication.

I had a panic attack that week, during which she was on the call for 3 hours to help me calm down...

I even had a major mental breakdown, again she was there to support (in tears) me and push me to call my therapist.


---

- week 2:
To avoid triggering my anxiety and panic attacks we have ramped down to good morning/good night texts mostly.

Sometimes she would initiate some conversations, she sent me some recipes for lunch, dinner and breakfast (one of the things that I had to work on is taking better care of my health).

I managed to stabilize, kept up with daily gym, set up a new routine...

During that time she was following my daily activities via close friends Instagram stories (liking them as well)...

I forgot to mention, but I started hitting the gym pretty much day 1 of the breakup and asked her if she would like to track my progress, she said yes... So yeah... I keep sending her each morning selfies where I'm flexing - as view once photo, so she can stop checking them at any point. She did not miss opening a single selfie.


---

- week 3:
I suggested to meet again, she said she first needed to talk with her therapist and to think about it.

Everything went as usual that week, she kept checking photos, following stories on Instagram, sometimes initiating conversations...

By the end of the week (Friday) she said she wants to see me and that we can see each other after the holidays. We agreed to meet on Tuesday next week. Afterwards she even asked if we could meet during the weekend, but I decided to stick with Thursday.

I decided to buy a book on emotional attachments, when I started reading it everything started to make sense. I finished it in a day - I asked her if we could talk so I could share my thoughts about it. She said she will have to think about it, but maybe tomorrow evening (Sunday).

Sunday comes and we agree to talk 22.30, the time comes and she calls me all excited a few minutes early. I could hear her being gentle. When I started talking to her about what issues I spotted and what I wanted to change she was genuinely happy.


---

- week 4:
We meet each other and again everything was so odd. We were tense when we met, but quickly relaxed and she started to compliment me, keep eye contact etc...

We got to the topic of giving it another go and she said she wasn't sure about it and was afraid that she would just hurt me if she backed out at some point.

We agreed that current situation is unstable on both ends, it was emotionally exhausting. So I have proposed for us to go full no contact. We have talked a bit more, I said that I'm going to move on - but that what we had was genuinely good (she agreed) and that we should be open to the idea of revisiting everything at some point in future.

When we tried to go separate ways there was again some physical intimacy, long hugs, then trying to leave, then hugging again... I even got a kiss on a cheek. We took like 10 minutes to finally separate and go our ways.

We did mention the gift and she expressed the desire to receive it. Even asking to meet in person.

Next day she backtracked from the gift, saying that it might not be a good idea after all. I figured she thought I would give her the ring as well I guess? So I explained to her that I would keep the ring, but that the gift means a lot to me and that I simply wanted her to have it no strings attached. I told her to think about it until the weekend.

Soo... on Friday I learn that she is in a rebound (which she tried to hide). I kind of got pissed off, never in my life did I feel like that. Yes I know, we broke up. But it really hit me in a bad spot.

I called her, she answered. It was a very tense and emotional call. I thought she cheated on me and what not. She was a bit shook, but engaged in the conversation, explaining that it happened after the breakup (I have good reasons to trust her on that). That went on for 15 minutes. Honestly I have expected that she would hang up. Or that she would say something hurtful so I could just be angry and get over her.

During the call I said that it's probably better for us to not see each other, but that I would bring her the gift as a way for me to finish this chapter of my life. She agreed and said that she will think about our call.

That day my female friends grabbed me to go to a club, I was very tense but it did help - it was very enjoyable. That night I couldn't sleep at all, my heart was racing the whole night. Because of that I have decided to get over it as fast as possible and was at her place at 8 AM the next morning.

When I got to her door her mother answered. I was planning to just leave the gift, but in a moment of weakness I told her to ask her if she would like to take it herself - she came in pajamas almost instantly, happy to see me. I gave her the gift, but then we started talking. I told her that I think this is a mistake, but I'm not going to beg - I will move on and it's up to her at this point.

Then we started to get more intimate. Having long hugs, keeping eye contact, talking about what we had, a bit of kissing... It took us 30 minutes to finally say the goodbye.

On the way home I have realized that it's probably better to block her as well (to stop myself from being impulsive) - so I sent her a message explaining why I'm blocking her on social media.

That day female friend again grabbed me and took me on a cocktails night out with some of her friends, I was physically exhausted, but I did appreciate the company and conversations. I ended up sleeping over at her friend's place.


---

- week 5:
Hard week, but I managed to keep up with my routine, gym etc...

I even opened Tinder, just to see if I can handle going on dates, I have matched someone and agreed to meet during the weekend.

Hung out with friends again.

After that night I woke up at 4 AM (probably with some alcohol in my system), I unblocked her on social media and sent her a short message saying that I hope she is well and that I have started seeing new people. (probably shouldn't have sent it, but oh well...)

Next morning she responded as soon as she woke up (around 8 AM), then apparently looked me up on Instagram saw that she is no longer blocked, followed me and saw a story (I have a public profile..) She said she was happy to see me, and asked me if I enjoyed seeing a movie at the theater that we often went to (referencing the story on Instagram..). I wanted to be polite and said that I have enjoyed it and that I have always liked that place - she liked that message and I went back to no contact.

I went out again with some friends. One female friend seemed kinda interested, asking if I was over the breakup and what not. She is really stunning, blue eyes and red hair. We kept talking the whole evening - I don't see this leading anywhere at this point but it did make me feel better.

The next morning I posted a story with her. Of course ex saw it.

During the weekend I went out on a Tinder date. We had a walk, then sat down for a coffee. I didn't really feel physical attraction, but it was 3 hours of good quality conversation. It's nice when someone is interested in getting to know you. We felt we were not a good match.

I posted the story about the place I went to (it has a very unique atmosphere). Interestingly enough my ex saw it, and then for some unknown reason rebound guy checked it as well (we are not following each other).


---

- week 6:

This morning I went to the gym and posted a mirror selfie on story to get some affirmation. Since results were starting to become visible (6 weeks of daily gym) and I was there at 7.30 AM. Of course she saw the story as soon as she woke up.

I decided to go out for coffee tomorrow with a female friend that I have good vibes with, she agreed, soo yeah...

I dont have a lot of money, thats true. And hes spent way more on me, but i’ve given him gifts, handmade and bought that i’ve put sm time and thought into. Ever since we met, over a year ago. I’ve spent hundreds on personalized stuff for him that matches his interest. I cook for him, but he says im bad so i got demotivated and stopped for a bit, which led him to say i never do anything. I draw him stuff all the time, post him, write him long paragraphs, kiss and hug him and show him affection in every way. Yet he tells me im the worst girlfriend he could ever imsgine having, constantly compares me to his ex and tells me hes spent all his money and that he regrets dedicating his life to me and dropping everything and everyONE else. Only thing i feel fenuinelt guilty about is him spending a lot of money on me. When i get my paycheck, which is smaller than his i try to suggest paying for things, or sending him money for a coffee but he just gets insanely mad and tells me ""i dont want ur stupid money bro, just love me like a normal gf and i wont be upset anymore"". I just dont understand what im doing wrong. How am i not loving him normally. Everytime hes mad, out of absolutely nowhere, he tells me he ought to cut me off soon, threatens blocking me and never talking to me again. He then says, ""guess im stuck with you anyway or you’d go and harrass my whole family"" when i’ve never shown any signs of being capable of doing this at all, me and his family have a great bond and me and his sister is like best friends and talk almost everyday. Im just so sad and confused. When i get down when he yells at me he just asks me ""and whos fault is that?"". And continues to tell me how i ruined today too, how i ruin every single day when all i do is walk on eggshells and try to do everything in my power to never upset him and do everything he expects of me. No matter what i do he finds something wrong, is it just that he doesn’t love me anymore? Or am i truly just delusional and cant see what im doing? ",1,1747677699.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

I was at a coffee shop downtown and I’d always heard about my friends seeing Anthony Fantano but it had never happened to me. I walk into the coffee shop and there he is at the counter and it’s only really us in there and a couple people working at the tables. He’s really close to the barista and I can’t see her face but I assume they’re just having a friendly chat so I walk up to him and wait to say hello and when I do I get in ear shot of what hes saying.

“You always fuck yo my coffee. I ask for such simple things and subject me to your negligence.”

Then he says really high pitched.

“SUBJECT ME TO IT.”

When he turns im right there in his face because I was waiting to talk to him and i am shocked so all i can get out is a “Hey Anthony”

He grabs me by the back of the neck and stares into my eyes and gets nose to nose with me and does this horrible angry through the teeth whisper.

“DONT CALL ME ANTHONY. WE DONT KNOW EACHOTHER.”

Then he pushes passed me and out the door. The whole experience really fucked up my day and I guess I’m just not a fan anymore. Sucks.",2,1747677672.0,copypasta,0,1.0,False

I wanted to get some opinions, pros cons, and I have been doing research into the butler service. It seems pretty nifty that they can taxi you around in a golf cart, reserve spots at the pools, setup a dinner on the beach, set other things up in your room, deliver coffee/drinks whenever. I also know they can make reservations and Im sure some suggestions for you as well on excursions. But just wanted some opinions on if the price is worth it, if club level rooms are better, or even suite level rooms? Idk much about room service either, so would appreciate some insight on that as well. Money isn’t necessarily an issue, though obviously everyone likes saving money.

This is going to be long, and I honestly don’t know if I did the right thing.. I’ve rewritten this post many times, not sure what I’m even asking.. judgment, absolution, advice. I don’t even know. So here’s what happened.

I (38 m) used to be close with this guy I’ll call Jake (34 m). We were friends for ages. He was like a younger brother to me. We met in our early 20s and instantly bonded. We played music together., weekly barbecues, camping trips, late night mtb rides, conversations about everything from psychedelics to the philosophy of science.  He used to be mellow, idealistic, a little spacey. He was always a bit eccentric. Always “off the grid” mentally  
Voted for the Green Party and told everyone it was about conscious objection

He fell for Marisol  (30F) fast. like, really fast. I remember the first night he brought her to a group hangout. None of us knew what to expect. Jake had a history of intense short lived relationships. But Marisol? She just fit. She was kind of loud and very flashy but she was observant and grounded and warm. An outsider who became “one of us” almost instantly.  we quickly grew to genuinely care about her. Not just as Jake’s girlfriend, but as her own person. They moved in together right away. They Had their daughter,  Sofia not long after. For a while it was great. . Domestic bliss. We formed a little communIty of friends. Jake mellowed. .  
Then everything shifted.

It started slow. Podcasts, youtube channels, memes, It ramped up fast during the pandemic. he got really into anti vax stuff, quit his long time job because he wouldnt wear a mask (as a fulltime chef.) He started talking about “the war on masculinity“

Jake started falling into the conspiracy hole. At first it was quirky kind of stuff.  quickly it became full on COVID denial, long anngry anti vax rants, the white male victimhood, tge full on manosphere wrap. At first we didn’t take it seriously. He was always a little “out there.” But his views quickly got louder and alarmingly hostile. Therapy became “mind control” Feminism was “cultural decay”. ” Boys are being groomed to become women.”  If we challenged him, he’d call us sheep and lib-tards .  That’s when the stories started

Marisol started quietly confiding in some of us. She never trashed him, she was careful, and measured. Said she was worried about his anger. The things he’d say to her and Sofia (then 5) when upset, how he’d twist benign arguments into full on political manifestos . She told me once, He doesn’t think he’s yelling at us, he thinks he’s teaching us something .. She was scared.

But we didn’t believe her.

At first,we were the ones defending him. “He’s just stressed” “He’s always been intense” “She doesn’t get how he is“ we even went as far as saying “She’s a pathological liar” So when he told us, no, guys she was the one manipulating HIM. That she never respected HIM as a man. and she was lying, turning Sofia and his whole family against him.  We believed him. Because he was OUR friend. Because we thought we knew him. But the lies started to show.

He tole us Marisol tried to take Sofia away for no reason.But we found out she only asked for supervised visits after Jake refused therapy, screamed at her in front of their daughter, after buying a 357 magnum leaving it loaded on a coffee table and then blamed her for being too emotional.

but still   We thought she was lying, and now it breaks me to know that she was telling the truth. Quietly. Gently. While we played defense for a man who was quickly slipping into delusion and illusion .  The more we saw, the less it lined up. She was patient. Protective. Kind. And tired. So tired. She never badmouthed him, she just asked if we could help. Then showed us things. Messages. Recordings. Voicemails that didn’t match what he told us. And slowly, sickeningly, we realized he was lying. Or maybe worse, he believed it all was true. In his head, she was the unstable one. She was the liar.

One by one, our friend group started falling off. Quietly blocking him, or confronting him, or just ghosting. But I held out. I thought maybe I was his last tether to reality. That if I left he’d snap for good. That if anyone could get through, maybe it was me. so I stayed. Not because I believed him anymore, but because I thought I could be the bridge. The last friend who could talk sense into him. The person who reminded him who he used to be, But it just got darker.

They broke up. She moved in with her family and got full custody right away, with supervised visitation.After that, Jake unraveled. Some tried to intervene. He accused everyone of betrayal. Said we were all “blue pilled” and weak.. I didn’t ghost him cold. I just slowly… stopped. No more visits. No more calls. I let the bridge rot. Since then I’ve felt this gnawing guilt. Not just for laving, but for having doubted Marisol. For letting my loyalty to Jake blind me to what was in front of me.  She wasn’t keeping Sofia from him. He was skipping court dates. He was threatening her. He was tracking her phone and screaming at her in front of Sofia

He started cycling through women. young,, often preaching traditional values while clearly being exploited. He isolated himself. Posted online about how modern mothers were destroying the family. Called Marisol a liar and a hypocrite.

But I can’t stop wondering . . Did I abandon a drowning man? Or did I finally step away from someone who was dragging everyone under with him?   Because what if that was the moment he needed someone the most ? What if I was the last one holding the rope, and I let go? What if the version of him I knew was still in there, buried under all that rage and fear and false bravado?

So Reddit, AITA? For cutting off my best friend, knowing he would see it as ultimate betrayal?Was there more I could’ve done? Or was I just the last one to admit what everyone else already knew? And here’s the worst part: I was loyal. I stayed longer than anyone. I defended him when I shouldn’t have. I doubted Marisol when I should have listened. I let my history with him blind me to the man he was becoming. so finally I couldn’t keep watching him burn every bridge and call it freedom. I haven’t heard from him since. He still posts online. Wild incoherent rants about sovereign fatherhood, false rape accusations and “feminist rhetoric”.  He doesn’t mention Sofia anymore. Not even on her birthday.

I don’t know if I made the right choice walking away. Part of me still wonders if there was something more I could’ve done. something earlier, something louder.  at some point, I had to protect myself, and the people he kept hurting.

So… AITA for giving up on someone I once called a brother?",2,1747677578.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

One alternative is to swap the refrigerator and the stove, to replace the pantry on the top with space for the double wall ovens.

A bit about me - moved to US in 2016 for masters, been in different cities in US since then. I have never liked it over here, I have never been able to connect with the people here, or the culture or the hype of the cities. I have always been social and loved to be surrounded by family and friends. I always wanted to earn enough and move back to India but every time I went to analysis paralysis situation. Here are few thoughs/issues:

  
1. I have saved enough and invested enough that even with a less paying job in India, I can survive nicely and have a good life. I am not worried at all about the financial aspect, I believe it will be better for me because I can live an even better life with so many facilities and nice food options.

2. I am gay, even though US is very open, but anyone else who is an Indian gay would understand the amount of racism there is present here in the gay community. The prospects of a gay guy finding someone is very low in general but being an Indian gay in US is even tougher. I feel there might be some issues on this front in India but those will be balanced by other things like more social and accepting gay community. Would love to hear thoughts from someone who is in the same boat.

3. This might be the biggest one - I love nature and peaceful space, I know this can be challenging in a big city as there is a lot of chaos and bad infrastcuture, I love sitting in the sun in an outdoor cafe and having my coffee. I feel this would be the toughest part. I also have a dog and I am very much worried about his life, he loves his walks and so do I and I feel in India it might be tough. 

Would love to brainstorm or talk about these things with someone to help me make a stronger decision. TIA!",2,1747677460.0,returnToIndia,1,1.0,False

Every once in a blue moon (maybe once a month), I will decide to just get donuts for breakfast. However, I just buy a single donut. I bring it home, make my cup of coffee and enjoy my one donut with a cup of coffee.

Am I a weirdo for only eating a single donut?

It's not that I wouldn't like to eat more than one donut, it's just that every time I do that, I regret it like 10 minutes later.

It's true that a single donut with a cup of coffee isn't that filling of a breakfast, but I'm not that bothered by it. To me it's similar to having a muffin with coffee. Most people probably don't eat two muffins with their cup of coffee as a breakfast idea.

Tiktok changes lives for influencers who otherwise would be just like us and that may breed some jealousy, but for the **non-problematic** influencers (those who arent using their platforms to spread negativity) like halley kate, jaz, bran (sometimes), etc. while they are annoying people, i can appreciate ppl like them who come from humble backgrounds and were able to escape the rat race of life - i would love to do the same.

Halley kate owning a hamptons house at 23 after paying off $100K+ in student loan debt isnt the reason federal minimum wage hasnt risen in 15 years. Jaz isn't going to end homelessness by not upgrading her ring. There are a lot of people with a lot more money and power who can (and actually should) be doing things to help the greater good - instead they are actively destroying it.

Dear \[agent name\],

25-year-old Alyssa is a dedicated software engineer trying to get over a breakup by running on Chicago’s lakefront trail every morning. Struggling to balance her busy work schedule and show up for her friends without missing an episode of *The Real Housewives*, she puts her love life on the back burner until she meets Breanna during one of her workouts. Breanna is a fierce, stunning 28-year-old graphic designer from the suburbs, and as they get to know each other over coffee, Alyssa realizes she might be ready to give love another chance. 

They fall in love fast—and even commit to running a half marathon together—but while they’re at happy hour one night, Alyssa’s phone buzzes: It’s her ex, and she wants to meet up next week. Will Alyssa choose to reignite an old flame (better the devil you know…), or will her budding romance with Breanna reach the finish line? As Alyssa clashes with Breanna over training plans and finding work/life balance, she wants to prove she’s moved on and ready to make their relationship work, but she has to admit that something about her ex keeps her coming back and yearning for closure. 

*Running Into You* is a sweet and sexy sapphic romance of 55,000 words set in the northwest neighborhoods of contemporary Chicago. Inspired by the Chicago running community and the electric feeling of meeting people in real life, this novel will appeal to fans of Casey McQuiston’s *One Last Stop* and Becca Grischow’s *I’ll Get Back to You*.

1kqi4t2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SameGrassButGreener/comments/1kqi4t2/considering_moving_from_nyc_to_denver/,Considering moving from NYC to Denver,"Recently me and my partner are considering the possibility of moving from NYC to Denver.

We are in our late 20s and early 30s, childless and both grew up in a decent sized city, as well as living in cities our entire life. We have lived in nyc for about 6-10 years and really enjoyed the convenience, abundance of of food and entertainment, vibrant communities, and how multi-cultured it is.

However, two things that have been bugging us the longer we stay here -

First is the lack of outdoors. We both love climbing, backpacking, and skiing (xc, downhill), and while there are catskills and gunks (2+ hour drive), the mountains just feel...meh at best, even if we drive further to NH or VT. We have been doing annual trips out west, and every time we were reminded how beautiful and majestic the mountains truly are. It's also extremely humid a lot of times in nyc to do stuff when the weather is kinda nice. On top of that, the winter here has gotten worse over the past few years, some years it was so warm that there was barely any snow to go skiing.

Second is the lack of community/difficulty of making friends that are likeminded. Maybe because we live in Manhattan but not Brooklyn. There are so many options in the city, which is a good and a bad thing. What we have experienced is that though it's possible to find friends to go outdoors with, it's hard to find consistent friends and most of the relationships feel rather transient. Being outdoors, in the nature, to us is a passion, but for most of the people in the city, it is an option, the same as they also can choose to go to a nice brunch or a bar.

So we have been thinking about whether we want to move somewhere else. Due to us both growing up and living our life in big-ish cities, we still want to stay in a decent size city. We know that nothing can ever compare to nyc so we are not having that expectation. Being somewhat walkable is a must though we are willing to sacrifice it a little for the outdoors. Having good public transportation is ideal, though if there is good infrastructure for biking, we are ok with that too. COL is not really an issue since everywhere else we go would be cheaper than nyc. We both work remotely so job is not an issue. Having somewhat of a nice weather is necessary since I recently discovered that I get very depressed when it's non-stop overcast or rain or high humidity, though we are ok with dry heat, cold and snow. We would prefer the city to be diverse, but it is more important for us to have open-minded people that share the same passion and value than just skin color. We still enjoy going out to town and have a nice relaxing weekend in the city here and there. To some degree I would say we enjoy spending as much time in the city as outdoors.

This brings us to Denver. Good access to outdoors with a little drive, and cool outdoor community. It seems like a hippy (enough) and vibrant city with good enough food, brewery, coffee shops and entertainment. Friend told me that they made more friends in one year since moving to Denver than they did in 5 year when living in nyc as an outdoorsy person which gives me hope. We've heard about the bad traffic, but it's not like the traffic getting out of nyc on a friday afternoon is any better...

Any thoughts or suggestions? Am I looking for a unicorn here? I am hopeful, but also a little worried that I'm romanticizing Denver by idealizing that this could be everything that I wish I could get but can't get in nyc. We are visiting Denver in a week to ""test run"" it for a few weeks while working there, and I am getting cold feet by thinking ""maybe nyc is not that bad"". I want to make sure I go in this trip with the right kind of expectation.

fwiw, since I am a chronic over thinker, here are some other places we have looked into on the west side of the states but decided to pass for now:

\- SF, checks a lot of boxes but not sure we like the vibe there this past few years

\- Portland or Seattle, strong contenders until we discovered I react REALLY badly to overcast or rainy weather

\- Boulder, better outdoors but it's too small for us.

\- SLC, the city life really doesn't look too good...

If we stay in the city, we'd probably just move from Manhattan to Brooklyn (love the hippy and casual vibe in Boerum hill etc), we might find more friends, but it still doesn't solve the outdoor desire (and is actually worse to get out).",1,1747676894.0,SameGrassButGreener,3,1.0,False

Hey, r/SocialMediaMarketing!
Real talk: how many more Reels are you going to churn out just to get 15 views and a pity like from your mom? If you’re blaming “bad algorithms” or “wrong hashtags,” I’ve got bad news: your SMM strategy is a dumpster fire. I’m Yadviga, an SMM sorceress who turns “cute little accounts” into client-generating machines. Today, I’m breaking down the 5 mistakes killing your business in 2025 and how to fix them. Too lazy to do it yourself? DM me—I only work with people ready for real results.
🎯1. Content Without a Purpose
Filming Reels because “everyone’s doing it”? Congrats, you’re wasting your life. Instagram and TikTok algorithms in 2025 reward content that solves problems or hits emotions. Your “inspirational quote” post? Nobody cares.
Fix: Hit your audience’s pain points. Selling coffee? Make a Reel about “3 mistakes when choosing beans that make your latte taste like regret.” I did this for a client, and their reach spiked 200% in a month.
🎯2. TikTok SEO? Are You Stuck in 2020?
As mentioned in [link to the thread post], TikTok SEO in 2025 isn’t just #business. It’s keywords that rocket you to the top of search. Still using #success? Yawn.
Fix: Dig into TikTok Analytics for trending queries. I got a local bakery to rank top for “custom cakes” in 3 weeks.
🎯3. Your Reels Scream “Buy My Stuff”
If your content looks like a 2000s infomercial, users bolt faster than from Game of Thrones spoilers. Authenticity is king.
Fix: Use storytelling. Show how your product solved a client’s problem. My Reels for a fitness studio hit 10k views without a single “call now.”
🎯4. You Don’t Know Your Audience
Making Reels for “everyone”? Then they’re for no one. Without knowing your target audience, you’re just shouting into the void.
Fix: Build an audience persona and test content. I ran A/B tests for a client and boosted their CTR by 35%.
🎯5. No Funnel, No Money
Reels without a sales funnel are like a car with no gas. Likes don’t pay bills.
Fix: Create a path: Reels → bio CTA → landing page/DM. My funnels pay off for clients in 10–14 days.
Who Am I? 😇
I’m Yadviga, and for the past 7 years, I’ve been helping businesses make bank through social media. From coffee shops to SaaS, my clients see 30–60% lead growth in 3 months. Want case studies or a free account audit? DM me, but hurry—I only take 2 new clients a month.
Your Move
Fix one of these mistakes and share your results in the comments. Or spill your worst SMM fail—I’ll dissect where you screwed up. Want your socials to make money, not just likes? Hit me up.
P.S. Think your Reels are “good enough”? Keep dreaming, but don’t cry when a competitor with a funnel steals your clients.",1,1747676666.0,SocialMediaMarketing,0,1.0,False

The reason we haven't actually gotten married yet is because we don't want a huge extravagant wedding while still feeling special to us. We just want something intimate with our closest friends and family. Now, we keep going back and forth on two separate ideas and I want some insight on the logistics.

1. We have an elopement just to ourselves. We have a friend who is a wedding photographer/ videographer that caprurea the entire day. We get coffee and brunch in the morning. We get married at a special location near us, get lunch at a small diner (where we had our first date), and go to our local piano bar (where we have gone multiple times before and have requested to sing our special song). Maybe we do other activities as well (your suggestions are appreciated). We then announce that we have gotten married and then do a reception at a later date with our entire family and friends. Where we watch the video of our wedding on a projector. My problem with this idea is that I want to spend the whole day with just my fiance, but I also want my dad, grandma, aunt, brother, and closest friend to be there, watch our elopement, and help me get ready in the morning. Another thing,  we don't want it to feel just like a photo shoot all day. Yes we want photos of the day, but we don't solely want to think about posing for said photos.

2. We have a small wedding, maybe 20 to 30 people max. We get married at a local park. Afterwards, we have a reception at a restaurant my friend owns. We have a family style sit down dinner, have speeches, and socialize. Then, we go to the local piano bar that is down the street for an after party. We have our first dance there. And party the rest of the night with our closest friends and family. The problem with this is that I don't want it to cost an arm and a leg to do this. Also, we want to spend our entire day together, not apart. I feel like we won't see each other until the ceremony snd then we will be spending the rest of it with friends and family.I also don't know about the logistics of this.

I posted this into a PCOS group first and since it got quite popular and many women found the advice useful, I thought I'd post here too in case it helps someone. Just wanted to share what worked for me because I’ve been the one scrolling through Reddit posts for months looking for *anything* that could help with PCOS weight loss. I promised myself if I ever made real progress, I’d post too. So here I am 🙃

Just to be real with you – this is a very *streamlined* version of my weight loss story. In reality, there were a lot of ups and downs, trial and error, random crying, and way too many hours spent researching.

I don’t want to make it sound like it was as easy as: “just eat healthy, take a few supplements, and work out.” It wasn’t. It took time to figure out what worked for *my* body.

I also weighed myself every single day. I know some people say not to because of things like periods, water retention, etc. – and that’s true – but it helped me spot patterns. Like if I changed something in my meals (say, my lunch), and then I didn’t lose a single gram for 4 days (and I wasn’t on my period), I’d take that as a sign and tweak it again. Most of my progress came from noticing small things like that and adjusting as I went. So you have to find works for YOU. Because maybe the reason why I wasn't losing weight was insulin resistance, but for you it may be too much testosterone and that may require slightly different approach.

# Quick backstory:

I’ve always been working out 6x a week, eating semi-healthy – but I still had this stubborn belly fat that just wouldn’t go away. I’m 5'8"", and for a long time I hovered around 155lbs. I never felt like I was “overweight,” but I *never* felt comfortable in my body either. 

I'm 26 years old and weight loss has always been *really* hard for me. Like I had to try 10x harder than my friends to lose 2lbs and it honestly just made me feel broken sometimes. But in February I set a goal: lose 22lbs before summer. And I did it – took 3 months, and I didn’t starve or do anything crazy.

Here’s what helped me:

# 1. Diet – the biggest game-changer

* I tried low carb at first. Lasted maybe 2 weeks. I was miserable and didn't lose anything. So I switched to **low GI** – basically eating carbs that don't spike your blood sugar like crazy (e.g. wholgrain seeded bread instead of white bread)
* I still ate carbs with every meal, just made smarter choices and watched the portion size. I wasn’t eating 3 slices of white bread at dinner or anything.
* I tried to include as much protein as possible but it was likely only around 70g of protein per day
* I also started walking for 10 mins after every meal. Nothing fancy – I just walked around my room or my flat. I read it helps with insulin sensitivity, and it really did.

One of the biggest things I learned is that with PCOS, it’s *not* just about calories. It’s also about **insulin resistance, cortisol levels, and hormones** – all of which can make weight loss a lot more complicated. I had to stop fighting my body and start working *with* it.

A lot of women with PCOS say they’re in a calorie deficit but still not losing weight – and honestly, I get it. I was there too. If you're eating in a deficit but still having lots of **high glycemic index (GI) foods** like white bread, pasta, rice, rice cakes, or even high GI fruits like watermelon or pineapple, your blood sugar is probably spiking multiple times a day. That leads to fat storage, especially around the belly, which is super common in PCOS.

So yeah – calories matter, but *what* you eat matters just as much. The goal is to keep glucose spikes low by choosing lower GI foods and adding supplements that support insulin sensitivity. Once I figured that out, things finally started to shift for me.

# 2. Calories

I didn’t track super strictly, but I tried to stay around 1300-1400 kcal/day. I know that sounds low, but I have a slow metabolism and a sedentary job (sit at a desk all day). You might not need to go that low – I just did what worked for me. Also I want to mention I DID NOT starve or felt hungry most of the time (maybe just before bed) that's why I also kept the calories on this level. If I were hungry, I'd eat more.

# 3. Example Meals

**Breakfast:**

* 350g strawberries
* 150g high-protein yoghurt (from Lidl)
* Some granola + mix of seeds (pick healthy granola)

**Dinner ideas:**

* Quesadilla with chicken, cheese, veggies
* Or low GI bread with cottage cheese,goat’s cheese + some salad

Lunch varied a lot

I still ate things like chocolate a couple of times a week as a snack + had pizza and pasta about 6 times in those 3 months so not every day was perfect. I used to eat pasta with cheese and veggies before every day and thought I was eating healthy but unfortunately, pasta is really high in calories and simple carbs so I think it's necessary to mostly cut it (even though I love pasta)

# 4. Exercise

* I worked out 6x a week, 30 mins a day. Nothing extreme – some light weights (8kg dumbbells), bodyweight exercises, and cardio workouts (from pamela reif on youtube)
* I also aimed for around 8k steps a day
* I ran a bit too but read it can spike your cortisol so not sure if this was good

# 5. Supplements

I know not everyone is into supplements, but I researched a lot and picked supplements that actually help with PCOS (based on studies, not TikTok). I got all the supplements from Amazon

* **PCOS Care** \- It has Myo-Inositol, NAC, Maca, Chromium, Cinnamon Extract, Zinc, Vitamin D3, and Folate – all in one, less supplements to buy and take so definitely recommend
* **Berberine:** 1 capsule before meals – helped with insulin, non negotiable
* **L-Carnitine:** 2g before workouts
* **Green Tea Extract:** optional, but I liked it
* **Magnesium** 1h before bed
* Used to take **Ashwagandha** for cortisol but dropped it – just too many pills for me
* I heard amazing things about Spearmint tea but I just really don't like tea so I didn't drink it but I recommend drinking spearmint tea if you can take it
* I think having one cup of coffee a day also helped me speed up my metabolism slightly

The combo of the right diet + supplements made everything start working.

This morning I grabbed iced green tea at a different shop and it also tastes like lemon and something else rather than like plain tea.  Are they replacing their iced green tea with something else?

She seemed relaxed around me, and I didn’t feel like I had to act different.

Now I can’t stop thinking about how to ask her out without making things awkward. It’s 2025, and everyone’s either super chill or super anxious about directness, so I don’t know what’s actually the right move anymore. I don’t wanna come off too strong, but I also don’t wanna miss the window. Should I just casually suggest getting coffee or is that too boring now? Do people still go for that or is it all just “let’s hang” and hope they get the hint?

Back when I first bought this coffee, I was having the most difficult time dialing it in, either getting something too ferment-y and boozy in the taste (finer grind) or too water-y in the body (coarser grind). I gave up and the last 60 grams or so sat in my cupboard until today.

I cracked open the bag to find that it had very little to no ""stale coffee"" smell, and was still quite aromatic. Out of curiosity, I brewed it up (Timemore B75, Kalita 155 Filters, 15:1 and 5 pour recipe since that was the closest I got to dialing it in back in the day) and have ended up with quite a decent cup. It has some funk without being boozy, good aromatics, and a satisfying body. Despite its age, there is still a pretty good acidity! I undoubtedly enjoy this coffee more than when it was 2 weeks off roast.

Have others found extreme rest times on more heavily processed coffees like this to be appropriate? I am also a fan of Pu'er tea and in that community, there is a sentiment that if you don't like a tea, stow it away and try it again in a year while it ages. While coffee has a massively shorter lifespan and most of it is best in the first month or two off roast, I wonder if specialty drinkers would benefit from a similar mentality for crazier beans.",2,1747676535.0,pourover,1,1.0,False

Issue lies in me. I was infatuated with her before the affair happened. I would've done anything for her no questions asked. I loved her beyond reason (I guess that's why I stayed through this hell). Ive noticed that since getting to a place of complacency i can only love her now as a friend. I dont desire to be close to her, nor really trust her. Ive accepted the fact that she can and may cheat again. I dont make any effort for her anymore aside from making her coffee a few x a week. 
I stopped getting her little ""im thinking of you"" gifts or giving her random acts of affection like rubbing her back or hair. I just dont care. 
I dont know if this ever comes back. I dont know if I want it to. Im still very much protecting myself and I feel it just beneath the surface. It still comes up every fight and she's almost left because I can't get ""over it.""
My WS hasn't been terrible since getting sober, but we do still fight sometimes, maybe 1x a month. The fights havent been that bad since her getting sober either. She doesnt know how to cope with the simple fact that she broke me, and broke any chance we had at a normal relationship. 
She was a chaotic mess and while I shouldn't have married her, I didn't find out about her cheating or other nightmares she put me through until after the paperwork was signed and sent off to the courthouse. 

I dont know that I regret the marriage bexause it has a lot of financial benefits we enjoy, and a sense of stability ive been lacking my entire life, but I hate that what we have isn't a romantic partnership and I dont think ill ever trust her enough to allow that to happen again. 

Does anyone else feel like this? Like youre ready for the other shoe to drop and youre gonna have to deal with more WS cheating bullshit so you just have to accept what you have while you have it without giving them too much?

I've been working in coffee, leading roasting facilities and teams and helping guide small businesses, for 10 years. I perform a combination of team management, raw product manufacturing, oversight of packaging and order fulfillment, managing about $1m in contracts and logistics. I only make $70,000, which is below the area's median individual income. Our household income is also \~$25,000 below what is required to live comfortably. 

While income isn't everything, it's very important. I'm 37 and have less than $50,000 saved for retirement. We have zero debt besides our home - we even own our vehicles outright - but we've just always had an income problem rather than a spending problem. I feel wildly underpaid for how important my role is. 

Before I worked in coffee, I worked for five years in residential property maintenance. Started as a groundskeeper and was a supervisor within 4 years. We performed a lot of our own repairs on site, including low voltage electrical (typically just replacing a ballast or a bad receptacle, but we did have to re-do some incorrect connections throughout entire units a couple times; just simple swapping of hot and neutral, mostly). I've also done similar electrical work in my own home. I also do all of the maintenance on our vehicles and appliances, but I wouldn't say that I'm adept at these things - typically YouTube or repair manuals get me through.

I understand that electrical work can involve a lot of small finger manipulations, as well as lugging heavy reels of cable and pulling heavy wires. I'm not a muscular person, but I'm in good shape and don't have any injuries or handicaps that would hold me back physically. I am legally blind in one eye due to an injury as a child, but I hold a driver license and years ago I had looked at getting a CDL and was able to meet requirements for it. I've done heavy work in the past when I did maintenance, carpet cleaning, and drywall (when I was a teenager). That seems like a lifetime ago, though...  

I think I'm most interested in working in signals (not 100% sure), whether traffic or rail. Which of IBEW's apprenticeships would lead into a role such as that? I'm seeing that an IMSA certification is also required.

According to [IBEW 46's wage report](https://ibew46.com/resource-library/wages/), Inside Wiremen make the most. Looking at some articles that give an overview of what Inside Wiremen do, it sounds interesting to me as well. Setting up fire alarms or monitoring systems, installing fixtures, running new conduit, etc. 

What does the bulk of this job really look like?

* My brain fog, attention span, and patience have all improved exponentially.
* I am less anxious overall. 
* I've always had a pretty healthy diet, but consumed too many calories because of booze. Since stopping, any extra weight has fallen off, even with letting myself have a little sweet treat most nights. My body looks the best it has looked in a decade! In certain lighting (lol), I even have visible abs. 
* My physical fitness and strength have improved a lot due to my consistency with my exercise routine.
* My skin is healthy and glowing.
* I sleep through the night most nights, but if something wakes me up, I don't have racing thoughts for the next 3 hours. I just go back to bed. 
* I'm able to make early morning plans. 
* I think about alcohol a lot less than I thought I would. I crave a drink about once every 2-3 weeks, and the craving usually only lasts about 15 minutes. 
* I realized that I do not know a single ""moderate"" drinker. Most people I know either binge drink socially, drink daily, or don't drink at all/very, very rarely drink. It's been interesting to observe people's drinking patterns. 
* I got into 2 of the 3 grad school programs I applied to and will be going to grad school in the fall. 
* In general, I think I am more optimistic about the future. 

There is also one real downside: 

* My social life is much less active overall, and I feel like I have less fun at social gatherings. I still meet up with some friends for coffee dates or walk and talks, and I go to drinking events/parties and have NA drinks, but it isn't quite the same as having an unfiltered heart-to-heart over a bottle of wine, the ease of connection over cocktails with a new friend, or pulling up to a tropical bar on the first day of vacation. That isn't to say that I think my current quality of life is worth trading to do so, but I do feel nostalgic for those things and miss them, even if I don't actually miss anything else related to alcohol. However, I also force myself to remember all of the downsides, and that's what makes me feel like it's not worth it.

* **safety.**.. don't want to be in an area where you have to deal with or worry much about property crime, crazy people or people on meth binges walking around, cars getting broken into, etc - I realize this can be very much concentrated to pockets of cities, and no mid/big city is going to be totally free of this - so let's focus more on the desirable pockets of any given city when evaluating this criteria
* **aesthetics** \- for me this is modern buildings, sleek design, clean streets, etc (think River North in Chicago), but can also be the nature in the area or surrounding (mountains, ocean, parks/greenery, etc) - I just am a very visual person and waking up somewhere that is nice to look at really is a quality of life boost for me
* **food scene** \- not necessarily Michelin type of recognition, but more
   * quality/quantity of restaurants, diversity of options of cuisine, food truck scene & experimental
   * healthy fast-casual \[modern\] type of restaurants
   * farmers markets, organic grocery culture, farm to table, etc
* **ability to be outside & active** \- I like being outdoors - working out, sports, jogging/cycling, golfing, etc - weather that is conducive for this would be great, same with a culture around fitness/healthy living - the one thing I'm pretty sure I'd dislike is being in gray weather & cold for significant chunks of the year
   * snow is totally fine if (a) MST/PST and (b) there are mountains in the area - I like snowboarding/skiing - but not East Coast hills (mountains)... lots of snow with no way to make use of it is not appealing
   * by weather for outdoor activities - I mean like brutal heat and humidity is as undesirable to be outdoors in as ice storms are - so more just don't want any total extremes or things where you have to completely work around the weather calendar to do the many things I like to do
* a city with a **progressive & tech-welcoming culture** would be preferred... or even just things to facilitate it - coffee shops & coworking spots, entrepreneurial meetups, VCs and incubators, etc
* *all things equal, I'd prefer EST & CST to MST & PST - would mean I'm closer to family, and EST/CST works better for me with some side business things as well, but not a dealbreaker*

With this in mind, the main city I've thought about is **Denver (possibly Boulder too**, they seem close together enough - Boulder feels more like what I'd prefer, but I think it loses on dating options + tech scene/networking.

That being said, Denver doesn't really call to me for some reason... I'm not sold that it offers much more than other mid-major US cities outside of better than average sunlight & mountains, and the mountains seem like an effort to get to - I feel like if you're not driving out there 2+ times per month, you could probably get similar QOL at better COL.

She couldn""t understand but she felt strange when their eyes locked. She couldn""t explain the emotions that she could see from his eyes, it was as if everything was true.

It took a couple of seconds when Paul reacted to what she said. She saw how Paul""s Adam's apple moved upward and downward. It was as if he was feeling tense because of how their conversation was going.

But wasn""t this just a part of his rehearsal? Why did she suddenly feel different when their eyes met?

""Harmony, I am sorry but this isn""t just a rehearsal. This is what I am feeling right now. I am sorry but I think I am no longer happy with our relationship. I don""t know how it happened and when it happened. Just like I said, there""s just this one day I found out myself that I couldn""t feel the happiness I used to feel when I am with you and I don""t want to hide this to you. I don""t want to act as if nothing has changed on my part and let you believe that everything is fine between us,"" he said to her and then he bowed his head.

Harmony felt like there was a bucket of cold water that was poured onto her. She wanted to pinch herself thinking that she might just be in a dream and having a nightmare.

She couldn""t tell what was happening whether it was true or just an act. She couldn""t figure out whether Paul""s words were just part of his script or these were all true. She couldn""t believe that the man fell out of love with her. How could that happen?

Her mind was in turmoil.

They had been in a relationship since they were in college. So, what was he talking about? She was shocked and she couldn""t find the right words to say to Paul.

She tried to lift the cup of coffee that they ordered when they arrived earlier at the coffee shop but she accidentally spilled it to herself.

She felt the hot water in her skin. It means, this was reality.

Paul didn""t even bother to help her wipe the coffee that spilled on her. The man let her do it herself.

With trembling hands, she grabbed a tissue on the top of the table and wiped the coffee in her pants.

After she was done, she took a deep breath. She was hoping at the last second, Paul would say that this was just a prank. She was praying that the man was playing a trick on her and everything that was happening was just part of his games.

She swallowed a lump in her throat as she tried to search for the words that she was going to say to her long time boyfriend and soon to be her ex-boyfriend if she wouldn""t be able to fix what""s happening with them.

Harmony cleared her throat. She needed to be brave and make things clear to this man in front of her.

Though she could feel her heart beating so fast, she still wanted to clarify everything at Paul.

She looked into his eyes but she could see that the man couldn""t stand her look and from there, she knew that something was already wrong with her boyfriend.

But before she could even start to speak, Paul opened his mouth and spoke again.

""Harmony, I know that we have been together for almost three years and I am sorry if we will be ending our relationship just like this. I want to be honest to you. To myself. I don""t want to continue this relationship anymore and then both of us would suffer. I don""t want us to fight every day because I could no longer return the love that you have for me. I want to end this as early as now while we still have respect for each other. You have been so good to me and I don""t want to hurt you. I want us to be friends, to be good friends,"" Paul said which made her dumbfounded.

# Chapter 2

Harmony didn""t notice that Paul already left their table. She was left all alone inside the coffee shop. The man didn""t even wait for her to answer.

She felt the pinching sensation inside her heart and suddenly she felt it hard to breathe.

Three years of her life, that""s what she had spent with Paul and she couldn""t believe that she could utter those words that easily.

What the hell was he talking about? She couldn""t believe his reason that he woke up one day and found himself not to be in love with her anymore. Something might have happened or probably, he already met another woman. Just thinking about it, Harmony felt like her heart was being crumpled.

She didn""t notice that her tears were already flowing on her cheeks. She never thought that she would be feeling this kind of pain inside her heart. They were happy. They never really had problems that they never worked out or resolved. She and Paul never sleep at night with problems.

Harmony thought they were a picture-perfect relationship so she couldn""t help but feel confused because of what just happened.

There were a lot of questions inside her mind but she didn""t know if it was still worth knowing the answers for those questions because Paul clearly ended everything. He put a period in their relationship.

Suddenly, anger rose inside her chest because she felt that the man hadn""t been honest with her. Paul might have been seeing another woman that""s why all of a sudden he broke up with her without a clear and a valid explanation.

All of his words were bullsh\*t. The words he uttered were just nonsense so she couldn""t just easily believe them.

She was about to grab a tissue at the top of the table to wipe her tears when all of a sudden the chair in front of her where Paul was sitting moved and she saw a hand offering a handkerchief to her.

Harmony quickly lifted her head and she was thinking that it was Paul and he came back to tell him that everything he said was just a prank. But unfortunately, she was wrong.

""Here,"" the man said in a baritone voice. His ash gray eyes met her hazel brown eyes. She couldn""t help but wonder who the person was.

Her eyebrows were knitted together while she was staring at the handkerchief that the man was handing over to her.

Even if she was in a miserable situation because of the pain that was brought by what Paul did, she couldn""t just trust anyone that was around her. This was her perfect state for them to do something bad towards her.

""Get it and wipe your tears. Your face already has a horizontal black line so you might want to fix yourself,"" he said in a calm tone. ""People are looking in our direction and I don""t want them to think that I am the one who made you cry. Take this or I will fix your face for you.""

She couldn""t help but raise one of her eyebrows because of how the man was commanding her. So, Harmony didn""t move.

She didn""t have the time to talk to a conceited man. Who did he think he was? Why would she even talk to a stranger? She held herself from rolling her eyes because she didn""t know what this man could do to her.

Again, anger spiked inside her towards Paul for leaving her alone in this kind of situation and she suddenly felt fear because of this man in front of her.

""I am not a bad guy,"" he said and then he put the handkerchief on her hands. ""Go and wipe your tears before you look uglier,"" he added which made her eyes round.

How could he act as if they were close?

""Mr., look, I don""t even know you. So, why would I listen to you?"" She said she couldn""t restrain herself anymore because of how this man was acting. He was a total stranger and yet he was offering comfort which she never asked for.

""Calm yourself down and lower your voice before you drag all the people""s attention to our table,"" he said while looking at her.

Suddenly she felt like her heart skipped a beat because of the look that he gave her. Harmony felt like she was melting because of the kind of stare that the man was giving her.

So, she let out a sigh and wiped her face with his handkerchief because it seemed that the man wouldn""t stop bothering her until she wiped her face.

""Thank you,"" she said still to the man even if she was not asking for his help. She was about to stand up when he suddenly held her hand and stopped her from leaving.

She looked at her hand which was holding her hand. Suddenly, she felt a spark the moment that his hand touched her hand.

""Yes, Sir? How can I help you?"" She said while looking at the man wondering and at the same time her heart was beating so fast because of fear. What if this man would do something to her? How could she even fight him? The man looks muscular based on his biceps and he was also tall. She couldn""t do anything to defend herself just in case he would do something to her. But, he looked like a decent person. He was wearing a black suit with a tie so she couldn""t think that this man could hurt her in any possible way.

""Let""s talk,"" he said and her eyes were drawn together. She gave him a questioning look. What were they supposed to be talking about? ""Please go back to your seat,"" he added, which she followed for some reason.

Harmony sat down without taking her eyes off the man. She could feel her heartbeat pounding so fast.

""Be my girlfriend,"" the man said without beating around the bush.",1,1747675844.0,NovelNexus,1,1.0,False

	•	Protein bars that don’t taste like drywall
	•	Electrolyte or hydration packets
	•	Little extras—decent gloves, pain relief, gum, tools, morale stuff

What else?

But unknowingly to her at the moment, the days ahead would show her different paths. Paths that would take her to slowly finding out who she was. For as sat there on her bike, looking down a street just in front of her was that long all downhill from there. But the need to race! The need for speed was there! And she here now and ready for her run.

With her not always having the feeling of really not knowing on how or why she was here. But in a way she felt that she had always been here, but with her having that feeling in her that something felt different about her. Different in a way that no one could describe, but she only knew where she was at the moment! only knowing the moment! 

For this morning was hers, nothing was going to stop her from breaking her prior tries before. Taking one last look around her, just before letting it all go! Feeling the wind push up against her! Speeding in and around cars along the way!

With the feeling of something just being different about still residing within her, more so than usually toady. With the feeling that all of this still felt very new to her! The surroundings! The people! Everything thing about the place. But while everything seemed new to her! It still felt like she belonged here! That she had always been here.

Jenna’ was a young outgoing girl just shy of her 23rd birthday! Growing up in a small town that had a big city feel to it to her. But to Jenna’ it was her home, but she liked to think of it as a sprawling city that one day she would riding her bike through the downtown streets. 

Weaving in and around cars passing by them as the wind blew through her long Raven hair! feeling free from the world around her! Racing was her excitement! And it showed! With her smile saying it all. Making her way through the towns traffic passing by people with some waving as she passed them by.

With Jenna’ having the feeling of nothing could stop her from trying her best to break her speed time Pryor to each day.  Often finding herself at the other end of the local law enforcement, as officer Cross’ would many times say to her

“Jenna’! Now don’t make me write you a ticket today for speeding!” 

As he would always say laughingly to her. mainly it was just him watching out for her! For her own safety.  But Jenna’ also had someone else watching out for her! A young latino! Named Hector’! With his dark hair brown eyes! And a smile For Jenna’! But Jenna’ was just your typical young brown eyed girl! Who liked her shredded jeans and tee shirt and hoodie living her life! Her way. 

Occasionally finding some of the local boys racing with her trying to out do one another. With Jenna’ being the girl that she was! Never backing down from a challenge, finding herself racing through the towns streets, finding herself racing along with one or two others.

Not to say that one of them didn’t catch her eye! But! From time to time! His name was Hector! Hector’ Was a guy that charm on a dime. A Latino Who had a keen mind and the street smarts to match! Especially on a bike. Often calling out to Jenna’ saying to her!

“So you think you’re fast huh! Well maybe we can just find out just how fast you can go!”

But at the same time finding himself racing along side of Jenna’ Whether it be on the streets or on one of many mountain trails that surrounded them. Knowing that each had feelings for the other, but never really acting on it. Knowing that Jenna’ was a well to do girl, often finding himself with Jenna’ leaving him with a glance and a smile! as Jenna’ left him looking. And saying to himself “Dam! That’s my girl!”

Just way the way he liked it! Always watching out for her. While Jenna’ didn’t have many people in her life or let many get close to her, Hector was different! 

Leaving everyone she met with a smile she was a girl with a slim build standing at around five foot and four inches. Gliding her way through the traffic imagining as if she was racing through the downtown streets of San Francisco. Often finding herself riding her bike for the bike was her life her way of escape. She even had a name for her bike often calling it ‘Quicksilver’ riding her bike faster and farther each day. Finding new trails along the way but with each new trail she would ride. It was like it was showing something to her! As if it was trying to tell her something! 

But with each new day bringing something new to her! A new trial, a new street to ride on, and occasionally a new person.

Finding herself Occasionally stopping by the local bike shop finding herself talking to Jack’ for jack was like a big brother to her. One who also knew himself on a bike, Jenna’ would often find herself talking to listening to Jack tell her all about his days in the big city. Telling Jrnna’ about his own street races, with Jenna’ always enjoying there talks whenever she was in his shop.

For whenever she was on her bike she felt faster than anyone around her and that there was nothing that she could not do on that bike. One street in particular had a steep incline to it for the street itself was not very long but long enough for what Jenna’ needed it be. 

For it gave her enough speed that it felt as if she could go on forever! Dodging in and out of traffic! But always avoiding the people as she would often came onto the sidewalk bringing a lot of speed passing people as they made their way. 

Sometimes she would dream as if she was riding her bike through the streets of San Francisco or New York. But Life for Jenna’ was here in her hometown it was often just a carefree life for her. More than often finding herself thinking about her life! For oddly enough it just did not feel like it was her life! It felt as if she was living someone else’s life other than her own. 

For many times while riding on one of the many trials outside of town. She would often find herself on a different trail! Leading her to new areas, to new adventures, as if it was showing her thoughts! Thoughts that wasn’t her thoughts! It was as if they belonged to someone else. It was as if she was seeing things as someone else’s was seeing them! 

But for now life for her was just her and her bike the one possession in her life that she most often cared for the most. Making her way through the streets making her way the local coffee shop where she worked. Often finding herself dreaming of a life being on her own making her  own way in life on her bike.

Just as a regular walked in to set down to enjoy his morning cup of joe. A regular, who was named Voodoo’ or at least his friends would call him that! Often finding himself telling Jenna’ about his own little bike rides. When he was a bike rider from the city! A regular that Jenna’ came know from their talks at the coffee shop.

Voodoo’ would often tell Jenna’ about his many adventures aboard and local, telling her that even though there were many great locations about. That there was none like our very own town that we had here, for the many great nights he had here in the mountains when he was younger.

Jenna’ always enjoyed there talks often telling him about her own little adventures in the mountains.

But oddly enough whenever Voodoo’ would talk about the town that they were in, that he would say that this is where I wanted to be buried.

That For all of his many travels to many different places, seeing all that he had seen! That in the end that this was his home! This was where he wanted his final resting place to be.

For often Jenna’ would find herself in the mountains just outside of the town riding her bike on some of its many trails one particular. A trial that she would often ride a trial where she was at the moment making her way through it. Gliding past the trees catching glimpses of the sun as its light glimmered through the trees around her.

It was a warm day as she could feel and see the nature of the forest all around her with nothing but blue sky ahead of her. Approaching the place where she would often come. Jenna’ would find herself setting there on her bike overlooking a ravine where in the distance she could see the town in which she had grew up in. 

She would often refer to it as Angels Ravine, For to anyone standing there could look as if they were looking out into a dream. A Ravine that seemed to go on forever over into the valley ahead. It was almost as if you was an Angel looking out from Heaven itself it was a quit place it was her place. Often finding herself there where she would come to often

But just on the other side of Angels Ravine, was a mountain trail that many bikers dared not to challenge. But not Jenna’ for she knew one day that she would conquer that path, but unknowingly at the time. She would find herself with Hector and others in a challenge that they would never forget. Finding herself there on many occasions just to relax, to think about her life! Thinking about her life growing up for she didn’t have any family or many friends. 

Or at least any that she could remember. 

And the few she had, had moved away after High school whether it was for college or just Life itself. But a couple of people who she find herself talking to or occasionally racing against here in the city streets. Or on one of the many trails that was on the outskirts of town, Jenna’ found that life for her was there in the mountains along with her bike.

But as the day grew long with Jenna’ setting there on the ledge looking down into the ravine below her Knowing that she should be heading back. For the darkness never really bothered her for she had many times ridden back in the dark under a nights sky. 

For Jenna’ loved riding at night under a starlit sky above her for being alone with nothing but her and stars in the sky. For she knew the area really well and enjoyed its peace that it brought to her but also kept a light on her. that she could attach to the front of her bike as she rode through the trails she could feel nothing but a somber feeling all over her. But as the nights cool breeze blew against her sending feelings of thoughts that would sometimes come over her. 

Thoughts that oddly enough did not feel like her thoughts, thoughts that often would feel like they belonged to someone else’s. Finding herself later that night after arriving back at her apartment the rain had just begun to fall standing there in the rain. Thinking to herself a thought that would often come to her 

“If I am not me then who am I “

A thought that she often would find herself thinking about but always keeping them to herself. While also thinking to herself who else would she tell for oddly enough it seemed that it was just only her. Having no family at least none that she ever knew of it for it had always just been her by herself.

With only the people around her that was already there making her way inside setting down into her cozy little chair. There she would set listening to the rain falling just outside as it came down. Setting there thinking as she would often do about her life then slowly as she would began to fall asleep listening to the rain. Just as a dream would come to her. 

A dream that she would often have a dream that she would often find herself thinking about a lot. Thinking was this her life? But as she dreamed a girl she could see a girl that looked identical to her as if she was her sister her twin but in another Life. 

Always being the same girl but in different places but never where Jenna’ was! Never in the same town that she had grew up in. In the dream the girl never acknowledged her or even looked at her as if she was seeing another girls life as if it was her Life. But as the dreams would come they would go,

 Waking up in the chair that she would often find herself fallen asleep in looking out of the window into the suns morning light.

Thinking to herself 

“Why am I seeing this other girl? If I am me then who is she?”

Walking over to the window looking out into a sun filled day, looking at people as they would pass by. Some she knew, while others being new to the area! Standing there thinking if any of these people could be who they are! Could they be of someone else from somewhere else!

Thinking back on her time here, thinking back on her job, though she remembers working there. But she couldn’t remember when she first started there! It was like she had always been there! Just then realizing that she was late for work. Forgoing the morning shower slipping into her work clothes Jenna’ rushed out of her front door grabbing her bike on the way. knowing that speed was going to be her best friend this morning. 

Making her way through the streets the only way she knew weaving in out of the traffic occasionally hearing the honking of a car horn. throwing their hand up ether by saying a hello or to just watch where you are going. To Jenna’ that was her Life! Being on her bike loosing herself in the world around her! Racing as the wind blowing up against her making her way through the town. For today was going to be a good day not only at work seeing not only the Locals coming in giving a smile to people from all over. 

People who was either just passing through or in town for the it’s many mountain trails. Finding herself telling passerby’s of many of her own mountain adventures. For after her shift at the coffee house was over Jenna’ herself was then going to head back out to Angels Ravine for Angels Ravine was what Grace would refer to it by.

For it was to her of what Heaven would be like, for it was her own little piece of Heaven. But this time she was not only planning on just a day trip but on spending the night there. Surprisingly as her work day would go much faster than normal having only a few customers here and there. With excitement grabbing her bike leaving her work day behind her headed for the door she couldn’t wait for to her getting there was half the fun. 

Riding her bike out of town it was only a couple of miles down the road to where the trial leading up to Angels Ravine was. It was a warm afternoon as always Grace enjoyed the ride hearing the sounds of nature all around her. With the occasional breeze that would make its way through the trees. normally she would be trying to best her own speed trying to best herself. 

But this time was different this day would be different, for a couple of days back a group of outsiders. A group that Jenna’ had not seen in the area before, a group of young cocky bike riders. Had challenged Jenna’ and Hector to a race, but not just any race but a race down the other side of Angels Ravine.

With Jenna’ and Hector arriving at the site first finding themselves setting there looking out over Angels Ravine. Setting there just enjoying the moment together talking about their time in the town together. The times that they had racing one another through the streets, coming up here to mountains. Setting there on Angel’s Ravine looking out over into the Ravine just ahead of them Jenna’ then turned to Hector asking him

“Do you ever think that you was someone else’s before”

With a puzzled look on Hector’s face he then replied back to her saying 

“Someone Else’s! No! What kind of question is that? Jenna’ are you feeling okay!”

With smiling to him just as she said 

“It’s just! I really don’t know! It’s like I’m or was someone else, I can’t really explain it.”

With Hector giving a laugh as he said to her

“I don’t know what I would do with two Jenna’s All I know is how I feel about the Jenna’ that is here now, setting here beside of me.”

With Jenna’ then giving him a smile just she then placed her head his shoulder saying to him

“I don’t know what I would do another me either! I can barely handle myself at times”

With Hector placing his arms around Jenna’ before telling her

“I Don’t think I could handle another you either! laughing, I just know that I am holding the one Jenna’ that I want to be with.”

Giving each other a smile as they set there looking out into what could be there future ahead.

But just before they could get lost in the moment again, the other group had arrived.

They had arrived ready to show their dominance on the mountain, but with Jenna’ and Hector ready eager to show them other wise. 

The challenge was underway with Hector taking the lead first going down the steep incline, quickly followed by the outsiders, with Jenna’ trailing but was soon to catch up. 

The trail was daunting with very steep inclines, as they raced along the mountain trail. But just as Hector was out in front one of the outsiders came up from behind him. Running purposefully close to him knocking him off balance sending him crashing off the trail. 

With Jenna’ then stopping to check on him as Hector’ then motioned to her saying to her

“Go! Go get ‘em Jenna! You got this!”

And with that it wasn’t too long before Jenna’ had caught up to them, for Jenna’ knew the trails like no other. 

Racing hard and fast to the finish side by side! Just as Jenna’ then gave him a look and smile to the outsider as she then pulled away. just the outsider went flying off of the trail! Leaving him setting there as Jenna’ had won the race.

Later that evening Jenna’ and Hector’ would spend the evening together, talking to each other. Talking about what may be store in the future for them as Hector then slowly looked to Jenna’ just before giving her a kiss.

With Hector’ then saying goodbye to Jenna’ as he then headed back to town leaving Jenna’ there for the night.

As she came to the ravine Jenna’ then found herself setting down on the ledge looking out over the valley over across the mountains ahead. Thinking to herself that this was Heaven at least what Heaven would be like to her. After setting up her camp for the night setting down again looking out into the sunset as its light shined down onto the valley out into the town below. For many sunrise and sunsets Jenna’ had watched from there. 

But this one was different in a way that she could not describe with only a few words but just looking out into it. It was if time itself was coming to an end. 

Looking back down unto the town as the light of the sun shown down on it Jenna’ began to think to think back on her Life wondering to herself if she had a family out there somewhere. 

Wondering that if she did have a family what would her family be like? What was her childhood like? 

For as far back Jenna’’ could remember she had no family. For growing up all she could remember was that one morning she just woke up being in a place with the town and the people around her. But not as her family just people in her life a life that has seemingly went by all too fast. With the sun now slowly setting behind the mountains ahead of her.

Jenna’ would set there enjoying it as the last of its light would slowly disappear behind the mountains as the first star of the night would appear over head. Feeling a cool breeze starting to set in as Jenna’ lay there in her sleeping bag looking up into the starlit sky that was adorned above her. lying there just simply enjoying a nice quite night but as sleep would find her. 

The same dream the same dream that Jenna’ had so many times before. With the same girl the girl that Jenna’ would refer to her as her identical sister from what seemed to be from another Life. 

Living her life but not the same as her for everything around her was different, different in the way she had lived before! Before the town that she lived in now! But this time something happened that had never happened before. A name was said that had never been said before in the dream and that was name of the girl in her dreams someone then called her Jenna’

Suddenly waking up to the morning’s light putting her hands up to her head Jenna’ just set there stunned. Thinking to herself

“Who was this other Jenna’ And why do I keep seeing her?”

Feeling how real the dream was for her, unlike the others that dream actually seemed as if I was there! I was her! 

Still visibly shaken as Jenna’ just sat there looking around suddenly startled by a presence. 

With the presence being of a man standing there just outside of the tree line standing there looking at her. But Just before Jenna’ began to scream! A calmness suddenly came over her a feeling of something telling her that everything was alright. Just as the man spoke saying

 “Hello Jenna’ it is a pleasure to meet you so please do not be alarmed. For I am not here to harm you” 

With a feeling of relief coming over Jenna’ as Jenna’ then replied saying to himself

“Then why are you standing there looking at me! And how do you know my name?” 

“I know all about you Jenna’ I know your entire Life up until now. And I know the answer that you seek” 

With Jenna’ then replying 

“Answers to what? What answers do I seek” 

“ Dreams, Jenna’ your dreams.” 

As Jenna’ just set there still stunned now more curious then ever Jenna’ just suddenly shouted out the girl! Who was the girl in my dreams? 

The man then just smiled and simply said that 

“It is you Jenna’ and it is not you”

More confused then ever Jenna’ just replied by saying 

“Me! How” 

Just as the man then slowly approached Jenna’ standing there looking out into the valley below as he then said to her. 

“ In your Life you was you, and she was her in her Life.”

“But now in this Life you are her and she is not! and you are not. For her Life is her Life! For the Life that was once you is a Life that is no longer your Life” 

with Jenna’ then replying 

“Is this Heaven then and are you an Angel?” 

With a smile the man just simply said 

“ I am who I am! someone that is there, someone that knows. And no this is not Heaven! This is your Heaven Jenna’ And this is your Life the Life that you ask for” 

just as the man then slowly made his way back to the tree line. He then turned and said to Jenna’

 “The dreams shall now end, and your dreams shall begin.” 

“For do not look at what was then, just look at what is now! But look for what is to come!  for Life itself is the most precious thing that a person can have!”

“Now go and Live your Life Jenna’ for Life is what has been granted to you” 

Just then as the mysterious man then disappeared into the tree line never again to be seen by Jenna’ was now standing there looking out over Angels Ravine, Jenna’ couldn’t help but to feel a little different about her Life. 

As the then dreams of the girl was now slowly fading away from her forever. With only her dreams to come! Living a Life of whatever was to come for Jenna’

Looking down onto her town, the town seemed different to her it seemed different because now for it was her town her home. Her Life! With Jenna’ now leaving Angels Ravine, making her way back home, but as usual finding herself racing to beat her own best time.

Jenna’ was now making her way back into in Life, riding through the streets on her bike weaving in and out of traffic. For the streets was hers and Life on her bike was now going to take her places that she had never gone before. She was riding into Life! into her 

Life Living a Life of what she made it. For Jenna’ had found Grace!

So I (M25) have this female coworker (F24) that I really hit off lately and we often send each other reels and stuff. We don't work together that often so we don't see each other often. I don't even know how we ended up having that good connection because we see eachother maybe once in a month, especially because she tells me that she hates basically everyone at work except me (and she really does behave that way).

Anyways, I added her on Instagram randomly after one shift together and she started sending me reels and talking to me. That has been going for maybe 2 months now. All would be good but there is one major thing - she has a boyfriend. That's why I never initiated dm-ing her on instagram or anything like that, she initiated it first, many times. 

Lately she started giving me hints like sending me reels about how we only hang out at work but never outside of work etc. Again, I didn't want to invite her out because she has a boyfriend. Few hints and few days later she sends me straight up message ""We should go get some coffee together one day and not hangout only at work."" I was like yeah definitely and she told me that she is free anytime so I can hit her up whenever I want and we can go.

I don't know what to do because of the boyfriend thing. She isn't a type of person that would ask anyone's permission on doing something so I think that her boyfriend doesn't even know about this. What's even more weird, she has a million highlights on Instagram full of hanging out with her female friends etc. but on none of them is her boyfriend, not even on ""close friends"" ones.

Don't get me wrong, she is super hot and if she was available I would never give it second thought.

I've been deep in research this weekend and I just realized I left out some important info (that at the time I didn't think all that important) is that along with our small space and ideally somewhat aesthetic set up is that we both prefer light roasts generally and our favorite cafe is more on the third wave coffee side of things. Would that change suggestions or which grinder machine to go with? 

I also found a Diletta Bello+ in a nearby city with a Varia grinder and accessories for $1999, which was originally above my budget. Would that be a good buy? 

The combo I was leaning towards after all the information given was a Profitec Go and either the Lagom mini 2, J-ultra hand grinder or the DF54 grinder. I liked the Timemore as well but I'd probably have to wait a few more months to save up for that one.

1kqh5xr,https://www.reddit.com/r/WashingMachineReviews/comments/1kqh5xr/can_tide_powder_detergent_mountain_spring_deliver/,Can Tide Powder Detergent Mountain Spring Deliver on Stain Removal? In-Depth Review,"Laundry days can be a real chore, but having the right detergent can make all the difference. Over the past month, I’ve been using Tide 037000850052 Powder Laundry Detergent, Mountain Spring (143 oz), and there’s a lot to unpack about this product. As someone who goes through laundry loads daily—thanks to the chaotic messes my kids create, combined with gym clothes and the occasional coffee spill—I feel well-equipped to dive deep into every corner of this detergent’s performance. And spoiler alert: while it has some stellar strengths, there are definitely trade-offs to consider.

**Fresh Design and Convenience**  
The first thing I noticed about this detergent was how compact yet substantial the packaging felt. For a 143-ounce powder detergent, it doesn’t overwhelm in size despite its strong cleaning promise. It fits snugly in my laundry room cabinet without eating up space, which is a blessing for someone juggling multiple storage woes. The Mountain Spring scent isn’t just a label—it’s a refreshing aroma that lingers softly on clothes without being overpowering. That’s something I didn’t expect but have come to appreciate every time I bury my face in freshly laundered towels or clothes.

**Performance and Cleaning Power**  
One of the product’s claims that initially caught my attention was its ability to attack even seven-day-old stains with its Acti-Lift Crystals. During testing, I threw in a visibly grimy, ketchup-smeared T-shirt my toddler managed to ruin a week earlier. To my delight, the stains lifted significantly after a single wash. Similarly, dirt-packed gym socks, grass-stained jeans, and even wine-streaked tablecloths came out brighter than expected. Granted, it didn’t always work like magic on *every* fabric, but for an everyday detergent, it really holds its own.

For my high-efficiency (HE) washing machine, this detergent has turbo technology that promises more power during shorter cycles. While I admit I was skeptical, it seriously delivered results comparable to longer washes I’ve done with traditional detergents. A definite win for both my time and my energy bill.

**Check [Tide 037000850052] price on Amazon.**

**User-Friendliness and Scent**  
The Mountain Spring scent is undoubtedly one of my favorite things about this product. Unlike some detergents that overdo it with perfume-like smells, this one strikes a pleasant balance—it feels crisp, fresh, and very natural. My clothes smell clean without screaming, ""I was dunked in artificial fragrance!"" Plus, the powder itself dissolves quickly and evenly during washes, ensuring there’s no annoying residue left behind on clothes, which is a deal-breaker for me with powdered cleaners.

**Positives**  
There’s an impressive lineup of upsides with this detergent:  
- Strong stain-fighting capabilities, even for older stains.  
- Specially designed for both regular and high-efficiency machines.  
- Turbo technology optimizes quick-cycle washes without cutting corners.  
- Mountain Spring scent adds a refreshing touch without being overpowering.  

**Disadvantages**  
That said, it’s not perfect. I did notice a couple of areas that could use improvement:  
- Powder sometimes clumps in humid conditions if not sealed tightly.  
- Heavier stains (like oil or paint) might require pre-treatment for better results.  

**Competing Products**  
The laundry detergent market is teeming with competitors, many of which I’ve tried before. Arm & Hammer’s powder variant comes to mind—it’s cost-efficient, and the baking soda infusion is a plus, though it doesn’t always tackle tougher stains as effectively as this detergent does. Then there’s Persil ProClean, which performs similarly well with its intense cleaning focus, but it comes at a steeper price and lacks the appealing Mountain Spring scent of this product. While each brand has its strengths, Tide emerges as a more balanced option—offering solid results without pricing itself out of reach.

**Worth Every Penny**  
Considering the blend of efficiency, stain-fighting action, and aroma, the product offers excellent value for its features. While it may not be the absolute cheapest option on the shelf, it most certainly earns its spot as a “bang-for-the-buck” purchase compared to pricier alternatives with marginally better results. Its versatility to perform well in both regular and HE machines further elevates its cost-efficiency. If you’re on the fence, it’s worth checking whether it aligns with your needs and preferences.

Chapter 1

Via

My reflection was lying to me.

She was showing me a happy woman in bright red lipstick and coral eye shadow, a woman who looked like she’d just won the lottery—not a brokenhearted woman who’d spent the past four years trying to put her life back together.

You don’t look your age...You don’t look your age...

I could practically pinpoint where my wrinkles would come in, where the creases near my eyes would multiply and spread out over time; where my lips would eventually thin out and dissolve into my mouth. So far I’d been lucky, but I was pretty sure the hundreds of anti-aging and wrinkle-prevention creams I’d been using were the real reason why.

I was turning forty in two weeks and I was suffering from all the symptoms of a mid-life crisis. I was questioning everything I’d ever done, comparing myself to all my friends, and wondering if I would ever find more fulfillments in life. I’d even started making a list of everything I needed to do once I hit the big 4-0:

1. Make a plan to quit my job in five years and pursue my dream career: Interior Design.
2. Pay off all my credit cards and start making larger mortgage payments on my house.
3. Stop reading so many romance books...
4. Save up enough to take my daughters on a week-long cruise in the summer.
5. Stop looking for potential wrinkle-lines and quit considering Botox.
6. Clean my house from top to bottom and KEEP it clean!
7. Stop blaming myself for my ex-husband’s affair...
8. Stop hating my ex-best friend for being part of the affair...
9. Treat myself to a new restaurant every month.
10. Learn to be happy alone.

“Via! Let’s go! We’re going to be late!” My friend Sandra called from the kitchen.

“Coming! Coming!” I grabbed my jacket and headed downstairs.

I took another glance at myself in the hallway mirror and cursed under my breath. I couldn’t believe I’d agreed to let her drag me out to another singles mixer. I never found anyone worth my time at those things, and the foul scent of desperation always hung in the air.

“You look stunning!” Sandra tugged at my strapless black dress. “Can I please borrow your wardrobe?”

“Only if I can borrow your life...”

She rolled her eyes and ignored my pessimism as usual. “Tonight is the night you’ll meet the right guy! I can feel it!”

She always says that...

“Do we really need to go to another one of these things, Sands? I have some marketing research I could—”

“On New Year’s Eve? Are you out of your mind? We’re going out!”

“What’s the point? We’ve been to a ton of these things and it’s always the same...Can’t we just stay in, drink some wine, and go over our resolutions?”

“Via...” She walked over to my front door and opened it. “We’re going out. Now. You don’t have any work to do and you know it. And it’s your turn to drive so let’s go!”

––––––––

I stood in the winding buffet line and tossed a few veggie chips onto my plate. I looked up at the banner that hung over the bar and sighed. It read “New Year’s Middle-Aged Singles’ Mixer: Let’s Get Jiggy!”

Aside from the tacky banner, the interior of Pacific Bay Lounge left a lot to be desired: Surfboards served as table tops, old park benches were strewn about, and dingy blue and green streamers hung from the ceiling to simulate “waves.”

Tonight, the lounge was way over-capacity—not a huge surprise since lonely people seemed to flock to these types of events. I was so used to them that I’d become quite the people reader: The guy standing by the window was at least sixty, the blond hair dye he’d been using to look twenty years younger was beginning to fade. The woman who was dancing against the speakers was clearly going through a divorce; she was still wearing her wedding ring and she tossed back a shot every time the DJ yelled “Cheers to all the single ladies!”

I’d been there. Done that.

On the window seats that lined the far wall, shy women were fidgeting with their hair and clothes like nervous high school students. Most of them were being forced to be here and had probably never had a fully-functioning relationship in their lives.

I grabbed two beers from the end of the table and sat on an empty couch, observing one man’s poor attempt to get a shy woman to dance.

“Is this seat taken?” A gorgeous man with grey eyes smiled at me, interrupting my fascinating people watch.

“No. No, it’s not...”

“Great.” He sat down and put his beer on the table. “I’m Lance. What’s your name?”

“Via. Via Donovan.”

“That’s a pretty name. What do you do for a living, Via?”

“I’m a marketing director for a software company. What do you do?”

He tapped the label on his beer. “I own and manage a beer company, Leyland Beers. It’s in Nevada.”

“Very impressive,” I said. “So, what do you—”

“How old are you, if you don’t mind me asking?”

Ugh, here we go...

“I’m thirty-nine, and yourself?”

“Wow...” He looked me up and down. “I’m forty seven. Do you have any kids?”

I felt myself smiling. “Two daughters. You?”

“No, I don’t have any kids. Life’s way too short for that—no offense. Can I call you sometime?”

Seriously? Is that all it takes these days? Age? Kids? Phone number? Is the art of conversation that DEAD?

“Umm sure...” I forced a smile. “It’s—”

“Wait. How old are your kids? Are they ‘with-the-babysitter-tonight-age’ or are they ‘secretly-stealing-beer-out-of-your-cabinet-while-you’re-gone-age’? I have to be frank with you because I’m not looking for anything serious, and all you women with kids tend to be more—”

“You know what?” I stood up. “I have to go to the restroom. I’ll be right back.”

I pushed through the crowd and made my way to the outside deck, where lots of singles were watching the ripples of the Pacific Ocean swell up and down. I took a deep breath and inhaled the salty wet air—the one thing I had yet to get used to since moving to the West Coast.

I looked over my shoulder and saw Sandra talking to yet another guy, teasingly rubbing his shoulder and biting her lip. She caught me staring and motioned for me to come over. She was mouthing “He has a friend!”

I turned around and rolled my eyes.

“I take it you’re not having a good time?” A husky voice said from beside me.

I didn’t even bother looking at him. I didn’t want to engage in any more pointless conversations or mundane introductions. I just wanted to go home.

I sighed. “I’m thirty nine. My birthday’s in two weeks. I’ve been divorced for four years and I have two teenaged daughters.”

I didn’t hear him say anything else. I turned to my left and saw that he was halfway across the deck.

I took another swig of my beer and shook my head. I knew I wasn’t helping myself by pushing every potential suitor away, but I couldn’t help it. I still couldn’t believe that I was actually single.

My life had been picture perfect years ago—fourteen year marriage to a man who I thought loved me, pretty Pittsburgh neighborhood in the suburbs, amazing career that was almost on the brink of being legendary—but then one day it was over. Just like that. The priceless picture couldn’t be put back together; it couldn’t be saved.

It was tattered, forever ruined, and I was the one who emerged with the most cuts...

I sent Sandra a text and made a break for the parking lot, turning down numerous offers to dance on my way out.

“Hey, hey, hey!” Sandra climbed inside the truck and shut the door. “We’ve only been here twenty minutes! Don’t you at least want to stay for the New Year’s countdown?”

“No.”

“Why? What’s wrong? I saw the guy you were talking to in there! He was good-looking!”

“Look Sands, I’m not twenty anymore. I can’t keep coming to these things expecting to meet the love of my life. I met mine already, remember?” My voice cracked. “It didn’t work out...”

I leaned back in my seat and forced a lump down my throat.

The thought of losing my husband to my best friend still hurt to think about. The divorce was long over, but the pain still woke me up some nights, still dragged me out of my sleep and hit me over my heart like a twenty pound sledgehammer.

“You’re thinking about Ryan and Amanda, huh?” She handed me a Kleenex. “You have to stop beating yourself up about it. It wasn’t your fault.”

“I was so blind to it!” I began to cry. “I let her in my house! I trusted her with my kids! I trusted them both with everything!”

“I’m so sorry, Via...”

––––––––

My marriage to Ryan Hayes was a fairytale—at least it was to me. Don’t get me wrong, it wasn’t entirely perfect, but we had far more amazing days than good days, more good days than average days, and hardly any bad days.

Ryan was everything I ever wanted in a man. He was attentive and caring, thoughtful and compassionate, and he always remembered the little things that made me happy: Hot coffee on the rainy days I spent typing away in our home office, a warm blanket when I fell asleep in front of the fireplace, and endless chocolate chip cookies and candy bars whenever it was my time of the month. That was of course before he cheated on me with my best friend and knocked her off with a baby.

# Chapter 2

Chapter 2

Via

Every time he came home from work, he brought me a single red rose and kissed me like his life depended on it. He treated me to the country club’s spa once a month while he volunteered to watch our daughters for the day. He even surprised me sometimes by beating me home and cooking dinner for all of us.

He was my rock. My soul. My everything.

I honestly thought our love would transcend time, that I was one of the lucky ones who would be able to truly uphold the “til death do us part” mantra.

Yet, somewhere between the thirteenth and fourteenth year of our marriage, Ryan began to change.

He started coming home later and later. He didn’t leave his cell phone out like he normally did; he was extremely protective of it and often took calls in another room. He was more elusive—vague, and anytime I said that I needed to run to the store, he would jump up and volunteer to do it for me.

At first, I figured that the late nights had something to do with his new promotion to partner at the law firm; that his recent clingy-ness to his cellphone was just him wanting to be alert should he receive an emergency client call. I couldn’t figure out why he was volunteering to do every single grocery run since he’d always loathed any type of shopping, but I took advantage of not having to do it myself.

I chalked everything up to him wanting to be a “super-husband,” and used my extra free time to hang out with my best friend since high school, Amanda.

Amanda’s vivacious personality could force the most sullen person to smile. Her voluminous auburn hair and naturally toned body could rival most teenagers, and her love for literature was as immense as mine.

At age thirty five, she and her husband Barry were still attempting to have their first baby. They’d attempted everything short of hiring a surrogate, but they hadn’t lost hope.

With each in-vitro fertilization treatment, I would bring her a new baby purchase—booties, bibs, collectible teddy bears, and assure her that the doctors were wrong, that she could and would bring a child into the world.

So, when she called me one afternoon with news that she was finally pregnant, I cancelled my family BBQ and relocated our celebration to her and Barry’s home.

Six months later, Barry called me while I was leaving work. He was talking so fast that I could only make out every other word.

“Barry?” I tried to sound calm. “I can’t...I can’t understand you...Are you crying? Is something wrong with Amanda? Is she okay? Did something happen with the baby?”

“The baby,” he said, and then he was quiet for a while. “The baby...The baby’s not mine. It’s not mine...”

“What? Barry, you’re being ridiculous. You two have been trying to have a baby in every way possible for years. You’re just nervous because he’s almost here. You’re going to be a great father and—”

“I was going back and forth to Texas in May...We might’ve had sex once during that month. Maybe.”

I stilled. I remembered that.

Amanda had been complaining about how little he was at home due to his job. He’d been demoted and his company was making him do all the grunt work, denying his request to attend out-of-state meetings via video chat.

I remembered her crying about how alone she felt, how she didn’t think Barry was as serious about having a natural born baby as she was because he’d started talking about adoption.

Still, I refused to believe that Amanda’s baby wasn’t his. Who else could it have belonged to?

“Barry, I think you’re being paranoid...That one time could’ve been the time you know? I think you should call and discuss this with her. I don’t think I’m the right—”

“It’s not mine.” He groaned. “Meet me at the Marriott around the corner from your job. I know you two are supposedly great friends, but I need to show you something.”

“Okay...” I hung up and called Ryan.

“Hey baby,” he whispered. “I’m in a meeting. What’s going on?”

“I need you to pick the girls up from dance practice today.”

“Okay, not a problem. Is something wrong?”

“No, I—” I was about to tell him that Barry had called me crying about Amanda, but there was a strange voice in the back of my head telling me not to. “I need to run a few errands and I won’t be able to pick them up on time. That’s all.”

“Okay babe. See you at dinner.”

When I made it to the Marriot’s lobby, I saw Barry hurling pennies into the wishing well, cursing at any one who dared to stare at him.

His eyes were swollen and bloodshot, and he reeked of stale cigarette smoke and alcohol.

I tapped him on the shoulder and he turned around in a rage. But then his eyes softened and he hugged me tightly. “Thank God you’re here...Come with me.”

He motioned for me to follow him inside the hotel’s upscale lounge and ordered a bottle of the most expensive champagne on the menu. Sighing several times, he shook his head over and over.

“I’ve never really liked wine, Via.” He filled his glass until it slightly overflowed. “It was always Amanda’s thing. I always thought it tasted like horse shit. The more expensive it is, the worse it tastes.”

He’s losing it...I knew I should’ve called Amanda on my way over here... I’ll go call her in the restroom...

“Barry, I’m going to run to the—”

“She insisted on having this very brand at our wedding. Did you know that?”

I shook my head.

He took a large gulp and exhaled. “Yep. 1975 Chateau Trotanoy—it’s a Bordeaux...And it’s still as disgusting as it was on the day I married her.”

“Barry...”

“That’s why I find it quite fitting to drink now, especially since I’ll be filing for a divorce in the morning.”

WHAT!

“I don’t feel comfortable with you telling me this.” I stood up. “You need to go home and talk to—”

“My wife? My philandering, lying, ‘doesn’t-give-a-shit-about-me’ wife? I don’t think so.” He pulled an envelope from his breast pocket and slid it to me. “I hired someone weeks ago to follow her, to find out where the fuck she was spending all her extra time.”

I sat down and opened the envelope, flipping through the pictures: Amanda was shopping at a few boutiques, hanging out with me, and attending first time mommy classes.

I stopped flipping and put the stack down. “Okay. I need you to listen to me. I really don’t think—”

“I didn’t believe it was true either. I mean, my guy would always come back with the same photos week after week. She was at home, at your house, out shopping. Pretty typical stuff on the surface and I almost called him off the job. I thought I was being paranoid. But then one day at dinner I happened to ask her about you. I said, ‘So, how has Via liked being a freelance marketing director? Is it better than working for an ad agency?’ She said you hadn’t worked at home for years, that you’d been working sixty hour weeks at Cole and Hillman downtown. So I asked myself: If Via isn’t at home during the day, who is Amanda going there to see? It can’t be Via’s daughters. They’re in school. So...”

It took me several minutes to absorb what he was trying to imply, several more to even wrap my head around such a ridiculous assertion.

“No.” I shook my head. “No...There’s no way. There’s a perfectly good explanation if...” I picked up the packet of photos and flipped through them again.

They were all circumstantial: Amanda’s car parked outside my house—she loved my neighborhood’s walking course and often left her car in my driveway to do one of her “thought-walks.” There were pictures of her walking along the Hot Metal Bridge in the rain, sitting alone on a bench—probably crying about Barry not being at home again. But then there were pictures of Ryan, my Ryan, sitting next to her on that bench. Kissing her on that bench.

There were pictures of their cars parked outside the Hilton in Greentree—the next town over, pictures of them walking through the city park hand in hand, pictures of them having sex from the open windows of my bedroom.

The date on this bedroom photo is yesterday...

Barry lifted a photo from my hands. “I went to that Hilton myself...I followed them there in a cab. I waited thirty minutes before going inside and pretended to be her brother who happened to get lost on the way. I walked over to the front desk clerk and said, ‘My sister is always bragging about how nice this place is, how often she uses it for a getaway. You must see her a lot huh?’ You want to know what that clerk said to me?”

“No.” Tears fell down my face.

He took another gulp of his wine. “I’ll tell you anyway. He said, in the most annoyingly excited salesman voice, ‘Oh yeah...She’s been coming here off and on for over a year. She tips every time she comes and she just loves our room service menu.’ For over a year, right under my goddamn nose...”

His face reddened and he shook his head. “I wanted to go up there and confront them, but I knew I would’ve killed them—both of them. I can’t pretend that I don’t know anymore, Via. I can’t pretend to be happy about a baby that’s not mine, and when I got this last set of pictures today, I made up my mind... I’ve hired a lawyer and I’m telling her it’s over tonight. I just thought I would let you know the real reason why before she lied to you like she lied to me.” He banged his fist on the table.

I looked through the photos once more, hoping that my eyes were playing tricks on me, that it wasn’t really my best friend and my husband in the shots—praying that I was in some type of sick nightmare.

But the images never changed. It was true.

“Cheers to faithful spouses.” Barry poured another glass of wine and practically forced me to drink it.

That wine was disgusting, but not as disgusting as the following weeks would be...

“It’s okay, Via.” Sandra motioned for me to switch seats with her. “Let’s go home.”",1,1747674334.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

They've got a couple thousand users collectively. Not anything substantial, but sufficient to experiment with monetization.

Here's what I've learned from actually attempting to get people to pay for something I've built in my spare time.

What appears to work:

**1. Freemium with clear value on both sides**

Free plan should feel truly valuable, and paid plan should feel like an obvious upgrade. Best if your product is something users come back to again and again. Productivity, creative, anything dependent on a habit. If users don't come back, freemium is merely giving away content.



**2. Credit packs / pay-per-use**

If your app does something small or computationally intensive (like AI generations or data pulls), credit packs are perfect. I did this on one project and saw a huge difference. People don't want to subscribe to a tool that they only need once in a while, but they will happily pay $5 for a pack of uses.



**3. Lifetime deals for early traction**

This is not a long-term strategy, but for acquiring your first paying users and proof that individuals care enough to pay at all, it works. $20 or $25 one-time gets individuals in the door and often gets you better feedback too.



What didn't work:

**Ads**

Tried AdSense on low-traffic tool. Earned a few cents. Looked terrible. Scared off people. In case you don't have lots of traffic or pageviews, ads aren't worth attempting.



**Donations**

Everyone loves the concept of ""Buy me a coffee"", but donations don't come in if your product doesn't fix a passionate niche pain area. I once worked on a project that pulled in a decent amount of users, but just two people contributed.



**Subscription-only pricing**

One of my initial products released with a $5/month offering and no free plan. Practically nobody converted. I then pivoted to offering a limited free version and immediately noticed better traction. People need to perceive value initially, and then choose to pay.



**Some other things that worked:**

Email collection: I added an email subscription on a single tool and blasted out random newsletters. Not only did it maintain some users engaged, it gave me a direct pipeline when launching new features or related tools.

She was like ""what? No. You don't look autistic"" (i know this is the classic but this time this statement is even worse just keep reading) and i tried to explain myself and how autistic people doesn't have a certain ""look"" (also keep in mind my 2 other friends were taking to each other and not paying attention to us witch made me sad because they already knew I'm autistic and didn't say anything) but she got offended and told the tail we all know ""my 5 yo nephew is autistic and we knew the second he was born"" and i told her that this is impossible since autism has more to do with communication so they couldn't possibly know till he was at least 2 yo or more but she was not having it and kept arguing (i don't really remember any other detail since this was a year ago) so i faked a phone call and told them that ""they need me at the lab"" and left. 

And here comes the funny part, after that i spoke with my friend who invited her and told her that i don't ever wanna be in the same room as her cousin and she was surprised and asked me what happened since she was not paying attention during meeting. I told her everything and she was like ""wait a damn minute her brother doesn't have autism he has down syndrome?!""

1kqgwel,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chotul/comments/1kqgwel/what_are_some_unusual_tips_for_weight_loss_that/,What are some unusual tips for weight loss that worked for you?,"Regarding weight loss, some of the most effective strategies can be the ones you wouldn't expect. Here are a few of my favorite unusual (yet science-backed) tips that worked wonders for me:

# 1. Start Your Day with Fats Instead of Carbs

Instead of reaching for sugary cereals or toast in the morning, I began my day with a high-fat, low-carb breakfast like eggs and avocado or a keto coffee (blended with butter and MCT oil). This kept me full for hours and shifted my body's focus toward burning fat for energy rather than sugar. It's a sneaky way to nudge your body into fat-burning mode without much effort!

# 2. Use a Smaller Plate

This may sound simple, but psychology plays a big role in eating habits. Switching to a smaller plate naturally helped me eat less because even smaller portions looked satisfying. Over time, this trick trained me to recognize when I was full.

# 3. Practice Mindful Eating

One of my biggest struggles was eating on autopilot (hello, bag of chips in front of the TV). I started focusing on eating meals away from screens, chewing slowly, and truly savoring each bite. This reduced overeating dramatically and helped me feel more satisfied with smaller meals.

# 4. Try Intermittent Fasting

I combined intermittent fasting with a ketogenic diet, skipping breakfast a few days a week and eating within an 8-hour window. This gave my body more periods to burn fat, and I noticed reduced cravings throughout the day.

# 5. ""Out of Sight, Out of Mind"" Strategy

Crave control was a big challenge until I kept tempting, high-carb snacks out of sight of the house. At the same time, I made keto-friendly options (like cheese sticks, boiled eggs, or keto fat bombs) easy to access. This minor adjustment helped me stay on track and make better decisions.

# 6. Listen to Your Body (And Match Eating to Energy Levels)

One surprising thing I learned was that I didn't need to eat based on the clock. Instead, I started eating only when I was genuinely hungry and stopped as soon as I felt full. Sometimes, that meant skipping a meal entirely if I wasn't hungry, saving me from unnecessary calorie intake.

# Bonus Tip: Customize Your Approach

If there's one secret to making these unusual tips work, it's finding what fits *you*. That's actually why I turned to the [Custom Keto Diet Plan](https://www.ketolifestyle.us/custom-keto-diet/). The program tailored everything—from meal plans to macro goals—to my unique needs.

Here's what I loved about it:

* **No Guesswork:** Recipes, shopping lists, and daily menus are all customized to your preferences and lifestyle.
* **Backed by Science:** Expert guidance ensured I followed proven strategies without wasting time.
* **Sustainable:** With practical tips and realistic meals, it was easy to stay consistent and motivated.

Weight loss doesn't have to mean suffering or deprivation. With a mix of these unconventional strategies and a personalized plan, success is closer than you think. Start your transformation by exploring the [Custom Keto Diet Plan](https://www.ketolifestyle.us/custom-keto-diet/) and unlock your potential today.

1kqgucr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1kqgucr/am_i_overreacting_for_blocking_flirtatious/,Am I overreacting for blocking flirtatious acquaintance after he had a panic attack over my behavior?,"I’ve been single for a year, still recovering from my only two relationships not going as planned. First my fiancé who died after an accident, and more recently my long-term boyfriend who left to “find himself.” I felt burned out and jaded, dating was nowhere on my radar. I feel like that could have contributed to how this played out.

A longtime acquaintance began replying to my Instagram stories and reaching out more. We’d only exchanged the occasional friendly comment before, but suddenly he was sharing personal reflections and chatting with me daily about work and life. The attention felt good. His genuine interest and occasional flirty compliment sparked something I hadn’t expected. But I wanted to be upfront about where I was at. 

I told him I was still working on myself and he respected that, even said he admired that. After a month of steady conversation we planned to meet for coffee strictly as friends, but the chemistry was clear. I like him, but I want to heal first and not let a new romance mask unfinished grief or resentment. I worried that was what happened with my recent relationship and why it didn't pan out. My hope is we can enjoy a friendship now and, if the timing’s right see where the spark leads, without promises or pressure. I figured a friendly afternoon coffee was a great opportunity to touch on that and see how he felt about it. 

We didn't get the opportunity to get that far. 

In our recent discussions, he had brought up having anxiety, and healing over how his past relationship would trigger that it. He had briefly mentioned she would hide things from him and how it hurt their relationship, so honesty is his priority now. 

He had been messaging me pretty late into the evening and then said he didn't actually know what I did for a living. This is a sensitive topic. I work with highly vulnerable clients, so for their safety I usually just say I’m a “caseworker.” Legally, I can’t share details—leaks have cost lives.

Knowing honesty matters to him, I clarified that my job involves counseling and case management for at-risk individuals , including children and youths, but that I avoid work talk outside the office. He kept pushing for specifics I can’t give. I tried addressing the questions the best I could, or explaining why it's confidential, but it only heightened his anxiety.

He insisted I could trust him, telling me about a friend in a top-secret job who’d already spilled classified details to him as proof of his reliability. I pointed out that repeating those showed the opposit, and secrets shouldn't be used as barter. 

He then flooded me with short, rapid fire messages about how I'm giving him a panic attack and he just needed honesty. I kept explaining my limits but his pleas escalated. he wasn’t asking for client specifics, just clarity. I insisted I have given him the extent I can. He kind of just spiraled about that. And I couldn't bring myself continue it the conversation. I went silent just from the shock of how this escalated and trying to figure out how I was going to handle this.  it made him panic more. I felt sorry for him, but the pressure and entitlement when we barely knew each other gave me the ick.

Then I remembered that I don't really owe anybody anything. And I don't need to sit here through this if I don't want to. So I blocked him. And I do realize that might come off as pretty cold and uncaring, I'm not opposed to being seen as such, especially when it comes to protecting the lives of the people I am responsible for. Or protecting my own peace and sanity. 

He’s now telling our mutual circle that I provoked his panic attack, painted me as manipulative and toxic. Some closer friends think I over-reacted and should’ve soothed him.

But I’m still healing and can’t take responsibility for someone else’s anxiety. He needs to manage his own issues, just as I’m handling mine—that’s exactly why I’ve said I’m not ready for anything deeper. Mentally and emotionally, I'm not in a healthy place where I could be helpful with these situations. Frankly, I'm not sure if I even want to. I want to be healthy enough to handle my own problems, I just don't think I can take on anything further than that.

All through this time, I knew that I shouldn't develop feelings for her. Not just because I value our friendship, but also because she is a 8-year long relationship. 

Last evening, there was a party at a colleague's place. When I arrived, I saw that she was there with her boyfriend. This was the first time I'd seen him. I had not know he was going to be there. A horrible truth dawned on me when I realised I couldn't make conversation with him or even look him in the eyes for too long : I have feelings for her. For the rest of the evening, I sat in a corner by myself drinking, occasionally joining in the conversation to crack a joke but mostly keeping to myself. I hadn't gotten drunk in a long time.

*Game Time: 4:30PM PST / 7:30PM EST*



**Why This Pick?**

The Orioles just gave up 24 runs to the Washington Nationals over 3 games – I simply can’t back them to win in their current form. In addition, I don’t love either of today’s starting pitchers – both Dean Kremer (5.36 ERA) and Quinn Priester (4.59 ERA) leave a lot to be desired. Having said all of this, I think this will be a high-scoring affair – one of these squads is going to run up an early score on the weaker pitcher. The last 5 straight meetings between these two teams have seen 9 runs or more. I’m on the Over to hit here.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) What a sweep-tastic Sunday for the Los Angeles Angels. They took down their crosstown rivals, the Los Angeles Dodgers, with a 6-4 win, completing their first three-game Freeway Series sweep since 2010. The Angels, who were dwelling in the basement of the American League West before the series, must have had their morning coffee extra strong, because they came out swinging.

Zach Neto and Taylor Ward set the tone with back-to-back home runs in the first inning, and Yusei Kikuchi was dealing on the mound, striking out seven and giving up just one run on three hits over 5 2/3 innings. Unfortunately, Kikuchi's day was cut short due to a right ankle injury, but the Angels' bullpen held strong.

The Dodgers, who were tied for the best record in the majors, tried to mount a comeback, thanks to Will Smith's game-tying three-run homer in the seventh. But Travis d'Arnaud had other plans, smashing his first home run of the season in the eighth inning to put the Angels ahead for good.

Shaun Anderson earned the win with 2 2/3 innings of relief, and the Angels celebrated their first three-game sweep at Dodger Stadium in over a decade. As for the Dodgers, they suffered their first three-game sweep at home since June 2023. Ouch.

The final score: Angels 6, Dodgers 4. The Angels will look to keep their momentum going on Monday night against the Athletics, while the Dodgers will try to bounce back against the Diamondbacks. What a series, folks!

I don’t have anyone to really ask about this, or who I can vent my feelings to, so I hope I can get some feedback from the Poly Group to help me gain some perspective.

So, here’s some background, I (36 F) and been dating my boyfriend (35 M) for a little over two years. He moved into my house with me. We’ve had our ups and downs, it’s hard for me because I suffer from chronic pain and my boyfriend suffers from anxiety and depression. When we first got together my boyfriend sprang on me that he’s into ENM. I wasn’t really phased by it, but my ground rule was that I was his girlfriend, so he shouldn’t be treating the other women differently from me. I did get upset when I found out he would take them on dates – he hasn’t taken me on a date in a long time, mostly to save money. I admit, it had me upset, I cook, clean, work hard, take care of the house and yard, and the animals and I don’t get the have “fun dates” or the “carefree” boyfriend they do. So I got angry, and the dating stopped. I felt bad about it and I felt like I was one who messed stuff up.

A few months ago, I voiced I was unhappy. I felt lonely and unwanted because I couldn’t get my boyfriend to engage with me. He tends to talk over me when I try to have a conversation and I just end up shutting down (he thinks if he talks loud enough or interrupts first he ""wins"" the conversation - he claims it was from when he worked in a law office and would go to court with the lawyers) I would try to barter with him to spend some time with me or to do something close to me in the house, so I wouldn’t feel alone. My boyfriend has his own setup in the basement, including a bed for when he has trouble sleeping, which is always, so I can go a whole day without seeing him outside of when I make dinner. My boyfriend told me to find someone who could fill that emotional need.

So, I did…..which was a huge mistake. I met a nice quiet man who enjoyed playing bored games, chilling, and we did fool around once – but he wasn’t for me, he was nice, just not someone I would want to date long term. My boyfriend became jealous and moody. It ultimately blew up when he got drunk and decided to plant a recording device in the house so he could hear me talk to myself and the dogs as I cleaned in prep for friends coming over. We decided that my boyfriend couldn’t handle me being in an ENM relationship because he gets too jealous. He promised to go to rehab, stop his drinking, and see a counsellor about his anger/jealousy. So, I broke it off with the guy I was seeing and deleted all of the apps. Well fast forward 4 months and here we are.

And where is here: Well, my boyfriend has thankfully stopped drinking and is getting things in order, but he wants to pursue an ENM relationship with an old friend of his. We were enjoying a joint out on the deck after fooling around, which was really nice because he gets anxious or hyper focused so the physical element of our relationship isn’t as intense as I would like so when we can be together it’s fun and I enjoy it – he also doesn’t like to sleep next to anyone, so I miss being near another person. He decided to bring up the topic of returning to the ENM lifestyle. Again, I was okay with it, but over the last week I’ve started to dread it, and I feel like I’m shutting down.

 My boyfriend will not stop talking about this woman. He brushes it off saying they were old friends and worked together, and now they’re catching up on old times and comparing notes – he video calls her for a least 2 hours everyday. Which is hard for me honestly. My boyfriend “jokes” about negotiating time to spend with me each week. A few weeks ago, he promised me 2 hours of uninterrupted one-on-one time during the week. Well, that never happened. His idea of spending time together is if I go to the basement (not the living room or kitchen) and sit on his bed while he plays video games and smokes weed OR we watch a movie or tv show that he wants to (he doesn’t like my taste in movies/shows so he won’t watch them – he will  on occasion if he knows I need some “love”).

My boyfriend has explained (let's call his other/new girlfriend Emma( Emma is in an ENM relationship with her husband (both happily married with a little one) and they both have plenty of “friends” – my boyfriend said Emma has a harem of men. I was feeling kind of self conscious at this point – I’m not everyone’s cup of tea in the way I look and I’m on the autism spectrum – so I asked if I could see a photo of her. Which was an even bigger mistake – Emma is beautiful, tiny, thin, with great skin, and a gorgeous smile. He’s told me how she’s given him advice on how to make sure I don’t feel jealous (apparently if you give your partner some extra affection like a housecat then they’ll be okay). I’m also not super happy that they’ve been exchanging intimate information about each other partners. My boyfriend told Emma a story about me that makes me embarrassed. He thought it was hilarious and couldn’t seem to understand why I would be upset he told Emma bout it.

My boyfriend and Emma have been spending lots of time together and even planned a full day date early next week. I feel so numb and out of it not just because of my boyfriend starting this new relationship, but also because my boyfriend’s dog attacked and mauled my small dog. My boyfriends dog tried to rip out the throat of my dog. 3 hours at the emergency vet, emergency surgery, me crying by myself (because my boyfriend was on a date with Emma), and a 4-figure vet bill later saw me at home feeling abandoned. My boyfriend has gone out on 3 dates with Emma this last week and is prepping for their big date next week. Meanwhile I’m going back and forth to the vet each day with my dog to have his bandages changed and vitals reviewed, cleaning, cooking, and basically feeling like a servant. My boyfriend said he’ll take me on a date on Monday, but I won’t hold my breath – he’ll make an excuse like he always does (he’ll probably want to clean up the space in the basement more for when Emma comes over).

So, that’s about it. I feel unwanted, and honestly alone and unloved. I feel like everything I have done over the last two years means nothing – helping my boyfriend get his GED, get into university, hold down a secure job, help him with an active lifestyle, and ensure he’s eating properly. Emma gets to walk back into his life after 10 years, pick up like nothing has changed, and she gets to benefit from the hard work I’ve put in, and she get’s the “fun boyfriend” – I get the boyfriend who has anxiety attacks and freezes, whose depression gets so bad he won’t get out of bed, having to clean up after him, and cook for him (he can’t cook and refuses to learn – which sucks when I have a flare up or I’m sick because I still have to cook).

 

As I’m writing this out, I’m seeing things that are just so messed up and I’m thinking I already the know the answer. Basically, I was going to ask if this is normal behaviour…but I can already tell it’s not. Am I the problem? Do I need to communicate more? I already feel like a nag, and I feel like some of this stuff shouldn’t need to be said out loud – like isn’t it common sense to treat your main partner the best, to not tell humiliating storied about them, and to spend more time with them then the side-person you’re seeing. Is my boyfriend engaging in poly behaviour or is this just a way for him to sleep with however he wants, have relationships with however he wants, and still be able to come home to maid service?  I feel like everything is so unfair. My boyfriend has, and still occasionally, called me a “cheater” because of the 3 dates I went on with the guy I broke up with even though my boyfriend knew about everything and gave his permission, but I feel like my boyfriend is the cheater – he seems to be having a super deep emotional relationship with Emma, he makes time for her (even drops his videogames for her), he takes her on dates (coffee dates so far, but I would really love to be taken on a coffee date or anything really), talks to her for hours (he asks me to be quiet because he prefer to “sit in silence”), he’s even planned to go to the sex clinic and get tested for her (we’ve been together for 2 years and I get regular tests/exams because I’m immunocompromised) and finally pick up his Viagra prescription from the pharmacy in time for their date (they’re “too expensive” to always have on hand….which is also why our sex life isn’t the mot vibrant).

I hope you guys come out and say I’m crazy and to get over it, because I know I’ll hate the “you’re right” comments too much. I think he’s cheating and not really into ENM. I think Emma might legit also be cheating – she’s been putting off her harem of men, her husband, and child to spend extra time with my boyfriend, talk with him daily, and even plan a full day together (thoughts on this theory? I don’t know how she has energy for that many people!). And I think I’m unhappy living with a man-child who doesn’t seem to actually care about me and is instead using me.

1kqgipi,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1kqgipi/imagebuddies_a_selfhosted_userfriendly_ui_for/,"ImageBuddies: A self-hosted, user-friendly UI for OpenAI image generation","Hey everyone!

I'm excited to share a project I've been working on: [ImageBuddies](https://github.com/Fizzyy89/ImageBuddies)!

[The generation interface](https://preview.redd.it/jzi6h1jbor1f1.png?width=1465&format=png&auto=webp&s=179b976f4f639cfd528a8b6df17886216c48be54)

It's a web interface that lets you and your friends or a small team easily generate images using OpenAI's models (like `gpt-image-1`) without everyone needing their own OpenAI account or dealing with complex setups. You can self-host it on any webspace with PHP support – no database needed!

**Why did I build this?**

My goal was to build an easy-to-use, shared platform for creative image generation. It enables groups to collaborate using one common API key, providing clear cost control – perfect for sharing expenses and bypassing the need for individual accounts or subscriptions for everyone involved.

**✨ Key Features:**

* **🚀 Easy to Host**: Focus on simplicity, the only requirement is PHP.
* **🤖 OpenAI Integration**: Generate images, edit existing ones with prompts, and even use an automatic prompt optimization feature.
* **👥 User Management**: Admin interface, user roles (admin/user), and a secure login.
* **🖼️ Image Generation & Customization**:
   * Intuitive prompt interface.
   * Support for up to 8 reference images (upload, paste, drag & drop).
   * Choose aspect ratios (1:1, 2:3, 3:2).
   * Select image quality (low, medium, high) with estimated cost display.
   * Generate 1-4 image variations per request.
   * Dynamic cost estimation *before* you generate.
* **📸 Gallery & Image Viewing**:
   * Gallery for all generated images (filterable by ""all"" or ""my images"").
   * Compact and normal grid views.
   * Lightbox with metadata (prompt, user, date, quality, etc.).
   * Mark images as private.
   * Download individual images or batches as ZIP.
   * Easily copy image URLs or reuse settings.
   * Set any image in a batch as the main thumbnail.

[The gallery view of all generated images](https://preview.redd.it/5a52i73for1f1.png?width=1476&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c4d246c7b4cc05d18ba3fe54cd31be2599ddbe9)

* **⚙️ Admin Controls**: Customize site name, headlines, features list, footer, API key management, view-only mode, and more.
* **📊 Usage Statistics (Admin-only)**: Track costs, images generated, distributions by quality/user, and much more.
* **💫 Modern UI**: Clean, responsive (Tailwind CSS), Dark/Light mode, mobile-friendly, and multi-language support (EN/DE for now).

**👥 Who is it for?**

* **Friend Groups**: Share an API key and generate images together.
* **Small Teams**: Collaborate on visual projects.
* **Individuals**: A personal, self-hosted alternative to other UIs.

[Images open in a beautiful lightbox, that offers all the features you need](https://preview.redd.it/4peq6w6gor1f1.png?width=1884&format=png&auto=webp&s=bafd37beb48ed4d5baca11468a1fb41ee55d8ff0)

**🔧 Technical Overview:**

* **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), Vanilla JavaScript.
* **Backend**: PHP.
* **Storage**: Images on the server, user data/settings in JSON files, metadata in CSVs. API key in a `.env` file.

**⚠️ Important Security Notice:**

ImageBuddies is primarily for **controlled environments**. The default setup prioritizes ease of installation. If deploying on a **publicly accessible server**, please ensure you secure the `/database` directory (which contains your API key!). There's an `.htaccess` for Apache, but for Nginx/IIS etc., you'll need to configure this manually. Your server security is your responsibility.

**🔧 Getting Started:**

1. Read the Security Notice on GitHub.
2. Download from GitHub.
3. Upload to your PHP webspace.
4. Follow the on-screen setup (create admin, enter API key).
5. Login and start generating!

1kqgc3t,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1kqgc3t/aita_for_making_my_coworkers_watch_me_having/,AITA - For making my coworkers watch me having Migraines,"Throwaway account, I'll be as honest as possible. I'm 27, German, sorry for spelling, etc., have been dealing with weekly headaches and occasional migraines for around 5 years. I’ve learned how to manage them to some degree, but I’ve rarely been able to stop one once it’s approaching.

I began working at my current job a few months ago. I had been honest about my migraines and bonded over that with a coworker who had similar experiences. Everyone seemed very understanding. Especially during sick days. Even my boss was fine and understanding.

This past Friday, migraine hit as I was going to work, not too far from where I live. My vision blurry, felt the migraine coming fast. I was right in front of work, but couldn't move. Leaned against a tree, called my job, explained to a coworker where I was and what was happening. They acknowledged it, they'd inform the others, and wished me well. 7:58am

Had to throw up, which always happens with my migraines. To calm down and gather myself, didn't move, but started feeling uncomfortable as people walked by, especially those linked to my job. Didn't want them to see me like that or worry.

Kind lady working in the building across from my job offered to get me something to drink (Coffee). Head was pounding, nauseous, no balance. Tree kept me steady.

8:17am almost finished the drink, felt slightly better so I crossed the road to form distance from my job.

Remembered I wanted to ask my boss something important before they left for holiday. In hindsight, call or email would’ve worked, but I wasn’t thinking clearly. Forced myself to walk in, briefly asked and left. I still had the coffee mug, so I returned it to the woman across the street. As I left her building, my sibling arrived to take me home.

Today (Monday), a kitchen coworker approached me. They’d seen me Friday and said they were unsure what to do. They’d been told I had a migraine and said that I should've just gone home or come into work and sit in one of the rooms until I felt better. I informed them that my moving there was my first moment where I felt like I could move and it was only like less than 10 meters, and I didn't really intend to come inside and make even more people see me like that

They then continued how awful and concerned I made them feel by making them see me having migraines. How it affects others at work, especially when I get sick in the bathroom. They added they’re glad they don’t really see that since they’re in the kitchen. No one’s ever said anything like this to me before. And I wondered, wouldn't I still confront them with it, if I had actually gone inside?

Obviously, I don't have migraines for fun.  
But it still made me wonder and consider about things I can do better, which I'm sure there are. I also want to talk to my boss again once they are back, but... AITA?

It works fine for my issues (sleep apnea, insomnia, circadian rhythm disorders, etc).
However, the first few hours after dosing have makrked jitteryness (no more than excess coffee) and sweating, and with warm weather coming, the sweating is worse (and embarrassing at work).
I'm considering cutting the single 150 dose to 2 75mg doses (1st upon waking, 2nd about 4 hours later, ex: 7:00am > 11:00am).
Does anyone else split their dose and have you found it a) still effective throughout the day and b) less sweaty? 

(Relevant info: I use Trazadone in the evening (about 10:00pm) to smooth out my sleep cycle (not falling asleep sooner, but staying under longer, ex 6+ hours instead of 3-4 (which was happening even before I started NuVigi.)

Like, one of those gallon jugs that looks more like camping gear than a drink. I used to tease him about it at family barbecues:

**“What are you training for, a desert hike?”**

But he just laughed and said it helped him feel less tired during the day.

Anyway, a few months ago, he switched jobs and started working at a small insurance firm in Columbus, Ohio. His coworkers noticed the jug on his first day and gave him a hard time—same jokes I used to make.

**The Unexpected Ripple Effect**

A few weeks go by, and something weird happens: one by one, people in his office start showing up with bigger water bottles. First it was a 32 oz tumbler, then someone brought in one of those color-marked “motivation bottles,” and before long, the office fridge was full of lemon slices and mint leaves.

Jason didn’t say anything. He didn’t push anyone or make a challenge out of it. But people saw how energized he was in the afternoon, how he didn’t crash after lunch, and they started asking questions. He just told them the truth:

**“I drink a lot of water, and I feel better. That’s all.”**

**Small Habits, Big Changes**

Now, months later, it’s a full-on culture shift at his office. They even replaced the old coffee pot with one of those fancy hot/cold filtered water dispensers.

**He told me last week:**

“All I did was drink water and mind my business. I didn’t expect to start a trend.”

**Why This Stuck with Me**

It reminded me how simple habits—when done consistently—can quietly influence people around you. No pressure, no preaching. Just consistency.

Jason didn’t set out to inspire anyone. But he did, just by showing up every day with that ridiculous jug and doing what worked for him.

Persephone de Cordova acclimated to gloomy Seattle weather almost immediately as she had never been fond of California sunshine and hot weather; she was the antithesis of other natives who longed to frolic on the beach and go camping to be one with nature. Persephone always thought ahead to where she'd be dealing with bright-red sunburns on her fair skin, excessive sweaty episodes and mosquito bites.

No, thank you.

Which is why Seattle was an ideal place for her to move when she bought a lottery scratcher from an automated machine inside her local drugstore and saw that she won the grand prize of twenty million dollars. After paying taxes on the winnings, she decided to buy a modest home and invest the majority. She kept a reasonable portion in her savings account in case of emergencies but her previous profession had cushioned her financial situation quite nicely.

On this Friday morning, she met with her financial advisor to discuss the best investment opportunities. A few million of the lottery winnings were already gone thanks to taxes, as well as the purchase and furnishing of her home. She was very much aware the impact of inflation could have on her savings in the future, hence why she opted to take a proactive stance.

By eight-thirty in the morning Persephone walked out of the advisor's office with the intention of getting back in her car and driving home but a passerby walked past her holding a very fragrant drink that smelled of coffee and something else she couldn't quite place but made her mouth water just the same.

For a split second, she considered letting the situation be but her caffeine addiction prompted her towards him. ""Excuse me,"" she called out to the young man holding the drink.

The stylish man wore glasses and had curly black hair atop his head which was painstakingly coiffed to get a perfect result. He halted and turned to look at her.

""I am so sorry to bother you,"" she placed her hands over her heart, ""But that drink smells so good. May I ask what it is and where you got it from?""

The young man smiled at her. ""Oh, no problem, mami,"" he said in a friendly tone. He pointed across the street. ""There's a coffee shop on the corner there called A Steamy Love Affair,"" he pointed to his drink. ""Ask for Unexpected Love,"" he suggested. He waved his hand dramatically over his coffee cup. ""Lavender and vanilla. I tried it three years ago and I have been hooked ever since.""

Persephone smiled at the young man, ""Thank you for that,"" she told him as she made her way to the business. ""Have a great day!"" She yelled out.

""You too, mami!"" she heard him respond.

The shop itself was small but it was crammed to the brim with seating areas for customers, all of which were taken. The smell of freshly made coffee immediately invaded her senses and made her mouth water. She practically floated to the register to place her order.

As soon as that was done she noticed two professional-looking men were vacating a table that was part of a running built-in bench. Persephone made a beeline towards the newly available table and placed her clutch on the surface. Once the table was claimed she began to undo the fastenings of her black coat. So many people breathing in this small space was making the locale rather warm for her taste.

Once the coat was on top of the bench, she stood in a solid black sheath dress with a plunging neckline feeling more at ease. She noticed a few spills on the table likely courtesy of the previous inhabitants. Persephone reached towards the napkin dispenser for a napkin and wiped the spills.

""Ah- you have bested me.""

She heard as she wiped. Slowly, she looked up to see the deepest blue eyes she had ever seen staring back at her. They came with a handsome male face that seemed to have been kissed perfectly by the sun. The lean chiseled face was framed with short hair, left a little long on top and brushed back.

""I'm sorry?"" Persephone uttered as she stared, not realizing she was openly admiring the face staring back at her.

""Unexpected Love for Persephone!"" The barista shouted from behind the counter finally bringing her out of the spell.

# Three People, One Table

""That's my drink,"" Persephone said softly. ""Excuse me."" She tried brushing past him - which was not an easy feat being surrounded by furniture and other patrons. They made direct eye contact as their bodies came into contact with each other.

Persephone inhaled sharply at the proximity of this man catching a profound whiff full of his cologne. ""You smell really good."" She told him, as she pushed against him to get through.

She reached the counter for the steaming cup of coffee and walked back to her table.

The handsome stranger was still there ushering people away from her table.

""Thank you,"" she said as she sat down on the cushioned green-colored padded bench.

""Don't mention it,"" he said with a half-smile and a twinkle in his eye before walking away.

Persephone had intended to invite him to share a table, but he left before she so much as opened her mouth. Unwillingly, her gaze remained on him- following him as he made his way to the end of the line.

""Excuse me, Miss?"" She heard a soft feminine voice coming from the right.

Persephone turned to the sound. A woman in her 60's stood above her. She had shoulder-length white hair and a gracefully aged gentle face with the kindest light-blue eyes looking back at her. For a fleeting moment, Persephone had the distinct feeling she knew her but quickly brushed the thought away. After all, she hadn't been in Seattle very long, and she had not had time to acquaint herself with anyone other than the financial advisor she just met with.

""Hi,"" Persephone responded, knowing she looked a little perplexed. ""May I help you with something?""

""Do you mind sharing your table?"" The woman asked at once. ""Unless you're expecting company?""

Persephone motioned to the wooden chair across from her. ""I'll save it for you after you've placed your order.""

The woman quickly removed her raincoat and placed it on the back of the chair, however, the next move surprised Persephone. The woman came behind the table and sat her slightly rounded body next to Persephone on the padded bench.

""I'm meeting someone- my order is being taken care of as we speak,"" she pointed to the baristas and quickly looked back at Persephone. ""You don't mind if someone else joins us, right? Seeing that there are two extra chairs and all,"" she motioned across from them.

Persephone's eyes followed the motion. ""Of course not,"" she said jovially. ""I'm not staying very long."" She took a cautionary sip of her drink only to find it too hot for her taste. Definitely delicious- but still very hot.

""Heading to work?"" The matronly woman asked.

Persephone shook her head as she grabbed a napkin and gently dabbed her lips. ""No - just anxious to get home.""

""Oh dear,"" the woman covered her mouth with her right hand. ""I hope it isn't because of my intrusion?"" The woman tried to stand but had a little difficulty.

Persephone quickly placed her hand on the woman's arm as if to halt the movement. ""No!"" She exclaimed. ""That's not it at all,"" she reassured her. ""I'm new to Seattle, I meant to go home, rest a little and then get lost in the city to familiarize myself with it.""

""Aunt Micaela!"" A voice boomed near them.

Persephone turned to her left, only to find the handsome man with the deep blue eyes staring down at the woman sitting next to her. He placed two cardboard cups on the table.

""Hello, my love!"" Persephone noticed this time around the older woman managed to stand with ease. She walked to kiss the man on the cheek, then turned her attention back to Persephone with a huge smile. ""I'd like you to meet my godson, Chris Ericson.",1,1747672572.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

I'm 34, based in NYC, and honestly just looking to make more solid male friendships. I'm into the gym (nothing crazy, just trying to stay consistent), coffee, good food, and cocktails. Would love to find some like-minded guys to chat with, maybe even hang with if we're local.

Big preference for voice chatting — I just think it's the best way to actually feel someone's vibe. If you're not down for that, no hard feelings, but probably not the right fit.

[**Retro Film Series — School in the Crosshairs**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/retro-film-series-school-in-the-crosshairs/) at **Carolina Theatre**  


* Genre master Nobuhiko Ôbayashi is best known for 1977’s “Hausu,” and this 1981 fantasy is filled with his trademark analog special effects and camera tricks, though this time supported by a stronger main story with a well-developed central character, a notable departure from “Hausu.”
* Hiroko Yakushimaru stars as Yuko, a high school girl who must defend her school from an extraterrestrial attack. A new transfer student is using her psychic abilities to transform their school into a conformist, almost fascistic staging area for an alien takeover of the Earth, while coercing her classmates into going along. Discovering her own latent telekinetic abilities, Yuko teams up with Koji, her budding boyfriend from the kendo club, to fight off the invaders. The special effects-heavy finale – a battle between Yuko and Kyogoku, the demon-like extraterrestrial being who has set his sights on the school – manages to outdo “Hausu” in its wild, brain-melting unbelievability. It’s also a brilliant statement about conformity and free thought, most likely aimed by Obayashi at Japanese society in general and the film industry in particular. Despite having been remade over and over as a television series, animation, and other live-action films, it’s Obayashi’s version that is considered the best by Japanese critics and fans.

* The exhibition includes a selection of plein air works from his native North Carolina and abroad, as well as large-scale paintings which explore the impact humans are having on the natural world. In these paintings, Keul includes figures, both adults and children, to invite us to consider how our actions will impact future generations.
* Keul values art not only for its own sake, but also as a meditative practice which has guided his life. “Having had an unconventional adolescence, flying back and forth between parents and coasts, and being sent, at age 16, to a therapeutic boarding school in Western Samoa, art has been true north on my life’s compass, helping to guide me through some turbulent events and teaching me the value of patience, perseverance, and humility” he says.
* Keul’s work can be found in important public and private collections around the world. As an educator committed to empowering the next generation of artists, he will be teaching a group of Savannah College of Art and Design students at their campus in Lacoste, France this summer.

1kqfycu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychosis/comments/1kqfycu/potential_for_a_great_friendship_ruined_by_a/,Potential for a great friendship ruined by a delusion,"TL;DR
I finally found a friend who ""gets it"" when it comes to stigmatized mental health issues. Wound up with a delusion that she was interested in me even though I wanted to be friends. Now we can't be friends because I had that delusion.


I should start this by saying that I've never had a ""true"" delusion. I've only had ones where I'm aware that they don't add up, but feel 100% emotionally that they are true. It always goes away when I'm given evidence that it isn't true. But this one is a little worse bc I still believe it.

So I met someone and got their Instagram. She had lots of vulnerable posts about her mental health and I had heard previously from others that she had the one of the same disorders that I did. I reached out about an issue, received no response, and shortly afterwards saw a post ""clearly referring to a romantic interest in me"". I saw another ""clear reference"" to me a week later, so I messaged in reference to it, and saying I needed a explicit yes/no response (instead of vague social media posts) because I had poor reality testing.  Honestly, I wasn't really interested but I wanted an excuse to make friends. She really isn't my type.

She actually responded this time, but she responded to my original message, ignoring my question about her interest in me. We got to talking about mental health, and it turns out that she had some serious mental health issues like I do. It was only one conversation, but it was very humanizing for me and presumably her as well. No mention of any romantic interest or anything, which was a good thing to me.

She does make a post the next day though, with the caption ""ANIMALS EAT ANIMALS. ANIMALS FUCK ANIMALS. DO I HAVE TO SPELL IT OUT TO YOU?"". Again, I'm fucking confused but I interpreted it as the ""explicit answer"" I asked for. Like it's weird but I didn't expect her to be normal so it didn't bother me much. In hindsight it must have been a coincidence though.

I asked her to get coffee once or twice but deleted the messages out of embarrassment since I got no response. I finally messaged her not to worry about me while she was transitioning to her new job, but she could give me updates on anything exciting. Also mentioned that I cried over my whole lunch break on the first day of my last job.

She made a post about her new job, emphasizing multiple times that she was on her break. Next day, she posts like 10 memes on her story, which ""clearly"" tell me to ask her on a date. This is fucking weird to me, but I do it. I try several times but get no response (and then delete out of embarrassment, bc no response). Later that night, she makes a post showing movie tickets with her friend, plus all sorts of memes/songs about lying and breaking hearts and vampires.

Just like the other posts, this ""clearly referred to me"". I believed she had intentionally tried to break my heart. I wasn't heartbroken, but I had intended to let her ""shoot her shot"" before she realized she wasn't into me. But the betrayal hurt me so so much regardless of why.

I got over it, sort of. Half a week later, after seeing my therapist, I decide to send her a message forgiving her and letting her know that ""what she did"" was terrible, but I understand what it's like to make bad decisions. I don't take it personally, so you don't have to feel guilty/embarrassed for the next 20 years. We can still be friends if you want to.

She was utterly fucking confused. She responded with genuine compassion (she has had similar experiences before), saying that she doesn't judge me and such. I thank her for her understanding and I explained what I think she did (but not in entirety bc it's long). She said that again that she doesn't judge me, but for both our safety that she will have to block me.

I'm so sad about this. Anytime I try to explain to a friend something that I KNOW is irrational, or if I KNOW doesn't completely check out, or simply that doesn't make sense to them, I receive only judgement and/or unwillingness to hear me out. (Or sometimes they encourage me even if I tell them I need a ""no"" from them).

This was the one friend I could make that WOULD'NT and DIDN'T do this.

But I can't be friends with her because she was the target of my delusion. I wanted to be friends much more than I wanted a relationship. A simple ""no"" when I asked the first time is all it would have taken to make the delusion go away.

The terrible part is that it is still totally safe for us to be friends. I wasn't into her prior to this, and I'm a safe person who can respect boundaries. I've had similar situations with already-close female friends. Those went away and we stayed close friends.

As I've typed this out, I still believe my delusion was logical (plenty of stuff not included in here). But her response on her message points to the contrary. So idk what's going on anyways.

So yeah, as the start of this post says, I think this is the first time I've been psychotic. Is it possible for my memories to be altered in hindsight to fit my delusion? All the people (like 3) I've explained it to (before this incident, which like just happened) seemed to agree with my logic, for some reason.

It's been a while, hasn't it? Almost a decade later, I still think back to the potential we had. The sparks that simmered over years of coffee catch ups and walks between campus. The week where it all overtook us, where we were so much more and then so much less, in less than a heartbeat. 

We've both moved on, we haven't even spoken in years. But what makes me think of you are those moments of quiet, where the world seems to just relax and every detail seems vibrant and new. The excitement, the butterflies, my thoughts chasing the smallest of touches.

Just out here gauging interest for 1–2 potential new players for our tabletop RPG group. I’m hoping this post reaches folks who are genuinely interested in giving it a shot!

A bit about us:
We’re all in our late 20s to early 30s, and we have a lot of love and passion for TTRPGs. We’re a laid-back and welcoming group that values inclusivity and open-mindedness. Respect and healthy boundaries are important to us—we know everyone has lives, responsibilities, and relationships outside the table. We use this game to enrich our lives, and we try to keep it fun, collaborative, and meaningful.

Our expectations:
We’re looking for individuals who share those values—someone respectful, thoughtful, and open to building connections. We appreciate curiosity, a willingness to learn, and an interest in making new friends.

We know everyone carries some baggage, and that’s human. But we do expect honest, open communication—especially if something is affecting the group dynamic, either in or out of game. We want to be able to support one another and keep the table feeling good for everyone.

We’re not power gamers or “elitists”. We lean heavily toward narrative and world-building, with a big focus on characters, story, and group cohesion.

Who we’re looking for:

Though all are welcome, We’re especially interested in newer or less experienced players—folks who are just starting out or still finding their groove in the hobby. If you’ve always wanted to try Starfinder or Pathfinder but felt intimidated by the rules or the community, we’d love to help you get started.

What we can provide:

A welcoming group of players who care about the game, the world, and the people at the table. We’re invested in collaborative storytelling and aim to create a space where everyone feels encouraged to contribute and have a great time. Whether you’re new to the system or a seasoned player, what matters most to us is how we play together.

Where we’re at currently:

We’re on hiatus right now and using this time to meet and chat with a few potential players. We’d love to set up a casual coffee meet-up or a Discord video call to break the ice and get to know each other a bit before jumping into a game.

Schedule & System:

We typically play 2 times a month, usually on Tuesdays or Wednesdays from 5–6pm to 10–11pm.
We’re based in the Richmond/Burnaby area.

We’re planning to start a Starfinder campaign—a sci-fi/fantasy blend—but we’re also open to switching to Pathfinder(a more classic fantasy rpg)  if that’s the group’s preference.

We’re aiming to kick things off around mid-July.

If this sounds like something you’d enjoy, feel free to reach out! We’d love to connect and see if it’s a good fit.

I'm learning to cook: for myself & developing flavor profiles. still-husband was the cook and I'm the baker - just how that worked for us. we have two different palettes: mine being the more adventurous and diverse of the two. 

I made a new spice blend for this dish: Sichuan peppercorns, coffee beans, and msg. *soooo good* 

dry rubbed the ctc powder, then dry rubbed the new spice blend on top. dripped some fresh lime on top. let that sit for a few. when it went into the pan I then drizzled some of the hoisin & hot sauce on top with fish sauce poured into the grill pan for additional moisture & flavor. covered & cooked on medium heat. i added little bits of water as needed to prevent burning & stuff. 

the eggs & butter went away. I subbed in black beans cooked with chicken bouillon with chia seeds & hemp hearts for added nutrition.
