Don't know if that makes sense. 

So far I'm going to get him some pjs for doing night shift, but can't think of anything else on that theme. A coffee machine for staying awake would have worked but he doesn't drink coffee. Is there anything else that might be useful for a first time dad?",2,1735668593.0,Gifts,1,1.0,False

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're looking to enhance your outdoor gatherings, consider adding a coffee table fire pit propane to your space. This versatile piece of furniture combines functionality with aesthetics, making it an excellent choice for entertaining friends and family. Let’s explore the myriad benefits that come with incorporating this outdoor feature into your patio, deck, or backyard.

### Warmth and Comfort

One of the main attractions of a coffee table fire pit propane is the warmth it provides. As the sun sets, temperatures often drop, and having a source of heat helps keep your guests comfortable. This means you can enjoy long evenings outside, chatting and sharing stories around the flickering flames. It's an inviting atmosphere that encourages everyone to stick around a little longer.

### Setting the Mood

The ambiance created by a fire pit is unparalleled. The gentle glow of the flames offers an intimate setting that traditional lighting simply can't match. You can easily set a romantic mood for date nights or create a cozy gathering space for friends. The dancing flames draw people in, making it a natural focal point for conversations.

### Versatile Design

Coffee table fire pit propane units come in a variety of styles and designs to suit your personal taste and outdoor decor. Whether you prefer modern or rustic looks, there's a fire pit that fits perfectly with your existing furniture. Some models even include additional features such as a cover, allowing them to serve dual purposes as a coffee table and a fire pit. This versatility makes them a smart choice for smaller outdoor spaces.

### Easy to Use

Using a propane fire pit is incredibly convenient. With a simple switch or button, you can ignite the flames in seconds—no need for kindling or matches. Unlike wood-burning fire pits, propane models do not produce smoke, ash, or soot, making cleanup a breeze. This means more time enjoying your fire and less time worrying about maintenance.

### Safety Features

Propane fire pits come equipped with various safety features to give you peace of mind. Many have flame-resistant screens to prevent sparks from escaping and adjustable flames for safe heat levels. Additionally, since propane is cleaner burning than wood, there's less risk of hazardous emissions. Always ensure to follow safety guidelines and maintain your fire pit for optimal use.

#### Cost-Effective Outdoor Heating

Using a coffee table fire pit propane for outdoor heating can be cost-effective. Propane is generally less expensive than electric heating options, and since propane fires can be managed easily, you can control fuel consumption better than traditional wood fires. This means you're only using fuel when necessary, potentially reducing your overall heating costs.

It can also be a great space for roasting marshmallows or making s'mores, adding a fun element to your gatherings. A fire pit can transform ordinary meals into memorable experiences.

#### Social Hub

Gathering around a fire pit naturally invites conversation and interaction. The warm glow creates a welcoming environment where everyone feels comfortable. Whether you’re hosting a birthday party, a family reunion, or just a casual get-together, a coffee table fire pit encourages bonding and camaraderie among guests.

I (59m) opened the door this evening to my Daughter-In-Law in shambles and tears. The story she told me was absolutely horrid. It made me want to disown my son. 

He was at a New Year's Eve lunch, and came back. While my daughter-in-law was having coffee, he just told her that the change of times had made him frisky, and that he wanted to take it to the bedroom. She said she wasn't in the mood, and wanted to reflect on the year that had passed. He got annoyed and went to the bedroom, she followed him. While he was changing, he took his underpants off and asked her again, she just joked and said ""Looks good, but not right now"", at that point, he held her and soon she lost control of the situation. 

This is the part where it got absolutely horrific. As he unclothed her and went in, she was naturally dry. Forcing himself in and going in and out over and over, the friction hurt him, and in anger he slapped her. Then it happened. Aggressively thrusting in her and pulling out, his foreskin got ripped off. He screamed apparently, and my daughter-in-law just pulled it out in disgust. She ran out of the house and came straight for my place (her own parents live far away).

I was disgusted with everything my 'son' had done. I feel horrible for raising such a person. I don't know what went wrong, or if there was something I could have done to prevent him from becoming like this or any other incidents before this when I could have intervened and beat his ass. 

Sometime later, he called me, saying that he ""accidentally got hurt"" and needed my help. I just told him, ""Call a doctor, not me. Justice has its own way of cutting deep."" Then I promptly hung up the phone.

I built the island from scratch in the overworld except for the museum which I fully built out in the Nether, which was somewhat complicated as I had to figure out how to add water in the Nether.

It was a ton of work but super fun trying to get the feel of Animal Crossing in Minecraft.  This island is based off the original layout of my own island before terraforming it.  I hope other people will enjoy a glimpse into this crazy project.

So my roommate (33F) made friends with a detective (44M) working on her assault/ domestic case 

They were speaking over his company provided email friendly and with him asking her out for coffee and speaking about his other cases. And saying how he looked up her profile on the po database???? His coworkers all joke about their relationship 

Now she has him over (in uniform!) and I’m uncomfortable with this whole situation. 

Is this normal? Shouldn’t he only be in uniform when working/ going to work?

My dad and I have had a running joke for years about the ""[my last name] luck"". I'll probably still go sit outside for a while. Maybe smoke the last joint I've got, the one that I want to be my last one for a long while. I haven't really wanted to lately, anyway- I did have a gummy last night, but it was more for the headache than anything else. And not smoking anymore, that'll be another small change, another thing I can do to be healthier. 

It only started in mid-August. At my friend's engagement party, when it was offered, and it seemed like a great way to focus on something other than what a trainwreck my personal life was at that point. And then I kept doing it, kept wanting to focus on something else. But I'm ready to leave that behind now, going back to only being a social smoker, with the occasional vape pulls in the evening once I've done my important tasks for the day. It was a crutch, in a sense, but one I definitely don't need anymore. 

I ended up waiting, to shower. I've been trying to care for my hair a little more, too. It'll look different, I think, next time you see me. I figured out it's closer to my dad and sister's hair texture than I thought, I just wasn't doing it right. 

Today is shaping up to be a nice self-care day for me. I think, after my appointment, I'll go to the cafe, have a snack and a coffee and read a book until it's time to go get my nails done. 

Easy, quiet day. Not productive, sure, but a nice little regroup, treating myself kindly in light of the disappointment of spending tonight alone. 

I smiled to myself, too, reading about how you're taking care of yourself, too. How you've been smiling more lately. How you've been seeing your friends.

I'm visiting a friend for their wedding in India in a couple months from the US. 

When they came over last year they liked my breville barista express setup and the drinks I made for them. I want to gift them an espresso setup as a gift as I know they don't own one and frequent coffee shops instead.

I understand there is an electrical voltage difference and the one I can buy here won't work in India? I'm looking for suggestions on both machines and sellers so that I can buy online in advance and have it delivered the week of the wedding.",2,1735667648.0,IndiaCoffee,1,1.0,False

And a dios, it’s literally an extreme sport being a pedestrian where everyday i risk my life to walk to get a coffee, or go to the park

These drivers need to be held accountable for blowing through stop signs, ignoring pedestrian crossings, and intimidating pedestrians in general. On my walk this AM i was almost hit by a Vespa and SUV. 

Do we want to continue being the 2nd most dangerous state for pedestrians? Or will we do something about it? 

There have been some improvements, but I feel awful
for young families just trying to walk around as it’s a liability to be a bipedal human in this city, still, despite Brickell being one of the densest neighborhoods in the USA

Thank you all for your continued expertise and relaying your experience in these forums. I left active duty in 2014, after 20 years of active service, and was also given 80% disability by the VA at discharge (BDD). Part of that rating was MH at 50%. I am curious if I can add GERD and Gallbladder Removal (7318) as secondary to my MH rating? If so, does anyone have any personal experience in this area that would be beneficial to me as I go through this process?

I had my Gallbladder removed 6 years ago (with resulting inconsistent bowel movements, sorry). In addition, I've been on prescription medication such as pantoprazole and omeprazole since before discharge (continuously for over 10 years).  As an example, my stomach ""growls"" and at the most inopportune times. I've got used to telling workgroups, etc. that I simply ""drank too much coffee.""

I wish you all a great 2025! Thank you in advance for the assistance.

Bill

But every once in a while I just have to wait for the shoe to drop for one of my autistic traits to be misinterpreted and for him to get mad at me for it. I’ve shown him tons of educational TikTok videos on Autism, but he still forgets things that I’ve shown him before. 

I literally showed him this TikTok 2 days ago- https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTYW9HWS8/

but today while I was in our kitchen making a smoothie he decided to make a cup of coffee at 9am, when we woke up at 7:30am. I said word for word “I don’t understand why you don’t make your coffee first thing in the morning” and he snapped at me and said “I don’t have to go by your schedule. I can make my coffee whenever I want.” 

I could tell he was mad. I even asked him later if he was mad at me, and he said yes he was mad at me. And that made me mad at him. I had a meltdown and told him fuck you and you’re crazy. I know I shouldn’t have said this but I was just so upset because I know I did nothing wrong. I’m shocked that I can show him that exact TikTok 2 days ago but yet he still gets mad at me for things like this.

I was thinking about my teenagers and how hard they were and also how sleep deprived I was.

Why was I so sleep deprived as a teenager? Some of it obviously due to the normal Shenanigans of a teenager staying up late but the vast majority of it stemming from being forced to wake up every morning at 4:30 to go to early morning Seminary

So just remember kids, anytime a member tries to give you grief for drinking coffee or alcohol and tell you how detrimental it is to your health, gently remind them that 4 years of early morning Seminary is likely done more damage than any amount of coffee ever will😂......😭

I wanted to share my experience and tips about visiting the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, since I've been there multiple times and finally figured out the perfect time to go.

After several visits, I can confidently say that Tuesday and Wednesday mornings are the sweet spot for the best experience. Here's why:

The crowds are significantly smaller during weekdays, especially in the morning. I've noticed that most school field trips happen on Thursdays and Fridays, and weekends are obviously packed with families. When you go on a Tuesday or Wednesday morning, you can actually take your time looking at the exhibits without feeling rushed or having to peek over someone's shoulder.

I've found that the animals are also more active in the morning. The seals and sea lions are especially playful during their morning feeding sessions, and the otters are usually doing their adorable morning routines. It's like they've had their morning coffee too!

Pro tip: Get there right when they open at 9 AM. The first two hours are golden - you'll get amazing photos without random people in the background, and you can actually read all those interesting information panels without holding up a line of people behind you.

I recently discovered this awesome deal where you can get skip-the-line tickets (which are a lifesaver during busy days) and access to all exhibits including the new Frogs exhibit opening in May 2024. You can check it out here: https://athometouch.com/Aquarium

Some extra tips from my experiences:
- Parking is only $8 with validation (way cheaper than most LA attractions)
- The 4D theater shows are less crowded before noon
- The Pacific Visions exhibit usually gets busier in the afternoon
- The cafeteria is less crowded around 11:30 AM (before the lunch rush)

During my last visit on a Tuesday morning, I practically had the shark exhibit to myself for like 15 minutes! Try getting that experience on a Saturday afternoon.

Also, if you're coming from LA, morning traffic heading south to Long Beach is much better than afternoon traffic. Trust me on this one - I've made that mistake before.

The best part about going early is that you'll be done by early afternoon, leaving you plenty of time to explore other parts of Long Beach or grab a late lunch at one of the nearby restaurants at Shoreline Village.

Hope this helps you plan your visit! Let me know if you have any questions - I'm always happy to share more tips about making the most of your aquarium experience.",1,1735666526.0,LosAngelesTrips,0,1.0,False

The next morning, the nightmare was still clinging to me. My hands trembled as I fumbled with the coffee pot in the dorm’s kitchenette, every sound too loud, every shadow too deep. I hadn’t told Sam about the dream. He would have laughed it off, maybe made another crack about my “haunted doll.” But something about it felt too real, like she’d actually been there, standing over me.

When I got back to the room, Sam was staring at the doll, a faint smirk tugging at the corners of his mouth.

“You seriously kept that thing on your desk?” he asked, tossing a crumpled piece of paper at it. It hit her face with a soft thunk and rolled off. “Dude, it’s creepy as hell.”

“She’s fine,” I said, trying to sound casual.

“She?” Sam raised an eyebrow. “Oh, man, you’re getting attached. Should I give you guys some alone time?”

I rolled my eyes and shoved past him, sitting at my desk. The doll’s hollow eyes seemed darker today, deeper, as if they were absorbing the light from the room. I reached out, hesitating for just a second before picking her up. The porcelain was cold—colder than I remembered.

That’s when I saw it.

Beneath the doll’s matted black hair, etched into the back of her neck, was a single word:

“Marid.”


---

The word sent a chill down my spine, but I didn’t know why. It felt familiar, even though I was sure I’d never seen it before. I pulled out my laptop and started searching. Most of the results were useless—random links to gaming forums, some foreign language pages I couldn’t read. But then I found something buried in a PDF of old folklore.

The word Marid was tied to Middle Eastern mythology, specifically stories about djinn. They were described as powerful, vengeful beings, often associated with water or storms. The passage I read claimed Marids were the strongest and most dangerous of their kind—impossible to control, thriving on fear and guilt.

“Thriving on fear,” I muttered to myself, glancing at the doll. Her hollow eyes seemed to follow me, and I quickly looked away.

“What are you mumbling about?” Sam asked, throwing a bag of chips on his bed.

“Nothing,” I said, shutting the laptop. “Just some research.”

Sam laughed. “Research? On the haunted doll? God, you’re gonna turn into one of those ghost-hunting YouTubers.”

I ignored him and shoved the laptop into my bag. I needed to get out of the room. The air felt heavy, oppressive, like the walls were closing in.


---

That night, the smell of mildew was stronger. It clung to everything—my clothes, my bedding, the air itself. I tried to ignore it, burying my face in my pillow, but I couldn’t sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I heard it.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

It was faint at first, like fingers drumming on wood, but it grew louder, sharper. I sat up, my heart racing. The room was dark except for the faint glow of my laptop screen. The doll was still on the desk, but now her head was tilted further, almost at a ninety-degree angle.

“Sam?” I whispered.

He didn’t stir. He was sprawled on his bed, snoring softly.

I swung my legs over the side of the bed, my feet hitting the cold floor. The tapping stopped immediately, replaced by an eerie silence. I stared at the doll, half-expecting her to move, but she didn’t.

“I’m losing it,” I muttered, running a hand through my hair.

I grabbed the doll, intending to shove her into the closet, but the moment I touched her, a wave of nausea washed over me. My vision blurred, and for a split second, I was somewhere else.

The forest from my dream.

The trees were darker now, their twisted branches reaching for me like claws. The altar was there, covered in glowing, jagged symbols. The doll stood on it, her hollow eyes burning with an unnatural light.

“You cannot run,” she whispered, her voice echoing around me.

I dropped her, the porcelain hitting the desk with a dull thud. The room snapped back into focus, the nausea fading, but my hands were still shaking.

Sam stirred, muttering something under his breath. I climbed back into bed, pulling the covers over me, but I couldn’t stop staring at her.


---

The next day, I went to the library. I told myself it was just for a change of scenery, but the truth was, I couldn’t stay in that room anymore. I spent hours scouring old books and online archives, trying to piece together what I could about the word Marid. Most of the information was vague, contradictory—stories of curses, vengeful spirits, and objects imbued with dark power.

One passage stood out:

""The Marid does not seek to harm without purpose, but its vengeance is absolute. Once summoned, it cannot be undone. It feeds on fear, thrives on guilt, and takes what is owed.""

I slammed the book shut, my stomach churning. The doll wasn’t just cursed. It was something worse, something alive. And I had brought it here.


---

When I got back to the dorm, the door was slightly ajar.

“Sam?” I called, stepping inside.

The room was empty. Sam’s bed was unmade, his jacket tossed on the chair, but he wasn’t there. I turned to the desk, and my heart stopped.

The doll wasn’t where I had left her.

She was sitting upright, facing the door.

I hadn’t put her there.

A crumpled piece of parchment lay at her feet. My stomach dropped as I unfolded it, my hands shaking.

The message had changed:

""You spoke her name. Her vengeance begins.""


---

The lights flickered, and the smell of mildew grew overpowering, almost choking me. I stumbled back, dropping the parchment, and the room seemed to shift around me. Shadows writhed in the corners, reaching out like tendrils.

That’s when I heard her.

“You called me,” she whispered.

I spun around, but no one was there. Just the doll, her hollow eyes locked onto mine, her cracked lips curling into the faintest hint of a smile.

And then the lights went out.


---

1hqjhlx,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivore/comments/1hqjhlx/welcome_newbies_lets_get_started_beginner/,Welcome Newbies! Let's Get Started: Beginner Questions and Answers,"# What Should I Read First?

Obviously, this FAQ is a good start.  Other recommended reading is [The Fat of the Land](http://justmeat.co/docs/the-fat-of-the-land-vilhjalmur-stefansson.pdf) (should be required reading), [Bear's Words of Wisdom](http://justmeat.co/docs/the-bear.pdf) (also pretty important), and [Strong Medicine](http://justmeat.co/docs/strong-medicine-blake-donaldson.pdf) (optional but has some good information).  All three of those are available as PDFs from those links.  They are listed in order of how beneficial they are.  I have rarely seen a question that was not addressed in The Fat of the Land.

# I'm sorry but the idea of a zerocarb diet having book requirements sounds like ultimate gatekeeping to me.

This way of eating has a history and that history defines what it is and how it is done.  When someone has questions, they are usually already answered in those sources.  I did not say that any of the books are  required.  I said one 'should' be required, another was pretty  important, and one was optional.  No one is being forced to do anything.   It helps to read the books.  But, we answer the questions of those who don't.

# How Long Should I Try?

You should commit to a full 30 days and 100 individual meals, whichever is greater.  During this time, absolutely no deviation or cheating allowed.  If you cheat, or deviate, restart both counts.

# Should I Slowly Reduce Carbs or Jump Right In?

Some of the other moderators here often will tell people to go do keto, paleo, or some other low-carb plan first.  I don't agree with them.  But, you can go try that.  Your first day of zerocarb will not start until after you completely drop everything though.  I say to just commit and get through it.  Stefansson (The Fat of the Land) says the same thing.

>Beginning the meat diet gradually, trying to make the change less  painful, would be about as considerate as chopping a dog's tail off  gradually, by inches.  \[. . .\] I have seen to it, irrespective of  this token hoarding, that the men changed abruptly from the mixed to  the straight meat diet, the saved-up delicacies being strictly saved,  never used in any tapering off process.

# What Can't I Eat?

You can't eat anything that isn't from the animal kingdom.  That means no plant foods, no artificial sweeteners (nothing sweet actually), no fiber supplements, no alcohol, and no plant oils/fats.  This includes honey.  Some people confuse themselves into thinking honey is an animal product.  It is not.  It isn't even something debatable.  Honey is not allowed in any amounts in the carnivore/zerocarb way of eating.

# OK, What Can I Eat?

You can have any kind of meat.  You do not need to stick with beef.  If you like pork, eat pork.  If you are craving some chicken, eat some chicken.  The same goes for everything else: rabbit, fish, lamb, etc.  You can eat high-fat and low-carb dairy.  That's butter, hard cheeses, and creams.  Dairy can cause issues for people, it should not be considered a main course.  It is more like a seasoning or a side.  Some cheese on a burger is fine.  An 8 ounce block of cheese by itself?  That is not fine.  Eggs are fine also.

# What About Milk?

Don't drink milk. You are a grownup.  As people age, milk become less and less appropriate for humans. Young children can drink milk.

After you had adapted, if you wish to try to include milk, you can give it a shot.  Some people have no problems and find it benefits them.  But, during the getting started phase, no milk.  And, the majority of people never go back to it.

# Do I Need to Eat My Meat Raw?

Nope.  Cook your meat however you like it.

# Do I Need to Eat Organs or Grass-Finished Meat?

Nope.  Eat the meat you enjoy and can afford.  There is no need to ever eat organs or grass-finished meat.  You really do not need to concern yourself with it when just starting.

# What About Seasonings, Salt, and Spices?

Spices are allowed (although make sure sugar is not an ingredient).  Plants are allowed as seasonings and medicines.  A light sprinkling of some spices will not be a problem for most people, although some people do have issues.  Do not get too aggressive with it, light is better.   Meat is delicious, it does not need much to enhance the flavor.  Salt is something you can consume to taste.  There are people who insist you need extra and others who insist that you need none.  Stefansson says none.  The Bear says none.  Most people feel better with salt, even extra salt, at the start.  It is not a deal breaker.

# What About Electrolytes? You don't mention them and lots of people on the sub talk about them.

It is covered under seasonings and  salt. Short answer, historical practice has considered salt to be  problematic and it was not permitted. People adapted fine and we're  successful without using any salt or electrolytes (even during the  adaptation phase).  Stefansson even refused to take it with him on the long journeys and what little they had ran out at the same time they went from a mixed diet to a zerocarb one cold-turkey.

Lots of people  mention it. Sure. Lots of people believe they need to consume a bunch  and worry about balancing electrolytes. They will insist they had  symptoms that only resolved because they increased salt or added  magnesium or whatever. Or they insist they get certain symptoms if they  cut or reduce these things. It will never cease to amaze me, the  powerful effect that beliefs can have on the body.

In the end, salt is probably not super harmful.  If it makes you feel better and sleep well at night, have some extra salt. It is not a deal breaker.

# What About Coffee or Tea?

Coffee and tea are not good for you.  But, coffee is generally well tolerated and accepted by many.  Stefansson allowed it, the Bear allowed it, and many long-term carnivores will still drink it.  It falls into the category of plants as flavoring and/or drugs.  You can keep it for the start.  If you do, it is highly recommended that you try going without it at some point in the future.  Tea tends to be harder on the kidneys and body.  A cup should be fine.  But, but not too much.

If you drink either, some cream is fine.  Real cream and not creamer.  No sweeteners of any kind.  No butter, no coconut oil or MCTs (plant oils are not allowed).  Absolutely no Bullet-Proof coffee monstrosities.

# What About Alcohol?

No.  Definitely not at the start.  And, it is not a great idea after.  If you can't stop drinking for 30+ days while you get through the 30 days / 100 meals, you have bigger problems with alcohol than you do with your food.  Fix that first.

# How Much Should I Eat / When Should I Eat?

More than you expect and more often than you think.  The absolute minimum recommended amount (from Strong Medicine) is 3 meals a day of 6 ounces of lean and 2 ounces of fat.  That is equivalent to 3x8oz of (75%/25% ground beef).   One and a half pounds over three meals is about 1,995 calories and 109 grams of protein.  This is the FIRM minimum allowed (small women might get prescribed and eat this amount).  Eating more at any of the three meals was allowed.  For larger people more was encouraged.  Eating less than this was failure to follow the protocol.

Ideally, you will attempt to follow a similar eating protocol and plan at the start.

We   strongly discourage intermittent fasting during the first days.  We know that many zerocarbers who have done this for a while will eat 1-2   meals a day, but very few of them started there.  The first purpose of   eating this way is to relearn your body's signals and needs.  You  should  eat when you are hungry and as much as you want.  For people who  have a  history of calories restriction, IF, fasting, or other stuff  like that,  you might have messed up your ability to know when you are  hungry.  Try  and eat several times during the day.  Have at least two  bites of the  food.  If you eat a couple of bites and really aren't  interested, put it  away and come back to it later.  You will often be  shocked to learn  that you were hungry.  This has other benefits.   First, it reduces  cravings for the foods you shouldn't eat.  If you are  full, you are less  likely to fall to temptation.  Second, it provides  ample nutrients for  your body to heal and get back on track.  Third,  you are sending signals  to your body that food is ample and there is no  shortage.  There's no  need to preserve excess fat, energy is available  for the taking whenever  desired.  You may not lose super quickly  eating this way, although many  people do still lose a lot, you will get  healthy and reach a healthy  weight this way.  Remember, you can starve  yourself thin; but, you will  never starve yourself healthy.

Our position on IF is perfectly summed up by The Bear.

>It   is perfectly ok to only eat one large meal/day, like a three pound   steak- but it is likewise just as ok to eat as many as six. If you are   working out and trying to gain muscle mass, eat six smaller steaks   rather than one or two big ones. I have eaten as much as four or five    pounds of steak in a day- and as little as one or two, it matters   not--but if you ingest less calories than you are burning, you will lose   muscle mass as well as bodyfat. If you ingest more than you need, the   body discards the excess--quite different than is the case with carbs.

# I Can't  Eat Enough At My OMAD!

OMAD is a totally different way of eating from carnivore. Let go of that idea and eat multiple times.

There are zerocarbers who end up  eating one huge meal a day, but it is not everyone. Lots of people end  up with two or three meals a day. Some feel best with even more. But the  number of meals does not matter. All of them eat when their body  requests food. All of them eat enough to fuel their body well.

If  you read the above, the minimum amount for starting out should be three  meals of 8 ounces or more of fatty meat. After you have a few months  under your belt and have learned to listen to your body when it asks for  more or is not asking for food, then you can try something else.

# How Will I Poop Without Fiber?

You   will poop again.  It might slow down.  It might speed up.  Do not  trust  a fart.  One frequent adaptation issue is very loose movements.   It's  not uncontrollable diarrhea, but it is very watery.  These things   normalize in time.  But, you will almost never fart.  If you think you   have to fart, try going to the bathroom.  You won't regret that   precaution.

# Do I Need to Take Supplements? What About Medications?

You do not need supplements.  You can continue to take medications prescribed to you.  Be aware that your body may become more sensitive to the medication and require less as time goes on.  Work with your doctor.

# Do I Need to Buy Anything?

You do not need anything to eat this way.  Do not go out and buy ketone strips, glucose monitors, coaching or anything else.  There is no need to pay for any books.  We have the main ones available for free.  There are no supplies you need to buy, other than the meat that you can afford and enjoy.  It is not  wrong to buy someone's book, but you are not going to be more successful because you do.

Be wary of people trying to sell you something.  There is no need to pay $120 a month for coaching.  We provide all the information you need here for free.  Actually, all the best, most experienced, and helpful zerocarbers offer their help for free and are out there.  Many of us have been helping others for years, for free.  You don't need to buy your meats from any specific supplier.  There are no supplements or vitamins that we are selling.  In fact, if anyone offers advice that also includes something you should buy, that is a pretty good sign that you shouldn't trust them.

# Who Do I Trust?

You will frequently see people with different opinions arguing on here.  People will tell you that you need to eat liver, fast, stare at the sun, rub your left foot counterclockwise under a full moon, etc.  Often this advice will be contradictory.  When in doubt, compare that advice to The Fat of the Land, The Bear's Words of Wisdom, and maybe Strong Medicine (if you haven't already got an answer by then).  If none of those address it, chances are it is not that important.  Look for people who have been doing this for a while and what they do, although be careful.  Some people lie about how long they have done it.  Use your common sense and be willing to test things yourself.  Just because we eat this way does not mean we reject all science, common sense, and logic.  Staring at the sun and arguing that the Earth is flat does not make you extra-zerocarb, it makes you extra-special (and not in a good way).

# Will I Get Scurvy?

No.  Read The Fat of the Land for more details.

# Will I Die?

Yes.  You are human, and all humans will eventually die.  But, this diet won't kill you.  This is the diet meant to keep you alive and healthy.  It will not make you immortal.  It won't make you immune from all disease or a super-hero.  It will give your body the best fighting shot at health.

# What If I Have a Special Medical Issue or Condition?

First, always work with your medical professional.  They are aware of your specific situation in a way that people on the internet are not.  For people with histamine issues and other issues with severe allergies, it may require cutting all spices out and seeking fresher meat than normal (start with spices).  People without gallbladders might need to eat more often to avoid overloading on fat.   Some people may find that they react to eggs and dairy and they need to reduce even those down to zero.  If possible, try and complete a run before tweaking, but also be aware of your specific circumstances.

Hi everyone, 

I am located in Ontario, Canada. I received a Nespresso Vertuo Pop+ for Christmas with pods and I love it! It’s been the best cup of coffee I’ve had from a machine. 

I recently learned how aluminum may lead to increased chances of Alzheimer’s and knowing that the Nespresso pods are made of aluminum, I am having some doubts. 

I know the pods are coated in a “food safe lacquer”. When I reached out to Nespresso support about this they said the lacquer is a thermoplastic polymer. This means that’s there are microplastics as well as the possibility of aluminum leeching into the coffee. 

I have been searching high and low for alternatives such as compostable pods or reusable stainless steel ones. There are no compostable ones and the stainless steel ones may lead to damaging the machine. 

I would really like to continue using this machine but I want to minimize my exposure to these toxic materials and endocrine disrupters. 

Now, I know some of you will say “we’re always exposed to microplastics and aluminum” which is true, I want to actively try and reduce this exposure by choosing the right products. I get I can’t control certain exposures but I can control this. 

If there are no alternatives, do you know of any other machines? I previously used a Keurig which is mediocre and I know they have plastic and compostable pods.

DG corporate doesn’t give a shit about its employees unless they’re full time or a manager. Sadly I’m not even a key holder, so I’m only getting $10/hr, which in this economy is literally nothing. I feel like I’m working my ass off, but I’m having nothing to show for it. My paychecks are only like $250 a week, making it impossible for me to find an apartment. I will be forced to start working another job at a coffee shop just to bring in more than $400 a week. I will literally have to miss out on my life outside of work and just work my ass off just so I can go home to my new apartment for an hour and go to sleep and repeat the same bullshit the next day",4,1735665198.0,DollarGeneral,2,1.0,False

When it initially happened it hurt quite badly, but I was able to walk so wasn’t worried about it till it swelled up a couple of hours later. Got it checked out at an urgent care and no break, so the doctor didn‘t seem concerned.

However, today it is still quite tender to the touch and uncomfortable feeling. I’ve also noticed the swelling that initially went away seems to have reappeared. Worrisome? Or dumb to get checked out again since it’s just a soft tissue injury? Photos from today.

The Importance of Quality and Flavor in Coffee Reviews
------------------------------------------------------

Coffee lovers know that not all brews are created equal. When talking about coffee reviews, two key elements stand out: quality and flavor. Both of these factors significantly affect the overall coffee experience and, consequently, influence buyer decisions. Let’s delve deeper into why quality and flavor are essential in coffee reviews and how they can guide you in your next coffee purchase.

### The Role of Quality in Coffee Selection

Quality is not just a buzzword; it defines the essence of what makes each cup special. High-quality coffee beans ensure a consistent and satisfying experience. There are several components to consider when assessing the quality:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/product-review-don-francisco's  
  
- **Bean Origin:** The geographic location where the beans are grown plays a crucial role. Regions like Colombia, Ethiopia, and Costa Rica produce distinct flavor profiles that can enhance your coffee experience.
- **Processing Method:** How beans are processed after harvest—from washed to natural methods—impacts their taste, acidity, and overall quality.
- **Freshness:** Coffee is best enjoyed fresh. As it ages, its flavor diminishes. It's important to look for roasters who provide roasting dates on their bags.
- **Roast Level:** Different roast levels—light, medium, or dark—can highlight or mask various flavor notes. Understanding your preference can enhance your coffee enjoyment.

### Flavor: The Heart of the Coffee Experience

Flavor is what truly captivates you in every sip of coffee. It’s the range of distinctive tastes—from fruity to nutty, floral to chocolatey—that sets each cup apart. Here’s why flavor matters:

- **Taste Profiles:** A nuanced flavor profile can indicate the quality of the coffee. Reviewers often describe these profiles to give potential buyers a sense of what to expect.
- **Balance:** The balance between acidity, sweetness, and bitterness in coffee can greatly affect your experience. A well-balanced cup is often more enjoyable.
- **Aftertaste:** The lingering taste after taking a sip can reveal the complexities of the coffee. A pleasant aftertaste is often a sign of high-quality beans.

### Why You Should Trust Coffee Reviews

In the vast sea of coffee options, reviews serve as your valuable guide. A well-done review should highlight both the quality and flavor of the coffee, providing you with insight before making a purchase. Look for reviews that discuss specific flavor notes and quality metrics. These elements help you make informed choices based on your preferences.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/product-review-don-francisco's  
  
When reading reviews, consider the following:

- **Descriptive Language:** Good reviews use descriptive terms that allow you to imagine the flavor profile. Vivid descriptions can give you a clearer picture of what to expect.
- **Personal Experience:** Authentic reviews often share the reviewer’s personal coffee journey, helping you relate and understand their perspective.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Top-notch reviews may compare different brands and brews, giving insights into which options stand out in terms of quality and flavor.

### Making Your Coffee Choices

When buying your next bag of coffee, use the knowledge from reviews to guide you. Look for those that clearly outline the quality and flavor characteristics. Taking the time to understand these nuances will not only enhance your coffee-drinking experience but also help you explore options that align with your palate.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/product-review-don-francisco's  
  
Start exploring various brands and blends. Taste testing is the best way to identify what you like. With the reviews you read, you’ll be better equipped to choose quality coffee that delights your taste buds.

Remember, coffee is not just a drink; it’s an experience. Quality and flavor are the cornerstones of this experience, and with thoughtful reviews, you can make choices that elevate your daily brew. Find what resonates with you, and enjoy the journey in every cup.

When the big epic plot beats start to develop with the High Entia, that's when the game really took off. From the moment I reached the Eryth Sea the game went from ""is ok"" to ""now I'm having a lot of fun.""

Combat: I'm glad the tutorials were there to access unlike 2. Now this one is on me but even by the end of the game I did not fully understand the mechanics of the combat system. Multipliers, how to extend chains consistently, frankly it was a bit overwhelming for me to keep up with everything. And I didn't really like any of the characters that much, but the party I used was good enough to get through the whole game without many hiccups (Shulk, Dunban, Riki) so I didn't stress much or blame the game. I could have taken the time to learn the ins and outs but frankly I vastly prefer the battling in 2 to 1 in every way. But I didn't like the way equipment was handled either (why is Agility the king stat, it seems? I never figured out what weight does. 90% of gems seem useless. Etc. Would love to hear from a hardcore XC fan what I'm missing about all this.)

Music: phenomenal. Again not quite on the level of 2 but I adore the music in this game, this series reminded me that there are still modern games with incredibly beautiful, expressive, CATCHY music.

Visuals: the remastered graphics look good, but the animations still look clunky. It looks like a highly polished PS2 game frankly. I'm not a graphics snob but there were still lots of moments of close ups on super blurry textures.

Voice acting: Am I wrong for thinking the voice acting might be better than 2? At least, it doesn't have the questionable voice direction that is present in a lot of 2's scenes. Much of the game plays out like a teenager who just wrote his first big mech sci-fi fantasy anime with teenage protags (in all the best and worst ways) - but only a couple characters distracted me with over the top voices, like Mumkhar.

Like I said earlier, I didn't like any of the characters much. These games have so much in common with anime I watched in my teens 20 years ago, in good and bad ways, and I felt like the party in this game is way more generic than the characters in 2. I felt like 2 focused on developing the individual characters a lot better. I honestly could not care less about Sharla, Reyn, Melia, or Dunban. Riki is fun. Seven is okay even if she's drowning in tropes herself. Shulk is okay for a protagonist - I just hate his name.

Story: again, super boring until about halfway through, but it quickly turned into ""normal people fighting God and Creator of All Things in outer space with escalating rhetoric"" which I love in any JRPG. That's why I pushed through: if I could get to the halfway point I felt like I would be in for a real treat in the endgame and I was very happy to be correct.

I don't think I will go back to finish what I didn't complete. I beat the game with 60 hours but have 6 times that number on 2 - but I am glad to have finally played and beaten Xenoblade Chronicles 1.

I CANNOT WAIT to play 3 and see how it ties in to these games, and hopefully I will beat it before X drops next year. Thanks for reading if you got this far. I absolutely love these games. Even with my gripes, they're so massive with so much content that I still love them dearly. Maybe one day I will replay 1, with a different party, and a better understanding of combat. I did turn casual mode on Lorithia until the end only because I started seeing monsters get 6+ levels above me and I just wanted to get the damn game finished by the end of the night haha.

Here's what helped me while I was on *standard keto* (I've since gone carnivore): Eating clean fresh low-carb veggies, fresh meats, fish, eggs, mushrooms, nuts and natural hard cheeses in moderation, full-fat yogurt and labneh, butter and ghee, Keto Chow meal shakes (animal-sourced proteins, lots of nutrients, no maltodextrin or preservatives), coffee with a little heavy whipping cream instead of sweeteners, lots of water, increasing intake of electrolytes. Individual clean seasonings and spices instead of blends. Since going on carnivore, I've given up the veggies and nuts.

**What I stayed away from/gave up:** Sugar-free drinks, food or sauces designed to taste sweet. Stevia, even the powdered leaf extract with no additives. Seed/plant oils. Alcoholic drinks. Keto substitutes for the real thing, like tortillas and pancake, muffin or other mixes. Quest or other keto bars. Rebel ice cream. Spice blends (many contain maltodextrin). Chocolate, even 100% cocoa. Deli meats and other processed meats like hot dogs, but I do eat uncured sugar-free nitrate/nitrite-free bacon.""

How Your Beginning Can Shape Your Entire Day
Every morning presents a fresh canvas, a new opportunity to paint our day with colors of our
choosing. The way we begin each day can significantly influence our mood, productivity, and
overall experience. This is not just a feel-good statement; it’s a principle backed by psychology
and numerous studies that highlight the impact of our attitudes and actions on our daily life.
The Morning Ritual: Setting the Stage
The journey to a fulfilling day often starts long before we step outside our front door. It begins the
moment we open our eyes. If we choose to rise with a smile and an optimistic mindset, we are
laying a foundation for success.
1. A Smile to Kickstart Your Day
Many of us may groggily roll out of bed, our face set in a frown from the remnants of sleep.
However, beginning your day with a simple smile can change everything. Smiling not only
expresses happiness; it activates the release of neuropeptides, which help to combat stress. The
physiological response that accompanies a smile can elevate your mood, making you more open
to approaching whatever the day may throw your way.
2. Cultivating Calmness and Presence
As we carry on with our morning, cultivating calmness of mind is essential. Instead of reaching
for your phone immediately, spend a few moments in stillness. Focus on your breath. Engage in
mindfulness or meditation practices for just five minutes. This will create a serene mindset that
can counteract the chaos of a busy day. When our minds are calm and collected, we can face
challenges with clarity and composure.
3. A Heart Full of Gratitude
Integrating gratitude into your morning routine can be one of the most transformative practices
you adopt. When you wake up, take a moment to acknowledge three things you are grateful for.
This not only grounds you but also shifts your perspective from what you lack to recognizing the
abundance around you. Feeling grateful lays a positive emotional foundation that can
dramatically enhance your outlook throughout the day.
The Ripple Eﬀect of Positivity
Starting your day with a positive mindset has a ripple effect that influences your thoughts and
actions for the rest of the day. When you wake up with the intention that today will be wonderful,
your brain enters a proactive mode. You become more observant of opportunities that align with
your aspirations and more resistant to negativity.
Actions Speak Louder Than Words
It’s essential to realize that attitude must be paired with action to create meaningful change. Set
intentions for the day—what do you want to accomplish? Make a brief list of tasks that excite you
and give yourself manageable challenges. Completing even small goals can boost your confidence
and motivation.
Moreover, consider incorporating uplifting rituals into your morning—whether it’s enjoying your
favorite mug of coffee, engaging in physical activity, or listening to inspiring podcasts. These
small acts cultivate an environment of positivity and productivity.
Conclusion: Crafting a Beautiful Day
At the end of the day, we are the architects of our experiences. By beginning each morning with a
smile, a calm mind, and a grateful heart, we create a powerful framework for a successful day. It’s
about making a conscious choice, an intentional decision to embrace positivity from the moment
we open our eyes.
So tomorrow morning, as you rise with the sun, take a deep breath, smile, appreciate the beauty
of a new day ahead, and set out with an unwavering belief that it will indeed be a wonderful day.
The path to happiness and fulfillment is in your hands – and it all starts with how you greet the
dawn.

We are not landlords of rental property - this is our first time renting a single room on a 30-days-at-a-time informal yet written agreement.  

This is a small dwelling with an open Floorplan.  The Renter has her own room and access to the common areas of the house.  We have a 12 year old boy in the home.

Within a week of moving in, the Renter began subtle controlling behaviors- ""You sit here atrhe table but not here.""  ""This is my part of living room, no one else should use this part of the room."" We have a truck and utility trailer for our small business, and there is only one space on the property we can park it.  The Renter claimed this as her parking space amd will not move their car to any of the other (better, closer to the house) available parking spaces. Willfully and intentionally confrontational for no apparent reason. There is ample parking for everyone.  

We have been traveling for the holidays, leaving the Renter with the house alone.  Her texts have been increasingly Unsettling.  We keep our home tidy, and it was clean when we left as it always is.  ""I am making a mess and I expect you to be home soon to clean it up!""  Then the next day a picture of an 'accidental' coffee spill on a sentimental paper drawing We have on the wall in the hallway that the kids made years ago.  Accidentally spilled her coffee on it on the wall.  

These messages have been increasingly Unsettling, although not openly threatening of physical safety. Clearly stating an i tention to be destructive of theproperty.  She has spoken aggressively to our 12 year old many times.  

We notified her through text that she has 30 days to vacate, yet we do not feel safe with her in the home. We intend to ask her to leave upon our return. We will have a numbr of witnesses present in case she becomes violent.  

We realize that by law she has the remainder of her 30 day lease (although she has not paid the rent for Janurary yet.)  We are willing to violate that lease in the name of the safety of our home, child, and pets. 

Assuming we can encourage her to vacate immediately law, what legal consequences might there be for violating her right to her remaining 20ish days?

We are hoping for an amicable parting, yet given her escalating bizarre behavior, feel that we should be prepared for that to be unlikely.  

We will speak to a magistrate once it is possible after the holiday.  The Renter has not openly threatened physical harm, although has texted intentions of being destructive of the property.  

Any advice or other options would be most welcome.  This is out Home and we do not feel safe with this person in it.  ",1,1735663902.0,legaladvice,4,1.0,False

just a week ago I had no idea that you can roast coffee in your house, without $$$$ equipment.

  
Why did I start looking into roasting? ... financials, mostly ...

where I life, roasted coffee in small quantities is not cheap, (but I am ;-) ... and I don't really want to purchase 1kg of roasted coffee, just to go stale on me ... But this is not true for green coffee (which also seems to be about half the price of roasted) ... So my rationale is I can easily purchase 1kg of green beens and roast them once a week for my personal consumption and pocket a lot of $$$ as opposed to purchase 125g or 250g bags.

Also, I have a Covid-breadmachine (aren't the all ;-)) ... and just had to shell out 10 bucks for a heatgun ...

  
So after takeing var. YT deep-dives into how to do it, i broke out the BM and HG today, together with 175g of green (el cheapo) beans.

* did a dry-run with the breadmaker to find a 20min pedal-mix only setting (1st min. is slower - but that just worked fine with the still cold beans)
* preheated the BM container to 200C, dumped the beans and hit them with the HG on high, eyeballing the distance (stayed aprox. at the container's top lip.) Clicked off the stopwatch
* I was surprised to have chaff flying around after 1 or 2 min already ... thought that would come way later ...
* the beans did turn nicely from vomit-green to tan-yellowish to move into honey colored and fairly lightly cinnamon. more chaff, more dangerouse me with heatgun in the right and IR-pistol in my left ...
* After 8 min first cracks (hard to hear for me over the HG) as the load evolved into a nice golden brown.
* Later I modulated the HG between hi and low ... and got a good rolling FC action going
* I then took temp measurements more often  (slightly inconsistent with the IR-gun) ... and tried to recall at which temp to pull/drop the beans ... forgot the celsius temp.
* so playing it by the ~~ear~~ eye I tried to not get into too-dark territory and pulled the beans at \~230°C ... I still need to check up if that was ballpark ok or not ... anyway this was slightly past the 12 min mark, which I recalled as a good goalpost.
* after dumping I did the dance of bouncing the beans between 2 metal salad bowls - that worked also quite nicely, as my bean vol. was rather low. 1-2 min did the trick.

  
Lastly, here a pic of how it did turn out ...

About 6 years ago, I woke up in the middle of the night with so much acid in my stomach that I had to run to the bathroom to throw up. Went to the doctor and he told me to take otc omeprazole for the recommended 2 weeks. I did that and the acid reflux came right back. He then tells me to take it for 1 month and then ween off it the following month. Again the reflux returned. He then just told me to take it every day basically forever. Which is what I’ve been doing. 

Last year I wanted to get off ppi’s so I made an appointment with the gastroenterologist and he wanted to do an upper endoscopy, so they do that, take biopsies of my stomach lining. He calls me the following week letting me know I have gastritis (duh). I go in for a follow up and I ask what the fix is. He asks me “does the omeprazole help?” And I say well yea but I don’t like taking meds, especially long term. He tells me to just keep taking them as there are no bad side effects (which I disagree with). 


ANYWAYS. I’m coming here because I feel doctors don’t actually want to help anymore. And acid reflux is ruining my life. The acid has raised the ph of my saliva and has eroded the enamel of my teeth making my pearly whites easily stained by coffee, and making me prone to cavities. 

I brush twice a day with Sensodyne Pronamel: Intensive Enamel repair w/ whitening. 

I floss every night. I stopped drinking, I stopped smoking weed, I don’t drink soda, I stay away from big triggers like spicy food, garlic, raw onion, fatty foods etc. I’m scared to ween off because when I’ve done so in the past I’ll literally get heartburn during my morning coffee. 


I need my caffeine. I may switch to cold brew or Yerba mate as a less acidic option. 

But are there other foods I should introduce?

I usually have a parfait for breakfast which my stomach has 0 issue with. Nonfat Greek yogurt, granola and blueberries and/or strawberries. I stick to lean meats like chicken and fish, once a week have red meat. But I run out of ideas for sides. I usually go with a veggie and a starch

1hqinv8,https://i.redd.it/mzprron9r7ae1.jpeg,I (M31) was hoping to wear this shirt that just fit me in June for NYE festivities tonight. Looks like I need to quickly and desperately make something else work… ,"I feel the need to explain how this has happened to me, for anyone interested. During my wife’s pregnancy, I (M31) gained 130lbs in 9+ months, all in my belly—now stuck with a 67” gut, looking overdue with quadruplets. Doctors say it’s the most extreme case of Couvade Syndrome, or ‘sympathetic pregnancy,’ they’ve seen, hormones pushing my body into a hyper-sympathetic state.

I never thought I’d be writing this, but after what’s happened to my body over the past 9+ months, I feel like I’m living in a surreal medical case study. My wife and I (both 31) are expecting our first children—twins!—and her pregnancy has been going as smoothly as possible. But for me, things took a very bizarre turn. Early in her pregnancy, I began experiencing symptoms of what’s called Couvade Syndrome, or “sympathetic pregnancy,” where men mimic some of their partner’s pregnancy symptoms. At first, it was funny—me complaining about morning nausea and intense cravings while my wife teased me for being dramatic. But as the weeks went on, the symptoms became extreme.

[HERE](https://imgur.com/a/1XUx2qQ) are some photos and videos of me before versus me now in the last couple months of this transformation. 

Within 9+ months, I’ve gained over 130 pounds, and it’s all gone to my belly.  Doctors have tested me for every possible condition—Cushing’s syndrome, hypothyroidism, ascites, insulin resistance, and a laundry list of rare disorders. They ran metabolic panels, hormone tests, and even MRIs to rule out anything that could explain this transformation. Everything came back normal. After countless appointments with endocrinologists, gastroenterologists, and dietitians, the consensus is unanimous: this is the most extreme case of Couvade Syndrome they’ve ever seen. My body has gone into a hyper-sympathetic state, mimicking my wife’s pregnancy so intensely that I now look more pregnant than she does.

Here’s the wildest part: my belly has grown to an unbelievable 67+ inches in circumference. It’s perfectly round, heavy, and tight—so much so that doctors have compared it to an overdue pregnancy with triplets or even quadruplets. I’ve been experiencing cravings, hormonal changes, and even bizarre moments of arousal that have made this entire experience surreal and difficult to process.

The public’s stares reactions to me have been nothing short of overwhelming. Everywhere I go, people treat me like a walking sideshow attraction. Strangers constantly stop me on the street to ask, “When are you due?” or “Are you having twins—or is it triplets?” Sometimes, people assume I’m joking when I say I’m not pregnant or assure them that my belly is real, even, and not a costume. One particularly embarrassing encounter happened when a man followed me in his car, yelling “Hey, heifer! How’d you get so huge, fatass!” and filming me as I struggled to walk. He kept shouting out the window, “When are the babies due?” and even taunted me to run, laughing as I awkwardly waddled down the street. 

Another time, a homeless man trailed me for blocks, loudly asking, “Are you sick? What happened to you? You can still fix this. You look like you’re about to pop!” His comments drew stares from others, and the whole experience left me humiliated. Once, at a grocery store, I reached for something on a high shelf, and the movement caused my shirt to ride up, exposing my belly. A woman nearby loudly gasped and asked if I was okay, or pregnant, and when I assured her I wasn’t pregnant, she looked me up and down in disbelief before walking away, shaking her head.  Thankfully, some guys are entertained or supportive, and say things like “Damn, bro, that’s the most impressive belly I’ve ever seen. Take care of yourself. That’s crazy.”

Our small town caught wind of what was happening to me and even ran a story in the local paper. They did a photo shoot with me and my wife, documenting what they called “the most extreme case of Couvade Syndrome on record.” The article focused on the medical mystery and included photos of me standing next to my wife, both of us cradling our bellies. At one point, they measured my stomach circumference on camera, which was mortifying. The reporter joked that I looked more overdue than my wife, and the whole experience left me red-faced, especially when people in town started recognizing me from the article and stopping me to ask questions.

Family and friends have been equally baffled. My wife’s parents were initially concerned and suggested I get immediate medical attention, while my own family didn’t believe it at first and thought I was exaggerating. Now, it’s become a mix of humor and genuine concern. Even at work, my coworkers started a playful due date countdown for me, marking it on the office calendar alongside my wife’s.

Despite the jokes, I feel terrible that my transformation has overshadowed my wife’s pregnancy. What should have been a time focused on her and the excitement of our twins has turned into a community spectacle about my bizarre condition. She’s been incredibly supportive and laughs it off, joking that I’m taking some of the heat off her by becoming the bigger attraction. But I can’t help feeling guilty—this was supposed to be her moment, and instead, I’m the one everyone’s talking about.

Meanwhile, I’ve struggled to maintain a sense of normalcy. My shirts don’t fit anymore, riding up over my belly and exposing the lower half every time I move. I’ve tried buying larger sizes, but even those don’t last long before I outgrow them. Just the other day, I bent down to tie my shoe at work, and the strain caused a button to pop off my shirt, shooting across the office like a missile. Everyone heard it, and I had to awkwardly laugh it off while turning red. Another time, I stretched to grab something at a 711, and the seam of my shirt tore open right down the side, leaving me scrambling to cover myself. My pants aren’t any better—they’re so tight under the curve of my gut that I’ve split the seams more times than I care to admit.

At work, I’m required to wear a uniform—a button-up shirt, no less—and squeezing into it has become a nightmare. The buttons pull so tight that I’m sure they’ll pop, and they often do—sometimes in front of coworkers or even clients, which is humiliating. I’ve started bringing safety pins to hold my shirts together in emergencies, but even those can barely contain the strain. Each week, I’m outgrowing something else, to the point where I’m running out of options entirely.

Getting dressed in the morning has become a daily battle. Pulling my pants up under the massive curve of my belly feels like trying to fit into a sausage casing. The waistband digs into me so tightly that it makes my gut stick out even more, exaggerating its size and making me look even more absurdly pregnant. My belt creaks and groans whenever I sit down, and I constantly worry it’s going to snap. Even sitting in a chair has become a spectacle; I have to ease myself down slowly to avoid bursting buttons or causing the furniture to creak under my weight.

Movement is an entirely different challenge. I can barely bend over to tie my shoes without my belly pressing hard against my thighs, forcing me to hold my breath just to reach the laces. I’ve started wearing slip-ons to avoid the embarrassment. Getting in and out of my car is another ordeal—it feels like I’m wedging myself into a tight space, my belly brushing against the steering wheel no matter how far back I push the seat. Walking down the street, my belly bounces and jiggles with every step, drawing stares from passersby. Sometimes, I even catch people filming me.

Everyday tasks that used to be simple now feel monumental, and I’ve stopped pretending I can blend in. Despite my best efforts to maintain normalcy, my transformation has made me impossible to ignore.

Doctors have been fascinated by my condition, describing me as a medical anomaly. They’ve even suggested publishing my case in a medical journal, as they’ve never seen anything like it. While I understand their excitement from a scientific perspective, it’s hard not to feel like a sideshow. I’ve been poked, prodded, and measured so many times that I’ve lost count.

As for other symptoms/side effects, there’s a lot more to this experience than just the abdominal growth. Early on, we thought it was kind of adorable how in sync my wife and I were during her pregnancy. I’d wake up nauseous when she did, I’d have random cravings, and we joked about how empathetic I was being when I’d have morning sickness. But as things progressed, it became clear this wasn’t just harmless sympathy symptoms. My body’s hormonal changes went into overdrive. Alongside the weight gain, I’ve dealt with intense mood swings, exhaustion, and an unsettling sensitivity to smells. Even little things, like the scent of strong coffee, can send me running for fresh air.  The exhaustion hasn’t helped with me also not being very active during this time. 

Unlike my wife, I’m not growing two babies, so everything I eat is turning directly into fat, and unfortunately, it’s all going straight to my belly. The uncontrollable cravings have been a big part of this. I naturally eat more than her as it is, but the hormonal changes I’ve been experiencing—like elevated prolactin and cortisol levels—have completely derailed any sense of self-control. It’s as if my body is craving the transformation itself. There have been times I’ve gone on insane binges, eating until I physically couldn’t anymore… Even when I wanted to stop, it felt impossible, I was still hungry, like my body was demanding more fuel to keep growing.

Doctors think my body is in a kind of “hyper-storage mode,” where every calorie is being stored as fat, specifically in my abdomen, almost as if it’s mimicking a pregnancy. Some specialists believe my fat cells in this area might have become overly sensitive to insulin, leading to the rapid, disproportionate fat accumulation. Others suggest that elevated prolactin levels, typically associated with lactation and maternal behaviors, might be affecting how my body stores fat and retains fluid. Combined with some fluid retention in my belly, it’s created this bizarre, ballooning effect that feels completely out of my control. It’s crazy to outgrow a shirt in a matter of a couple weeks. 

One of the more difficult—and frankly embarrassing—symptoms has been this bizarre hormonal arousal.  Sorry if it is TMI to share all of this, but it’s such a large part of the psychological side effects I’ve been dealing with that it would be hard not to include it. My doctors have explained that the surges of prolactin, cortisol, and other pregnancy-related hormones in my system seem to be “confusing” my body, tricking it into thinking this transformation is something I’m meant to desire or enjoy. It’s almost as though my body is trying to gaslight me into embracing the changes so it can continue expanding. They’ve told me that this is likely part of a feedback loop—my body experiences embarrassment or awkwardness from how big I’ve gotten and the trouble I have maneuvering or drawing attention, and that stress triggers a hormonal response that leads to an unexpected surge of arousal. That sensation then clouds my judgment, making me crave situations where I feel even more self-conscious, which leads to choices—like overeating or not avoiding tight clothes—that exacerbate the growth.

This feedback loop is one of the hardest aspects to navigate. It’s created a cycle where I feel like I’m feeding into my own situation, literally and figuratively. The arousal itself feels like my body’s way of pushing me to keep going, even though I logically don’t want to get bigger or draw more attention. And yet, I’ve found myself leaning into these situations, almost unconsciously seeking out moments that leave me even more embarrassed or humiliated. It’s such a strange and difficult headspace to be in because I know it’s my hormones playing tricks on me, but in the moment, it’s hard to fight against. The doctors are optimistic that these reactions should subside once my wife gives birth and my hormones stabilize, but until then, I’m doing my best to stay mindful and not let this cycle get even more out of control.

At the end of the day, I’m still at a loss. My body feels alien to me, and every day brings new challenges. I’ve started wondering if this condition will reverse after my wife gives birth—or if this is something I’ll be living with for the rest of my life.

And I wasn’t ready to let Zain go. 🥺
 
Pixels shouldn’t have such a deep impact on us, but then… that’s why Romance Club works, isn’t it? Paired with stories and music they become alive, and we get to experience the extraordinarily human highest-of-highs and lowest-of-lows journey that is falling in love over and over again. Rituals emerge… cozying up in blankets and a beverage of choice, chunky over-ear headphones on so anyone silly enough to come close as we open a chapter knows instantly we are NOT to be disturbed. Friendships develop… dreaming up scenarios of the first kiss, love confession, and first time together and then cry-typing when they finally happen—*SDKLGHSDFS GIRL WAKE TF UP!!?!? IT’S EVEN BETTER THAN WE IMAGINED THAT OEN LINE DESTROYED ME!!! UGHHHHh, I LOVE HIMMM!!* 😭 Until we’re in this strange space where this is less of a hobby and more a part of our day-to-day routine.

No LI has burrowed their way into my brain deeply as Zain has. 😮‍💨 There are oh-so-many of them I hold dear, but he towers above in how often I think of him. 

I’ve written thousands of words… I’ve created my own guide to pair with the RC wiki to aid in unlocking his route… I’ve all his scenes along with fanart galore screenshotted and organized in a hidden password-protected folder on my phone. It baffles me. Why? Why *HIM?* Somehow, in some way, he’s the perfect blend of power, passion, competence, intelligence, arrogance, wit, hard-shell and gooey-center to make me YEET all common sense and normality out the door. 😵‍💫
 
And today, December 31st, is his birthday…
 
So instead of a goodbye, let this be a celebration. 🥳
 
🏜️ **THE DESERT ROSE ENDING** 🐫
 
Zain and Yasmin couldn’t be more divided in their personalities (as Zain once wryly noted he fell victim to the same curse as his father, a “strong-willed and cold man” cracked wide open by a “dreamy and cheerful [woman]”), and yet more united by the tragic circumstance of their pasts and its haunting influence on their present. Yasmin’s mother, Nafisa—was a revolutionary who fought to overthrow the corrupt regime in Sefer only to be cut down in her prime and brutally murdered, and so to was Zain’s father—Ayub—decades before. As age-old questions get answers, new intrigues come to the surface, and the big bad manipulates from the shadows, Zain and Yasmin are caught in this seemingly futile effort of resistance. Each side-street streaked with blood and every dusty page hidden in secret locations a reminder of the pain suffered by their loved ones and the weight of their legacy bearing down on them. And, of course, if you so choose—Zain and Yasmin’s worst ending (of which I’m far too baby to discuss at length) follows that martyrdom in a most devastating, glass-filled parallel. 
 
But back to our happily ever after. You know that feeling when you’re in the middle of the club… at peak distance from the speakers, and the bass beat drops? 
 
THEIR CITY. ***THEIR CITY!*** 👏 THEIR 👏 CITY!!! 👏 Zain steps up as the leader of Sefer and Yasmin joins him as the leader by his side. Not only taking up the mantle of his father and her mother but also bringing to life the dreams of countless people (including themselves) beyond wildest imaginations. Theirs to reclaim and revolutionize. 
 
Yasmin stating how proud she is to have Zain by her mother’s statue had me sobbing for real. I’ve talked about it often in previous posts… but the colossal shift from where Zain and Yasmin begin and where the two end on his route will forever knock me off my feet. As Yasmin muses over a few chapters earlier, “the man she had once avoided and despised… the man she had laughed at… the man who had become the most important person in her world.” And Zain in turn has the woman he once understood as a silly idealist with her head in the clouds and her face in a book become his beloved who he reveres as a hero and the only person he can disclose his deepest vulnerabilities to and be his truest self with. Blistering arguments soften to gentle teasing, brutal suspicion to unwavering support… but with the obsession for one another burning beneath as explosive as ever.  
 
“They had been both looking for love […] and they found it where they’d least expected it.”
 
🎨 **THE CITY KID ENDING** 🌠
 
Had to cut the beginning of this scene as I was running out of image space per Reddit’s limits. In short, Zain takes Yasmin and his mother to the Uffizi gallery in Florence, Italy. It’s “always closed on Mondays and impossible to get into” but wbk that’s never an issue for Mr. Al-Abbas. The way this man relentlessly brainstorms how to [give to and surprise those he adores](https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceClub/s/5f1Sp349DO)… brb y’all gonna hurl myself into the ocean and scream ‘til I breach the sound barrier. 
 
So much to be charmed here by but the soothing, light-hearted presence of Firuza and her connecting so well with Yasmin they can torment Zain together is just… so special. They’re a **family**. Zain has two women to break him out of his stubbornness and hyper-discipline (stemming from his insecurities) when it comes to work to focus on the things in life that are the most important. And Yasmin, once cast aside and confined to her father’s riyad like Rapunzel in her tower, left abandoned by her mother’s sacrifice, and buoyed as well as suffocated by the care and conservatism of the maid Zuleika, now has this strong, liberated maternal figure alongside the love of her life as a foundation to start the process of healing herself from those fears of isolation and rejection. Firuza too gains a light in Yasmin after the loss of her husband and Zain’s father. 
 
There’s a bitterness to this sweetness though. Zain is still the leader of Sefer while Yasmin resides in Italy—pursuing graduate education there and keeping Firuza company. Their time as a couple limited to those weekends he can escape from his responsibilities and until the city is stable enough for someone new to assume his role. Their love is tested by distance. 
 
Yet, they persist and thrive. One of the first threads that connected Zain and Yasmin (enabling them to look past their distaste for and annoyance at each other) was a shared interest in high art, music, and literature. Zain’s route is layered with references to artists like Aivazovsky and Turner, musicians like Camille Saint-Saëns, and writings like *The Hunchback of Notre Dame* and *The Prince*. This happily ever after uses this link as its centerpiece. 
 
For Zain, Yasmin is the greatest work of all. And for them both, their love resounds as one so consuming and powerful it impacts celestial bodies and the expanse of the universe—as that described in Dante Alighieri’s *Divine Comedy*.
 
👑 **PEEP THAT FASHION** 👗
 
Follow me to slide 18. Cannot overstate how OBSESSED I am with both finale dresses—aptly labeled “The Peacock and the Savage” and “The Sun and Stars.” TDR’s wardrobe has dozens of dazzling outfits, but these are next level. I incorporated Vogue in the post title for a reason! 😋
 
The deep green hue of the DR piece (green being a major thematic color for Zain and Yasmin) contrasted against bright gold… the eye of peacock detailing on the corset and the feather embroidery along the sash and below the waistline. The bold blue purple of the CK piece… reminiscent of a starry sky and joined by a fur stole with an almost planetary puff of volume.
 
The latter was created by artist Ika in February as a fan work of Yasmin in an infamous dress from the animated movie Anastasia. Per TG, Amy saw the work, asked for it to be added to TDR, and fulfilled requests it be placed on Zain’s route. For a happy coincidence, it fits into the story as if diligently planned—only fueling my fascination further.
 
🌹 **WARDA, THE “ROSE”** ✨
 
Inevitable Zain and Yasmin’s daughter would be a cheeky little demon. She’s an impeccable fusion of their features and their spirit. Moody little schemer with big eyes and sly smile and a hand on her cocked hip…along with her father wrapped around her finger. What has such a profound and transformative love story unleashed into the world? 😅
 
Had to highlight at the very end that Warda’s appearance (along with all the endgame children) changes based on the MC sprite. It’s a welcome detail and I cherish how each captures her fierceness. I also appreciate how it all comes full circle in her given name. TDR unfolds with the search for the legendary rose, concludes with its discovery, and endures in a “rose” reborn.

Cheers to Zain on his birthday and to you on this New Year’s Eve/Day for taking the time to read through. 

I’ll miss analyzing him and his dynamic with Yasmin. But who knows, maybe I still have an essay or two (perhaps even a fanfic) about them left in me. 😉",89,1735663455.0,RomanceClub,1,0.95,False

Here are all the soft, sweet, delicious details","Text in the event of paywall…


By Lauren Ferranti-Ballem Special to the Star
When people tell me they don’t care for panettone, it’s usually because they paid a pretty price for a dusty imported loaf pocked with unidentified fruity rubble plucked from the walls of panettone that line grocery stores every year at the holidays. 

What a city we live in, then, that there are so many bakeries are making fresh, artisanal panettone with Canadian egg yolks and house-candied citrus. The process doesn’t vary much because panettone demands rigour: three days, three mixes, fastidious temperature control and, once baked, it needs to be very quickly flipped and hung upside down to maintain that sugar-crusted duomo. “Besides kids, panettone is the most finicky thing I make,” says An Tran, owner-baker of Ba Noi on Bloor West. The biggest difference among the locals’ loaves is their sourdough starter — the madre — and the inclusions they choose. It’s a formidable task with a steep learning curve — it shatters patience, budgets and sometimes hearts. “I joke that the best thing about panettone is the first and last day of the season. In between, it’s a gamble,” says Daniel Saez, from the Junction’s Noctua Bakery. Luca Rotatori, head baker at Terroni, Sud Forno and Spaccio, has been making panettone for 12 years and is at once enchanted and bewildered by the work. “If something goes wrong or right, it’s hard to know what it is,” he says with a shrug.

So why do they do it? Because when it’s right, panettone is light and fluffy, melt-in-your-mouth rich, gorgeous, balanced and made for any moment — snowy mornings with coffee, after supper with amaro, gifting, parties or a quick snack, like the most elegant holiday power bar. We tasted six excellent local loaves to help you choose.

Unwrap Tito’s candied grapefruit panettone and buttery sweetness surrounds you. This vanilla bean-flecked loaf has a soft peachy hue and pleasant cakey density. Even with its house-candied grapefruit jewels, this might be the most kid-friendly panettone of the bunch. Novell Fallar and Cindy Feng, the couple behind Tito, also make an ube (purple sweet potato) and white chocolate loaf, that’s a striking violet inside.

Every baker on this list seems to embrace the practical and emotional challenges of panettone making, An Tran included. “A key part of the process is a lot of crying,” he jokes. Ba Noi’s tall, pearl sugar-topped classic loaves have plenty of plump raisins and cranberries, which he soaks in orange liqueur and spiced rum. These flavours perfume the feathery panettone, while the pops of red cranberry are especially festive. Tran’s favourite way to eat a slice: heat salted butter in a warm skillet and toast. 

The stunner: Toronto Panettone Company Triple Chocolate Panettone

The triple chocolate panettone from TPC is a stunning specimen. It has an unbelievably symmetrical, lofty dome, holey and golden brioche interior and pockets of velvety chocolate. Baker-owner Mike Taylor is also especially proud of his glaze, a mix of egg whites, cocoa, sugar and almond flour. “It brings the non-believers in. It’s essentially an amaretto biscuit on top, with pearl sugar for crunch.” 

Most fruit-full: Noctua Classico Panettone

Noctua’s panettone is a collaboration between baker-owner Daniel Saez and fellow panettone-obsessive chef Carlo Lazzarino. For the short, stout classico, they candy their own orange peel (saved from brunch service by their friends at the Ace on Roncesvalles) and bathe raisins in brown butter. Noctua is also making chocolate panettone and, special this year, one with Turkish apricots macerated in Niagara wine with white chocolate and tonka bean (a vanilla bean-adjacent baking spice common in Venezuela, where Daniel is from).

This French patisserie’s panettone is a technical wonder, packed with three chocolates, each with a job to do. Dark chocolate balances the sweet with bitterness and complexity; milk chocolate adds roundness and caramelization; white chocolate, a silent partner, mostly disappears during baking, adding fat and extra air pockets to the dough. It comes in a glossy white box ready for giving (even to yourself). Pastry chef-owner Rodney Alléguède recommends serving it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Party ready: Terroni/Spaccio Panettone al Negroni

Fun to say and even more fun to eat, Negroni panettone is just that: a loaf made with Terroni’s distinctive mother yeast, now more than 20 years old, infused with Negroni syrup. One loaf contains the equivalent of two cocktails, so serve responsibly. Slice it open at the end of a meal and behold pretty pink swirls in its downy interior and hunks of sweet, juicy candied orange from Italy.

Your first battlefield is the online marketplace. I'm talking Zillow, Redfin, Facebook Marketplace, and Craigslist. Here's the raw truth – we used to show step-by-step videos of our lead generation process, but YouTube shut that down because of privacy concerns. But here's what I'll tell you: all that premium content? It's waiting for you in our private SKOOL community vault. Free to join, but only for those serious about winning.

On Facebook Marketplace, cut through the noise. Agents and wholesalers flood the platform, but here's your advantage: one simple question – ""Are you the owner or an agent?"" That's your filter. That's your time-saver. 

Don't sleep on Craigslist. The boomer generation, this silver tsunami of sellers? They're creatures of habit. While everyone's chasing the next shiny platform, they're still posting their properties where they always have. Their resistance to change is your opportunity.

Strategy #2: Boots on the Ground
Winners don't make excuses; they make adjustments. Driving for dollars isn't about dedicating your whole day. It's about strategic route planning during your regular activities. Get out of that car. Knock on doors. Talk to neighbors. Leave your mark. Every interaction is an opportunity, and every opportunity missed is money left on the table.

Strategy #3: Social Media Dominance
Here's the reality check – posting once won't cut it. The human brain needs seven exposures to your message before it sticks. You need to be everywhere, consistently. Broadcast that you're hunting for ugly houses. But here's where most fail – they don't incentivize referrals.

I'll give you a winner's secret: Someone sends you a referral? Hit them with a $5 Starbucks e-gift card. Immediately. Even if the deal goes nowhere. Why? Because winners understand the long game. You're not buying coffee; you're buying mindshare. You're building an army of people thinking about you every time they see an ugly house.

Want more strategies like this? Join our SKOOL community. But only if you're ready to work. Only if you're ready to win. Because this isn't about trying – it's about doing. And the only difference between where you are and where you want to be is your willingness to execute.

Ready to dominate? Hit that subscribe button. Smash that like. And remember – the only bad lead is the one you never got because you were too afraid to ask.",1,1735663231.0,dispodragons,0,1.0,False

The scene seems almost peaceful until you remember the usual tech hurdles—coding, jargon, endless tutorials. But what if it didn't have to be that way?

Enter no-code platforms like Bolt and Cursor, offering a new path for creators. These tools strip away the intimidation traditionally tied to app development. Now, visual creation is at your fingertips. Imagine dragging and dropping components, watching your vision unfold without any coding knowledge.

This isn't just about making life easier; it’s about leveling the playing field. Whether you're running a small business, building a community platform, or aspiring to launch the next tech sensation, these platforms make innovation accessible. They provide a canvas for your creativity, where the only limit is your imagination, not your technical skills.

As you explore these no-code possibilities, you'll discover a vibrant avenue for engaging with users and maybe even reshaping how we think about technology. This isn't just a fleeting trend—it's part of a larger movement toward empowerment and inclusivity.

Like I don't even have one person who messages me or God forbid, call me if they didn't see me for a while. I always get the good old ""Long time no see, I have been meaning to ask whats going on with you"" treatment when I meet them for some reason in person, but I know they dont mean it because they never do no matter how long we dont see eachother. I don't know why either. Only time I get messages once in a while is if they want something from me, like my help. No merry christmas, happy new year, no ""are you dead yet""? Nothing.

Other people I don't hear from at all. I know this person that shares even some personal stuff with me that he doesn't with others, yet I never got an invitation to a get together or even just a how are you doing on viber or anything really.

What really got to me was I went over to a friend  after christmas to help him fix some problem he had with a window. He made me a coffee. Meanwhile a few common ""friends"" of ours and some others arrived to party, with some wine and drinks. At first I thought this is embarassing, because I thought they forgot to tell me that I should buy drinks when I come over. After I was done with my coffee I started to feel unwelcome, like no one told me to go, but I felt that I should. They didn't ask me to stay or even just have a drink with them. This was pretty humiliating and hurtful. Obviously these people really owe me nothing, but I felt really sad that these are the kinds of people that I looked upon as friends. Was always helpful, supportive and generally a good person towards them, to the point where I thought I earned their friendship.

I have a hard time trusting people as it is, but people i liked disappointing me like this makes it way more crushing. How can I avoid giving such people my friendship and trust? How do I make true friends and form real connections?",2,1735662979.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

Welcome to 2025, where Bitcoin ATMs are as common as coffee shops and just as essential for your daily grind! Gone are the days of fiddling with complex crypto exchanges or wondering if blockchain technology will ever become mainstream. Bitcoin ATMs have swooped in as the heroes of the digital economy—and they’re only getting better.

And guess who’s here to make your Bitcoin ATM experience smoother, faster, and downright magical? Yep, it’s our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker App**, the ultimate sidekick for crypto enthusiasts in this futuristic, blockchain-powered world.

👉 **Step into the future of crypto today:** [https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com)

# The Evolution of Bitcoin ATMs: From Novelty to Necessity

Let’s rewind to 2013, when the first Bitcoin ATM appeared. Back then, it was a curiosity—a shiny beacon for die-hard crypto fans. Fast-forward to 2025, and Bitcoin ATMs are a staple in urban centers, suburban malls, and even rural gas stations.

# What Makes Bitcoin ATMs So Popular Now?

1. **Ubiquity**: With over 50,000 machines worldwide, you’re never more than a few blocks away from your next crypto fix.
2. **Ease of Use**: Intuitive interfaces make these machines accessible to everyone—from tech-savvy Gen Zers to Baby Boomers exploring digital assets.
3. **Versatility**: Modern Bitcoin ATMs support a variety of cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Litecoin, and even Dogecoin.
4. **Instant Transactions**: Forget the agonizing wait for exchange transfers. Bitcoin ATMs get the job done in minutes.

# What’s New with Bitcoin ATMs in 2025?

The Bitcoin ATMs of today are light-years ahead of their predecessors. Think of them as the Tesla of financial kiosks—sleek, efficient, and packed with cutting-edge features.

# 1. Multi-Crypto Support

Why settle for Bitcoin alone? Bitcoin ATMs now allow you to buy, sell, and trade a variety of cryptocurrencies. Got some Monero to cash out? Need to load up on Cardano for that next-gen blockchain project? These machines have you covered.

# 2. Biometric Security

Say goodbye to PIN codes and passwords. With facial recognition and fingerprint scanning, Bitcoin ATMs in 2025 offer unparalleled security and convenience.

# 3. Lower Fees

Thanks to increased competition and streamlined technology, transaction fees have plummeted, making Bitcoin ATMs more affordable than ever.

# 4. Integration with Wallet QR Codes

Here’s where the magic happens. Bitcoin ATMs now rely heavily on QR codes for seamless wallet integration. Instead of typing out wallet addresses (and risking costly errors), users simply scan a QR code and let the ATM do the rest.

And that’s where **our Bitcoin QR Code Maker App** shines like a crypto star!

# QR Codes: The Unsung Heroes of the Bitcoin ATM Revolution

If Bitcoin ATMs are the superheroes of the crypto world, QR codes are their trusty utility belts. These nifty little squares make crypto transactions faster, safer, and completely error-free.

# Why Are QR Codes So Essential?

1. **Accuracy**: Manually entering a wallet address is like trying to defuse a bomb—one wrong move, and it’s game over. QR codes eliminate that risk.
2. **Speed**: Just point, scan, and you’re done.
3. **Versatility**: QR codes can store wallet addresses for multiple cryptocurrencies, making them ideal for Bitcoin ATMs.
4. **Convenience**: No more scribbling wallet addresses on sticky notes or frantically copying and pasting.

# The Role of Our Bitcoin QR Code Maker App in 2025

Now, let’s talk about the real MVP of this story: **our Bitcoin QR Code Maker App**. In a world where Bitcoin ATMs dominate the financial landscape, having a reliable, user-friendly QR code generator is non-negotiable.

# Why Our App Stands Out

* **Multi-Crypto Support**: Generate QR codes for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and more.
* **Customizable Design**: Add logos, adjust colors, and make your QR code uniquely yours.
* **Enhanced Security**: Your wallet address stays safe, thanks to advanced encryption.
* **Effortless Integration**: Whether you’re using a Bitcoin ATM or a mobile wallet, our app ensures your QR codes work flawlessly.

# How to Use a Bitcoin ATM in 2025

New to Bitcoin ATMs? Don’t worry—it’s as easy as 1-2-3 (with a little help from our app).

1. **Find Your Nearest Bitcoin ATM** With so many machines out there, locating one is a breeze. Use a map app or a dedicated crypto ATM locator.
2. **Open Your Wallet** Launch your crypto wallet app and generate a QR code for your wallet address using our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker App**.
3. **Scan and Go** At the ATM, select your transaction type (buy, sell, or trade), scan your QR code, and follow the on-screen prompts.
4. **Complete the Transaction** Insert cash or confirm the crypto transfer, and you’re done. Congrats—you’ve just embraced the future of finance!

# The Future Is Bright with Bitcoin ATMs and QR Codes

In 2025, Bitcoin ATMs and QR codes are revolutionizing how we interact with cryptocurrency. They’ve transformed crypto from a niche interest into a practical, everyday tool for millions of people.

And with **our Bitcoin QR Code Maker App** in your corner, you’re not just keeping up with the times—you’re leading the charge into a smarter, more efficient crypto future.

So, what are you waiting for? Whether you’re buying your first Bitcoin or cashing out your latest gains, our app and Bitcoin ATMs are here to make the process fun, fast, and foolproof.

I met her in a party and immediately noticed interest from her, so I went ahead, got her number and soon after we decided to go to a bar.

The first date was amazing, genuinely the 1st time I've had more fun then anxiety in a date.

from my perspective it all felt magical, the entire last months I've had no interest in any of the girls I've dated and finally I found someone who's smart, pretty and feels the same way about me.

Later that week we met again and I didn't feel so well, I was partially sick, tired after work and nervous about kissing her... I felt pressure to do something because I felt it was odd I didn't kiss her in the 1st date. I felt like this date was worse then the 1st by a mile, but I was told by my friend I'm totally fine, and she's into me and all.

Last week we went to drink coffee, I felt by the end of the date that she kinda lost interest, a day later she told me she wasn't able to take things to the next level. in response I told her that if it has anything to do with the fact I was too passive then I should let her know the reasonings behind it... I explained that I was anxious, wasn't feeling well and out of respect and fear didn't make a move on her.

She told me in response that it wasn't necessarily my fault, and she's sad about it... we wished each other best of luck and headed to our own roads...

Generally I'm a very anxious person, and have a lot of self esteem issues from my past, I used to be fat and had acne and never went to therapy so I'm pretty much deep inside still the same fat dude who just wants to be loved and feels as if I don't deserve it...

She was there for me in the past few weeks after a friend of mine pretty much sexually harassed me, she even mentioned a week before cutting me off that it's odd we talk so much, but it feels right to her...

I'm honestly bummed... it's been a week but I still think about her daily, still having anxiety and thinking how hard I fucked up such a good thing I had...

I think part of me knows it could've worked if I handled things better but I didn't, it crushes me to think that way...

I know it's early but I really wanna text her in about 2 weeks, see whats'up, tell her she's still on my mind and just be completely transparent, about the lack of dating experience I have and why I was so nervous...

Okay so for context, my (29 f) boyfriend (31 m) continues to purposefully wake me up in the mornings my being overly obnoxious. And no, I don’t think I’m being unreasonable or a grouch because the way he loves to wake me up is by singing made up songs loudly, sticking his butt in my face, yelling “WAKE UUUUUUUP”, etc. mind you this is all before 8 am too. 

I have talked to him so many times about how it actually really frustrates me and starts my day off in a bad mood because of being annoyed, and that it’s not just the taunting that frustrates me it’s the fact I’ve communicated that if he wants to wake me up he can do it by being sweet and gentle and that I would be way more receptive to that, but he continues to do it the other way making me feel like he doesn’t respect me or what I ask for.

Well I just got back last night from being out of town for a week for the holidays after a 8 hour drive back home. 1) I thought he would be super excited to see me and get up and hug me when I entered the door but he said he had to finish his dinner first and 2) HE WOKE ME UP AGAIN THIS MORNING BEFORE 8 AM BY BEING SILLY AND SINGING LOUDLY 😩

So I woke up grumpy because I had the expectation that after a week of space and not seeing each other that maybe just MAY E he would be sweet and affectionate and if he wanted to wake me he would do so in a nice way - wasn’t the case. I asked him to stop, he wouldn’t stop. I asked him again and he still didn’t stop and I just said “this is why I have some resentment dude”.

I get it that can sound mean, but I just feel like boundaries aren’t being respected and ultimately it makes me feel like he just doesn’t care about what I ask for and does what he wants because he thinks it’s funny?

When I went to the living room to talk to him I told him it does upset me and tried to have better communication and he just said “can we wait to do this until we have coffee” which made me feel like I just got totally written off. 

Idk I just need to know how to deal with this and if I’m over reacting or not. I would live some insight on how to possibly better communicate my needs. Also would love to know if yall think I’m crazy or not for being upset about this? 😂 TIA!",10,1735662661.0,dating_advice,51,0.69,False

Hello everyone, the year is almost over and with the new one coming in it's the perfect time for a new line up of drinks. We've had this one on the back burner for a while now, didn't wanna give it some cheap distilled water now.

[Oaken Barrel](https://preview.redd.it/34q6nwqqh7ae1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=010e34a4ba96278b31327cc6177200abe2c80410)

We have our first up, a traditional whiskey aged in a charred oak barrel with flavor notes of caramel, vanilla, spice, and a smokey tang, it's good for those days of sitting back and sippin' away.

[Maple Barrel](https://preview.redd.it/z69e9dzoi7ae1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3c68818f60d6514a1283b74bc5027b5c10d0a408)

[Apple](https://preview.redd.it/g7ycqhg3k7ae1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af6dc3942e88e1950207260a5fddd7a0d291be20)

1hqi6ei,https://www.reddit.com/r/TragicallyHip/comments/1hqi6ei/underratedoverrated_tunes/,underrated/overrated tunes?,"I'm currently listening to the Hip (as i do 24/7 of course), and it made me eager for some discourse on their tracks. I was thinking - obviously almost every Hip song is amazing in its own way, but do you guys have any songs that you feel are underrated and overrated? Ones that you feel are appreciated less than they should be, or in comparison, ones that get a little too much love? Here are my thoughts and reasoning:

Underrated:
- Coffee Girl: I know a lot of people have an unfavorable view of We Are The Same because of Bob Rock's involvement, but listening to this album again was a great experience and this song is one of my favorites. I love when the Hip leans more chill and relaxed, and Coffee Girl is a perfect example of this. It's great for easy listening.
- The Rules: Much like my previous pick, this tune is so relaxing and I usually listen to it before I sleep. The drums are simple yet perfect, the guitar is super memorable, and some of Gord's best vocals are on display. It's easily top 3 on Phantom Power for me.
- All Canadian Surf Club: Don't think I need to do much explaining here with this one's crunching guitar and hard-hitting drums. What a banger.

Overrated (a quick note that this doesn't mean I dislike these songs, just prefer others):
- Wheat Kings: Definitely an incredible song, there's no doubt about that. It has great lyrics and is super iconic, but I could never wrap my head around how it's the most streamed on Spotify. I feel like there's a lot of songs with better stories and musicality, and I have to admit that sometimes I skip it.
- Courage: Another fantastic tune, but it's just one that gets old after a while for me. I can't listen to it too frequently or I start to dislike it 😅
- Little Bones: Controversially, I'm not really a big fan of Gord's vocals on this track. From a musical standpoint it's good, but I don't really get the massive hype around it.

1hqi2i8,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hqi2i8/how_do_you_navigate_being_with_a_partner_who/,How do you navigate being with a partner who constantly wants to be out socializing?,"Alittle background that might be pertinent: I (F33) have chosen not to drink alcohol for 2.5 years now. I don’t mind going to bars for special events or to hang out once in a while if that’s what the people I’m hanging with want to do and can happily just drink water/juice. However, I’m currently heavily pregnant (5 weeks away from my due date) and dealing with job stress.  They took away our WFH days (2 a week) and restricted our PTO (they haven’t wanted us to take any since the beginning of Dec) and due to a system conversion, we have had zero to do in the office for the last two weeks so I have had to sit idle “pretending” I have work to do for 40 hours a week. It’s been taxing.

 

Now onto the question. My SO (M31) is incredibly social. He likes to have friends over multiple times during the week after work or on the weekends. No issues there, we have a heated/cooled garage and they generally hang out there so it’s not a bother to me at all. I see my best friend 1-3 times a month over my lunch break for coffee. Occasionally will do something artsy on the weekend a few times a year. Otherwise, I’m doing the things my SO wants to do with his friends. Sometimes this feels like an obligation b/c it’s someone’s bday or celebration and it would be rude for me to not attend, but over the years I have insisted I drive separate so I can leave when I’m tired/done being social. My SO does not do anything with my friends and I, those events I do all on my own.

 

Anyway, he just left the day after Christmas to go on a 17 hour (one way) road trip for his hobby and got back this morning. Total driving time was 34 hours within a 5 day period. He and his friends were up to the early hours of the morning most of the trip, so I’m seriously unsure how he’s even functioning with such a screwed up sleep schedule. I also went to visit family over the weekend and was crammed in a car with four family members for 12 hours. Again, I’m probably just extra tired b/c I’ve been growing a human inside me for the last 8 months, but with the work stress my mental health has been on the fragile side. He had mentioned a couple weeks before his trip that he thought we should go to a town his friend lives in about 45 mins away to celebrate NYE. I figured with this big road trip he took, he’d change his mind when he got back and call it off. I was also under the assumption that if we *did* go to this small town to visit his friend, we’d stay till midnight and come back home.

 

So, he gets home this morning at 7:30AM right before I leave for work and gets into bed to sleep for the day but says, “So we’re still going to <small town> tonight, right?” And I told him I wasn’t sure if I was up for it but maybe I could muster the energy since we’d back home that night and he then proceeded to say that we’d be spending the night at this friend’s house if we went. I maintained my composure but I’m so disappointed. And actually really annoyed. I haven’t seen him for 5 days and I’d like to spend the night together since I actually have the day off tomorrow for the holiday and we could sleep in and cuddle (this is something that really helps my mental health and makes me feel better) and he’s wanting to continue this party time he’s been having since last Thurs. I didn’t say much other than “You actually feel like going out after that long trip?” and he just said, “Yeah, but we can figure it out when you get off work.” And I didn’t want to get crabby so I just thought it best to leave for work and try to figure out how I want to approach this when I get home.

 

I’m so mentally drained that I feel like I should just tell him he can go without me and I’ll just see him whenever he gets home. I truly wouldn’t mind going out for an hour or two tonight after work to “celebrate” NYE, even if it was with some of his friends in town. And I really don’t want to be a debbie downer but it’s hard to pretend I’m ok with his constant need to be socializing when I’m already dealing with stress and fatigue and could really use some emotional support from the person I’ve spent the last 4.5 years with. He’s had almost 2 full weeks off of work (he doesn’t go back till next Monday) and I’ve been stuck at my job hating the 8 hours a day I have to be there.

 

I do have social time with my friends but my need for it is far less than his. He is constantly messaging his friends on his phone all day long or on his xbox headset every night talking with them and then also seeing them during the week/weekends. **How do you politely tell your partner that you’d really like their attention and consideration sometimes even when their friends are partying/doing things without making it seem like you’re trying to control what they do?** Like I said, generally I don’t care if he has people over or goes and does things but after him being gone and me needing a little extra support, it would’ve been nice to have him say he’d be ok spending the night in with me or doing something I’d like.

 

**Tl;dr Partner constantly wants to socialize and I’m trying to figure out how to tell him it’s too much without sounding like I’m trying to control what he does**",0,1735662026.0,relationships,6,0.43,False
1hqi0tb,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_qwaqwa23/comments/1hqi0tb/too_big_for_the_universe/,Too big for the Universe,"It started on an ordinary Tuesday. I was vacationing, sitting at my kitchen table, reading a book, sipping espresso and staring out at the sun-baked streets of a little town in Italy. Life was the same as it had always been: quiet, simple, peaceful. I had no reason to suspect that today, of all days, would be the beginning of something so... unbelievable.

At first, it was a sensation I couldn't quite explain - a faint twinge in my chest, a pressure I couldn't shake. I brushed it off, blaming it on the rich coffee or the long nights I'd been pulling at work. But then, by midday, I noticed something odd in the mirror. My reflection seemed slightly off. Not much, just a tiny shift in how I filled the frame, like I’d gained a few pounds, but I knew I hadn’t.

I shrugged, thinking it was just the way the light hit my face, but then, as time went on, I felt it again. The pressure, the stretching. I could almost hear my body creaking, as if my tanned skin was reluctant to accommodate the changes. My hands, normally small and delicate, began to look large, too large for the book I was holding. My clothes, those beloved jeans I’d worn for years, grew uncomfortably tight, and my feet seemed to be pressing harder into the floor.

Panic crept in when my bedroom doorframe didn’t quite fit me anymore. It was just a little too narrow, just a little too small. But then I realized—it wasn’t the door. It was me.

I stumbled to the mirror again, and my heart stopped. My body stretching outward in pulses, inch by inch, as if I was swelling in all directions. My dark hair, normally smooth and falling just below my shoulders, felt different, too. It cascaded out longer, thicker, as if even the smallest part of me refused to be ordinary anymore.

I ran outside into the streets, hoping the open air would help me make sense of it. But the world around me seemed to shrink. Buildings that had once towered over me now seemed small, like toys beneath my ever-expanding form. The cobblestones cracked underfoot as I grew. My legs felt strange and long, too long for the ground beneath them, pushed against the earth, each step now an effort that caused the land to tremble.

People screamed. They ran, scattered like ants before an unstoppable force. I didn’t mean to terrify them. I didn’t know what was happening to me. But I couldn’t stop it. Every breath I took, every movement, only seemed to make me grow faster. I felt my my bones reforming, shifting in ways that were impossible to understand.

It was overwhelming. I was changing in a way that defied nature. My body felt great pleasure with each spurt. My mind raced to comprehend what was happening to me. Was I becoming a giantess? A goddess? Was this just some weird dream that would end once I woke up? Did I actually want to wake up? The feeling of sheer power and strength was too arousing to dismiss.

By evening, I couldn’t see the sky anymore. I had passed the limits of my town, of my country, of everything I had ever known. I became too large to feel the wind, too vast to hear the voices of the people who once knew me. The world below was just a pale reflection of a life that seemed so small and far away now. I could see, reach - and destroy - every corner of the earth, every ocean, every mountain.

I had grown beyond the limits of this world. I grew past the moon, past the sun, past everything that made sense, planets no larger than marbles. Soon, the very stars themselves seemed to dwindle beneath me.

Galaxies seemed so small. I stretched, my limbs reaching out, my consciousness expanding, as though I were becoming one with the universe, but still not quite fitting within it. I knew, deep down, that I would continue growing until I was too big for anything in existence.

My heart, once small and contained, now felt like it was spread out across light-years. I was everything and nothing. Infinite and confined. Alone, but containing all that was.

And I knew, with a clarity that frightened me, that I would never, for the whole of eternity, stop growing.",1,1735661899.0,u_qwaqwa23,0,1.0,False

The Overseer planned for Bruce and Tom to leave the cabin by November, but it begins to rain while they’re loading the last of the crates on the truck.

“Christ. Fifteen percent chance, my ass!” Tom’s eyebrows mash together. “Isn’t this just our luck? I’ll be damned! The road will be covered in sleet soon, don’t you think?”

Bruce grunts, the pits of his flannel and cotton undershirt dark with sweat.

“Well... I’ll call the Overseer, and let him know, there’s no way we’ll make it back in time. We can’t drive in these conditions.”

“At least it’s not a tornado.”

“I’m still not transporting the meat in this weather.” 

Tom’s brows merge again. “Guess we have to take all these crates back inside.”

The company mascot is stamped on every crate: the head of a white rabbit with yellow eyes and teeth. Tom and Bruce wear the mascot on their boots. A hundred or so rabbits stare at them from the truck.

Bruce asks, “Can we take a break first?""

""Just look at those clouds!"" Tom claps Bruce on the back and keeps his hand there, between the shoulder blades. 

""Rain is coming, freezing rain, and it's not too cold now 
but once it gets cold enough, and it will - it's coming. Just wait, it's coming.""

Two days later, their cabin is buried in snow. Tom makes contact with the Overseer on the third day.

“Yes, hello? This is Tom from — hello? Can you hear me? Are you there?”

The Overseer says calmly and clearly, “The storm will pass. We’ll notify you tomorrow and let you know if it’s safe to transport the meat or not. Remember your quota.”
The storm does not pass. The cold depths of October harden into a stiff November.

“So, why’d you take the job?” Tom asks one morning as he hovers around the radio, waiting for the Overseer.

“I dunno.” Bruce stares at the wall. “I’ve worked with meat most of my life. Dad took me hunting as a boy, learned from him. Used to work at my uncle’s ranch. It’s just another contract.""

“I was working at a fishery in Alaska when the Overseer offered me this contract. I’ve done seasonal work before.”

“You from Alaska?""

""Iowa.""

""Huh. Me, too. Have you met a lot of people from this company?”

“I think the Overseer is grooming me for a management position.”

“He said I was a good candidate. For digging holes, I mean.”

Tom pauses. He looks out the window at the snow. He says, “Doesn’t look like it’s gonna slow down.”

""Give it another week.""

“I don’t have any kids. Never married, either,” Tom blurts out. “I took this job for... something. To get away. Alaska is… beautiful. You got a wife back home?”

“Nope.”

“I like you, Bruce. You’re very... agreeable. Yeah, agreeable. That’s the kind of man you are. And I admire it. You’re easy to work with. A good listener, too.”

“Thanks.”

“How come you stopped working for your uncle? I’d love to work on a ranch — all that fresh air.”

“We had a... disagreement.”

“What’s that mean?”

Bruce lifts his shoulders in a weak shrug. “You know... family.”

“We're a little under the quota, yeah?"" Tom nods to himself. ""Almost there. How many pounds? We have a contract. We need more meat.”

As soon as he makes up his mind, he moves quickly, putting on his coat and lacing his boots. Bruce watches him, unblinking.

“Tom. What are you doing?”

“My job,” Tom says, shovel in hand, and the wind slams the door behind him.

Bruce makes a pot of coffee and drinks half of it by himself, until his hands shake and his head hurts.
Tom digs. Bruce waits. And waits. Deep holes can never go deep enough. By evening, Tom comes back.

Tom takes a few squelching steps into the cabin. He wears blood: his cheeks red, his clothes drenched, his hair stuck to his scalp and beard clumped. None of the blood belongs to him.

He says, ""Hundreds of them,"" and then he collapses.

Bruce carries Tom into bed. He wets a face cloth and gently wipes the blood from around his eyes and nose.

Tom says, “So many of them.”

“I know. Go to sleep.”

“We have to meet the quota. The Overseer...""

“Okay,” Bruce says. “We will.”

He leaves Tom with the radio and a cup of coffee.

The company mascot isn’t some domestic rabbit but a wild animal. The holes were ripest when they first arrived. When he takes the shovel to the ground now, Bruce has to throw his weight against it, like gutting a deer.

He knows he’s found a good spot when he recognizes the 
smell, bright and sharp. His shovel bites into the earth. He tightens his grip, bends his knees, and lifts with his legs.

A hot spurt of gravy-thick blood gushes out.

He switches the shovel from his left to his right and digs deeper. Blood bubbles out and the snow screams.
They weren’t supposed to work in the night, when the rabbits were awake.

He grabs one by the ears and pulls it out, shrieking, spraying blood from the warren, kicking and clawing the air. He purses his lips, trying to keep the blood out of his mouth. With enough effort, he breaks through the skin of the snow and greasy ropes of gore unravel with a fecal stench of digestive juices. The fresh skin steams in the snow as white fur tries to regrow over the wounds.

Thousands of rabbits writhe in the snow.

He digs for the company. He digs and he cannot stop. Next year, there will be other men. There will be more holes. The company wants the meat, and it will get the meat.

Tom wakes to a sound like hail on the roof, and he watches as the body of a rabbit squeals across the window. At first he thinks it’s a bird, but the cabin starts to shudder under the weight. The rabbits are falling from the sky. He turns over in bed and pukes.

When he stands, the room is sideways, but he manages to stumble to the door. The seamless horizon replicates the sky; everything is white. Glistening heaps of rabbits form tumors in the fields, teeming in the graves they were torn from. For a moment, he feels weightless - stomach dropping as he floats in nothingness - and he with nausea.

He howls, “BRUCE!”

A strange echo, “TOM!”

He throws himself against the storm. He calls for Bruce until his throat is sore, and then he cries like a little boy.

He finds Bruce.

He finds Bruce's hole.

The snow trembles like a swarm of insects. He lowers himself into the hole.

""We can go fishing,"" Tom says. Bruce is cold beside him. ""I know a good place.”

The sky opens up, and from the clouds, the white rabbits fall to the tornado siren of their screams.

He kisses Bruce, and the hole fills with [blood.](https://x.com/sadappearance)",1,1735661770.0,stayawake,0,1.0,False

The best coffees I had were in Coorg and TN (on way to Pondicherry in a small hotel). In Coorg, the coffee had a slight chocolatey taste. While in TN, the coffee had a strong nutty flavour. After a lot of trial and error, I found that these ratios work for me. Coffee powder:water is 1:2.5 by weight in the steel south indian filter coffee maker. I dont add boiling water. I leave water to cool a bit for 1-1.5 minute after it has boiled. After the decoction is collected, I gently press the plunger to extract the last few drops. I boil full fat milk twice or thrice. Decoction: milk ratio is 1:5 onwards. I add very little sugar. This is fine for me as of now. But I am unable to recreate the magic of the coffee I had in TN. The tiredness after traveling in cyclone weather just vanished after the first few sips of the filter coffee. Any tips on how I can recreate it? My current filter coffee is good (way better than instant coffee) but its not as good as the coffee I had in TN or Coorg.

I am thinking to purchase the brass filter and brass dabara. I heard from my friends that brass adds a bit of metallic taste. Also in TN, coffee was served in brass dabara. Do you think this will make a difference? Currently, I am using pre-gound coffee; Sidapur 80:20 and Bayar's 80:20. I thinking to buy Timemore chestnut C2 and try making coffee using fresh grounds. What coffee brands do you recommend? How to choose the coffee beans for making filter coffee (should I look for a particular roasting level or something else)? Can I try making filter coffee with 100% coffee and no chicory using the same equipment and method?

I also heard about combining different types of coffee beans to create custom blends. I heard terms such as plantation A, plantation B, pea berry and so on. Can someone please elaborate what these terms mean and how these beans impact the final coffee. Should only arabica beans be used or can they be combined with robusta? Please suggest. Any other tips or suggestions are most welcome. Thank you!",2,1735661757.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False
