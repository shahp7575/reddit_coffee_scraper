I was thinking of making a post on coffee addiction then a thought came. Why not post it in a relevant sub (same way some people here complain about some postsüëÄ being here) then it hit me.

 No where else can you get the levels of retardedness that you'll get in this sub. 

Honestly I just want funny ahhh comments that'll make me laugh and the wazungu subs just don't do it. 

They'll prolly start advising me on my coffee intake (it's not about the coffee) meanwhile I just want to laugh about my situation ( it's my only escape from my messed up life as I'm too chicken to face the problems that I create for myself....but that's a battle for another day).

I have been married to your ghost longer than we knew each other. I wasn‚Äôt even 18 when we got married. How strange it is to see your features in our daughter‚Äôs face. She her sway when she talks the same way you used to. To look into her eyes and see a similar pattern with the exact same hue. To hear your sarcasm come out in her tone. My god you would have loved her. You would have loved the beautiful lady she growing into. Next year she herself will be 18 and I honestly don‚Äôt know how I got her here without you. How kind, thoughtful, loving and intelligent she is. I don‚Äôt know what our lives together would have looked like. I stopped imagining that stuff a long time ago. I don‚Äôt know if she will ever give us grand children but I do hope that what‚Äôs left of you in her will somehow live just a bit longer in this world. We were so young when we decided to marry. I could not for a second imagine her running across the country to marry a boy at this age. I wish we would have done things a bit differently. However I don‚Äôt think it would have changed the overall outcome of our lives. I can still picture you in the bed next to me like it was yesterday while feeling as if it never actually happened at all. I don‚Äôt talk about our anniversary anymore. I don‚Äôt make social media post or even mention the day to our daughter. I do still sit in the darkened basement digging through boxes of hand written love letters you sent me. I do still pull out the old photo albums that highlighted our most beautiful moments in our short lives together. Enough to last me a lifetime I suppose. The gift of grief is gratitude and I must say I never understood that until I lost you. Now I hug a little longer, say I love you a whole lot more often. I stop the busywork to admire the trees and grass. I sip my coffee slowly and I read every night. I miss you of course everyday. I can‚Äôt picture who you would be if you were still here. I don‚Äôt really want to imagine a version of you in anyway. You were perfectly imperfect. You loved me in a way I have never found again a way I‚Äôm sure I will never find but also one that I know for certain exists. Our last anniversary together we took a trip into the mountains and I can recall as crystal clear as ever the beautiful meteor we saw. Almost as if the universe itself was blowing us a kiss. Just a few months after that I lost you. I don‚Äôt cling to the notion that you are out there in heaven or even a ghostly roam. I just try to remember all the little pieces of yourself that you gave into me. Those small things that shaped who I am now. Those pieces that live on in her. Thank you. Thank you for existing long enough for me to know you, for me to have loved you. Most importantly thank you for loving me. Happy anniversary

The problem is that to dial in an expresso then use the same grinder to dial in expresso for a latte or mocha presents a bit of a challange.

**Current setup:**
I have a cheap grinder given to me (for free) by Preskopi, but it's on the verge of breaking.

**Beans**:
I'm currently trying Yardstick's Golden Ticket. It's decent, but my go-to coffee beans are Kafetta's Yirgacheffe.

**Scale**:
I bought a cheap scale with a timer, but after 7 months, it's already broken.

**Brewing method**:
I'm using an Aeropress and following James Hoffman's recipe with a few small adjustments to suit my taste.

What I'm considering:

**Manual espresso machine**: I'm thinking about getting either a Cafelat Robot or one of the Flair models (Neo, Classic, or 58).

**Grinder**: I‚Äôm torn between going for an electric grinder like the DF64 or opting for a manual hand grinder (considering options like the Kingrinder K6, 1Zpresso, or Timemore C3).

**Scale**: Can you recommend a durable, reliable scale? It doesn't matter if it has a timer or not, as long as it lasts.


**Beans**:
I'm open to suggestions! I'm still exploring and would love to hear your favorites.

**Tools/Accessories**:
Feel free to suggest any other tools or accessories you think would complement my setup!

I primarily brew americano-style coffee using the Aeropress, but I also enjoy espresso (or something close to it). I'm not really into milk-based drinks.

I prefer manual brewing since I'm just a home brewer, but I might consider an automatic espresso machine/grinder if it offers consistent results.

**Budget**:
I have a budget of around 50k PHP. It doesn‚Äôt have to be fully spent‚ÄîI'm looking for the best value for money, so I'm open to going higher or lower depending on the cost-effectiveness of the items.",1,1729817008.0,CoffeePH,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm not exactly sure how to count my weeks now but I‚Äôm going to use Thursdays and my very first starting week. üòÇ about 10 or so days ago I went off bupropion which made me super sad. It still does because it was really helping my mood and so far the fluoxetine just isn‚Äôt quite as helpful but it‚Äôs a super tiny dose. The tinnitus that forced me off the bupropion since I couldn‚Äôt rule out the bupropion is still there. If it doesn‚Äôt go away in a few months I might just see if f I can go back on. 

Anyway, I continued the metformin and naltrexone. I received kit 5 on Monday and got permission to continue the naltrexone and the metformin and just add in the topiramate. I went ahead and started the 1/2 tab at night in case I‚Äôm a drowsy one. I‚Äôve had 2 doses so far and no issues but we will see! I maybe have a little metallic taste in my mouth but all foods taste the same. I would say I‚Äôm the same hungry but not struggling to limit portions, etc so hopefully it only continues. :-) 

I did start a slew of vitamins. I know topiramate can cause hair loss so I started biotin, a multivitamin and some supplements that may help with tinnitus since I‚Äôm aware and it‚Äôs sort of annoying now that I think about it more than occasionally. üòÇ 

I lost 2.4 pounds this week!! Yay!! Any constipation issues I had from the bupropion have resolved. I am drinking one 8oz cup of coffee each morning now that I‚Äôm off the bupropion as well. I just put some vanilla best drink ever powder in it for 60 cal so not too shabby. 

I have not yet introduced exercise. I hurt my back Sunday moving something I shouldn‚Äôt have. But mostly because I look for ANY excuse to not. I used to run an hour 4 days a week so it‚Äôs extremely difficult to get over the fact I can barely walk now. I saw a post earlier about someone doing exercise snacks so I‚Äôm going to try the same. 5 squats and 5 walk planks any time I pee. And I really need to add stretches for my back. 

Anyway‚Ä¶there ya go! All is good! No symptoms, trying out kit 5, wishing I could be on bupropion and still loosing pounds! :-) 

All the best! Stay positive and remember don‚Äôt compare yourself to anyone but yourself!!!!

1gbhw7e,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1gbhw7e/beware_of_intentional_breakups_a_note_on_the/,Beware of 'intentional' breakups: a note on the difference between sweet/kind people and good people,"First a disclaimer.  A friend recently went through an 'intentional' breakup and had what sounds to me like a better experience with it not just than mine, but a better experience that way than most people have generally... so as ever YMMV.    
  
\*My\* experience was not positive.  I was with my partner for nearly five years, and thought she was my person.  We were friends first and we were a great fit.  That said she has an avoidant attachment style, or at least did with me, and attempted to break up with me on average once a year.  But I'll also note that she was always very gentle, kind, compassionate, and most couples would be shocked to see what an 'argument' between us looked like -- neither of us ever raised our voices, or even so much as took a tone.  

Things took a turn after covid.  She was struggling with depression and from her end our relationship felt stale and unfulfilling, and while we did have unaddressed problems, I know it was irresponsible and cruel of her to just end things without so much as a conversation.  But what turned out to be truly cruel was her methodology.  Someone, I think a therapist, turned her on to the idea of intentional breakups: where you talk about it, plan for it, and slowly peel connections back, sort of like being flayed alive except it's for your heart.  

In the midst of tears she said 'I don't want anything to change,' which in that precise moment was at least partially true.  She broke up with me midday, we spent a couple hours on a couch which to me felt like mostly me consoling her, and then spoke on the phone for at least an hour that night.  The next day we got lunch together and I think went back to her place to watch some shows or a movie.  

For the next three months we behaved nearly like a couple, just little physical intimacy (there was some kissing and cuddling the first few weeks, which, crazy I know, and I'm just as responsible for). Texting and talking every day, seeing each other a couple or a few times a week, etc.  

However, no conversation about what was going on, or about scaling things back, or the breakup, or what the heck was going on now.  Until one day she was putting a new bed frame together, and I offered to help, and brought over a coffee.  She had said that she could find another friend to help, but I said no I'd be happy to.  

At some point that day she said 'sometimes you do things only a boyfriend should do.'  I was gutted.  Floored.  Heartbroken.  Coincidentally and unbeknownst to me, she had recently met a guy at a wedding, three hours away, and they had hit it off.  They were dating as I pieced together later.  She just basically decided 'it would be hard for me to be honest so I'll say insanely confusing and hurtful things instead of sharing what's going on.'

We saw each other less and less, spoke less, texted less, then she ghosted.  We did eventually reconnect, because I'm a nincompoop and reached out, and a loose, pretty much texting-only friendship ensued until she ghosted again.  

The key things missing for us if she wanted this 'intentional' breakup were: 1) a plan and 2) communication.   I basically just served as her surrogate boyfriend, making her decision to dump me as easy as possible for her and 10X more painful for me than it needed to be.  

This woman is very sweet.  Charming.  Funny.  She is a kind person.  The entirety of the way she handled our breakup highlighted for me that kindness, while a positive trait, is a subset or style of charm, and charm is by definition superficial.  Kindness is not a function of doing the right thing or doing right by someone, it's a function of social utility.  

Anyway if you're going to do an intentional breakup maybe that will work for you, but put a plan in place and checkin with each other, often.  Maybe when it's done well it pans out better than a 'normal' breakup.  But when it's done poorly... boy, will it smart.  For one party.  The other gets to have a field day at your expense.  More fundamentally, while there's no need to be wary of kind people (and indeed I think we may be running short on kindness these days), always be aware that there's a distinction between kindness and goodness.  A person who tends to be kind doesn't want to hurt your and want you to feel warm fuzzies, which is great.  A good person wants what is best for you -- not ahead of their own interests, but in the context of a breakup they will want what is best for you, whether it is kind or not.  

P.S. - just go no contact.  Truly.  Respect yourself.

# Apple And Goldman Sachs Ordered To Pay more Than $89 Million For Apple Card Failures

Apple‚Äôs reputation for intuitive design hit a snag with its Apple Card.¬†

Partnering with Goldman Sachs, Apple aimed to streamline credit card use, but the user experience didn't live up to expectations. The result? A hefty $89 million fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) for mishandling consumer disputes and misleading customers about interest-free installment plans.

The fines, split between Apple and Goldman, come after issues that affected thousands of Apple Card users, particularly around dispute resolution and installment payment options.

**Where Apple Fell Short**  
  
At the heart of the problem was Apple's design for reporting billing errors. The process was supposed to be seamless, but many users were left frustrated when additional forms were required, and disputes weren‚Äôt properly sent to Goldman Sachs for investigation.¬†

On top of that, Apple‚Äôs checkout process confused customers by not making it clear they needed to opt into interest-free payments for Apple products. This led to unexpected interest charges for many.

**Goldman‚Äôs Role in the Mess**

Goldman Sachs didn‚Äôt escape the CFPB‚Äôs scrutiny either.¬†

The bank faced a slew of complaints over how it handled disputes once they were forwarded by Apple. Many disputes weren‚Äôt acknowledged within 30 days, and investigations often fell short of federal standards.¬†

The situation was worsened by Goldman‚Äôs failure to communicate how refunds and interest-free payments would work, leading some customers to rack up unnecessary interest.

While both Apple and Goldman have taken steps to resolve these issues, this situation serves as a cautionary tale about the risks of over-promising simplicity in financial products.

# TKO Group To Acquire 3 Businesses From Endeavor For $3.25 billion

TKO Group, the owner of UFC and WWE, just went shopping‚Äîand they didn‚Äôt hold back.¬†

In a $3.25 billion all-stock deal, TKO is scooping up three sports-related businesses from Endeavor Group: Professional Bull Riders (PBR), On Location, and IMG. Not only does this bolster TKO‚Äôs portfolio, but it also pushes Endeavor‚Äôs ownership stake in the company from 53% to a commanding 59%.

The deal isn‚Äôt just about grabbing new leagues. TKO‚Äôs getting a piece of the action in premium hospitality (On Location) and sports media rights (IMG). This move positions them as a heavyweight not only in sports leagues but in everything from ticket sales to media strategy. Sounds like TKO is aiming for a bigger slice of the sports entertainment pie.

**TKO's Stock Buyback and Dividends: Sweet Deal for Investors**  
  
Along with the big buy, TKO is treating its shareholders to a little extra love. The company announced plans to buy back up to $2 billion in stock and kick off quarterly dividends of $75 million.¬†

That's a solid move considering TKO's cash-generating capabilities, and it sends a clear signal: they‚Äôre serious about rewarding their investors.

TKO‚Äôs shares took a dip following the news, sliding 5.9% in early trading, but the long-term play seems geared toward solid growth. With UFC and WWE already under their belt, adding PBR and IMG only deepens TKO‚Äôs stronghold on live sports and media rights.

**What‚Äôs Next for TKO?**  
  
As TKO‚Äôs President, Mark Shapiro, pointed out, this is no small acquisition. PBR hosts over 200 events a year, while On Location is known for luxe packages at major sports spectacles like the Super Bowl and FIFA World Cup.¬†

IMG, on the other hand, is a major player in media rights deals for everything from the NFL to the English Premier League. That means TKO is moving beyond just operating leagues‚Äîthey‚Äôre stepping into a full-scale sports entertainment empire.

No more shopping from Endeavor, though‚Äîat least for now. Shapiro made it clear that TKO‚Äôs not looking to buy more assets from its parent company.¬†

But as Endeavor goes private, TKO seems primed to snatch up other opportunities in the sports and entertainment world, positioning themselves as a giant in the industry.

While both Apple and Goldman have taken steps to resolve these issues, this situation serves as a cautionary tale about the risks of over-promising simplicity in financial products.

# TKO Group To Acquire 3 Businesses From Endeavor For $3.25 billion

TKO Group, the owner of UFC and WWE, just went shopping‚Äîand they didn‚Äôt hold back.¬†

In a $3.25 billion all-stock deal, TKO is scooping up three sports-related businesses from Endeavor Group: Professional Bull Riders (PBR), On Location, and IMG. Not only does this bolster TKO‚Äôs portfolio, but it also pushes Endeavor‚Äôs ownership stake in the company from 53% to a commanding 59%.

The deal isn‚Äôt just about grabbing new leagues. TKO‚Äôs getting a piece of the action in premium hospitality (On Location) and sports media rights (IMG). This move positions them as a heavyweight not only in sports leagues but in everything from ticket sales to media strategy. Sounds like TKO is aiming for a bigger slice of the sports entertainment pie.

**TKO's Stock Buyback and Dividends: Sweet Deal for Investors**  
  
Along with the big buy, TKO is treating its shareholders to a little extra love. The company announced plans to buy back up to $2 billion in stock and kick off quarterly dividends of $75 million.¬†

That's a solid move considering TKO's cash-generating capabilities, and it sends a clear signal: they‚Äôre serious about rewarding their investors.

TKO‚Äôs shares took a dip following the news, sliding 5.9% in early trading, but the long-term play seems geared toward solid growth. With UFC and WWE already under their belt, adding PBR and IMG only deepens TKO‚Äôs stronghold on live sports and media rights.

**What‚Äôs Next for TKO?**  
  
As TKO‚Äôs President, Mark Shapiro, pointed out, this is no small acquisition. PBR hosts over 200 events a year, while On Location is known for luxe packages at major sports spectacles like the Super Bowl and FIFA World Cup.¬†

IMG, on the other hand, is a major player in media rights deals for everything from the NFL to the English Premier League. That means TKO is moving beyond just operating leagues‚Äîthey‚Äôre stepping into a full-scale sports entertainment empire.

No more shopping from Endeavor, though‚Äîat least for now. Shapiro made it clear that TKO‚Äôs not looking to buy more assets from its parent company.¬†

But as Endeavor goes private, TKO seems primed to snatch up other opportunities in the sports and entertainment world, positioning themselves as a giant in the industry.

Should I ask for clairty?,"My head has been going in circles for the past 2 months and I thought this would be a good way to get some advice/outsider POVs of the situation. A little background to start:
Last summer, my co-worker (who is also a close friend), Sam, got his best friend, Tom, a job at our coffee shop while he was out of school. Our friend group became close friends with him and hung out all summer - having movie nights, going to each other's houses, etc. During the time he was working at the cafe, Tom would express how much he liked working with me and how funny he thought I was. He even told me one time that he thinks I'm the funniest person he ever met. I developed a little bit of a crush on him but ultimately did nothing about it because he did have a girlfriend of a few months. We enjoyed our summer and eventually, he went back to school. The next time I would see him was when I hosted Friendsgiving and Friendsmas at my house, which he would come to without his girlfriend. 
Fast forward to this past May. He and his girlfriend broke up and all I had heard was that it wasn't a good ending to their relationship. I was shocked that they weren't together anymore but didn't think much about it since I didn't see him much anymore. The only interaction I got from him was him liking some of my IG stories. 
Fast forwarding to the beginning of July. I like to run and sometimes post my Strava logs onto my IG story for fun. Tom had replied to my story asking about my running, and I replied not thinking much of it. But then he had kept the conversation going. He was asking me how work was since he left, where I wanted to move in the future, what I wanted to do with my life and things like that. I still hadn't thought too deeply about it and just thought he wanted to catch up as a friend. The conversation naturally ended and that was it. Until he texted me the next morning and once again started up a conversation. Now I knew that he had some sort of intention coming into this, and I was a bit weary knowing that he just got out of a messy relationship. But I knew how he talked about me to other people and how he viewed me as a friend, so I was (and still am) sure that he wasn't using me as some sort of ""rebound"" opportunity.  About 2 weeks later, we were still texting all day every day -but never had a conversation about what was going on. He was coming back into town and asked that we have a movie night at our friend Sarah's (who is Sam's GF), house like we always used to. I thought that him coming back to town would allow us to hang out and talk, but we didn't. While he was still here, he would come by my work to get coffee and hang out at the cafe, and he even came by one time as soon as I was done my shift to ask if I wanted to go for a walk. We did and it was really nice, I was super nervous but it also felt very natural and comfortable. He went back to school that night and we continued to talk.
He came back to town the following week and asked our friends to hang out at Sarah's again, which we did and things were still really good. He would text me to make sure I got home and we continued to talk into the early morning. He came by my work again and was there for a few hours. He went back to school and about a week later I noticed things started to change. He had expressed to our friends and me that he wasn't doing well mentally. He said that he needed to spend time away from social media and his phone in general so if he doesn't answer me on specific things, that's why. We were still talking everyday, just not as often. It was a bit saddening to me, considering how emotional and personal some of our conversations would get, and now its not like that at all. I understand his need though and what he needs to do for himself, so I tried to not let it bother me that much. He had also opened up to me a couple of times about his breakup and how his girlfriend really messed him up and how she treated him - which made me understand him at the moment. At the end of August, I had finally asked him what was going on. He told me that he truly needs to not be on his phone for a bit and it has nothing to do with me. He then said that he would like to take things seriously if things were to progress, but it's not in his cards and we should be friends. This hurt a lot. Considering he started all of it and never brought up his intentions, this was the first actual conversation we had about it. I quickly said its all good and I'm glad he is being honest, and left the conversation at him saying thank you for bringing it up. 
It took me a couple of weeks to get over it, although I still think about it often, but over these 2 months he has still been liking my strava runs and had even liked my comment on Sarah's IG post. There has been no other communication otherwise. Until his bday. I decided that I would reach out and wish him a happy birthday and that I hope he is doing well. He replied saying thank you and that he hopes I am doing well also. Then 2 minutes later sends me a picture of the moon. This confused me because it's something we'd do a lot. I love the moon and he knows that, so when it was out and looking pretty he'd always send me a picture of it. I don't know what message he was trying to convey with this, but I just liked the photo. No conversation after this.
I wasn't sure if I should have addressed this but just decided to leave it. Sarah had said that she truly thinks Tom really likes me and didn't want to pursue something further if he couldn't give his 100%. She had told me that Sam talked to him and basically said to not mess around with me and take it seriously, so I know his intentions weren't bad from the beginning. Sarah had also told me how (before any of this happened) every time her and Sam were hanging out with Tom, he would tell them how much he adored me and thought I was so special. Tom also texted Sarah once something random about me that he thought was funny out of the blue. I also think that he had/has feelings for me but realized that he isn't healed and that he shouldn't have started something with me so soon and abruptly. 
I know I'm going to eventually see him sometime in the future so I need some advice as to where to go from here. I never got any closure or clarity on this situation and feel like I need it, but since he was the once who pulled away I feel like I cant.",1,1729815661.0,situationshipsadvice,0,1.0,False

My case is weird in that: I‚Äôve slept with a lot of different women, but the closest I‚Äôve come to an actual GF was a girl that I dated for a little over a year. We went on adventures and did a lot of the things that couples do, but we were never exclusive and both dated other people during that time frame. I always accepted this because: due to being in the military at the time, we were living on opposite coasts of the US and only met in person on a monthly basis. Even though the physical attraction was there, I also saw things about her that deterred me from wanting to make her my GF. (I met her via Hinge as well as the majority of the women I slept with)

In hindsight, I regret my decision to be so sexually active. Once the novelty of sex wore off, I began to feel worse about myself after each new encounter and the reality of the risks of casual sex became more apparent. I also became embarrassed by the number of women I‚Äôd slept with. I can‚Äôt even recall one third of their names. This feeling was especially amplified when I looked around and noticed a lot of my peers were getting married, having kids, etc; while I was chasing random sex. The only real positive that came out of the experience is that it showed me that there‚Äôs a significant amount of women I‚Äôm attracted to who find me sexually attractive in return, which gave me a bit more confidence. I often justified my decision to be promiscuous by the fact that I was in the military, which made normal dating a bit more challenging. 

Where we‚Äôre at now: I‚Äôm out of the military and work as a pilot. Things I‚Äôve done to meet women and put myself out there: Be active on Hinge, hang out/do work at coffee shops every so often, go to live music shows, attend yoga classes routinely, lift weights at the gym, and I tried out a run club or two(I don‚Äôt enjoy long distance running so I stopped). In general, I‚Äôve tried to make an effort to leave the house and engage in activities that I enjoy: I‚Äôm passionate about surfing and guitar as well. I‚Äôve even considered going out for an intramural sport that I enjoy, but that‚Äôs a large time commitment. 

As much as I dislike Hinge and dating apps, I do see the occasional success stories. It also does have its pros. It seems like every woman I see in public that I‚Äôm interested in is either married or has a bf. Then, a lot of the women who have taken a liking to me and who have approached me in the settings above, are women that I‚Äôm just not physically attracted to. The biggest thing to be mindful of with the apps is that they should be used as an addition to what you‚Äôre already doing in person, not a substitute. At this point, I do receive a lot of matches on them, but less than 3% turn into in person dates. 

Do you all have any advice or words of encouragement? At this point, I feel like I‚Äôm spinning in circles a bit and am running short on ideas of ways to better put myself out there. Finding and maintaining a relationship seems so much more complex in today‚Äôs dating world. ",1,1729815341.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

No medications; I take multivitamins, fiber supplements, and fish oil

Pre-diabetic, but otherwise clean comprehensive blood panel as of late June.

I've lost almost 60lbs in about 18 months. I was eating at a pretty consistent caloric deficit, but without paying enough attention to actual nutrition. I'm trying to correct that now, but I can't figure out why the left side of my face keeps twitching (eye and upper cheek).

I remember noticing the twitching getting worse around May. But it can stay for a day and then quiet the next. I can't really figure out any rhythm to it. 

At first, I thought too much coffee. I've cut that down to just one day a week. I work out 3-4 days a week, so I thought maybe electrolytes. I salt my morning water and try to have a sports drink after a workout, but it twitched a lot today even though I haven't worked out in four days. I've been getting better with my sleeping habits too, as I thought that may have been a factor. Even when I'm slept up, it twitches (like today). Even Googling stuff like calcium deficiency can have that symptom, and I was eating hardly any dairy, so I have cheese sticks with breakfast regularly. Even when I work more potassium (bananas and spinach) into my diet, I've noticed the twitching.

I can't figure out what causes it to start or stop. Where would you look next? Could it have anything to do with blood sugar? I have doc appointments scheduled but after New Years.

I was a scene kid growing up. I had crazy dyed hair, wore makeup and in hindsight probably took it all a bit too far. BUT, I was ME, unapologetically ME.

Fast forward to my early 30s and I just feel deflated. Over time, all my friends branched off and disappeared into their own lives.

My alarm goes off at 7:30 every morning, but I always turn it off and end up getting out of bed after 9. Whenever I do get out of bed, I just feel exhausted and poorly rested. I drag myself downstairs where I will drink a coffee and smoke three cigarettes. 

I will then scroll political sites and forums to get updates on all of the doom and gloom of the political world, I know it is bad for my mental health but I am addicted to it. I guess I‚Äôm just hoping to read about a miracle that has happened that will make things better. 

I will then call up any member of the family who will answer because it is an excuse to talk, pass time, moan about the world and problems , drink coffee and smoke more. 

Will then watch porn, something which honestly gives no pleasure these days and just makes me feel worse afterwards. 

Then it will be more couch sitting, doom scrolling, looking at old photos of happier times (which just makes me more miserable because those days aren‚Äôt coming back), watching youtube and endlessly browsing eBay and other buying sites for things that I can‚Äôt afford. 

Youtube video watching passive. I will  watch the same youtube video three times in a row, and then search channels I am subscribed to to see if they have anything new out. Even if they don‚Äôt, I will watch their latest video three or four times. 

Probably more porn and cigarettes mixed in throughout the rest of the day, with another healthy dose of political doom scrolling and eBay dreaming. 

I know all of this is a form of escapism, because  I am so miserable in my current state. 

Breakfast and lunch are usually skipped, and because of that I will end up ordering a takeaway in the evening, which adds more to my misery as I am getting fatter. 

More youtube and eBay dreaming. 

Then I will shower and go to bed, where I will lie for hours unable to sleep whilst my mind is wide awake and my thoughts usually trail towards death which will then cause anxiety attacks. 

I know that a lot of my inactivity comes from overthinking - each thing I want to do seems to be dependent on another thing, which in turn is dependent on something else, which requires three more things to be done, which then ties back to the first thing I wanted to do.

https://preview.redd.it/t3yziof3iswd1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=554efbf4cd20ad8b1b9243f7cbab9bf49e863278

In today's fast-paced business world, efficiency is king. But what happens *after* you've streamlined operations and optimized workflows? That's where the real magic happens ‚Äì client retention. While virtual assistants (VAs) are renowned for boosting productivity, their role in keeping clients coming back for more is often overlooked. This article delves into how the top virtual assistant services go above and beyond to foster lasting client relationships and drive business growth.

Think of your favorite coffee shop. It's not just about the caffeine fix, is it? It's the friendly barista who remembers your order, the cozy ambiance, and the sense of community that keeps you returning. Similarly, client retention isn't solely about ticking tasks off a list; it's about building genuine connections and exceeding expectations.

Top-tier VA services understand this. They don't just offer administrative support or calendar management; they act as an extension of your team, embodying your brand values and fostering genuine relationships with your clients. Let's explore the key strategies these VAs employ to cultivate loyalty and drive repeat business.

# Personalized Communication: The Cornerstone of Client Retention

Imagine receiving a birthday email from a company you haven't interacted with in months. It's a small gesture, but it makes you feel valued, right? That's the power of personalized communication. Leading VA services prioritize understanding your clients' individual needs and preferences. They tailor every interaction, from email correspondence to customer support, ensuring each client feels seen and heard.

For instance, a VA specializing in client retention might segment your customer base and craft targeted email campaigns based on purchase history or engagement levels. They could even send personalized thank-you notes or small gifts to show appreciation for your clients' continued support.

# Proactive Problem Solving: Anticipating Needs Before They Arise

Exceptional VAs don't just react to problems; they actively seek to prevent them. By monitoring customer feedback, analyzing data, and staying ahead of industry trends, they can identify potential pain points and address them proactively.

Let's say you run an e-commerce store. A client retention-focused VA might notice an uptick in complaints about shipping delays. Instead of simply responding to individual complaints, they could proactively investigate the issue, identify the root cause, and work with your shipping provider to find a solution. This not only resolves the immediate problem but also prevents future dissatisfaction, fostering client trust and loyalty.

# Building Relationships That Last: Going Beyond Transactions

In an era of automation and impersonal interactions, human connection is more valuable than ever. Top VA services prioritize building genuine relationships with your clients, going beyond transactional interactions to create a sense of community and belonging.

This could involve actively engaging with clients on social media, responding to comments and messages promptly, and participating in online forums or communities relevant to your industry. By fostering a sense of connection and building rapport, VAs can transform satisfied customers into loyal brand advocates.

# Continuous Improvement: The Key to Long-Term Success

The best VA services are committed to continuous improvement. They regularly solicit feedback from clients, track key performance indicators (KPIs), and adapt their strategies to ensure they're consistently exceeding expectations.

This commitment to excellence not only strengthens client relationships but also drives business growth. By continuously optimizing their services and staying ahead of the curve, these VAs help you stay competitive in today's dynamic market.

In conclusion, while efficiency remains crucial, client retention is the true linchpin of sustainable business growth. By investing in top-tier virtual assistant services that prioritize personalized communication, proactive problem-solving, relationship building, and continuous improvement, you can cultivate a loyal customer base and unlock long-term success. Remember, it's not just about getting things done; it's about creating an experience that keeps clients coming back for more.

I'm getting to the point where it will probably be time to upgrade/replace my NAS pretty soon.

I've been using the Western Digital PR2100 two-bay setup with a pair of 14tb WD Red drives in RAID-1 configuration for many years now but I'm getting close to finally filling it up (maybe time to switch to a 4bay to future-proof my setup a little?) and I know its age is probably not doing me any favors either.

Also everyone shits on WD, and it's the only one I've ever had so I am anxious to try whatever is apparently better.

As far as usage, I am on a MacBook (although I'm still fairly new to macs, just switched last year), I use the drive as my primary storage for everything since my computer has a dinky little nothing hard drive that's only suitable for program files. 

The vast majority of what it gets used for are:

1. My Plex library/server (~4000 titles) used basically just by me, but every so often a friend will log in there remotely to watch something or I will when traveling.

2. My Photoshop files (tons of VERY large .psb files and .jpgs) that don't live on the laptop because they'd eat it alive, and don't live on portable drives because I hate versioning and copying and the resulting confusion and time it takes, so I just want to have one version that lives remotely and can be accessed from any location, so if I'm traveling or even just at a coffee shop, I can still work.


I'm the only user of any of this stuff, and I'm really not techie at all, so definitely not after something I have to build or really something that would require me be very knowledgeable about setup, I just want simplicity, reliability, tons of storage, and easy remote access.

[The entire NAS is perpetually backed up to the Livedrive cloud backup service, and I use the Proton VPN service on my computer, in case either of those details has any implication on compatibility.] 

Considering how many years I'll be in bed with this decision, I just want to make sure I choose the right thing.

Julien's music has become so important to me in the last couple years, but I've never been someone who went to concerts much. I feel like I finally get it. Her music makes me feel so seen and understood. I've spent the last year going to an open mic every Monday and playing covers in a coffee shop basement, and about half the time the songs are hers. 

I've never been a writer, but having words to sing that feel so true to myself and feel so valid has led to me finally feeling comfortable writing some of my own words down. I'm nowhere near comfortable or confident enough in it for that stuff to be perceived yet, but I don't know if I ever would've gotten there if not for Julien Baker. I'm so so grateful.

I was worried for a while that I might not fit or belong at one of her shoes just because I'm a straitish man, but I've at least gotten to the point that I know that's dumb.

1gbgyfx,https://www.reddit.com/r/krakow/comments/1gbgyfx/experience_at_shed_krakow_a_warning_for_future/,"Experience at SHED Krakow: A Warning for Future Students
","So, writing this feedback wasn‚Äôt exactly on my bucket list, but here we are. Honestly, I don‚Äôt want other students to go through the rollercoaster ride we did at **SHED Dormitory Cracow**. Who wants their European adventure spoiled by a bunch of unprofessional folks?

From day one, they showed us exactly what they were about. When my roommate and I asked to see some nice rooms with a view, we were met with a response that could only be described as a cold slap: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not your personal assistants.‚Äù It felt more like they were saying, ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt like it, good luck finding somewhere else.‚Äù But hey, maybe they just had a rough morning. We decided to give them the benefit of the doubt.

Once we finally settled in, that‚Äôs when the real circus began. Here‚Äôs the full rundown of the chaos:

1. **Management:** If you‚Äôre looking for a textbook example of customer service, look elsewhere. The management here could give a masterclass in how to ignore complaints. You could repeat your issues ten times, and it felt like you were talking to a wall. I half expect to see them at the next ‚ÄúHow Not to Manage a Dorm‚Äù seminar. Seriously, if someone in a higher position reads this, please reconsider the management you‚Äôve assigned to handle 700 students. They need a serious refresher course on how to actually help people.
2. **Noise Levels:** Now, I know dorms can be loud‚Äîtrust me, I‚Äôve been there‚Äîbut this place took it to a whole new level. I‚Äôve never heard such a party atmosphere in a study space. Imagine trying to focus on your assignments while the common area turns into a nightclub, complete with music blasting until the wee hours. ‚ÄúHey, can you guys turn it down a notch?‚Äù we kindly asked. Their reply? ‚ÄúIf it bothers you, maybe just switch rooms.‚Äù So, instead of addressing the problem, their solution was to just shove us somewhere else. I guess keeping 15 people happy is too much of a hassle. When we asked security to handle the noise situation, it was like trying to get a cat to take a bath. Good luck with that.
3. **Fridge Situation:** Let‚Äôs talk about the fridge situation. For the lovely price of around 3000 PLN for our room, you‚Äôd think we‚Äôd get a decent mini-fridge, right? Nope. Instead, we were gifted with a mini-fridge. Our food had to take refuge in the huge common fridge, which felt more like a game of food hide-and-seek, despite all the cameras keeping an eye on us like Big Brother; unfortunately, they were more likely made by 5-minute crafts kinds of stuff like never useful but always there. Twice, our food mysteriously disappeared. When we asked them to check the cameras, they just shrugged it off like it was no big deal. If you enjoy the game of ‚ÄúGuess Where‚Äôs My Dinner Now?"" this is the place for you.
4. **Room and Bed Sizes:** You know those rooms they advertise for two people? Well, they clearly have a different definition of cozy. The bed size was more appropriate for one person‚Äîdefinitely not meant for two people. And guess what? No air conditioning in a brand-new 2023 building. Who needs cool air when you can just sweat it out, right? We had to buy a fan that could probably power a small country just to survive the heat. At this rate, I might as well invest in a portable sauna.
5. **Walls:** The walls here are practically made of tissue paper. You can hear everything. I once overheard my neighbor discussing their life choices and questionable music choices. And don‚Äôt even get me started on the sounds coming from their night dance. It was like living next to a live performance of a very questionable nature. Privacy? What‚Äôs that?
6. **Safety Issues:** Based on my deep dive into Google reviews, I discovered that one of the reception guy seems to have taken on the role of a reality TV producer. Apparently, this guy was caught watching the gym girls on the cameras and then knocking on doors late at night. It was like he was trying to deliver some kind of questionable service. Professional training before the job? Nope, Thanks. We were charged around a lovely 3K PLN every month, and on top of that, if your guest overstayed their welcome by three days, you got hit with an extra fee for ‚Äúsecurity.‚Äù Meanwhile, they had this guest list that felt more like a bad joke than a real security measure. It‚Äôs as if they thought, ‚ÄúWho needs real safety when we can just add more fees?‚Äù Despite this being a student dorm, they turned all the empty summer rooms into hotel rooms, transforming our home into a makeshift motel where anything could happen.

Now, picture this scenario: it‚Äôs 3 AM, and you‚Äôre trying to work in a glass-walled room that‚Äôs supposed to be a sanctuary of peace. Suddenly, two middle-aged guys are banging on the glass like they‚Äôre auditioning for the next big action flick. As the reception escorted them away, they staggered down the hall, looking like they were in an eating contest gone wrong. Honestly, it was one of the most surreal sights‚Äîthese dudes were clearly under the influence of some wild kind of drugs, probably bad decisions, and way too much junk food. The receptionist said they were ‚Äúhotel guests,‚Äù which felt like a punchline to a really bad joke about 700 students secure. I wish I had Will Smith with **neuralyzer** at that time; maybe it helped me erase that moment from my entire memory.   
  
Meanwhile, let‚Äôs talk about the security measures in place. Your friend had to wait at the door like we were auditioning for a secret society. Just put the fires on the bag, man. Named this security but let an unknown bazillion middle-aged sweet van man-type people live at the same time with students. Not Cool  
  
Then, there was one tenant who had quite the experience in his room. Imagine this: You're in the room with confidence because you're sure you locked your door. What could happen, right? But then the cleaning lady, key card in hand, walked into your small room and saw you naked. It‚Äôs a wonder she didn‚Äôt hand him a towel and invite him in for a waltz. Don't ask why he is naked in his room.



**7. Unprofessional Behavior:** With the exception of a 2 of lovely staff members at reception, the rest acted like they were auditioning for a soap opera with their eye rolls and dramatic sighs whenever you asked for help. It felt like they were sharing your personal info over coffee breaks just for kicks. If you need a lesson in how to not take your job seriously, this is the place to learn it. When I tried to get some basic information, it was like asking a cat for directions. So many blank stares and ignoring sounds. It was almost impressive.  


**8. Elevators:** For over half of our stay, at least three out of the four elevators were out of service. I can‚Äôt even count how many times I ended up on the stairs, lugging my bags up and down like I was Sisyphus. If you want a workout while trying to get to your room, this place supports a healthy life. Just don‚Äôt forget your water bottle. It became a daily routine, waiting for an elevator that rarely arrived, and when it did, it was like winning the lottery.

And here‚Äôs the cherry on top: after our contract ended, they tried to sneak in a clause that basically said, ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt want to end up in the Bad Review Hall of Fame, keep your mouth shut.‚Äù What a creative way to avoid accountability. They even threatened me with an email after I shared my honest feedback online. It‚Äôs like they think we‚Äôre too scared to speak up in Two Thousand Twenty-four

It‚Äôs such a shame to deal with this kind of unprofessionalism, especially in a country that values freedom of speech. If only management could turn complaints into actual improvements, they‚Äôd be the talk of the town‚Äîminus the eye rolls.

I really hope no student has to go through this while trying to enjoy one of the most exciting times of their lives. Do your homework before picking a place to stay, and for the love of all things good, steer clear of places like Shed Co-Living. Your future self will thank you :)",1,1729813859.0,krakow,3,0.66,False

To be honest, I don't think I've ever had a conversation with any one of my neighbors. But to my defense, my neighborhood isn't built like a traditional neighborhood.



I live in Castro Valley. Emphasis on the ""valley."" The entire town is built on hills. The block I live on resembles more of a roller coaster than a street. I wish I could say you get used to living like this, but you don't. My house is smack in the middle of a hill; and after a decade of living here, I've discovered that I'm a ""house half uphill"" kind of guy.



My ten-year-old son, Cooper, loves it here. There's a single-screen movie theater down the street, next door to that is a comic book shop, across the street is an ice cream parlor, and a few blocks over is Golfland. I'm convinced that Castro Valley was designed by a child.



Cooper had overheard my wife and I talking about how unfriendly our neighborhood felt and he had an idea of how we could do our part in fixing it. When he visits my mother-in-law, they like to go on walks. I guess a neighbor of hers has one of those Little Free Library things in their front yard. The mailbox looking thing that the owner fills with books, and anyone walking by is encouraged to trade one of their own books for one in the library. Cooper said we could fill it with all of our favorite books, so our neighbors could get to know us a little better.



He had spring break coming up, and I had vacation days lying around, so I planned on taking the week off to spend with him. I figured building the library was a great opportunity for a father-son project.



The sun was setting, and admittedly, it may have taken a little longer than anticipated to build, but there it was nonetheless. We took a step back and admired the little library that was now standing firmly in our yard. I handed him a paintbrush and told him that all the library was missing was a name. He gave it some thought, then started with the brush. When he moved away, I could see that he painted ""Greenridge Road Library"" in big green letters. Fittingly named after the street we live on.



The next day, I peeled myself off of my mattress and dragged my feet into the kitchen. Cooper was sitting on the couch, fully dressed, shoes tied, hair brushed, ready to go. I have weird attachments to all of Cooper's stuff. He's our only child, so every little thing of his is tethered to precious memories. I couldn't just let him put his books, which my wife and I read to him over the years, outside for strangers to take. So, I told him we would go to the bookstore to get new books to use.



Before we left, Cooper ran over to check our Greenridge Road Library. I hurried to catch up to him when I saw him jumping up and down with excitement. He screamed ""Dad! Dad! Look!"" And to my surprise, there was already a book sitting inside of the little library, patiently waiting for us to adopt it.



It was a Penguin Random House children's book titled: ""How to Swim and Dive."" It was a cute, little, vintage, book about learning how to swim. And even though it was covered in a clear, but yellowing, protective jacket; the book was extremely weathered. It looked decades old. The style of the cover art and pictures throughout the pages made me think it may be midcentury era. The once bright colored spine was cracking and had a slight tear through the ""V"" in the book name, giving it the new title: ""How to Swim and Die."" That got a guilty chuckle out of me. 



The book jacket proudly wore a sticker for the Hayward Public Library. Hayward is Castro Valley's sister city, so it wasn't too surprising that a book from there ended up minutes away in our front yard. What was surprising was the fully intact checkout card still in the sleeve on the inside. The only name and date on the card were: Roger Davis on April 3rd, 1964.



Out of curiosity, I Googled the name Roger Davis. Facebook and LinkedIn profiles popped up, all of smiling young men that were half of the age my Roger Davis would be today. I tried to narrow the search down by adding ""California,"" but no luck. I'm old enough to remember life before the internet, So I went to scavenge for The Yellow Pages book that I thought we still had somewhere.



If I had given it any real thought, I would have remembered that we got rid of our last one about five spring cleanings ago. I figured this would be the perfect time to introduce my son to the public library system. I told Cooper that we could go to the Hayward Library; since that was where the book was originally from. And we could maybe even see if they could look up any information on Roger Davis.



Although he was incredibly eager to get inside and work the case, Cooper still held the library door open for the fragile moving old man walking behind us. The librarian glared at me over the top of her thick lenses, with an ""Are you serious?"" look on her face. She sighed and lectured me on why she couldn't share the private information of their members, even if they had it. Which they didn‚Äôt. Those records were long gone. Also long gone: the Yellow Pages, apparently. I don‚Äôt know why I assumed the library would have them, but they didn‚Äôt. So, I ordered one on my phone to be delivered to my house and we left. On the way out, Cooper whispered to me that he'd be a nicer librarian for The Greenridge Road Library.



The following day was a hotter than usual spring day. My wife and I decided that a family day at the community pool sounded good. We didn't have a pool in our backyard, and no one else we knew did, either. And as a result, Cooper wasn't the best swimmer. But lucky for him, we just so happened to have come into the custody of a how-to swim book.We got to the pool and I had the highly important job of securing pool chairs for my family. It took me a little while to collect enough chairs. It would have taken longer, if not for the elderly gentleman who graciously volunteered his chair to me. His attempt at hiding from the sun under a bucket hat and sunglasses was failing, so he was leaving anyway. He was amused that I was carrying around such a vintage book. On his way out, he gave the faintest smile and said that he had the same book when he was younger.



I started thumbing through the pages to see if there were any good pointers that I could relay to Cooper, and I must not have looked hard enough the first time we found the book because I now noticed handwritten numbers on the bottom corner of every page. Two numbers on each page and they didn't correspond to the page number at all. The first page had ""37."" The next one had ""66,"" the third page had ""46,"" and so on; fifteen numbers in total. There was no obvious reason or pattern to the order, but they were neatly written and obviously intentional.



I'm not too proud to admit that my wife is smarter than I am, but I still felt like a complete idiot when it only took her a millisecond to glance at the pages and say ""Oh, neat! It's coordinates.""  Of course. Why wasn't that my first guess? Cooper asked what coordinates were and when I explained them to him, he got really excited at the thought of it being buried treasure. That excitement soured to disappointment when I shot down his proposal to go chase the coordinates that exact minute. I told him we could go the following day, and then hit the biggest cannonball he's ever seen as a distraction.



Cooper shook me until I fully woke up. He wouldn't stop until I had Google Maps open. He watched with anticipation as I typed in each number of the coordinates. The pin dropped into a cluster of trees, a little ways off of the Ward Creek walking trail in the Hayward hills. To his delight, it was only a ten-minute drive away.



Cooper was so excited walking that trail. He's not an introvert, but he rarely talks to strangers. That day, he was waving and saying hi to everyone we crossed paths with. The family walking their dog got a hey from Cooper. He said ""Have a nice day"" to the pale-haired, old man, that was catching his breath on a bench. One jogger even got a high-five from Cooper.



I couldn't help but feel like an irresponsible parent when we reached the point of the walkway that we had to diverge off of to get to the coordinates. It didn't seem like the safest trek for a ten-year-old to make, but I couldn't stomach telling him that he couldn't see this through. As we approached the coordinates, I could make out glimpses of unnatural colors in the distance. At first, I thought it was a group of people, and slid Cooper behind me as we walked up.



Standing directly on top of the coordinates, we were dead center to a group of trees. On each tree, was a t-shirt nailed to it; creating a surrounding audience. The shirts were small, like they'd fit Cooper. Six in total. Vintage, ringer style shirts with red trim and matching red font that read ""Hayward Plunge."" On the inside tags, I could make out handwritten names: John, Henry, Susie, Wayne, Donna, and Jackie.



I had no idea what Hayward Plunge meant or who these names belonged to, but that didn't really matter, I was full on panicking. My fight or flight was in high gear. This wasn't the innocent treasure hunt we thought it would be. This was wrong, very wrong. I was wrong to bring my son here. I played enough high school football to know what dried blood stains looked like on fabric.



I didn't want to let Cooper see the concern on my face, and I knew he was on the verge of asking if we could start digging for the treasure that he thought was beneath us. I needed to get him out of there as soon as possible. I tried to drum up fake enthusiasm and say we needed to celebrate us making it to the finish line. I told him we deserved ice cream for our hard work. He wasn't ready to leave until I told him he could get as many scoops and toppings as he wanted. Luckily, that was enough to get him out of there.



I thought a night of sleep would help distance me from the kid's shirts on the trees, but it didn't. It was on my mind as I got out of bed, and as I made my coffee, and was very prominently on my mind as I stood at the front room window watching my own child play in the front yard. I watched him look under rocks for bugs, and lay in the grass, and eventually check The Greenridge Road Library. Then, I watched him run into the house holding a stack of books.



He proudly laid them out on display. My stomach turned as I realized they were more vintage books. Artwork and color palettes from an era long gone. Titles like ""The Clumsy Cowboy"" and ""Hurry Up, Slowpoke."" I peeked over his shoulder as he grabbed one and skimmed through the pages. On the inside cover, read the generic ""this book belongs to:"" with Wayne scribbled under it.



For the last twenty-four hours, six names have been playing on a loop in my head. Wayne was one of them. I grabbed a different book and opened it: Susie. I didn't need to grab anymore, I already knew what I'd find. But I did anyway. One inside cover after the other; John, then Jackie, then Henry, and finally Donna.



I was ready to tear the Greenridge Road Library out of the ground at this point. I scoured through my ring notifications. Ever since we installed the library, it seemed like all of Castro Valley stops by and looks through it. I had hundreds of clips of people in front of it. It could have been any one of them. I dissected each clip to see if I could find who left the books. The problem was that the library was positioned in a way that the camera couldn't see if someone was taking or placing books. To be honest, this made me incredibly skeptical of my neighbors. Was it the dad walking his kids? The moms pushing strollers? The dog walker group? The mailman?



I gave up the hunt and set my phone on my lap as the clips continued playing. At this point, I was fully losing it. I don't know why this upset me as much as it did. It's not like someone is putting inappropriate material in the library. No one was committing crimes. It was just weird and creepy. I thought maybe it was an elaborate prank. I was willing to accept it as a prank and move on.



When I picked up my phone, it was halfway through a clip. There was no one in front of the Greenridge Road Library, or my house. So, I was confused as to why this was recorded. Then in the corner of the frame, I noticed an old man, standing across the street, and looking at the library. He remained still for an uncomfortable amount of time before turning and leaving. The video was super grainy and he was so far away that I couldn't make out any details of his face. It felt strange, though. This was enough to make me want to solve all of this, simply so I could feel like my family was safe in our home.



I tried to take inventory of all the information I had. The books, the names, the year on the library card, the coordinates, and the blood stained shirts on the trees. Shirts that had text on them. ""Hayward Plunge."" I typed the phrase into a search bar. The first suggestion was a link to the Hayward Parks and Rec website. To the right of that was a small collage consisting of a map, street view, and picture of the inside of a building.



Built in 1936, the Hayward Plunge is an indoor swimming facility. It's essentially one big pool inside of a hangar-like structure. Additionally, after seeing the map of where the plunge was located, I realized the trail that I was just on the other day, ran directly behind the building. Finally, things were starting to click.



I was waiting at the front desk as the teenager working it went off to get the manager. I felt a little foolish, but at this point, there was no way I could leave this thread loose. The manager came walking up and asked how they could help me. I took a deep breath and made the jump. I explained how I came into possession of Roger Davis's swim instruction book, how it led me to the trail, and to the displayed Hayward Plunge shirts. Which all brought me there to speak with her.



I don't know what I was expecting. It was a lot of random information to unload on an unsuspecting stranger. I for sure wasn't expecting the manager's face to drop like it did. She paused for a second, then asked ""Could we talk in my office?""



I took a seat at the desk across from her. She didn't hesitate. She said, ""Back in the day there was a small beginner swimming class that had some students who went missing."" That was chilling enough, but she continued. ""This was in the 60's, so they didn't have camera surveillance or anything like that. The Hayward P.D. didn't have any evidence of who took the kids or where the kids went."" I didn't know what to say. I didn't need to say anything, because she wasn't done. This time needing a little more strength, eventually pushing out, ""It's like, an urban legend here, so take it with a grain of salt; but people say their swim instructor went crazy and killed the kids."" I could see it in her eyes before her words came out. I knew what was coming next. She looked me dead in the eye and said, ""The instructor, his name.... was Roger.""



Everything was still spinning when I strapped my seatbelt in and it didn‚Äôt stop during the drive home. What did I invite to my home? What danger did I put my son in? Who or where was Roger Davis? That last question would be answered a lot quicker than I anticipated.



Waiting for me at our front door, was the gigantic waste of paper that is, the Yellow Pages. It made a huge thud on my kitchen table when I set it down to grab a beer. I could feel it staring at me the whole time. Begging me to open it. I knew I had to, but I really didn't want to. I was already fed up with this whole situation. It had escalated to points that I was not prepared for. I looked back at the yellow pages. It was just sitting there. I took a swig of beer and said fuck it.



I found the residents section and made my way to the names under D. It didn‚Äôt take long to put my finger over the first Davis. It was a page over and near the bottom, but there he was. Roger M. Davis. I should have left it there. Cool, I found him. Mission accomplished. I should have taken the win and moved on with my life. But I just couldn't help myself. I needed to know.



I panned to the right of his name, where his address was. I felt my beer rising in my throat as I did. Next to his name and under ""current address"" was, Green Ridge Road.



The scariest house isn't always the one that looks like it. It's not always the dilapidated house with the dead lawn and shady looking tenets who won't make eye contact with you. Sometimes it's the house that's painted in the friendliest shade of soft yellow. The one that has an American flag perfectly flying from the porch. The one with the old man that comes out like clockwork to hand water his lawn. The house that you have no problem sending your kid to their front door for candy on Halloween. What is it they say about book covers?



Roger Davis was arrested for the murders of John and Jackie Miller, ages 9 and 8. Donna Zimmerman, age 7. Wayne Jackson, age 8. Susie Lee, age 8. Henry Parker, age 6. Almost sixty years after he committed the crimes. He was 86 at the time of his arrest.



I gave the police everything I had. They used fingerprints from Henry Parker's copy of ""The Rise and Fall of Ben Gizzard,"" that was left in our library, to match with some found on belongings of his that his diligent mother kept well preserved after all these years. Roger's prints were also a match on all of the kid's books, as well as the ""How to Swim and Dive"" manual we found in our little library.



Cadaver dogs hit on the area of the coordinates and they were able to recover the remains of all the children. My stomach still fills with shame and dread because I willingly brought my son to the burial site. I let him stand feet above the bones of murdered children as we played around on a pretend scavenger hunt.



We were in the middle of dinner weeks later when I heard the sirens. Flashing lights followed, reflecting off our walls. Our street doesn't get police activity very often, if at all. I knew who they were coming for.



It took me a couple of minutes to walk down my street and get to the house surrounded by the crime scene tape. As I approached, two officers walked out a slightly hunched, white-haired man, in handcuffs. He looked frail and confused, and unremarkable from any other elderly person in the community. He wasn't someone who looked like they would be getting arrested. The policemen closed the squad door behind him, regardless.



I observed him as he sat in the backseat of the cop car. He wasn't moving at all and he was seemingly focused on the nothingness in front of him. He stayed like this for an uncomfortable amount of time.



An officer told me he couldn't share any information on the case, not knowing that I was the one who revived the six cold cases with my findings. There wasn't much more for me to see, and it felt like it was time for me to head back home.



I looked one more time at Roger. I just wanted to burn into my eyes what evil could look like, so I never put my son in danger ever again. After a few seconds, the vile old man slowly started to turn his whole body towards the window. Towards me.



His face was blank and devoid of any humanity. He pointed his vacant and dark eyes at me. I could see the faintest bit of recognition from him once he saw me. I didn't want to look away. I didn't want to give him the satisfaction of seeing fear on someone one last time. Even if I was terrified inside.



My last glimpse of him, before the car hauled him away, was the slow movement of his mouth forming the slightest, perverted, grin. He was enjoying this. He knew that he'd die soon, and he'd essentially got away with his crimes. I don't think that's what made him smile in that moment, though.



He knew that I'd see him again. Every time I watched someone leave a book in the Green Ridge Road Library for Cooper, or when Cooper's baseball coach pulls him aside to give him tips on his swing, or when I had parent-teacher conferences and met Cooper's teachers. He knew that I'd see him in every one of those people that I was trusting to be around my son.



He knew that's how he would live on.",19,1729813826.0,nosleep,2,1.0,False

We stand on the precipice of one of the most bullish crypto super cycles in history. What's more, it's a Meme cycle.

Consider this... Last cycle SHIB and DOGE flew to multi-billion-dollar market caps in an era when meme coins were nothing more than a joke. The power of the people spoke of their desire to break free from the constraints of a capitalist autocracy and find respite in an environment where they, the ordinary masses, had autonomy over their financial freedom. A light amidst the darkness compounded by centuries of big banks and financial institutions skimming from our earnings with fees at every turn, keeping every man and women down, tied deeply to mounting debt with no foreseeable way out of the dark vortex.

Today, we find ourselves at the beginning of a cycle where these very institutions that have long collaborated to keep us down, have now seen the value in us, the value in powerful community, and as such, are investing in meme coins like never before.

We are seeing blockchains themselves shifting to support and encourage meme coins because the sheer magnitude of volume on these chains can no longer be denied.

We now find ourselves in a position of power. And our power is only limited by our output, by our work ethic and our inner drive.

Kendu Inu flew from a sub 5 million market cap project to over 250M in a matter of weeks. Let that sink in for a moment because I'm about to lay down some context...

With little over 5000 holders, 100 daily workers contributing to pushing the brand across the tiny pool of money in Defi. Kendu went parabolic.

Sure, Shytoshi, the lead dev of Shiba Inu followed the account, of course, it was a new shiny toy, but it was the power of teamwork and a dev who was active every minute of the day that catapulted Kendu to glory.

Let's take stock of where we are now. Over 14400 holders, one mother of a correction and some very serious redistribution of tokens from the hands of early whales to thousands of new holders. A correction that has seen Kendu make its way back down to around 35M MC and coast along that bottom for quite some time.

This will seem simple, but this rule is very rarely followed. Do not FOMO into green candles. Buy the red. That is where the money is made. That is the smart money.

Kendu is 8 months old. Proven. A trojan horse into the real world, with energy drinks, coffee, jewellery and IRL stunts. Not to mention 15 tattoos from bullish community diehards. Make no mistake, Kendu is a cult, it is a movement, and as we move closer to this bullrun market peaking, it will have stood the test of time and will be one of the most well-known original IP projects in the world.

In a downtrend, it can sometimes be hard to see the wood for the trees, emotions run high, people are looking for someone to blame. But the truth is simple. What goes up, must come down. And for a token to reach its full potential, hit the multi billions and indeed stay there, large wallets must be diluted among new buyers.

The more important truth is that Kendu has a bottom of 30-35M. A bottom. Most projects only dream of touching those numbers at their peak. Kendu skims along that level when sentiment is at its lowest, when community output is a fraction of what it will be soon. Kendu has proven one thing, it is here to stay and it is going into the multi billions this cycle, with or without you.

For those who want to retire this cycle, the path is simple. Invest here, work for your bags, join the army. The time to free yourself from the vortex is now, when it is all quiet on the Western front, when the flurry of green candle chasers are scattered thin, throwing their bullrun capital into  perceived short term gains artificially pumped by pyramid scheme cabals who are no different than the banking systems and hedge funds you are here to escape and free yourself from. Don't fall into the same trap in defi that you loathe in the real world. These new shiny toys are exit liquidity traps, controlled by dubious minds.

And lastly ponder this, your investment decisions now are a mirror to your future. Scatter-blasting small cap rugs and unproven projects in the hope that they hit the market caps as high as the Kendu bottom is a pipe dream sold to you by those who want to take your financial freedom from you to extend their own.

The smart investments and the focus you apply today are the decisions that will either carry you through the long cold bear winter that follows this super cycle - or become the chain that binds you to the rotten system forever.

Helmets on. It is time to play smart and lay the foundation for your freedom. You are in control of the Kendu narrative, the sentiment and it's success. Lead by example and others will follow. And don't for a second let anyone dilute your passion, because after the darkest day, comes the most light. And after the greatest pain, comes the most relief. And only the true warriors can taste the sweetest victory.

All hail Kendu. The culture soaked, Shib backed, Ryoshi connected alpha you've only ever dreamt or heard of in crypto fairytales.

In one reply it output a working¬†[MEEF.py](http://meef.py/)¬†module that allowed for up to 9 players to enjoy a game of MEEF, along with basic ASCII graphics, in any mix of human and AI, along with (albeit primitive) AI behaviors, one of which pretty accurately emulated my friends playstyle.

Needless to say, I had made my point and won the debate.

However, I didn't get any sleep that night. That's not an exaggeration, I literally sat at my desk after my wife went to bed, about 11, until I woke her up with a coffee at around 8am the next morning.

I had spent the whole night working with o1 to create my own game (a single player MUDlike-roguelike-RPG).

I've gotten it to a stage now where I'm incredibly happy with the core mechanics and game loop and have been iterating incremental development of new features. The project is currently around 4,000 lines of code (between various .py modules and .json files), about 135,000 characters.

My problem is that I cant write code for toffy, I'd never even \*heard\* of Python until Monday night - that being said, I feel like I've had a crash course in python and have a reasonable understanding of how to use classes and methods and now know the difference between a def and a defunct default parameter; I can even write my own Hello World with notepad now (Its a crude ""random"" insult generator) from scratch with notepad.

But the project has grown FAR beyond my abilities to modify and edit reliably and without \*HOURS\* of debugging after making reasonably minor changes. I've set the game up to use .json files to configure as much as possible, so I can play around with mechanics and things Ive currently got implemented without breaking anything, but adding new features is becoming a nightmare.

In the early stages of development it was easy enough to copy everything to a .txt file and paste the whole project into o1 which, despite its prowess, I needed to do every now and then, either to refresh its memory or when starting a new chat.

Now though the project is too big to scrape and dump into a .txt file to share it, and development is grinding to a halt as o1 is now relying on ME to implement new code into the existing modules; I've made sure that its provided comments appropriate for dummies like me, and even got it to write an exhaustive and comprehensive guide on all the classes and how they work and interact, but Its SOOOOOOO much quicker to develop a new feature when I can ask it to output the full code snippet (with no shortcuts), and to do that reliably and in ways that work with the existing codebase I need to share the full project with it.

Is there a way to share large files with o1?

Can anyone help?

Please... Just one more feature.... that's all I need to implement... then I'll quit...

Through the course of events, he led me on, seduced me, slept with me. I am not saying I am innocent but looking back, he took advantage of my age and desire for intimacy/attention. He knew what he was doing.

Years later, I consider him a friend. One of my closest friends actually. However, I came to see the light and realize he wasn‚Äôt all that.

A mutual friend recently saw him and I told her don‚Äôt be surprised if he tries to sleep with you. And sure enough, he made the journey to see her in a strange city, because he thought she would sleep with him. However, she turned him down and while she was getting coffee, he left town.  Because end of the day he‚Äôs a coward.

But the more and more I think about it the more and more it makes me angry. It makes me angry, knowing that he would go after my friend for sex even though we haven‚Äôt talked in years.  it makes me angry, thinking back that he preyed on me and led me on. It makes me angry knowing that he has a daughter at his age of almost 60 and she is being taught this is what real men are like. 

I have his numbers. I want to tell him off. What a piece of trash he is. What he did to me. What he is doing to his kid. WIBTA to do so?  Or just let it go?",0,1729813252.0,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,2,0.5,False

(Bold is bearish on the Cocoa prices. Italics are positive. )

  
**December ICE NY cocoa (**[**CCZ24**](https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/CC*0/overview)**) Thursday closed down -245 (-3.50%), and December ICE London cocoa #7 (**[**CAZ24**](https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/CA*0/overview)**) closed down -205 (-3.81%).**

**Cocoa prices on Thursday extended their week-long selloff, with NY cocoa dropping to a 7-3/4 month nearest-futures low and London cocoa falling to a 2-week low. ¬†Harvest pressures in the Ivory Coast are undercutting cocoa prices. ¬†Monday's government data showed that Ivory Coast farmers shipped 192,804 MT of cocoa to ports from October 1 to October 20, up +12.9% from 170,794 MT shipped the same time last year. ¬†The Ivory Coast is the world's largest cocoa producer.** ¬†

**Cocoa prices are also weighed down by negative carryover from last Friday when Ivory Coast regulator Le Conseil Cafe-Cacao raised its Ivory Coast 2024/25 cocoa production estimate to 2.1 MMT to 2.2 MMT from a June forecast of 2.0 MMT.**

**Recent global cocoa demand news has been mixed. ¬†Last Thursday, the National Confectioners Association reported that North American Q3 cocoa grindings rose +12% y/y to 109,264 MT. ¬†Also, the Cocoa Association of Asia reported that Q3 Asian cocoa grinding rose +2.6% y/y to 216,998 MT. ¬†However, the European Cocoa Association reported that European Q3 cocoa grindings fell -3.3% y/y to 354,335 MT.** ¬†

*Shrinking global cocoa stockpiles are bullish for prices. ¬†ICE-monitored cocoa inventories held in US ports have been trending lower for the past 17 months and fell to a 15-year low Thursday of 1,833,436 bags.*

*Cocoa found support after Ghana's Cocoa Board (Cocobod) on August 20 cut its 2024/25 Ghana cocoa production estimate to 650,000 MT from a June forecast of 700,000 MT. ¬†Due to bad weather and crop disease, Ghana's 2023/24 coca harvest sank to a 23-year low of 425,000 MT. ¬†Ghana is the world's second-biggest cocoa producer, and its 2024/25 cocoa harvest begins in October.*

*An increase in cocoa production by Cameroon, the world's fifth-largest cocoa producer, is bearish for cocoa prices. ¬†On August 21, Cameroon's National Cocoa and Coffee Board reported that in 2023/24 (Aug/July), Cameroon cocoa production rose +1.2% y/y to 266,725. ¬†Also, Nigeria's August cocoa exports rose by +6.8% y/y to 14,984 MT. ¬†Nigeria is the world's sixth-largest cocoa producer.*

*In a bullish factor, the International Cocoa Association (ICCO) on August 30 raised its 2023/24 global cocoa deficit estimate to -462,000 MT from May's -439,000 MT, the largest deficit in over 60 years. ¬†ICCO also cut its 2023/24 cocoa production estimate to 4.330 MMT from May's 4.461 MMT. ¬†ICCO projected a 2023/24 global cocoa stocks/grindings ratio of a 46-year low of 27.4%.*

Interested companies should reach out to me by DM or email before **November 1st**!

#‚ñåMain stories covered:

>- **[NEWS]  PHINMA‚Äôs ‚Ç±1B stock rights offering gets PSE approval...** **PHINMA Corporation** [PHN 20.00 ‚ñº3.4%; 30% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=148d55480e346a55abca0fa0c5b4e4d0)] revealed it has ‚Äúsecured the necessary approvals‚Äù for a ‚Ç±1 billion stock rights offering, with an offer period running between November 13 and November 19, and a listing tentatively scheduled for November 27. Existing PHN shareholders of record as of November 8 will be allowed to purchase one offer share for every 5.56 to 6.17 PHN shares owned. PHN said that the money raised will help the company ‚Äúbetter fuel investment and expansion endeavors‚Äù. PHN‚Äôs CFO added the funds will also ‚Äústrengthen [PHN‚Äôs] balance sheet‚Äù. The proceeds of the sale will be used to ‚Äúsupport initiatives‚Äù like PHINMA Solar‚Äôs projects and Philcement‚Äôs manufacturing facility In Davao del Norte. PHN said that it would ‚Äúboost‚Äù PHNMA Properties‚Äô projects in cities like Bacolod, Cebu, Iloilo and Davao‚Äù, plus ‚Äúbolster‚Äù PHN‚Äôs ‚Äúnew ventures‚Äù like the Union Insulated Panel Corp‚Äôs facility and ‚Äúother opportunities‚Äù in ‚Äúsocialized housing, food security, healthcare, and the green industry.‚Äù PHN will set the final price of the offer on October 31.
>    - ***MB:*** It‚Äôs been a while since we‚Äôve done a stock rights offering (SRO), so let‚Äôs cover the basics really quickly. An SRO is like a follow-on offering, except that the ability to buy the offer shares is restricted to people who are already shareholders of the company, and the maximum amount of shares that you can buy is determined by the number of shares you already own. In this case, if you own ‚Ç±10,000 worth of PHN, you‚Äôd be able to buy between around 80 or 90 SRO shares (depending on the final entitlement ratio) for a price of between ‚Ç±19.42 and ‚Ç±21.55, depending on the final price. Ok, with that technical stuff out of the way, there are a few things here to note: (1) this raise doesn‚Äôt seem like it has anything to do with the investment that PHN‚Äôs subsidiary, **PHINMA Education**, took from **KKR**, since all of the potential uses for the funds seem related to various real estate and industrial projects; (2) the size of the raise seems quite modest relative to how the funds are to be used, and (3) if PHN is on your list, SROs can be a decent way to pick up additional shares at a slight discount. I‚Äôll take a closer look at this one once PHN sets the entitlement ratio and the price. You can take a look at the prospectus [here](https://www.phinma.com.ph/?wpdmdl=2693).

>- **[NEWS]  Shang Properties bought company from San Miguel for ‚Ç±2.5B...** **Shang Properties** [SHNG 3.90 ‚ñº1.5%; 27% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=faf23a81dba84f49abca0fa0c5b4e4d0)] disclosed that it purchased **Rapidshare Realty and Development Corporation** (RRDC), which is a subsidiary of **San Miguel Corporation** [SMC 86.90 ‚ñº0.1%; 37% avgVol], from SMC for ‚Äúapproximately‚Äù ‚Ç±2.5 billion. SHNG said the purchase of RRDC gives it ‚Äúownership of [RRDC‚Äôs] non-moving business and assets‚Äù, but did not elaborate on what those might be. **Bilyonaryo** referred to RRDC as an ‚Äú[inactive subsidiary](https://bilyonaryo.com/2024/10/24/robert-kuoks-shang-properties-forks-out-p2-5-billion-to-buy-ramon-angs-san-miguel-idle-property-unit/business/)‚Äù of **San Miguel Properties**.
>    - ***MB:*** As **Miguel Camus** pointed out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/miguelrcamus/status/1849258507952124251), SHNG‚Äôs disclosure doesn‚Äôt really tell investors anything about what it is buying or why. We can make an educated speculation that, as a property developer, SHNG is probably buying this company because it owns some real estate that SHNG would like to develop. The relatively high purchase price for an ‚Äúinactive subsidiary‚Äù would support that reading of the transaction. However, SHNG itself gives us nothing to work with, aside from the vaguely circular statement that owning the company will give it control of the company‚Äôs assets. Yep, that‚Äôs how it works!

>- **[AMA]  I‚Äôm Merkado Barkada, ask me anything! [PART 5]...** This is the fifth and final day of celebrating over 1 million weekly readers with an ‚ÄúAsk Me Anything‚Äù episode based on reader questions I solicited last week. Here‚Äôs the last set of answers! Congrats to all the winners!

>  **Matthew:  Can you do the expert TikTok trend? What are the three things you‚Äôd never invest in?**

>  **MB:** I‚Äôm not an expert (just an amateur with a platform), but the three things I‚Äôd never invest in are: (1) play-to-earn ‚Äútechnologies‚Äù like Axie Infinity, (2) whatever my titos pitch to me at this year‚Äôs Christmas reunion,  and (3) Apollo Global Capital. 

>  **MelchorZ:  What‚Äôs the weirdest place you‚Äôve ever written an episode of MB?**

>  **MB:** Given that I could write MB anywhere, and that I‚Äôve done it for the past five years with very few days off, you‚Äôd think that I‚Äôd have a long list of crazy locations to pull from but I really don‚Äôt. My routine is essential to the production of MB, and my physical setup is very important to that routine. I need my dual monitors, my creamy keyboard, and my Logitech MX Anywhere Bluetooth mouse. I‚Äôd say the weirdest writing location was in a grimy Airbnb after a long day of beachcombing. I‚Äôd taken an overnight trip to walk some new beaches, and I got up early to write and send out that day‚Äôs MB using just my phone. It was a very weird experience compared to my normal setup. I felt naked writing it without any of my usual toys.

>  **benbenJK:  What‚Äôs your go-to trading snack?**

>  **MB:** I‚Äôm an anxious person by nature, and I love to snack, so I‚Äôm not very picky about what I eat when I‚Äôm actively trading. The nice part for me is that my trading style doesn‚Äôt require me to actively trade that much anymore. But in the old days when I was trying to be Mr. Special Trader, I would really like to get a cup of taho from the guy on JP Rizal and sip on that while I logged in for the opening bell. Now I‚Äôm not even at my desk that much anymore when the trading day starts, and when I trade now I‚Äôm mostly fueling my anxiety with an iced coffee.

>  **karin_99:  Do you listen to music when you prepare MB? How about when you trade stocks?**

>  **MB:** I cannot listen to music when I write, especially music with lyrics, because my mind follows the music and cannot stop listening to the words and it ruins my ability to form complete sentences. I‚Äôm one of those people who cannot ignore a TV in a room, or a loud song in a bar, so when I‚Äôm writing, I like to do it in silence. Sometimes I‚Äôll put on a relaxing jazz-like YouTube stream like [Studio Ghibli Cafe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jWRrafhO7M) or a bright, uplifting stream like [Hawaiian Cafe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdiKqg23D0o), but it has to be on a speaker that is not close to me or I will fixate on it. When I‚Äôm trading, I like something with more pace, like [Aphex Twin ambient works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xw5AiRVqfqk) (back to my law school days) or a whole playlist of weird stuff that I‚Äôve never heard before from [@MyAnalogJournal](https://www.youtube.com/@MyAnalogJournal). Their episode on [Japanese Drama Funk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XASxefdL2eQ) is just chef‚Äôs kiss for executing trades (IMO). I have no idea what‚Äôs going on, but that‚Äôs crucial because it lets my brain relax from trying to understand and anticipate and just listen to the music.
 
>  **BenjiTomas:  As a lawyer you must have to wear a suit. Do you wear a tie, or are you a no-tie guy? What‚Äôs your style?**

>  **MB:** The only thing I am with absolute certainty is a ‚Äúnever vest‚Äù guy. I will never wear a three-piece suit. Most of the time, if I‚Äôm wearing a suit, I‚Äôm doing it without a tie. There are times when a tie is appropriate, and there are times when a tie is needed or even required, and in those moments I like to wear a medium-width Italian silk tie. I‚Äôm tall, so I usually need to have my ties custom altered to move the tie loop at the back of the tie to give me enough tie material to get the bottom of my tie within an inch or two of my belt. Because of that, I‚Äôm particular about my ties, even if I don‚Äôt wear them often. As for my style, I‚Äôm into more traditional looks. You‚Äôll never see me sockless, with high cuffs. I don‚Äôt tailor my suits slim. 

>  **FedericoTheBrave:  Do you have plans to hire additional writers for MB?**

>  **MB:**  Nope! I plan to write 100% of MB‚Äôs news and opinion content for the foreseeable future. That said, I am interested in bringing other voices into the content mix. I‚Äôve been experimenting with the news ‚ÄúMB Presents‚Äù feature as a way to give some other creators and their ideas some exposure. My hope is that I will be able to expand MB Presents to include write-ups from analysts on specific stocks, to give readers a glimpse into how other reasonable minds might differ in their opinions and projections based on the same public data set. As usual, though, I have more ideas than I have hours in the day haha.

1gbgkxc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalBased/comments/1gbgkxc/nausea_on_the_3rd_week/,Nausea on the 3rd week,"Hi guys!

I really need your help, I don't know what I'm doing wrong. (Female/25, with UC aka Ulcerative Colitis)

I started the carnivore diet on the 1st of October, so less then 4 weeks ago. I researched as much as I could every day. I ordered my beef liver capsules, collagen, beef broth, electrolytes and beef tallow. I ate eggs and bacon every morning, for lunch and dinner different cuts of steaks, lamb chops, chicken wings, ground beef. Salted everything and I incorporated butter wherever I could. For drinks during the day: 1-2 cups of coffee with butter, electrolytes, beef broth and of course lots of water. Also, I heard of the dangers of oxalate dumping, so I ate 1-2 pieces of 70% dark chocolate to reduce the risks. 
On the 3. week of eating and drinking like this, I started to get a little nauseous. I heard this was normal because my body was probably just adapting to the high fat diet, so I ate anyways. On the end of the 3. week I couldn't eat any of the things mentioned above, even the thought of meat made me sick. So on the 23rd in the evening I could only manage to swallow 2 tablespoons of butter. The next morning(yesterday) I already woke up with nausea. It was the worst. I cried for half an hour because I was soo soo unbelievably hungry and feeling sick at the same time and didn't know what to eat. Fasting was not an option because I was already undereating the whole week and I'm at 45 kg. So I tried to have some butter again, but no. Beef broth? No. Electrolytes? No. Then I thought to myself, before I faint, I HAVE to eat something. I tried the dark chocolate, but again, no success. Then cucumber and avocado, but I just couldn't swallow anything. The only thing I managed to get in my stomach, was bread. But thats the worst for my UC! Of course all my symptoms(bloating, pain, blood and mucus) came back in the evening. Today I still couldn't eat meat and this heavy flare up caused me to take prednisone again. 

Guys, I need to continue this diet because I felt soo good eating this way. I had no bloating, no pain, no brain fog. Also I have no other option than this diet cause my meds don't work anymore. And I can't take prednisone forever, thats also dangerous. Could someone please please help my how to get over the nauseous phase?? I just want to feel healthy again.

I did this at around 1 am, it‚Äôs now 01:24 and i just wiped my finger over my tongue and it smells just as bad as before.

First impressions:

1. Love the cute stickers; and the lovely bonuses (I had asked to pay for 2 extra containers & they were added for free along with a really adorable sticker that I put in the deli container to hold my charms); and the activator spray & instruction card (also super cute & colourful)üíúüòª

2. The Mayo condiment is my fave type of baked dessert scent - yum! And I can tell the A&W trio all have that lovely glossy thickie I‚Äôm picking as my fave texture in slimes so far. The Honey Mustard is such a clean fresh scent (hard to describe except for light clean laundry). I really like it! Finally, the Sweet n Sour looks exactly like S&S sauce! And I didn‚Äôt pay attention obviously but this one has a light sprinkling of holo glitter foil squares that is super pretty in the light!

** most jars were over packed & generous!! **

3. ü•êThe Baked DIY croissant is so realistic looking and the scent is to die for. My fave baked type gourmand! A beautiful tng that feels really clicky just from the jar (haven‚Äôt removed any yet but have poked them all lol üòÜ). The creamy drizzle feels really soft and buttery too. 

4. The Maple French Toast is so fun and detailed too! It smells heavenly! That‚Äôs going to be so satisfying to put together! The maple syrup clear looks just like syrup! And the DIYs are both fresh & soft. Lol looks like you want to eat them ü§£. The base is my fave tng type as well. The Amber maple leaf charm is high quality and looks exactly like a maple syrup candy that I see around Canada shops. Love it!üßá

5. The faux Tim Hortons cafe one smells delicious!! And the texture is a looser glossy. I bet this was a dream to scoop! I love the feel of this - will be a top fave as it‚Äôs so smooth & buttery. The colour is just like my fave double double coffee! The 2 ice cube charms are really high quality and will be fun to put on top once assembled. 

6. The jars and labels are great quality. I really love how they look with Tanooki‚Äôs sweet little furry animals on them! I love animals so this is just ‚Äúextra‚Äù fun & cute for me. Esthetics to me are the best as I‚Äôm very visual & love vibrant colours and cute creations üíú‚ú®

7. Last but certainly not least - the Mystery Slime! It says ‚ÄúPure‚Äù and is so fruity citrusy and fresh. Like grapefruits - ripe & sweet. Can I say how Thrilled I am with what they chose for me!! I wanted to try a Jelly soon and boom this is it! So beautifully glossy and a bit wet/cold (in the best way - not really wet but feels like it on your finger tips poking it down). I just LOVE the colour too! It reminds me of my fave yellow peach roses when they blend in full bloom. üçë I love a good buttery peachy colour that is bright and summery. This is Perfect for me! It came with these really cute fimos (I think that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre called) - iridescent leaves (or stars lol I need to look again) and tiny grapefruit slices!!)ü•≠üçä

The small cape town had tales of with sea creatures lurking in the shadows, but it was definitely the sleep center they'd vote on.  Anne had been having sleep issues.

‚ÄúDo you feel it?‚Äù Anne's voice was a soft rasp, crackling with excitement.  ‚ÄúSomething's off here, Ian.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou're just tired, hun,‚Äù Ian said, trying to sound reassuring. They had spent the last few nights in rundown motels with thin walls and stale coffee. It was exhausting work. Searching for the antiquated supernatural in places that had long forgotten the creature.

Anne sank deeper into the chair, her eyes fluttering shut. ‚ÄúI want to see the truth, Ian. The creatures, the connections‚Ä¶ all of it.‚Äù

The hypnotherapist arrived, a middle-aged woman with a calm demeanor. She looked at Ian and Anne with keen eyes. ‚ÄúIs she ready?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, let‚Äôs do this.‚Äù He fought to suppress his rising concerns.

As the woman guided Anne under, Ian kept watching, waiting. After a few moments, Anne whispered, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something out there‚Ä¶ lurking.‚Äù

The air thickened. Ian‚Äôs heart raced. He leaned closer. ‚ÄúWhat do you see, Anne?‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt‚Ä¶ it's like I‚Äôm there, but not.‚Äù Her voice wavered. ‚ÄúI see darkness and‚Ä¶ sorrow, Ian.‚Äù

He frowned slightly. This wasn't what he expected. ‚ÄúCan you focus? Describe it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying!‚Äù she snapped back, her voice rising. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs creeping around us, growing heavy. Like it knows‚Ä¶ it knows I‚Äôm afraid.‚Äù

A pit formed in Ian‚Äôs stomach. Fear wasn‚Äôt just a word. He understood its weight. Anne's love for horror movies had always made her unafraid, but now her vulnerability was raw and evident.

‚ÄúJust breathe,‚Äù the hypnotherapist suggested, her voice low and reassuring.

Suddenly, Anne gasped. ‚ÄúIan! It sees me! Something is‚Ä¶ crawling inside.‚Äù Her body jolted in the chair; her eyes opened wide.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean? What‚Äôs happening?‚Äù

Panic surged all around the room and up and down the hallways of the center. Anne was losing control, twitching on the gurney in seizures, her mouth frothing and a puddle forming under where she fell.

‚ÄúIan! Help me!‚Äù she screamed, thrashing against the restraints that held her in place.

‚ÄúStop! I need you to focus!‚Äù Ian shouted, wrestling with his own fears. It wasn‚Äôt just Anne's nightmare anymore. It felt all too real.

The therapist's calm fa√ßade began to crack. ‚ÄúStay calm, Anne. You‚Äôre safe. You've just bumped into an unpleasant memory.‚Äù

*Does safety even exist when a person's memories come that far up to the surface?*

Ian realized he was helpless to stop the takeover.

*Food for thought:  You dont even understand what is going on, you're trying but*

‚ÄúI'm going to go get some Cheetos, Im kinda tired of this shit Anna,‚Äù Ian exclaimed, eyes darting for the door.

Anne's voice came through again, trembling wit fear. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre coming‚Ä¶ they can smell your sorrow, Ian‚Ä¶‚Äù

The lights flickered again. Ian let the door slam.  He was glad he didn't hear her anymore.

*Why is that? Why is it that you now suddenly feel sorry for Anne?*

The therapist‚Äôs demeanor changed as Ian walked. ‚ÄúYou need to let go, Anne. Stop fighting.‚Äù

Ian's mind raced. Was it all a manipulation? A trap crafted to entice him down her rabbit hole?

Anne‚Äôs screamed out so loudly that her words went down three hallway corridors to the ear's of Ian. ‚ÄúI see it‚Ä¶ the truth‚Ä¶ you wanted too much Ian‚Ä¶‚Äù

In that moment, realization hit. Ian had been manipulated.  Anne was going to use her time here to try to manipulate Ian into feeling guilty and getting the sympathy of the whole sleep clinic on her side.

Ian stepped out to smoke.  Kicking the ash as it fell on the ground, wishing it was Anne's face.  His boot rubbed it into the wet rain on the sidewalk.

The twisted irony of their pursuits. Their quest for the unexplained. The thirst for something bigger than themselves.

*And in the end, I the one and only Mop gave you no heroes.  Both these characters are crappy people endlessly manipulating each other.  You'd never sort which one is night and day.*

*And then, clarity emerged.*

*It was all a lie.*

*You never had a reliable narrator in Mop the whole time.*

*When you can't breathe Mop will breath for you.  Mop is a fairy that will come in your dreams and let you accept the monster inside you.  Put the pieces back together my way. That's all I ever wanted.  Mop feeds on hate.  Unleash it, please.*",1,1729811915.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

1gbg5fd,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gbg5fd/reconnecting_with_my_highschool_best_friend_and/,Reconnecting with my highschool best friend (and saviour) ‚Äî But Now I Have Feelings,"Hey Reddit,

I‚Äôm really nervous about posting this, but I could really use some advice about reconnecting with someone who was a big part of my life in high school. I‚Äôm \[30M\], and recently I heard some news that brought up a lot of old emotions and memories. Here‚Äôs the story:

Back in high school, I used to get bullied a lot because I was super skinny and had really bad acne. One day, this older guy from the year above me‚Äîlet‚Äôs call him ‚ÄúJ‚Äù‚Äîapproached me. He asked if I still had his BB gun that he had lent to me a while back. At the time, I was terrified because I thought he was going to use it as an excuse to bully me too. But it turned out to be the complete opposite.

From that day on, J kind of became my protector. After that moment, the bullying stopped, and we became really close. He was like a big brother to me. Two years before we graduated, though, tragedy struck. His mom passed away, and his family had to move across the country. I didn‚Äôt get to say goodbye properly, and we lost touch.

Fast forward to today. I recently got out of an abusive relationship, and after a long time of healing, I feel ready to start dating again. A mutual high school friend told me that J is going to be moving back to town for a few months to do some guest lectures at a local university. I was shocked because we hadn‚Äôt talked in years. But what really caught my attention was that after moving to his new state, J came out as bisexual, something I had no idea about back in school.

I‚Äôm bisexual too, and hearing that gave me this fluttery, excited feeling. Seeing him again after all this time, especially after everything we‚Äôve both been through, feels like fate or something. He‚Äôs been really successful‚Äîboth financially and in his relationships‚Äîbut strangely enough, he‚Äôs still single.

A few days ago, he actually reached out to me on social media, asking if I wanted to grab coffee since he‚Äôll be back in town and doesn‚Äôt know many people here anymore. The idea of meeting up has me feeling all kinds of emotions. He was such an important part of my life back then, and now I‚Äôm wondering if this could be something more than just a reunion. But at the same time, I don‚Äôt want to scare him off or make things weird, especially since we haven‚Äôt spoken in so long.

What should I do? How do I reconnect with him without coming on too strong? Should I bring up the fact that we‚Äôre both bi, or would that be weird? I‚Äôm really torn between wanting to explore if there could be something more between us and not wanting to jeopardize a potential friendship.

Any advice on how to approach this would mean the world to me. Thanks for reading.

  
**TL;DR**: I used to get bullied in high school until an older student became my protector. After he moved away due to family tragedy, we lost touch. Now, years later, he‚Äôs coming back to town, and I‚Äôm excited but nervous about reconnecting. He reached out to grab coffee, and I‚Äôm looking for advice on how to approach this meeting, considering our past and potential feelings.",1,1729811526.0,relationships,0,1.0,False
1gbg4x2,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1gbg4x2/nausea_on_the_3rd_week/,Nausea on the 3rd week,"Hi guys!

I really need your help, I don't know what I'm doing wrong. (Female/25, with UC aka Ulcerative Colitis)

I started the carnivore diet on the 1st of October, so less then 4 weeks ago. I researched as much as I could every day. I ordered my beef liver capsules, collagen, beef broth, electrolytes and beef tallow. I ate eggs and bacon every morning, for lunch and dinner different cuts of steaks, lamb chops, chicken wings, ground beef. Salted everything and I incorporated butter wherever I could. For drinks during the day: 1-2 cups of coffee with butter, electrolytes, beef broth and of course lots of water. Also, I heard of the dangers of oxalate dumping, so I ate 1-2 pieces of 70% dark chocolate to reduce the risks. 
On the 3. week of eating and drinking like this, I started to get a little nauseous. I heard this was normal because my body was probably just adapting to the high fat diet, so I ate anyways. On the end of the 3. week I couldn't eat any of the things mentioned above, even the thought of meat made me sick. So on the 23rd in the evening I could only manage to swallow 2 tablespoons of butter. The next morning(yesterday) I already woke up with nausea. It was the worst. I cried for half an hour because I was soo soo unbelievably hungry and feeling sick at the same time and didn't know what to eat. Fasting was not an option because I was already undereating the whole week and I'm at 45 kg. So I tried to have some butter again, but no. Beef broth? No. Electrolytes? No. Then I thought to myself, before I faint, I HAVE to eat something. I tried the dark chocolate, but again, no success. Then cucumber and avocado, but I just couldn't swallow anything. The only thing I managed to get in my stomach, was bread. But thats the worst for my UC! Of course all my symptoms(bloating, pain, blood and mucus) came back in the evening. Today I still couldn't eat meat and this heavy flare up caused me to take prednisone again. 

Guys, I need to continue this diet because I felt soo good eating this way. I had no bloating, no pain, no brain fog. Also I have no other option than this diet cause my meds don't work anymore. And I can't take prednisone forever, thats also dangerous. Could someone please please help my how to get over the nauseous phase?? I just want to feel healthy again.

Tinha uma placa na parede: ""estamos h√° 4 dias sem sermos destratados por clientes""...

Preferi um caf√© que n√£o estava nos garraf√µes.
Preparo na Aeropress na minha mesa. Sorvete (esse tava bom).

N√£o voltaria (talvez s√≥ pelo sorvete).

What would you do? I‚Äôm 22M She‚Äôs 25F,"I have been dating this girl long distance for a little over a year now. A month ago, I bought her a plane ticket so she could visit me and her cousin, who lives in my area. Since we‚Äôre long-distance, most of our communication is via text or phone calls. We text frequently throughout the day, and because I get off work before she does, she calls me every day after she gets off.

Last Saturday, she went to a party with her friend, and ever since then, our communication has dwindled. I‚Äôve always told her that if she‚Äôs going out with friends or doing something, she doesn‚Äôt need to text me, as I trust her and would much rather she enjoy herself. Despite this, she would normally find time to talk to me after whatever she was doing, but that Saturday, we only talked a couple of times. This trend continued until today. We hardly talk anymore, and she doesn‚Äôt call me, except for Monday when she called to tell me she got a new job. I congratulated her and even bought her a perfume she‚Äôd wanted for a long time as a gift.

Today, I couldn‚Äôt hold my tongue anymore and finally asked her if everything was alright. She told me that she had something to tell me, but she wanted me to promise I wouldn‚Äôt be petty and cancel her flight. She said she wanted to tell me in person, but she did meet somebody new at the party and was interested in pursuing things with him.

I feel hurt, confused, and blindsided because I honestly trusted her 100% and never thought that would be the reason she was being distant. I told her I wouldn‚Äôt cancel her flight and that we could still grab a coffee or something, but I‚Äôm hurt. I‚Äôm hurt that she wanted to make sure I wouldn‚Äôt cancel her flight before telling me, and hurt that she let me buy her a gift knowing she was going to end things with me. We‚Äôve already met in person before so I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs had anything to do with it.

She‚Äôs always been great to me despite this, and I don‚Äôt want to end things on a bad note, but I do feel like I‚Äôve been used and played for a fool. I‚Äôve never dated long distance or been in any kind of relationship this long, so I‚Äôm just looking advice.

TLDR: I bought a plane ticket for a girl I‚Äôm dating long distance to visit me. She‚Äôs been distant after attending a party a week ago. After finally asking why she reveals that she met someone new at the party, but wasn‚Äôt going to tell me until we met in person, as she didn‚Äôt want me to cancel her flight. 

Edit: Another piece of context is that while we were exclusive with each other, we both did say that if the time ever came where we met someone new, we would tell each other. She‚Äôs never been a bad person and I have nothing negative to say about her, it‚Äôs just the fact that she was going to wait to tell me after I already booked her flight, and was going to take her out that doesn‚Äôt sit right with me.",1,1729811262.0,relationship_advice,45,0.6,False

I‚Äôd end up wired but exhausted, stuck in a awful cycle.

I knew I needed to try something, so I started tweaking my routine based on stuff I learned from Andrew Huberman and Matt Walker. Turns out, it wasn‚Äôt about just drinking less caffeine like everyone recommends‚Äî just using it better.

Now, I don‚Äôt drink coffee the second I wake up. I hydrate first (pinch of salt or electrolyte packet) and wait 60-90 minutes to let my body clear out adenosine (the sleepy chemical).

I also microdose caffeine‚Äî15-30 mg every few hours keeps me focused without the highs and crashes. But the most important in my opinion? Cutting off all caffeine by 2 PM. That one change alone made my sleeping way better.

The difference has been unreal. My sleep is back on track, my focus is steady all day, and I don‚Äôt even miss the afternoon coffee hit. If I feel a slump creeping in, I‚Äôll go for a walk or do some NSDR (non-sleep deep rest).

I have two washed Ethiopian coffees currently (from my Luna Coffee subscription), and with the old grinder I was getting way too much astringency and having trouble dialing them in. With the new grinder, the coffee is sweet, tasty, and full-bodied. Hooray! I've been brewing pourovers for several years, but I've just recently started really diving down the rabbit hole. Now I finally feel like I have the tools to really develop my technique and feel confident that it's my technique and recipe choices driving the results.

The only issue is that I'm not tasting as much of the bright origin characteristics as I was getting before - it mostly just tastes like generic good coffee. I want to bring out more acidity and some of those unique fruity and floral notes, ideally without losing the sweetness. 

My approach this morning, for both coffees, was as follows - basically Lance Hedrick's universal V60 recipe. I used 15g for one and 24g for the other, but the recipe was otherwise the same. 

- V60
- 1:17 ratio 
- 95¬∞C water
- Coffee ground at setting 6.5 on the K Ultra (with zero at burr lock)
- 3x coffee weight bloom for 2 minutes
- Single pour to final weight, slow flow with small circles and pour height just below breakup
- Swirls after both the bloom and main pours

I'm assuming what I want to do is increase extraction? In which case my main ideas are as follows: 
- increase temperature
- lower grind size
- increase agitation (probably by adding more pours)
- increase ratio 

I will happily do some trial and error to see what works, but I figured I'd ask here first to make sure I'm on the right track or if there's something else I should be looking at.

I also have a Switch (which is also pretty new to me) and would welcome any suggestions for using that to get what I'm looking for, but I do want to learn how to dial in my V60 brews regardless.",2,1729810331.0,pourover,6,1.0,False
