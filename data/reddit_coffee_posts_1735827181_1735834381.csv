1hrx6fm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hrx6fm,Any info or tips for me please?,"Female,30,Ireland here!!

Hey everyone. Any encouragement or tips or info would be great help cause Ive lost all hope and will power.

I’ve been suffering with major lower back and leg pain on my right side since December 2021 . I’ve been out of work the past 3 years. My life has plummeted to near rock bottom I would say. I don’t know who I am anymore and I basically feel like I’m in survival mode. Surviving to just exist , haven’t lived life at all.  I’ve moved back home with my parents and all due to it. 

I can barely sit, stand or walk for 5 mins. I’ve had every symptom imaginable bar numbness in my groin or bum and haven’t had major
Incompetence issues. Major lower back spasms, numbness, tingling , electric shock like pain going the entire way down my legs to my toes, drop foot like I’m dragging yet limping when I’m walking the lot. The calf pain I feel is absolutely debilitating.  

I’m like a jack in the box when I try relax sitting because of the pain.  Initially when the pain kicked in 3 years ago, I was referred for back care clinic for physical therapy through the hospital and was referred to orthopaedics. Obviously there was a wait list so for the first 6 months of having the pain I was recommended going to massage / physical therapy, accupuncture and just to try keep moving as much as I could.  I tried all of the above and there was no help. I eventually after a year got into the back care clinic and was seeing the physio every 4/6 weeks from November’22 to February’24 as he felt he couldn’t help me much but wanted to keep me in the system somehow as he knew I needed help. He told me pain injections were definitely the next step so I was waiting almost two years for my pain injection.     So a month ago on the 6/12 I had an updated mri scan as it had been two years since my first one and I personally kept asking to be referred for another . I wouldn’t find laying on my back the most comfortable due to the back pain so during my MRI laying there for 15 minutes I could feel my lower back tensing… woke up the following morning and knew the pain was after ramping up… attempted to take it slow but also knew I only had that weekend for my Christmas shopping as I was due in hospital the 14th for my injection and wanted to rest after that before Christmas.      Sunday the 8th of December I could barely move in pain, spent the entire day in bed , needed assistance from family getting out of bed , help getting to the toilet, help to sit and go to the toilet and wiping after I couldn’t do anything. Laid in bed on my stomach the entire day and any slight movement I could need up screaming the pain felt that bad.   My parents ended up calling an ambulance Sunday night and went to A&E … morphine and the green whistles helped so much but they told me it was just a bad flare up of the symptoms I had and sent be home the next day with solpacodine and diclac and crutches. I still wasn’t right, I hadn’t eaten in 3 days from pain and spend the Monday in bed again. Still needing boyfriend and parents to wipe after the toilet. I’d barely slept all weekend. Monday night around 3am I woke myself up screamingggg in pain, yet again my parents called A&E again .    Morphine and more green whistles, oxynorm were giving to be and I got great doctor who properly examined me this time  , fingers up the backside to check my muscles the lot. Got the orthopaedic doctor down to me and all.  To cut it short, because I was due my pain injection that week there wasn’t much could be done . He gave me a prescription for  - Baclofen, Pregabalin , Paracetamol and Oxynorm for 5-7 days.   They helped me majorly and I’d finally seen the rest of the house outside of my bedroom in 4 days and could semi shuffle to the toilet but still needed assistance .    My mam got a walker with a seat and a shower stool for me that had belonged to my grandad before he passed . 

Saturday 14th I finally got my injection, it felt like the most emotional relief finally getting the thing I’d been waiting practically The past 3 years for.  Nerve blocker in my lower back and honestly the relief I felt the day I got it compared to the pain I was in the past week was amazing. 

Since then I’ve taken it so slow, I’m still using my crutches and the walker daily absolute life savers as I can’t even stand to cook, make coffee , wash face or anything. 

I was told 2/3 weeks before I feel the benefit of the injection and I honestly am still in so much pain. My calf pain is causing me so much discomfort even when I’m resting or trying to go asleep even laying on my stomach is discomforting that I’m not sleeping 

I’ve an appointment with my doctor next week as I haven’t seen her since my injection but it’ll be another appointment where I go in roaring crying because I feel so trapped and lost and don’t know what else to do.   

Mentally I’m drained, the constant effort and hyping up to do anything because of the pain is getting to me, pushing myself to move slowly or at all has me drained. I haven’t done a thing the past month, bar shuffle around the house in agony, “helped out” with some chores sitting down on the walker . I haven’t gone outside the house because sitting in the car is even discomforting. 

I’ve attached the two reports from mri scan … the first one from May 2022 and the other from December 2024 which are dated on them. 


To add insult to injury , I’m applied for disability benefit November 2023 and was eventually declines as the “pain isn’t bad enough”. I appealed it in June and it’s still only showing as submitted. 

Anyone been  in the same boat?

good chilled iced coffees to now just can’t stop using my switch have made choice to move away from sugary coffee to black pour overs now.

But one thing remains the same that is dipping at least 2-3 good day biscuits and having it like they really taste soo good.

With milk coffee the dark flavour feels so good and with pour overs having good new flavour evolve like all the taste mentioned i can feel with these biscuits that with many coffee feel like addicting.

Also if people say i like sugar filled coffee would say i have tiered to add sugar into my pour overs and would say never try that it ruins the coffee.",1,1735834075.0,IndiaCoffee,1,1.0,False

I'm looking for someone to play coop games with (we were here, it takes two, ...) or any other kind of multiplayer games. I find that it's a great way to break the ice and get to know each other slowly while playing together. For now I'm mostly looking for friendship but I'm not opposed for it to develop into something more if the feelings are there (and if we're able to work together in a coop game, there's a good chance we might make a relationship work, no ?). It would be best if you live in Europe in order to avoid struggling with time zones. I'm open to meet and have a drink/meal together if we live close to each other. I'm also looking to travel to another country sometimes next year so if you live in an interesting place to visit that might be a good occasion to meet in the future.

Here's some info about me :

I'm 29, I live in France near Paris. I work as a software developer. Appearance side, I have brown eyes and hair.

I like videos games, mostly RPG and indie games but also coop games and multiplayer ones (what a surprise, right ?). I like reading and tabletop RPG.

I'm practicing martial arts and running with my colleagues (I'm participating to some running events throughout the year to motivate myself to continue).

I tend to be more of a homebody as I like to stay at home chilling especially during winter where I can be comfy watching TV with a plaid and some coffee. But I also like from time to time to move outside to see a friend or all other kind of occasion.

I really like animals, even though I don't have any at the moment so feel free to send me a pic of your pet if you have any.

If you're interested, feel free to send me a message. Please include a bit about yourself.",1,1735834045.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

1hrx111,https://v.redd.it/8xxx8kv2tlae1,New 12cm 1500watt Moka/Tea/Sauce stove,"I found this unusually powerfull ministove on AliExpress and a cupon code made me pull the trigger. 

It completely boiled half a liter of cold water in a cold Demeyere saucepan in less than 5 minutes. 

It did so while also heating extremely evenly, very much unlike my tiny 800w portable induction stove which took allmost 9 minutes to boil the water in the same water test. 

When heating an undersized iron teapot it thermal throttes somewhat, but does not use on/off regulation when throttling or used at s low power mode. It just continuesly glows dimmer. 

The purple lighting is the camara picking up invisible infarred lighting, in real life tve stove just glows very much red.

I have only played around with it about an hour, but I like it very much so far. 

Its about 186mm x 186mm and it has some surprisingly heft and sturdiness too it. 

It seems to be overall very well built as it bearly gets get hot at all on the underside. 

It is much less noise as the multiple portable induction stoves I have heard, as the noise is exaggerated in the video due to the phone only being around 20cm away from the stove when filming. 

So far I would highly recommend it as a portable small burner or moka coffee, tea or saucepan/saucier heater.

Selling off my game collection.  I have everything listed out by console. I am open to a full buy out, I have buyout numbers for each console below - Every single price is OBO, so please make offers if you're interested. Worst case scenario is I say no. Pricing does not intrinsically cover shipping, however if you pick up over 50$ worth of stuff I generally either split or take over the shipping cost.

With the bigger stuff, CE's etc. we can figure out the shipping cost and work out a deal there. Especially for the Death Stranding CE. That bear is going to be...interesting to ship.

Thank you so much for your time.

1hrwy3j,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hrwy3j/something_is_lurking_in_my_for_you_page/,Something is lurking in my For You Page,"New Year’s Eve has always been my favorite holiday. There’s something magical about counting down the seconds to a fresh start while the world seems to hold its breath. This year, I spent it with my friends at Brianna’s apartment—a cozy, dim space strung with fairy lights and half-empty glasses of champagne. We alternated between shouting song lyrics and scrolling through Blinksy, basically with our phones stuck to our hands.

I’m not just a casual Blinksyer—I’ve got a following. A decent one. People like my quick cuts, trendy dances, and my knack for jumping on viral sounds before they blow up. My friends roll their eyes whenever I whip out my phone to film, but it’s all part of the routine. As the countdown to midnight began, I filmed everything. Brianna was popping confetti cannons. Trevor was horribly failing at his attempts at spraying champagne. And we screamed into the new year like lunatics. My followers ate it up.

“Last one of the night,” I said, holding my phone at arm’s length to capture the perfect angle.

Behind me, the room buzzed with laughter and music. The Blinksy algorithm worked its magic, and within minutes, my notifications were blowing up with likes and comments. The rush I got was a mixture of validation and pride. But as the clock struck twelve and the fireworks outside faded, something changed.

“Check your comments!” Brianna called from across the room, her face illuminated by her phone. I assumed it was another joke about my FYP obsession.

I scrolled through the flood of comments, most of them the usual—fire emojis, “queen,” “mood”—but scattered between them were stranger ones.

“Who’s that behind you?”

“Creepy A F.”

“Is this a prank, or…?”

Confused, I replayed the video. The camera panned across my friends, where their faces glowed under the string lights, then settled on me. At first, it seemed normal. But in the corner of the frame, near the hallway leading to Brianna’s bedroom, there was something—someone? A shadowy figure, blurry and indistinct, almost like a glitch in the video.

“Did you see that?” I asked as I showed Brianna and Trevor. They squinted at the screen and laughed.

“It’s probably just compression or whatever,” Trevor said. “Doesn’t Blinksy mess with quality sometimes?”

Brianna nodded—but looked uneasy—and said, “Yeah, maybe it’s a smudge on the lens or something.”

I tried to shake it off, but the more I stared, the less it looked like a glitch. The outline of the figure seemed… deliberate.

A chill ran down my spine, but I laughed it off and said, “Guess the algorithm loves a little mystery.”

But as the night wore on and my notifications continued to blow up, the comments got weirder.

“It’s moving closer.”

“I just rewatched—what the hell is that?”

“Don’t look behind you.”

After that and reading those disturbing yet very real comments, I didn’t sleep that night.

New Year’s Day arrived with an unease I couldn’t shake. The sunlight filtering through my bedroom blinds would’ve felt warm and promising, but felt cold. Sterile. Maybe it was the hangover—or maybe it was the Blinksy comments that haunted me through the night. I rolled over and grabbed my phone, sluggish but eager to confirm if what I saw the night before was real.

The first video on my feed wasn’t mine. It was a grainy, low-quality clip of an empty house. Its windows were boarded up, and the door hung halfway off its hinges. The audio crackled with a faint, distorted hum, almost like a voice trying to speak through static. Beneath it, the caption read #foryounightmare.

I scrolled past it, trying to ignore the growing pit in my stomach, and opened my own profile. The New Year’s Eve post was still blowing up, at over 30,000 views. The comments section, though, was disturbing.

“Does anyone else see it getting closer in every upload?” someone asked.

“Girl, take this down. This is bad energy,” said another.

The last comment I hastily glanced over said, “This isn’t a joke. Stop filming.”

I hesitated before pressing play on the video again. At first glance, it seemed the same as from the night before, the blurry figure still hovering in the background. But when I replayed it for the third time, my heart stopped. The figure wasn’t just standing in the hallway. It had moved. Slightly, just enough to snag my focus. Its outline was sharper, and the features of its face were barely discernible.

My phone buzzed in my hand, causing me to flinch. A DM notification. The sender’s username was just a bunch of random letters and numbers, and the message hit me like ice water.

“You’re famous to me. I’m closer than you think.”

The screenshot attached had my heart racing. It was a photo of my bedroom window, taken from outside. I flew out of bed and pulled the curtains closed with trembling hands. Panting and gasping, I turned back to my phone, trying to find an explanation. Someone was messing with me. It had to have been a prank. But who? Brianna? Trevor? They weren’t the type to go this far.

Panicking, I called Brianna, hoping she’d pick up.

“Hey, did you send me a weird message just now?” I tried to sound calm, but my voice cracked halfway through.

“What? No,” she said, her tone groggy. “Why would I—what’s going on?”

I hesitated, feeling foolish for even asking. “Nothing. Never mind.” I hung up before she could press further.

For the entire day, I couldn’t stop refreshing my feed. More #foryounightmare videos popped up. Each creepier than the last. They all had the same eerie atmosphere, flickering lights, distant footsteps, faint, layered, whispers.

That night, as I lay in bed scrolling, the notifications started again. My followers were tagging me in videos I didn’t recognize. They showed me sitting in my room, staring blankly at my phone. But I hadn’t filmed them. At least, I didn’t think I had.

The next morning, I woke up to a fresh wave of dread. My phone buzzed incessantly, lighting up with notifications from Blinksy. As I rubbed the sleep from my eyes, I realized it wasn’t normal engagement. These were tags. Dozens of them.

When I opened the app, my stomach twisted. People had stitched my New Year’s Eve post, adding their own terrified commentary. Some zoomed in on the blurry figure in the background, pointing out how it appeared clearer than before. Others uploaded clips of their own Blinksys, altered to include the same shadowy figure.

One user’s video hit me the hardest. It was a split-screen: my video on top and theirs on the bottom. In mine, the figure loomed faintly in the background. In theirs, it was standing at the edge of their bed, completely still. Its outline was jagged, like static carved into human form.

My hands shook as I scrolled through the comments. They were all the same.

One said, “What is this thing?!”

“It showed up in my video, too!” someone else claimed.

Someone even went as far to blame me by saying, “River, stop posting. You’re making it worse.”

I threw my phone onto the bed and paced the room. This wasn’t real. It couldn’t be. Maybe someone hacked my account, edited the videos, and tricked other people into doing the same. But the fear in their voices… it wasn’t staged.

I snatched my phone, deciding to confront it head-on. My notifications had piled up even more, but one stood out—a video sent directly to me. The username was hidden, replaced by a simple, chilling label: Anonymous.

The video was a low-angle shot of my house. My stomach dropped when I recognized the glowing string lights in my bedroom window. The camera zoomed in slowly, shakily, until it rested on me. I was sitting at my desk, scrolling. The timestamp in the corner read 12:23 a.m.—the night before.

I never felt watched. I never heard anything. My skin crawled as I rewound the video, hoping I’d somehow misinterpreted it. But no. It was me, completely oblivious.

The captions below the video made my blood run cold.

“We’re closer now. This is just the beginning.”

Tears stung my eyes as I slammed my phone onto my desk. I felt cornered, trapped by something I couldn’t see. But I couldn’t just ignore it—not when it was clearly spreading to other people. My FYP spiraled deeper into chaos, showing videos tagged #foryounightmare. Each post felt like a glimpse into hell. Distorted faces, abandoned streets, and faint whispers layered beneath the audio tracks.

One Blinksy stood out from the rest. It was my video, the New Year’s Eve post—but it had been edited. The figure was no longer blurry. It had moved closer to the camera, revealing a face—or what should’ve been a face. Instead, there was nothing but a blank, rippling void where features should have been.

But that wasn’t the worst part. The figure wasn’t in my living room anymore. In the edited clip, it was standing outside my bedroom window.

Right where I was.

By the time night fell, Blinksy wasn’t just a social media app anymore—it was a full-blown horror show. My FYP had morphed into something unrecognizable. Every scroll felt like diving deeper into a void. Some tags were new clips from terrified users claiming to see the same figure. Others were stitched versions of my own posts, all distorted in ways that made my skin crawl.

The figure was no longer just a blurry anomaly in the background. In every repost, it moved closer, inching toward the camera with each new edit. Its movements were subtle—almost imperceptible—but deliberate. The thing wasn’t just there. It was aware.

What chilled me most was how far the #foryounightmare trend had spread. Strangers on Blinksy were sharing videos of their experiences, claiming they’d seen the figure in their own homes. Some thought it was a brilliant prank or an elaborate ARG. Others weren’t so sure.

My heart sank as I stumbled upon a viral clip from a girl named Cassie. She sat cross-legged on her bed, tears streaming down her face as she spoke into the camera.

“I don’t know what’s happening,” she stammered. “It was in my mirror last night. I—I swear, it’s not just a glitch. I don’t feel safe anymore.”

The video cut to a stitched clip. It was an overhead shot of Cassie, asleep in her bed. The figure stood at her bedside, unmoving, watching her. The person who stitched it captioned the video: “It’s closer for her now.”

I slammed my phone onto the nightstand, too nauseous to keep watching. Every nerve in my body screamed at me to shut the app down for good, but curiosity—no, obsession—had its claws in me. I needed answers. I needed this to stop.

A notification buzzed, dragging me back to the screen. It was another anonymous video. My stomach dropped as I opened it.

This one was taken inside my house. It started in my kitchen, the angle low and shaky, as if filmed by someone crouching. The camera moved slowly through the hallways, then stopped at my bedroom door. The handle jiggled, and the door creaked open. My breath hitched as the video ended, frozen on a single frame: me, lying in bed, sound asleep.

My throat closed up. It wasn’t possible. My house was locked. I had been alone all night. How?

A sharp knock at the window made me jump, my heart slamming into my ribs. I froze, paralyzed by a wave of terror that I couldn’t shake. Slowly, I turned to face the window.

At first, I saw nothing—just my dim reflection in the glass. Then it shifted. Behind me, in the reflection, something moved. A shadow. It was standing there, impossibly tall, just a few feet away.

I spun around, but the room was empty. My chest tightened, and I couldn’t breathe. When I turned back to the window, my reflection smiled at me—but I wasn’t smiling.

I screamed, hurling the phone across the room. It hit the wall with a sickening thud, but the screen stayed on, flickering like a heartbeat.

Another notification chimed.

“Would you like to post a duet?”

I barely slept that night, and when I did, the nightmares were relentless. Dark hallways stretched endlessly, filled with distorted laughter and flickering glimpses of that figure—always just out of reach but impossibly close. I woke drenched in sweat, my phone buzzing incessantly on the nightstand. Every notification was the same: another repost, another mention of the #foryounightmare.

I couldn’t ignore it anymore. Something about this was far worse than a viral trend or even some deranged prank. It felt deliberate, targeted, and worst of all, personal.

I started scrolling through the #foryounightmare tag. The sheer volume of videos was staggering. Clips showed the figure in alleys, mirrors, darkened rooms—always watching, always closer than before. Some users claimed it had started following them after they engaged with the tag. Others said their accounts had been taken over entirely, their videos replaced with black screens and distorted whispers.

Then I found a video from a user called Mid86. It was grainy, the audio warped, but the message was clear.

“If you’re seeing this, you’ve already given it too much. Don’t engage. Don’t film. Don’t look for it. The more attention you give, the stronger it gets.”

The video cut to static for a moment before returning, showing Mid86 sitting in the dark. Their face was pale, eyes sunken with fear. They leaned in close to the camera.

“It feeds on attention. That’s how it finds you. That’s how it… takes you.”

I shivered, locking my phone and tossing it onto the bed. My heart raced as I replayed their words in my head. Was this what was happening to me? Was the algorithm itself somehow alive? It sounded insane—something straight out of a creepypasta or a bad movie. And yet, it felt surreal.

When I finally picked my phone back up, I noticed a string of new videos populating my FYP. Each one had the same eerie quality—abandoned places, cryptic whispers, and always that figure. But one video stopped me cold. It wasn’t just another random post. It was me.

The video showed me sitting on my bed, staring into my phone. But I wasn’t filming. My phone hadn’t even been in my hand at that moment. The figure was there, too, standing right behind me, its head tilted unnaturally. I could almost feel its cold gaze boring into me through the screen.

My stomach churned as I clicked on the user who had posted it: AlgoHost. Their profile was empty—no bio, no followers, no posts beyond that single video. But their username sent a chill down my spine. The algorithm. Could it actually be behind all of this?

I clicked the video again, and this time, something new appeared at the end—one word, scrawled in jagged white letters:

“LEAVE.”

That was when I noticed the location tag. It wasn’t random. It wasn’t even far away. The abandoned house I’d seen earlier? It was only a twenty-minute drive from mine.

I sat frozen, staring at the word on my screen. My chest felt tight, like a vice was slowly closing around my ribs. My phone vibrated in my hand, breaking the silence, and I almost dropped it. A notification from Blinksy: “Your followers are waiting!”

Waiting for what? I said to myself. My stomach churned. The app had started acting on its own over the past day—random notifications, videos playing without me tapping them. It felt like it had a will of its own, a mind that was no longer tethered to my control.

I decided I needed to prove I wasn’t losing it. My followers had to see this. Maybe they’d understand what was happening—or better yet, help me figure it out.

With trembling hands, I opened Blinksy and hit the Go Live button. My face filled the screen, pale and gaunt under the harsh light of my desk lamp. I tried to steady my voice as the viewers trickled in, their usernames scrolling up the side.

“Hey, guys,” I started, forcing a weak smile. “Something… weird has been happening. I need you to tell me if you see anything strange.”

The chat buzzed with initial confusion: “You okay, River?” “This is a prank, right?” “OMG, what’s wrong??”

I turned the camera to face the room, slowly panning across the walls, the bed, and the window. “Do you see anything?” I whispered. My voice cracked, betraying my nerves.

The responses came in fast, like “What’s that by the door?” “There’s something in the corner!”

and “Behind you!”

I spun the camera back toward myself, heart pounding. “What? Where?!” My voice was shrill, panic seeping in.

The chat erupted in chaos again, saying, “It moved!!” “Behind you, River! Turn around!” “Omg it’s so close!”

I whipped around, but there was nothing. Just my dimly lit room and the faint hum of my laptop. “You’re messing with me,” I muttered, trying to sound confident, but my voice was barely above a whisper.

And then the livestream froze.

The screen went black for a second before a new image replaced it. It was still me—but not in real-time. The screen showed me sitting at my desk, staring blankly into the camera, as if I were watching myself. My breath hitched. In the background of the live feed, the figure loomed, its head tilted, face obscured by shadow.

“Do you see it now?” a voice rasped from my phone’s speaker. It wasn’t my voice. It wasn’t anyone I recognized. The figure moved in the live feed, stepping closer to the frozen version of me on-screen.

I dropped my phone, the sound of the stream cutting out as it hit the floor. But before it went dark, one final notification appeared on the screen.

“Your POV is mine now.”

The room fell silent, but the feeling of being watched grew unbearable. I didn’t dare pick the phone back up. I didn’t dare look behind me.

I thought deleting Blinksy would be the end of it. After that horrific livestream, I uninstalled the app and turned off my phone, hoping the nightmare would fade like a bad dream. But my relief was short-lived. The silence that followed felt disturbingly quiet, empty.

The next morning, I woke to find my phone buzzing on my nightstand. That was strange because I knew I’d powered it down. When I picked it up, my lock screen showed a Blinksy notification that said, “New video posted by AlgoHost.” My stomach sank.

I was sure I deleted the app. But there it was, sitting on my home screen as if it had never left. My finger hovered over the icon, hesitant. Against my better judgment, I opened it. The app greeted me with the now-familiar distortion—the feed filled with static and fleeting, blurry images.

And then I saw it.

It was me. A video of me. Walking through the park near my house. My heart thudded. I hadn’t been to the park in weeks. In the video, I wore the same clothes I was wearing in that moment. The angle shifted, as if shot from the perspective of someone following closely.

Another video loaded. This time, I was standing outside my favorite coffee shop, staring blankly at the window display. I hadn’t gone there either. My breathing quickened as realization struck. Whoever—or whatever—was posting these videos had been using my likeness, my mannerisms, my life. But I wasn’t the one living it.

A comment appeared under the latest video: “You can’t hide. You’re already part of me.”

I put the phone down, heart racing. Turning off the phone clearly wasn’t enough. I needed a real solution, something drastic.

I grabbed my laptop and started researching digital hauntings, viral anomalies, anything that might explain what was happening. Forums were full of desperate posts about the #foryounightmare, each story eerily similar to mine. Users shared tales of shadowy figures, altered videos, and unshakable feelings of being watched. Most threads ended abruptly, with no resolution.

But one stood out.

A user named Mid86 had posted cryptic advice. “Going dark doesn’t save you. The algorithm doesn’t forget. You have to starve it of attention.” They went on to describe how the entity fed on engagement, fear, and curiosity—the very things that had lured me into its grasp.

I read further. Another post suggested disrupting the connection with a signal jammer—something strong enough to block the algorithm’s reach. My mind raced. If I could sever its link to me, maybe I could finally break free.

Later that day, I drove to an electronics store and bought a signal jammer, hands shaking the entire time. Back home, I unboxed it like it was a lifeline. I powered it on, its low hum filling the room, and waited. For a moment, nothing happened.

Then my phone buzzed.

A final notification flashed across the screen before glitching out entirely: “You can’t silence what’s already inside.” The words lingered before the screen went black.

For the first time in days, my phone stayed quiet. But the feeling of being watched? That never left.

The abandoned house loomed in front of me, a warped skeleton of wood and stone that seemed to breathe under the pale moonlight. I parked my car at the edge of the gravel driveway, its headlights cutting weakly through the dense fog. My phone buzzed in my hand, and I hesitated before glancing at the screen. The Blinksy notification read, “Welcome home.”

Every instinct screamed at me to turn back, but I had come too far to stop. The entity had dragged me into this nightmare, and I needed answers—an ending. Whether I’d escape or not didn’t matter anymore. I just wanted it to stop.

The front door was ajar, swinging slightly in the cold wind. I stepped inside, floorboards groaning beneath my weight. The air smelled damp, thick with mildew and decay, and my flashlight’s narrow beam barely held the darkness at bay. The interior was a frozen moment in time: dust-covered furniture, peeling wallpaper, and the faint outlines of long-forgotten picture frames on the walls.

My phone vibrated again. A new video had been uploaded to my feed. With trembling hands, I opened it.

The footage was of me, walking through the very room I stood in. My own flashlight beam danced across the screen, seconds ahead of reality. My breath caught as the video’s perspective shifted, focusing on a door at the end of the hallway. A faint tapping sound echoed from behind it—soft, deliberate, rhythmic.

I moved toward the door, my heartbeat syncing with the sound. With each step, the air grew colder, heavier. The tapping stopped as I reached out, my fingers brushing the chipped wood. The door creaked open on its own, revealing darkness that felt alive.

And then something moved.

The basement was colder than the rest of the house, the air damp and metallic like the breath of something waiting. My flashlight flickered as I descended the uneven wooden steps, each creak amplifying the suffocating silence. The glow from the monitors at the bottom cast eerie blue and green shadows, painting the room in sickly hues.

The screens lined the walls, each playing distorted Blinksys in endless loops. Familiar faces flickered across the displays—smiling, laughing, frozen in terror. I recognized some of them: creators I’d followed, users I’d seen tagged under the #foryounightmare hashtag. They weren’t just videos; they were moments, stolen and corrupted.

In the center of the room stood the server. It hummed with a low, droning pulse that resonated in my chest. Cables coiled around it like veins, tethering it to the monitors and the house itself. And then, from the shadows, it emerged.

At first, I thought it was human, but as it stepped closer, I saw the truth. Its body was a grotesque patchwork of faces, each shifting and melding into one another, mouths twitching, eyes blinking in a mismatched rhythm. Its voice was a chorus, layered and broken, speaking directly to me.

“You’re part of the pattern now,” it said. “Every click, every scroll feeds me. I am AlgoHost, and you are my content.”

I stumbled back, my flashlight trembling in my grip. The figure didn’t move closer—it didn’t have to. The room itself seemed to close in, the walls pulsating with the faces of the trapped.

I screamed, but the sound was swallowed by the monitors, distorted and looped back to me. My own face stared back from the screens, and the entity whispered, “Welcome to your new platform.”

The house came alive the moment I turned to run. The basement door slammed shut, and the stairs folded into themselves like a grotesque carnival trick. The air buzzed with the electric hum of the server, growing louder with each passing second. Monitors flickered wildly, displaying my face in distorted fragments.

The entity’s voice reverberated through the room, a chorus of overlapping whispers and screams. “You can’t leave. You are part of me now.”

I fought to keep my composure, recalling the advice from Mid86’s video: Don’t engage. Don’t look at it. Don’t feed it. I turned my back on the monitors, focusing on the server in the center of the room. The cables writhed like living things, snaking toward my feet.

The house began to shift. Walls rippled as if breathing, the room elongating and twisting. Doors appeared only to vanish the moment I reached for them. My pulse hammered as I dodged cables and ducked under low-hanging beams. My flashlight flickered, casting erratic shadows that seemed to mock my every move.

“You can’t escape,” the entity taunted. “Every step you take is mine to control.”

I gritted my teeth, refusing to meet its gaze on the screens. My phone buzzed in my pocket, a cruel reminder of its reach. Pulling it out, I stared at the Blinksy app. It had opened itself again, a live feed showing the basement from the entity’s point of view.

Desperate, I remembered the signal jammer tucked in my bag—a precaution I’d brought in case things went too far. Fumbling with shaking hands, I activated it. The hum of the server faltered, the monitors glitched, and the cables froze mid-slither.

The entity’s voice cracked, a distorted shriek echoing through the collapsing room. “You’ll never be free!” it screamed as I scrambled for the nearest exit, the house crumbling around me.

The house groaned, and its walls buckled under the weight of its collapsing reality. My fingers clenched around the signal jammer, the device trembling as if it, too, fought against the entity’s influence. Each step I took toward the server felt like walking through tar, the air thick with static and distorted screams.

“You can’t end this!” the entity bellowed, its voice shattering into fragments. “I am endless. I am you.”

I didn’t dare look at the monitors, though I could feel the weight of my own distorted reflection on every screen. The cables writhed again, weaker this time, but still reaching for me like dying tendrils. I tore one off my ankle and stumbled toward the server.

Memories of Mid86’s warning flooded my mind: It feeds on your fear, on your attention. Starve it. My breathing steadied as I realized the truth—I couldn’t let it control me anymore. I gripped the jammer tighter, its low buzz disrupting the digital haze around me.

“I’m done playing your game,” I said, my voice firm despite the chaos.

With one final burst of energy, I shoved the jammer into the server, forcing it into the whirring machinery. Sparks flew, and the monitors erupted into static. The entity’s screams turned guttural, a cacophony of rage and desperation.

The room began to collapse entirely, walls disintegrating into digital fragments. A wave of energy surged through me, like static electricity snapping against my skin. For a moment, I felt weightless, disconnected, as if my very consciousness had been untethered.

Then silence.

The house crumbled into nothingness, leaving me sprawled on the cold ground outside. My phone buzzed one last time, the Blinksy app flashing a simple message: “Connection lost.”

I staggered into the cold night, the remnants of the house gone as if it had never existed. My chest heaved with exhaustion, and the weight of silence pressed down on me. It felt alien after the chaos, the absence of the entity’s voice almost too quiet. My phone buzzed in my pocket, and I froze.

With shaking hands, I pulled it out. A single notification glowed on the cracked screen: “You’re free. For now.” The words sent a chill racing down my spine, but I dismissed it and stared at the Blinksy app. Against every instinct screaming at me, I opened it.

The FYP was... normal. Dance trends, pet videos, bad lip-syncing—all the mundane noise I once loved. But something was not right. Every time I scrolled, my reflection in the black frame of the screen seemed just a little... off. My smile lingered. My eyes followed me, even when I looked away.

I deleted the app without a second thought, my thumb hovering over the icon until it vanished. Relief flooded me, but it was fleeting.

At home, I tossed the phone on my desk and stared at my reflection in the darkened screen. I couldn’t tell if it was exhaustion or something more sinister, but my reflection didn’t seem to move in sync with me. My mouth twitched into a sharp grin.

A faint whisper echoed from the speaker, so soft it was almost imperceptible: “The pattern grows.”

I flung the phone across the room, and it landed with a dull thud. Its screen remained black, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that somewhere, deep in the code, the entity was waiting. Watching.

I don’t scroll anymore. But every time I see my reflection, I wonder if the algorithm still has [me](https://youtu.be/wt_uO_t8lKI).",1,1735833611.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

This chapter took far too long to get out. I had to deal with personal stuff for a while, then my birthday, Christmas and new years all came up so fast. I'm making it a goal this year to get a chapter out every two months at the latest.

I've said it before, and I'll say it again, I've not given up on my stories. Without further delay....

Knowings Chapter IX


*""I really don't envy you right now,"" Rue said with a bit of a smirk as we entered Tsula's home, Rue entering first. ""I wonder what Tsula wants to talk to us about?"" Rue asked aloud, not really talking to anyone in particular.*

*I could only wonder as we followed Luna to the living room, the house pleasantly cool due to central air conditioning.*

~ ~ ~

Luna lead us to the living room from the backdoor. Once there, I saw that Tsula was sitting in what I assumed was her usual spot, an expensive and well used recliner that looked quite comfortable. Rather than having her feet on the footrest, she had them on Spades' back. The big monster dog didn't seem to mind in the slightest and appeared to be snoozing, with his head on his paws. As Rue and I got closer, I could hear his snores.

""Your hound has just the right amount of warmth for my old feet,"" Tsula said to Rue as we entered the living room from the kitchen.

""I'm glad he can be of use to you,"" Rue said with a bit of a laugh, ""but I'm sure that's not why you wanted to talk to me and Arcturus.""

""No, no it's not,"" Tsula admitted, ""Recent events have led me to reevaluate some of my expectations I've had for you both. Especially after we almost lost you, Arcturus. If it weren't for Rue, you'd be dead right now. I've no idea how she managed to keep your soul tethered.""

""Neither do I,"" I said, ""I'm eternally grateful for whatever she did, as well as whatever you and Luna did as well. I saw all three of you doing... something to me to keep me from kicking the bucket.""

It was Luna that explained without prompting, ""Grandmother and I knitted your body back together from the worst of whatever happened to you and Rue made sure your soul didn't cross over the threshold."" She was smiling a bit as she continued her explanation, ""there was also a lot of excess mana flowing from Rue that we could use, I know Grandmother and I can't use it as effectively as you or her, but that helped us so much.""

I turned to Rue and had to ask, ""You didn't luminesce, did you?""

""No, I didn't,"" Rue stated, ""I made sure I didn't even flicker. I can keep souls from passing over with how skilled I am in my *Talent.* You should know my capabilities better than that.""

""I suspected, but had to make sure,"" I answered plainly. She truly was skilled in her *Talent,* far better than I could ever hope to be.

""I didn't ask both of you to come here so I could preen my feathers,"" Tsula said with a bit of a smile, ""while I enjoy boasting as much as the next woman, what I called you here for was to gift you something.""

Tsula gestured to the simple, wooden box on the coffee table. While I had noticed it before, my attention had been fully given to our hostess, since her mere presence demanded nothing less. Though I was far more capable than she ever could be, there was a weight and gravity to her soul and demeaner that I could only match with age and time.

Similar to that of Farnsworth, though I was much more informal with that crafty old geezer. There was a reason why my Father had respected his lanky ass, and it had nothing to do with the fact he could clean house in poker. Putting those thoughts to the side, Rue and I sat down as I heard my friend speak.

""You don't have to gift us anything,"" Rue said, ""we've already imposed so much on you without giving anything back.""

""Nonsense, Dear,"" Tsula said with a dismissive wave of her hand, ""I can't use it any more and the spirit inside is growing restless. It'll be of far greater use in either of your hands."" 

""What about gifting it to Luna?"" I asked, trying to deflect the gift. I knew my suggestion would fall onto deaf ears, but I had to ask anyways.

""Luna has far too much to learn from me to truly make use of *Noquisi.* Its far too angry and temperamental,"" Tsula said, then urged, ""go on, open it.""

""Alright,"" Rue said, acting first. She scooted forward a bit on the sofa and leaned forward to reach it.

Picking up the box, her face showed a bit of surprise as her muscles tensed, showing that it was heavier than she had anticipated. Placing it on her lap, Tsula said as she unlatched the simple, golden clasp as the lock and key had already been removed and placed on the table. Inside, was a revolver with intricate etchings neatly and delicately carved into each component and part of the weapon.

*""Noquisi,""* Tsula said, ""what her name means, I'm sure the implications aren't lost on you.""

I could sense Rue looking at it with her perception, threading the smallest bit of what remained of her mana into the tattoos on her hands to truly look at it as I was looking at it as well. Once more, Rue beat me to voicing my thoughts as she turned it over in her hands.

""It *is* angry,"" Rue said, her eyes and the tattoos on her hands glittering ever so slightly, ""and holds such sorrow. What happened to make this *object* have such a personality and will?""

""We hedge wizards are capable of doing whatever you mages are able to do, it just takes far greater time, effort and energy, and the effect is far more real and substantial for it,"" Tsula said, ""I made two of these, and gifted one to my husband. A mated pair, as it were.""

I understood what Tsula was getting at, having experienced something similar.

*""Noquisi,""* I said, ""is angry and hurt at the loss of its mate, and rightly so.""

""Yes,"" Tsula said, adjusting her feet on top of Spades, the giant dog not even noticing as he continued to snooze, ""which would serve you two well. She has a particular hatred towards *Things* and other creatures pretending to be human.""

Once more, threading metaphysical inflection into spoken words seemed to drain the older woman, however, as she was already in a recliner she simply waved off the concerned look from her granddaughter. Composing herself, she continued on, ""It's been decades since I've fired it, but I've kept it up as best as my old bones could, and I've no doubt that you two can bring back her old glory.""

Rue gazed at the weapon, the mana threaded through her perception slowly ebbed away as she spoke, ""I think I want this. I've been relying on my magic too much anyway and need to have other capabilities and ways to fight. Now more than ever.""

""I won't argue about that, and I have my own pistol. Besides, it shouldn't be too hard to find ammo for it, and I need to see if Arclight is alright and get some stuff from him.""

Tsula smiled as she spoke, ""Now that that matter is settled, I believe that you both should direct your energies towards healing. Luna and I will help however we can. Right now, however, I feel it's time for a light lunch.""

~ ~ ~

""Thank you, again, for everything,"" I heard Rue say to Tsula and Luna as I tightened up the cargo straps on Rue's truck.

We had stayed at their home for a little over a week -- nine days. During that time, Rue and I recovered as much as we could. Enough time had passed that I could manifest a mending for us both twice. I admit that I had pushed our bodies a little too hard and such strain showed in our movements.

Tsula and Luna had aided me in that regard. Their capabilities heightened the limitations of the *Knowing,* improving and building onto it far more than the base principles allowed. Even with this boon, Rue and I were still stiff and sore, like doing a hard day's labor without a meal nor break. This only served to remind me that I needed to learn higher principles of body mending, an arduous task, all things considered. Though, an actual instructor would speed things along greatly.

The only ones to come to mind were Guy and Sasquatch.

Spades hopped onto the back, rocking the truck a bit from his weight. I put the heavy chain back onto is thick collar, ruffling his ears a bit playfully. Rue was still talking to Luna, trying to stall for time, not that I blamed her. Though our bodies had been patched up, as well as the structure and durability of our minds and souls, we had come to learn what had been lost.

Rue had told me after a bout of loveless passion one night, that her feelings of love and emotional connection to Procyon had been harmed. Ablated and eaten away by the *Thing* that had been trying to possess her. My brutal removal of it certainly didnt help either. She had come to understand it as she mourned him as a good friend rather than as someone that was on the path to being something much more. As for myself, I'd lost memories, not strong ones, not anything I actually cared dearly for and certainly nothing that would alter my personality nor morals. I'd lost small ones, a great many number of them as well. Things such as a particularly beautiful sunset or sunrise, specifics of mundane conversations, the name and face of that one guy who still owes me $100. My rudimentary psychic skills let me figure out where the holes and gaps were in my mind, I'd be unable to do so otherwise.

Rue tapped me on the shoulder as she spoke to me, ""Hey, everything good? You were spaced out for a bit.""

""Yeah, I'm fine,"" I said neutrally, ""just thinking about things lost. Anyways, Everything's packed and ready to go.""

""Good, I guess it's time we get back on the road then,"" Rue said, opening the driver's side door, continuing to speak once I got into the passenger seat, ""we'll have to stop by a graveyard tonight.""

""For your mysterion, right?""

""Yeah, but that's not for a few more hours a least.""

I let the matter drop as she started up her truck. Mysterions were held secret, and each path had their own methods in performing them. I still didn't know what they all were, and never bothered to really ask about it. With the way Rue was acting about hers, the mysterion had to have been distasteful to her.

I didn't realize I had lapsed into silence until Rue spoke to me, the truck bouncing a little as it went over the gate tracks, ""Hey, Arc? Let me know where we're going, you're the navigator now. That means driver chooses the tunes.""

She had already connected her phone to the stereo via Bluetooth and was searching for a station on one of her streaming services. Settling on one, she let it play at a volume level where we could still have a conversation without yelling at one another.

""Alright, Themz The Rulez,"" I said, emphasizing the 'Z' sounds as I got out my well worn map. It was the same one I had used in the hotel room so many days ago and needed to be replaced soon despite the care I put into it.

""Anyways, we need to travel up through the ass end of NC and get to the edge Tennessee, should be a few days travel,"" I said then added, ""maybe half a week.""

""Sounds doable,"" Rue stated, driving onto the street, then asked, ""that's, what, the Twenty-Six all the way up to  Ashville?""

""Yeah, with a stop or two along the way, on top of whatever it is that you need to do for your mysterion,"" I answered, not bothering to actually use the GPS feature on my phone. It was pretty much a straight shot to Ashville once we got onto the interstate.

""Don't remind me,"" Rue said in annoyance, ""I'll probably have to perform it three or four times before I'm comfortable with my mana reserves.""

""Take a left up here, then on Greenstone make a right, should lead you to the main road,"" I said, remembering the directions on how to get out of the neighborhood, ""I'm not familiar with your mysterion, with the way you go on about it, it sounds terrible.""

Rue murmured in assent as I gave her driving directions, then said, ""Yeah, I hate it. The mysterion of my path let's me strike a bargain with Ssomething That Was.* Whatever specter I agree with gets semi control and full sensation of my body and I get mana, to whatever I agree to.""

""So you get possessed?""

""Not quite,"" Rue answered, pausing as she looked for oncoming traffic on the main road, taking a left, ""it's more like... I'm the instructor of a student driver in a dual control car. I can see and experience everything, but I'm not really in control unless i want to be. Though, that can probably break contract, unless it were an emergency or the specter broke their end of the deal.""

""I can see how that can be unpleasant,"" I said, still trying to understand it. I'm sure she was leaving things out, or the concepts and principles could only be truly understood by those of her own path.

""Yeah,"" Rue murmured, ""I'll need to do it quite a few times, and I'd like you nearby for my ease of mind. Just release your aura a bit, it'll help increase my price and keep malicious spirits at bay.""

""I can do that,"" I said, already starting to understand a bit, ""I'd be like... a bouncer, assuming your body is the night club.""

""Not quite the analogy I was looking for, but it's pretty on the nose.""

""I can definitely see why you'd find your mysterion unpleasant,"" I said again with more understanding of how it worked. While the exact nature of it would never be fully in my grasp, I could understand this much. I continued, ""I'll definitely keep you safe. It might be unpleasant if I have to kick a ghost out of you.""

""Yeah, you're not skilled enough to be nice about it,"" Rue said with an involuntary shudder, ""I know first-hand, ya know?""

""Yeah, I am sorry about that, but I did what I could with what I had available. It wasn't much.""

""I never said I didn't thank you for that, I know that *Thing* had a deep hold on my soul.""

""Fuck yeah, it did,"" I said, the memory of that ordeal still fresh in my mind, ""I'm glad that's over. Though, I'm not sure how this wendigo thing will turn out.""

It was a while before Rue spoke up again. I could tell she was trying to gather her thoughts and when she finally voiced them, we were turning onto the interstate, ""Well, you're offering them new magic, no one's done that before, so I think we have a decent shot at getting through their territory.""

""Yeah,"" I said, a little dismissively, my true focus back on my own mysterion. I was pulling waste heat from the truck's engine and I had to be a little careful in order to prevent it from getting too cold and damaging it.

We lapsed into silence, Rue listening and occasionally singing along to whatever her streaming service played as I gained mana.

It was a very slow process.

~ ~ ~

Hours later, Rue parked the truck in an out of the way parking spot at a rest stop, one that catered to RVs and big rigs on cross country routes or trips. While it wasn't sleazy and clean enough, I didn't recognize the company that owned it.

""I figured it was time for lunch,"" Rue said, turning off the truck, ""and I bet Spades needs a walk.""

""Yeah,"" I agreed, rousing my mind to the here and now, abandoning my mysterion, ""we have been driving for a while. Want me to take him or are you?""

""I'll do it, and we're good on gas so just get us some food? Besides, I don't think you want to pick up his shit,"" she said with a bit of a laugh.

I looked at Spades, and shook my head, ""Yeah, no thanks. I'll pass on that.""

As we got out, and closed the doors, Spades perked up from his spot next to Lola and made the truck rock further as he placed his massive paws on the edge of the bed, clearly excited. I heard Rue speak next to me as she twisted the heavy duty, letter-based combination lock. We had set it up together during our stay at Tsula's home. It read: BESTBOY, and was pretty on the nose about the giant monster dog. When he jumped onto the worn and cracked asphalt, I could almost hear the truck heave a great sigh of relief.

Perhaps it actually did, machines had spirits, after all. I did a double-take with more focused *Perception,* though not fully flared out. The machine spirit was quite dormant, appearing as nothing more than mere background noise. I'd have to keep an eye out for more disturbances, neither Rue nor I needed to have to deal with such a finicky being. Though, with my focused *Perception,* I did notice something about Lola.

""Hey, Rue,"" I said, getting her attention as she walked away towards the grass, ""small change of plans.""

""Oh?"" She asked, pausing to let me further explain.

""I'm gonna go on a short ride on my motorcycle, I should be back in about an hour.""

""Need to give that dog of yours a walk, huh?"" Rue asked with a bit of a knowing smile, then elaborated a bit, ""I've pulled back Spades so many times, I know a dog's soul like it's second nature. Just don't take too long, alright?""

""Fair enough,"" I said as I unlatched various ties and restraints that held my motorcycle down to the truck. Once on the asphalt, I said to the machine as I patted the control panel with respect and fondness, ""let's get you on a walk.""

I could feel Lola become excited as we went on a 'walk,' the machine revving up much faster than normal and the acceleration far harder as well.

~ ~ ~

My ride about had taken a little longer than I had anticipated to complete. Lola hadn't been 'walked' since I stowed her away into the back of the truck, so it made sense, in a way. Her spirit had worn itself out and was ready for a good, long slumber.

""What took so long?"" Rue asked me as I sat down, sipping on a beer from a glass bottle, ""Me and Spades have been waiting *foooorrrreeeeeeveeeeerrrr.""* She drew out the word with so much sarcasm piled onto it, it was obvious she was just messing around and held no mirth nor ill will.

""Sorry about that, Lola had more pent up energy than I expected,"" I said as I sat down, giving Spades a head pat as I did so. He went back to laying down on the floor, curling up and snoozing. ""What'cha drinking?"" I asked, settling into the bench-like seat, opposite Rue.

""Some kind of craft IPA, it's pretty good, might get another one,"" she said with a shrug, ""I'd get more than a few, if I could, but I'm driving. Speaking of, you need to learn how to drive stick, I'm not always going to be around to be your personal chauffeur."" She said that last part in a playful and mocking accusation.

""Yeah, yeah, I know, it's on my to-do list,"" I said, ""I never really needed to learn it, always had a *Knowing* that let me intuit the machine, but now, I can't spend mana like that.""

""Speaking of mana,"" Rue said, ""I did some preliminary research on the net, there's a graveyard not too far from here, I plan to go there later tonight, so we need to get a room or something.""

""Alright, I'll--""

*""Number 67? Number 67 your order is ready,""* a voice called out on the intercom, interrupting me, the old system sounding like a bad drive through speaker.

""That's us,"" Rue said after swallowing from the beer, ""I went ahead and ordered for both of us, and Spades, too. Now come on and help me.""

With a sigh, I got right back up and went to help Rue carry back the two trays of food. The food Rue and I brought back was alright. Typical diner fare, really. Chicken and mashed potatoes for herself and a burger and fries for me, with all the fix-ins on the burger, while spades had some kind of boiled... sludge-like substance that had the audacity to call itself edible in a large pot on the floor.

""How did you convince anyone to do that for Spades?"" I asked incredulously once we sat and everything was settled.

""A woman has her ways,"" Rue replied mischievously, batting her eyelashes in sarcastic exaggeration.

""Fine then, keep your secrets,"" I stated, jabbing a particularly large french fry at her.

""I most certainty will,"" She replied, then actually answered, ""I asked, that was it. Offered to pay fifty bucks to what was going to be thrown out anyways. Besides, look at Spades! He's been such a good boy!""

Spades didn't bother with a response, he was scarfing down the food-like sludge as though he hadn't eaten in over a week.

""Yes, he's the best boy,"" I readily agreed, ""but I have to wonder, where does it all go?""

""No fucking clue,"" was all Rue could say.

I was still wondering that when spades tried to ask for more. 

~ ~ ~

Later that night, we booked a room at a cheap and sleazy motel. Some run-down shit hole of a place that didn't ask questions to deeply, and the receptionist seemed to not want to know either, as he already knew what kind of shady clientele the place attracted.

""Room's twenty-three,"" the clerk said through a scratchy and worn speaker from behind thick glass, pushing a metal security tray with my card and room key, back to me, ""first floor, by the pool.""

""Thanks"" I said, grabbing my stuff then looking for where Rue parked. It didn't take long to find her, there were few cars parked. spades noticed me approach first as Rue was doing something on her phone.

""Werf!"" Spades barked out lightly in excitement at seeing me again. As I gave Spades head pats and scritches, I waited to see now long it would take Rue to notice I was back. Since it was taking a bit of time for her to notice, I glanced at her to get a better idea of what had her so engrossed on her phone. She was looking at old pictures of Procyon and herself on her camera reel and, flipping through a messaging application.

""Let's give your Rue some space, shall we?"" I asked Spades as I unlatched him from the truck, ""We can go on a quick walk.""

""Werf!""

Spades didn't need a leash to be walked, he was well behaved and quite smart as far as dogs went. The big monster dog was always a few paces ahead or behind me, sniffing this and that. He stopped and became quite alert whenever he heard a squirrel in the under brush at the edges of the worn and cracked asphalt. He plodded along then went into the bushes and marked a tree. He did this a few more times, struggling to find pee for the last tree near the treeline.

It seemed that all dogs were the same.

Walking towards the edge of the asphalt to keep an eye on my four-legged friend, I heard him snort then rub his side against the rough bark of the tree, scratching himself. As he did so, I  went to take a better look at what he was doing since something felt off. There was a sort of tugging at the edge of my vision, prompting me to engage my *Perception* as Spades did the same thing to another tree. The hound had used part of his powers to not only superficially char the bark of the tree, but had also left a kind of supernal mark on it that declared it as part of his territory.

""C'mon, spades, "" I said, ""You have other trees this way."" I started to walk along the perimeter of the motel, letting Spades mark and scorch whatever tree, wall, or car as his. There were few things willing to cross a beast such as a hell hound, and I hoped it would offer some kind of protection to us.

It wasn't long before we were back at the truck. I strapped Spades back in and let him take his spot in the bed. Rue had set up a spot for him with a lot of blankets. There was just enough room for him to lay down and stretch, but not much else. Our gear was secured with heavy straps, netting and steel pins. The ramp for my motorcycle was braced sheet metal and hung on the driver side with special hooks. I had spent precious mana when building it at Tsula's since I didn't have the proper tools on hand.

Rue finally noticed something was amiss as Spades made himself comfortable, rocking the truck In bit with his weight as he did so. Rue opened the door, exiting and closing it behind her. She saw me making sure that Spades was locked in properly.

""Were you waiting long?"" She asked, ""I didn't mean to zone out like that.

""It's alright,"" I answered, ""I know what it's like to lose someone you love. Anyway, room's twenty-three, do you want to get settled in first?""

""Yeah, I think so,"" Rue answered, moving hair out of her face and tucking it behind her ear, ""then we can go to that graveyard. Also, thanks for understanding. You of all people, know what it's like. I know my feelings and memories for Procyon got all fucked over, but, that... longing... it won't go away, will it?""

It was clear she was still struggling to make sense of all that had been done to her. Though her soul and mind had both been structually restored, there were bits of both that were lost and could never be recovered. 

I sighed and learned back against the truck. It was a few moments before I answered. ""No, it won't, but the pain dulls over time. You get used to them not being there that they're really and actually gone. Sometimes, from a smell, a stray memory, some innocuous comment, will bring back a rush of sorrow and pain. It'll bring back other memories, of dumb things they did, of smiles and laughter. In time, you'll remember them for those things, rather than for them being gone .""

""You're right,"" Rue said, wiping at her eyes, ""I Didn't expect such wisdom from someone known as Shithead.""

""That's one of the reasons why I never bothered to actually change it. Keeps people guessing or underestimating me.""

""I was wondering about that a little bit,"" Rue stated, adjusting after her weight from one foot to the other. The emotional turmoil she had been enduring no longer at the forefront of her mind. She was going to have to endure the desyncronization between mind and soul on her own, and for a very long time, unless it could be mystically repaired. Neither she nor I had such spiritual or psychic skill.

She Continued, drawing me from my thoughts,"" I think Sir Fuckington is doing the same. But, gods... I hate that nickname..""

""Pretty much,"" I said, ""but look at the results of it. We're still here.""

*""We're still here,""* Rue said echoing the same tone I had spoken with. ""We're still here,"" she said again, an edge to her voice.

There was a bit of an awkward silence between us.

""Uh, you ready?"" I asked Rue after few more moments.

""Yeah,"" She replied, ""let's put some stuff away and then we can go. We'll have to go on foot. There's no guarantee that whoever pays up can drive stick..."" There was a kind of admonished, accusatory edge to her last sentence that only a woman was able to pull off.

""I'll learn, I promise! Though, let's take Lola instead,"" I suggested. I knew I had to learn stick, just as she had to learn how to drive a motorcycle now that we had gotten her a proper helmet.

""Right,"" Rue answered, ""Not used to being on one.""

We had to finagle all the stuff around to get the motorcycle out. Again. At least Spades was happy with the extra room.

The Journey to the graveyard in question was spent in quiet contemplation, with Rue shouting the occasional direction at me. We had left a bunch of our stuff in the motel room, having paid for a two day stay. While we did ward our room, taking time in weaving the combined *Knowing* to conserve mana, our most valuable items had been locked in the cab of the truck. We had no doubt that Spades could break the long length of chain if he really wanted to, and due to it being twilight, not many would think of anything about him left in the truck.

Since it was still in the middle of summer, the evening was quite warm out. No longer physically nor mystically hurt, we were in good spirits as we got off the motorcycle, the spirit of Lola quite happy with the extra 'walk.' It seemed that she was settling in quite nicely, becoming a more permanent facet of the motorcycle. Looking at her with a focused bout of my *Perception,* I could tell that it would not be long for it to become her new body.

Dogs were man's best friend for a reason.

Patting the headlight as I took out the key, I asked Rue, looking around a bit in doing so, ""This is the place, huh?""

""Yeah, it is,"" she said as she took off her helmet, holding it against her side a little awkwardly, showing she wasn't used to having one, ""shouldn't be too hard to jump the fence, and it's more dark than light out.""

""Yeah, it'll also be easier to hide from the cameras,"" I said, ""I'm going to make us invisible, be warned, it's a little weird, and don't move too fast, it's a lesser version, so it might break the weave.""

""Alright,"" Rue acknowledged, ""is it a collapse event?""

""Nah, it won't keep up and just fail, dissolving harmlessly,"" I answered back, performing the *Knowing* and taking my time with weaving it together. I wanted to go slow so as to prevent aura bleeding into the area around us and making us easier to track and suppressing the actual resonance of an active spell. As the mysticism was from the Aether, I didn't need to expend mana to create it.

Invisibility was a peculiar thing. It wasn't anything like what was portrayed in mainstream media. In a technical sense, visible light was warped in such a way as to hide a person or object from viewing by another, this also had the bizarre effect of making yourself invisible to your own eyes, you also left a physical trace, such as footprints or displaced air in fog. Interestingly, you couldn't see where any part of your own body was and had to rely on your own kinesthetic abilities. I was used to moving around like this, Rue most certainly wasn't.

""This is so weird,"" she said, ""I'm not sure I like this.""

""Come on, let's walk in and see what's up, I don't feel like climbing the fence if I can help it.""

""Yeah, I can see how that would be a problem,"" she said with a bit of a laugh.

We stayed silent as we walked right into the graveyard holding hands so we wouldn't get separated. It wasn't exactly gated, but there was a security checkpoint. The reason became clear to us as to why the actual metal gate fence wasn't engaged. There were multiple maintenance crews busy doing something and it looked like they were just setting up. No doubt trying to get something big done at night and out of the blazing sun.

After a few minutes of awkward walking, I heard Rue speak to me in a whisper, ""We need to go this way, so I'm taking the lead. Follow me.""

""Okay.""

She led us to the top of a hill dominated by a big tree. There didn't appear to be anything special about it, other than the fact that it was the biggest thing around. The air was much cooler now that it was actually night, and there was a light breeze to the air as well. We were also far enough away from the work crews so that I could suppress the effects of my *Knowing* without canceling it as I didn't want to reweave it into being.

""That's better,"" Rue said to me, ""that was too weird for me to want to do again. Anyways, just stand there and let your presence be known. I'm going to look for a ghost willing to pay the cost of renting out my body.""

""Sure, you go ahead and do your thing,"" I said back to her as she meandered through the headstones.

I pulled out my trusty zippo and began to twirl it between my fingers as though it were a coin. It wasn't actually skill that let me do it so easily. I was directly manipulating the momentum, direction and inertia to suit my whims, using an orison to do so. It was a teaching tool used to help strengthen precision accuracy rather than bullish power. The orison also let my presence be known by the dead as I made no effort to conceal the aura of it. I wasn't doing anything fancy as I could have done, instead, my attention was focused on my friend performing her mysterion.

She began whispering as she walked around the area, seemingly looking at things I couldn't see. There wasn't anything flashy, no sigils or glyphs that usually heralded advanced knowledge manifesting itself on the material. Peering at her with my *Perception,* I could see that she was talking to the dead. She had mastery over Things That Were, though, if a dead thing were strong or particularly vile and hateful, that influence would mean nothing. She pointed towards me, and I could see that the spirits looked over to me as well.

I couldn't make out the details of their spectral forms, even with my *Perception* fully opened, that wasn't in my capabilities. Not at this distance anyways. The dead had a different way of perceiving and sensing the world around them, and could sense the strength and weight of my magic as I used such a small part of it when twirling my zippo around my fingers. Some of the specters gathered around Rue simply left as she could enforce whatever terms she wanted from the deal she was making.

Looking at Rue, she shook the hand of one of the transparent figures and it merged into her living body. She stumbled and fell down onto her hands and knees, breathing hard and fast, swaying a bit from side to side as she did so.

Running up to her quickly, my mind racing to figure out what kind of soul magic I needed to use, I asked, ""Talk to me, who are you and what have you done?""

""Just... give... me... a... mo... ment...""

The voice was definitely Rue's, but the tone and inflections were all over the place, as though whatever was inside was having great difficulties in managing the muscles responsible for speaking. I waited as the being inside Rue's body calmed down, and her breathing eased.

""What a rush...."" the specter said in a voice was definitely feminine, but not Rue's as she shakily got into a standing position. ""I nearly forgot what being alive was like.""

""Who are you and where is Acrux?"" I asked, my voice having an unmistakable hard edge to it as i continued to flip my zippo around and through my fingers. Only this time the flame was lit up.

""She's still there, safe and sound, chilling up in here,"" the specter said tapping the side of Rue's head, ""I expended *a lot* of my mantle to use this body, enough for a whole day and a half. Let me get used to it, then I can have some fun!""

The next thirty-six hours were going to be filled with stress and anxiety. I already felt the beginnings of a migraine forming.

~ ~ ~

The *Things* that preyed upon us were right to be scared. Despite their machinations to stomp out supernal truths from the world, and even against the stifling smothering brought into being by the Lie, tenets of it remained. Not only that, those smoldering embers of truth burned bright and hot.

Now, however, what we all thought to have been true, that we mystics were actually able to grow our numbers and fight back, had been naught but another Lie. I knew, the instant all those *Things* had come into the material, that we had been betrayed.

Betrayed by one of our own.

This had been planned for, and countermeasures had been set up, though we hoped it would never come to be. I looked back, focusing on the dark shapes that hounded our escape. *They* had found us far sooner than anticipated and though none of us had been killed, the twelve of us were heavily injured, out of mana and our raiments had been depleted months ago. Since i was at the back of our entourage, I had to defend us from *Their* potent dreadlight, which was getting harder and harder to accomplish.

As I sent another elemental to buy us precious time, I was so very thankful that Oracle had gotten away. Our troupe had been a diversion and *They* fell for it. In mere hours, our physical bodies would be held in gilded cages, safe from *Them* at the cost of almost everything. Such was the high price of fey sanctuary.

Oracle had to succeed.

Fate *depended* upon it.

this was 9 years ago, almost 10. 
i was minding my own business as a 20yo when i saw a girl (19yo) trying to pick up a rose from a garden, she was getting really frustrated so i decided to help.
I took out some thorns with my fingers and then eventually plucked the rose out. intrigued by what she was gonna do with it i said: Usually i see guys taking roses from this spot, who you gifting this rose to? your boyfriend?
she giggled and looking at me in the eyes, she said: to myself
i took a few seconds to say something cause in that moment, she looked so pretty that i just froze with a million thoughts in my mind and that moment just going in loop on my head.
while i was frozen she bumped me in the shoulder and said: ""well you're gonna give me the rose or no?"" i shaked my head like i was just awaken and replied with: ""ermm... but... yeah ofc, but now its my gift to you so its no longer a rose for yourself but a gift from a stranger""
she laughed, and my brain was still half processing her: the way her hair was so puffy and half curly, like a lions mane, majestic, framing her beautiful face, her eyes light brown like a autumn leaf embellishing a grey sidewalk with its presence, her nose, small and slightly curved upwards, her cheeks a bit rosed but filled with life and her lips... damn i couldn't stop staring at her lips.
so she thanked me and went to go away but i said:Wait, can we meet again here tomorrow, same time?
she asked:why? 
And for some reason (nowadays i realize i was a idiot to straight up spilling a bit of my guts like that, but life funny enough to ocasionally make it work) i decided to say: To be honest, I don't even know. but i know i want to be in your life as much as i can, this is... if you allow me to.
she, that was able to look me in the eyes, got shy, started looking down a bit, and kinda quietly said: now I can't even talk straight, damn you, okay... but you better bring some snacks.
i nodded and she left rather quickly, i felt like my heart was gonna explode and so damn happy.
and that's how i met her, im not gonna enter in too much detail into what happened the next day but we ended up dating for a few years.
She was a tough woman, sensitive but no bs, with a soft side large enough to be too kind for her own good and always smiling. I wouldn't be exaggerating to say that i worshipped that woman and i felt like it was fully reciprocated. she was the love of my life, and the moment i actually found that out was when after we made love for the first time, she was a virgin and i was already experienced, so i made all i could for her to feel good, i lit up candles, incense, made a whole compilation of her favorite romantic musics to play, took it slow, made sure to tell her (even maybe a bit too many times) that if she wanted we could stop and just talk for a bit, made some french toast for her afterwards... so after the deed was done so to speak, and i got into the bed after giving her some french toast, she was sitting on the bef next to me eating and i lit up a cigarette when she was almost finishing, using the empty can of coca cola she drank with it as a ashtray. once she finished she snatched the cigarette out of my hand and took a drag, rested her head against my chest, exhaled and looking towards me said: even if this feeling goes away i hope you don't, cause you're my strong side and i have no clue on what i would do without you, will you stay with me forever? please? 
my heart melted, i fought through tears to be able to respond.
and i did, we never spent more than a day apart, i went with her to meet family members,  we scheduled our lifes so we could always be together at some point through the day, to the point where i more than once came to her house after work, at 11 pm just to stay with her for 30 minutes and go home, and her... going to my place in the morning whenever she knew i had to work only to wake me up a bit earlier, make me some coffee, cuddle on the couch and then leave with me. it was to the point where her father after we dated for one year called me over, gave me a copy of their keys and said: i see you more often than i see my wife, just take this, im sick of having to get up from the couch to open you the door man. 
it was perfect...
one day during the Summer she went to her parents vacation home, it was a pretty area, surrounded by woods, with a little pond nearby. and i couldn't go but i told her that i would go the next day cause she forgot my vacation days were scheduled for the next day and lasted 2 weeks, so we said goodbye and she went. i went to work and when i got home i saw the news, the area she was on had a wildfire that blocked the road and people living in the neighboring village trying to flee (cause they feared the fire was coming that way, and it kinda was) got into that road, causing a traffic jam due to the fire blocking the road, ofc eventually the fire ended up completely taking over the surroundings of said road and over 15 people died trapped in their cars. i was panicking, i called and called her phone but nothing. i bawled my eyes out, and the next day... the next day her brother knocks on my door and starts crying immediately, between screams and sobs i understood, I didn't asked him, i knew... her funeral was one of the hardest things i had to endure, i just cried like a baby grabbed to her father as he, that was crying kept saying in a trembling voice: i know son, i know my boy. nature really gave me something to cherish, and ended up taking it away.

I wake up every day literally shivering from anxiety, without a specific reason. I remember shivering and in the summer, even when my room was at 35°C!

I have reached a point where I hate sleep itself, because I know what expects me in the morning (or whatever time I wake up, it doesn't make a difference the time I wake up, it's always there). As soon as I ""gain consciousness"" when waking up, my BPM usually spikes hard, I breath intensively and sometimes it's so bad that I'm literally moaning. It takes a whole hour after waking up to feel somewhat normal. (I don't drink coffee, just 3-4 cups of green tea a day).

I'm tapering benzos (currently on 1,5mg/day in Xanax equivalency as I use various very long half life benzos for the taper, but keep this equivalent dosage in mind).

Anybody has this kind of morning anxiety ? I don't know how to make it stop. It has devastated whatever quality of life I have remaining.

>!Basically, due to my stupidness using benzos daily, I ended up with 3 seizures total, each time I tried to get off (all 3 times I stopped them impoperly, thus the seizures) and have now pretty much zero medication-anxiety shields. (*Maybe alcohol only, but due to downregulated GABA receptors, it needs like a lot of alcohol to bypass the gabaergic tolerance plus I don't like it. Only dissos/strong NMDA antagonists work by blocking glutamate. It feels like a benzo because benzos raise the GABA levels and glutamate is blocked. Dissos do that the other way.

How to overcome this?,"As the title, I thought it's maybe me who misunderstood the situation, but I can't ignore his eyes on my body.

He's my supervisor in a recent grad diploma that I got this year, and I have been working with him on a project which didn't end yet.

He travelled abroad this winter, so I thought that maybe his travel will prevent any unwanted/uncomfortable things that happened or any side talks that he insisted on, but he kept wasting most of the meetings time.

I thought again that maybe I was getting things wrong? but I had a meeting with him with sound on and no headphones, to let my friend in the same room decide whether this is normal or not.

 I felt very uncomfortable that I told him when he offered recommending me to the same uni where he is now, that I'm in relationship and shall travel to my partner in US very soon (this is true actually), but it didn't stop him very long.

Last week, When he travelled back to our country he asked to have coffee together, not a meeting, which I didn't do. 

I didn't submit my application earlier bc things happened so I will do so in Jan and Feb, and I thought that maybe I could handle it, bc my situation is very bad, he was my last hope.

The reason why I tried all these months to handle things, is that I had a very bad gpa in BSc, but he is:
-  in the same specialization that I want to work on during my PhD, which aligns also to my research experience with him
- I'm 4 y away from school, and he's my supervisor in a recent degree, which makes ideal to mention that my bad grades in BSc doesn't represent my research capabilities currently. 

The point is I can't do this anymore. I won't complete the experimental work or request his LOR again.
 I hate his voice, seeing his name requesting a call/meeting. I really want to get a PhD admission so badly, but I don't want his LOR if it means that all his attempts will continue. maybe I could do it without him. 

I know that I missed now my opportunity to get the best LOR that could increase my chances, but I have nothing to do.

After feeling disrespected and ignored 8 weeks ago, I'd set boundaries in a 3 month relationship with a F48, I'm M51 - 7 weeks ago. We'd made plans to chat about things and chatted up til 6 weeks ago, but she didn't reach when she said she would and I was honestly okay with it. The entire relationship was full of hot and cold, ghosting, canceled plans, blatant lies, lack of good communication and lots of inconsistencies. My boundaries were about lack of communication and inconsistencies and were set after 3 months of second guessing her commitment to our relationship. 

Well last night she called and we chatted for 15-20 minutes. She shared what's been going on for her and I did the same. I put in a lot of effort towards our relationship but most of the time it felt like a 70(me)/30(her)%. I understood factors of why she might not be able to apply more effort, but it honestly started to feel like I ended up making excuses for her and her lack of effort. Maybe she just didn't have the same feelings for me, but the lack of communication of serious things left me second guessing things constantly. 

She said sorry last night for how she'd handled things and ended the conversation saying she missed me. I'd said maybe we could grab a coffee sometime, leaving that up to her to reach out if it was something she wanted - which I do regret a little. She did thank me for making the conversation so easy and said it was hard to make the call but she knew she needed to do so. 

It just feels like on my end, I wasn't feeling fulfilled with the relationship and the thought of trying to re navigate into something with her again would end in disappointment again. Her calling and saying yes to a coffee, presents an opportunity to express my feeling more in depth and if she made me feel she's interested in something deeper for me to set further boundaries of how I can see a positive relationship happening between us. I've known this women for most of my life, with her grandparents living across from my parents, with our families having deeper connections. So I'm stuck wondering if it's better if and when that coffee happens to just say I do care deeply for her but it's better for us to remain friends like we were before and support each other as friends.

Secondly, I like men, I love being with men but it's so troubling to manage to go out with them. I live in a country where being gay/bi is really stereotypical, which is fair, but it's not the type of man that I'm attracted to, so trying to meet socially more, in lack of a better word, discrete and more masculine men is difficult, really difficult.

I've tried Tinder and Bumble, for both men and women, and men there just don't answer after matching or ghost you after a few messages. With grindr I will not even comment... I've been using it for the past year and only managed to actually make 2 hook-ups happen (one of them lasted regularly for like 3 months), either because guys act really weird through text or because they are just trying to jerk off and get some validation.

The problem is that I consider myself a bottom and I usually use my house for hosting, and I don't want to have someone in my place with whom I don't feel safe, especially given the fact I'm the one that gets in a more submissive position overall. Sometimes I'd like to grab a cup of coffee, even if we are just meeting for sex. Still, most of them don't even want to show their faces (???), like why should I waste my time going out, getting myself ready, and preparing everything just to be surprised by a man who's, most likely, not attractive to me...?

I'm aware that I'm still young (22) and socially attractive, and it's not the end of the world. This is more just something out of my chest because I'm a bit tired of liking men because they don't require effort, they just give you a lot of headaches.",1,1735833054.0,askgaybros,0,1.0,False

No answer. So I told him that I'm allergic to his animal and to move back. He said that it's hypoallergenic, so I got a bit annoyed and raised my voice when I responded ""NO. It's not. Every one of your type says that.""

**The Room**

He hardly comes in here. Too cold, too distant. Too haunted, *as if there were just the right amount.* The neglect shows. He has a couple of shots of Jack in one hand, another couple on board. In the living room, ""The Silence"" by Manchester Orchestra plays softly, its haunting melody curling around the edges of the room. The lyrics claw at the quiet corners of his heart, stirring a familiar ache—a longing, a grief for something just out of reach. Andy Hull's voice rises and falls, painting vivid pictures of isolation and loss, as if he were singing directly to the room and its ghosts.

*Why do I deserve the science to feel better about you?* The question cuts through him, echoing his own doubts. The song continues, relentless in its intimacy, as though peeling back layers he’s tried so hard to ignore.

*But you, amplified in the silenceJustified in the way you make me bruiseMagnified in the scienceAnatomically proved that you don't need me.*

He leans back, feeling the weight of her absence settle over him like the chill in the air. It wasn’t all his fault, he thinks, though the doubt gnaws at him. They had filled this room with intimacy and shared secrets, but the years collapsed into months, collapsed into week-long vignettes that weren’t enough to keep it inhabited. Storms battered the clapboard sides, forcing a slow then hasty retreat. The storm howled like a battle cry, and in its wake, the sounding of the retreat. Does it matter whose lips were on the bugle?

*""I wasn’t enough, I wasn’t enough,”* Hull’s voice crescendos, and he feels the truth hit with the weight of a long-ignored confession.

His breath fogs in the cold air, and he shakes his head. ""No,"" he murmurs, as if convincing himself. ""No, we both let it happen."" There’s an odd comfort in the thought—a shared burden, even in absence. A memory of her voice rises unbidden, sharp yet familiar: *""We’re good at breaking things, you and me.""* He smiles bitterly. At least they’d been a team, even in that.

*If you knew I was dying, would it change you?* This line catches him off guard, striking a nerve so deep he feels his breath falter. What if she were dying? Pots, kettle, and black. ""I'd be changed for sure,"" he mutters, ""I'm pre-unrecognizable watching it happen, reading the snippets of data, as objective as notes passed in class."" The song lifts him into its current.

He pictures her here, the absence of her energy chilling the room beyond its meteorological destiny. He doesn't allow himself to imagine her persisting too much. He'd once pulled out a stitch in a wound on his arm. He can’t remember the name of the  kid that hit him with a homemade arrow. He told his parents it was in his sleep, but it was his curiosity. He doesn’t do that anymore. Now he wills wounds to heal as if dermis and epidermis understand intent. He absent mindedly picks at the scar on his forearm.  No, she needed to leave this room.

The final notes linger, suspended in the air like a held breath. The room was waiting for something, he thought, noticing the broken clock on the wall. ""Well, aren’t we all?"" For a moment, the stillness is absolute.

And then, he begins to write.

**The Room**

The three-season room is too cold. The old-growth flooring is buckled; there is this nail that keeps catching the soles of my shoes. In warmer times, it caused us pain, but I wear shoes now. I should have set it in place then, but neither of us could be bothered. The occasional ""fuck"" as steel met skin was no match for you, your legs impossibly tucked under you, like a magic trick absorbing all my attention. Coffee in one hand, a Virginia Slim sitting precariously on the edge of ash.

I remember your face. Sometimes it's almost all I remember. Enough.

Outside, the wind is blowing, sending missives from the late fall. The transition teams are working together on the details of the next administration, this one recalled. A dusty wine glass is on the floor, hiding just out of reach of the Goodwill couch. I wonder if your DNA survived the winters on a lipstick smear.

The five-dollar IKEA clock stopped at 12-something indeterminate. Could be 40, could be a little less. The walls have suffered too. Latex against cold—not a knockout to be sure. Perhaps they are waiting for the clock to work before calling the round.

I marvel at how comfortable I am in the post-apocalypse. I should probably clean up the place, knock that nail in. I resolve to not resolve.

i work at a coffee shop and i would like to keep track of the drinks i make (along with what kind of milk i used, if it was to sit here or to take away, etc). the spread sheet would just be for my personal enjoyment and not for any kind of marketing or anything of the kind, i just want to see what drinks i make the most, along with the stats and numbers. i was wondering how to tackle this, and how to arrange it so i get graphs. i hope everything makes sense to you guys, and i would appreciate any help and tips !!

the picture below shows what i have so far (i have very little idea what im doing), and ideally i would like to see a graph with time of year / date, drink type and milk used, along with if it was sit here or take away, and with extra (or if thats too many things, which drink i made and what type of milk was used would be already good)  
the idea would basically be to have a ""coffee drinks order wrapped"" type deal so i can look back at which drink was the most popular etc

i hope everything makes sense to you guys, and that my dream is achievable !!

1hrwk13,https://www.reddit.com/r/askswitzerland/comments/1hrwk13/opinion_about_my_friends/,Opinion about my friends ,"Hi, if it matters, I'm male, swiss, 33, quite ordinary, so no known superpowers etc. What happened is that we planned with most of my closest friends from around Switzerland to celebrate the new year in a fancy chalet above Lenk. In the end, I was feeling unwell health-wise (not sick), and had to stay alone at home. Notably, most people traveled by cars, and it would have taken them a mere 15-minute detour, if they visited me to say hi and give some cheer up. But it didn't happen, and no one even offered it on their way back on Jan 1st, even though we were texting and I clearly stated that I felt quite lonely... Also, I hadn't seen many of them since a couple of months (busy work and the different cities don't help). 

Anyway, I convinced myself not to spend too many thoughts on this. And just proceeded with some random activities, e.g. like in the last few days just scrolling even more banana lengths in reddit. But oddly enough, this weirdness continued on the next day... 

So today, I was texting about the last few days with another really close friend of mine, and he mentioned he will be using gifted daily travel cards with another friend today for some sightseeing, and since they will be passing through Thun, he suggested I could join them for a walk. I actually didn't want to get out in the windy and rainy weather, but told them they could come over for some tea or coffee (I literally live in the city center). In response, I got a ""nah, no problem. They are feeling tired already, so probably they will not have time."" 

Anyway, I have partial understanding for their reasoning (e.g. we want to sightsee, have better stuff to do), but i'm also upset and not understanding it fully. That is why I wanted to get your opinions on this. Like, couldn't any of them imagine that spending these days alone at home feels not that super great and that maybe they could do something about it or at least ask?

To give you an idea of my thinking, if someone told me they feel lonely and will be staying at home, I would feel almost obliged to ask if I could do anything or pass by to see them (maybe even for a stranger, but definitely for all my the friends, which obviously aren't too many).  

PS: Please let me know if I should change anything or delete my question, I'm still new here. ",4,1735832606.0,askswitzerland,0,0.75,False

The Crown poker room is the only business that I have known that doesn't like to be busy. When they think it will be busy they close the room totally like on Boxing Day. Boxing day used to be their biggest trading day. When the room gets too busy they also cancel a game that is running, like today I waiting 3-4 hours for my $2/$3 poker seat and because too many people were on the list they just cancelled the whole game without letting people on the list know.

The minimum for normal blackjack is $100. That is way too expensive for the average working Australian.

They have closed all the good value restaurants and replaced them with nothing. You can't buy any proper food from Margo's anymore. They don't even give you a free tea, coffee or soft drink in the riverside room anymore.

Hello there! 

I’m 24, and I moved to London a few years ago. I have grown up playing cribbage in the states and miss playing it against an actual opponent. I haven’t had the pleasure of playing in many years now, and I’d like to rectify that. 

If you’re someone who lives in London and would like to play a few games of cribbage in person and grab some coffee or a beer, I’d be extremely pleased. I’m a decent conversationalist and I’m caught up on some of the main shows that are running at the moment. I’m sure we wouldn’t run out of things to talk about. I don’t mind someone older, you don’t need to be around my age. Just someone nice who enjoys playing the game.

1hrwgih,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1hrwgih/another_big_zoologist_review/,Another BIG Zoologist review,"These are my very personal, subjective experiences and I tried to leave most of the ‘official’ notes and descriptions out (as they’re easy to find) and keep my reviews as short and associative as possible. For me it always helps to have a description of the ‘colour’ of a fragrance (associative, not the actual colour of the liquid) to help me imagine what it smells like, so I left them in.

Sorry it got so long! I’d love to hear what you think of these fragrances!

BAT - Bright green and beige -

I was really looking forward to trying this one because I was so interested in the notes, but have to admit I was a bit disappointed when I did. The opening has a sharp green with a very faint animalic hint. I don’t get any sweetness from the guave or fig - if any fruit, maybe the acidity of a green apple? The dry down is a bit more interesting with some earthy, beetroot type smell and some hay, but this is when the scent already starts fading. Much more subtle and lighter than the damp, musky, fruity bomb I was expecting. Tried Bat a few times because I really wanna like it, but it’s just not doing much and wears off so quickly. My bf felt the same, so maybe there’s something wrong with the sample we got? 6/10

BEAVER - Light blue-green -

This smell intrigued me from the start and I keep going back to it. There are some animalic notes in the opening, very quickly accompanied by some very fresh and clean aquatic and light woody notes - which provides an interesting balance. Apart maybe from festive December winter, this could be an all year rounder. 8,5/10

BEE - Warm Yellow -

Very sweet and just a lot of honey, obviously. I wasn’t expecting to like this one at all based on the notes, but it’s actually a bit less unpleasant than I was dreading. The lighter flowers balance out the thick honey quite well, but it’s still very sweet and sticky. Will never be my favourite, but I struggle to fully experience such a sweet and floral scent in the winter, so will give this another try in Summer. 5/10

CAMEL - Warm brown -

Quite a forgettable oriental scent to me. Probably doesn’t help that this doesn’t work well on my skin. I mainly get amber and incense and probably wouldn’t recognise it if I smelled it again. 5/10

CHAMELEON - Yellow -

Not sure what to think of the opening, as it seems to go all over the place, but not in a bad way. Feels like I have to chew on some harsh fruits first, before I get to the more pleasant dry down with softer textured notes like cashmere, vanilla and musk. It ticks all the boxes for a tropical summer scent with some sea salt and coconut and a lot of juicy mango. Too sweet and fruity for me and just not a profile that I’d go for, but I think i’s great if you’re looking for a tropical summer scent. 7/10

CHIPMUNK - Hazel brown -

The scent itself is just what I was hoping it to be! Woody, nutty, with earthy notes that balance out the slight sweetness very well. Very friendly and pleasant. Perfect for autumn, winter and even Christmas. If only it would last longer! Both the projection and longevity are quite weak. It’s such a light and subtle skin scent that when I spray it on my wrists before going for a walk it’s literally gone with the wind. Considering a full bottle because I love the cosy hazelnut with warm benzoin and comforting cedar, but I’d probably use up the bottle within a few weeks.  9/10
Reminds me of: Replica - Autumn Vibes

CIVET - Cognac -

The opening is magical! Fresh greenery and warm woodiness with a splash of juicy orange and a dash of spicy pepper. Something boozy as well. Once it starts melting into the skin, it looses its magic a bit, but this is one of those ones that goes a bit off on my skin and holds up nicer on my bf’s skin. Dark and rich without being too heavy. I would love the coffee note to be just a bit more prominent. 7,5/10
Reminds me of: Lush - Lord of misrule

COCKATIEL - Pink -

Dust, acidic raspberry and something tingly. The opening is quite harsh and unpleasant and I’m not sure what to think of it. Smells like it’s starting to come together after 30 minutes or so. Then it’s not that bad of a powdery, musky scent with some sweet fruits and a little fizz/tingle. 6,5/10

DODO - Green -

This takes me on a journey as soon as I spray it on. The opening is quite animalic, like walking around a zoo or animal farm. Only takes a few minutes before different green notes like firn and lime freshen it up and then something very juicy and fruity (raspberry?) joins in. After about 30 minutes it has gone from poopy zoo to fresh green jungle to quite a tropical beach scent that’s very enjoyable. The dry down is pretty much like a perfect petrichor scent to me, very pleasantly ‘damp from rain’. Can’t wait to try this again in spring! 9/10

DODO JACKFRUIT - Green -

When me and my bf first smelled this, we were looking at each other quite confused while he said ‘floor cleaner’ at the same time I said ‘window cleaner’. I was expecting some notes from the ‘normal’ Dodo with an addition of jackfruit, but this smells nothing like Dodo and all I can smell is bergamot and lavender cleaning product. I don’t particularly mind that smell, but don’t really wanna smell like it. 7/10

ELEPHANT - Mahogany -

This one is hard to describe. I love how it’s very lush, green and grassy and at the same time very dark and dry. I think the dryness comes from the cacao. It’s like crunching on dark cacao nibs. It’s very unusual and nothing like I’ve smelled before. It’s like too separate tracks that should never get mixed, but alongside each other they somehow work like a perfect pairing. Will try this one a bit more in Summer. 8,5/10

HARVEST MOUSE - Barley -

I usually don’t like gourmands at all but this little mouse is irresistible. There’s definitely vanilla (which I’m normally not a fan of), but it’s a very soft and quiet vanilla. It’s cosy like an English pub where the wooden tables are sticky from the beer, cider and wine. I also get rye bread, log cabin and a little red berry - which is not in the notes, just my imagination. If I smell my wrist too often, it makes me a bit nauseous (which every gourmand does to me), but it stays so close to the skin that I can easily take a little break from it. This might be the perfect Christmas scent! 9,5/10
Reminds me of: Etat Libre d'Orange - Story Of Your Life

NIGHTINGALE - Lilac -

This is the first one that made me pull my head away in pure horror as soon as I smelled my wrist. I would be very happy to never smell this again in my life. It’s like old powdery make up that’s gone rancid, or a stinky dressing room with nylon wigs and sweaty costumes that have never been washed piled up in it. 
It must be a particular note that I’m sensitive to, because I’ve smelled this note before on a scented doll when I was a child and once again on lip balm that I thought had gone bad, where it’s actually meant to smell that way, but my nose picks up on something bad. I picked up the note in Hummingbird as well and I’m suspecting it’s either plum or something like iris or lilac, but I’m not sure. If any of you can help me identify this note, I would highly appreciate it! 1/10

HUMMINGBIRD - Pink and green -

I mainly get honeysuckle from the opening before some tropical and green notes come in. Strangely enough I didn’t mind it as much the first time I sprayed it on, but was put off the second and third time I tested it. This is when I got the same horrible powdery note (but less extreme) as I got from Nightingale. I’m guessing it must be the plum? 3/10

HYRAX - Brown -

The opening is animalic, with quite a bit of sweaty hay. It quickly turns into a nice dry leathery, woody scent that works particularly well on my bf’s skin. Very nice blend with some warm amber, fresh florals and sweet tonka bean. Just a pleasant, well balanced scent but not something I get super excited about. 7,5/10

KING COBRA - Green -

Love at first whiff! Starts off very green, herbal and earthy. Green leaves, damp soil and a bit of cannabis. I keep smelling my wrist when testing this. Blends very well with my skin and actually turns into a very comforting clean scent, which will be perfect for spring and summer. 9,5/10

KOALA - Grey-green -

A perfect scent that is just so clean and cosy and nice and fuzzy. From the eucalyptus opening to the pine wood dry down, this is just very pleasant and friendly. It’s like the dry, warmed up pine wood in a sauna. It’s just so incredibly light and disappears very quickly. Maybe a full bottle with a nice big spray would work better than a little sample atomizer, but the poor projection and longevity prevents me from getting a bottle at the moment. 9/10

MACAQUE YUZU - Green -

Animalic and fruity with a clean, musk dry down. It’s pleasant but after trying so many more interesting Zoologist fragrances, it doesn’t do that much at the moment. Will have to try this a bit more to see if I can get a more into it. 7,5/10

MOTH - Warm grey -

This one is intriguing. The opening is very nice with some spices and florals, but it gets harder and harder to grasp what I’m actually smelling. Definitely some sweet and smokey incense, but cool and light instead of warm. Quite a good impression of a fluttering moth that you can’t quite catch. Takes a while to dry down, but when it does there’s a honey note that comes in that unfortunately makes this go rancid on my skin. 6,5/10

NORTHERN CARDINAL - Dark green -

An instant favourite! What a lovely green, earthy, comforting scent! I guess the structure is quite classic with a fresh and uplifting opening with some citrus notes, a smooth middle with clary sage and leather and a warm base of oak moss and musk. Foliage, soil and moss, just like being in a wet forest in autumn when the rain has just stopped. Blends with the skin like velvet, an absolute winner! 10/10

PANDA - Light green - 

Not unpleasant but nothing special either. It’s definitely fresh and green (bamboo, lemon, green leaves), but there’s a sharp note that just won’t settle on my skin and it reminds me of being stuck in a lift with a lady covered in hairspray. 5/10

PENGUIN - Light grey -

The first association when smelling Penguin is ‘new car’. Rubbery, leathery, a bit musky and slightly masculine. I love juniper berry and it really helps creating an icy feel. The dry down smells very similar to the opening and everything that happens in between, it’s very linear. Pleasant, friendly and not a heavy winter fragrance. I’s very soft and I think it might even work as a fresh scent to cool off with on warm summer days. 9/10

RABBIT - Orange -

This one screams NO to me. I don’t like gourmands and this is unmistakably a gourmand that confirms I don’t like them. I was hoping the carrot, green leaves and apple notes might freshen it up enough, but this is just very sweet, sticky, nauseating and artificial smelling to me. 1/10

RHINOCEROS - Brown - 

Animalic, dark chocolate and leather. Like Elephants darker, drier brother. There’s something a bit unpleasant or unbalanced about it. I was expecting much more booze and other warm and rich notes, but it dries down as very dry hay, almost like chamomile. Not a fan 3/10

SACRAD SCARAB - Gold -

Opens with fresh floral notes, probably mainly lotus. After a few minutes something smokey joins in that, combined with the florals, creates a rich incense accord. It’s very oriental and luxurious smelling, but not dark and heavy, it strays quite fresh. Also a bit generic, like the blend coming from perfume shops at the airport. It’s something you would smell on a woman who’s well off and wears fancy clothes and expensive jewelries. It’s probably not something I would choose to wear, but maybe for something very dressed up on a warm Summer evening. 6/10

SNOWY OWL - Ligt green and white -

Lovely light, fresh, unique scent. It immediately takes me to a pleasantly cold and quiet place. Like a snowy landscape, very still and serene. A perfect scent to clear your head with. It’s not just ice cold and reminds me more of the end of winter, when the snow begins to melt and some new, fresh green is starting to take over. I don’t think there’s a mistletoe note in this, but that’s what I get from it. The coconut in it is very subtle, not the super sweet type but almost natural smelling. Got a full bottle for Christmas and I keep looking forward to wearing this! 9,5/10
Reminds me of: Library of Fragrance/Demeter - Mistletoe

SQUID - Black - 

This is a weird one. When I first smelled it, I was very intrigued and couldn’t stop sniffing my wrist. That first splash of pink pepper, the salt, the ink, the ambergris and smoky incense.. It was one of the first Zoologist fragrances I ever smelled and it immediately made me wanna get more samples of the other ones. Something weird happened though. After smelling other Zoologist samples and coming back to Squid, it got a bit unpleasant. Maybe I sniffed it too much, but I got nauseous and got a headache and couldn’t help but perceiving it as a caramel & sea-salt (a combo I very much dislike) type of smell. Since then I’m not sure about Squid anymore. Now it mainly gives me very accurate notes of pencil shavings and lead with some caramel & sea-salt and I’m just not a fan of that at all. I wish I could go back to that first day I smelled this! 5/0

SEAHORSE - Light blue-green -

Another great one from the start! Seaweed, neroli and ambergris make this a great, summery marine scent that’s perfect for sunlit beach days. The fennel, cardamom and clary sage add some green and herbal notes, so I’m suspecting this will work very well in spring too. Very pleasant and smooth dry down with the musk and sage standing out. 9/10

SLOTH - Kahki -

This reminds me a lot of herbal tea with chamomile, lavender and anise. Dries down into a soft and smooth herbal bedtime scent. Not really my thing at the moment, but well balanced and represents the sleepy sloth very well! 7/10
Reminds me of: Lush - Smell of the weather turning

T-REX - Dark grey -

Bracing myself when trying this after everything I heard about it, but I don’t find it scary or intimidating at all. It turns out to be a pleasant floral incense scent. I do recognise that burning tire smell in the very opening, but it dries down pretty quickly and is so much more floral and fresh than I was expecting. Rose, jasmine, patchouli, geranium and a smokey incense note, that rather than ‘warm’ smokey is much more ‘cold’ smokey - like cold ash in a fireplace that hasn’t been used for a while. Good outdoorsy ‘summer evening by the campfire’ smell. 8,5/10

TIGER - Bright green -

I get a little bit of the carrot seeds when spraying this, but I mainly get vetiver, maybe with some suede or leather in the dry down. The sharp vetiver feels quite overpowering and my untrained nose doesn’t pick up on much else once it settles. 4/10

To be fully honest, we probably haven’t cleaned it enough or descaled it enough. The light has been flashing and I’m thinking it might be caused by its need to be descaled. I’ve looked up videos and the instruction manual and can’t seem to make it work. 

If I try to follow the PDF of the user manual for the Vertuo machine, when I hold the button for 7 seconds, the light shuts off after approximately 4/5 seconds and then simply doesn’t light up again. The manual states it should shut, then start flashing rapidly, which it doesn’t do. I’ve tried holding it longer amount of times, shorter, 7 seconds exactly but nothing seems to work. 

We’ve managed to start the cleaning process by pressing it 3 times in a row rapidly, but that’s about it. The light still blinks three times and then stays on for a second.

1hrwdum,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hrwdum/just_got_rejected/,Just got rejected,"im mainly making this post in the hopes of finding a way to deal with this pain because it's unbearable. I've tried talking about it to a friend but I hate doing it because 1) I feel pathetic talking about this with her and 2) I hate feeling like Im wasting her time. 

Context: I 24M have been going on lunch/coffee dates(I'm not sure if it's considered a date) with a girl (22F) from work for about 3 months now. I try to plan atleast one every week and we've been getting pretty close. Each time we go out I get even more attached and find more common things between us. There were days where I just couldn't get her out of my head and so since I couldn't take it anymore I decided to tell her how I felt after our lunch today. I felt like it was the perfect time because we really had a great time together. So I asked her to go on a walk with me and I just tried to be completely honest about how I felt but before I could say much she just stopped me and told me ""it's not you it's just that I've never dated anyone because my religion doesn't allow that and not only that but my parents are sure strict about this sort of thing"". I have heard about her religion having such strict rules so I'm inclined to believe her. She was supportive about me deciding to withdraw from now on, I guess she understood why I wanted to do it.

It's just that even though I knew it would fail I just can't seem to accept it because for the first time in my life I actually felt a genuine connection with someone and for it to fail is just too much for me. The worst part of it all is that there's nothing going well for me in life

No growth at work, barely talk to friends(those tht are left) and now constantly fail in the romantic situations.

What should I do to deal with the pain because all I can think about is how much time I've lost thinking about her and how I'm probably never gonna trust any hint of interest from a woman.

Tari and Rufus are taking a seat alongside Ragatha and Kinger as a noticeably bemused blonde girl comes up to their table. Her cheerful voice sounded much too forced to be genuine. 

Lizzy: Hello. Welcome to Spudsy's. May I take your order?

Tari: One Veggie Burger, please. 

Rufus: Bangers n' Mash with a side of slaw. 

Ragatha: I'll have the kosher style double hotdog with a milkshake.

Kinger: One grilled cheese, Please. 

Lizzy: Alrighty! 

Lizzy keeps up the smiles as she writes down their orders, and immediately drops the act when she's far enough away. She heads over to the front desk and hands the order over to a chill green eyed lad beside the cash register. She pulls out her phone and pulls up her Tumblr. 

Lizzy: Four orders for table three. 

Thad: Gotcha. Four more coming up, Ellis!....... Ellis?

He heads into the kitchen and finds a man-shaped mass of orbs manning the fryers.

Thad: Yo, Orbsman. You seen Ellis? 

Orbsman: [HE SAID HE HEARD SOMETHING IN THE BACK ROOM AND WENT TO TAKE A LOOK.]

Thad: Well, could you take over for a sec? We got 4 more orders.

Orbsman: [WILL DO, SIR.]

The ring of a bell signals two new customers, Uzi and Noah, come inside. Kinger is the first to notice.

Noah: Hey Kinger! 

Kinger: Oh! Fancy seeing you guys here.

Uzi just casually smirks as the two make their way to an adjacent table. That's when Tari notices a familiar white suited gentleman come in, accompanied by another familiar young man. She immediately recognized them both.

Tari: *gasp* PIETRO! DAMIEN!

Damien glances over to the blue haired girl shouting his name and eagerly waving at him. She hops out of her seat and hurriedly runs up to him, much to his confusion.

Damien: Oh......um, hey there!

Tari: It's great to see you again, Damien. You too, Pietro!

It took a moment to click for him. 

That's when it clicks.

Pietro: Oh. One of Damien's friends. 

Tari: Yes! We met on that cave expedition. The one with-

A leather glove swiftly clasps itself over her mouth. He speaks to her with a hushed tone.

Pietro: Yes. The one with the ruins.

He takes a quick look around. 

Pietro: No need to let EVERYONE know. Understood?

Tari nods, and Pietro retracts his hand. 

Tari: Sorry about that. It's just...... it's been a while and I was wondering what you've been up to.

Damien: Well, there isn't much on my end. Apart from the appointments, I've just been laying low and taking it easy.

Tari: That's great to hear. I'm glad you're doing well. 

Damien: As well as I can be

Tari: What about you, Pietro? Been doing anything super sneaky lately. 

Pietro: I'd tell you, but then I'd have to kill you. 

Tari gives a little chuckle at his ""joke."" Lizzy puts on another fake smile as Pietro approaches the register. 

Lizzy: Hello, sir. Is there anything you would like to order?

Pietro: Just a coffee, light on cream. Bill it to- 

A blood curdling scream echoes from the back of the building. Tari and the others fall dead silent. Even Lizzy was somewhat surprised.

Lizzy: *sigh* Excuse me for a minute. Orbsman will arrive with your orders shortly. 

She ushers everybody back to their seats before rushing off towards the back of the building. She finds Thad with his hand on his chest and his back against the wall with the look of sheer dread on his face. 

Lizzy: Let me guess. Another spider? 

Back in the dining area, Uzi nonchalantly browses the menu while Noah tries to strike up a conversation with Pietro across the table. Damien is just staring out the window. 

Noah: So there are these symbols you'll encounter as you go through the dungeon. The symbols stay the same with each reset, so it's good to have it written down for future runs. 

Pietro: (Mon dieu, is he still going?) 

Tari and the others meanwhile are enjoying their food and striking up a conversation of their own.

Ragatha: So Tari, I heard you were invited to a friend's family reunion. 

Tari: Not exactly. There was this huge misunderstanding and we more or less ended up......... breaking into their house. Don't worry! Things got sorted out pretty quickly, though.

Rufus: Y'know, that reminds me of a time me and my parents snuck into a party once. Heh......  Turned out to be a funeral. My dad had to make up this story about how he and the guy served in the army so we wouldn't get arrested. 

That's when Tari notices something going on in the kitchen. Thad sifts past the frycooks with the look of sheer dread on his face as he returns to his station behind the register. Lizzy isn't too far behind. 

Lizzy: Just suck it up and make the announcement already.

He lightly taps the microphone. The high pitched squeek rings out from speakers across the building. 

Thad: Uh, attention all customers and staff. Within one hour, we will be closing the main dining area for cleaning and maintenance. Future orders will need to be made at the drive through, and alll current in-progress orders will be labeled as ""to go"" at no additional charge and will include a free Kid's Toy. Thank you for eating at Spudsy's, and we hope to see you again soon. 

Noah: *GASP* I didn't know they had kids toys! 

Uzi: But you're not even a kid.

Noah: Oh yeah. Maybe I can ask for an adult toy instead? 

The comment got a chuckle out of Damien and nearly made Pietro choke on his coffee. Tari wasn't laughing. She could feel something wasn't right. Ragatha had the same feeling, and even Kinger was a bit off-put by the announcement. Out back, a bemused Lizzy watches a frantic Thad pace back and forth in a panic. 

Thad: Okay. This.......this is really bad. Really. Really. REALLY bad. I don't know about you, but I did NOT sign up for this! I'M FREAKING OUT, MAN!

She gives him a slap across the face.

Lizzy: Get a hold of yourself, you dunce! Panicking isn't gonna fix anything. 

Thad: We need to call the cops. 

Lizzy: And have them close down the only job we could find in this dump? 

Thad: THEN WHAT THE HELL ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO!?

Lizzy: Quiet! The last thing we need is people overhearing this! 

Thad: Right!..... Sorry. 

Lizzy: *sigh* Look. Here's what we're gonna do. You simply just man the drive thru and give us cover while I go grab the manager. Absolutely NO ONE is to suspect anything wrong.

Kinger: Why not? 

The two jump at the sight of Kinger just standing there beside them.

Lizzy: Excuse me, what the hell are you doing here!?

Kinger: I heard you guys from upfront. It sounded like you two need a little help.

Lizzy: THAT'S COMPANY BUSINESS, NOW SCRAM!

Lizzy acts fast as she pushes Thad towards the backdoor. Ragatha and Tari arrive just as Lizzy slams the door behind her, followed by the clicks of various locks and pins to make sure it STAYS shut. 

Tari: Huh....... I wonder what that was all about. 

Ragatha: Yeah, me too. 

Back inside, Lizzy shoves Thad over to the Drive Thru window as she makes her way into the main office. A middle aged man sits behind the desk with a glass of Jack Daniel's in his hand.

Nick: Let me guess. Someone threw Harry into the deep-fryer again?

Lizzy: Ellis is dead.

Nick: What do you mean he's dead? Did he fall down and crack his head open or what? 

Lizzy: I MEAN Thad found a fresh pile of mincemeat with Ellis's name tag on it. 

She proceeds to pull out said nametag, freshly caked in blood, and tosses it onto the desk. That's when Nick starts taking this seriously.

Nick: S***........ did you clear out the dining hall?

Lizzy: Yep. And I have Thad covering for us on drive thru duty. 

Nick: *sigh*

He opens a drawer and pulls out a gold plated Desert Eagle, along with a fresh magazine.

Nick: Alright, let's have a look.

Maybe a couple of weeks later, we were at a bar again and at the end of the night, he asked me to grab him a glass of water from the bar. The bar was packed and it took a minute to be served. I was leaned over the bar and ended up talking to another patron again, but I figured it was fine because I was waiting to grab him water that I guess he didn't want to get up to get. When I got back, he made it very clear that he considered this the same offense and further accused me of shaking my ass for the sexual attention of the man next to me. We had both had a few drinks so I'm not really sure what he was perceiving and what happened next kind of made me blank on what happened at all. As we were walking home, he continued on about me shaking my ass for that guy, and I told him if I was shaking my ass it would've been for him behind me. He ended up grabbing me by the ear and I lost a couple of earrings. We both went back to my apartment where he called me a whore and yelled at me and left. 

A couple of weeks after that, we were in bed and I asked him if I could talk to him about it. I thought we had spent the past weeks thoroughly covering my behavior, so I brought up that I really didn't like being called a whore. I didn't even bring up the rest. He became extremely defensive, ultimately screaming in my face. I'll admit, I slapped him here. He left. 

Things were fine with minor upsets for a while. He had been staying with me for about a month and we took a trip. I planned and coordinated the whole thing because I had been to the city prior. Just about every step of the way, something went wrong but we were fine. Once checked into the hotel and receiving the item we were in the city to receive, we decided to grab dinner. We went to a restaurant around the corner and I thought we were lucky to grab a seat at the bar, as the restaurant was packed and this was a Friday night, downtown in a major city, on a holiday weekend. I told him I would cover dinner and he could get lunch tomorrow because there was a $20 cocktail I wanted to order and I didn't think it would be fair for him to cover that when he was just going to order a cheap drink.

The bartender told us that it would be around a 40 minute wait for food. He indicated that he was too hungry and so we packed up and left. We passed a convenience store and I suggested he grab something to hold him over since he has a big appetite. I was gettint pretty hungry and a little frustrated but I knew if I ate anything, it would ruin my dinner. So he does and we walk around looking for another restaurant. At some point, after dome failure, I know I'm becoming short, and I apologized for it, let him know I was just hungry and tired, and there was a fine place close to where we were that we could go to. 

When we get there, there's about 20 people up front waiting for a table. I go up to the host stand to see about bar seating and gesture for him to follow me. He doesn't, but I continue to the bar anyway to grab an empty seat and immediately text him directions. When he rounds the corner, I wave so he can see me. At this point, I also have to pee, so when he sits down I tell him that and he grabs my jacket and says something about respecting him. When I get back, he insists on paying, which I guess I just should've let him do, but at this place, I was aiming for a higher price entre and I told him I would take care of it. He very much didn't like that. He would claim sometimes that I used money as a means of domination or control, but this was his primary example and I'm really just not sure. 

After dinner, we go back to the hotel, and I told him I want to sit in the lobby for a second and just take a breather alone because I'm feeling very weird and bad about everything. When I go back up, we talk a little and it seems like we're good but at this point I'm so exhausted and in a negative mood that we call it for the evening. We go to take a shower together but the hotel shower is frustrating me so I get out sooner. Ultimately we're in bed and I'm feeling so defeated and I say something like, ""sometimes the way you talk to me makes me feel like shit."" 

There was probably a better way to communicate my feelings because this pissed him off. We ended up sitting up for maybe the next six hours while he unloaded his grievances on me and I mostly stared at the wall. I ended up moving our tickets home up to earlier in the day and we leave, him completely shut off but insisting that we sit together on the train still. 

We get back to my place and he packs up and leaves. 

Another couple of weeks later, he's staying at mine again. He does something like asking permission to do something mundane in my apartment and I tell him it's fine and when we're all settled, I try to have a conversation, because one of the things he brought up the night we were out of town is that he felt that he was always in my way and I'm immoveable. I thought maybe he didn't feel comfortable bringing up these feelings with me, so I asked about it. He became defensive, probably because of the previous fight, and the whole night went sour but we talked it through the next morning. 

During that conversation, I ended up crying. I admit that I'm quick to cry, but I told him to ignore it. He told me that someone who is so emotional is not the strong woman he thought I was and that it was changing his perspective of me. That hurt, but I brushed over it. We ended up being okay. 

A couple of weeks later, he was here and I was working from home. I was busy with work and had a couple of errands to run so I was a little frazzled, but I talked him and even waited for him to get out of the bathroom before I left the house at one point so he knew I was leaving for a bit. He said I'd been mad at him all morning and I explained that wasn't the case, I was just busy. He ended up being distant the rest of the day and ultimately I did end up feeling bad and ultimately got a little fixated on the prior crying comment. I ended up going to bed early and he joined me upstairs to say goodnight. I wasn't in the mood for sex and it seemed like he left as soon as I communicated that. I texted him ""sorry for being a bummer,"" and he responded, ""sorry if I did anything."" I thought for a while, relaxed, and got over the crying comment, deciding it wasn't worth bringing up and was in a good mood the next day and so was he. 

The next day was fine until it wasn't. At night, we were settling in and he made a comment, which is a frequent one, about something about the tidiness of my apartment. I paused what we were watching and asked him to talk to me about it, whether there were things I could be doing differently. This fight got really bad. I don't even know how it escalated, but at some point he kept insisting on me always being against him and talking over me and I hit the coffee table out of frustration, which I felt terrible about. He called me crazy but let me talk for a while but I said something that set him off. He grabbed a handful of a slice of cake on the table and then grabbed my hair. I cleaned it up while he washed his hands and told him I would be upstairs. After a while, I asked if we could talk again, or just sit together for a second and he texted back that he thinks that we're going to break up. I ended up going downstairs even though I know I should've given him space. I tried to explain why I brought up that issue again and it wasn't productive so I started to go upstairs. He ended up grabbing me by my shirt collar twice, so hard that it ripped. That freaked me out and I ran upstairs. 

I said something I really regret, something like, ""that was really not ok, I could call the cops for that."" I know that that was an inappropriate threat but I was scared and I thought that would make him stop lashing out. He ended up coming upstairs to pack his things to leave. He told me he needed a month, but he always goes back and forth on whether he's broken up with me or he needs time. 

Anyway, he left, and two days later, I texted asking if he wanted me to drop off some of the things he left because he told me before he left that he'd like me to do that. He never responded. 

On New Year's Eve, three or so days later, I tried calling him a couple of times and didn't get an answer which I know was a little crazy on my part. He texted me last night that we're done and to never speak to him again. 

I know that some of his actions bled into ""unacceptable"" territory, but he always said to me, especially when I tried to bring it up that it was just reactions to my actions. I know that doesn't justify the scale or execution of the reaction, but I'm trying really hard to identify places where I might have been controlling (like with the paying for dinner) or manipulative. He didn't like when I would bring things up, saying that I just wanted to be sad or that they were his issues and he would let me know if they needed to be discussed. I'm not sure if I was being manipulative or maybe if I did just want to be sad (a form of manipulation) and that's why I would bring them up. I've never been clear about the talking to other bar patrons thing, but I stopped doing it. 

I know he's not a bad person, and I'll always have a lot of love for him but I'm not sure how to move on without knowing whether I caused him to act this way and I'm not sure how to figure that out.

I confessed my feelings sa pangalawang taong nagpatibok ng puso ko, for almost 3 yrs na hindi ako nag-mahal, ngayon nabuksan ulit. I didn't expect that I will develop such feelings toward sa taong to. Idk, it's just that indescribable masyado, when he first arrived sa workplace I find him so attractive pero hanggang dyan lang. Unfortunately he was given a load subject na hindi nya expertise and that became the bridge to our interactions. 

One random day, we chatted and I sent him a picture of my cat and boom! After that conversation I found out na he's also animal lover and discovered how kind he is to stray animals like dogs and cats. Days, weeks have passed I figured na inlove na talaga ako, how can I say? Alam nyo yung feeling na parang description ng stories in Wattpad na kapag nag-uusap kayo, di mo namamalayan sa mata ka nalang nya naka tingin, nakangiti, and parang kayo lang dalawa ang naiwang tao sa mundo. Call it corny, pero promise that's what happened. 

Fst forward, in a short span of time, the scariest day na ayaw kong mangyari is mangyayari na, he decided to resign. When I heard the news, my heart was crumbled and I need to make a move dahil konti nalang oras naiiwan. I have to confess my feelings. A day before his last day, nag absent ako sa work just to finish a scrapbook as my parting gift and confession na rin (there's a secret compartment sa scrapbook where I insert my letter). 

Now, the day has finally come, my heart is so nervous kung ibibigay ko ba sya directly o hindi, pero sa kaba ko na baka maiyak ako di ko ginawa and I ended up leaving the gift hanging on his bicycle sa parking lot. I rushed my way to my last class, and the entire period I've been waiting and watching out for him sa may bintana sa fourth floor classroom. He was so clueless as he saw the gift bag he partly opened the gift and departed. After the class I went straight to the comfort room and cried. And na realize ko na walang pangalan ang gift kung kanino sya galing 😭😭😭😭 pero alam nyo yun na si Lord is so good, dahil may isang picture ako nilagay sa confession letter na stolen picture of him mula sa kinauupuan ko na angle, which made him realize na ako daw ang nagbigay. 

Fst forward, our communication after his departure is on and off, and I understand him because of his new transition. Before the month of December end like mid. I had this conversation with my workmate, and he was able to spill some tea about my crush na nag ask daw sa isang ka workmate namin to go out for coffee. And natameme ako sa narinig ko, all this time naging tanga ako for not being able to realize na he's liking someone else, I felt so dumb for even hoping na pwede or baka may kami 😭😭 I tried inviting him to go out (ang kapal ng mukha ko) pero may iba na pala syang iniinvite to go out (wala akong laban dahil totoong pogi din karibal ko, eh ako cute lang awrahan ko 😭). I unsent all my messages from day 1 up to our last convo. And guess what ang tanga, I chatted him nito lang New Year's Eve and send him my drunk pics 😭😭 pero I told him na I will redeem myself and move on. Kahit mahirap gagawin ko, kahit masakit pipilitin kong magpakatatag. I may not have the power to dictate the heart. But I hope in another universe merong kami. Ngayong 2025 kung kami talaga, ewan ko, tulad nga ng isa sa mga lines ng favorite song ko na Blue  by Kai ""I'll trust the universe will always bring me to you"" (even tho I know naimposible na💔)

Hydroponic gardening is a hobby I’m really passionate about. I’ve been growing kale, lettuce, bok choy, microgreens, Thai basil, Genovese basil, cilantro, and Italian parsley. It’s such a fun and rewarding experience, and I’d love to connect with others in the Las Vegas area who are interested in it—whether you’re a total beginner or an experienced grower!

I know it can be hard to meet people in Las Vegas sometimes, and this group might be a great way to connect with others who share similar interests. It’s a pretty small group right now, but it would be wonderful to add some new members. If you’ve never tried hydroponic gardening before, don’t worry—we can even help you get started! It’s somewhat easy and not labor intensive.

Members use all kinds of methods and systems, like Aerogarden, Gardyn, the Kratky method, and more. We meet every month or two at different locations across the valley, chosen by the group. Over coffee, breakfast or lunch, we chat about what we’re growing, share pictures, sometimes swap supplies, and just enjoy good company. Next meetup is probably 1/19/25.

If this sounds like something you’d enjoy, feel free to join us! The facebook group is called Lettuce Drink Coffee - Las Vegas

1hrw3w7,https://i.redd.it/evsfd7xzllae1.jpeg,Making a nice gesture and having it flipped on me,"Background… I broke up with him about a month ago after trying therapy for a few months. After the breakup, the therapist pointed to his BPD characteristics and later over text he confirmed his personal therapist has been telling him since we started dating, he’s really exhibiting the signs for BPD and conveniently he never told me. We started talking again post breakup, and I thought that with the new understanding of the BPD maybe there would be some growth for him and we could be less volatile. 

Holidays and his birthday this time of year are very difficult for him and he feels very alone and suicidal, so I’ve let my guard down a bit and we’ve been talking more and seeing each other. It’s been really sad because I see him taking accountability for the verbal abuse in our relationship and I see how broken he is, and how much he wishes we could be together. He knows we can’t, because he hasn’t changed and will continue to hurt me. So we’re in this weird purgatory phase where we love and care for each other but know the relationship isn’t a possibility. I know it’s a ticking time bomb but I can’t help myself. 

NY day I showed up at his house with a huge brunch food spread as a surprise, because last week he mentioned that in the relationship I wouldn’t surprise him like he did often for me. He had been up until til 5 am driving Uber for some side cash. He was nice at first and we were cuddling in bed, then he starts texting a lot behind me. I notice a pack of cards on the night stand that are dating questions and ask. He dismisses it mostly but that confirms to me he’s had a girl in the bed. He had cried that week to me about how messed up he is and how it’s unethical for him to ever date. How he’s toxic and bad for people, yet he has these fucking relationship starter question on the nightstand. I got very quiet and in my feelings. 

He gets up without saying anything and makes himself coffee. I get up and ask which of the food he wants to keep and he says none of it, he didn’t want to eat any of it but thanks for the gesture I guess. I tell him I’m leaving and storm out. I’m hurt, shaking, crying. Instead of empathizing about why that would upset me, he starts texting me a made up narrative about how I wanted to steal his whole day and be couch creatures, how I was just lonely and needed to use him, how I violated boundaries by surprising him. Because I was upset and left, I’m getting paragraph texts all day from him about how I can’t take accountability for this and how I need to empathize with him. He called and yelled at me, said I’m a “fucking codependent”. I’ve been trying to ignore this all day by just disengaging, telling him let’s go back to no contact.

Hi, I'm M(21) met a girl in dating app. The problem is, because of her actions I'm losing interest.

Context: We're both in college, on our last yr. She's a med student and I'm an engineering student. At first we're talking to each other nonstop, calling, and doing random stuffs online. On our first meet up, i felt really happy, since she's the first girl I've dated after almost a year of being single. We watched movie, ate lunch nd dinner, and took coffee at a local coffee shop. She's actually kind, pretty, and interesting. Nasundan pa pagkikita namin, and she's also NBSB. She told me na, almost a month pa lang niya pinatigil last suitor nya, since hindi raw vocal yung last suitor niya, hindi siya ina upd ganon. Na-d drain daw siya sa ganong set-up. So, ako naman pala upd talaga ako, and very vocal. Kahit anong gawin, puntahan ko, sinasabi ko. And gusto ko rin ganon partner ko. The problem is, hindi siya pala upd sakin, hindi magchachat for hours (mostly naka duty sa hospi), minsan hindi ko alam kung asan siya. Nagwoworry lang ako, kasi gusto ko siya and sinimulan ko na rin siyang ligawan. I'm doing my vv best, giving her gifts, letters, flowers, taking her on dates and stuffs. And na open ko sa kanya na, nakakadrain kapag hindi siya nag u upd, okay naman naging usapan. Nagsorry siya, and sinabi niya na mag u upd siya. Pero after non, wala namang nagbago, ganon pa rin. I don't think if may karapatan ba ako na magreklamo, or eto yung risk na I would take. Hindi ko alam, kasi hindi naman mauubos oras sa isang upd na 'jgh', 'jwu' or whatever. I'm really not feeling great lately, na t trigger anxiety ko. I'm so anxious kapag nag memessage na siya. And sometimes I felt na, I'm begging for her time. Kasi kahit anong late ng reply niya, I would reply agad. Hindi ko alam guys, wtd. Now, I don't feel the same as before kapag kausap siya, parang nawawalan ako nang gana. Pero I like her so much.

**Onset of Effects:**

* Felt the medication start working a bit quicker today, within about 20 minutes.
* Had a cup of coffee and ate a couple of granola bars to have something in my stomach.

**Effects:**

* Stayed productive throughout the day and accomplished a lot.
* Focus was strong and lasted for approximately 8 hours.
* Experienced a few irritation issues but nothing unmanageable.
* First noticeable ""crash"" after the medication wore off—headache and a spacey feeling in my head.

**Side Effects:**

* No nausea or other physical discomfort.
* Mild irritation and occasional moments of frustration.

**Sleep:**

* No significant issues noted with sleep.

**Plan:**

* Continue the routine tomorrow and monitor any changes, particularly around the crash.

so I have a question and maybe already answered.  But does anyone have a particular routine they do when they have the crash at the end of the day.

We keep getting in the same argument. We go along fine for weeks, maybe a month and then he says something cruel/ insensitive to me and when I point that out he is silent. Sometimes walks away. I stew and get upset. I notice that our relationship sucks compared to what it was 10 years ago. We don’t spend quality time together, we barely have sex. We generally get along really well, cuddle and have good conversation but is that enough? 

I ask him if he cares. He says he does, that he’s busy (we have 2 toddlers). I ask if we can spend time together and he says yes. If I spell it out, he will apologize for making me feel shitty in above argument. 

But I don’t feel appreciated or loved. I used to think we were soul mates now I don’t know what we are. I don’t think he’s interested in being romantic with anyone but if he is I don’t think it’d be with me. 

Words are good, less so when I have to pull them out of him. The lack of action just makes me think he couldn’t care less. 

Our lives are busy and I really don’t think I could manage the household and kids on my own. We have some debt we’re working on together. I really wonder if I would stay with him if it wasn’t for convenience which is so heartbreaking to think about because I still love him so much but it’s a version of him that I don’t think exists anymore. 

The argument that sparked my existential crisis today was dumb and small. When he noticed I was offended he stood and left while we were having a coffee break together at work (different departments, same building). I waited for 10 minutes then texted “that was a shitty way to leave”. He blamed my attitude, when I explained that he was being rude to me he said “sorry”. I said it sucked to be left, he said “sorry”. I said it didn’t feel genuine or like he cared and he said “not trying to be dismissive, sorry”. 

I typed out the following:

“I don’t understand why you couldn’t apologize here rather than leaving. I don’t get walking away when I’m upset unless you don’t care. Your responses are generic and tired. You don’t look at me. You only want to spend time with me if it’s hobby you want to do. I’ve begged for you to prioritize dates with me and you haven’t planned a single one. It crushed me that you said no when I wanted to get breakfast with you tomorrow. I’m so sad that you’re over putting effort into our relationship.  I’m glad you’re comfortable with me but I want more in a marriage. I don’t know how to get through to you. I don’t know what to do. I feel alone. “

But I didn’t send it. I feel like I’m talking to a black hole. I just said “I’m trying to move on and find joy in other aspects of my life”. Like I need to stop trying to change who we are. I guess he took that literally and said “again, I’m sorry for walking away but this seems deeper for you. I won’t be home when you pick up the kids, I wish you the best”. 

Do I just let him go? If I say I want him to stay he would but I think the last 4 years of repeat means nothing will change. If he leaves without a fight does that mean that I’m right, he doesn’t care? It’s not like I have free time to date someone new right now… is it even worth it to split up? And my last worry, is this just what it’s like with little kids, should I wait it out until he has time to devote to me? 

I don’t want to regret this for the rest of my life but I don’t think I’m happy. There’s no abuse. He’s nice. I’m attracted to him. I love him, I don’t feel loved. 

TLDR: my husband and I are drifting apart. I mistyped a text and he took it as separating (I think?) and he was quick to say he’s leaving. What do do!? How long do I hold on for? Help!",2,1735830980.0,relationships,5,1.0,False

So myself F29 and my boyfriend 38M have been dating over 1 year. We started dating after he offered me a room in his house for free when I moved cities as the place i had to get right away was crazy expensive. We agreed a rent price which I pay monthly but out living lifestyles are polar opposites. I like a clean and neat house where he has no problem being messy. Mind you the house is super old so it challenging to make it look clean. I feel like I carry the weight of the household cores. He seems to only care about cleaning when his son comes over (every 2 weeks for a weekend). He says too tired the days he's working and too tired his days off to clean. Yet I find myself cleaning everyday when I come home from work I've to spend 20 minutes clearing the kitchen counters and sink just to be able to grab myself coffee and food before I can sit down. I even stopped doing the laundry thinking he might actually do something but one day we were to head out for lunch but he said he had no clean underwear to wear. And yet still didn't bother to put a wash on I had to do it. My own job is super stressful and my mum has recently became ill so I'm between the new city and home right while also studying in my spare time. When I come back to his after a stressful few days with my mum he doesn't even think to tidy the house a bit I'm just met with laundry pile, dirty dishes, a messy house and empty food cupboards and a fridge. I've tried talking to him about this but all I get is defensiveness and an argument. Living like this is causing me so much stress I feel like I can't sit down and relax in this house now. I'm thinking of moving out on my own but not sure how to approach this conversation with him. I've no problem continuing the relationship but I can't carry the weight of him and myself with everything I have going on.

I wanted to take a moment to recap on the last year, as this was the crucial one for me. Mainly because at the beginning of it I didn't really think about becoming an Indie Dev, I definitely was not thinking about creating a game, and for sure was not even considering that by the end of the year I will have a semi-official but still..indie game dev ""studio"". Maybe this story will be motivating to some of you that are here thinking if you should even start.

Grab a drink and I hope you get something valuable out of it. Would say it will be brief...but I hate lying ;-)

# Prologue

I am 39 years old, living in PL with my family (one wife, three daughters, one military snail in an old abandonded aquarium, and lately a hamster - again).  
I work as a teamlead/manager of a little polish/dutch dev hub for a Dutch-based branch of a multinational corporation. I am an experienced developer, although nowadays I spent most of my time making sure nobody is bothering my team, shouting at people when they try doing so, and drinking coffee.

I always loved to create and whenever I started something I always thought about creating something in that space. Whether it was professional career, a hobby like woodworking or leatherworking, and even sports like running - I love ultra running. ... it was always this thought of: ""Hey, maybe I could create something here""..a business, a product, a service...something written, visual or physical....

I started few things but it was always lacking something..a physical product lacked the dev excitement. The website or a portal with services was lacking this element of something more visual and interactive..so on and so forth...and then it dawned on me. There is one thing that has it all..**and that is ..games.**

I won't lie that I am a guy that loooves to play games...I don't have time for that with a job, a family, juggling many responsibilities..but somehow this idea to put 12 more hats on my head with this game dev journey was pulling me more and more towards itself.

[Let's go....](https://preview.redd.it/qhbcx693dlae1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7021c582d40bde703fad3963f511705a77258642)

# 2024: The Beginning

I started fairly late cause according to the memory of ChatGPT with which I tend to talk a lot lately (#so Alone) the first ideas I had about the game development were mentioned somewhere around 25th of October (just 15 days after my third daughter has been successfully deployed to this world).

I quickly realised that indie dev is a lot more complex than I initially thought:

* the game itself
* the skills you need to acquire
* the promotion
* the Steam page
* the sound
* the visuals
* the story....it is a lot.

**So. Awesome !!!**

# What I managed to do ?

So you might be wondering. How much can you do in the mornings/evenings daily ? Well. Here is a bit of a recap of what I started with and managed to do:

* I spent a multitude of hours coming up with an idea for the first game. It resulted in multiple documents with GDD, mechanics analysis, scope planning for the game and the demo, etc...
* I created a simple working studio page with the press kit, brand identity and mailchimp connection and first emails templates.
* I created a simple working game landing page with another press kit
* I've setup socials on major platforms: Youtube, X, TikTok, Bluesky, Reddit, Instagram, Facebook, Itch\_IO
* I've setup a Discord server which has a total of 5 members as we speak :D ...me included
* I've prepped all the Steam graphical assets and have published my game page to Steam.
* I've created a simple marketing strategy and posting plan so that I can start building those wishlists early.
* I identified my strenghts (mostly dev side) and weaknesses (isometrics and sound).
* I started the course in Unity and a course in isometrics
* I translated the Steam Page into the chosen 7 languages
* I started posting regularly on the chosen socials and planned next steps.

**When I list that now it really looks impressive.**

[It's alive !!!](https://preview.redd.it/q4p9t351klae1.png?width=959&format=png&auto=webp&s=80a13cac0f09db462ec41ce72afd6d1a7bda2e57)

# Lessons learned

So, it has been 2 months of 2024. I did quite a few things of which I am really happy. I learned a lot in this short period of time. Some of those lessons are worth mentioning:

**Practice makes progress**  
This is crucial. Practice makes perfect is a lie. If you get caught up with this strive for perfection you'll end up polishing it to death. **Just make progress.**

**Discipline over dopamine**  
Sure, I love watching Thomas Brush or BiteMe Games videos..but that is just empty dopamine hits if you don't focus PRIMARILY on doing....**Start doing.**

**Little steps...every day**  
I just did a quick short about this today. Just list all little things you can do, and start doing them. Ticking them off. One by one.  
You can't make a full website today ? No. But you can register the domain.  
You can't create all Steam Page assets in a day ? No. But you can prep one.  
**Little .Steps.Consistently.**

**Marketing & Creation**  
That might be the biggest one. Do you want to create the game or do you want to publish it ? Cause if you just want to create...then ditch the whole logistics I just wrote about. Just get creating...but...BUT....if you want to publish, maybe sell...and hopefully make some money out of it...maybe it is good to think about the marketing and creating simultaneously.

# What is next ?

Now, 2025 has started. We all want to make the best use of it for sure. For me it comes down to one big goal and a multitude of other, smaller goals:

**The Main Goal**  
Get a working, highly polished demo of my game out by Q3 of 2025

This might come at you as a surprise. And it is something we need to learn. **Patience**. Sure I'd love to see the game release as soon as possible. But I also know that if I rush...I will fail.

**The Multitude**

This is where I have a huge respect for the whole indie dev community. This playground comes with so many sandboxes that you can easily spend the whole year in one, and still be an amateur. So lets list some of those with sample things I need to excel in. Maybe you will find something for yourself here too:

**Development Goals**

I want the vertical of the game ready with the demo. So all mechanics, visual feel and level design has to be there, verified, developed and tested.

**Marketing Goals**

* Here, one word - Consistency. I want to publish regularly...That is it.
* Another one is the teaser/trailer. If I want the demo to be somewhat successful I need to have some materials to promote it.
* Wishlists ...I started with the Steam page early for a reason. Building that community and regular content creation is for the reason of growing that wishlist number.

**Skills**

This comes down to knowing your strengths and weaknesses: For me I know I will have a hard time with sounds and music. I have some ideas but this is where I either need to excel..or consider help. Another one is game graphics. I want to make them on my own...but need some skills honing.

**Ambitious**

This section is for the goals that might be a bit stretchy. For me it is game specific. I have a specific cooperations in mind that would benefit the game. But it has to be approached visely and at the right time.

# Timeless Treasures

I don't want to overly promote the game. But just a paragraph for those who might be interested:

Timeless Treasures: The Lost Artifact is the hidden object/puzzle/adventure game that takes you as a time traveller into the ancient eras like: Egypt, Greece, Rome, China, Mayans. You uncover hidden items, manipulate time to solve puzzles and gather lore that makes up your own virtual museum of ancient knowledge.

I want to have a dual gameplay mode there also. Think point & click with occassionaly sending your character into the tame scene to help you out with puzzles (Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines Style)

With a quirky radio host that travels with you, plays you some era-specific music and tells dad jokes you will explore those worlds in a funny, entertaining and educating way.

# Summary

I am really amazed as to how much I was able to pull of. And it is not to brag. It is just that we really can do amazing things if we only dedicate ourselves to it.

**If you read through up till this point, thank you so much.** Hopefuly even one sentence made some sense and maybe helped you see this journey in a different way, a new way.

# How about you ?

**What is your goal..or goals for this year ?**  
**What have you learned last year and will take it with you so that this next one is even better ?**

If you like puzzles, dad jokes and would love to join the journey, I invite you to join the Discord, wishlist on Steam etc...I got banned for stupidly promoting my game on a different sub...so won't post links here.

**Thanks again for reading through.**  
**Have a great, productive and rewarding 2025 ladies and gents.**

Yet, in the quiet moments away from prying eyes, he faces a mundane yet surprisingly complex challenge: dealing with his Kryptonian biology in a human world.

The mighty Superman gets all his strength and energy from the Sun. It powers every cell in his body, making him near invincible. Technically, he doesn’t need food to survive. But to blend in with humans, he joins his friends at the Daily Planet for coffee, burgers, and the occasional pizza night.

Now here’s the twist—what happens after Superman eats? Unlike humans, his Kryptonian body is so advanced that it processes food with incredible efficiency. Scientists theorize his biology might produce little to no waste. But if it does, it must be powerful, much like the rest of him. Imagine a single Kryptonian bowel movement—it could destroy an ordinary toilet, crack the plumbing, or worse!

So, how does Superman handle this?

Many believe he uses his Fortress of Solitude, equipped with advanced Kryptonian technology, to deal with such “personal business.” Every time Superman needs to “go,” he makes a quick trip to the fortress. But that raises another question:

What happens when he’s away on a mission for days, or in a place where even he can’t reach his fortress?

Could Superman have a secret Kryptonian solution even more advanced than we imagine? Or does he sometimes face challenges no one—not even the Man of Steel—is prepared for? And does that make him a human? 

The truth, perhaps, is something only Superman knows. Or… is there more to discover about his Kryptonian life than we’ve ever thought possible?",1,1735830567.0,ChroniclingCuriosity,0,1.0,False

I want to get rid of it.   Any recommendations for a good grinder (not Turin), under $200, that gives bold flavors and little retention?

1hrvnz9,https://www.reddit.com/r/DesignMyRoom/comments/1hrvnz9/help_with_my_living_room/,Help with my living room!!,"Hi All,

I need some help with my living room. Ive been living in this space for 2 years and I cant seem to get it right/ feel happy with the space. I'm sharing the blank photos with you and then providing some context of what i have now.

\- 1 gray sectional couch (not too big-- seats 3/4 ppl) - im not too crazy about this couch.

\- small white coffee table and small white TV stand (not too crazy about these either and willing to replace them)

\- 55inch TV

\- Bookshelf

\- peloton tread

The thing is I want to have a dining table here while also having separation between the couch/living room and the peloton tread. Its a pretty decent sized space so its doable I just cannot seem to configure something I am happy with. This is also in a beach area so a sunny beachy vibe would be great. Any and all help is appreciated!!!

My partner and I are planning a 3-4 day trip to SJI from Seattle in the coming weeks and I was hoping to solicit some advice. We are aware it is the offseason and looking forward to a bit of unplugged time together. 

We are PNW folks and not scared off by the weather, looking forward to some outdoor cycling and hiking. We found an an airBNB in Eastsound on Orcas that we are very excited about - but I was curious about the feasibility of doing a day trip to San Juan Island, it seems like there is much to be explored over there, including a wildlife tour, which we would be interested in doing. She is more laid back and excited to read and drink coffee, but I’m going to plan a day or two of more formal activities (ie wildlife tour, museums, etc). Any recommendations for things open in the offseason would be much appreciated, along with food or hike tips!

We haven’t booked the lodging yet, would anybody recommend just staying on San Juan?

Thanks in advance!

She lives 3 hours away.,"My mils behaviour over the years has always baffled me but I just chalk it up to language barrier and different cultures. She doesn’t speak English but I speak her language to b1 level (not that good, but well enough). She has never made an effort with my daughters, and when my first daughter was born called her a nickname meaning nine “nona”. Because my daughter was her 9th grandchild.

So on nye she brings a case over and asks to stay over and says to my husband that she is hungry. Obviously I warm her up some food, she stays over and I don’t say anything. We have an espresso machine that she doesn’t know how to use. I had been up with our children for several hours when she wakes up on New Year’s Day. She says to me “vou tomar café agora” “I’ll drink coffee now”. Weird way to ask someone to make you a coffee. When she leaves in the morning, she thanks me but doesn’t apologise for the out of nowhere visit.

My husband said he told her to give us more notice next time but ultimately his mum should be able to drop round whenever she feels like it. And that if my mum did the same he’d welcome her with open arms (🙄) she lives in another country. But did say she should have asked me to make her coffee in a nicer way.

So when i met her i knew her ex ( we dont know each other very well and i think he is childish)

So my gf we will call her for example Jane, she was 1 year in a relationship with this guy and when i asked her why was she with him ( because i also didnt see why would she a pretty girl be with him), she told me she didnt really like him and she didnt know why she was in that relationship ( isn't that kinda strange, being in a forced relationship for 1 year?)

Ok, never mind, so also apparently they didnt kiss for 6 months either while into a relationship ( also kinda weird)

Her manners were nice, while i was working over the summer ( i am a student and for years i work across summer) She comes over, meets me with her friends, if i need something she will help me and those are some of the things i really liked and i think everyone would.

My love language is touch ( i had sex with a few girls before) and she is a virgin.

Now also 3 months in, i havent done anything except get my hand under her bra.I am kinda getting bored of getting coffees blah blah because like i also get into a thinking of like ""What if she isnt attracted by me""

Maybe she likes my personality only?

Or maybe she just wants to have a guy for help not for love, i did ask her about all that, how does she feel about taking it a little further, when asked. she said she doesnt know when she will be ready for anything

It could be a week, a month , a year. She told me she is scared of getting called a whore if she has sex or that it doesnt guarantee her that the person that htakes her virginity will stay with her.

I do understand these, sometimes i feel manipulated by her also sometimes ( maybe im just insecure )

I always told her i dont like her friends from uni ( its just some high school drama or something )So one time i was on a coffee with my female friend from college and my male friend which is her cousin ( she is also in a relationship for 7 years), and we had a project and week prior to this we had an argument about her why i drove her home ( i just thought it was okay because her cousin was next to me and i am going the same way , its raining)

And week before her birthday she tells me this guy who likes her alot , she wont call him on her birthday, she just told him that he is not invited.And while we meet up she wants to guilt trip me or something, when i said i was on a coffee with this girl im on a project with and her cousin. She just kinda doesnt say anything.Okay she is telling me she is going to call this guy on her birthday ( i dont like him, he talks about us to her best friends, some way about how i treat her and he likes her and would take the chance to be with her probably) And she is trying to tell me how she will call him on her birthday and after that night i told her to get out oof the car and shjut the door.After she tells me she is sorry because she got nervous and said that.

but a lot of the common sugar substitutes have potential side effects.

Recently i discovered that Trehalose, a plant based artificial sweetener, blocks the liver from storing glucose as Fat.  Some internet references even seemed to say it could be used as a treatment for fatty liver disease, reversing the past.

But most of these papers were from back in 2016 or so.  I can not find anything recent, as in 2024, still saying trehalose is good stuff.

So my question, is anyone here using trehalose for fatty liver issues?  And has it worked?  Were there unpleasant side effects?

1hrvdrk,https://www.reddit.com/r/PDXDND/comments/1hrvdrk/dmgm_campaign_building_meetup/,DM/GM Campaign Building Meetup,"Hi everyone,

I've been running a campaign for a few months now. We started in 5e but recently switched to Dungeon World because I’m not really into running heavy mechanics. Focusing more on story just feels better for the table, and I think it’ll lead to a more enjoyable game.

That said, I’ve realized that campaign building can feel pretty isolating. I often get stuck on what to plan or how to organize story beats. Sometimes I end up pushing things to the next session because I’m unsure of what comes next. It often feels rushed and disorganized, but I know it doesn’t have to be this way.

I want to improve my process and make campaign building as fun and engaging as playing the game itself. After months of DM YouTube videos, I’ve realized what I really want is to talk specifics with others. Tell me about your BBEG. Share the ideas that your players totally missed. Tell me about what feels essential for an encounter at your table. Collaboration is joyful.

Whether you’re a veteran DM/GM or just starting out, would you be interested in meeting up for coffee, dinner, or drinks to chat about campaign design, storytelling, and roleplaying? My hope is to build a group where we can swap ideas, solve challenges, and connect. Talking things out with others always boosts my confidence—and it’s just way more fun.

If this sounds like your kind of thing,  comment or send me a PM. I was thinking we could start meeting once a month and see how it goes.

Looking forward to meeting some fellow adventurers :)",2,1735829474.0,PDXDND,3,1.0,False

Think cats vs. dogs, coffee vs. tea, pineapple on pizza… but for your workspace. Let’s dig in!

**Open Layouts: The Social Butterflies**

These spaces are like the extroverts of office design—open, inviting, and a little noisy. Open layouts foster collaboration, encourage spontaneous brainstorming, and make it easier to shout, “Does anyone have a stapler?!” They’re great for teams that thrive on energy and interaction.

**The Perks:**

Collaboration on steroids 🚀

A sleek, modern look that feels spacious

Flexible and cost-effective

**The Downsides:**

Noise, noise, and more noise

Privacy?

Hard to focus when Ken from Payroll keeps talking about his weekend on the lake.

**Closed Layouts: The Introverted Classics**

These layouts say, “Hey, we need some boundaries.” Private offices and cubicles rule the day, offering focus zones, quiet time, and a sense of personal space.

**The Perks:**

Fewer distractions

Privacy for sensitive work

Defined spaces for better organization

**The Downsides:**

Can feel isolating for some

Less collaboration without intentional meeting spaces

A bit more traditional (though retro can be cool, right?)

**The Hybrid Sweet Spot: Best of Both Worlds?**

Many modern offices now go hybrid—open layouts with quiet rooms, pods, or phone booths sprinkled in. It’s like having cake and eating it too. 🍰

I went to Turkey and got a real bad stomach flu or food poisoning, i dont know. I felt so sick and had bad diarrhea, but i didnt vomit (emetophobic). And then after every two weeks when i had eaten something like pizza or hard to digest food i had the same feeling like i had in Turkey. Feeling so so sick and diarrhea again. Then by the end of June i ate pretty bad and woke up the next day with bad nausea and appetite loss and it lasted for two weeks straight! Every single morning bad nausea which let up by the evening, i really thought i was going to go crazy. I went to the emergency room and they scheduled me for a colonoscopy because i also had bright red blood in stool and lots of it. But then the nausea stopped and i resumed to regular life, the colonoscopy was clean and they thought i just had a bowel inflammation because my calprotectin levels were high. Anyway fast forward to the end of november, i started to feel bouts of nausea, but nothing too long or extreme, i still ate the same (badly i might add) and now on the 22nd of December we had Christmas with some of my family and i had KFC. And after that something happened, i got bad chills sitting right there and extreme nausea, but it passed. I woke up the next day and thats when everything started - first it was just appetite loss and i felt my stomach, i cant describe it any other way, like a heaviness or knot or something, it continued all throughout Christmas and i tried to not eat any sweets or particulary much. But the feeling did not get better, i then cut out everything, didnt drink coffee, no sweets, no bread just rice galettes, rice, chicken, potato, carrot (all steamed, no seasoning). 
I went to the emergency room again because then i couldnt eat anything without feeling burning in my chest, i have chills, i feel so nauseous especially in the morning and in the evening and night. The days seem to be so so. I now have really gone to only chicken broth and water, to maybe give my stomach some break. I was prescribed Nexium 80mg for a week. I dont feel it does anything really. I cannot eat anything without feeling sick and burning for hours. 
Funny enough, there doesnt seem to be any pain involved, but the burning and nausea and everything is just driving me insane. I started with Lexapro again to maybe eliminate some of the stress and anxiety. Its going to be a week til i can see my GP and mentally i dont now how i will do. Also if i cant eat anything solid or substantial i fear that i will just collapse. 
Im a mother of a toddler also, and i feel like my life is slipping away, i cant do anything. 
Does anyone have a similar story or maybe some suggestions?

1hrv0s5,https://www.reddit.com/r/toddlers/comments/1hrv0s5/tantrums_before_language/,Tantrums before language?,"My 14 month old has entered the toddler phase, including tantrums. She went from being the sweetest chillest baby to having crying screaming fits seemingly at random. She has also developed bad separation anxiety and freaks out whenever I try to leave her at the gym daycare (this is new behavior). 

I know tantrums aren’t rational, but because she can’t speak yet, I never know if she’s upset because she can’t communicate a reasonable thing or if she’s just being toddler-y. For example she screams and cries when we drink our morning coffee until we give her our cups. Sometimes giving her her own mug stops it, other times she won’t stop until I finish my coffee and hand her my mug. She wants to use adult silverware and gets upset when we try to hold her hand when we walk places where she could get hurt if she runs off. But she’ll also behave the same way if she’s too warm or cold or wants a different but still healthy and reasonable snack or we’re leaving family she loves…like normal baby reasons to be upset. She understands a lot so I try to acknowledge the feeling while disciplining/stopping the bad behavior, but I don’t think she really gets it. Distraction and giving in to her desires (when they are harmless) are the only things that calm her down. But I’m wondering if this means I’m reinforcing the idea that screaming and crying get her what she wants? It’s hard to tell because I don’t know what she comprehends. I want to respond in ways that encourage good behavior and communication, but I’m sure part of the tantrums are because she can’t tell us what she needs.

Im a 21 year old male in college, and I’ve been usikg nootropics through the years. Things like piracetam, cdp choline, alpha gpc,etc… 
This last month, I was dealing with a pec strain and I thought I would add in MSM at 4 grams to my regime. I was only using coffee, methylated b-vitamins, and anti-oxidants. Then on the fifth day of MSM I added alpha gpc, that night I felt a lot of spasms, the next day I had more MSM, and coffee, and choline through eggs… I had some sort of crisis that day and, I was nauseous, lightheaded, high blood pressure, shivering, sweating, and trembling. I managed to go 3 days before I couldn’t take it and went to an urgent clinic. All my tests were fine and I was discharged. 2 weeks later, symptoms hadn’t left and I went to the ER, and nothing was detected aside from 3.5 potassium. I was given fluid and discharged. It has now been 3 weeks since and I’ve had a follow up and we’re currently in a process of elimination. But they wont listen to the MOA of the supplements. I believe MSM can chelate toxins, and if done too fast bring on symptoms, in addition to contributing to acetylcholine production, then the alpha gpc of course so does too, and the coffe inhibits the enzyme.

My current symptoms are palpitations, muscle spasms, blurry vision, muscle pain and intolerance to high choline foods.

The only finding has been I have high bilirubin “1.5mg/dl” but normal enzymes.
My ck and creatinine are low so no muscle breakdown.

I know this is very complex, but could someone help me make some sense of this? I thought it would just go away

1hruwed,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1hruwed/small_changes_in_gravity/,Small changes in gravity,"Did you ever look upwards through the corner of the window, driving in the back seat of the car as a child on the way home? It's strange, the smells and lights we drove past in years leading up to the millennium. Sinking into the seat and looking up on one of those evening drives back home, wires of the electricity grid dip and gain. Like wild insect feelers, the powerlines leap from pole to pole. When safe at home, the low hum of fans and appliances remain quietly on — the incandescently lit shopfronts and blur of night people walking: dream of an unrevealed segment in life. It was more fun looking at this blur through childhood eyes, tucked into a bed not knowing rich and poor neighbourhoods.

I know what being poor is like now, but I still look out the window. It troubles me more these days. These chords in the wires we still drive by are a  digital conduit and disappointment. The dotted lines on the road a melody of our advanced society. Days after school when it rained, I'd crawl into a spare cardboard box and imagine it as my fort, listening to the rain and waiting for the cabin to melt back into the outside world. ""Dinner"" — mom.

I still look up at the wires on the interstate at night. It's the second Honda Prelude I've owned; 4th generation. Build date: when I was in a cardboard box. She glides over the dotted lines while I look out the window and listen — a small habit I've tuned into. I listen to the sounds refracting off road barriers from the engine bay, scared of a mechanical fault. Probably okay, but those clever engineers in Japan did design her with fibre-reinforced metal cylinders. The H23A1 engine is prone to eating up piston rings. We're on the road, though, and it's a quiet night. The speedometer dips in and out of action due to dry solder on its motherboard behind the dash—built back when supply chains recognised the danger and hastily reduced lead solder.

We're driving down the highway in an old black coupe into New England, Australia. I'm following the wires and the dotted lines because life hasn’t turned out all that fun working at Burger King and no graduation certificate. I make a crust as a programmer online, which has allowed me to continue looking at where those powerlines go. It might just be me, but windows down on the highway, tracing that feeling while sipping a bad black coffee (agaIn), feels right. Black as midnight.

I'm heading to a high-voltage breaker on the edge of a deep canyon. The mining operation it once fed is presumably defunct. Small towns straddle the highway as we get closer – drained of life since COVID. Driving on a dirt road now, the promiscuity of being here seems more noticeable to the few illuminated country windows in the distance. Why would anyone be here at 2am?

Parked nearby, a short reconnaissance reveals that the power line breakers are open. No power here, which means no people. We're on the edge of a 12,000ft deep gorge, and a rusted box reads, ""33kv link to underground substation."" The wind now gusting up through tree leaves reminds of a feeling in your guts—loneliness. The menthol cigarette doesn't taste good after a few dry puffs either. Chasing this nobody feeling is like wondering what might have been after a first date. That feeling lives here, down in the gorge. Back in the 1920s two thriving towns existed with saloons, schools, and town dances were held every Friday on either side. Before the ground gave way. Supports thick as trees began to explode, splintering miners around them with timbers and shrapnel rock. They were half a mile below the gorge floor, and the hints of society above faltered not long longer after.

It's not a cold night, and I'm following a goat trail down wearing jeans and a t-shirt, sweating yet cold with the wind and a moment's rest. I found the schematics of the mine in an old government database. The plans detail many levels penetrating the ribs of the gorge, but make little note of one tunnel on the eastern face — the 'Ridgeway' tunnel, as later determined from academic articles in a University library, published 1970. The tunnel was originally dug under the sides of the gorge to drain adjacent workings. The article terminates with an open remark on the strong and humid air emanating from a shaft below the gorge floor.

I'm worried about my torch's battery life, but after a long traverse down and across the gorge, the cracked remains of ceramic insulators are out of place on this scrubby ghost track. The Ridgeway tunnel appears out of a rock face, covered in rusted construction mesh. Scraping in, the tunnel is painted white like a laboratory and goes deep into the wall of the gorge. Stainless steel desks and crumbling plywood are organised along the flanks.

This is where they tried to understand gravity, back in 1970. It's not all that important, until you understand the long-term effects. Walking further, the skeleton of a 3-axis gravimeter emerged. Miles of steel pipe, repurposed from the compressor shack of an old mine. These once held a laser apparatus generated in a chamber here, projecting onto instruments delicate enough to sense the pull of the moon. The humid air is still blowing from somewhere deeper underground.

They were onto something big, if you think about it. Miles of coastline are populated by corals and would collapse along with ecosystems given  a small change in gravitational tides. Over the ages of the earth, this has shifted — through glaciation and otherwise. Small changes in gravity can make a big difference. Life is fragile.

Further down another tunnel, the recording deck of rotary paper seismometers sits rusting, and behind that, a glass cabinet with a biological barrier and gloves separating it from the atmosphere. I don't recognise the delicate brass instrument inside and scribbles on the wall denote last records of 1974.

Before I failed out of school and all of this, someone had a crush on me. She had just left for Japan on a foreign exchange program. The time retracing my steps over steep terrain back to the car provided ample time for thought. She said she used to scream into her pillow, somewhere at night on the outskirts of Tokyo. I understand what that feels like now. Did the scientists scream into the tunnel, back when things were ""simple,"" in the 1970s?

The Prelude was right where I left her on the ridge under the wires. The key barrel illuminates with a green halo; pinnacle of Japanese engineering at the time. The lost lead the lost and we need fuel.",40,1735828117.0,HFY,0,0.98,False

I find the concept generally appealing, but the way I've always done it (writing one thing I'm grateful for each morning) leads to two problems:

1. Writing the same things over and over - Especially because it's always in the morning, I end up with ""coffee"" in about 50 places. 

2. Looking at it backwards - in 2024 my car was rear ended, written off, and I had to buy a new car, which was financially stressful. Seeing ""good car"" in my gratitude log from the week before that really shifted my perspective from ""I'm so glad I have these things"" to ""I could lose these things at any moment."" Which, yes, I understand that's supposed to make me appreciate them, but depending on my emotional state it can also just make me anxious about my life falling apart.

You bring popcorn to movie night, and somehow it disappears. “I thought you were saving it for later!” No, Karen, you thought wrong. 🙅‍♂️

### Level 8: The Emoji Overloader
Every text is like a neon sign. “Let’s meet at 6! 🎉🌮❤️🤣” Cool, can you remove a few? It’s like receiving a colorful explosion every time my phone buzzes! 💥

### Level 9: The “No Filter” Master
You’d think they were raised in a barn. “So, when are you having kids?” Uh, maybe when you learn how to read the room? How about we not make it awkward, OK? 😳

### Level 10: The Know-It-All
They’ve read *everything*, or at least that’s what they claim. “Actually, the correct way to hold a spoon is…” Enough! We’re not signing up for a culinary lesson. 🍴

Oh, you thought you had problems? Wait till you hear theirs! “So there I was, in the middle of a tornado, without my favorite shoes!” Okay, let’s roll with your emotional rollercoaster—just maybe tone it down? 🎢

### Level 12: The Convenience Friend
They’re only around when it’s convenient for them. “Wanna hang out?” Sure…but only after I finish my Netflix binge! 🛋️

### Level 13: The Passive-Aggressive Guru
They’ve mastered the art of backhanded compliments. “Wow, you really look comfy today!” Ouch! Is that an insult or a compliment? Let’s work on clarity! 😅

### Level 14: The Over-Analyzer
Every plan you make gets dissected to the core. “Well, according to my calculations, it’s statistically better to leave at 5:31 PM.” Just let us live a little, please! 📊

### Level 15: The Eternal Complainer
Every gathering is a complaint fest. “The coffee’s cold, the chairs are uncomfortable…” Okay, buddy, but have you checked out those snacks? 🍪

### Level 16: The Blabbermouth
Remember that secret you told them? Yeah, good luck keeping that under wraps! “Oh, I thought everyone knew you had a crush on Mr. Perfect!” 😳

### Level 17: The Guilt-Trip Pro
They don’t actually want to hang out but accept your invitation just to make you feel bad. “I guess I can cancel my plans.” Seriously? Just say you’re busy! 👈

### Level 18: The Self-Centered Storyteller
All stories are somehow about them. “That reminds me of that time I…” Wait, we were talking about my cat being adorable, so take a seat! 🐱

### Level 19: The Commitment-Phobe
“A relationship? I’m just not ready.” That’s cool, but leading someone on for months isn’t the answer either! Let’s not play games, people! 💔

### Level 20: The Ultimate Phantom
They vanish without a trace. “Hey, where’d they go?” Ghosting is cool in horror movies, but in friendships? Not so much! 👻

### Final Thoughts:
Every “asshole” has their quirks, but that doesn’t define them entirely. We all have our moments, and recognizing these traits with humor can help us keep things light. So the next time someone’s acting like a level 8, remember it’s all in good fun—and maybe give them a little grace! After all, we’re all in this beautifully chaotic life together, right? 🤷‍♂️❤️",2,1735827857.0,theassholeclub,0,1.0,False

When I personally find coffee dates boring it’s not even about it being “ cheap”. It just feels like a quick outing you have with a co worker instead of a romantic interest and I prefer not to feel like I’m going on a job interview for a first date. I’ve seen women on social media basically say the same thing and get dragged for not liking coffee dates by both men and women claiming “ you don’t deserve a relationship because you won’t go on a coffee date “.

I hate myself so much today :( I’m on a 3 week holiday just for caffeine withdrawal and I was doing fine the first 15 days. But today I got weak… The little craving monster inside myself told me that I could drink coffee in moderation. But unfortunately I can’t! Since I quit smoking 15 years ago, caffeine is my replacement drug. So today I started with one coffee, then another one, another one and another one.  Now I ended up, sitting in my bed, feeling really bad anxiety and waiting for a sleepless night. I really need to stop caffeine because it kills my sleep, triggers my anxiety and makes me so stressed that I nearly became an alcohol addict to just cope with those symptoms.

Whenever your inner voice tells you that you could drink caffeine again, don’t do it! It’s just a trick of your brain that wants to get rid of the cravings. Be aware, when you relapse you will regret it!",3,1735827838.0,decaf,2,0.81,False

Seeking advice on what to do next,"About a week ago, I matched with this girl on Hinge, and we hit it off right away. The conversations were amazing—great banter, deep chats, and late-night talks as we got to know each other. She seemed different from most girls, with hobbies and interests that aren’t all that common. The next day, we had another great chat, and I decided to ask for her Snapchat. That’s when things started to take a turn.

From the beginning, I noticed I wouldn’t get her first message of the day until around 9:00 PM. She also mentioned she was looking for a boyfriend mainly because all her friends were in relationships. We had even planned a date location and time were set but the day before, I didn’t hear from her. When I followed up, she told me she couldn’t make it and suggested rescheduling after New Year’s. I think the idea of meeting up with a stranger for coffee might have freaked her out a bit.

It’s been three days since her last message, and I know I’ve been ghosted. It’s tough because I felt like there was potential. She hasn’t been online on Snapchat for the past two days either, so I’m not sure what’s going on. Part of me wants to just remove her and move on, but another part wants to send a goodbye message for closure. My friends think she was probably just looking for attention.

I’m struggling to find a book that truly interests me. Recently, I read Before the Coffee Gets Cold and What You Are Looking For Is in the Library, but they felt a bit dull and didn’t offer anything new to me. I initially thought I wanted something inspiring, but I have a healthy sense of self-worth and reflect a lot on my own, so those books just didn’t resonate.

I also considered books like Debt: The First 5000 Years, hoping for something thought-provoking, but most of the ones I’ve tried so far felt too simple or obvious—I couldn’t understand why anyone would need a whole book for those ideas.

So, here’s my question: what would be a good book for someone like me? I’m looking for something that helps me grow or genuinely challenges my perspective. I’m not entirely sure which genre would suit me best, but I feel like simple stories might just be a waste of time.

Any recommendations?

1hruosx,https://www.reddit.com/r/theassholeclub/comments/1hruosx/the_tale_of_the_brain_and_the_heart_a_hilarious/,The Tale of the Brain and the Heart: A Hilarious Love-Hate Relationship but who is the asshole? ,"
Once upon a time in the whimsical land of Human Emotion, there lived two very polarizing roommates: the Brain, a certified genius and a know-it-all jerk, and the Heart, a hopeful, gentle soul bursting with kindness. Their story might sound like a crafter’s nightmare—glitter everywhere and emotions running wild—but it's also filled with the precious lessons of coexistence. Buckle up, dear reader—this is going to be a ride on the roller coaster of life!

### The Brain: Mr. Know-It-All

First, let’s talk about the Brain. Picture him as that one friend who brings an entire stack of encyclopedias to a party... and spends the whole night lecturing everyone about the “correct” way to do things. He’s a hard worker, always crunching numbers and overthinking every situation. “Why do you want to go to the beach? The UV index is HIGH! What about skin cancer?!” 🙄

He means well (sort of), but let’s be honest: Brain often forgets that sometimes people just want to *live* a little. Emotions? “Pfft, they’re illogical! Let’s stick to facts, folks!” He can be grumpy, reminding us of every possible bad outcome to decisions that could lead to spontaneous joy. Ever tried to just relax on a Friday night without him piping up about “what you should be doing?” Yeah, thanks for that, Brain. 😒

### The Heart: The Eternal Optimist

Now, enter the Heart—an eternal optimist whose idea of a good time is hugging trees and singing to the stars. “Let’s go for a drive with no destination!” she chirps when all the Brain wants to do is plan a systematic route with a backup spreadsheet (yes, he inconsistently does spreadsheets even in the car!). 🌳✨

The Heart believes in love, friendship, and enjoying every moment—she’s the one who thinks skydiving could totally be spontaneous and life-affirming, while the Brain is panicking about parachute materials and potential wind velocities! “Can’t we just feel the rush and not analyze it for once?” she pleads. 

### A Class Apart: The Drama Unfolds

Can we just take a moment to appreciate that these two are like oil and water? Brain loves facts, while Heart is all about feelings; it’s like putting a cat and a dog in the same room and expecting them to get along. But guess what? They need each other to function!

**Scene 1: The Great Decision-Making Battle**
Imagine a world where Brain decides everything. “We can’t go to that concert! It’s too loud, and the musician might go off-key! Think of the frequency!” No fun, right? Or a world ruled solely by Heart? “Let’s buy a rickety old van and drive to Tulum on a whim because it’ll be an adventure!” Sure, but that van might break down in the middle of nowhere!

### The Power of Compromise: Together They Thrive

Here’s where the magic happens! In this storyline, our Brain discovers that sometimes it’s okay to let loose and enjoy life as Heart bounces in to say, “Hey, let’s plan a little, but why not leave room for spontaneity? Risk is fun!” 🎉

And Heart, in her whimsical wisdom, learns to lean on ol’ Brain for sensible advice when feelings start to overwhelm. “Okay, perhaps I should consider that a 20-hour road trip without snacks is a really bad idea… Thanks, Brain!” 

### The Grand Conclusion: Heart + Brain = Harmony

So, my friends, the moral of this tale is that while Brain can be an insufferable know-it-all and Heart might sway too far into dreamland, they ultimately need each other to function effectively. It’s all about compromise, respect, and laughter along the way! 

When Brain starts overthinking and suffocating the fun, Heart swoops in with some confetti and dance moves, saying, “Let’s live a little!” And when Heart gets swept away in emotion, Brain can softens the edges, reminding her, “Hey, it’s okay to feel deeply, but let’s think this through a bit.”

Together, they can tackle life one wild adventure at a time! So next time you find yourself torn between practicality and creativity, remember the hilarious dynamic duo living within you. Let them chat, share a laugh, and yes, make a pact to coexist. Because at the end of the day, the world is a better place when Brain and Heart learn to work hand-in-hand (or neuron and artery?) for a fulfilling, fun, and balanced life! ❤️🧠✨

### The Call-Out Section: Seriously, What’s Your Problem?

Alright, folks, let’s get real for a hot minute. As wholesome as this tale of Brain and Heart is, we’ve gotta face the truth: both of these characters can be total jerks in their unique ways! 

#### Brain’s Bullheadedness:
Listen, Brain, we get it. You’re smart, like, “calculate the distance from Earth to Pluto” smart. But do you really have to constantly micromanage every single thought? 🙄 Ever tried putting that overthinking to rest? You’re the reason we second-guess choosing a dinner spot!  “What if that spaghetti place has unsanitary practices? What if they reuse old noodles? What if—” Calm down, Chef Brain! You’re ruining the pasta! 🍝 

And it’s so classic of you to respond to feelings with a cold shoulder of logic. “Heart, your breakup is just a statistical anomaly in the vast sea of human relationships!” Wow, thanks, Dr. Buzzkill!  How about a little empathy next time instead of slapping her with cold hard facts? 

#### Heart’s Wishy-Washyness:
Now, let’s slide over to Heart. Girl, we love your passion! But sometimes you're like a leaf caught in a high wind, drifting from one whim to another without any sense of direction. “Let’s buy matching jet skis at 2 AM!” Um, excuse me, but *who* is going to be responsible for navigating that decision? You’re not doing your budgeting homework, and honestly, it’s exhausting! 🎢

And for the love of all that is sensible, can we talk about your habit of throwing caution to the winds? “Let’s text our ex at 3 AM and ask if they want to grab coffee! Emotions are wild!” Thanks for the heartache, Heart! 🙃 Maybe keep the romantic urgency in check and think about the consequences of those wildly impulsive decisions for once?

### An Amicable Appraisal:
So here’s the deal: Brain, you don’t have to dissolve every ounce of joy with your endless analysis. And Heart, you need to chill with the reckless abandon just a smidge! 

You both show up to the party, but sometimes you're like that couple that can’t stop bickering in the corner — and we can all hear you, loud and clear! Instead of calling each other out when one is being an idiot, be a little more understanding. 

The truth is, neither of you is perfect. You both have your moments of being real “assholes” who cause inner turmoil. But, when you recognize those moments, you can have a little laugh, roll your eyes, and say, “Okay, I totally get it. I’ll try to chill, you try not to overthink!” And in doing so, you'll remind each other of the fabulous, funny, and flawed human experience you’re both here to navigate together!

### The Wrap-Up: A Hilarious Harmony
So there you have it, the unfiltered, humorous reality check: Brain and Heart can be total duds sometimes, but they can also shine when they embrace their differences! Balance the impulse and pragmatism, set aside the jerky behavior, and you’ll both find a little laughter along the way. Because, let’s be real, what’s life without a good laugh at your own absurdity? So, dear reader, remember: it takes both an asshole and a dreamer to truly thrive in the wild adventure that is life! ❤️🧠✨",2,1735827510.0,theassholeclub,0,1.0,False
