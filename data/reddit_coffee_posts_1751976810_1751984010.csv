1lupjel,https://www.reddit.com/r/MotionDesign/comments/1lupjel/looking_for_recommendation_what_are_the_online/,Looking for recommendation: What are the online groups/ communities for Canadian design and motion design?,"
Am I just not looking at the right places, or are people much less connected these days? (or maybe we are just older humans now..?)

I am aware of a few Discord and Slack for local Canadian motion design groups but aside of one from Toronto, all of them seem very dead.

Are people just stopping to interact online? Is the motion design industry community as a whole just dying or closed into small local workplace bubbles because of how hard finding work in any creative industry is right now? 

It does seem very different from back in 2013-2017 times when there were a lot of strong and active motion design groups and I at least could grasp a strong sense of an online international design community that was made from many local groups worldwide. (maybe the ""death"" of motionographer, vimeo, blend fest, wine after coffee/ ice cream hater, art of the title, facebook groups  etc probably contribute to it)

1lupg1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/twinflames/comments/1lupg1a/i_cant_stop_thinking_about_this/,I can't stop thinking about this,"I didn't know where to post this, so I'm going to post it here.

I find the idea of ""twin flames"" very romantic. But I also find the idea that my soul is mine alone to be beautiful. 

I'm 50/50 on this matter. 

A couple of days ago I had a meeting with someone and I can't stop thinking about him. 

I've always been a pretty romantic person when it comes to this, and I always thought there would be ""the one."" 

But seeing the state of the world today, I realized that this era we live in is not the era of my soul, so I just go about my daily life, nothing more. 

Well, I recently had a schizophrenic boyfriend, one of the worst experiences of my life. He's already out of my life. 

The day before yesterday I was sitting in a train station in a small town. 
I was alone, rolling tobacco and observing the views, passing the time. It was night. 

Suddenly, a boy appeared out of nowhere, and it seems he came straight towards me. 
He asked me if I had any tobacco, and I said no. 

After that, he sat down on the bench next to me. 
And he began to speak... 

Suddenly I looked at him. 
And I also looked at the overall situation. And I understood that ""something"" was happening there. 

This guy was a little drunk, went to the wrong stop, and was waiting for the train back. 

When I looked at him, this guy was almost identical to an old flame I had when I was a teenager. 
I realized that he was almost identical in appearance, and also in his personal tastes. 
The boy I was a teenager also loved alcohol and parties. 
And this guy told me about this. So he was very similar to the old boy. 

Also the two boys were both Russian (I am also Russian, I live in a non-Russian country). 

This guy's voice felt really good. 
He asked me for a cigarette again, and this time I gave him one. He said, ""You're a very kind person.""

This guy kept saying he wanted to buy me a coffee. 

In the middle of all this, I looked at the time... And it was exactly 22:22. 

It felt like a very ""me"" moment, made for me. 
He and I were alone at the station. He looked so much like the boy from my teenage years (a story left unfinished), even sharing the same nationality. 

I'm extremely shy. I was rolling some cigarettes and he said, ""Shall I help you?"" 

After that, I felt really embarrassed and left. But first, I gave him my number. 

He told me he would call me and he didn't call... 

But the moment felt so... strange. 

I wanted to post this here to get feedback. 

What surprised me is that despite being drunk, he never attempted anything sexual. 

He just sat down on the bench next to me to talk.

I got lost in his gaze, hehe.

After returning he asked me to meet him for coffee. We had a conversation of three hours. He kept on asking about every single details. I didnt expected that. Then the next day he immediately asked to meet agin for dinner. 

We met two days later. We again had three hours of conversation. I didnt eat because I wasnt comfortable with the food. 

The next day, I was sending him few food suggestions.  Suddenly he told me that I was enjoying food with my friend which wasnt the case with him.

I tried to calm down him. He said that we just met twice, I didnt need to act so cosy. I apologised immediately.

Since then its been almost a month. He didnt reach out. I didnt either. 

The second day, On the lift he was kind of touching me.very subtle way though. 

The whole experience is confusing for me.

Now I was checking his social media. He seemed to be going out with a woman who he told me he meets as friends. 

I dont understand why he got mad? Is this because he never liked me? It was just a sexual kind of attraction? I am utterly confused and hurt

You're trapped in the **Enigma Robotics R&D Basement** office after a containment breach. Your goal is to survive the night against experimental animatronics using limited defenses.

# The Setting: R&D Basement Office

You're confined to your office, monitoring two entry corridors (left and right). All systems are managed via two specialized tablets. A non-functional keypad sits on your desk, a relic of inactive systems.

# The Interface: Dual Tablet System

You operate the security system using two distinct tablets, accessed by click or hotkey.

* **Camera Tablet (G):** When active, it displays crucial camera feeds for the **Left Entry Camera** and **Right Entry Camera**. Click to bring up, G to put away. You cannot use defenses while this tablet is active.
* **Defense Tablet (A):** When active, it presents crucial defensive options for both sides of your office. This includes **Left Light**, **Left Door**, **Left Reinforce** (temporarily reinforces door), **Right Light**, **Right Door**, and **Right Reinforce** (temporarily reinforces door). Click to bring up, A to put away. You cannot view cameras while this tablet is active.

# Core Mechanics: Resource Management & Timing

Your survival hinges on managing **limited power** and the **finite durability** of your defenses. Power is a shared meter for all systems. Durability: Your lights and doors have limited durability; each second of active usage (light on, door closed/reinforced) reduces durability by 1% every 6 seconds. If durability reaches 0% for a component, it breaks permanently. This applies separately to Left Light, Left Door, Right Light, and Right Door. Time Scale: Each in-game hour passes quickly; 1 hour equals 1 minute 20 seconds of real-world time, making a full 6-hour night just 8 minutes long. You are confined to your office for the entire night; there's no free roaming.

# The Animatronics: A Volatile Collection

These animatronics rely on direct defense, sound cues, and visual tells.

* **""The Goo-Slinger"" (Identifier: 1033061894):** A hulking, industrial-grade sanitation robot. The more you check its camera feed, the faster it moves. If it reaches an open office door, it's an immediate game over.
* **Simba the Punk:** A stylized lion animatronic with a spiked mohawk. Disabled on Night 1, serving as an unsettling warning. When active, Simba primarily messes with your lighting system. At random intervals, particularly around 3 AM, Simba can cause a complete power surge that disables your office light for 4 seconds (both left and right lights will be unusable). You'll hear a distinct electrical crackle before it happens, giving you a split-second warning. He moves through maintenance tunnels, occasionally visible on camera before striking.
* **Skater the Board:** A sleek, agile animatronic shaped like a skateboarder. If you do NOT click the **""Scream Button""** for 30 seconds, Skater will interpret the silence as a lack of excitement and aggressively move towards your office. The ""Scream Button"" (plays a loud, high-pitched scream) temporarily satisfies Skater, forcing him to retreat. Frequent use draws the attention of Bane the Strong. There's a visible ""Skater Timer"" counting down from 30 seconds in your office.
* **Star Coffee:** A charming, anthropomorphic coffee cup animatronic. It will not move if you do not check its camera feed. However, the moment you check Star Coffee's camera, it activates and begins to move, faster with more checks. If it reaches your office, it triggers a massive short-circuit, causing a sudden, significant power drain and temporarily disabling your camera system for several crucial seconds. This leaves you vulnerable.
* **Bane the Strong (Nickname: 90765):** A heavily built, muscular gorilla-like animatronic. The more you check his camera feed, the faster he moves. He is also strongly attracted to loud noises, particularly the ""Scream Button"" used for Skater. If Bane reaches an open office door, it's an immediate game over. He will also relentlessly bang on closed doors, draining their durability faster than other animatronics.",2,1751983449.0,fnafworld,0,1.0,False

However, yesterday that same guy showed up at her workplace. She told me he wanted to grab ice cream after her shift, and he stayed there until she got off work. She didn‚Äôt say no to him.

I was on a call with her until she finished work, and then suddenly‚Äîboom‚Äîshe disappeared. I didn‚Äôt hear from her for about an hour and a half. When she finally messaged me back, she claimed she had just woken up from a nap.

Honestly, it feels kind of fishy to me. Am I overthinking this or is something off?

1lupbou,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlyChild/comments/1lupbou/dealing_with_anticipatory_grief_and_im_really/,Dealing with Anticipatory Grief and I‚Äôm really going through it‚Ä¶,"I started experiencing anticipatory grief around 18, when I moved away from home for college. I‚Äôm 21F now, and the thought of losing my parents is terrifying. I often cry myself to sleep thinking about it, and it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve never been able to talk to them about. It just feels too heavy.

What scares me the most is the idea of being completely alone after they‚Äôre gone. I know a lot of people have close friends, partners, or spouses to lean on during hard times like that. But I‚Äôve never been good at forming deep friendships. I‚Äôm introverted, shy, and have social anxiety. I guess I‚Äôm kind of boring too. I‚Äôve accepted that I‚Äôm probably not going to get married. I‚Äôm not conventionally attractive, and relationships honestly scare me. I‚Äôd rather protect my peace. 

I constantly wonder how I‚Äôll cope alone. Who‚Äôs going to remember or celebrate my birthday? Who will I share news with - good or bad? Who will know all the little details of my life, laugh at inside jokes, or check in when I‚Äôm sick? Who will I go to for help? The idea that I won‚Äôt be able to hug my parents again, or eat the food they lovingly made for me: it just feels unbearable. That kind of life sounds so empty to me.

There have even been times when I‚Äôve thought about legal euthanasia in parts of Europe. I‚Äôve wondered if, when my parents pass, and if the loneliness becomes too overwhelming, that might be a way out. But I know how devastating that would be for them if they ever found out. It would feel like I was killing them, too, after everything they‚Äôve done for me. And that thought alone is enough to stop me.

I honestly don‚Äôt know what the future holds. I do know that people change a lot over the years, we grow, we get stronger, and maybe even wiser.

I‚Äôve read about men and women: often older, sometimes single their whole lives or outliving their partners, who manage to build deeply fulfilling lives, even without close family or long-term relationships. Their lives might look different from the traditional path, but they are rich in meaning, joy, and purpose.

Some of them spend their time traveling the world - not just to take photos for social media, but to really immerse themselves. They might live for a few months in a quiet coastal town in Portugal, where they wake up early, walk to the market, learn the local language bit by bit, and eat warm pastries at a corner caf√© while reading a good book. Maybe they volunteer at a library, or help stray animals, or tutor kids in English. And in doing so, find a sense of belonging in the unfamiliar.

Others find peace in nature. They might live in small mountain cabins or by a lake, growing vegetables, hiking in the early morning mist, and learning the names of birds and trees. Some take up photography or painting, capturing the subtle shifts of light or the changing of seasons, not for recognition, but just for the joy of seeing the world more clearly.

There are people who stay rooted in one place but fill their lives with meaning through community. Maybe they help organize local events, volunteer at shelters, join book clubs, or take classes just to keep learning things like astronomy, creative writing, or pottery. They build routines full of quiet beauty: fresh coffee in the morning, walking a rescue dog, sending letters to pen pals, and listening to music that stirs something inside them.

Some become mentors - not necessarily to family or children of their own, but to younger people in their fields or communities. They share wisdom and stories, and in doing so, leave a meaningful imprint on others‚Äô lives.

And then there are those who live many small lives in one, working different jobs in different places, exploring new careers, learning new skills even in their 50s or 60s. They might work on an organic farm one year, then become a yoga teacher the next, then study history or archaeology just for the wonder of it. They stay curious, and that curiosity keeps them alive inside.

They may not have someone to celebrate every birthday with, but they light a candle for themselves, bake something sweet, and make it a ritual of self-love. They may not have a partner to share a bed with, but they sleep peacefully, knowing they‚Äôve built a life on their own terms. Their lives are shaped not by what they‚Äôve lost or lacked, but by what they‚Äôve chosen to grow‚Ä¶

Sometimes I imagine a future where, if I don‚Äôt have anyone to care for or leave anything to, I‚Äôll spend my time traveling, picking up new jobs, learning new things, meeting new people. I will probably go back to school and study something just for the joy of it. Maybe even I‚Äôll become a therapist and help others cope with anticipatory grief. There‚Äôs a kind of freedom in having no social obligations or attachments left. I‚Äôll have more financial freedom too I guess. But still, deep down, I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôll handle it. The fear of losing my parents is something that I think will haunt me for the rest of my life, and the loneliness that follows is probably something that I will take with me to the grave.

I am more curious than concerned (a) because it is summer and there is no fire in the wood stove, and b) a whole lot of bad shit went down last week and I am fried.  I can not work up the energy to be concerned.)

But I stumble out of bed and down the stairs (the resident feline is a bit weirded out).  It is the battery backup to the internet router.  Fine, mute..  And this does not work.  Turn on lights, rub eyes, try mute again.  Bah.

So I unplug it. Ahhh sweet sweet bird chirps and bull frogs in the pond.  And then it squeals again.

At this point, the Man has stumbled downstairs to fix the problem or make coffee.  I am unclear on his intentions.  But, network geeks that we are, we decide to remove the battery.  This totally works, until we plug the router in again and it starts squealing.

First, the router was yelling because the battery had gone bad. Now it's yelling because it doesn't have a battery.  And the mute button doesn't work.  (Bad design people, bad design.)

We are pretty rural.  We depend on the internet for phone and txts as well as everything normal.  We also have a few acres, and being networking geeks, we've put in wi-fi extenders as far as we can.  

So, my solution is to actually make coffee, pout it into a travel mug, and head out to the far reaches of wi-fi extenders, and sit with chickens and bull frogs and mosquitos.   

The Man's solution is to take the broken battery down to the actual internet provider before it opens at 9 a.m.  He figured he could sit in the parking lot (with internet access) until they got there.  Or the hardware store opens at 7 a.m. and he can get the hose washers that I need.  And the food store opens at 8 a.m. ...  I sent him off with a travel mug of coffee.

People, it totally worked.  Because of summer heat, the installers are starting around 7 a.m.   He gets down there (45 min) and installers show up.  We know some of them (small, rural) and they hand the Man a new battery, and a donut, and send him on his way.   We will work out the paperwork later.

I‚Äôm an amateur web developer teaching myself how to code, and I‚Äôve been using ChatGPT a lot to learn and build small digital tools. My latest experiment is called MoreCoffeePlease.com ‚Äî a simple web app that prevents your computer from going to sleep.

It uses the Wake Lock API (or a silent video fallback) to keep the screen active during long tasks like downloads, reading, watching videos, etc. It runs entirely in the browser, no installs, no cookies, no tracking. Just click ‚ÄúStart‚Äù and your screen stays awake.

1lup7vu,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1lup7vu/does_hamilton_beach_12_cup_programmable_coffee/,Does Hamilton Beach 12 Cup Programmable Coffee Maker Deliver Great Brews Review?,"**Sleek Design That Fits Any Kitchen**  
The Hamilton Beach 46299 Programmable Coffee Maker immediately caught my eye with its sleek, modern design. The black finish with stainless steel accents feels premium and fits right into my kitchen setup. Its dimensions, 9.5""D x 11.4""W x 12.9""H, make it compact enough to sit on my countertop without hogging space. I love how the cord storage is cleverly integrated, keeping the counter clutter-free and tidy. A small thing, but when you‚Äôre battling for counter space, it makes a big difference. It strikes the balance between aesthetics and practicality.

**Easy Morning Routine with Wake-Up Ready Coffee**  
Having tested this machine routinely, I can confidently say one of its strongest features is the programmable timer that allows me to set it up 24 hours in advance. I programmed it the night before, and waking up to the aroma of freshly brewed coffee is truly a blessing. For a semi-automatic coffee maker, this feels like a luxury feature. On workdays, it saved me precious minutes fumbling around half-asleep trying to measure coffee grounds. The auto-start function has become such a game-changer for our household‚Äîit gets points for convenience alone.  

[Check Hamilton Beach 46299 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b06xp4dkgl/)

**Customizable Brew Strength Options**  
I‚Äôm a bit picky about my coffee‚Äôs strength, so the Select-A-Brew feature was perfect for tailoring the brew to my taste. There are three options: regular, bold, or a 1-4 cup setting for smaller, nuanced servings. My partner and I often switch between bold on busy mornings and regular when it‚Äôs a more relaxed start to the day. Testing the 1-4 cup strength for smaller batches resulted in excellent flavor without that watered-down aftertaste smaller batches sometimes produce. Coffee aficionados would appreciate this level of personalization.

**Upsides**  
Here‚Äôs what really stood out for me after multiple weeks of usage:  
- The programmable timer ensures your coffee is ready when you need it.  
- Customizable brew strength lets everyone enjoy their coffee the way they like it.  
- Quick first-cup feature with Auto Pause & Pour saves time and prevents spills.  
- Easy cleanup with dishwasher-safe carafe and filter basket.  
- Compact yet stylish design with efficient cord storage for organized counters.  

**Flaws**  
Despite loving much about this machine, there are a few aspects I struggled with:  
- The lid on the carafe sometimes drips when poured too quickly.  
- Bold brewing, while flavorful, does take a noticeably longer time which may annoy impatient coffee drinkers.  
- The water reservoir is not removable, making it slightly tedious to clean thoroughly.  

**Competitive Options**  
Comparing it to other products in the market, I found the Hamilton Beach Programmable Coffee Maker‚Äôs features stack up well for its price point. Against other budget-friendly models like the Mr. Coffee 12-Cup Coffee Maker, this machine offers better versatility in brew strength and programmable options. While the Black+Decker DLX1050B has a slightly larger carafe, it doesn't come close to this coffee maker in design and ease of use. Premium competitors like Keurig cater to pod-based coffee drinkers, but for drip coffee purists, Hamilton Beach keeps things straightforward and dependable with added flexibility. Though the water reservoir could‚Äôve been detachable like in some pricier options, this model still shines in terms of simplicity and no-frills usage.

**Worth Every Penny?**  
Speaking as someone who values quality at an affordable price, this coffee maker delivers excellent value for its features. You‚Äôre not just buying a simple drip coffee machine; this comes with programmable settings, adjustable brew strength, and thoughtful design elements like Auto Pause & Pour. Compared to pricier models, it doesn‚Äôt have all the bells and whistles, but for everyday coffee drinkers or families needing reliable functionality, this machine justifies its cost. For similar features, you‚Äôd likely pay more with other brands.

One thing I've noticed is that if I drink coffee, exercise, good protein intake, higher fiber intake, leaner carbs, that over time I notice some issues unless I keep my fat intake quite high.  In fact, over the past 5 years, when I was fit I stayed in really good shape getting more fat intake.  I got fatter when I lowered my fat intake, and did things like high fiber most days, coffee, leaner proteins (adding olive oil, just not that much), exercise, fasting, without thinking how they burn through energy.

My generalization would be, if you're a little too restrictive, high fiber, good protein intake, caffeine/coffee, exercise, and studies showing vegans do tend to oxidize fat more often, it makes me think there is a trend that active people with a good vegan diet are prone to higher fat oxidation.  And if fat isn't kept track of, you can run into issues over time, that has little to do with fat deposits in the body, moreso with much smaller cellular processes that need fat to insulate/function and so on.  Because fat oxidation is not some uniform process that just takes away from stored fat in your mid-section and so on.",6,1751982822.0,PlantBasedDiet,6,0.88,False

1lup4tt,https://i.redd.it/c9t12xd8onbf1.jpeg,so.. one month on e.. here‚Äôs my experience so far :),"(the photo is an edited pic of me sitting on the kitchen floor and scribbling in my notebook just cause i felt like making weird visuals idk??)

i started estrogen on the 9th of june 2025 in secret. no one irl knows apart from my best friend. my vial is in her house, and i walk there every monday to do my weekly injection of 8mg estradiol enanthate. the first injection i actually did at home, at the very desk im writing this from. it was scary, it was terrifying, it was euphoric and it was beautiful. im writing this as a way to journal for myself, and to share something that i feel i cant talk about with cis people. and also, i hope to be informative.

WEEK 1
i remember being on the phone with my boyfriend about 10 minutes after i did my dose, and screaming at the top of my lungs from joy. he was so supportive. and over the next 30 minutes, i felt the first effects come in. mental fog cleared, i felt.. joy.. for the first time. i was laughing louder than ever. i was truly happy. that same evening, i met up with my dad who told me if i do diy he will withdraw all the financial support for my transition he's been providing. which was devastating. but, alas, i kept going in secret.

over the following week, i experienced strange aches around my chest, my muscles as well as my illiac crest area began to hurt. my appetite doubled, and i had an urge to eat and eat and eat.. within a few days i noticed i was smiling more, i noticed random song lyrics were making me cry. i noticed i felt more easygoing, light on my feet, despite the still present dysphoria. things felt manageable for the first time. i noticed i began to sweat way less. the uh morning maintenance thing went away. my libido weirdly skyrocketed too. i was still dysphoric, but i was excited.

WEEK 2
the second week continued with the same chest aches around my armpits and such. i was grueling from my father's words, so my mood was down. he hasnt been in my life for a decade, and i thought him finally supporting my transition would be a chance for me to finally have a dad. and that seemed like its slipping away, which sucked. but again, i just kept moving.

i kept crying, honestly, everything made me cry. i felt very sensitive but i also felt very free. i began to style my hair, shave my body, i got more active on skincare. i felt a newfound motivation that kind of wasnt there before. of course, dysphoria was still kicking my ass. and since i wasnt able to dissociate anymore, i sort of had no option but to face it head on. which was pretty hard.. but i was managing somehow. i began to notice i smelled a little differently. i also noticed my areolas darkened significantly, my nipples doubled in size too, and began to actually hurt like mfers. i couldnt deny it anymore, it was happening. every day that passed, my body was slowly adopting a new form. its still scary to think about, but its beautiful. the first real physical change.. it just signaled to me that this flesh prison is finally becoming something i can live with.. possibly.

WEEK 3
in the third week, my mood began to shift towards positivity. emotions became hard to ignore, and things that ive buried for years surfaced. i felt elation at confronting myself, and actually.. being able to do so in a meaningful way. almost like my brain was supposed to be on E since birth. i felt so much more present, more alive, vigilant, cognizant of my surroundings. the world began to look clearer. my mind began to feel like my own. 

during this week, i noticed i undoubtedly have breast buds. my nips hurt as hell now, but it was undeniable. i was consistently shaving my legs these few weeks and this week i actually noticed the hair on my legs was growing a bit slower than before. my scalp hair was also shedding like 60% less in the shower, which was such a welcome thing. i began to also notice everything smelled more.. intense? my morning coffee. tobacco smoke from my cigarette. the dill i used to season the pasta i was making. the basil i put in the pesto last thursday. it all smelled so much more.. vivid, if that makes any sense. i didn‚Äôt really look any different. but these small signs that my very biology was moving closer to who i am has been a mood booser when i feel down. i still dont feel like myself. but i am trudging the path toward the day i might. 

and currently, im in week 4. my 4th injection was yesterday, and today im feeling alright. my buds are beginning to budge out and poke through my shirt, its quite weird to look at. despite my body still looking off in the mirror, i cant deny that my brain running on the right hormone is helping me feel at home in my skin, to a degree. i have so much internalized loathing around being trans, which sucks, but i feel its getting easier. i feel more like myself every day. i find new ways to affirm myself. its a tough journey, its full of suffering this trans thing. but it can be beautiful sometimes.

i want to urge anyone who knows theyre trans but is too scared to take the leap, dont wait. please dont wait. you deserve to feel at home in your skin too. estrogen or testosterone wont turn you into your perfect idealized image of yourself, but it will help you. love yourself enough to take the scariest leap of all. i did it in spite of the entire medical system and my entire family. its scary, its anxiety inducing. but i chose to save my own life. and i hope you do too.

i love you all :)

I never used this application, only through Google, but I read some posts and see some really good comments on Reddit, so I would like your advice and what do you think. 

I‚Äôm 23 and I feel like my life has been stuck. After finishing high school, I moved away from home to work in another city. It wasn‚Äôt easy, but it gave me a sense of independence. I found job quickly and started working hard. I have health problems so I can't stand on my feet longer than 4 hours, but I still managed to work for 8+ hours so I can make money and live by myself. My biggest wish was to go to the college. The main reason I went to another city is because I didn't like the situation at my home. I was depressed since I was 13 and always tought that my problem and bad health through childhood is the problem. 

Before applying exam before college I quit my job. Also my legs weren't good and I went through a lot of pain so I wanted a little bit of rest. Then I went without money and I asked mother to help me. She did, and sometimes gave me more than I even asked. Through that period I worked some part time jobs to make some money so I can spend it on myself (coffee, beer... I was never a big spender). I saw I will not be able to live and study in another city so I decided to return back home and go to the college in my hometown.

But since returning, everything has been a constant uphill battle (again, and a reminder why I left). 

My household is (what I think) dysfunctional. I live with my mother, grandfather, and aunt. My mother is anxious and emotionally dependent ‚Äî she can‚Äôt handle basic day-to-day things without fear. After work she usually lay and only talking we can do is about how something is or something bad is gonna happen. She doesn't eat in the kitchen, she eats in front of tv usually. She always repeated me since the day one I returned how much I costed her and how many mistakes did I made. She kept calling me everyday and sends me like 30 texts a day, When I started working (first week I came back), she told me I will not be able to do it, because of how hard my college is and that she can't go to pick me after work (can't walk after 8 hours shift, only if I drink pills for pain constantly). Then I quitted and started focusing on my degree. The problem is that my anxiety and depression was worse than ever now since I came back. My grandfather is old, bitter, and often emotionally dismissive or sarcastic. He always give you some toxis comment about how everyone is a thief or stupid and how bad everything around the world is. These is something all three of them shares. My aunt has schizophrenia, and although she's been stable recently, my childhood was marked by her aggressive episodes, listenings of her self talks and how everybody is a faggot or bitch, hallucinations, and thoughts about suicide. The house is quiet, cold ‚Äî no shared meals and no communication. I don't talk to nobody now, for two years because I want to keep my head clear but I am so tired because my mental health is in terrible state.

There‚Äôs no real structure. No one talks about something improtant or make plans, we just live, everbody for us selfs. Meals are random, responsibilities unclear, and I often go hungry because I don‚Äôt have income as a student. I‚Äôve tried talking to them. I‚Äôve tried cooking. But I simply can‚Äôt carry everything. Mother doesn't cook often because of the job, and we three are left on our own. Grandfather makes some meals, but almost every week something the same meals over and over (those meals doesn't include meat or vegetables, but rather something like pies or pancakes) and aunt makes meals but I really don't have appetite because her hygiene is not good (she doesn't wash her hands after using toailet etc.). I am the best fed when I cook the meals by myself. I even make myself some cakes, but the kitchen is usally always occupied and I resent to be around them. 

I‚Äôm stuck on my way to degree on university ‚Äî it‚Äôs been 3 years. I suffer from panic attacks before exams. I‚Äôve tried therapy. She told me that the best solution would be to move out. She is very empathic and understands everything that bothers me, that is why I like going to therapy. I try over and over again. But being in this house makes it almost impossible to focus, rest, or believe in myself. Everything is seen black, there is no laugh and everything different is seen as stupid... 

What makes it worse is the guilt. When I moved back, I needed financial help for a few months, and my mother helped me. Ever since, I‚Äôve been reminded of how I ‚Äúfailed‚Äù while I was away. There‚Äôs this unspoken pressure to repay, to redeem myself. Some days everything is okay, but every couple weeks I'm getting reminded about it. 

Every time I try to make a move ‚Äî get a job, find peace, create a boundary ‚Äî I get told to just ""deal with it"" or ""move out if it‚Äôs so bad."" But I don‚Äôt have the means. And I feel like a burden for even needing anything.

It‚Äôs exhausting. I lost so many summers trying to study so I can pass my exams, I unterstand the subjects, but I keep getting panic attacks, anxiety, headaches and pressure that if I don't do well, I will never leave this black hole. 

Now, I have a lot of subject to study for through summer. **My mental health is bad and I will still try to give my best, so please don't discourage me in that field, I know what I have to repeat and I will still try to do my best to pass this college year.** 

There is also positive aspects, my mother is also very caring and they are all good hearted persons at the end of the day, but everyday I also gets reminded that this is probably the reason Im fighting through depression. 

This is not about blaming anyone. I just want peace. I want a life where I can wake up without anxiety in my chest. Where I don‚Äôt feel guilty for existing. Where I can finally study, grow, and live. I know I was passive and I think my biggest problem is that I left the depression and anxiety to eat me alive, but I also want to change my life for the better after this summer and stand on my feet. 

Has anyone been through something similar?

Am I the problem and everything I said is normal and usual and I am overreacting? 

**TL;DR** I‚Äôm 23. I moved out to work after high school, but came back home to attend university in my hometown. Since returning, I‚Äôve struggled with mental health, guilt for needing help, and living in a highly dysfunctional household (mother with anxiety, grandfather who‚Äôs bitter, aunt with schizophrenia). I‚Äôve been stuck for 3 years trying to finish the subjects on first year of university. I know how to study and I don't have the problems about understanding the subjects. I get panic attacks before and during exams. I often go hungry, have no emotional support, and live in constant anxiety. Therapy helped, but I don‚Äôt have the resources to move out. I still want to succeed and change my life. Am I overreacting or is this as unhealthy as it feels?

Sorry for my bad english, greetings from Hungary from Peter! :)

Chapter 1
It was the third year of Savannah Reed‚Äôs marriage to Grayson Whitmore when their marriage license accidentally got soaked and ruined by a spilled cup of coffee.

Savannah brought the damaged license to the City Hall for a replacement.

The clerk typed a few keys in her computer, then suddenly looked up with a puzzled expression.

‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, according to our system‚Ä¶ your marital status is listed as single.‚Äù

Savannah froze, thinking she must have misheard.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs impossible. My husband and I got married right here three years ago.‚Äù

The clerk double-checked, her expression turning awkward.

‚ÄúThe system shows you as single, but Mr. Whitmore is registered as married‚Ä¶‚Äù

She paused.

‚ÄúHis listed spouse is someone named Claire Monroe. Do you know her?‚Äù

A sharp ringing filled Savannah‚Äôs mind, leaving only a shrill ringing in her ears.

Everyone knew Savannah and Grayson had been childhood sweethearts.

She was the girl he had once called the light of his life‚Äîthe one he used to protect with quiet devotion.

While Claire Monroe?

Claire was just a stand-in Grayson had found while Savannah was studying abroad because he missed her so much.

Still gripping the ruined license, Savannah numbly got into her car.

Her phone buzzed.

It was a message from Grayson.

‚ÄúBaby, I skipped out on a billion-dollar deal just to be home early. Got your favorite rose tartlets and strawberry cakes. I miss you so much‚Äîdo you miss me?‚Äù

Savannah stared at the message.

And then, suddenly, she laughed.

The laugh rolled out of her chest like something broken.

And as she laughed, tears spilled silently down her cheeks.

For three years, he had asked her the same question every day.

Had showered her with love and affection.

But behind her, he had already become another woman‚Äôs husband.

Memories flashed through her mind‚Äî

Grayson, at thirteen, breaking his arm falling from a tree to retrieve her kite.

Yet he still handed her the kite with a smile, saying, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt cry, Sav. It doesn‚Äôt even hurt.‚Äù

At fifteen, waiting in the rain all night beneath her room, just to be the first to wish her happy birthday.

At eighteen, kneeling under a sky of fireworks in a rented amusement park, whispering, ‚ÄúMarry me when I‚Äôm twenty-two, okay?‚Äù

At the airport, the day she left for college abroad, eyes red-rimmed as he pinned her to the wall. ‚ÄúTwo years. That's all time I'm giving you. When time's up, I'm flying over to take you back.‚Äù

During those two years, they video-called almost every night.

Once, she was buried in deadlines and missed his calls for three days.

When she finally reached out, she found out he‚Äôd been hospitalized with alcohol poisoning.

In the hospital, he looked into the camera, eyes bloodshot.

‚ÄúBaby, I can‚Äôt live without you.‚Äù

She had coaxed him gently, ‚ÄúJust a little longer. I‚Äôm coming back soon.‚Äù

When she returned, she hadn‚Äôt told him. Wanted to surprise him.

But when she opened the private room at The Brambleton Club, she saw him kissing another woman‚Äîdeeply, desperately.

That woman had the same soft features. The same gentle smile. She looked almost like Savannah.

Her purse dropped to the ground with a thud. She turned and walked out without a word.

Grayson chased after her like a madman. She wouldn‚Äôt answer his calls, so he stood in the rain outside her apartment, texting nonstop. Begging.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not what you think!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt let me come see you‚ÄîI missed you too much. She was just a replacement‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI swear it was only kissing, nothing more!‚Äù

‚ÄúSav, I‚Äôm sorry‚ÄîI love you so much it‚Äôs driving me insane‚Ä¶‚Äù

He stood there for three days and nights in the pouring rain. He collapsed from a high fever that turned into pneumonia. Even after being rushed to the hospital, he refused to leave.

Only then did her heart soften, and she forgave him. After that, he treated her with the same devotion as before.

Until after their wedding, when Savannah noticed a new assistant around Grayson. Claire Monroe.

The girl he had sworn he‚Äôd sent away.

He explained again, ‚ÄúHer parents are sick. She couldn‚Äôt handle being away from home. She begged to come back here‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúShe applied for the assistant position‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt even know it was her.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs actually pretty good at the job, went through all the screening rounds. I couldn‚Äôt just fire her.‚Äù

So Savannah tolerated it. Again.

Until one day, she looked up and realized the joke was on her.

By the time her car pulled into the driveway at Everpine Estates, Savannah‚Äôs tears had dried.

She inhaled deeply. Just as she reached for the front door, she heard voices from inside the house‚ÄîGrayson and his friend, Logan.

‚ÄúI just saw Claire at the hospital,‚Äù Logan said. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs fine. Just a few scrapes. You can relax and stay home with Savannah.‚Äù

Grayson‚Äôs voice came next. He was stretched out on the couch, black shirt unbuttoned at the collar, long legs crossed.

‚ÄúYou know the rule,‚Äù he said coldly. ‚ÄúNo smoking in this house. Savannah hates the smell.‚Äù

Logan chuckled. ‚ÄúMan, you are whipped.‚Äù

Then, more seriously: ‚ÄúI still don‚Äôt get it. You're so obsessed with Savannah. Why‚Äôd you even marry Claire? Be honest‚Äîwas she really just a replacement?‚Äù

The room went quiet for a second.

Then Grayson‚Äôs voice, low and hoarse: ‚ÄúWhat if I do?‚Äù

‚ÄúI used to think once Savannah came back, I‚Äôd forget all about Claire.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut after she left, I kept dreaming about her.‚Äù

‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt tolerate anymore. I brought her back. Gave her a job. Kept her close.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt live without Savannah‚Ä¶ but I can‚Äôt let go of Claire either.‚Äù

‚ÄúSavannah gets all my above-board love. Claire can only stay in the shadows, and I'll give her a title as compensation. That‚Äôs fair, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

Logan exhaled. ‚ÄúYou know if she discovers this, even you bleed out at her feet she still walks away without looking back.

Grayson was silent.

‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll just make sure she never finds out.‚Äù

Savannah stood frozen on the doorstep. Her blood felt like ice in her veins.

She thought she‚Äôd collapse. Break down. But the tears didn‚Äôt come.

Because pain like this wasn‚Äôt loud. It was silent. It clawed a hole in your heart and left it beating anyway.

She remembered that morning, he had kissed her forehead before heading out the door.

Every time he came home drunk, he‚Äôd hold her tightly and whisper, ‚ÄúBaby, I can‚Äôt live without you.‚Äù

He used to warm her frozen fingers with his own, pressing her hand to his chest. ‚ÄúThis heart beats only for you.‚Äù

And it was all a lie.

The entire time she was trying to understand, to forgive, to believe in his love.

Now, she saw the truth: he'd just fallen head over heels for two women simultaneously.

He never intended to choose.

He wanted both.

Fine.

Grayson was afraid she‚Äôd find out?

Then she‚Äôd show him what she will do.

Savannah turned and walked away.

1luozvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoweredByExperience/comments/1luozvb/reveal_the_best_electric_kettle_for_pour_over/,Reveal the Best Electric Kettle for Pour Over Coffee Cuisinart,"After using the Cuisinart GK-1, I can confidently say that this digital gooseneck kettle has carved out its place in my daily coffee and tea rituals. Right out of the box, it feels solid and well-made, with a sleek matte black stainless-steel design that whispers ‚Äúclassy‚Äù and doesn‚Äôt shout for attention on the countertop. As someone who absolutely loves pour-over coffee, the precision gooseneck spout is a game changer. It pours with such accuracy that even my clumsy hands can control the flow like a barista in a hip coffee shop. The inclusion of a digital temperature control and display is not fluff‚Äîit‚Äôs ridiculously useful. I often switch between teas, some requiring boiling water and others needing lower temperatures, so having customizability ranging from 140¬∞F to 212¬∞F is heaven-sent. The kettle heats quickly, letting me start my brew without impatiently tapping my fingers. 

**Performance and Practicality**  
Using this kettle daily has revealed some strong points about its performance. The 1200-watt heat-up is surprisingly fast, outpacing my old kettle by a significant margin. There's also a 30-minute keep-warm feature, which might not seem like much initially but makes a huge difference when you're a parent juggling kids and coffee on busy mornings. What struck me is the ergonomic handle; it stays cool and comfortable, and pouring is both smooth and effortless. I've never spilled a drop‚Äînot something I could say about my other kettles. The 1-liter capacity is perfect for my needs, whether it‚Äôs brewing a couple of large cups of coffee or getting enough hot water ready for a tea session with friends. Another bonus: it operates quietly, unlike some others that sound like a jet engine.

**Favorable Attributes**  
- Custom temperature controls from 140¬∞F to 212¬∞F  
- Precision gooseneck spout ensures an even pour  
- Fast heating due to 1200 watts of power  
- Keeps water warm for up to 30 minutes  
- Modern aesthetics and durable stainless-steel build  

[Check Cuisinart GK-1 price on Amazon.](https://techieupdate.com/p/b08kct8t6c/)

**User Experience: Convenience Meets Sleek Design**  
The touchpad base is intuitive, featuring easy-to-use controls and a clear front-facing digital display. It doesn‚Äôt feel overwhelming like some overly high-tech appliance‚Äîjust simple and functional. Cleaning is straightforward because of its stainless-steel matte finish, which doesn‚Äôt show smudges or water stains as much as glossy coatings typically do. However, it‚Äôs not dishwasher safe, requiring a hand-wash. That‚Äôs slightly inconvenient on lazy days, but nothing deal-breaking. Its lightweight design, at just one pound, also impressed me during setup, making relocation around the kitchen a breeze.  

**Drawbacks**  
Not everything about the kettle is flawless. There are some rough edges, metaphorically speaking.  
- It‚Äôs on the pricier side compared to basic electric kettles.  
- Lack of an audible signal when water reaches the desired temperature can make multitasking tricky.  
- While the keep-warm function is effective, I do wish it lasted longer than 30 minutes.  

**Texture and Taste Impact**  
The way it allows water to flow consistently from the spout made a visible difference in the quality of my pour-over coffee. Compared to cheaper standard kettles, this one nailed the blooming process. My tea enthusiasts in the family also noted how different types of tea‚Äîoolong, green, black‚Äîhad fuller flavors due to the precise water temps. Setting the correct temperature felt less like guesswork and more like brewing perfection. 

**Product Contenders**  
Within the world of electric gooseneck kettles, it definitely has competitors like the Fellow Stagg EKG and the Bonavita Digital Variable Temperature Kettle. The Fellow Stagg is known for its elegant craftsmanship and finer temperature settings, but its premium price tag can make it unattainable for some. The Bonavita, on the other hand, is more budget-friendly but lacks some of the sophistication and durability of the Cuisinart GK-1. Where this model excels is in its balance of sleek design, high functionality, and practical cost‚Äîit hits the sweet spot that bridges features and affordability better than most rivals. However, if silent operation and longer keep-warm features are must-haves, it might not be the perfect fit for everyone.  

**Affordable Quality**  
Considering all its features (quick heat-up, customizable temperatures, excellent pouring control) and comparing it to pricier alternatives, I‚Äôd say this kettle offers solid value for its price point. Yes, it does sit in the upper mid-range category, but the functionality justifies it. If you‚Äôre someone who simply needs boiling water with no bells and whistles, this might feel like overkill. However, for people invested in precision brewing, it‚Äôs worth the splurge. Whether you‚Äôre perfecting a pour-over method or steeping delicate teas, the investment pays off.

1luoz3j,https://www.reddit.com/r/MoneyDiariesACTIVE/comments/1luoz3j/33yo_software_engineer_on_110k_in_berlin_germany/,"33yo Software Engineer on ‚Ç¨110k in Berlin, Germany","**Money Diary**

Title: I am 33 years old, make ‚Ç¨110,000, live in Berlin, Germany, work as a Software Engineer remotely for a US company. My partner is also 33 and makes ‚Ç¨75,000 in a different tech job as of the last 6 months.

We are married and share all our finances, although we decide how to distribute our assets across accounts based on what we perceive to be tax-optimal (I hold US citizenship, so we invest in his name to avoid having to report on US taxes). Currently our tax class is 4/4, but we were on 3/5 during the 1.5 years my partner was unemployed after moving to Germany to be with me - this gave me ‚Ç¨800 more in net income. This was a very stressful time for us but we were very fortunate that we had savings and our costs scaled well (he moved into the apartment I was already paying for on my own), although we really budgeted a lot of fun things out in that time. But we were still able to save, just significantly less.

**Section One: Assets and Debt**¬†

Retirement Balance - USD$185,000, varying depending on the day and Trump's current shenanigans. I worked in the US until I was 28 and contributed to retirement savings there and have continued contributing to my IRA from abroad ($7k a year this year). I try to contribute on or around January 1, as time in the market always beats out timing the market. My partner has some ‚Ç¨100k saved up from before we were married.

Savings - ‚Ç¨30k very conservative cash buffer, ‚Ç¨25k investments (Trade Republic, self-balanced Bogle portfolio) and counting.

Credit card debt - none.

Student loan debt - none. This is my biggest privilege. My grandparents set up a trust to pay out university fees so while I worked in college and my parents were able to help me with rent, my tuition was covered.

**Section Two: Income**

**Income Progression:**¬†I've been working in my field for 8 years, my starting salary was $100,000 in San Francisco, CA after doing a bootcamp. Salaries in Europe are much lower so I took a pay cut to move here, but my salary is above average here (median salary in Berlin is ‚Ç¨42k, median engineering salary is \~‚Ç¨70-80k).

**Main Job Monthly Take Home:**

Rounding all these numbers to the nearest 50-100.

Pre-tax / brutto salary is ‚Ç¨9200.

‚Ç¨5300 monthly take-home, after taxes (‚Ç¨2400) and mandatory deductions: social security (‚Ç¨750), unemployment insurance (‚Ç¨100), health insurance (‚Ç¨470), nursing insurance (‚Ç¨130). I am on public health insurance because I believe in the system and we also hope to have kids, so it should scale better. If we want extra treatments our public insurance does not cover, we can pay out-of-pocket (although thus far we've only done this for dental cleanings).

Partner's monthly take-home after taxes and mandatory deductions is ‚Ç¨3800.

No other income other than investment dividends and interest, which we do have to pay taxes on each year.

**Section Three: Expenses**

**Monthly expenses**

‚Ç¨2200 household discretionary spending - We keep a STRICT budget for our personal spending: at the end of each month, when we get paid, we transfer ‚Ç¨900 into each of our spending accounts for ALL non-fixed expenses (groceries, shopping, fun), ‚Ç¨400 into a special account to save for travel or unexpected expenses, ‚Ç¨1300 for monthly fixed expenses, ‚Ç¨200 buffer for our annual recurring expenses and the rest into our investments (\~‚Ç¨5400). If we plan a vacation, anything over what has accumulated in our travel budget gets taken out of our cash savings and backfill to maintain about ‚Ç¨30k at all times. All the remainder goes into long-term investments for retirement. We are lucky that we don't have to think too much about an extra ‚Ç¨100 cost that may come up here and there, because we have a lot of leeway.

When we have had big purchases (like paying for an upcoming holiday, or buying a piece of furniture), we restrict our personal budgets down to ‚Ç¨700 for a month or two afterwards.

Rent: ‚Ç¨615. We really lucked out on this one - it was the only flat I got of the several hundred I desperately applied for when I moved here during the pandemic (housing market here is challenging). We live in a 50 sq m (\~500 sq ft) 1-bed in the equivalent of, like, Brooklyn. The flat is rent-controlled, owned by one of the big companies that own 80% of Berlin real estate, and I have been living here for 4 years. My partner moved in 2 years ago when we got married; before that, it was just mine. It's kind of small for two people and a cat, but it has been HUGE in allowing us to build wealth, especially when one of us has been unemployed. We don't plan to move until we have a kid that is 2-3 years old.

Bills:

* ‚Ç¨11 a month for renters‚Äô union. We've never had to use this but it provides you with free legal advice if you ever have an issue with your landlord.
* ‚Ç¨55 a month for electricity. We select this price based on their estimate - you pay monthly, they check your meter once a year, and then they either ask for more money or refund you the difference depending on how much you used.
* ‚Ç¨72 a month for gas. Ditto above. We upped this this year because end of last year we had to pay an extra ‚Ç¨110.
* ‚Ç¨58 a month for wifi. We got the first year free though and are now approaching year 3 on this contract.
* ‚Ç¨15 a month x2 = ‚Ç¨30 a month for cell phone service
* ‚Ç¨58 x2 = ‚Ç¨116 for public transportation (Deutschlandticket)
* ‚Ç¨18 a month for the mandatory TV tax (Rundfunkbeitrag)

\_\_\_\_\_ TOTAL \~‚Ç¨1000 in necessary fixed expenses

Subscriptions (mostly mine; all my partner's hobbies are sports):

* ‚Ç¨85 a month for ceramics studio membership (I am on the fence about whether this is worth it atm)
* ‚Ç¨29 a month for a coffee bean subscription from my favorite roastery
* $20 a month for Spotify (family membership, my nuclear family in the US is also using it)
* ‚Ç¨17 a month for N26 Metal
* ‚Ç¨49 a month for gym membership
* ‚Ç¨45 for my partner‚Äôs subsidized USC (like Classpass) membership through his work

\_\_\_\_\_\_ TOTAL \~‚Ç¨250 in non-necessary recurring expenses

Pet expenses come out of our personal budgets as part of our groceries (food, litter, toys, supplies) or travel budget if we require petsitting. We got rid of pet insurance last year because it was quite expensive (‚Ç¨380 a year) and we never used it. We will pay out-of-pocket if we require medical procedures in the future.

**Annual expenses**

* ‚Ç¨92 for comprehensive liability insurance for both of us (this is very German)
* ‚Ç¨61 for house contents insurance up to ‚Ç¨25k
* ‚Ç¨250 for legal insurance for work issues (in case either of our companies decides to fire us for no reason - this is a recent investment watching the recent movements in tech)
* ‚Ç¨382 for egg freezing - I did one round 3 years ago for ‚Ç¨4500 total. This is the annual fee to keep them on ice.
* $60 annual subscription for 1password family. I am struggling to get my parents to use it but I think it is important.
* ‚Ç¨1500-1800 on filing taxes in the US and Germany. This is honestly the worst. I do usually get 1100-1400 back from the German Finanzamt the following year though (accountant fees are partially tax deductible).
* ‚Ç¨1000-1500 on botox - Beauty expenses like skincare products or haircare come out of my personal budget. However, I also get botox 3-4 times a year. This is my huge bougie spend but at the moment we can swing it and it feels worth it.
* ‚Ç¨500-2000 family support.
* ‚Ç¨500-1000 donations - we usually donate $100-200 to big climate disasters in the US :( and various causes throughout the year
* We do probably spend ‚Ç¨5-8k on travel each year encompassing usually 1-2 big trips centered around friends' weddings and a couple trips to my partner's hometown of London (where we frequently outspend our monthly budget but stay with his family for free).

**Money Diary**

I simply cannot be assed to actually tally up all our expenses! I can say that my partner is better at budgeting without girl math - he seems to just spend and always have a bit of his ‚Ç¨900 left at the end of the month.

But my monthly breakdown is usually something like:

* ‚Ç¨300-350 on groceries (my partner usually spends around the same)
* ‚Ç¨150-200 on eating out (mostly coffees; I try to avoid meeting friends at restaurants more than a few times a month as it adds up really quickly). This includes my daily croissant hehehe
* ‚Ç¨100-300 on shopping (like skincare, clothes, small things for the flat. I usually allow myself one big purchase a month and/or a couple smaller ones, like I might buy some gym leggings and a candle, or make a skincare order and buy some new napkins and a plant. I also buy at least 1-2 books a month.)
* ‚Ç¨100-300 miscellaneous entertainment.

It all has to come out of the ‚Ç¨900, so these things play off of each other. If I shop too much then I can't go out with friends for dinner.

Our current savings goal for the year is ‚Ç¨35k - this gives us leeway for travel and unexpected expenses like having to buy a new phone or laptop for a family member or upgrading/fixing something in our flat.

The biggest thing enabling me to hit my financial goals and build security and stability is having married someone who is on the same page and always open to having conversations about division of labor in the household and about finances. There are lots of little day-to-day compromises, and any expenses that don't come out of our personal budgets have to be agreed upon. On dates, we take turns :) We both believe strongly in living within our means and, whenever either of us gets a raise, we allow ourselves one fun purchase and then just up our savings.

**Mom**: Hi, good afternoon üòò I‚Äôm home. I won‚Äôt be able to call today. But tomorrow I‚Äôd like to talk to you a little bit. Maybe I‚Äôll call in my lunch break, from 1 pm to 2pm. A kiss üòò I like you a lot

**Me**: Good afternoon. We‚Äôll talk tomorrow or Wednesday. Kisses üòò

**Today**

**Mom**: Good afternoon üòò. I‚Äôm in my lunch break until 2pm, if you want to call üòò

**Me**: Good afternoon. Yes, I know, you told me yesterday. I‚Äôll call another day. Kisses

**Mom**: Did I do something that might have displeased you? I feel you ‚Äúcold‚Äù towards me‚Ä¶A kiss

**Me**: I‚Äôm not feeling very well and that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt want to talk, but to answer your question, yes, certain comments and attitudes of yours towards me haven‚Äôt always been the best. To give you a recent example, in our last phone conversation, you telling me, giggling, that my life is boring didn‚Äôt seat well with me. There are other examples that I could give you, but anyway, it comes down to comments you make sometimes that are kind of insensitive.

**Mom**: I didn‚Äôt mean to say anything in that fashion that you interpreted it as, I‚Äôm sad ‚òπ

**Me**: What would be an alternative interpretation to that sort of remark? What if I said the same to you?

**Mom**: You should know‚Ä¶When you think it‚Äôs worth talking to me you know that I‚Äôm here‚Ä¶A kiss. I wish you all the best <3

**Me**: No, I‚Äôm asking you: what was your intention behind a comment like that? Do you remember saying it?

**Mom**: I thought we were both in on a joke. I never thought that it would be interpreted in that way. I didn‚Äôt even mean to say anything like that‚Ä¶

**Me**: What if I told you the same, would you interpret it as a joke?

**Mom**: I‚Äôm sorry, but I don‚Äôt understand‚Ä¶how could I say something to you with anything less than a good intention? Think about it‚Ä¶

To you or your sister‚Ä¶

**Me**: If I said to you ‚Äúyour life is boring ahah‚Äù how would you feel? Think about it‚Ä¶

**Mom**: This doesn‚Äôt seem to me to be the best way to get a point across. When we talk face to face‚Ä¶It wasn‚Äôt with that sort of intention. I just got very hurt. I consider you a daughter-friend. We will not continue with this text exchange. I can‚Äôt. A kiss, be well ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π

**Me**: (responding to a previous text) That was another one, I invited you for a coffee, you were supposed to tell me yes or no, but you just ignored me completely during the weekend and then you decided to call me in a day I was working, just 15 min before my shift‚Ä¶when I‚Äôve told you many times that‚Äôs not the best time to call‚Ä¶

**Mom**: The message I always want to convey to you is that you‚Äôre a person with merit and with a distinctive personality.

**Me**: (responding to her saying that she‚Äôs very hurt) Not only your feelings matter in a daughter-mother relationship or a friendship‚Ä¶you know that, don‚Äôt you? I just ask you to have more empathy and respect for me because I‚Äôve always had plenty for you and I‚Äôve always been on your side.

**Mom**: When you think you‚Äôre capable of listening to me, call me.

**Me**: Kisses. And I love you, even though you sometimes hurt me <3

To summary -
I had a 2nd Tri miscarriage in January 
Started trying again in March 
Didn't ovulate until May despite trying all the things my body was trying to handle the trauma of everything. 
Finally BFP in July after almost exactly 6 months and it being my original due date the same weekü•π

Was having weird spotting before periods and such that I learned was likely low progesterone. 
Learned about pregnenolone supplement-research this on your own it's a tricky one. 
Started taking pregnenolone along with camu camu (natural vit c source - vit c is supposed to help lengthen luteal phase. Also took it with Vitex berry (important to note for progesterone support)
Also important to not that you want to take this sup at night and be ""calm"" after in hopes of allowing it to turn into progesterone and not cortisol since it is the precursor for both. 

Swiss water decaf coffee instead of regular coffee - lower cortisol 
As much pomegranate juice as I wanted
1/2 a pill of mucinex a day for the 4 days around ovulation
Eating enough high protein whole food meals - I tend to not want to eat when stressed or eat crappy
Regular prenatal vitamins and plenty of magnesium and good sleep
Spending time outside daily
And most importantly truly surrendering the Ttc journey to God to the best of my ability-easier said than done but He takes the weight of it all if you let him.

Fast forward about 9 months (at this point he‚Äôs met all my friends and family and I‚Äôve met his family when they visit from Europe) we had a bad argument because I got mad he bought concert tickets for him and his friend for his friends birthday that he hasn‚Äôt seen since he left Europe when was 5. But I got so mad at this and I said very mean things to him such as ‚ÄúThis is why you are ugly and I was only dating u because I felt bad‚Äù , ‚ÄúMy guy friend would never do this‚Äù , ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in love with my guy friend anyway‚Äù , and I even told him to kill himself. I have a bad history of lashing out because my parents were not the best parents to me. But I‚Äôve said some harsh things to him before when I was mad but he always forgave me but this time he snapped. He got up and started to yell at me and told me how he always buys what I wants whenever I ask and does so much for me. He even drove over to my house high because I was sad and didn‚Äôt feel like driving. I must say this time I was scared and left. He didn‚Äôt text or call me for 3 days until I texted him apologizing but ever since he‚Äôs been so dry with me and always makes an excuse not to see me. 
He said he would meet me for coffee. But I have no idea how to bring this up and talk to him?

Anyway, I‚Äôm still really focused on one hour at a time. Crazy how we count hours, I‚Äôve never had to do that with anything else in my life. But thinking ahead, no thoughts of slowing down now!

I can purchase cheap edibles from Tilray Brands if I desired that as well. Safe product quality checked and not have to worry about fentynal or some other dangerous substance.  That's not what I wanted however. I wanted a sparking drink with flavor plus added CBD and THC. That's going to run you a bit more but no different in price then a beer at a bar. In some cases you pay more for the beer or craft beer depending where you are. A Starbucks coffee will run you 5-6 bucks for a basic add a flavor and you you can top 7 bucks easily. 

You don't compare a half inch edible with thc in price to a large can of sparkling beverage. Tilray offers edibles far cheaper then what I paid for those cans which I thought were reasonable. 

With a beverage you're not just paying for the thc.  You're getting far more product of an enjoyable sparkling drink compared to a gummie. ",7,1751981241.0,Roaringtilray,3,0.89,False

Previous MOTs and services when I lived up in town have been a breeze - drop the car off and walk home or to the station to commute. Usually pick up the car at the end of the day, or the following morning.

No public transport, and a taxi home would cost ¬£50+ each way.

Do garages let you sit in and wait while they're doing the MOT and service? And how long is it likely to take - I know its as long as a piece of string, but my car is fairly new and in great nick, no issues whatsoever on any previous MOTs or services. I'm thinking to just bring a book and a packed lunch, but are you allowed to just hang around in a waiting room? It's also the only car in the household and we haven't been here long enough to make friends with someone who'd be able to pick me up, so I'm worrying about basically being stranded.

1luoarh,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1luoarh/i_am_building_a_cloud_ide_using_flutter_backend/,"I am building a cloud IDE using Flutter, backend on Google Cloud.","# Meet *Cortado*

Cortado is the cloud IDE that I am currently building using the Flutter/Dart stack. On the backend, compute resources are provisioned using Google Kubernetes Engine.

# Why Another Cloud IDE?

Personally, I've tried many different platforms ‚Äî GitHub Codespaces, Replit, Gitpod Classic, etc. ‚Äî because I tend to work from different locations and devices. However, as powerful as those tools are, I find them quite pricey because they offer fixed CPU and RAM configurations and charge a flat monthly price regardless of my usage.

With Cortado, I‚Äôm aiming to keep bills as low as possible, charging users for exactly how much compute, memory, and storage they use. And they can choose extremely specific machine configurations too, opting for GPUs if needed as well.

# What Are Some Key Features?

The features are summarised and explained below, but can also be found on the landing page: [https://cortado.obsivision.com](https://cortado.obsivision.com/).

### Low Profit Margin

I‚Äôve tried to keep the profit margin extremely low for Cortado, since I understand the pain that other devs feel when they have to pay through the nose to simply have a workspace on the cloud. Before an environment is created, users can see the compute prices per hour, estimated bill before markup, and the actual billing price. I hope that this transparency can ease any doubts about how much I am marking up the prices. Furthermore, a significant portion of the revenue generated from the markup go back into paying for web hosting, funding the development of other features, and more coffees.

### Jobs

Sometimes, your environment has low compute requirements, but some tasks (such as builds or ML training) need higher compute. For this, you can create a *job*, which spawns a clone of your environment and allows you to reconfigure the compute for the new environment. You can specify a command to be executed in the new environment, and Cortado will automatically merge the final state of the environment back into your old one, before deleting the newly-created environment. Thus, you gain temporary access to higher compute without administrative overhead or high bills.

### Realtime Resource Monitoring

Cortado allows you to monitor the CPU-seconds of compute, GB-seconds of RAM/storage consumed so that you always know where your bill is currently sitting. You can also set hard budget limits to prevent runaway processes from leaving you destitute.

### Interface

Only the VSCode interface is supported for now, since Cortado starts the code server on the backend and connects to it via Remote Tunnels.

# What‚Äôs Next for the Project?

If you‚Äôre interested, you can visit [https://cortado.obsivision.com](https://cortado.obsivision.com/) which contains a registration form. Even if you‚Äôre semi-interested and don‚Äôt want to sign up for a free trial, you could leave some feedback on the form as well. I would love to hear what features users would be interested in, as well as any concerns you may have. A DM to this account or an email to project.cortado@gmail.com would be more than welcome. Maybe you don‚Äôt have any feedback or concerns to raise, but instead just want to chat about the product or the process ‚Äî I‚Äôd be more than happy to hear your thoughts!",1,1751980574.0,SideProject,0,1.0,False

*FRANK TYSZKA RUINED MY DOOR*

*Then go to all his campaign events and display it prominently between him and any cameras there to cover the event.*

>OOP: I like the cut of your jib



**Mini Update from OOP**

Update: for anyone interested, I got a response from him on Facebook. He was apologetic and offered to send someone out to clean it. I agree that it likely just got wet when it rained. Ultimately the purpose this served was to show me how he‚Äôd respond. His opponent, Cassetti has been in office for years and is what you‚Äôve come to expect from a typical Republican. Denials, insults, screams. (Look him up on Facebook at some point, he‚Äôs literally just copying dump now, in fact, apparently he recently went on a tirade on Facebook calling the people in Ansonia ghetto trash and that they don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs good for them. It got so bad the news actually camped out at city hall until he couldn‚Äôt hide anymore) Frank on the other hand offered to help, even though he ultimately did nothing wrong, just a bad situation arising out of the randomness of life. He‚Äôs got my vote.



**Update - 2 days later**



Full story on my profile, but the quick and dirty is-Frank came by and cleaned my door. It genuinely seems like it actually did get glued to it, and, well‚Ä¶more details on the other post, but it really is very possible someone did this intentionally, and for less than savory reasons. The door is still slightly damaged, but this isn‚Äôt the end, and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be infuriated with the ending, I know I‚Äôm not currently.

So, aside from the age gap which is a lot sometimes, she is also very different than me. I am content alone and happy in my introvert space at home. She is extroverted, always finds herself in crisis and can just be a lot of drama. Recently she has gotten into a relationship with someone who sort of amplifies all her qualities I don‚Äôt care for. They fight constantly, she lets him dictate everything she does and she even does that to a point that it‚Äôs decided what she and I were both doing, because we were together and out and he told her to go home and we‚Äôd ridden together so it made it so I had gotten ready for nothing and had no say, it was a whole thing. This is just to sort of establish a pattern of behavior is why I mention it at all.



So, he also controls who she is allowed to spend time with so there‚Äôs an expectation of me being around if she is going to be around anyone who isn‚Äôt a female or not straight because he‚Äôs a long distance relationship. I disagree with all of this, and more. They also when they are together, they go through each other‚Äôs phones regularly which I guess if it works for them that‚Äôs fine. I think it‚Äôs weird, but whatever it‚Äôs not my relationship.¬†



Now, for the issues that bother me the most: She has started going through my phone without permission, reading my texts with my friends and tells me it‚Äôs okay that I vent about her relationship because of the stuff I‚Äôve mentioned above that I just have to put up with. She also doesn‚Äôt have a job, and whenever we do go do something we take my car. She uses my money for coffees or food or whatever when we go out and has gotten to a point where she doesn‚Äôt even really ask. And I know she doesn‚Äôt have many other people in life and puts a lot of her mental well being on me but it‚Äôs starting to weigh on me and I have more than one person in my life telling me she is just a manipulative person and I‚Äôm starting to see it I think.



I know this message might need some clarifying on points, I‚Äôm processing everything all at once and that‚Äôs really hard when I‚Äôve had such a weirdly close relationship with her for so long. And I am torn, I really don‚Äôt know what I need to do.

We‚Äôre working on a 2D Metroidvania game inspired by Hollow Knight, and we‚Äôre currently on the lookout for people who are just as passionate about games as we are. The project is already well into development, and most of the core game mechanics are already done. I‚Äôve been handling most of the programming myself, but what we‚Äôre really missing now is the visual magic to bring everything to life.

That‚Äôs where you might come in.

We're mainly looking for animators and artists right now ‚Äì especially folks who can help create character animations, enemies, environmental elements, and basically give the world the look and feel it deserves. If you already have some character or environment assets lying around that you think could fit, I‚Äôd be happy to check them out and load them into the engine. We‚Äôre flexible and open to styles, so don‚Äôt be afraid to share your vision.

The game is combat-focused with a bit of platforming, dark fantasy aesthetic, and exploration-heavy gameplay. Think responsive movement, satisfying hits, hidden secrets, and a world that reacts to the player. Right now, everything is mostly blocks and placeholders, but the mechanics are working fine ‚Äì dash, slash, damage, jump, AI, etc. Now we just need someone who can help give it soul with animation and visual flair.

Aside from that, we‚Äôre also looking for streamers, gamers, memers, cosplayers, or honestly anyone who‚Äôs fun to hang out with and wants to be part of something creative. If you‚Äôre good at hyping stuff up, sharing memes, making the Discord server more alive, or just chilling and testing out early builds, that helps more than you think. Even if you don‚Äôt have dev skills, we welcome you.

We want to build a fun, close-knit team. We‚Äôre indie, small, and running things on passion and coffee. It‚Äôs not a paid gig upfront, but rev-share is on the table if the project makes money. The goal is to actually release something we‚Äôre proud of, not just endlessly prototype forever. So if you want to help make something cool and maybe build your portfolio or skills while doing it, let‚Äôs talk.

If you‚Äôre even a little interested or curious, just message me. Doesn‚Äôt have to be formal. Send your work if you‚Äôve got it or just tell me what you‚Äôre into. Let‚Äôs chat.

Thanks for reading and hope to hear from you soon!

We've all been there - investing time, money, and sweat into an idea that initially seemed like a winner, only to realize it's not resonating with the market. Our case study is a prime example of this. Meet ""Flux Capacitor,"" a startup founded by two passionate engineers who set out to revolutionize the world of clean energy. Equipped with a groundbreaking product and an impressive team, they raised a decent amount of seed funding and even landed a few high-profile clients.

However, despite their initial success, the team soon hit a wall. The product's complexity and high cost frightened off potential customers, and the market seemed to be moving in a different direction. As the days turned into weeks, the team found themselves stuck, uncertainty growing with each passing day.

Pivoting was the only way forward. Our heroes made a bold decision to pivot Flux Capacitor into a coffee bean counter, leveraging the same engineering prowess to develop a high-tech, precision-driven coffee roaster. Sounds crazy, right? But trust us, it was the right move.

By shifting their focus to a more accessible and consumer-facing product, the team discovered a passionate user base eager to indulge in high-quality, artisanal coffee. Word-of-mouth marketed their product beautifully, and the pivot helped them establish a strong online presence.

Fast forward a few years, and Flux Capacitor Coffee is thriving - all thanks to the gut-wrenching, yet ultimately rewarding, decision to pivot. So the next time you're faced with the daunting task of pivoting, remember that it's not a failure, but an opportunity to rewrite the script and find a path that aligns with your values and market demand.",1,1751979818.0,u_Helpful_ruben,0,1.0,False
1luo036,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1luo036/could_bialetti_venus_stovetop_coffee_maker/,Could Bialetti Venus Stovetop Coffee Maker Redefine Your Espresso Experience? Full Review Inside!,"The Bialetti 0007256/CN Venus Stovetop Coffee Maker has been sitting proudly on my kitchen counter for a few weeks now, and I can confidently say it has become more than just an appliance; it‚Äôs a part of my morning ritual. Crafted for espresso enthusiasts, this stainless steel moka pot is a fine blend of style and practicality. I appreciate how its sleek silver design seamlessly fits any kitchen aesthetic while delivering a satisfying coffee experience.

**Build and Aesthetic Appeal**

What caught my eye initially was the timeless, minimalist design of this coffee maker. The Bialetti Venus is constructed from high-quality 18/10 stainless steel, giving it both a polished appearance and robust build. Unlike many stovetop coffee makers that tend to look dated, this one feels modern yet durable. Its clean lines and ergonomic handle make it not just a functional tool but also a decorative piece in my kitchen space. A feature I particularly enjoy is its lightweight design, despite feeling sturdy; it‚Äôs easy to handle without the heft becoming a hassle.

**Ease of Use**

Mornings can be hectic, and this moka pot offers a straightforward, manual brewing process that practically ensures you can‚Äôt go wrong. Once I got the hang of filling it with water and ground coffee, the rest became second nature. The reusable filter eliminates the need to buy replacement pods or filters, which I found economically and environmentally rewarding. As a bonus, the process of hearing it gurgle as the coffee brews adds nostalgic charm to the brewing experience.

[Check Bialetti 0007256/CN Venus price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b07zl4wwwr/)

**Performance and Taste**

As someone who‚Äôs particular about coffee strength and flavor, I‚Äôve been impressed by the quality of brew it delivers. Whether I‚Äôm whipping up a quick Americano for myself or indulging in a mocha latte, the results consistently exceed expectations. The Venus is versatile enough to cater to various coffee preferences such as espresso, cappuccino, and iced coffee. Thanks to its induction compatibility, I tested it on both a modern induction stovetop and a traditional gas burner‚Äîthe quality remained consistent across devices. The 10-cup capacity ensures it meets the needs of both solo mornings and small get-togethers.

**Maintenance Requirements**

Cleaning the Venus is a breeze but requires a little diligence. The manufacturer recommends rinsing it with plain water rather than using harsh detergents or putting it in the dishwasher. I followed this advice diligently and found it helped preserve both the coffee maker and the taste of the brew. While the manual cleaning isn‚Äôt overly time-consuming, it does feel slightly old-school in today‚Äôs world of self-cleaning appliances.

**Highlights**

- Sleek and modern design with durable 18/10 stainless steel.
- Brews up to 10 espresso cups, suitable for individuals or family use.  
- Compatible with all stovetops, including induction options.  
- Reusable coffee filter, reducing waste and additional costs.  
- Easy to use, even for first-timers in the moka pot world.  

**Hurdles**

- Not dishwasher-safe, making manual cleaning necessary.  
- May require some trial and error to achieve the ideal coffee grind size.  
- Lightweight but may feel less substantial compared to traditional moka pots.  

**Peer Products**

To assess the broader market, I pitted this product against its leading rivals, like the Alessi Moka Pot and the Grosche Milano. While the Alessi offers a similarly stylish design, its price point may deter budget-conscious buyers. The Grosche Milano, on the other hand, comes in a variety of vibrant colors but lacks the induction compatibility of the Venus. One area where the Bialetti Venus excels is its sophisticated design combined with excellent heat distribution, ensuring even brewing without compromising aesthetics.

**Best Value**

Considering its durable stainless steel construction, compatibility with modern kitchens, and ability to brew coffee comparable to that of a caf√©, this coffee maker offers tremendous value for its price. While it isn‚Äôt the most affordable moka pot on the market, its performance and longevity more than justify the investment. For anyone who values a great cup of coffee and timeless design, this stovetop option provides a wonderful balance between form and function.

It‚Äôs funny because when I was a young mom and my kids were just toddlers- I flocked to coffee with creamer. And a few months in it became basically a little coffee and mostly dairy and sugar. Horrible. I did this for like 3-4 years, and then I switched to lattes. 

It was hard for me to stick to any type of plan of make a firm choice to change. I had horrible untreated combo ADHD. I would impulsively research healthier ways and then burn out from all the research that I did - and I‚Äôd never take any actions. This was a cycle that went for up until last year.

I was finally medicated for my adhd and it‚Äôs made a world of difference. It wasn‚Äôt like a change in one day though. I‚Äôve worked my habits up over the year since being medicated to be better. To be honest the final trigger to make the change was my most recent blood tests. I have all indicators of PCOS, and my A1C came back prediabetic.

II‚Äôve incorporated eating healthier such as less meat and when I do it‚Äôs lean. My plates are filled with more vegetables and good, nutrient filled Whole Foods.

Matcha was bitter even with strawberry flavouring

Had too many clumps and was grainy

When mixed it left a pale green colour and was a little fishy tasting

They used regular dairy milk which gave a disgusting aftertaste

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **UEFA Champions League Qualification: FK RFS vs FCI Levadia ‚Äì A Tale of Two Small Nations**  
*July 8, 2025 ‚Äì 19:30 Kiev Time*

**The Setup:**  
Two teams, both proud of their domestic dominance but with r√©sum√©s that scream ‚Äúwe exist, and we‚Äôre not afraid to qualify.‚Äù FK RFS (Latvia) and FCI Levadia (Estonia) are the kind of clubs that make you wonder if the Champions League Qualifiers are just a giant, bureaucratic game of ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs the Least Known?‚Äù RFS, with three straight Latvian titles since 2021, is the ‚Äúnew money‚Äù in this match, while Levadia, with 11 Estonian crowns (including a 2024 comeback after a three-year hiatus), is the grizzled veteran of the Estonian wilderness.

**The Odds (and the Math):**

* **FK RFS (-450):** Implied probability of **60.6%** (1 / 1.65).
* **FCI Levadia (+400):** Implied probability of **22.2%** (1 / 4.5).
* **Draw (4.2):** Implied probability of **23.8%**.

But here‚Äôs the kicker: In soccer, underdogs win **41%** of the time. Levadia‚Äôs implied 22.2% is a *full 18.8%* below that historical benchmark. That‚Äôs like betting on a team to win the lottery and then complaining when they don‚Äôt.

**The EV Breakdown:**

* **Levadia‚Äôs Expected Value (EV):**  
(41% chance to win \* 4.5) - (59% chance to lose \* 1) = **1.845 - 0.59 = +1.255**.  
*Translation: This is a value bomb.*
* **RFS‚Äôs EV:**  
(60.6% \* 1) - (39.4% \* 4.5) = **0.606 - 1.773 = -1.167**.  
*Translation: Don‚Äôt do it. Unless you enjoy throwing money into the void.*

**Key Factors:**

1. **Historical Context:** The teams have met in friendlies, splitting a 1-1-1 record. Levadia‚Äôs last win? A 2021 friendly in which they outlasted RFS like a Netflix docuseries about Estonian perseverance.
2. **Style of Play:** Both teams are built for defense-first football. RFS has conceded just 1.2 goals per game in qualifiers this season. Levadia? They‚Äôre the kings of the ‚Äú1-0, we‚Äôre legends‚Äù school of thought.
3. **Injuries/Updates:** None reported. Both squads are healthy, which is either a blessing or a sign that these teams can‚Äôt afford to lose anyone to a coffee spill.

**The Verdict:**  
**Best Bet: FCI Levadia (+400) to upset FK RFS**

* **Why?** The EV is screaming it louder than a drunk fan in a stadium. Levadia‚Äôs 41% underdog win rate vs. their 22.2% implied probability is a golden ticket. Plus, who doesn‚Äôt love an underdog story? Especially one involving Estonian football, which is basically the ‚ÄúDavid vs. Goliath‚Äù of the Baltic States.

**Honorable Mention:**  
**Under 3.0 Goals (1.78)**

* The match is expected to be low-scoring (bookmakers imply a 55.5% chance of under 3.0 goals). With both teams prioritizing defense, this is a solid ‚Äúsafe play‚Äù for those who want to avoid the chaos of high-scoring upsets.

**Final Thought:**  
This isn‚Äôt just a match‚Äîit‚Äôs a geopolitical statement. Latvia vs. Estonia, in the Champions League, for all the world to see. And if Levadia pulls off the upset? Estonia‚Äôs national football Twitter will be *unhinged*.

*Go with the underdog. It‚Äôs statistically sound. And also, honestly, way more fun.* üèÜ

Despite its ominous name, the caf√© had a strangely cozy vibe, wooden counters, half-lit lanterns, and a chalkboard menu written in surprisingly elegant cursive. Behind the counter stood Kat, wiping a cup clean while something... giggled behind him.

Alex tilted his head. ‚ÄúKat?‚Äù

Kat didn‚Äôt look up. ‚ÄúAlex. Good timing.‚Äù

Then the sound of crashing cups, giggles, and an odd swirl of glowing cards broke the quiet hum of the caf√©. From behind the counter, a small toddler with silvery eyes tumbled into view, laughing as a glowing roulette wheel spun behind him, vanishing just before it hit the wall.

Theon gave a low huff. Alex raised an eyebrow.

‚ÄúKat,‚Äù Alex said slowly, ‚ÄúIs that a baby?‚Äù

Kat sighed and finally looked up.¬†

‚ÄúTechnically, a saint toddler. And yes. He appeared this morning out of nowhere well, not nowhere. Something summoned his parents by accident.‚Äù

The toddler waved a cookie in the air, which instantly split into two, and both cookies began floating before raining crumbs all over the counter.

Kat added flatly

‚ÄúThe parents are angels. They left him here while they went on what they called one last date before vanishing into the void.‚Äù

Alex blinked.¬†

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs oddly romantic and deeply irresponsible.‚Äù

Kat nodded.

¬†‚ÄúYeah. They said he doesn‚Äôt fight, just plays. But that ‚Äòplay‚Äô has already reversed my gravity twice and caused a goldfish to win at poker. Look... I can‚Äôt keep watching him. You‚Äôve dealt with weird things before. Can I count on you?‚Äù

Alex glanced at Theon. The wolf looked like he was already regretting this.

He sighed. ‚ÄúAlright. I‚Äôll keep him out of trouble until his parents come back.‚Äù

Kat looked immensely relieved. ‚ÄúJust... whatever you do, don‚Äôt let him near dice or card, or anything to that matter‚Äù

Alex had been watching children for exactly seven minutes when he realized this was a mistake.

They were standing in front of the Bread Boy Bakery, a warm-smelling place known for two things: the softest cinnamon rolls in the city... and being a front for the underground Bread Mafia, run by a man known only as The Don.

Inside, the toddler had already made friends with a loaf of sourdough that had mysteriously grown limbs and started singing opera.

‚ÄúStop feeding the bread,‚Äù Alex muttered.

Theon barked softly, nudging the toddler away from the rising dough choir. A glowing halo of cards spun above the child‚Äôs head. One flipped and flared with green light, suddenly, everyone in the bakery started dancing uncontrollably.

The Don, a burly man in a flour-stained apron, leaned over the counter.

‚ÄúControl your child,‚Äù he said, smiling through gritted teeth.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying,‚Äù Alex replied, barely dodging a baguette doing the waltz.

After a bribe of three buttered croissants and Theon chasing down a rogue dancing crouton, the group was politely escorted out.

Next stop: The Emperor Bar, a smoky, dim-lit den of whispers and trades.

‚ÄúKid,‚Äù Alex said

‚ÄúThis place is sacred. People come here for secrets. No chaos. No... roulette wheels.‚Äù

The child blinked at him innocently.

Alex turned to the bartender. Recemperor nodded once.¬†

‚ÄúNo problems today, I hope?‚Äù

Alex was about to reply when a card spun into existenc**e** and landed on a table. It glowed softly.

‚Äú‚ÄòAll secrets revealed.‚Äô‚Äù the card read.

Suddenly, the entire bar fell into chaos. Every whispered secret echoed loudly from unseen mouths: betrayal, love affairs, real names, hidden stash spots everything.

One man screamed,¬†

‚ÄúI KNEW IT! YOU‚ÄôVE BEEN EATING MY SPICES!‚Äù

Another shouted,¬†

‚ÄúMy mother‚Äôs name isn‚Äôt even Gloria!?‚Äù

Alex scooped up the child in a panic.

¬†‚ÄúWe‚Äôre leaving.‚Äù

Recemperor‚Äôs eyes twitched.¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll owe me. Put it on the Fool‚Äôs tab.‚Äù

In desperation, Alex took the child to the Poster Park, hoping a simple slide would calm him. It worked. For five whole minutes.

Then the child summoned a dozen copies of Theon, all puppies, all howling, all chasing pigeons into chaos. It was like a storm of fluff and fate.

The original Theon barked angrily at his younger clones.

Finally, as the sky turned gold, a shimmer in the air opened, and two glowing figures stepped through, their silhouettes bathed in divine light. The parents had returned.

The toddler floated toward them, giggling, arms stretched. The mother angel smiled.¬†

‚ÄúYou did well, little ones.‚Äù

Alex crossed his arms.¬†

‚ÄúDefine Well.‚Äù

¬†The father bowed slightly.¬†

‚ÄúNo casualties. That‚Äôs enough.‚Äù

They vanished as quickly as they came, taking the roulette wheel, the luck, the chaos... and the toddler.

Alex stood silently, dusting off breadcrumbs from his coat. Theon whined, clearly exhausted.

‚Äú‚Ä¶I‚Äôm never having kids‚Äù¬†

Alex muttered. Theon barked in agreement.¬†

They were back in the Cafe of the End.

Kat stood behind the counter, stirring coffee as if nothing had happened. No child. No parents. No chaos.

‚ÄúWhat the-‚Äù Alex spun in place. Theon barked, equally confused.

Kat looked up calmly.¬†

‚ÄúWhat's wrong? You seem confused.‚Äù

‚Äúhuh?‚Äù Alex said.

‚ÄúWhat happened to the toddler?‚Äù

Kat tilted his head. ‚ÄúToddler? What toddler?‚Äù

‚ÄúBut- but we were in the city all day, at the bakery, the Emperor‚Äôs bar, there were clones of Theon!‚Äù Alex's voice rose.

Kat placed a sealed deck of cards on the counter. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been sitting at that table with the wolf for the past ten minutes, eyes glazed over like someone who drew the wrong card.‚Äù

Alex stepped back. His heartbeat quickened. He turned to Theon, who looked as alarmed as a wolf could.

Alex froze. As his mind began to run with thought¬†

‚ÄúThat wasn‚Äôt a toddler.‚Äù

Alex stared down at his hands. They were shaking.

‚ÄúSo none of it was real?‚Äù he whispered.

Kat gave a half-smile.¬†

‚ÄúReality‚Äôs a strong word when you‚Äôre dealing with a Mythical Creature‚Äôs consciousness.‚Äù

Alex sank into the chair behind him. Theon nudged his leg, looking dazed.

Kat poured a cup of coffee and placed it gently in front of him.

‚ÄúDrink. You're lucky. Most who get caught in the Fool's dreams don‚Äôt come back knowing they were dreaming.‚Äù

Alex stared at the steam rising from the cup.

‚Äú‚Ä¶And the worst part is,‚Äù he muttered,¬†

‚ÄúI still feel like I owe someone at the Bread Mafia money.‚Äù

Kat chuckled.¬†

‚ÄúMaybe you do. Or maybe that‚Äôs just what the Fool wanted.‚Äù

Built 12 apps in the last few months, tried various marketing strategies on Twitter, still haven't made my first dollar. Looking for honest feedback on what I'm doing wrong.

**My Current Strategy**

1. Sharing my progress (BuildInPublic) on [Twitter/X](https://x.com/koponbun) (1,300+ tweets), engaging with dev community, posting about my apps/tools.
2. Distribution: Twitter, Reddit, some communities. Tried but didn't gain traction
3. Tested Ko-fi, BuyMeaCoffee, Patreon and tried integrating various payment systems such as Stripe, Paddle, Polar

**The Problem**

I can build and ship quickly, but I'm clearly missing something on the business side. Traffic exists but no conversions to paying users.

**What I Think I'm Missing**

1. My tools work but maybe don't solve painful enough problems
2.  Haven't figured out what people will actually pay for
3.  Twitter might not be where my target users are
4.  Building what I think people need vs. what they actually need

**Questions**

* For simple web tools, what pricing models actually work? Freemium? One-time purchase? Ads?
* How do you validate if there's real demand before building?
* Where do you find users for such tools besides Twitter and Reddit?
* Should I pick one tool and make it great, or keep the portfolio approach?

**What I've Built**

Been focusing on simple web tools that solve small & specific problems:

* [Password Generator](https://www.fastpassgen.com/) \- Clean, fast password creation
* [QR Code Generator](https://qrcodeproj.vercel.app/) \- Simple QR codes for links/text
* [Base64 Encoder/Decoder](https://base64coder.vercel.app/) \- For developers
* [Text Case Converter](https://textcaseproj.vercel.app/) \- UPPER, lower, Title Case
* [Unix Timestamp Converter](https://unixconverter.vercel.app/) \- Time conversion tool
* [Word Counter](https://wordcounterproj.vercel.app/) \- For writers/students
* [Focus Timer](https://zenfocustimer.vercel.app/) \- Pomodoro-style productivity app

Other unfinished apps:

* [FishTea](https://fishtea.vercel.app/) \- AI Text Humanizer
* [ZenLabs](https://zenlabs.vercel.app/) \- Productivity & Focus Trainer

And 3+ Mobile apps (unreleased)

Most get decent traffic but no monetization yet.

I know I'm doing something fundamentally wrong because the effort is there but results aren't. Any honest feedback would be helpful.

1. Using ‚Äúpara‚Äù when you mean duration

‚ùå Estudi√© para dos horas. 

‚úÖ Estudi√© por dos horas. ‚Üí I studied for two hours. 

Use por to show how long something lasts. Para is for deadlines: para ma√±ana = by tomorrow.

2. Mixing up goals and causes

‚ùå Voy a correr por perder peso. 

‚úÖ Voy a correr para perder peso. ‚Üí I‚Äôm going to run in order to lose weight. 

Para + infinitive = your goal (‚Äúin order to‚Ä¶‚Äù). Por = the cause or reason.

3 . Using ‚Äúpor‚Äù instead of ‚Äúpara‚Äù when talking about the intended use or purpose of something

‚ùå Este vaso es por agua. 

‚úÖ Este vaso es para agua. ‚Üí This glass is for water. 

Use para to indicate the intended use or purpose of an object.

4 . Wrong preposition in exchanges

‚ùå Te cambio mi caf√© para tu t√©. 

‚úÖ Te cambio mi caf√© por tu t√©. ‚Üí I‚Äôll trade you my coffee for your tea. 

When exchanging things, always use por ‚Äî think ‚Äúin exchange for.‚Äù

5 . Using ""para"" instead of ""por"" to express the cause of a punishment

‚ùå Lo multaron para exceso de velocidad. 

‚úÖ Lo multaron por exceso de velocidad. ‚Üí He was fined for speeding. 

Por expresses the reason or cause of an action, especially in punishments or consequences.

6 . Misusing ‚Äúpara‚Äù for transport or movement

‚ùå Viajamos para tren. 

‚úÖ Viajamos por tren / en tren. ‚Üí We traveled by train. 

Use por to talk about transport or moving through a place. Caminamos por el parque = We walked through the park.

If you‚Äôd like to practice using por and para through various exercises that will help you solidify the difference between these two prepositions, follow the [link](https://spanishailines.com/modules/lessons/default/3432e29b-cef9-4bf5-a913-5d764250b425) to our website.

My kitchen is perpetually cluttered, and the Spacemaker design instantly appealed to me. Anything that can free up counter space while still performing multiple functions is a win in my book. This one doubles as a mini food processor and coffee grinder, which sounds like a dream for someone who enjoys cooking but despises having to store multiple appliances.

**Compact and Clever Design**

The under-cabinet mounting option is possibly the standout feature here. I love the way it saves me from sacrificing precious counter space, and once installed, it gives off a clean and polished look in the kitchen. However, the actual setup was not as straightforward as I‚Äôd hoped. The provided mounting template wasn‚Äôt the most intuitive, and it took some trial and error to get everything aligned. While it‚Äôs not a deal-breaker, consider grabbing an extra pair of hands if you‚Äôre planning to install this. But when it‚Äôs up there, it‚Äôs totally worth it.

**Functionality and Dual Use**

What genuinely surprised me is just how well it performs both as a coffee grinder and a mini food processor. I‚Äôve used it to grind my morning coffee beans to a consistent texture in under a minute, and it even processes dry spices like a charm. Then I switched it up and tested the chopping blade on onions, nuts, and small batches of vegetables. The blades are stainless steel, sharp, and get the job done quickly. However, I wouldn‚Äôt exactly call it powerful. It‚Äôs effective for small to medium workloads, but once I tried tossing in a slightly larger batch of carrots, it did struggle a little.

[Find the best price for Black+Decker CG800B on Amazon.](https://ultrasonicstore.com/p/b001tann7m/)

***Upsides***

- Compact Spacemaker design saves counter space.  
- Dual-purpose functionality: coffee grinder and food processor in one.  
- Steel blades handle consistent grinding and chopping efficiently.  
- Comes with two transparent plastic containers for separate uses.  

**Durability and Build**

The black plastic construction looks sleek and modern, but it doesn‚Äôt scream ‚Äúpremium.‚Äù It‚Äôs lightweight, which makes it easy to handle, but for an appliance installed under a cabinet, you might wish it had a bit more bulk for a sturdier feel. The materials feel durable enough for regular use as long as you aren‚Äôt taxing it beyond its capacity. The chopping and grinding containers are simple to clean, though they require hand washing, which is a bit of a hassle if you‚Äôre used to tossing everything in a dishwasher. 

**Less Favorable Aspects**

- Mounting can be tricky and may require adjustments.  
- Limited capacity for larger food prepping tasks.  
- Requires hand washing rather than being dishwasher safe.  

**Competing Products**

Comparing this to other compact food processors like the Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus, the Black+Decker CG800B fares well in terms of its unique under-cabinet mounting capability. The Mini-Prep, however, makes up for its counter-space usage with superior power and a broader capacity, making it more suitable for larger chopping tasks. Another rival could be Hamilton Beach‚Äôs small choppers, which offer similar multitasking but lack the coffee-grinding functionality that this one delivers. Where it excels is in its multifunctionality and space-saving design, but it may fall short for those tackling bigger kitchen projects.

**Price Worthiness**

While I won‚Äôt quote specific pricing, it‚Äôs a decent value if you‚Äôre looking for something versatile yet compact. The dual-purpose aspect means you‚Äôre getting two appliances in one, which softens the financial blow a bit. That said, if you‚Äôre someone who grinds coffee daily or needs a processor that can handle heavy-duty tasks, you may need to evaluate whether the investment aligns with your expectations.

# Best Slush Cups and Lids 2025: Top Brands Reviewed

The perfect slush cup and lid combination is more than just a container; it's an essential part of the frozen beverage experience. From keeping your slush cold and preventing messy spills to offering convenience and reusability, the right cup and lid can significantly enhance enjoyment. With a plethora of options available, ranging from disposable to reusable and featuring various designs and materials, selecting the best can be a daunting task. This review aims to simplify the process by highlighting the top brands and models expected to dominate the market in 2025, focusing on key features, benefits, and user suitability.

[[Browse top-rated slush cups and lids on Amazon]](https://best.healthytargeting.com/clearance-products/?KW=slush+cups+and+lids)
## Key Features Analysis

The quality of slush cups and lids depends on several crucial features. These include material durability, lid seal effectiveness, insulation capabilities, and overall design for ease of use and cleaning. Understanding these aspects will help you make an informed decision that aligns with your specific requirements, whether for personal use, parties, or commercial purposes.

**Material Durability:** The material used in slush cups and lids directly impacts their longevity and reusability.

High-quality, food-grade plastics, such as BPA-free polypropylene (PP) or Tritan, are preferred for reusable options due to their resistance to cracking and shattering. Disposable options often utilize PET or paper, which are lightweight and recyclable but less durable for multiple uses. The thickness and construction of the material also contribute to its overall strength and resistance to deformation under pressure or temperature changes. A durable material ensures the cup and lid can withstand repeated use and washing, reducing the need for frequent replacements.

**Lid Seal Effectiveness:** A secure and leak-proof lid seal is paramount for preventing spills and maintaining the integrity of the slush.

Lids with tight-fitting designs, often incorporating silicone gaskets or threaded closures, offer superior spill protection compared to snap-on lids with a looser fit. The effectiveness of the seal is also influenced by the material compatibility between the cup and lid, ensuring a snug and reliable closure. A well-designed lid minimizes the risk of leaks during transport or handling, making it ideal for on-the-go use and preventing messy accidents. Some lids also feature resealable openings or straw slots that maintain the seal's integrity even when in use.

**Insulation Capabilities:** Proper insulation is crucial for maintaining the desired temperature and consistency of the slush over an extended period.

Double-walled construction, whether in plastic or stainless steel, provides an insulating barrier that slows down heat transfer, keeping the slush colder for longer. Some cups also incorporate vacuum insulation for even greater thermal performance, maintaining ice crystals for hours. Insulation not only preserves the slush's texture but also prevents condensation from forming on the exterior of the cup, keeping hands dry and comfortable. The effectiveness of insulation depends on the material's thermal conductivity and the design of the cup's walls.

**Design and Ergonomics:** The overall design of the cup and lid should prioritize user comfort and ease of handling.

Features like a comfortable grip, a wide base for stability, and a smooth rim for easy drinking contribute to a positive user experience. Lids with ergonomic designs, such as raised edges or textured surfaces, provide a secure grip and prevent slippage. The size and shape of the cup should also be considered, ensuring it fits comfortably in hand and is compatible with standard cup holders. A well-designed cup and lid enhance usability and make the slush-drinking experience more enjoyable.

**Ease of Cleaning:** The ease of cleaning is a crucial factor, particularly for reusable slush cups and lids.

Smooth surfaces and simple designs minimize the accumulation of residue and make cleaning more efficient. Dishwasher-safe materials are highly desirable, allowing for convenient and thorough cleaning. Lids with removable gaskets or components facilitate access to hard-to-reach areas and prevent the buildup of bacteria. Proper cleaning is essential for maintaining hygiene and prolonging the lifespan of the cup and lid.

**Ventilation and Airflow:** Ventilation features on lids can significantly improve the drinking experience.

Vents help regulate airflow, preventing a vacuum from forming inside the cup as the slush is consumed, which can cause suction and make it difficult to drink. These vents also help to maintain a consistent flow of slush, preventing it from becoming overly thick or difficult to manage. Strategically placed vents can also reduce the risk of spills by equalizing pressure inside the cup.

## Core Benefits

The best slush cups and lids provide several tangible benefits that enhance the overall user experience. These include improved convenience, enhanced enjoyment of the beverage, and cost-effectiveness over time, particularly with reusable options.

**Enhanced Beverage Enjoyment:** High-quality slush cups and lids preserve the slush's consistency and temperature, contributing to a more satisfying drinking experience.

By maintaining the ideal coldness and preventing excessive melting, these cups ensure that the slush retains its desired texture and flavor for a longer period. This translates to a more refreshing and enjoyable beverage, especially on hot days. Furthermore, a well-designed cup and lid can enhance the visual appeal of the slush, making it more enticing to consume.

**Improved Convenience and Portability:** Slush cups with secure lids allow for easy transport and consumption on the go.

Leak-proof lids prevent spills and messes, making it convenient to carry the slush in a car, bag, or while walking. The ergonomic design of the cup ensures a comfortable grip and prevents slippage, further enhancing portability. This makes slush cups ideal for picnics, outdoor events, and travel.

**Cost-Effectiveness:** Investing in reusable slush cups and lids can lead to significant cost savings over time.

While disposable cups may seem cheaper initially, the cost of repeatedly purchasing them can quickly add up. Reusable cups, although more expensive upfront, offer a long-term solution that eliminates the need for constant replacements. Furthermore, reusable cups are often more durable and can withstand repeated use and washing, making them a more sustainable and economical choice in the long run.

**Reduced Environmental Impact:** Choosing reusable slush cups and lids contributes to a more sustainable lifestyle by reducing waste.

Disposable cups contribute significantly to landfill waste and pollution. By opting for reusable options, consumers can minimize their environmental footprint and promote a more eco-friendly approach to enjoying slush. Reusable cups also reduce the demand for single-use plastics, which can have a detrimental impact on ecosystems.

**Enhanced Hygiene:** Reusable cups that are easy to clean promote better hygiene and prevent the buildup of bacteria.

Disposable cups are often used without proper washing, which can lead to the accumulation of germs and bacteria. Reusable cups, on the other hand, can be thoroughly cleaned after each use, ensuring a more hygienic drinking experience. The smooth surfaces and simple designs of high-quality reusable cups make cleaning easy and efficient, minimizing the risk of contamination.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common consumer questions about slush cups and lids can help clarify any doubts and facilitate informed purchasing decisions. These questions often revolve around compatibility, cleaning, and specific usage scenarios.

**Are these slush cups and lids dishwasher safe?**

Most high-quality reusable slush cups and lids are designed to be dishwasher safe, typically on the top rack. However, it's always recommended to check the manufacturer's instructions to ensure compatibility and prevent damage. Disposable cups are generally not dishwasher safe and should be discarded after use.

**Can I use these cups for other beverages besides slush?**

Yes, these cups can be used for a variety of cold beverages, including iced coffee, smoothies, and juices. The insulation capabilities of some cups also make them suitable for keeping other drinks cold for extended periods. However, it's important to note that some cups may not be suitable for hot beverages due to the risk of deformation or damage.

**How do I prevent leaks with these lids?**

To prevent leaks, ensure that the lid is properly aligned and securely fastened to the cup. For lids with silicone gaskets, make sure the gasket is clean and properly seated in the lid. Avoid overfilling the cup, as this can put pressure on the lid and cause leaks. If using a straw, ensure that the straw is compatible with the lid and does not compromise the seal.

**What is the best way to clean reusable slush cups and lids?**

For best results, wash reusable slush cups and lids with warm, soapy water immediately after use. Use a soft sponge or cloth to avoid scratching the surface. For hard-to-reach areas, use a bottle brush or small cleaning tool. Rinse thoroughly with clean water and allow to air dry. For dishwasher-safe cups and lids, place them on the top rack of the dishwasher.

- we will both arrive at train station (Montparnasse)

- we don't plan on doing tourism or anything crazy. Just hang around and talk a lot. 

I'm looking for : 

- a hotel, hopefully not too far away from the train station. Nothing too fancy or expensive. A nice neighborhood would be cool but optional. I'm mostly looking for clean and safe. We are willing to move a little bit (like 45min walk or subway). If you don't have a particular hotel brand/name, just go with a street or neighbourhood.

- somewhere to eat (vegetarian), walk, have a coffee, sit down and chat. I'm thinking not crazily busy (I know it's still Paris), casual, maybe street musicians.

I'm sorry for the quite vague explanation. We'd just like to enjoy our time together, for things to be as simple as possible, nice ambience.

And honestly, at first, I was like, ‚ÄúWait, another dosa and idli place? Really?‚Äù But after thinking about it for a second, I feel like there‚Äôs more to this than meets the eye.

I mean, sure, Cafe Amudham has all the classic ghee-laden dosas and idlis that make Rameshwaram a fan favorite in Bengaluru. But what sets Cafe Amudham apart is that it‚Äôs going down the quick-service restaurant (QSR) route. They‚Äôre not about just one or two spots; it‚Äôs all about rapid expansion, opening outlets in multiple cities, almost like how McDonald‚Äôs does it.

Now, Rameshwaram, on the other hand, is more about building a strong local presence in Bengaluru. They‚Äôre not in a rush to go global. It‚Äôs a much slower, deeper play for them.

So, maybe that‚Äôs why Nikhil Kamath is betting on Cafe Amudham. I feel like he‚Äôs seeing something in the QSR model that others might not. Given his previous investments in brands like Third Wave Coffee, maybe he‚Äôs thinking Cafe Amudham could be the next big thing in the food space, especially if they scale quickly.

I think it‚Äôs a strategic move, and maybe it‚Äôll pay off. But what do you guys think? So maybe this might turn out to be a risky gamble or a smart bet?

Now I'm in grad school and officially got diagnosed when I realized that it was becoming a roadbloack for the demanding workload I have. Being diagnosed gave me clarity but also made me anxious in a way? Let me explain why.

I was always fearful that if I got tested for ADHD that they would tell me nothing was wrong with me, which would then make me feel even more confused. Luckily that wasn't the case- Dr said it was definite and now I have more clarity than ever about myself. But I guess I never planned this scenario out either. Medication options were discussed, accommodation letters were mentioned and not to mention just the social aspect of it all too? I'm scared to get on meds and have my friends or classmates judge me. I'm scared to finally admit to people that I was right about ADHD because I don't want them thinking that I'm lying or faking it (which I don't know how but you know people..) just cause I'm in grad school. I know myself, my story my experience and that's all that matters, but I guess the navigating part of this feels hard. I've been recommended to approach this that natural way with L-Thyanine and coffee and avoiding red-40, guessing everyone has a stigma about the medication part of this .but idk. 

So what was your experience? Did you tell people you had ADHD? Did you use meds or the natural remedies? Did anyone judge you? And how do you perceive yourself with that diagnosis now? ",2,1751977866.0,ADHD,6,0.76,False

I‚Äôm writing this post to share my recent experience, hoping my story might provide the crucial piece of information that someone else has been searching for.

For about a year, my Type 2 rosacea was calm and well-managed. However, after I was diagnosed with ADHD last July and started taking **Wellbutrin (Bupropion)**, my rosacea slowly began to relapse. The flare-ups were minor at first, which is why I didn't initially connect them to the new medication, but they gradually became more persistent and severe over the following months. By November, my skin was in the worst state it had ever been.

Over the next six months, my dermatologist and I tried to find the cause. We went through the usual potential triggers, like sun exposure and stress, and tried various treatments. Unfortunately, any improvement was always temporary, and the severe flare-ups, including constant pustules and papules, always returned.

I began to suspect the Bupropion could be the cause, but finding a clear path forward was difficult. My psychiatrist was skeptical, stating there was a very slim chance the medication was the culprit, though she was open to me trying to taper off. My dermatologist, on the other hand, didn't have specific knowledge about this medication's link to rosacea and couldn't find any information after a search. However, since our other treatments weren't providing lasting results, she agreed it was worth trying to stop taking these meds to test this hypothesis.

This conflicting advice left me in a very difficult position. Wellbutrin was working wonders for my mental health, and given my psychiatrist's reassurance alongside my dermatologist's uncertainty, I hesitated to stop the medication at first. It was only about two months later, when the flare-ups became even worse and I started getting small papules on my forehead, that I felt I had no other choice but to try.

It has now been two months since my last dose, and the results have been remarkable. My skin has calmed down significantly, with no new active pustules or papules. I have not changed the skincare routine my dermatologist prescribed for me four months ago; the only variable that changed was stopping the Bupropion. I can now even tolerate my usual triggers, like coffee and occasional alcohol, without a reaction. It's also worth noting that I take Vyvanse, another ADHD medication, which I initially worried about, but it does not seem to trigger my rosacea at all.

I wanted to share this because I know how frustrating it is when you're trying everything and nothing works. The lack of information about this potential side effect made the process much more difficult. If you are in a similar situation, I hope my experience can serve as a valuable data point to discuss with your doctors. Advocating for yourself can be challenging, but in my case, it was the only way to find a solution.",3,1751977859.0,Rosacea,2,1.0,False

1lun23t,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1lun23t/when_did_you_realize_this_was_an_american_religion/,When did you realize this was an American religion?,"For me, it wasn't exactly a lightbulb moment, but rather a gradual progression. I grew up as a JW and in a country that was mostly Christian (even if many people didn't actually really go to church that much). Going out knocking on doors mostly had me come across people saying they were catholic or some form of protestant (JWism aside). However, it wasn't until I spent a good 10 years or so in two foreign language fields that catered to non-Christian populations that made me start to see this is an American religion.

First, our whole service approach falls apart when the person we meet at the door isn't a Christian (or coming from that kind of a background). I remember using the suggested presentations to read such and such a scripture and being met with a polite response and zero interest. At one point, people who were in the field in my circuits just thought it was because they had never heard of Jesus before, but when asked many said ""yeah, heard of him, seems like a neat story but I'm (buddhist/daoist/muslim). 

We'd do lots of research into the WT literature to figure how to approach the ministry better but it was never really that effective. The magazines just taught us to throw random scriptures at people and hope they made an impression. Sometimes it did, but it often never really progressed past ""neat"" for people in these fields. 

In the first field, we actually did have a lot of studies but basically all of them were ""interested"" in the religion beacuse it seemed exotic and because from their perspective, they were chilling with new friends. Like, you might invite someone out for coffee a few times before ever bringing up the Bible. Eventually when they were reeled in though, it often fell apart because again, the problems or questions they would pose were different than what the GB was prepared for. Or maybe an article touched on an issue they were having but again, because there wasn't a Christian background, the answers didn't really make sense to them. 

The second field was similar as well. We'd try reading say, Revelation 21:4 or Jeremiah 29:11, to them and they'd say ""yeah, I don't believe in Revelations"" and then it'd be like, crap what do I do? The WT just says to read this scripture and it will be a good result.  Then there would be the questions like ""why do important people for your religion all come from America if this isn't an American religion?"".

At first I ignored it, but then I heard a talk. The speaker was a local and he said ""In the East we tend to believe that people from stories are worthy of worship, but as God's people we know that is not something that Jehovah believes in. We know that only the Bible can be trusted"" and then all my service experiences started to click for me. Yes, the GB trains us to view other religions as a storybook, but most of our logic can be flipped back on us too. A Buddhist could easily call the Bible a storybook as well. Conversions are often low among people of other faiths for this reason I think. After all, 99% of our literature is aimed at correcting issues that the GB believes exists in other Christian sects, but they honestly have no idea what to do with people from non-Christian backgrounds. 

I think this is also why they shifted to the whole ""we don't need to talk about the Bible, befriend them, love bomb then, and then convert them"" approach. ",11,1751977085.0,exjw,8,0.93,False

Living with TBI means facing challenges that often don‚Äôt have easy fixes. The big stuff‚Äîmemory, fatigue, identity‚Äîcan feel overwhelming and out of reach.

But sometimes, it‚Äôs the small daily annoyances‚Äîthe little things that pile up‚Äîthat sap our energy. What if those had their own fixes? Maybe silly, maybe imaginary, but maybe they help us breathe a little easier.

Welcome to the **Department of Easy Fixes**, a playful look at the everyday problems that plague us, and the quirky solutions that might just make life less complicated.

Here are a few favorites:

* **One Standard Deviation‚Ñ¢**: Smart devices that don‚Äôt make you feel stupid.

* **The Perpetual Surveyor‚Ñ¢**: A machine that asks for your input again and again‚Äîwhile politely ignoring your answers.

And for the days when nothing feels right:

* **The Existential Alarm Clock‚Ñ¢**: Only wakes you for things that actually matter. Settings: ‚ÄúToday,‚Äù ‚ÄúSomeday,‚Äù and ‚ÄúNever.‚Äù

Some days, no gadget can fix the big stuff. On those days, we honor the try ‚Äî and each other.

1lumzms,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1lumzms/my_partner_wants_to_constantly_have_long_talks/,My partner wants to constantly have long talks about emotions and it is becoming exhausting,"I (32M) have been with my partner (25M) for about a year. Early on he let me know that he has suffered a lot of trauma, both physical and emotional from everyone around him - his parents, bullies, past friends, exes etc. Almost all our physical dates included long periods of him telling me about his bad experiences. I always felt horrible and tried to reassure him that I would never do those things and that my worst quality according to most is my stubbornness. I never get physical in arguments, I try to not be manipulative (some times I catch myself slipping), I am (almost brutally) honest and generally think that if you don't like someone, you should cut ties with them (which I have done with multiple people, friends and family).

After a while we had to go LDR because of my job in another country. When we facetimed, he'd often be in a bad mood. It was usually some argument with his parents, which ruined his mood for the rest of the day. As he was already distressed, he'd be more snappy with me, which resulted in a lot of arguments along the LDR months. After an argument, I noticed that he would always need long, exhausting conversations, which would go in circles in order to feel like the argument had been solved. Even if I told him I understood his perspective and I would try to improve my attitude, he'd still sulk and say he didn't feel satisfied and that he wanted the conversation to last longer.

Lately, it's become a bigger issue. We're currently non-LDR, as I've returned to my folks for the summer, and he will always try to be upset about something. The list of the triggers (in no particular order, non-exhaustive) of the past few months have been:

* Me not doing something minor he wanted in a video game we play together
* My mum's meal prep food tastes too ""frozeny"" and he'd rather starve
* Me telling him to prepare something else if he didn't like the existing food
* Me asking him to make me a coffee when he was making his
* My mum coming in the house (we live in the same building, but not apartment) to pick up something of hers
* The phone ringing
* My ex asking me something about work (we worked together in an ongoing project)
* My dreams
* His dreams
* Me telling him to stop wasting water/electricity (bills double when he's around, even though we're 3 and with him 4)
* The sea being kinda murky
* Soup too watery

One main issue is that whenever we talk, if I try to talk about my side, he will always try to inject something irrelevant about how my actions hurt him so that we never discuss my point. It has to be about him, it has to be him that has been mistreated, misjudged and attacked, and my experience is trivial in front of his insurmountable issues, such as his socks having a hole. It doesn't help that he's always misinterpreting my words because he's struggling with using and understanding language (he's told me it's because of his high school trauma). He's using wrong words and understanding my words incorrectly, but we've worked on that somewhat and I correct him so that our conversations make sense.

As you can guess, I have come to a breaking point regarding conversations about his feelings. They feel like punishment, since they must never be quick, the solution must not be provided early on and it needs to drag till Daylight savings time ends. As I mentioned earlier, even if I do everything right and I say all the right things, he will not be satisfied if it ends too quickly. Me trying to avoid the endless conversations has had some kind of conditioning effect on him, and even if we do talk he'll keep it in the back of his mind and he'll try to start a new conversation with the same issue when we are not in an argument, so that he feels satisfied with the length we've talked about the issue.

I've attempted to offer compromises, such as he can talk non-stop if he so wishes, but if I don't have something to offer I will just let him speak, or if I have an issue with something he does, I get to talk about it, but he can't bring up an irrelevant issue, so that our talk does not focus on him. He's been able to do this once or twice, but I can see from his attitude afterwards that he doesn't like not getting to do the talking. I know these are not ideal, but I am not a talker. For me an argument is solved when the initial problem is solved and the angry emotions subside. For him an argument is solved with at least 2-3 hours of talking, even if we are still angry and the issue persists.

Advice?

TL;DR: My boyfriend is always upset by something and wants to talk about it extensively. He struggles with expression and often misunderstands or miscommunicates, but it has become obvious that he wants the conversations to end only after he has been satisfied, and only if it means he was right. I am fed up with those conversations, he will not compromise with shorter ones or solutions.",1,1751976875.0,relationships,8,0.6,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **UEFA Champions League Qualification: FC Iberia 1999 vs. Malm√∂ FF**  
**Date:** July 8, 2025 | **Time:** 16:00 UTC | **Venue:** TBC

---

### The Setup: A David vs. Goliath of Eastern Europe and Scandinavia

FC Iberia 1999 (Georgia) enters this clash as the plucky underdog, fresh off a **2024 Erovnuli Liga title**‚Äîa feat akin to a Georgia Bulldogs team winning the SEC in the 1980s. Malm√∂ FF (Sweden), the defending Allsvenskan champions, are the seasoned veterans, but their Europa League struggles this season have left them with the swagger of a man who‚Äôs had one too many espressos.

The bookmakers aren‚Äôt pulling any punches: **Malm√∂ is a -150 favorite**, while Iberia is a +500 underdog. That‚Äôs like betting on a man who once won a chess match against a tree. But hey, the tree had a good defense.

---

### The Numbers Game: Implied Probabilities vs. Underdog Rates

Let‚Äôs crunch the numbers with the precision of a spreadsheet-obsessed intern on Red Bull.

* **Malm√∂ (-150):** Implied probability = **60%** (150/(150+100)).
* **Iberia (+500):** Implied probability = **16.7%** (100/(500+100)).
* **Underdog Win Rate in Soccer:** **41%** (per your data).

**Expected Value (EV) for Iberia:**  
EV = (Underdog Win Rate √ó Payout) ‚Äì (Implied Probability √ó Stake)  
= (41% √ó 6.0) ‚Äì (16.7% √ó 1)  
= **2.46 ‚Äì 0.167 = 2.293** (per $1 bet).

That‚Äôs a **229% ROI** if Iberia pulls off the shocker. Malm√∂‚Äôs EV? A pedestrian **(60% √ó 1.6) ‚Äì (40% √ó 1) = 0.56 ‚Äì 0.4 = 0.16**. Not bad, but not worth the caffeine crash.

---

### Key Factors: Why Iberia Might Just Pull It Off

1. **Home Advantage?**  
Iberia‚Äôs home field is in Tbilisi, Georgia‚Äîpopulation: 1.2 million. Malm√∂‚Äôs home field is in Sweden. Let‚Äôs just say the altitude in Tbilisi might give Malm√∂‚Äôs forwards the same energy as a gluten-free muffin.
2. **Malm√∂‚Äôs Europa League Blues**  
The Swedes have looked like a team that forgot to charge their laptops in European competitions this season. Their **Europa League record**: 1W-2L-1D in qualifiers. Not exactly inspiring.
3. **Iberia‚Äôs Title-Winning Edge**  
Winning the Georgian league isn‚Äôt just about skill‚Äîit‚Äôs about surviving ambushes by fans who throw pickled cabbage instead of confetti. That kind of mental toughness? It translates to European nights.

---

### The Playbook: Best Bets & Witty Recommendations

**1. Iberia 1999 to Win (+500)**

* **Why:** The EV is astronomical. At 41% chance vs. 16.7% implied, this is the equivalent of betting on a snowball to survive in a sauna. But hey, sometimes the sauna‚Äôs just not on.
* **Payout Potential:** A $100 bet nets **$500** if Iberia wins. That‚Äôs enough to buy a small Georgian wine cellar.

**2. Both Teams to Score (2.04 Odds)**

* **Why:** Malm√∂‚Äôs attack is inconsistent, but Iberia‚Äôs defense? Let‚Äôs just say they‚Äôre not the New England Patriots‚Äô D-line. The **2.04 line** implies a 50% chance of both scoring. With Malm√∂‚Äôs shaky defense and Iberia‚Äôs title-winning offense, this feels like a coin flip with a 50% chance of landing on its edge.

**3. Avoid the Spread**

* Malm√∂ is -1.0 in most books. That‚Äôs like betting on a Ferrari to beat a go-kart on a racetrack‚Ä¶ but the go-kart‚Äôs driver is named *NASCAR*. Stick to the moneyline.

---

### Final Verdict: Bet on the Underdog, But Don‚Äôt Cry Over Spilled Coffee

While Malm√∂ is the safer pick on paper, **Iberia 1999 offers the best EV** and a shot at glory. If you‚Äôre feeling spicy, stack it with **Both Teams to Score** for a 2.04√ó multiplier.

**Final Prediction:**

* **Iberia 1999 1-1 Malm√∂ FF** (Both teams score, Iberia advances on aggregate).
* **Best Bet:** Iberia 1999 to win outright at +500.

*‚ÄúIn the end, it‚Äôs not the size of the dog in the fight, but the size of the fight in the dog. And Iberia? They‚Äôve got the fight of a man who‚Äôs been told his Netflix is about to cut off.‚Äù* ‚Äî *The Handicapper‚Äôs Guide to Eastern Europe* üá¨üá™üá∏üá™
