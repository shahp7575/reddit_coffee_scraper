Hello everyone! 26M in Adelaide, been here over a year and still on the hunt for friends to actually do stuff with! 🖐🏼

Love early coffee runs, late night chats, trying new food spots, hikes/walks, gaming, shopping, gym or whatever random adventure comes up. Totally open to new things.

Especially keen to connect with chill girls in their 20s who are easygoing and up for grabbing coffee, exploring, or just vibing no pressure, just good company. (Guys welcome too if you’re laid-back and not trying anything weird lol.)

Check my other post for a pic if you’re curious 😉

1qwze7i,https://www.reddit.com/r/RobotVacuums/comments/1qwze7i/a_vent_about_my_roomba_i3/,A vent about my Roomba i3+,"From the bottom of my heart, fuck this stupid piece of shit vacuum.

I bought it a few years ago on Amazon at a previous house. After a few months, I got tired of it having constant issues, getting stuck, the rollers getting tangled with hair and burning up, having parts wear out when it couldn’t even accomplish getting the two rooms it had access to fully cleaned… so after another day of coming home to it being stuck with an error, I put it on the dock unplugged and just started using my regular vacuum.

Flash forward to this past summer… we’ve moved to a new house so I decided to give another shot. I figured new house with a simpler layout might mean it would work better… so I replaced all of the user serviceable parts, cleaned it and the base station up, and then “roomba-proofed” my room to prevent it getting tangled in cords. This vacuum has access to an open concept living and dining room and a sitting room… so not an entire house, just three rooms with a ton of mostly empty space.

For the first few months I would come home and find it wedged behind a couch in the sitting room every other day. I would put it back on the dock and the next day it would finish the previous cleaning job and I’d come home to find it wedged up under the back of my recliner. It would climb up the inclined metal base and get stuck. Eventually I moved an end table so it couldn’t get behind the couch and changed the angle of the recliner so it couldn’t approach from an angle that it could get stuck.

Then I’d come home to find it stuck on the edge of a rug or I’d see someone had moved something in the room and it was stuck in one of its usual spots.

I started looking online for solutions. This thing doesn’t have smart mapping (and I genuinely don’t understand why they can’t add \*some\* rudimentary way to draw barricades to the map the thing makes!). The only “official” option is spending money on “virtual wall barriers”. Battery powered devices that you can put in the room that will keep the roomba away. The idea of having to 1 - place these ugly things around my house, 2 - spend money to fix this kind of issue when the fucking thing should just \*work\*, and 3 - now being on the hook to buy batteries constantly in addition to all of the other parts I constantly have to buy for this thing - made these barriers things an instant no-go for me.

A hack I found online was to stick a couple 3M Command Hooks on the top of the bumper to prevent the vacuum from gutting wedged under stuff… so I did this. And it actually worked (sorta)! The i3 would still find itself in weird situations (teetering with a dead battery on a threshold that it’s crossed plenty of times before with no problem, wedged under things that it approached at \*just\* the wrong angle, etc). Occasionally a Command Hook would pop off and it would get stuck in its usual places. Sometimes I’d come home to find it “lost” looking for the base station or it would be sitting on the vast station at a weird angle with a dead battery, or it would tell me the sensors it contacts were dirty… But usually it would be able to vacuum once a week successfully…

With that said, during all of this, this thing would burn through rollers and brushes on an \*insane\* basis. But it kinda worked better?

Then we got a new dishwasher… and day after day as it worked its way along my kitchen cabinets, it would slide under the front of the dishwasher and a command hook would get stuck behind the door.

My next solution was to get creative. I removed the command hooks and epoxied plastic romex staples to the bumper. Using these, I could now zip tie a section of pool noodle around the front top edge. Now it was too tall to get under any furniture nor the dishwasher. However, now it’s just tall enough to get wedged under my coffee table. Every day I come home and remove it from the coffee table and put it on the dock.

Today at work I got a notification that it was “stuck on a ledge”… and I have no ledges it can get stuck on… When I got home I found it was sitting on the edge of a black rug. Just sitting there ever so barely “hooked” on a really flat rug.

So I’m officially done with this fucking piece of expensive worthless garbage. I’m tempted to take it out into my yard and bash it into a million pieces with my maul. In the three years I’ve owned it, I bet it hasn’t completed a full vacuuming job more than 30 times when I have it set to run daily. I’m not surprised iRobot went bankrupt.

It’s too stupid and too fragile to work reliably. The consumable parts are not durable enough. The lack of options to prevent it from getting stuck are downright offensive. I bought this vacuum so I would spend \*less\* time doing deep cleanings, but it’s so god-damned precious and particular that I have spent far more time babying it back to functionality than I would if I just came home and vacuum my house myself.

I’m just \*over\* it.",1,1770329527.0,RobotVacuums,1,1.0,False

first time purchasing from onyx coffee labs, before this I was a Mostra coffee snob (still kinda am). Im venturing out to try new roasters and this coffee in particular caught my eye based on other reviews. The onyx coffee scale puts this coffee in the expressive light category. This is my first time grinding and brewing a light roast. first of, is it normal for the beans to be grounded and feel like very dry sand? im used to much darker viscous grinds so the color is throwing me off. I had to adjust my grind to be much finer. I am running a Eureka Mignon Zero 65 AP grinder and this coffee is at about a 0-14 grind. 18G of beans in \~36G of coffee out in about 30 seconds. Crema was very thin and on second cup had holes. I dont know if this is coffee quality or what light roast does, but im looking for some guidance here on what I should be seeing. flavor was not strong like a dark roast, but I did notice a berry like profile. should this coffee maybe used for drip instead of espresso?

|Taste|Be as descriptive as possible. Too bitter? Too sour? Thin body?|
|:-|:-|
|Roast date|Look on the bag of beans to find out when they were roasted. This is not the same as a ""Best Before"" date, often seen on bags found in grocery stores. A ""BB"" date is arbitrary and can typically be up to 12 months post-roast.|

 The biggest issue I'm having is that most sources that pop up on google are overseas and I'm looking for a US based source, I also like the idea of grabbing some cool sounding coffee if something strikes a chord while browsing. Obviously price is definitely something I'm considering as well and I've also came across a combo pack of origami filters that include Cone/wave style filters in one pack which would be great. Low free shipping minimum would be icing on the Cake.

To summarize, what's your favorite place to grab some more filters for your Origami dripper online. Would love the combo pack of filters if possible and maybe add some new unique coffee while grabbing the filters. Thanks in advance. ",1,1770329486.0,pourover,0,1.0,False
1qwzd05,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qwzd05,Chaotix season 1; Sonic Cinematic Universe Phase 2: The Heroes Saga; Project 6 (proposal),"CHAOTIX (Limited Series)

Subgenre

Film noir / detective comedy

Longline

When a “Sonic” lookalike commits a slick, high-speed crime spree that threatens to turn the world against its favorite alien hedgehog, a cash-strapped trio of misfit private eyes—the Chaotix—are hired to clear Sonic’s name… only to uncover a shapeshifting con artist (Mimic the Octopus) and a chilling trail of evidence pointing to something even worse: a version of Sonic that moves too perfect to be alive

SERIES ENGINE (What repeats every week)

Each episode functions like a case file with:

A new lead / suspect / location

A noir-style investigation tactic (stakeout, tailing, undercover, interrogation)

A comedy scheme that almost fails

A real clue that tightens the noose around Sonic’s reputation

Every episode opens with Vector’s hardboiled narration in a tiny office… that’s always interrupted by something ridiculous (Charmy drinking the client’s coffee, Espio silently judging everyone, overdue bills sliding under the door).

EPISODE 1 — “CASE FILE: BLUE STREAK”

Cold Open: A high-speed robbery hits multiple locations in minutes. Surveillance shows Sonic—but something’s off. No jokes. No improv. Just… clean efficiency.

Act 1

News explodes: “SONIC’S CRIME SPREE”

Sonic is stunned and furious. Tom & Maddie try to keep him grounded.

G.U.N. goes into containment mode: “If he’s compromised, we have to act.”

Cut to the Chaotix office: Vector tries to look professional while literally using a pizza box as a desk.

Act 2

Chaotix get hired by a nervous client tied to the damage (an insurance rep / small business owner) who says:
“I don’t care if he’s a hero. Someone has to prove it wasn’t him.”

EPISODE 2 — “CASE FILE: THE MAN WHO RAN LIKE SONIC”

Act 1

The crimes escalate: a bank, a convoy, a G.U.N. supply truck.

Public opinion flips fast. Sonic is now a “maybe.”

Act 2

Chaotix go undercover at a black-market meet disguised as:

Vector = “security”

Espio = “silent assassin vibes”

Charmy = “literally in a trench coat pretending to be a grown man”

They spot “Sonic” in the distance and chase.

Act 3

Rooftop pursuit in heavy rain—full noir silhouette energy.

They corner “Sonic”… and it changes faces mid-run.

The first real confrontation with Mimic: He mocks them like an actor mocking bad auditions.

Key Clue
Espio lands a hit that rips away part of Mimic’s disguise:
Octopus-like texture. Shifting skin. Not illusion tech. Biological.

Ending
Mimic escapes, leaving a message:
“Tell your blue hero the city loved him. Past tense.”

EPISODE 3 — “CASE FILE: THE WITNESS WHO NEVER LIED”

Act 1

Sonic starts going stir-crazy in hiding. He can’t stand doing nothing.

Tails tries to prove it scientifically. Knuckles argues it’s honor-based: “This is war.”

Act 2

Chaotix track down a witness who claims they saw Sonic’s eyes during a crime:
“Cold. Empty. Like he didn’t feel anything.”

The witness becomes the key to proving a fake Sonic—but Mimic plays mind games:
He impersonates the witness’s loved one on the phone, manipulating their testimony.

Act 3

Courtroom-adjacent pressure: a formal statement is about to go public.

Chaotix scramble to protect the witness, leading to a tense, hilarious chase through:

a crowded diner

a parking garage

a news crew swarm

Big Reveal
Tails completes analysis of the residue:
It’s consistent with advanced metallic material found in “non-human weapons systems.”
Not a match to Sonic at all.

Ending
Vector says it out loud for the first time:
“So somebody wants them to fear Sonic… and they built something to imitate him.”

EPISODE 4 — “CASE FILE: G.U.N. SMOKESCREEN”

This is the midpoint “everything gets worse” episode.

Act 1

G.U.N. surveillance increases. Roadblocks. Patrol drones.

Sonic is nearly spotted in public and barely escapes.

The world is treating him like a threat.

Act 2

Chaotix investigate the stolen G.U.N. supply truck.

They discover it wasn’t about money — it was about components: high-grade actuators

targeting modules

movement stabilization tech

Act 3

Mimic frames the Chaotix themselves as “accomplices.”

A brutal noir turn: they get detained and interrogated.

Espio stays calm. Vector panics. Charmy nearly ruins everything—
but accidentally reveals a contradiction that saves them.

Ending Twist
Chaotix are released, but now they’re being watched.
And Sonic officially becomes “wanted for questioning.”

The city’s message is clear:
Even if Sonic’s innocent, they’re done trusting him.

EPISODE 5 — “CASE FILE: THE PERFECT FOOTSTEPS”

The “sting operation” episode.

Act 1

The Chaotix set a trap:
leak a fake rumor about a valuable shipment moving through a rail yard.

They want Mimic to show up as Sonic to “prove” Sonic is guilty again.

Act 2

Noir surveillance web: radios, binoculars, rooftop perches.

Mimic arrives—performing Sonic with eerie precision.

The Chaotix record everything… until Mimic reveals he knows it’s a trap.

Act 3

Full chaos action set-piece:

a train yard chase

containers dropping like dominoes 

Mimic shape-shifting mid-fight to confuse everyone

Sonic briefly joins the action—can’t help himself—
and that creates the danger: now there are two Sonics on camera.

Key Moment
Tails notices the difference:

Sonic moves like improvisation

The fake moves like programming

Ending
Chaotix finally corner Mimic and force him to drop the act.
Mimic’s last taunt:
“You really think I’m the scary part?”

EPISODE 6 — “CASE FILE: FEAR SELLS” (Finale)

Act 1

Chaotix present their evidence publicly: Sonic is being framed.

It works… partially.
The city’s response isn’t relief—it’s dread:
“If it wasn’t Sonic… what the hell is out there?”

Act 2

Mimic makes one last play:
he impersonates Sonic in a final, highly visible crime meant to push the world over the edge.

Chaotix race to stop it while Sonic races to save civilians.

This becomes the thematic climax: Sonic proves who he is by what he chooses to do.

Act 3 — Final Confrontation

Mimic is exposed in front of witnesses.

The Chaotix get their win.

Sonic’s name is cleared—but the damage is done:
People now know Sonic can be imitated.

Resolution

Vector’s agency becomes real. Calls start coming in.

Espio accepts the chaos of having a team.

Charmy gets his flowers as a legit hero.

Sonic thanks them, sincerely.
Because they did what the world couldn’t: they believed in him when it was inconvenient.

Final Scene
A quiet moment after the victory:
Tails watches the footage again. That cold movement.
He whispers:
“That wasn’t Mimic’s… that was something else.”

The new model portafilter has a strange design in that it is angled instead of flat which makes it not able to rest on its own upon my Rocky grinder, it just falls off?  so strange they wouldn’t make the little holder on the rocky compatible?   Or am I missing something?

  
Then there’s the dosing into the portafilter which seems like it wants much less coffee than my old porta filter and you shouldn’t be levelling it to the top of the filter but rather somewhere lower.  Then when you try to tamp it, because the basket is on an angle the grounds get tamped at an angle and it just overall feels strange.

  
I am only on Day 2 with this new version after 15+ years of muscle memory with the old one… but has anyone else experienced these things or am I nuts?

 The Chief rushed in, his pistol already drawn. He scanned a miserable scene. The living room was destroyed, and any nice or normal aspect of it was consumed in unholy flesh. Where there once was a ceiling fan, there was a dripping gap. They'd obliterated the ceiling, dropping through it and through the coffee table underneath. Lunch had tumbled further off and landed ass first before the hearth of the family fireplace. The Chief could just make out his left arm and shoulder at the entry angle. His view was blocked by rubble and the Fleshroot’s loose and ample flesh that had splattered and defined the impact. Hunks of it were everywhere. Its stain held the space. Tissue gooped in the Oriental rug. Chutes roped the furniture. It was a crater of stirring slop. The absolute epicenter of the whole chaotic scene? The upturned off-kilter white steel washing machine atop the monster’s digitigrade legs. 

The Chief whispered carefully, “Lunch. Are you alive?”

Lunch made a faint nondead noise and paged his comm. A beep-boop sounded, acknowledging his confirmation. The small visible section of him was twitching back to life. The Chief fanned the room, lowered himself and crept to where he could assess the situation. Lunch was not squished or trapped but there was blood under him. The washer was between Lunch and the monster’s most jumbled collection of extensions. The Chief began a hunched advance when the monster drew in and its tangled core rose. Its chutes lifting dazed and exploring.

The Chief whispered, “Lunch. Can you move?”

Lunch vibrated, shook free a cough and muttered, “Chief-” 

Like a swinging hammer, the large wedged jaw suddenly hurled over the washing machine and chomped down on Lunch’s right clavicle. In a blur, the thing swept a simultaneous swarm of meat for The Chief. He jumped and a smaller dangling maw snapped at him. Its teeth eating only the air, it viciously dipped again for The Chief’s nearest leg and bit his knee.

Lunch erupted. The Fleshroot’s carnivorous teeth not only bit on him but actively chewed its way deeper. Lunch summoned a guttural strength, lodged his feet against the washer and pushed. He forced the odd barrier into the thing with the same mechanical motion of a leg press, using his entire lower body to hold it at bay. He felt the thing losing its grip in him. Its teeth eased out, no longer able to sink. Yet, it gnawed the outermost layer of his skin in a hungry strain, opening his bloody gash wider. 

The Chief rolled over the attacking biter then fired quickly through the lower mandible. The mouth was divided by a lead round nose. The Chief then ripped the hastily knotted tongue of the extension from his knee. Briefly examining himself, he saw it hadn’t penetrated his bunker pants, its teeth too short on his integrated pad. The Chief refocused on the threat. It was a reworking, dissolving mass, sloughing from the dousing of holy water and splattering to the ground. Yet, its many winding limbs held a leaner, enraged poise. 

Upstairs, Papp scrambled to the hose, ready to waterfall the 1st floor as everything became clear and a target could be seen. That’s when the teen’s detached head, scooting ever frantically forward, spoke again, “***HER FLESH, SOWN.****”* Its voice was long and exhausted.

Papp looked down, as the frayed and ugly pieces offered themselves to an expanding puddle of holy water. The tattered, animated appendages gratefully kamikazed it. They sizzled, the meat popping like a skillet full of sausage. Each ounce reduced to shriveled gristle. The head shook with fervor as it neared the same fate. 

The snarled face of the distorted teen, wobbled, shouting, “***SEEDS OF DARK FIRE.****”* 

Papp bent the hose to his elbow, a sudden worried awareness loomed. “***YES***\*”.\* 

He stepped around the head, closer to the bedroom, to where the high steady flames once arched above the teenager’s bed. “***YOU HAVE FIELDS IN YOU TOO.****”* 

There, in the cooked shadowy ceiling was a staved hole. The contents of which was a relative void of blackness, a lightless circle with troubled conceptions. For it was nothing, and also watching from that nothing was a large crimson eye. 

It aimed a woman's familiar scream for Papp. It was hoarse and guttural, and it found his ears with malice. Collin’s head rolled into the holy puddle and he gurgled euphoric, “***YOUR WOE IS MINE TO FILL.****”* 

Papp blasted a stream at the red eye, and yelled into his radio, “Breach! Breach!”

Radios boomed. The call echoed in the house. The Chief's heart rushed, and he cranked out three shots into the girthiest tendrils. The Fleshroot wavered as Lunch wailed in pain to force it back.  Gaining room, he slipped his sweaty hand to his trench knife. He angrily stabbed the engaged neck of it. He jabbed and pried and sliced at the serpentiform muscle fighting him. Scalding hot blood ejected onto his fatiguing bicep. Rhodes appeared at the front door. His horror was hidden only by the sights of his shotgun.

“Rhodes!” The Chief yelled fiercely, his veins popping, “Hold EMS, wait for my signal. Board ready!” 

Upstairs, the breach began expanding. Papp watched as the rippling blackness began to secrete from the hole. It was a decimating lurch of negative light. Papp sprayed it in a backpedal. The woman’s wailing resounded in ache. This light nullification progressed across the ceiling and down the adjacent walls. Papp clocked the smashed window at the far end of the hall, an immediate exit waited on the level ladder outside. He adjusted, pulled slack and ran for the window. When suddenly the hallway ceiling sagged and popped before him. A tangle of grappling chutes crashed through the plaster. “Shit. It’s expanding. Repeat. Expanding fast!”  

Voids of blackness further spread from the hole created, consuming the wall and eclipsing the window. He sprinted back, aiming for the stairs but the darkness had gained from Collin’s room and taken the left side of the hallway. Already it had begun to descend the stairs. “Guys, I’m blocked. No exit.” The radio was silent in response but their tortured screams reverberated from below. He had only one direction left to run.

Papp hurried to the adjacent but not yet overtaken staircase to the 3rd floor. His last radio call buzzed out unsurely, “I’m going to higher ground.”

Lunch shanked wildly again and growled and spit and screamed. The damaged thing swayed in a struggle to force him down. Lunch bullied it back with his powerful legs and its gnawing maw hid in the bundle of appendages. Lunch called again, “Shoot it, Shoot!”

The Chief directed fire into the hunky integral core of flesh, the teen’s body.  Lunch jabbed and jabbed and jabbed, his knife slipping in and out of the foul thing in a fury. All the while a tight slinking extremity coiled over his occupied ankle.  

The Chief cracked a shot into it and a quadrant of appendages slumped. “Now!” The Chief shouted to Rhodes, who was ready with a spine board stretcher. Rhodes rushed in, two horror-struck paramedics warily in tail. That said, they nevertheless stood paralyzed in a chilling realization, as pure darkness descended from the gap above. 

The Chief took a shaky breath, commanding, “Lunch, don’t look at it. Rhodes, board under! Go!” 

Suddenly, Lunch buckled. The washer dropped. 

“Rhodes! Stop!” Lunch bellowed, “Tell Jojo. I love her.”

He wailed in agony as the appendage that’d stealthily coiled up his leg tightened. The tension crushed his medial thigh, breaking his femur against his trapped calf. In an opportune strike, the maw darted from the webby cloak of tubing. It burrowed clean through the smashed clavicle, ripping into Lunch’s chest. Lunch’s whole being was in excruciating hurt. The Chief emptied every bullet he had, cutting and breaking limbs but the coiled appendage had begun its deadly twisting. The Chief and Rhodes watched as Lunch’s leg rotated unnaturally over in its socket and snapped. His legs curled and looped in a complete braid as the bones cracked into fragments. 

Rhodes screamed. He threw down the board, pulled his gun sling and pumped. Shells erupted with lead pellets. Both paramedics disappeared out the door behind them, fleeing to the street. Lunch made one last, desperate look at The Chief before an appendage fluted over his knife clutching hand and began to twist in a brutal corkscrew. The darkness was shrouding the far edges of the room all while also bearing down on them. A new array of shadowed appendages slithered from the opening overhead. Lunch had his eyes closed, passed out from the pain or dead. Rhodes regretfully stared as Lunch's ragdolled leg entwined with his thick pants and wringed out a pulp of thigh fluids. 

The Chief yanked Rhodes’ collar, “Get out!” 

Rhodes' derangement overtook his motor functions and he couldn't fathom anything beyond killing the mass of flesh. The Chief wrestled him back, the blackness pursuing their very steps. 

Rhodes screamed, “No! Fuck! Fuck! Michael!”

Lunch’s comatose head began its own twisting, until the neck bucked back and wrenched. Snap. The vertebrae separated and hatched through his nape as the head kept rotating until it dangled on a firelit sapling of fleshroot. Black buried the room and Lunch’s mutilated body as they tumbled onto the porch. The sweep of blotting evil budded up to the marked symbols placed by The Chief. Its spread was contained at the threshold, as a sightless void of death. 

Rhodes was overwhelmed with aggression. The Chief fought to restrain the young firefight, hitting him mercifully into the ground. 

The Chief yelled, “Stop it! Rhodes, quit. Look at me!” There was a dying squirm of small jerks and shoves. And from a growing cognizance of reality, Rhodes pulled The Chief’s chest on his eyes as he began to sob.  

**PART IV**

The preacher quoted his verses, reanalyzing all that’d occurred from his perspective: The chaotic destruction. The desperate cries. 

***I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as a robe and a diadem…*** 

The home was a dying ember. Its windows all but painted black - the solid dark, plunging cliffs on the sills. Rhode was in emotional arrest within The Chief’s arms. 

***I was eyes to the blind and feet was I to the lame***\*\*.\*\* 

The preacher heard the doppler of multiple helicopter blades on approach. 

The preacher whispered into his comm, “Papp? Can you hear me?”

“This is Kilo-Tango-Charlie, Seven-Eight-Two Load.” The detached voice of a pilot bid for permission. “Ready confirmation, is the structure clear? Over.” 

Tires, alarms. Neon green hazmat response units triangled the property, sealed white suits marched out in rows.

***I was a father to the poor…***

Portable barricades circled the property. The Chief clasped the radio, “No. Hover, HFD inside. Over.”

***and the cause which I knew not I searched out.***

The detached voice replied, “Breach protocol. Designate proof for precise countdown. Over.”

Gloved hands pulled The Chief and Rhodes from the small yard and behind the expanding barricade. He replied in stumbling, “Steven Papp, last communication at eighteen minus current. Over.”

“Roger, taking form - powder at twelve. Over.” The invisible hand began its ticking. The preacher could just barely make out the heavy-lift copter on the horizon, turreted Little Birds were flocking close behind. 

The preacher tried again, “Papp? Answer me, you’re short on time.”

The preacher slipped his hands down the hydrant’s outlet and over the nylon jacket of the hose. He looked up the ladder that ran to the second floor window and noticed an excess loop. The preacher, muttering his verses still, hurried to the top of the truck - making sure to remain in contact with the hose.

The Chief pinged the preacher, “Reverend, careful. He needs your prayers now more than ever.”

The preacher squatted, draping the hose over his shoulder. He yanked it. It pulled taut, after only a foot of give. It found resistance, then it began to recede back up the ladder into the pitch black window.  The preacher pulled again, and again it pulled steadily back. Again he tugged and again it tugged away, back inside. 

“Chief!” The preacher exclaimed. 

The preacher turned to see that he had the attention of the mask obscured containment team, the paramedics and Palmer, The Chief and a blurry-eyed Rhodes too.

“Reverend, we see.” The Chief replied. “But, before you get excited… Well, we can’t know for certain what you’re playing with there.” 

The preacher watched as white gloved hands rushed to pull him down from the truck and in reflex he jumped several rungs of the ladder. The Chief scraped his teeth against his upper lip and stated protocol, “Entering a sealed breach is forbidden. Exit only. As the structure is deemed condemned, the city of New Mary accepts no responsibility for-” 

“He’s alive!” The preacher interrupted, continuing up the rungs.

He reached the top of the ladder as the white glove containment crew staggered to the turntable below.  The preacher quoted the scripture aloud, *“****Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter. If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace-****”*

The Chief wavered then nodded respectfully. Over the radio, The Chief announced, “Load. Updated proof, Reverend Phillip O. Morris. Sight reset 0 minus to 30 minutes. Over.”

The heavy-lift pilot responded immediately, “.5 to impact, final. Over.”

  

The preacher had some additional time but it was fleeting. He could not hesitate, even face to face with a wood framed abyss. It was such a severe separation of that which was outside its grasp and the compacted unbeing evil. He took a deep breath as he slid his figure over the hose and shattered glass about the sill. A shaky hand pierced the black. All of a sudden the crowd below watched as the preacher tumbled in with a swift, unnatural plunge.

**PART V**

The preacher’s back hit the floor, quickly he righted himself. He could see his own extremities and his chest and the floor and close sections of the hall walls but he was now paces from the black wall he had just briefly touched. He looked back outside and the world was there and visible.

***He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.*** 

He prayed in a step forward. Blackness closed in behind him and the wild outside world was gone and silent. The preacher tried the radio, “Chief?” He waited. “Rhodes. Papp. Anyone?”

There was no response.

***I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust.***

The preacher took two more precarious steps forward until he realized the darkness was adjusting around him. Advancing on the blackness only pushed it further from him, like it was retreating from his very aura. Yet too, it filled in behind him hungrily.

The preacher had a few feet's grace in any direction. This small sphere of order was not dark but not lit. It was as if the space was temporarily relinquished for his passing. But, with his progression came an unsettling, sickening noise. It was a heavy dragging with the odd slippery thump of things pulled up and over and dropping back to the floor. 

***Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence.***

He kept going despite the audible alien shifting but its verbal greeting gave the preacher pause. A brittle but known voice named him, “Phillip”

The preacher recognized it as a bastardization of that voice who’d time-aplenty spoke at late hours of the night. The preacher made his voice loud and recited. \*\*“\*\****Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day; Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.”***

He marched past the massive gap from Lunch’s attack, daring not to look into the opening and splashed in a rivulet coming down the staircase. Waves of water fell from each step in his ascension. As the darkness retreated, a waterfall became perceivable. In the corner, on the half landing was a geyser of water pelting the ceiling and ricocheting down as a gushing column. Inside said water column was the hose’s end. The preacher hesitantly approached this obscene thing and tugged on the hose sharply.  The column of water wobbled, slitting his shield for a brief insightful moment. 

Papp closed the line to a weak dribble, exposing his cautious crouch.

The oxygen tank hissed as he vented the SCBA and removed his fogged mask. He peeled it from his porous face and rubbed his perpetually tired eyes. Papp’s gear was completely soaked through, hat to boot he wore a sheen. He took a long deep breath, looked up and asked, “Lunch, did he make it?”

There was little hope in his urgent question, like he’d answered it himself several times over.

“No.” The preacher responded without delay or equivocation. He’d learned it was best in times of grief to be blunt. “He’s gone. I’m sorry. Rhodes and The Chief are safe.”

Papp didn’t say anything, he just sat a moment looking into his pruney shivering hands. The preacher moved closer but Papp stopped him before he could provide his dutiful comforts. Papp cursed. He smacked his helmet on the soggy wall. He then squirmed and squished, stripping from his outer layers, asking, “ETA for containment?” Papp went right to training, planning, but he spoke with an upset snarl that wavered to a frown when he looked away.  

The preacher spoke softly, “Containment is outside. Helicopters are almost here. They reset time to my entry, maybe two minutes ago.”

Papp’s face was tightly drawn in a silent struggle. His cheeks were dripping, and The preacher wouldn’t believe not one was a tear. 

“Papp, we can talk. Lunch was my friend too.” The preacher dared. 

Papp just wringed out his undershirt. He looked to the descending stairs then checked the path further up. “Let’s move. Which way?” 

Papp shook his wristwatch, dialed a timer. “What’s upstairs?” The preacher said looking only steps ahead, where the shroud of blackness blinded. 

“Well, add it up. Abandoned first floor. Those boys' rooms on the second floor were bare. No hoodoo herbs. No candles. No Ouija boards. Nothing for a summon. Final floor, I figure, we’ll find the stupid fucker who opened hell.”

Papp redressed but fully stripped to his vital gear and abandoned what was dangerously waterlogged or otherwise destroyed and useless. His turnout coat, a pair of gloves, his backup maglite and the air tank were jetsoned. 

The preacher contemplated his response. He considered turning tail long enough to pray, **“Oh, For the sake of your name, Lord, forgive my iniquity, though it is great.”** 

Papp nudged the morally flummoxed preacher, shifting the darkness to equip a carefully lain and dry shotgun. He then unzipped his waist mounted cold pack and began to load iron slugs. He reproached the holy man, “It would haunt you.”

Papp pointed to his heel and stepped ahead. The preacher took to the spot and followed upward, dragging the hose. The preacher regretfully asked his baffled questions, “That’s it? You’re worried for my conscience?”

“Maybe your morals are all that keeps us breathing now, Preach. You turn back, hesitate and abandon our grieving widow up above, maybe we implode what little grace we have.”

The preacher rubbed his neck and spoke with suspicion, “How upstanding. And you have no incentive for justice? A summoning on top of two murder charges, Jane’s looking at life in prison.”

Papp met the accusation, “And she deserves to live it.”

Papp and the preacher hammered tread, each shuffling at the other’s cautious pace. They took file with intentionality, like the staircase was freshly painted and they were carrying an armoire. It was no more than six steps in this dependent state before the preacher tried to engage Papp’s feelings again. “Lunch was the first one to greet me on my first day.” 

He yanked the hose with a white knuckled strain. Papp marched ahead unperturbed, unresponsive. The preacher chuckled to himself, “He was wearing that tank top he made, with the breast cut out. Two big holes and his hairy man-nipples hanging out…” Papp stopped his ascent. “Never even acknowledged it. Bugtoe, had him bet for a twenty that I’d leave immediately.” 

The preacher laughed softly. “I was so nervous and so tense starting off. Lunch fixed that.” 

Papp turned and looked at the preacher with a solemn stare.  “Lunch died.”

“Yes.” The preacher responded. 

Papp bobbed his head, sighing. “Fuck.”

The preacher touched Papp’s forearm. Unwilling to curse, he simply replied, “I agree.”  

Papp composed himself and looked ahead. “Thank you. For coming in, for me.”

“I would’ve missed you too.” The preacher said to the back of his helmet. 

They continued up the stairs together. When they reached the landing no walls or ceiling infringed on the small holy orb. They spoke over the newel like it were a buoy in a night sea. “Which way now?” Said the preacher. 

Papp tried to hone in on something to guide them, to find a reason to move any direction in the oppressive darkness. “Pass me the hose.” 

They sorted the line and Papp opened the valve wide enough to blast water several feet into the black ahead of him. The preacher spoke his praises soft as Papp slowly swept the stream. There was an abrupt and horrendous screech. The hidden inhabitant of the void panicked and tumbled and slipped in a tangled retreat. The shrillness of the screech died out with distance. 

Papp announced, “This way.”",2,1770329115.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

**PART I**

Modern high-rises and traffic exhaust guard the handsome Old Edwards Fire Company in New Mary’s Downtown. Ol’ Ed was originally constructed in 1956 by the city’s local bricklaying and masonry chapter. The orange brick was harvested in the nearby quarry and was set to gorgeously sink subtle warmth below a gothic facade of webbed terracotta. Its crowning jewel, its fire mark. A sculpture of a lioness bathing between its reinforced bay doors. Though it now stands as the sole structure of just two stories for 15 blocks, Ol’ Ed’s short face is highly regarded for its precious architectural detailing and artistry, and so, is therefore deemed a historical landmark by the state preservation office. With the determinant stipulation of it forever proudly serving the city’s bravest heroes, New Mary’s HFD (NMHFD).

 

“Christ, Lunch. Pinch it off already.” Rhodes said, tap dancing with his legs crossed

.

“I’m pushing a grapefruit.” Lunch moaned back, bracing himself. 

“Flush. Goddamn it, Lunch!” Rhodes shouted and punched the bathroom door. 

The Chief called from the dining room. “What’s going on?” 

“Lunch has been making the mud for forty minutes.” The young firefighter tattled. 

“I’mma make a smiley face.” Lunch taunted, wiggling on the seat.

Rhodes stormed through the dormitory, and kicked open the exit door.

“Jesus, alright I’m pissing in the alley.”

Three men occupied the small, adjacent dining room that the fumes slowly wafted toward.

The preacher plugged his nose, “Blessed, Lord. Help these men. They’re degenerates."" 

Papp stuck his head out from the pantry, “What was that, Thumper?” 

The preacher squeaked the beginning of a retort, but then instead sheepishly sucked at his coffee’s brim. He sat opposite of The Chief in the well-lived common room. The decor was a mesh of amenities from the 90s that made it feel exactly like a family living room: warm vinyls and subtle lights, a collection of donated wood furniture, a fine knit geometric rug trampled to clumps. The Chief sat postured and aligned some reports on the old oak table. “Cool it, Papp.” He said without a glance.

Papp garbled his apologies, “Sorry, Chief.”

“Reverend.” The Chief continued, “Thank you for doing the dishes.” 

“Welcome.”

Lunch boomed in triumphant release, “Mother of New Mary! God is good, Papp. God is good!”

The preacher muttered, “You gentlemen truly need a revival. Does God's name mean nothing?” 

Papp rolled his perpetually tired eyes, gave the man of God a nonchalant bird, and returned to finding his sugared cornflakes. “This bread’s expired. Bananas stink. Does anything keep in here?” 

The preacher sniffed and was immediately stifled. Struggling to inhale, the preacher asked, “How’s the young man related to Lunch again?”

Papp replied, “Brother-In-Law.”

“Ah, Johanna’s little brother. When was he procured?”

Lunch called out from the can, “He ain’t a lil’ squishy, just transferred off a spot ladder.”

The Chief commented, confidently, “9 months listed. No official errors. No infractions.”

“Johanna’s idea of protecting you?” The preacher inquired.

Lunch ripped a fart into the bowl in response. “Yeah, right. That’s backwards!” 

The Chief flexed the papers, snapped them stiff and read with a squint, 

“Papp, you check the pumps? Clean the hose bed?” 

Papp said proudly. “Hit it early, Chief. Pulled stacks, sanitized, cross-laid back with loops. Done and done.” 

The Chief tufted an acknowledgement. Papps poured breakfast into a bowl and saddled a chair. The Chief stood to attention, made his way at Lunch, and hammered the bathroom door with a single solid blow.  He commanded, “Lunch, reloads on 1 and check the tanks.”

Lunch grunted “Aye, Aye.” 

The Chief coughed, “And maybe change up your diet, son.”

Lunch replied breathlessly, “Sorry but I got to purge. Can’t take this diesel with me.”

The Chief hung his head briefly before stepping away. “Yo, Bossman, can we get another crapper?” Lunch asked with a muted flush, “We got too many kings, not enough thrones.” 

The Chief evenly replied, before making toward his office, “Again. No. Ol’ Ed is all natural.”

Papp waited until The Chief rounded the corner, then cheekily asked. “Preach, your Ma’s all natural, right?” 

The alarm rang. 

A repeating double beat filled the station. The robotic enunciation of E147 and a staticky jumbled response location followed, a trailing alert on the LED board read clear. *E147 Beal Street, Residential Fire.* A voice from emergency dispatch followed, “At this time, full crew orders for a single family three story. EMTs onsite.” 

Papp raced to the slide pole. He clutched the metal bar and the preacher watched his head swiftly dip below the floor. The preacher briskly slipped into the dormitory. He removed his tie then pulled a silver chain laced Bible from his bunk and followed promptly down the stairs. The bathroom door flew open. Lunch fell out his stench, tumbling to the stairs and snapping his loose suspenders into place. 

Rhodes had the bay open, and secured the driver’s seat before Lunch could protest. The Chief was booting up and taking watch as everyone entered the truck. Papp kicked in an inventory compartment and swung open the cab. Lunch hiked up and pulled the preacher. The Chief took the front passenger’s seat and hit the lights. Headsets on. Rhodes tugged the rope, blasting the air horn. The Chief flipped the siren. They turned clear through 6 lanes, and it was “Engine 147 in route.” 

“What’s local medicine looking at?” Lunch asked over the radio.

“Talking to them now, hold tight.” The Chief dismissed, before tuning back to the main channel. 

“Wait. No Bugtoe today?” Lunch questioned Papp, who was sitting in the transverse seat.

Papp pulled the mic to his mouth, “Nah, he’s home. Man did 24 straight for E108, backfill for that 

Charles guy.” 

Lunch scrunched his face. “Charles who?” 

“The one that died.” Papp replied.

The preacher, who sat across the aisle with the gear, turned his head at attention. “What Charles died? Ain’t no Charles at the 108.”

Papp rolled his lip out. “Not no more. They responded to a Ringforker at a bank on Kings last week. Made him manic, then his heart stopped.” Suddenly, the preacher’s eyes widened. Papp went on, “You sure you didn't know this dude? They all called him something stupid.” 

Rhodes enlightened him, arms extended on the large steering wheel, “He’s talking about Clod, their special ops man.” 

“Oh shit, yeah I knew him.” Lunch put his greasy palm on his scalp and pushed his long wiry hair back. He squeezed his temples and shook his head in shock, “Fuck, he died? Great dude. Hell of an axeman. Strong as shit. Ya know, they used to shut down the city for a tragedy like that.” 

Papp slouched to a window and watched the red lights wash out passing faces. He traced the citizen’s motion blurred dread. “Fourth gone this year. No one wants another memorial. We’re just reminders now.” 

The preacher thumbed through the chain-link on his Bible to touch the heat resistant wool undercoating. “It’s getting worse.” He said, the words heavily dropping out of him. 

Papp turned to the preacher but asked Lunch, “You know if 108 is open to swapping preachers?” 

Lunch chuckled, “Lay off the holy man now. Body and soul, he’s gentle.” 

Papp gave the preacher a look of disgust, “He called us degenerates earlier.” 

“Well I am.” Lunch grinned, winking. “The freshmen up front too, devilish and sly. Taking my turn in the fun seat, brother?”

“You can drive on the way back.” Rhodes chimed in. “Unless Papp wants a go?” 

“Pass.” Papp shot back.

Lunch leaned sideways and nudged the preacher. “Hey, Preacher.”

“Yes.” He replied evenly.

“Hypothetical for you. I’ve got a gun to my head. I need you to say a slur to save my life, would you do it?” The preacher looked at him bewildered. “Look, right. I know about those missionaries that like to die before renouncing their faith. That’s cool, I respect it. You do that, I get it. But would you say some crazy racist shit about like… Guatemalans? You know, to save my life.” Papp studied Lunch, while Lunch waited for a response. “You don’t have to mean it, you’d just have to say it.” The preacher was absolutely stunned by the question. 

Then the engine bounced off the connecting bridge and The Chief announced, “One minute out. Cut the chatter.” He turned to make eye contact with the darkened cab. “Focus up. EMTs have one civilian out in a shocked condition, maybe three more believed inside. Teenager on the second story, parent on the third.”

Comms went quiet after that. The preacher went into The Word. Lunch sent a few cautious texts to his usual people. Papp went back to the window, watching the local police coming into view. They scurried to set a perimeter. One of the officer’s gave him a firm nod, Papp nodded back absently. Rhodes pulled the truck down a one-way bend and their cherry reflections rose and sank, up/down and back against the transitioning glass panes of emptying businesses and apartment buildings.

Coming off the corner, they dumped onto a burning glow. Down the initial set of fetching 3-flats, facing the shrub fenced park, was a building made of flames. The heat dominated the air and rose as they barreled headlong to arrive. They walled off the ambulance from the house in a swift swinging park and all the doors opened in sync. Papp and Rhodes, exiting closest to the home, briefly paused together. They looked up stone steps to the small white front door in a rage of pure flames. 

“Whole things burning. No smoke.” Rhodes commented. 

“Yeah, it’s ours.” Papp decided.

As his boots hit the asphalt, The Chief barked orders. “Compartments open. Rhodes, you’re on hose. Tap the hydrant. Rig down, boom up. No movement without a pin test. Papp and Lunch you're knocking. Reverend, standby, coat and hat please.” The Chief marched over to a soot smothered child being comforted by EMTs. 

The men each went to lift and roll out a compartment. Rhodes got the spanner wrench. The preacher adorned a thick repellent cloak and helmet stitched and etched respectfully with a Celtic cross. Papp and Lunch dressed in standard HFD turnouts: helmet and eye shield, particulate blocking hoods patterned in daisy wheels, breathing apparatus (with tanks), and heather lined protective coats packed with personal quick equipment. Lunch inserted a brass key into the back of the truck and pulled down the weapons compartment. Racked on the galvanized panel were four pump action shotguns, multiple wire mesh cages below were filled with munitions. 

Papp clocked Rhodes’ shadow spreading below him as the boy ascended the ladder. “Pressure!” 

Rhodes shouted, shifting the valve handle. A second later the hose kicked, wriggled and gushed with water. Rhodes drenched a single flaming spread for a few moments and the crew watched anxiously. The Chief moved briskly back to them and motioned for Rhodes to kill the stream. Rhodes hit the shut-off and the spout went to a drip. As gushing water fell off, it revealed the fire raging unabated. The small square that was blasted had remained ablaze, the water had no effect. 

“Reverend, please assist.” The Chief requested. 

The preacher widened the silver chain necklace to adorn his Bible. He purposefully made his way to the hydrant. The preacher then closed his eyes. Bowing his head, he placed both hands on the bonnet and began to request blessings. The Chief pointed to Rhodes and the water cannon blasted once again. This time the blistering flames washed away with a simple passing. The home beneath was revealed, entirely undamaged.

“Nice work, Jesus wizard.” Lunch yelled in earnest. 

Rhodes made a quick rinse of the porch, taking the heat off their entrance. The flames disappeared without a hazy film or wavy smoke, only white sizzling bubbles. The door held, as it should, completely unaffected by the fire - inviting as ever. 

“Chief, anything from the kid?” Papp asked. 

“Nothing concrete. He’s shaken, nonverbal. EMTs only got him to nod. Mother and older brother are confirmed inside. No mention of the father.” 

“Names?”

“I’ve asked dispatch for a bio on the family. Waiting.”

Lunch pointed to the munition boxes, “Shells?” 

The Chief noticed his doubt, answering, “Load salt, full lead in a bando. Papp, slugs in a cold pack. Bring a hitter. I’ll be on exit duty.” Lunch reached over Papp, tugged a drawer and pulled out a trench knife. Papp crossed over him to retrieve the axe. The Chief equipped his fire retardant Wildland and stowed a small arm in his holster. Rhodes fanned a protective mist and the preacher dutifully muttered his prayers. 

They were ready to enter. 

**PART II**

Papp and Lunch took cautious steps to the front door, glancing inside the ornate green glass pane sidelights. Lunch pressed down on the gold plated handle and the door tamely opened. Both men were silent in their confusion for the eerily undisturbed bottom floor of the home. It wasn’t smoking of course. But also there was no fire, no heat. It seemed to ultimately be untouched by what was sure to be within. However, they recognized something more solemn about the space. They stood in the short foyer, an open L shaped kitchen to their right and a dimly lit living room to their left. The furniture was expensive. The interior design, that of the typical upper middle. Yet all of it was abandoned and cluttered. Like, no one had cleaned in months. It was difficult to see the floor in the mess; some of it was household trash, some thrown clothes, some mail. What little floor was visible, was caked in grime.

Lunch announced, “HFD Fire Rescue! Come out. We are here to help!”

The adjoined space made no reply, if anything it felt as if the house withdrew and became quieter. Lunch stepped in further, his heavy boots creaking the natural teak and shuffling garbage. Papp flanked twisting, scanning the nearest rooms and their shadowing corners and halls. In doing so he saw the ribbon wrapped frame on the dusty living room mantle. It was a stoic portrait of a suited middle-aged man. He had a high tight trim, becoming eyes and a sharp jawline. The man’s name was on a slab below, Clive Fraley. In a smaller 8x10 just next to it was the full family photo. The background was the classic brushed blue backdrop. It was the memorialized stoic dad, a hip-tied shorthaired blonde woman, a pale bulky teenager with a sad scowl and the child outside, only clean and smiling pearls. Papp, following a trail of wilted petals, found a blackened bouquet slumped by an open urn. 

“Chief. Found a name, Clive Fraley.” Papp called softly.

The Chief was chocking the front door when he looked up and traced Papp’s concern. The Chief furrowed, flatly replying, “Yeah, we’ll assume the father’s passed. Possible summon, I’ll call it in.” He turned to another radio channel and stepped onto the porch. 

The two firefighters inside pressed on. Lunch called out again, “HFD Fire Rescue!”

Entering the living room, they could now see the orange firelight spilling from the angled staircase along the far rear wall. At the landing, they could see a flight of untouched stairs and a perfectly horizontal ceiling of raging flames. Lunch spoke into his radio, “Vent and douse the center window on the second floor.” 

“Copy”, Rhodes replied.

Rhodes adjusted his aim and tightened the dial. The water funneled in from a wide shower to a powerful hydro jet, shattering the target window. The mechanical ladder whined as he sent it forward, Rhodes steadied the bucket and flushed the upstairs hallway with holy water. With each droplet the unnatural fire peeled away and vanished in a sizzling steam. Rhodes cut a path to the stairs, ricocheting a scatter from the railing. He reset the bail and called back, “2nd floor hall clear.”

Rhodes watched the preacher and acted on his curiosity while Papp and Lunch ascended inside, “You able to talk while you do that?”

The preacher politely consented, “So long as my concentration is unbroken, I can.”

Rhodes tapped his chest strapped radio and faintly inquired, “What’s up with Papp? You two got history?”

The preacher responded head locked downward, “From what I know he has always had a grievance with people of faith. I am simply the nearest.”

Rhodes opened the dial and rained down on the house once again. “He’s saying some pretty rude shit. You ok? Want me to rough him up?” Rhodes asked, in playful concern.

“More than okay. No horseplay on my account. There are better ways, Private Rhodes.” The preacher said with a slight consideration. 

“Happy to hear it. Wasn't sure I could take an ex-cop.” Rhodes admitted.

“Papp was a policeman?” The preacher asked in mild surprise.

 “Oh, yeah. Lunch told me. Discharged beat cop to HFD.” Rhodes said nonchalantly. The preacher recognized the new information by emitting a light intrigued hmm. Rhodes concurred with a shrug before his next question, “Scripture question for you, Mr. Preacher. Why no smoke?”

The preacher bobbled his head in the manner long debated, over-examined, and stale topics can incite, “When I meet God I will ask that myself.”

“Venture a theory?” 

“Of my interpretation and a prevalent understanding in my church-” The preacher creaked out.

“There is no smoke in hell because it was never intended for consumption. Hellfire burns solely to cause pain, to let the fire burn out would be a relief in a place without relief.”

The Chief hollered over the radio, “E3014 will be here in 25 with a containment truck. Proceed with extraction, use extreme caution. Listen. Dispatch came back with family names. Father: Clive Fraley, two months deceased. Mother: Jane Fraley, inside. Eldest Son: Collin, inside, age 16. Youngest Son: Palmer, outside with paramedics, age 6. Neither Jane nor the children have been to work or school since the father’s passing.” The Chief signaled to Rhodes before hiking over a flowerbed with a paint pen and bucket of salt.

Papps and Lunch pinged back, “Roger. On the second floor now.”  

The flames were mostly defeated and the upstairs hall was clear. Sounds of sizzling faded as the water set. Rhodes and Papp progressed shoulder to shoulder, minding the small fires clinging to their dry nooks where the hose hadn’t hit. The hall runner squelched with their steps.

Lunch shouted for them, “Jane! Collin! FHD Rescue, please respond!”

Behind Papp was another angled staircase to the third floor. They passed a bedroom, door ajar. Tonka trucks and action figures lined the base boards. Rocket ships were on the wallpaper and bedspread. Vacant. Lunch designated it as the youngest child’s room. Halfway down the hall, Papp slid open a pair of accordion doors to reveal a washer and dryer closet. They then turned in unison at the door opposite and tried the knob.

Even through his glove, Papp felt the painful temperature. “Locked. Inner walls lit.” He announced. 

Lunch cupped the radio, “Rhodes, hose through the window. We’re gonna drawbridge a lit room.”

Rhodes turned, shuffled down the ladder and asked the preacher to kill pressure. On his descent, Rhodes noticed The Chief on all fours back at the front door, he wielded the paint pen determinately. He was remarkably focused on finishing his wide curving symbol at the threshold. The preacher leaned all his weight into the spanner and the hose deflated. Rhodes yanked on the stack, got slack and proceeded back up the ladder. 

By the time he was back to the window Papp had a Halligan wedged in the upper hinge. Lunch crashed into the shaft and the wood split clean. Escaping flames jumped from the small crack overhead.

Rhodes signaled, “Hose coming in.”

Lunch quickly walked down the hall and met him at the window. He flicked the young firefighters visor and laughed, “Thanks kid.”

Rhodes adjusted himself and began to feed the line as Lunch moved into stance. Papp teed up the Halligan again and equipped his axe before stepping to the door’s side, “Ready.” 

“Preach.” Lunch directed. “Pressure and a prayer.”

The girthy hose swelled and the preacher replied humbly, “Okay.” 

 

Papp nodded to Lunch. His axe butt swung high, dropped in and drove the claw deep. He crouched, grasped the long arm of the Halligan and pulled back. The bottom hinge snapped and the door broke off the wall. The door stood, briefly, balancing on the wood floor. Lunch opened the hose and blasted the top of the door as flames erupted out, he then kicked high on the freed door and soaked it as it collapsed inward. 

Lunch drenched the floor and extinguished the nearest flames. He pinched the line at the bail as the steam cleared. Papp clipped his entry tool to his hip mounted cradle and stood, axe in hand. He tapped Lunch and stepped before him, announcing with a square designation, “HFD Fire Rescue.”

The sleeping section of the bedroom was tucked just off a lefthand half-bath. And so, it remained obscured in high and steady flame. While the other section was a mush mound of wet food, trash and clothes. The hose soaked bulbous, sagging pockets of water into the wall paint. A PC monitor flickered out. Band posters turned to a grey pulp on the hardwood. Papp did a visual sweep. Making assumptions of the boy whose safe haven he infiltrated. He saw drawing pens, a basketball. And, oddly, a string of smashed pictures and trophies on a small desk. He turned to face the flaming bed.

With some scrutiny, he tragically identified a mass. There, in the engulfed mattress was something the rough dimensions of that teenager pictured downstairs.  Disappointment on his face, he fanned Lunch in to extinguish the corpse. However, he swiftly held up a straight halt signal as he heard a heavy thud.

There were another two dense thumps of things longer and lower to the floor. Followed by a clapping and scratching that was frantic and strained. Papp braised, raising his axe as they crawled out the fire. 

A filleted arm pulled itself on bright blisters, bulging under splitting nails. It was severed from a shoulder, a person, but fleeing desperately toward Papp. Like the other skinless arm, another quivered and scraped from the flames. The disembodied appendages moved with an agonizing tremor to his slowly retreating feet, an ooze of blood trailed from their twisted rip wounds. Papp stealthy sheathed his axe on his free hip cradle and pulled out his shotgun. Lunch stamped in just as the head rolled out from under the burning bed. 

It was the Collin’s cooking head, severed and wobbling forward on its side. The lower cheek was a sludgy stretch of flesh that squished as it rocked. His eyes were not the pair pictured earlier. They were ash rimmed and nearly doubled in size, bulging with blood. Two protruding oblong tomatoes sinking in a horrid grey pit locked onto Papp. There were quick rapid breaths coming from the mouth.

It gasped and spoke gauntly, “***RICH***”. It groaned, pulling itself along the ground with a flex of its jaw. The head bounced closer, drooling, it grumbled, “***SOIL.***”

Right then, Lunch was ready to turn water on the body pieces. When from out the flames of the burning bed, a wedge-shaped pit of teeth undulated on a long outstretched neck. Without warning it placed a winding mesh of meaty tubulars to the floor and thrust its body at Papp. 

Papp leapt straight back and hip-fired a shot into it. 

Salt exploded into the thing, white dots scattered into a sizzle on the rising hulk of it. Unflinched, the fullness of it dropped to the floor and the house shook, bowing in its terror. Its obscured proportions shifted into a grandly dense strata of bloody tissue. It was cinched on hooked talons that drove cuts with each step. Its exposed heel bone jutted through its warped flesh to a jagged pike, like a predatory animal with a gruesome compound fracture. It had a hardened pack of flesh looped from out and back in its sinewy center mass that swung brutally down to try to crush Papp. 

He leapt back, further to the corner, narrowly escaping the deadly blow.  

As it rallied momentum for another swipe, Papp saw its center mass more clearly. It was the burly teenager's suspended torso, overturned and utterly ruptured. Guts dangled from a burrowed belly cavity. The malicious wrapping of tissue on pulsing muscle had ripped through Collin's torso like the roots of a grisly meat tree on fleshy soil. It was a system of sick chutes, barded and burnt and, in some places, chomping. Like the tumultuous mating balls of venomous snakes… but on fire. The smallest of its extensions were razored tendrils, sprung from the thinnest skin tears of his abdomen. The monster's raw fire basted mass and the dying stumps of the pieces viciously torn away were woven into a single clotted knot.

The Chief’s steady voice buzzed, “Status. Report on discharge.”

Papp replied indistinctly, “Fleshroot. Call birds. It’s huge.”

The Chief radioed immediately, “Sigils set. Retreat.”

Nervously, Papp saw his exit shrinking as it lumbered forward. The Fleshroot’s heaviness, it’s wild incessantly wiggling limbs - it was primed to engulf him. The instantaneous ejection of holy water was an audible blessing.

A tight wet cord drilled into the meat mass and from the swinging maw-like wedge it screeched noxiously. Lunch screamed, “Move out!” while resisting the hose's kick. 

A raging blast escaped the dialed valve. It was set at two inches in diameter. Its most focused,  most weaponized setting. The nozzle pressure was high enough to slit the skin of a man. At the right distance, it was sufficiently lethal to people. To an infernal brute, it was a high powered laser capable of eternal nonexistence.

Papp hardly had time to chamber another shell before it happened. A bursting block of angry flesh rushed Lunch at the door, pushing against the stream of holy water as its layers of red writhing meat steamed and popped. Boiling hot water exploded in every direction. Lunch recoiled to the hallway, spraying desperately. But, it was too dense, too late. From a fizzling mist, the monster lunged feral, crumbling the doorframe to a rubbled gap. In quick succession, the Fleshroot charged. It rammed Lunch, sending a full geared 250lb man careening into the tall white washing machine across the hall. It pushed, bore down on him. Meaty channels sieged his arms and coiled for his throat. Lunch squirmed and kicked, his body weighed on by near tons while under the gushing stew of broiling demonic tissue. His wails of pain were relieved only by the echoing blast of Papp's shotgun. 

Papp punched a hole into the monster’s assumed back, rapidly pumping; he fired another shot to fill the hole with ejected pellets of hot salt. The Fleshroot screeched louder, steam wafting from the tangled form. In a rage, it released Lunch and hurled its looping extension of chutes backward, hitting Papp’s chest and knocking him stunned and sliding. Lunch, rickety, concussed, and gasping, found footing, and pushed the nozzle further to it. Steam fogged his visor, its running juices bathed his gear and sautéed the small gap of exposed skin under his gaiter. Visibility was low, but he could hear the sound of the water gushing, the nozzle swashing as it slipped against the horrid swarms of gut-like appendages. 

The Fleshroot pounced in challenge, ensnaring Lunch in a web of itself. It tied and bound him, a bloody fire-singed red slipped circles on him. His grip slacked and the hose tumbled out Lunch’s hands. It suspended him in the air, stringing him high. In ferocious anger it plowed forward and blindly slammed Lunch down atop the washing machine. A denting bang sounded as Lunch’s tank crushed the top loader door. Papp heard him groan. The sound was followed by a low hollow pop. In a cacophony of deafening cracks and booms, the floor splintered and caved. Lunch, the writhing monster and the washing machine dropped.

Papp staggered up, his friend gone. The firehose laid streaming at his feet. He moved to the torn opening in the hall closet and peered down. There was a shrouding stir of varicolored dust. The 

Chief hollered, “Report!”

Rhodes was quick on the radio, “Chief, Papp is moving. I can't see Lunch from the window.”

Papp responded, “Joists gave! Lunch is on the ground floor.”

The Chief replied sharply, “Copy. Going in. Rhodes, escort EMS and bring a board.”

The wind was ruffling Rhodes mic as he hurried down the ladder, “Copy.”",2,1770329054.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

The first three were magical—cinemas, theatres, cafes, travels. But then everything changed.

They became homebodies. Linda worked as a freelancer, rarely leaving the house. Noah worked in an office.

Every time Linda suggested going out, Noah said, “I’m tired. Maybe next time.”

The pattern repeated for years.

Their conversations shortened from passionate debates to “Hi, what’s up?” “Nothing special.”

They still lived together. Still loved each other—or thought they did. They’d become used to each other. Overcome hardships together—financial struggles, health issues.

Those memories were the binding blocks of their current life.

One morning, Noah left for work. Linda made coffee, sat at her computer to start an architectural project.

Instead, she registered on a dating app.

She was bored. Needed someone to talk to.

She uploaded a photo where only her hair and eyes were visible.

A guy named Alex messaged her. Handsome. Young.

They talked about books, writers, movies. They loved the same genres.

The conversation deepened. Linda confessed she felt lonely, bored, trapped in a comfort zone that was slowly killing her.

Alex shared the same feelings. He confessed he was married but tired of his wife, thinking of divorce. Linda’s remarks about comfort zones in marriage made him reevaluate everything.

They talked daily for a month. Every morning after Noah left for work, Linda would message Alex.

Every evening she tried talking to Noah. His answers were shallow, unwilling. She compared them to Alex’s thoughtful responses.

Finally, Linda agreed to meet Alex. Out of curiosity. She believed he was her soulmate. She felt guilty he was married. Sometimes thought about divorce herself. But told herself she just needed someone to talk to.

Linda dressed up for the first time in years. Applied makeup.

“Where are you going?” Noah asked, scrolling his phone.

“Meeting an old friend.”

Noah just nodded.

Linda sat at a restaurant by the window, nervous, excited, checking every young man who passed.

A man entered with a bouquet. Her heart raced—but he approached another woman, kissed her.

Linda felt disappointed.

It was AI,"A recent marketing campaign for a coffee shop in San Jose cleverly utilized AI to simulate a celebrity appearance. The cafe aimed to attract attention and foot traffic by generating buzz around a supposed sighting of popular artist Bad Bunny. This innovative strategy highlights the increasing importance of creative marketing within the competitive Bay Area business landscape, where unique experiences can significantly influence customer engagement and sales.

The use of AI in this context reflects a broader trend among local businesses to leverage technology for enhanced promotional efforts, ultimately contributing to economic development in the region. By drawing in crowds through buzzworthy events and appearances, businesses can strengthen their foothold in the market, attracting both locals and tourists. 

As businesses explore inventive ways to distinguish themselves, the implications for real estate are notable. A successful marketing campaign can lead to increased foot traffic, potentially driving demand for commercial spaces nearby. This trend underscores the evolving intersection of technology and consumer behavior in the Bay Area, where innovative marketing strategies could reshape local commercial real estate dynamics.

1qwz370,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConnectBetter/comments/1qwz370/10_habits_that_will_make_you_live_longer_the/,10 Habits That Will Make You Live Longer: The Science Behind Blue Zones,"You ever notice how some people just radiate health? They're 60 but look 45, got energy for days, and aren't popping pills like Tic Tacs. Meanwhile, the rest of us are dragging ass by 2pm, living on coffee and existential dread.

Here's what I figured out after diving deep into longevity research, blue zone studies, and podcasts with actual scientists (not Instagram wellness gurus): Most of us are doing health completely wrong. We think it's about gym memberships we never use or kale smoothies that taste like lawn clippings. Nope. The people who live longest do completely different shit, and it's way simpler than you think.

I spent months researching this, reading everything from [**The Blue Zones**](https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Zones-Lessons-Living-Longest/dp/1426207557) studies to listening to Peter Attia's deep dives on longevity. What I found wasn't some magic pill or biohacking nonsense. It was boring, unsexy habits that compound over decades. But they work.

# 1. They Move Constantly (Not ""Exercise"")

Forget the gym for a second. The longest living people on Earth don't do CrossFit or run marathons. They just move. All. Day. Long.

In blue zones (places where people regularly live past 100), they're gardening, walking to the market, doing yard work. They've got what scientists call ""natural movement"" built into their environment. Their bodies never get a chance to completely shut down.

**The science**: Sitting for extended periods literally shortens your lifespan. A study in the **British Journal of Sports Medicine** found that reducing sitting time to less than 3 hours a day could add 2 years to your life expectancy.

**What to do**: Set a timer every 45 minutes. Get up. Walk around. Do some squats. Stretch. Make movement unavoidable in your life. Park farther away. Take stairs. Walk while talking on the phone. Your body was designed to move constantly, not sit in a chair for 12 hours.

# 2. They Don't Eat Until They're Stuffed

In Okinawa, Japan (where people live the longest), they have this concept called **hara hachi bu**, which means ""eat until you're 80% full."" They literally stop eating before they're stuffed.

Western culture? We eat until our pants don't button and then blame the restaurant for large portions.

**The science**: Caloric restriction (eating less without malnutrition) is one of the most proven ways to extend lifespan across species. Research published in **Cell Metabolism** shows that reducing calorie intake by 15% can slow aging and reduce disease risk.

**What to do**: Eat slowly. Put your fork down between bites. Stop when you feel satisfied, not when you need to unbutton your pants. Your stomach takes 20 minutes to signal your brain that it's full. Most people finish their meal in 10 minutes and wonder why they feel like garbage.

# 3. They Have a Tribe (Actual Human Connection)

Loneliness kills. Literally. The longest living people have deep social connections. They eat meals with family. They have friends they see regularly. They're part of communities.

**The science**: A Harvard study that tracked people for 80+ years found that close relationships are the number one predictor of happiness and longevity. Social isolation increases mortality risk by 29%, similar to smoking 15 cigarettes a day.

**What to do**: Schedule regular hangouts like they're doctor appointments. Join a club. Volunteer. Go to that thing you keep canceling. Call your friends instead of just texting. Face to face interaction releases oxytocin, which reduces stress and inflammation.

**Resource check**: If you're struggling with social anxiety or building connections, the app **Ash** has some solid relationship coaching features. It's basically therapy in your pocket for navigating social dynamics without the cringe.

# 4. They Prioritize Sleep Like Their Life Depends On It (Because It Does)

Healthy people treat sleep like a sacred ritual. They're not grinding until 2am and bragging about it. They're in bed at reasonable hours because they understand that sleep is when your body repairs itself.

**The science**: Chronic sleep deprivation increases risk of heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and dementia. A study in **Nature Communications** found that sleeping less than 6 hours a night is associated with a 13% increased mortality risk.

**What to do**: Aim for 7 to 9 hours. Make your bedroom a cave (dark, cool, quiet). No screens an hour before bed. Create a wind down routine. Your brain needs to know it's time to shut down.

**Book rec**: [**Why We Sleep**](https://www.amazon.com/Why-We-Sleep-Unlocking-Dreams/dp/1501144316) by Matthew Walker is absolutely mind-blowing. Walker is a sleep scientist at UC Berkeley, and this book will make you question everything you think you know about sleep. It's basically a horror story about what happens when you don't sleep enough. After reading it, you'll treat sleep like the non-negotiable health pillar it actually is.

# 5. They Don't Stress Eat Their Feelings

Healthy people feel stress (they're not robots), but they don't use food as their primary coping mechanism. They've got other tools in their toolkit.

**The science**: Chronic stress triggers cortisol release, which promotes fat storage (especially around your midsection), disrupts sleep, and tanks your immune system. A study in **Psychosomatic Medicine** found that chronic stress accelerates cellular aging.

**What to do**: Find non-food stress relievers. Go for a walk. Journal. Do breathwork (box breathing is stupid simple and works). Talk to someone. Stress is inevitable, but how you respond to it determines everything.

**App rec**: **Finch** is a habit building app that uses a cute little bird to help you track self care activities. Sounds gimmicky but it's weirdly effective for building stress management routines. Way more engaging than just checking boxes on a habit tracker.

The app also has a virtual coach you can chat with about your struggles, and it keeps evolving the plan as you progress.

# 6. They Eat Real Food (Not Food Products)

The healthiest people eat food that comes from the ground or had a mother. Not stuff that comes in a box with 47 ingredients you can't pronounce.

In blue zones, their diets are mostly plant based with some meat occasionally. Lots of beans, vegetables, whole grains, nuts. Simple shit.

**The science**: Ultra processed foods are linked to literally every chronic disease. A study in **BMJ** found that for every 10% increase in ultra processed food consumption, there's a 14% higher risk of early death.

**What to do**: Shop the perimeter of the grocery store. If your grandma wouldn't recognize it as food, skip it. Aim for mostly plants, some lean protein, healthy fats. Don't overthink it.

# 7. They Have Purpose (A Reason to Get Up)

In Okinawa, it's called **ikigai** (reason for being). In Costa Rica's Nicoya Peninsula, it's **plan de vida** (life plan). Healthy people who live longest have a sense of purpose that gets them out of bed.

**The science**: Research published in **JAMA Psychiatry** found that people with a strong sense of purpose had a 15% lower risk of death. Purpose reduces stress, improves sleep, and keeps your brain sharp.

**What to do**: Find something that matters to you beyond just existing. Volunteer. Mentor someone. Create something. Work toward a goal that isn't about you. Purpose doesn't have to be saving the world. It just has to give your life meaning.

# 8. They Drink Water Like It's Their Job

Healthy people are constantly sipping water. They're not waiting until they're dying of thirst or drinking only coffee and energy drinks.

**The science**: Even mild dehydration impairs cognitive function, mood, and physical performance. Your body is 60% water. Every cell needs it to function.

**What to do**: Carry a water bottle everywhere. Drink a glass when you wake up. Aim for half your body weight in ounces daily. If your pee is dark yellow, you're dehydrated.

# 9. They Lift Heavy Stuff

Muscle mass is one of the biggest predictors of longevity. Healthy people don't just do cardio. They build and maintain muscle because it keeps you metabolically healthy and protects you as you age.

**The science**: Low muscle mass is associated with higher mortality rates. A study in **The Lancet** found that grip strength alone is a better predictor of death than blood pressure.

**What to do**: Lift weights at least twice a week. It doesn't have to be fancy. Bodyweight exercises work. Resistance bands work. Just challenge your muscles progressively.

**Book rec**: **Outlive** by Peter Attia is the ultimate longevity playbook. Attia is a physician obsessed with healthspan (living well, not just long). This book breaks down the science of exercise, nutrition, sleep, and emotional health in a way that's actually actionable. It's dense but worth every page. Best longevity book I've ever read.

# 10. They Don't Do Extreme Anything

Here's the kicker: Healthy people aren't extremists. They're not doing 30 day juice cleanses or working out 3 hours a day. They're consistent with moderate habits over decades.

**The science**: Consistency beats intensity every time. A study in **JAMA Internal Medicine** found that people who maintain moderate physical activity throughout life live longer than those who go hard for short periods then quit.

**What to do**: Stop looking for the perfect diet or perfect workout. Find something you can sustain for years. Small daily actions compound into massive results over time.

Living longer isn't about finding some secret hack. It's about doing boring, simple shit consistently. Move your body. Eat real food. Sleep enough. Connect with people. Find purpose. The people who live longest aren't special. They just don't sabotage themselves with the garbage habits the rest of us think are normal.

Now the anonymous users are meeting for the first time. Using the username they have put on their name tag and their description to come up with their true identities. You can also name those that tagged along to the event for an added challenge.*

* **MichaelBayLover001:** The first thing people notice about this woman is her Dolly Parton-like personality. But, the second thing is definitely her large brassiere. This flirtatious and bubbly blonde mother of three joined the site as a way to cope with her divorce from her longtime partner.
* **TCAirs:** Rocking a high top fade and in his crispy Air Jordans, this guy stands out in his matching red Nike jumpsuit. The fact that he also stands 6'4 also makes him stick out like a sore thumb. When people get to know him though, they find out that he is a shy love poet who does not really follow sports like his two older brothers.
* **Paper5Bitter:** This teenager in all black with a beanie on comes off to most as dark and moody. However, her friends on the site all know her as the silly sixteen year old who likes to write fantasy stories with funny, satirical twists to them. She came with her older sister, who doesn't write but supports her little sister in all her endeavours.
* **Terrible2Squared:** Now if you want to see someone moody, this morose writer might be right up your alley. The unshaven father of four (two pairs of twins! >\_<) is currently getting a coffee stain off his flannel shirt on the outside but he is thinking of more people for his John Wick-esque character to kill off.
* **SibonsiweOrchi:** This South African flew all the way to Asheville from Johannesburg to participate in the convention. She named her account, SibonsiweOrchi, after her daughter,   Sibonsiwe Orchid. She writes kids stories for Sibonsiwe and her little sister, Thandiwe Iris, and posts them on Composition Connection.
* **CruzFamiliaForever:** This little account is one of the stranger ones. It starts with a mother and her four kids homeschooling and ends with her and her husband introducing all of their kids to those who have been enjoying their works. For twenty minutes a day, each child freewrites whatever is in their mind and posts it to the site. They usually get very nice comments on their short stories and poems.
* **VillanousVal:** This teenager has been working very closely with the developers to get a comic section up so he can start posting his own comic books that he writes. In the meantime, he and his girlfriend are enjoying being in Asheville and are talking about perhaps going to college together there.
* **FviverJream:** Barely making the cut to be on the site without a parent, this thirteen year old writes romance stories anonymously so his friends won't laugh at him. It was only after coming out online as a thirteen year old straight boy who loves romance that he realized that he should have friends that don't laugh at his interests and encourage him. He is especially excited to meet TCAirs, who writes his favourite poetry.
* **TravellingYuppies:** Winning for driving the furthest, this bickering couple are nothing like the lifestyle advice writers they are on the site. Perhaps its because they were just cramped in their minivan for over two days with their small child in tow. Well, at least if they don't divorce on the way back to their home state, they'll have many stories to post for the amusement of those who couldn't come.
* **Yoni:** The head of the operation, she has been writing since she was around eleven. Now nearing her fiftieth birthday, she has made something she can be proud of that will last a long time, a community of people who enjoy writing coming together every year to share stories and reconnect.

1qwyrfa,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1qwyrfa/my_exboyfriend_42m_has_chronic_kidney_disease_he/,My ex-boyfriend (42M) has chronic kidney disease. He hid this from me and I think he's hiding his disease from his family.,"I (41F) dated my ex-boyfriend (42M) for a year and we were long distance. Very early on he mentioned that chronic kidney disease runs in his family. He explained that his father passed away due to the disease (his father didn't live to age 40). He also mentioned two of his siblings have chronic kidney disease (CKD) and one of them had a transplant a few years ago but was now rejecting the kidney.

He told me he felt lucky that he didn't have the disease and he's been working hard to prevent it - He is pescatarian, has a low protein diet, fasts every day and does lots of biohacking things to stay healthy and live long.

I asked him if there was a genetic test or name for this illness. He said no. (I later found out that he lied about this). Anyway, at the time he said that his doctors do regular checks on his kidneys and he's fine.

We dated long distance for about a year and in that time, I completely fell in love with him. We were travelling a lot between the UK and USA. He didn't introduce me to his family or to any friends. He said he didn't have many friends because he had moved a lot and he said that his mother and siblings didn't get along with each other and that's why he keeps a distance. All of this seemed believable at the time and I was happy to just get to know him. It was as if we were in our own world - just the two of us and this was fine for some time.

During the relationship, there were highs and lows. The lows were usually to do with his mood. He would become argumentative, controlling and have random outbursts of anger. I would often stay silent during his outbursts because I have had a lot of trauma in my past. This would then cause him to spiral with further outbursts. He would eventually apologise but towards the end, it was clear that the relationship was not healthy.

We used to talk about marriage a lot. The plan was that we would get married and I would get a greencard and move to the USA. The reality is that the process would take a few years because I have various commitments in the UK, but he said that he didn't mind. Sometimes he would get paranoid and say things that showed that he was concerned that perhaps I would marry him and then divorce him.

I guess its worth mentioning that we're both divorced so I could understand some of his fears around remarrying, building a life together and then getting divorced again. Having said that, over time - his paranoia got worse. And I felt like he was constantly trying to get me to prove to him that I am genuinely in love with him and I will definitely not leave him! In the end, I got fed up of his controlling behaviour and I didn't feel that it was healthy for us to remain together so I ended things.

But here's the thing - Now that it's over I've been doing a lot of thinking and reflecting on some of the challenges in the relationship and I was trying to connect the dots especially with his bizarre health routine.

While I dated him - I hardly ever saw him drink water and I was wondering why this would be the case. For someone who was a biohacker and obsessed with his health and longevity, my ex would work out three times a week but he would never drink water, never eat fruit and he basically ate the same 3 meals everyday (this strict diet is not too unusual for biohackers) but I was wondering why he doesn't drink water especially since you need water for muscle growth.

Because we spent a lot of time together, I knew the timing of his drinks and this man only ever drank herbal tea, lungo coffee, sprite and ginger ale.

So yesterday I started to wonder **'Why is it a man in his 40s who has a history of chronic kidney disease in the family, refuses to drink water? Surely he should be strict and ensure he has at least 6-8 glasses per day?'**

And then I googled and did some digging and it turns out that when kidney disease reaches stage 4 or 5, many times the doctors tell the patients to limit their liquid intake so that no further kidney damage happens. Stage 4-5 Chronic Kidney disease is the most severe on the scale. It effectively means that you are definitely on your way to dialysis and you will eventually need a transplant.

I found that in addition to limiting the liquid intake, patients in stage 4-5 are advised to try to maintain their calories because they are likely to lose weight and muscle mass and this is why their doctors recommend they drinks clear soft drinks particularly sprite and ginger ale! And the reason why lungo coffee is a good version of coffee is because you can maintain the strength of coffee without dealing with the high liquid intake.

And once, I read this - other things started to make sense.

He used to go to bed really early. He'd typically be asleep by 7pm every night and his kids go to sleep at 9pm, which made no sense why he is asleep before his kids. He had light sensitivity, depigmentation of his beard and he seemed to be managing a lot of stress. He said the stress was from his divorce but now I see that the stress was from managing the kidney disease.

Another thing that now makes sense is the painkillers.

He was extremely careful with painkillers - so much that he'd cut a tablet into half if he ever needed one and he'd keep a record of the time of his intake.

He claimed that his mother who is a nurse taught him that this is important ie not taking a full dosage- maybe this is true. But to be so specific with recording your dosage of half of a painkiller is insane to me!

Anyway, there was a period of time where for about 1 week, he started to stock up on painkillers (at the time he claimed they were for his mother). Every time we would head out, he would stop at a pharmacy and he would purchase 2 or more of the same painkillers - sometimes going back to the same shop on the same day but at a different time. He purchased enough painkillers to last 3 years and he bought this all in 1 week!

I've now found out that these particular painkillers are forbidden for patients with kidney disease. However, some patients will take this to manage their pain especially if they have refused to slow down their lifestyle. The painkiller helps with their pain but it also damages their kidney!

Now I realise that the reason he probably didn't want me to meet his family or friends is because he was trying to maintain an image with me. It's possible that they know about the disease and they would warn me that this man is a ticking time bomb and he only wants you to move to the USA and marry him so that you can become his full time nurse!

The saddest part is that for someone with kidney disease, he's one of the busiest people I know. His work is extremely demanding, he's very ambitious and I can understand why he didn't want to slow down but I also started to see that its very possible that he's intentionally damaging his kidneys so he can speed up his journey to getting a transplant. Perhaps he wants to get the transplant now in his 40s rather than when he's in his 50s where his body will be older and not able to cope. Its not clear his reason.

All I know is that he was hiding a serious disease from me. He didn't want me to know how extreme it was and he certainly didn't want me to know that he's reliant on painkillers.

I'm still trying to make sense of the loss of a man. By the end of our relationship, he had cut off contact from his entire family and he had no friends. I'm not sure if his family knew that his disease had progressed this far. It's most likely that he was keeping this a secret from them.

I also now feel very sad about the time we spent together. He was travelling back and forth from the UK to the USA, probably living in extreme agony faking a lifestyle that was costing him his health.

I am also sad that he lied to me and he didn't feel that he could be honest. Now I understand why he was always so angry and argumentative - possibly some of his behaviour is down to his personality but I believe that his anger and frustration was definitely made worse by the kidney disease. Living a busy lifestyle, constantly having to manage your pain, taking drugs to keep up with his busy life, lying to his family and friends, lying to me - All of this was effectively making his health worse.

From what I experienced of him, I believe that he carried a lot of shame about being ill. He likes to be independent, smart and he wants to give the world the impression that he has 100% control of his life, so I can imagine that the kidney disease wasn't just destroying him physically it was destroying him mentally and emotionally.

I believe his plan was to keep the disease a secret from me while I live in the UK and once I move permanently to the USA, and I am reliant on him for the green card and finances, he would suddenly reveal the illness and I would have turned into his full time nurse and caretaker.

Having said all of this, I'm glad that I ended things. I feel like if I had stayed with him, I would have eventually discovered the lies and the drugs and I'd have resented him for it. I'd probably have ended up spending the next 10-20 years trying to support his health and I think his attitude towards me would have gotten worse.

I have some days when I feel so sad. I find myself mourning the loss of our relationship, what we could have had but I also feel so sad that he's dealing with this disease all by himself. He doesn't even know that I now know that the disease has progressed.

I left him because of the way in which he treated me but I think that part of the reason he treated me so badly was because he felt consumed by all the secrets and lies from the disease. I feel like I've just said goodbye to an addict - It's as if he was addicted to the lies and addicted to the painkillers.

I wish things were different for him and he wasn't dealing with such a painful illness. I sometimes worry about who will look after him when things get worse. I just hope he tells his family so that they can support him when he needs it.

Tldr: My ex boyfriend was trying to get me to leave the UK and move over to live with him in the USA. I ended the relationship because he was quite controlling in his behaviour towards me. Now that is over and I've researched some of his health hacks, it turns out he very likely has state 4-5 chronic kidney disease and possibly a drug addiction and he was hiding it from everyone, including his family and including me.",3,1770328083.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False

Jim Muth's commentary for the image:
> FOTD -- February 06, 2011 (Rating 7)
> 
> Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
> 
> Today's image is a slightly deep scene in the East Valley of a 
> minor minibrot lying in one of the side star-arms of a small 
> period-16 bud on the northwest shore line of the main bay of the 
> Mandelbrot set.
> 
> Words fail to describe the fractal, which can be truly enjoyed 
> only by the sense of vision.  The colors were intensified in a

> colors were recorded in the included parameter file. It works 
> just fine.
> 
> The result rated a 7.  If I had been in a more pleasant mood, I 
> might have rated the image an 8.  The name ""Extemporaneously-1"" 
> is a spur-of-the-moment thing, with no deep hidden meaning.
> 
> Unfortunately, the image lies deep enough to make arbitrary-
> precision math necessary, which increases the calculation time 
> to a rather dragging 17-plus minutes.
> 
> Sleet and freezing rain with a temperature of 30F -1C made Saturday

How do I talk to him about this?","I'm 26F, two months pregnant, married to 31M. In January, I found out he'd been texting a younger woman he used to work with. I knew they were in contact, but then he lied to me to meet her for coffee and spent 3 hours with her. I found out immediately when he got home. He'd never lied to me like that before—looked me in the eyes, smiled, and lied.

He said he lied to ""protect my feelings"" because he knew I wouldn't want him spending time with her. A couple months before, I'd told him directly that I was uncomfortable with her after she came to our house—there was just something between them I picked up on right away. But he kept texting her anyway.

The last few months have been hell. He insists it's just friendship, nothing more. Last week I wrote him a letter pouring my heart out about how I feel. He responded saying this friendship makes him a ""better person,"" that the music she shared ""opened a deep well of emotion,"" and he feels a connection with her he hasn't felt in years. They're having deep conversations about childhood trauma and similar issues.

He recently cut off contact because I was trying so hard to be okay with it that I basically had a breakdown. But he's extremely upset about losing this ""friendship"" and has been distant and quiet ever since. I'm pretty sure he thinks I'll change my mind, but I just can't be okay with this.

We both want to stay together, especially with the baby coming. But I don't see him making effort—he just seems sad about losing her.

I’m chubby, 5’9, over 200lbs, and I’m trying to make a difference in my life because my health is starting to decline before I’m even 25.

I work from home, an office job that requires 6 days out of the week. I sit around all day. When I get off work, I crawl upstairs and hop onto my pc and game. Doing simple things like bending over to tie my shoes or simply sweeping my living room makes me break a sweat… which is really starting to concern me.

I’ve cut down on smoking significantly, and it’s done a lot for me. I rarely ever drink alcohol, but I’m really bad at drinking water. So I’m working to improve on drinking more fluids throughout the day, even if it means flavoring my water with sugar free flavor packets to make it tolerable to me.

Recently I’ve cut out all junk food, I’m only eating slim meats like chicken and fish, the occasional steak, veggies, filler calories like brown rice or mashed potatoes. I eat twice a day, lunch and dinner, while I have only coffee for breakfast. I have small snacks like granola, beef jerky, tuna and crackers in between meals to hold me off if I’m having blood sugar problems.

I’ve also started walking/jogging for 30 minutes everyday on my lunch breaks. I walk for 20, and jog for 10. This is where I’m starting in terms of “working out” in my out-of-shape journey… and I’m looking for advice on if this is a good path to take, where to go from here, if this is a worthwhile option.

If you were in my shoes, what would you do? I think my next option is to add mild strength training to my walking/jogging time each day… but I’m not sure. Are there exercises you would recommend? Any at-home tricks? I have Autism and ADHD and I need something fun that will keep my attention, something I can stick with longterm, but won’t burn out my motivation after a few days.

I imagine you and I sitting down together at a coffee shop and you just asked me what I'm reading. I say ""A couple weeks ago I finished Psyche and Eros by Luna McNamara"". And then you say ""oh! How was that one?"" And then I say....  



So here's the thing book bestie, I try to keep my book babbling positive. For me, books are like people in so many ways. And just like with a person, if I don't like a book I'm just not going to talk about it rather than speak poorly of it. So the fact that I'm talking about this book means that I liked it. But I also have some thoughts about it. Mostly good thoughts, but maybe some critical thoughts as well. Though I kinda wonder if the critical thoughts say more about me than the book? 



You know I love my mythology and folktales. But for whatever reason Greek mythology just isn't favorite. I respect it, I admire it, I love listening to people talk about it. I love people who love Greek mythology. But it's never been my personal favorite. So I can't say how accurate this is to the original myth. But it feels like it is. 

And it breathes life into this story. It fills out the gaps it rounds out the edges it gives the names dimension and personalities. And if you are someone, like I was, who doesn't know much about Psyche and Eros, then I absolutely recommend this book. I feel like I'm familiar with their story now, and I feel like I know them. As more than just names, as personalities. And I loved that part. 



But... I wish I would have gotten more Psyche.  I found myself waiting for the parts of the story that were hers, and tuning out a bit during the parts of the story told by Eros. And also, and I feel really really bad saying this as someone who is very self conscious about their voice, I just didn't like the voice used for Eros. I kinda wish I would have read the physical book, I wonder how much that would have changed my reading experience.  ",3,1770327591.0,u_winteregress,0,1.0,False

They can never give a valid answer and the only thing they can do is twist my words and accuse me of saying you should drink energy drinks instead of vitamins. Honestly this is such a big pet peeve of mind this rant might have required a throwaway account.

I'm not saying the healthier alternative isn't to go caffeine free or that zero sugar monster energy drinks are good for you but this idea that the added vitamins in a monster come from a different vitamin factory than where you get your one-a-days from is absurd. Yet no one ever says vitamins are bad for you. What bad stuff is in there, caffeine? Even if you don't drink coffee yourself, outside of the occasional health nut, no one goes around telling coffee drinkers that coffee is bad for you. Mind your own business. We all know it's better to drink it in moderation. L-taurine? I still can't believe that dumb rumor that everyone ELSE believed back in the day that it was made from bull testicles. Some of the stuff they put in monsters I've literally gone out of my way to buy as a health supplement and even if the quality can differ between supplement brands no one would go so far as to say the inferior brands are bad for you. Artificial sweeteners? You mean the ones they put in literally every other diet soda, protein bar/shake, low carb alternative that tons of health conscious people go out of their way for on a regular basis? Aspartame? Doesn't have it.

It seems similar to the situation with the new charged lemonade scandal at Panera. Very early on in the energy drink days, people with heart conditions started drinking high caffeine beverages in large amounts like they would with soda or lemonade, which they drank like water, and gave themselves heart attacks. Of course it made big news because both lawyers and journalists have to make their money. It's been about 15-20 years already since energy drinks became popular. Let the stigma die already.

My eating is rather consistent - same breakfast everyday, no lunch, homemade dinner - I’m entering my meals with as much detail as possible down to the amount of butter I put on my toast and creamer I put in my coffee. I’ve entered the nutritional info manually from the exact food products I use, I’m doing everything I can to be 100% accurate with my entries. When I follow an online recipe, I use the nutritional facts from the website to create a new food item in my app. 

So please tell me how, even after entering what is one of the heaviest dinners I’d eat, I am still in a calorie deficit. I don’t understand how I’ve racked my weight up to 200 while eating in deficit. I don’t consider myself someone who under eats, though admittedly I do sometimes (up to 1 week per month) skip breakfast as well opting just for coffee but even then my dinners (I thought) made up for it. 

I set my weight loss goal relatively intense (2lbs/week) so my calorie goal is around 1500, though I believe  1800-2100 cal daily should be my maintenance amount and I can only imagine I’ve been eating under that for years. And before anyone says it - I rarely keep snacks in the house, some days I’ll be tempted by a sweet treat but nothing crazy and if I’m in a deficit most other days of the week it shouldn’t matter in the end, right?

I’m just confused, are there more factors than just calorie count? Is there a blind spot in my tracking? All I can think of is that my fiber intake could be better, but could it rly just be that? Also I’m going to the gym later so I’ll manage to stay around my goal atm. 

I’m 5’ 10” F 25yo - if it helps

Breakfast cal: 674

Dinner cal: 1,000

Missing. It was the first word I read every day walking into work. Some quiet mornings as I drove into the park, I wouldn’t see anyone else on the way out to the ranger station, so hers was the first face I saw too. 

The poster had made my skin crawl when they hung it up. Something about the large red letters and the picture of the smiling young woman seemed incongruent. She hadn’t intended for that picture of her to be on a poster, shared for everyone passing through the park to see. Her eyes that stared at me from the bulletin board outside of the station held so much hope for the future, so much certainty that she would see tomorrow. Every morning as my eyes met hers, I was faced with the terrible reality to the contrary.

We had done everything we could for her. The search had been long and arduous, fighting the heat and the terrain as we struggled for her life when she couldn’t. Her family had thanked us, the media had called us heroes, but that poster still hung there. 

Patrice, that was her name. I often found that it was easier to separate that picture of her from the name, one without the other made it easier to forget the sinking feeling putting them together caused. I had called that name again and again as I walked my assigned trails, looking for tracks, blood, anything that could point us to her. Hundreds of people had done the same thing over the course of that month, and still nothing. 

She had been camping with her family in the park, the Coconino National Forest, my park. If her days there were anything like mine growing up, they had been filled with hikes and sweat and sunburns and wonder. Every new bend in the trail held the promise of unlocking some new secret, a vista that made you feel like you were the first one to ever see it. It had felt like magic back then, it still did now, except for every morning when I saw Patrice’s face again. 

I could still hear the Head Ranger’s stern voice going over the missing person questionnaire that her mother had filled out. I could pinpoint her last known location on any trail map. She had rushed ahead of her parents on the way back from a hike, eager to reach the trailhead and get back to cell service. She had been out of their sight for a quarter mile. No more than 10 minutes. 

I would admit, some trails in the park were harder to see than others. Whether from neglectful rangers not marking the path properly or game trails leading away from marked paths, sometimes visitors would get lost. But these things simply didn’t apply. She was near a trailhead, a stone’s throw away from a parking lot. Her parents realized she was missing within 5 minutes and had contacted the ranger station in 30. 

By now people had started talking. Not in the park thankfully, tourists didn’t know the situation and rangers generally found it in poor taste to speculate, but in town. Local newspapers and tabloids ran stories about the poor girl every week. “NEW SIGHTING IN MISSING GIRL CASE LEADS TO BOMBSHELL DISCOVERY,” was the headline today, wherein the reporter interviewed a man who had clearly never set foot in the park about what he had seen that day “A creature 10 feet tall and covered in purple and black fur.” I had caved and bought  copy to skim through it, as much as it sickened me to do so.

I couldn’t truly bring myself to blame people for their theories, as ridiculous as they may be. I was a ranger and I knew better, but I was also in some small part still the child reading stories of ghosts and ghoulies in the Superstition Mountains. Whatever happened to Patrice was completely explainable, there was a logical step by step process of how that young lady had ended up smiling eternally from a slip of paper in front of our station, but I’d be damned if I could see it. 

Doubt is the death of reason, my father had taught me that, when one too many ghost stories kept me up and sent me scuttling down the hallway to my parents room one too many nights. He talked to me like one of his students, even when I was that young, he told me “There’s nothing in this world that can’t be understood son. Your friends, strangers, people you don’t like, and even things that don’t exist, like the monsters in your head. Everything is for a reason.”

This morning as I drove into work, I could feel very little reason left in me. Three months on from the disappearance and still it clung to me like ash. But it wasn’t just me. Over the weeks since Patrice disappeared a wordless assumption had spread through the rangers. A sort of unspoken recognition, like seeing a storm cloud and knowing to head back off the trails. Something terrible had happened to that girl. 

I pulled my dusty beat up pickup into the parking lot and hurried inside the ranger station, holding my hat down against the wind. Trying my best to hurry past our bulletin board as the posters flapped in the gale. I had been lucky to make it indoors before the storm started, although I didn’t think I’d be staying dry long. My boots made soft thuds against the carpet of the small, squat building. 

The Mogollon Rim station wasn’t as big or modern as others in the park, and it was an hour drive to the Coconino Visitors Center, but it had been there since I was a boy. When I had imagined growing up to be a ranger, without knowing any better, I had always imagined living there. 

Jordan was already there, sitting hunched over a bowl of oatmeal in the kitchen, favoring the sound of my boots with a smile before returning to his breakfast. He was a big guy in every sense of the word; his frame, his beard, his voice, his personality. He had passed hands between parks for most of his life, from Mammoth to Zion, never staying longer than a few seasons. 

“The weather is looking nice today,” I said with faux sincerity, gesturing at the trees shadow boxing the air outside the kitchen window. 

“Yeah, nice for a mudslide maybe,” Jordan replied, glancing at the darkening sky, “I hope all the campers went home yesterday.” 

We both knew that wouldn’t be the case. Campers were a tenacious lot, whether by bravery, stupidity, or non-refundable rentals, most would stay out long past when comfort was a distant memory. We would groan and pretend to be annoyed, but really most of the rangers were happy to help people in the parks, even when the mess they were in was one they made, and Jordan and I were no exception. 

“Who’s our third today?” Jordan asked, sitting his bowl in the sink. 

“Elizabeth I think,” 

Jordan scowled at that, a face I knew he would make. Elizabeth was by most accounts, an intelligent and hardworking ranger. She had a true passion for the outdoors and conservation, she was the model of what the forestry service wanted their rangers to look like, and that’s exactly what earned her the look on Jordan’s face. 

“You know if you just talked to her she really is an interesting person, man,” I said.

“Talk to her? I’ve never seen anyone talk TO her, Miss Motormouth only talks AT people on and on about all the work she’s been doing and how much she helps blah blah blah,” Jordan said, moving his hand like a puppet’s mouth. 

“She’s going to walk through this door and kick your ass one of these days,” I said, chuckling a bit. 

Elizabeth and I shared our zeal for the park, and for that reason I couldn’t bring myself to share Jordan’s opinion, even though she did admittedly have too much energy when she ran through the door a few minutes later, mousy brown hair damp from the start of the storm. 

“Sorry I’m late to our three stooges routine, I had to help a family of four find their way to a trail,” she said, cleaning flecks of rain off her wire rimmed glasses. Jordan looked at me and rolled his eyes, I just shook my head back at him. 

“To a trail? In this? Which one?” I said incredulously. 

“Horton Creek,” she said before taking a sip of her coffee and sitting her mug down.

“Horton Creek?!?” I said, my eyebrows raising at the thought, “They’re wanting to hike nine miles uphill now?”

“I know I know,” she said, throwing her hands up, “I asked them twenty times if they knew where they were going and how long the hike was, they were where they wanted to be.”

“I’d be hoping to avoid a criminal negligence charge if I were you,” Jordan said, “What in the world were they wanting to do out there?” 

“They kept mentioning wanting to find petroglyphs, and no matter how many times I told them they’re in a different part of the park, they wouldn’t listen,” Elizabeth said. 

Jordan and I looked at her dumbfounded for a few moments. There were many petroglyphs in Coconino, ancient illustrations of animals and symbols that Native Americans left on red rock faces all across the southwest, but they were on the north end of the park. Coming to the Mogollon Rim to look for them, in a thunderstorm, with your entire family, was nothing short of utterly bewildering.

“I’ll get the SAR kit ready,” I said, walking out of the kitchen and heading to the supply closet. They both laughed as I left, assuming I was joking along with them, but I was serious. These people were obviously lost or confused or just plain stupid, all of which mixed poorly with thunderstorms and the wilderness. I wasn’t interested in having 4 new posters outside our door. 

The shift passed quickly, the three of us staying inside as much as possible, taking turns rolling through the campgrounds in the ranger truck, helping anyone who needed it. The storm continued to rage as the day wore on, lightning tearing the sky open every other minute. Before we knew it, it was 5:30 and the sky was dark and the shift was drawing to its end. 

“Well our Horton morons seem to have survived,” Jordan said, shaking the rain off of his coat as he walked in from his last patrol. Elizabeth and I looked up at him from our card game as he walked over, “the car was gone and I didn’t see any bodies.” 

The news brought a sigh of relief to the two of us, we had just been discussing minutes before which one of us would have to walk down the trail to check on them. That sinking feeling in my gut started to loosen for what felt like the first time in months, “I wonder if they found any petroglyphs?” We all began to chuckle at the thought, until our laughter was cut short by a distant ringing. 

It was the landline, tucked away in the head ranger’s office in the back of the building, a room we hadn’t even bothered to turn the lights on in. I stood up from my seat, “I’ll get it.”

I headed to the source of the noise and flipped on the lights, seeing the sparsely decorated office covered in a fine layer of dust. The head ranger rarely visited this side of the park, and used this phone even more rarely. Usually when it rang with no one here it was a telemarketer or someone trying different offices after missing him. I picked up the handset on the fourth ring, “Mogollon Rim ranger station, this is Mark.”

There was nothing but static on the other end, “Hello?” I said, seconds from hanging up. 

Then I heard a tone, a soft light sound like someone hitting a key on a toy piano. It played once, then went silent again. 

“H-,” I began to say again, before the tone played through once more. Static filled my ear followed by that tone every second or so. I couldn’t explain why, but the hairs on the back of my neck began to stand on end. I felt my breathing hastening. 

“Whatever calling list we’re on, can you please take this number off of it, this is a federal offi-.”

“Huuuu-,” a raspy, quiet voice whispered out. 

I found I could no longer breathe, the storm outside grew silent in my ears as I strained to listen. I heard the tone again, as more static played, getting louder as I jammed the handset against my ear. 

“Horrrr-ton…….\*tone\*….\*tone\*…..…..Crrree-eee-kkk….\*tone\*…..Paaaa-triiii-ceee……\*tone\*………\*tone\*….snap…\*tone\*……snAp….SNap…\*tone\*.”

The line went dead as I dropped the handheld out of my grasp, my knees suddenly made of jelly. I felt myself stumbling backwards as my shoulders crashed into a filing cabinet, shaking the walls of the station as I fell to the ground. I could hazily hear the sound of hurried footsteps running down the hallway to me, but my head was spinning too fast to pay them any mind. 

Patrice. The voice had said her name. It was worse than every horror story I ever read as a kid, it was a monster reaching through the phone and touching me with its incomprehensible language. Reality felt skewed, like what I had just experienced wasn’t part of the calculus of the universe. 

My gut felt what my head couldn’t articulate, whoever or whatever I had just spoken to wasn’t bluffing, and it wasn’t a prank. The evil of that voice still leaked out of the handheld like crude oil as it lay on the carpeted floor, I could feel it coating my ear. 

“Jesus fuck man what happened to you?” Jordan said, his figure a blurry shadow looming over my lowly state. 

“Pa…Patrice…,” I managed to croak out, vision beginning to sharpen. 

Both of them went white as a sheet at the mention of her name. Glancing at each other, they both bent down and helped stand me on my feet, Elizabeth supporting me. 

“Listen dude, if this is a fucking joke neither of us are laughing,” Elizabeth said, wrapping her arm around my back as Jordan grabbed my shoulders. 

“I’m…I’m not joking,” the haze in my head was starting to lift, replaced by the unending urge of adrenaline, “there was a voice on the phone, “Horton Creek, Patrice, snap snap snap”.""

Elizabeth and Jordan flinched like they had been shot, all color drained from their faces as they comprehended what I was saying. 

“Jordan, call the supervisor’s office and have them get the cops to the trailhead, I’ll take the truck and walk the trai-“

“NO!” I snapped, standing on my own strength as the adrenaline finally seemed to hit my legs, “None of us are leaving each other’s sight, not now. Jordan, use your cell to call the supervisor’s office on the way there, we go together.” It was very seldom important, but I was technically the senior ranger at the station, and my word was law until someone else came around. 

Without another word, we began to sprint to the parking lot. I grabbed the SAR kit as the other two threw on their raincoats and grabbed mine. We erupted out of the door in a maelstrom of wind and rain, the pitch black swirling around, seemingly threatening to collapse on top of us. We hopped 3 across in the front row of the ranger truck and floored it down the forest road to Horton Creek. After Jordan finished his call and closed his phone, not one of us spoke again, we could all feel it. A wordless assumption. An unspoken recognition. 

The trailhead’s sign was illuminated by the high beams of the truck within minutes, Elizabeth bringing the car to a halt in the barren parking lot. All 3 of us jumped out and immediately hit the trail, moving as swiftly as we could in the waving beams of our flashlights. Taking turns sweeping them through the forest, trying to make out anything in the bending branches. 

None of us bothered to call out Patrice’s name. We had no illusion of her being safe. If the call I had gotten was real, whoever that was on the other end of the receiver didn’t leave her alive, I was sure of it. We were here to try to find evidence before the rain washed it away. We were here to make sure the trail was safe for the police. We weren’t heroes or saviors, we were punctuation. There would be no happy ending tonight. My mind began to race with the possibilities as the hike wore on. 

A kidnapping had long been seen as the only feasible option by the police in Flagstaff, although they had pursued that line of inquiry quietly. The terrain and the time frame made the idea of an unintentional disappearance nearly impossible. Conversely, the fact that she was running to the trailhead to talk to her boyfriend, a boy she had never seen again, seemed to rule out anything intentional. 

Not that a kidnapping made much more sense, given the logistics of ferrying a fifteen year old girl out of a park with cameras at every road entrance and nothing but desert and pines for miles in every direction, but without a body it was the only option. 

I struggled to push the speculation from my mind and focus on the trail as the path heaved upwards, the steepening indicating we were nearing the end of our hike. The turn around point was four and a half miles from the parked ranger truck, where the police would be arriving any minute now to wait for our report on the trail. 

The storm began abating rapidly, seeming as if it was retreating in reverence as we rose higher on the trail, nearing the apex of our trek. The silence in the wake of the storm was nearly as deafening as the howling wind moments before, as the trail was now bathed in the void of sound. None of us spoke, we hadn’t since leaving the truck, the only noise in all the world was the muddy schlepping of our boots on the trail. 

I was the first to reach the top of the small plateau that contained Horton Springs within it. I could hear the creek rushing beneath my feet as I stood atop it. I swept the beam of my flashlight across the ground, scanning for something, anything. I flinched at every glinting pebble and puddle, certain that it was the light from those terrible eyes that peered at me from her posters. 

Elizabeth and Jordan drew up behind me and started scanning as well, all of us seemingly unwilling to walk any further than we needed. The silence became absolute as we stood there, barely daring to breathe. Off in the distance, I could swear I heard it…a faint tone.

Our beams all hit them at the same time. Going from carefully sweeping the plateau to being locked onto a single point.

At the edge of the plateau, protruding from the earth like a cruel thorn born of the wretched ambition of something indescribable, were her legs. Rended down to the bone, her left leg snapped entirely off at the shin, her right bearing the shoe she had been wearing on her last day, still dripping from the torrent it had just endured. 

I knew it was rain, but I could’ve sworn I saw black oil leaking down the ivory thorns. ",2,1770327168.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

I (21f) am starting out in my career, saving money, and still living at home, my mom has always been extremely overprotective and overbearing, she means well most of the time, but it can be a little ridiculous at times 

since i started driving and working as a teenager, anytime i go out alone or with friends through a drive thru for food or coffee or whatever, or go shopping, she watches my location and if she sees me at a restaurant or store and when i got home if i didnt get her anything or text her to ask if she wants anything she throws a FIT. she'll say ""well i guess you didnt get me anything again"" ""youre such a selfish only child"" and the craziest thing is is that if i do end up getting her something, which i do actually do a decent amount, she almost never pays me back! 

i really dont put up with her behavior anymore, i just ignore it, i definitely used to as a kid, but now i just don't let it bother me, but a small part of me is wondering if this is selfish of me? shes really not strict at all, shes always been okay with me getting tattoos, drinking and smoking weed responsibly, etc even as a teenager, shes more just about control than anything, ever since i started driving she obsessively watches where i am and makes a scene and cries when i tell her im going out with friends. i know a lot of you are gonna tell me to just turn off my location especially since im a grown woman with my own job and saving up my money and everything, but trust me, the tantrum she throws whenever ive done that makes it not even worth it ",2,1770327152.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False
1qwyb0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/focusedmen/comments/1qwyb0p/how_to_have_fun_without_drinking_sciencebased/,How to have fun without drinking: science-based strategies that actually work,"So here's the thing. I've been digging into this for months because I noticed something weird. A huge chunk of us genuinely don't know how to have fun sober anymore. We've been conditioned to believe that fun = alcohol. Every social script we've learned involves drinking. Birthday? Drinks. Friday night? Drinks. Bad day? Drinks. Good day? Also drinks.

I started researching this after realizing I'd convinced myself I was ""boring"" without alcohol. Turns out, that's complete BS. The science is wild, alcohol literally numbs your brain's reward system over time, making natural dopamine hits feel less exciting. No wonder sober fun feels flat at first. Your brain's been rewired.

The good news? You can absolutely retrain it. I've pulled together insights from neuroscience research, psychology podcasts, and people who've actually done this successfully. Here's what actually works.

\*\*The dopamine reset is real\*\*

Your brain needs time to recalibrate. Alcohol floods your system with artificial dopamine, so when you remove it, natural pleasures feel muted for a bit. This isn't permanent. Dr. Anna Lembke talks about this in \*[Dopamine Nation](https://www.amazon.com/Dopamine-Nation-Finding-Balance-Indulgence/dp/0593439356�)\* (she's Stanford's addiction medicine chief, the book's a bestseller for good reason). She explains how our brains adapt to constant stimulation and why boredom is actually productive.

The reset takes roughly 30 days. After that, regular activities start feeling genuinely enjoyable again. Your morning coffee tastes better. Music hits different. Conversations become more engaging. It's not magic, it's neuroplasticity.

\*\*Find your actual interests (not drinking with extra steps)\*\*

This sounds obvious but most of us have no idea what we actually enjoy. We've been doing ""bar + drinking"" or ""party + drinking"" for so long that we forgot to develop real hobbies.

Try stuff that's genuinely engaging, not just ""sober alternatives"" that feel like diet versions of drinking. Rock climbing, painting, cooking classes, learning an instrument. The key is finding something with a learning curve that keeps your brain occupied.

\*The Huberman Lab\* podcast has an amazing episode on dopamine and motivation. Dr. Andrew Huberman (Stanford neuroscientist) breaks down how novelty and challenge create natural dopamine hits that actually last, unlike alcohol's temporary spike and crash.

\*\*Rewrite your social scripts\*\*

Here's where it gets tricky. Most social situations are built around alcohol. You need new scripts.

Host game nights. Organize hiking trips. Start a book club (yes, really, hear me out). \*[How to Do the Work\* ](https://www.amazon.com/How-Do-Work-Recognize-Patterns/dp/0593236540)by Dr. Nicole LePera is insanely good for understanding why we rely on external substances for internal regulation. She's a holistic psychologist and this book basically rewires how you think about coping mechanisms. Made me realize I was using alcohol to avoid uncomfortable feelings in social settings.

The \*We Can Do Hard Things\* podcast with Glennon Doyle has killer episodes on sobriety and social anxiety. She talks about learning to sit with discomfort instead of numbing it, which sounds preachy but is actually super practical.

\*\*Use apps that make sobriety interesting\*\*

\*I Am Sober\* is genuinely great. It tracks your progress, connects you with others, and gamifies the whole thing. Seeing your streak build creates its own dopamine hit.

[BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) is an AI-powered learning app that turns this whole journey into something way more engaging. Instead of just tracking days, you can set a goal like ""learn to enjoy socializing without alcohol as someone with social anxiety"" and it creates a personalized audio learning plan pulling from books like \*Dopamine Nation\*, psychology research, and expert insights on addiction and behavior change. 

You control the depth, from quick 10-minute summaries during your commute to 40-minute deep dives when you want the full context. The voice options are surprisingly addictive, you can pick anything from a calm, therapeutic tone to something more energetic. Built by a team from Columbia and former Google AI experts, it basically replaces scrolling with actual learning. Makes the whole process feel less like deprivation and more like leveling up.

Also try \*Finch\*, it's technically a self care app but it's perfect for building new habits. You take care of a little bird while building routines that don't involve drinking. Sounds cheesy, works surprisingly well.

\*\*The morning factor\*\*

Nobody talks about this enough, but sober mornings are genuinely incredible. You wake up clear headed, no anxiety, no ""what did I say last night"" spiral. That alone becomes motivating.

\*Atomic Habits\* by James Clear (sold over 10 million copies, the guy knows behavior change) breaks down how tiny improvements compound. He explains identity based habits, basically you start seeing yourself as someone who doesn't drink rather than someone who's ""trying not to drink."" That shift is huge.

\*\*Get comfortable being uncomfortable\*\*

Real talk, the first few sober social events will feel awkward. You'll notice how repetitive drunk conversations are. You'll feel self conscious. That's normal.

The \*Rich Roll\* podcast has incredible interviews with people who've transformed their lives without alcohol. Rich is an ultra endurance athlete who got sober in his 40s. His conversations go deep into what life looks like on the other side.

\*\*Connect with actual humans\*\*

Find your people. Whether that's AA, SMART Recovery, or just friends who don't center everything around drinking. Community makes this exponentially easier.

\*Quit Like a Woman\* by Holly Whitaker challenges the traditional recovery narrative and offers a feminist perspective on sobriety. She talks about how alcohol is marketed to women as self care, which is absolutely wild when you think about it. The book's been called ""revolutionary"" by multiple publications and honestly, it kind of is.

1qwy8fc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CostaRicaTravel/comments/1qwy8fc/trip_review_a_week_in_manuel_antonio/,Trip Review: A week in Manuel Antonio,"My spouse and I wanted a quick, warm, low-key getaway from the east coast and settled on a week in Manuel Antonio. We stayed at the Tulemar Resort after seeing glowing recommendations online, and generally had a good stay, though not without a few hiccups (see below). We wanted to share some quick thoughts and suggestions with this group, after finding this sub to be super helpful in trip planning.

**Transportation**: We arranged for private transit to/from SJO through the resort. It was $200 USD/total each way, and was just me and my spouse. We were told it would take about 3-4 hours to get to our resort in Manuel Antonio, which never proved to be true. The way there, it took about 5.5 hours due to heavy traffic. This freaked us out enough about missing our flight that we left the resort an hour earlier than originally planned, and on the way back to SJO it only took 2.5 hours. In short: traffic makes a HUGE difference, make sure you have plenty of buffer.

**Lodging (Tulemar Resort)**: We booked here after seeing GLOWING reviews online. We paid about $450 USD/night for a small room with a kitchenette (roughly standard hotel room size). The ability to book all of our excursions through the resort was super convenient, we saw SO much wildlife just sitting on our balcony - toucans, monkeys, tons of other birds and creatures, it was amazing.

*However.* We were disappointed in the service we received. To make a very long story short, we didn’t have hot water for the first 2 days. We had to constantly bug our assigned concierge about it, who kept putting us off and telling us it would be fixed “soon.” We had workers in our room for long periods of time with no resolution. We asked about changing rooms, but were repeatedly ignored. At one point during this, our concierge took a day off (totally fine) but then his backup told us he couldn’t do anything about it until the old concierge was back (not fine). Stressed and exasperated, we escalated to management, who was super helpful - we were immediately upgraded to a way nicer villa for 2 days, and then to a comparable room for the remaining stay. We enjoyed the rest of our stay, but the whole ordeal was really stressful and we shouldn’t have had to escalate so much over hot water. Our concierge also told us we’d be compensated for the days without hot water, but nothing ever came of it. *Ultimately, the experience was off putting enough that we would probably look elsewhere for a future stay.* 

**Excursions:** We did a ton! In particular, we loved the sunset catamaran experience with Sunset Sails - wonderful crew, and we saw a ton of whales! We also really enjoyed the Sloth Walk through the resort with the Sloth Institute and ziplining through Sukia Park.

On the Manuel Antonio National Park: we have mixed feelings. If you’re going to go, make sure your group is small - we had a large group of 1 guide to about 10 adults and 3 small children, and it didn’t work very well. Every time we stopped took like 10 minutes for everyone to see, and the kids were constantly talking over the guide. It also took way longer than advertised- we were out for about 5 hours, when we were told it would be 2.5 hours. No food is allowed in the park, so by the end, we were tired, hot, and hungry. Our tour started early, but the park was still immensely crowded, and the bathrooms were particularly gnarly. It was a beautiful park, but we didn’t love the experience. 

**Other tips:**

\- Most of our excursions gave us the option to pay in USD, or pay with credit card but incur a hefty 13% fee. We paid USD to avoid the fee, but otherwise did not need any cash (USD or colones) the rest of the trip - everywhere took card

\- CR is a rise early, to bed early type place. We often saw the most wildlife first thing in the morning, so it’s worth getting up early!

\- Food was totally fine. We didn’t have a bad meal, but nothing blew our mind either. Emelio’s Cafe had *fabulous* coffee, and Agua Azul was delicious (but get there early, it’s tiny!)

\- Manuel Antonio is walkable, but small. There’s not a ton to “do” immediately in the town other than a few stops. For nearly all of our excursions, we had to take transportation to Quepos or otherwise. If we weren’t on the resort, I think we would have been bored staying in one place ",1,1770326885.0,CostaRicaTravel,0,1.0,False

I messaged you not too long ago. Sorry if that bothered you.

I kind of hoped for birthday wishes from you, but I don’t hold that against you at all.

I sometimes wonder, if we went for coffee, or just talked, what would I say? My mind tells me all these beautiful stories, how we would reconnect and fall in love again. But at the end of the day, we’re different now.

I’ve changed, and so have you. I do miss you, still. But I’m sure that the person I miss, is somewhat gone. I do hope you’ve grown to be even more of an amazing person, and learned to have understanding and love for yourself.

I would choose you. But I fear the fact is, that what we had would never be true again. At the same time, I wouldn’t mind learning who you are now. But that’s selfish, right? Maybe that’s a part of me, that wants to make it right for you, even though it’s too late.

1qwy2bt,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenHFY/comments/1qwy2bt/kate_pt6/,Kate pt-6,"Kate connected to the galley through the small console on the low table, pulling up the evening menu with a few quick taps. Holographic options scrolled past—grilled proteins, fresh salads from hydroponics, local Haego seafood equivalents. She paused on a fillet of silver-scaled Haego rockfish, pan-seared with herb butter and citrus glaze.

She glanced at Wyatt. “Is fish okay?”

Wyatt nodded, leaning back on the couch. “Fish is perfect.”

Kate smiled, then added, “I know we’ve been having the bourbon… but a beer always goes well with fish.”

Wyatt’s eyes crinkled. “Wine too, if you want.”

He reached over and pointed to a selection on the menu—Newtown Pale Ale, brewed right on Haego from the brewery he still owned even from orbit. The description read: Crisp, citrus-forward, with a clean finish. Brewed in small batches under the same gravity well that makes it taste like home.

Kate’s smile widened. “If you’re going to be part of Newtown,” Wyatt said quietly, “you should try your beer.” Kate my beer I like the sound of that 

Wyatt, yes and wait until you meet Jeff . 

She turned to him, eyes soft, and leaned in. The kiss was gentle at first—grateful—then lingered, deepening just enough to say everything the words hadn’t yet. When she pulled back, she rested her forehead against his for a heartbeat.

“Order it,” she whispered. “All of it.”

Wyatt tapped the console. Minutes later the delivery chime sounded.

The meal arrived on two trays: golden fillets of rockfish, flaky and fragrant, with roasted root vegetables, a bright green salad, the pale ale in chilled bottles, and a small carafe of red wine on the side. They ate slowly, conversation light—comments on the fish, the way the beer carried just the right bite of citrus, how the wine cut through the richness perfectly. No heavy topics. Just the simple pleasure of sharing food and quiet company.

By 2100 hours the trays were cleared, the bottles nearly empty. Wyatt stood, stretching slightly.

“It’s been a nice evening,” he said, voice low. “But… I’d like to go for a walk.”

Kate, still seated in the low chair, went blank for a second—surprise flickering across her face. She didn’t know what was coming. Her heart gave a small, uncertain thud.

Then Wyatt extended his hand.

“I don’t wish to walk alone.”

Kate’s expression bloomed into a slow, relieved smile. She rose, slipped her hand into his, and tucked herself against his side. He wrapped an arm around her shoulders. They stepped out into the corridor together.

The halls were quiet—night cycle lighting dimmed to soft amber, most crew off-shift. They strolled slowly, no destination, just moving. Past bulkheads etched with unit insignias, past the occasional night-watch crew member who nodded respectfully and kept walking.

Clara’s voice brushed Kate’s mind—gentle, warm.

Kate?

Clara.

Do you know the story… when he was a boy? The one with the friends 

Kate’s breath caught. She glanced up at Wyatt, who was looking straight ahead, a small, private smile on his face.

I do, and the Drazzan she sent back. He told me tonight.

A long pause. Then Clara’s mental voice, thick with emotion.

Welcome to our family, Kate.

Kate swallowed, eyes stinging. She squeezed Wyatt’s hand.

They turned a corner and arrived at the composers’ quarters—shared common area for the senior officers. The door was open. Inside, Raquel, Declan, and Leo sat in the low chairs around the central table, playing a quiet hand of cards by soft light. They looked up as Wyatt and Kate entered.

Raquel caught Kate’s eye and winked—slow, knowing, delighted.

Wyatt didn’t stop. He led Kate straight through the common area toward his private quarters at the back. No words. No explanation needed.

The door to his room slid shut behind them.

—

0300 hours.

Kate opened the door quietly, stepping out into the common area.

Raquel sat there—alone now—legs crossed, a tablet balanced on her knee, a faint smile playing on her lips.

Kate stopped, blinking. “You don’t have to guard the door. No one’s going to get in.”

Raquel’s smile widened. “I just started my posting thirty minutes ago. Orders are not to let anyone out.” She winked. “Not tonight.”

Kate exhaled a soft laugh, shaking her head. “Go to bed, Raquel. He’s not going anywhere. And do me a favor—order breakfast at 0700, please. For two. In his quarters.”

Raquel stood, stretching. “Already queued. Eggs, ham, toast, jam, coffee, extra grape juice. I’ll make sure it’s hot.”

Kate stepped forward and pulled her into a quick hug. “Thank you.”

Raquel hugged back—strong, brief—then stepped away. “Sleep well, Kate. Or… don’t.”

Kate’s laugh was quiet. “Goodnight.”

Raquel left. Kate slipped back inside.

Wyatt’s breathing was deep and even now—heavy with sleep. She slid back into bed, resting her head on his chest. His arm came around her instinctively, even half-asleep. She listened to his heartbeat—steady, strong—and let herself drift off again.

—

0600 hours.

Clara’s quarters.

Clara’s voice came through Declan’s comm—clear, calm, amused.

Declan—come to my quarters. Now.

605. Declan arrived, still in yesterday’s uniform, eyes slightly red-rimmed.

Clara looked up from her desk, smiling. “I believe Wyatt is taking the day off.”

Declan blinked slowly. “Yes, ma’am.”

“Take over his duties. And Declan…” She tilted her head. “You look like you didn’t sleep.”

Declan rubbed the back of his neck. “We were on sentry duty last night.”

Clara’s eyebrow rose. “Who is ‘we’?”

“All of us,” he said simply. “Raquel, Leo, Reyes , Gregor me. Took shifts outside his quarters. Just in case.”

Did not want him to get out 

Clara, laughing 

Cynthia, who had been leaning against the wall, snorted softly. “Declan—I’ll be canceling your workouts today. Get some rest.”

Clara nodded. “And Declan… I’m giving you a direct order. Lt. Kate Hill “Staples” will need an escort as liaison from Earth. Starting today.”

Declan straightened. “Yes, ma’am.”

Clara’s smile was gentle but firm. “And Declan—hopefully she will be addressed as Lt. Staples in the near future.”

Declan’s eyes widened—just a fraction—then he nodded once.

“Understood, Princess.”

He turned to leave. At the door he paused.

“Tell her… we’ve got her six. All of us.”

Clara’s voice followed him, soft and certain.

“I will.”

The door closed.

0650 Clara , Cynthia go check on Wyatt make sure he is off duty today . 

Cynthia you mean torture him ,

In Wyatt’s quarters, the chrono ticked toward 0700. Breakfast would arrive soon

0700 – Wyatt’s Quarters

Wyatt woke slowly, the soft golden light of the simulated Haego sunrise filtering through the viewport. For a long moment he lay still, staring at the overhead bulkhead, trying to piece together the strange new gravity that had settled over his life in the last twenty-four hours. The weight of Kate’s head on his chest, her slow, even breathing, the warmth of her body curled against his—it was real. Not a dream, not a sim run, not another late-night watch fantasy.

He shifted carefully, propping himself up on one elbow. Kate stirred but didn’t wake fully, just murmured something incoherent and nestled closer.

Wyatt looked down at her—hair tousled across the pillow, lips slightly parted, peaceful in a way he hadn’t seen before. A quiet wonder moved through him. This was happening. She was here. And somehow, impossibly, she wanted to stay.

He exhaled slowly. “I need to get dressed for the day,” he said, voice low, mostly to himself.

Kate cracked one eye open, sleepy smile curving her lips. “Five more minutes.”

He chuckled under his breath. “Duty doesn’t care about five more minutes.”

Before he could swing his legs out of bed, a firm knock sounded at the door.

“Enter,” Wyatt called.

Kate instinctively pulled the sheet higher, covering herself to the shoulders, though her eyes sparkled with amusement.

The door slid open.

Cynthia stepped through in full red Royal Guard armor—plates gleaming, posture impeccable, but her expression was anything but formal. The moment she saw Kate half-hidden under the sheet and Wyatt sitting beside her, shirtless and clearly just awake, her lips twitched into a wide, knowing grin.

“Well,” Cynthia said, voice rich with satisfaction, “good morning, you two.”

Wyatt’s face went carefully blank—his default when he was trying not to react.

Kate just laughed softly, propping herself up on one elbow, sheet still clutched modestly. “Morning, Cynthia.”

Cynthia crossed her arms, leaning against the doorframe. “Lt. Hill—Clara needs you to sign some papers today. Official ones. Liaison status, permanent attachment to the Nori Navio, Earth Navy rank retained. All the pretty stamps and seals.”

Wyatt blinked once. Then again. Slowly turned his head toward Kate.

Kate met his gaze and smiled—small, soft, a little shy. “Surprise?”

Wyatt’s blank expression cracked. A slow, genuine smile spread across his face—relief, wonder, something deeper. “Permanent liaison.”

Cynthia’s grin widened. “She didn’t tell you.”

Kate shrugged one shoulder. “It came up yesterday. Clara made the call. I’m staying. Officially.”

Wyatt exhaled a quiet laugh, rubbing the back of his neck. “Of course she did.”

Cynthia pushed off the doorframe, eyes dancing between them. “Wyatt… looks like you’ve been working on that first baby already.”

Wyatt’s ears went red instantly. He ducked his head, a flush climbing his neck.

Kate winked at Cynthia. “We’re… practicing.”

Cynthia barked a short, delighted laugh. “Clearly.”

She sobered just a fraction, turning to Kate. “You up for sparring later? Same time, same mat?”

Kate winced theatrically, shifting under the sheet. “Uh… I’m a little sore.”

Cynthia’s smile turned wicked. “I’ll let Clara know you’ll see her for lunch instead. Paperwork, then food. No excuses.”

Kate shook her head, laughing despite herself. “Fine. Lunch. Paperwork. No sparring. I yield.”

Cynthia gave a mock salute. “Smart woman.” She glanced at Wyatt one last time—her expression softening into something almost tender. “Take the day if you want it, Wyatt. Declan’s already covering your watch. We’ve got it handled.”

Wyatt looked at her—really looked. “Thanks, Cyn.”

She nodded once. “Family’s got your back. Both of you now.”

With that, she turned and stepped back into the corridor. The door hissed shut behind her.

Silence settled again—warm, comfortable, intimate.

Wyatt looked down at Kate. She was watching him, eyes bright.

“Permanent,” he said quietly.

Kate reached up, brushed her fingers along his jaw. “Permanent.”

He leaned down and kissed her—slow, lingering, full of everything he still didn’t have words for yet.

When he pulled back, he rested his forehead against hers.

“Breakfast is coming at 0700,” he murmured. “Then… maybe we talk about what permanent looks like. On Haego. With heelers. And redheaded kids.”

Kate’s smile was blinding. “I’d like that.”

He kissed her again—briefer, lighter—then finally swung out of bed.

“Duty calls,” he said, reaching for a clean uniform.

Kate propped herself on one elbow, sheet slipping just enough to make him pause and look back. “Duty can wait five more minutes.”

Wyatt laughed—low, real—and climbed back in beside her.

Five minutes, it turned out, became ten.

Then fifteen, hour

There are many reasons why I left but the main reason, is because my parents are super borderline maga Christian, you know? 😐✋My husband is trans, we have known each other our whole lives and I've watched him through his transition and helped with it. 🫶

My parents don't agree with this and tried to pull us apart when we were dating. I was 18 years old when we started to date so they didn't really have a right to butt into my personal life. I was also trying to pull away and become my own person and they hated that. So they did what ANY good parent did, and spread rumors at our church that I'm sleeping around. 🤓 

I had an encounter with a member of our church once. (Let's call her B) B had only been at the church for a few months and was married to one of the pastors there. I had talked to her in the past on occasion and she was nice and polite, but encounter was off putting. I was sitting in the back, enjoying the music when B had walked up to me. It started off fine with simple greetings but soon the conversation turned...sour.. it went like this;

B: I remember when I was your age,

Me: hm?

B: I was partying at night, drinking and than going to church doing the day and acting like a good girl.

Me: 😄 what?

B: if you ever want to talk to someone about that, I know how it feels to live a double life. 

Me: I'm not sure I-

B: We can get coffee or go for a walk. I see you as a little sister, and as your big sister I want to guide you in the ""right"" direction 

Me:...Thanks, I guess.

B: think about it. We all live in sin but just because the sin tastes good doesn't mean we should feed into it

Me: r i g h t..

B: \*smiles and stand up\* glad we can talk, I'll text you soon when we can hangout \*walks off\*

So did anyone else get uncomfortable? Because DAMN I USE WAS 😭 this random lady I had only talked to maybe twice too, just assumed so much about me and gave herself the big sister titled and walked off. For the record I had not been sleeping around once, I had only moved out two weeks prior to this conversation and my parents were already saying stuff about me behind my back. 🫤

After that conversation, things started to change fast. People stopped talking to me, many people avoided me or turned on the heels to not walk by me. People I had known since I was a child were now treating me like they never knew me. I felt so isolated and alone in the place I had seen has a hole or a safe place for so long. Childhood memories in my church, turned sour and bitter. Simple conversations with friends there became empty and left me feeling alone. The adults in my life felt foreign and complete strangers. I had served in the church for years and now was seen as a problem, a mistake, a flaw, all because I didn't follow the ""traditional"" way of their life. 🥲

I haven't been back since, I haven't seen anyone from my past church since than. And for my parents..I haven't talked to them since then either, I cut them off and the rest of my blood family for so many other reasons. I can go more into that later :D

**Bundles and Promo Codes**

If you purchase a bundle such as the [Barista Creations Flavor Pack](https://www.nespresso.com/us/en/order/capsules/original/barista-creations-flavor-pack-espresso), the sleeves included in the bundle count toward the sleeve requirement for promotional codes.

**Original / Vertuo Codes**

Nespresso often runs parallel promotions for both Original and Vertuo lines. Many (not all) of the promo codes are formatted as such: [WORD][YY] for Original, or [WORD][YYYY] for Vertuo. If you receive a marketing e-mail with a promo code of LATTE18 that requires the purchase of Original sleeves, you may be able to change the code to LATTE2018 and it will apply to the purchase of Vertuo sleeves instead. This also comes into play if the code uses the word COFFEE or ESPRESSO, these are generally interchangeable for both lines. It is also common for Original line deals to require more sleeves to be purchased- for example 25 vs 20 sleeves for the Vertuo line code.

**New Customers**

Nespresso typically defines a new customer as someone who has placed fewer than 3 orders. You may need to place one order before you qualify for new customer promotions, such as the welcome gifts. If you are an existing customer with more than 3 orders on record, you can create a new account to take advantage of new customer promotions and coupon codes.

**NOTE:** Not all limited-time promotions are available to all customers. If a code is not expired but does not work for you, it may be a targeted promotion.",3,1770326155.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False

I’d be curious if it was more “for me” on the skin. It just didn’t sing to me! If you wear this - know you smell good!

I had the opportunity to smell the new tom ford figue erotique. I only hate it just enough to kind of love it! It’s interesting, I’d call it sexy. It’s like primal, green, fig, nighttime scent that’s on the “dirty” side - not the clean side. It’s ALMOST bad but it’s interesting and captivating in a bad girl way so it’s quite good actually! My boyfriend likes it most of the 5 scents I brought home!

I smelled a few of the MM replica line 🥰 I smelled springtime in a park (liked but didn’t sing to me), autumn vibes (didn’t quite like but not bad), coffee break which I looveeeeeee for the men in my life!!!!!! But I think it’d read too masculine on me. It was quite good! I liked the coffee notes, and they’re pretty spicy and almost woody but not quite. A bit creamy but not overly so. A gourmand, but the lavender gives it a masculine twist that my partner reads as feminine. Must be very unisex. I don’t think I’d like this one on me, but I’d like it on a guy for sure! I’ll try it someday, though!

Dancing on the Moon - Maison Margiela: This is the one I ended up wearing out of the store. I doused myself in it! It’s very strange floral but not overly feminine. It’s definitely unique! Hard to describe! Just smells interesting, which I appreciate. When I saw datura note I really hoped it was for me. I like it! Not my absolutely favorite scent in the world, but very good!

Miss Dior was a beautiful but again, didn’t sing to me. I would have to wear it but I’m skeptical. common is my first impression!

Daisy (Eau de Toilette) - Marc Jacobs: I wore this one in college. It’s just good. Floral, but classically good. I’ll probably get a bottle of this just for old time’s sake. I still like it so might as well!

Daisy Wild - Marc Jacobs: this one is very similar to the last, but does have a slightly different profile. All the Marc Jacob’s have a very similar scent. It’s hard to find the nuance. Usually I wouldnt like that, but I am just a fan of daisy!

1qwxsfs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttractionDynamics/comments/1qwxsfs/8_signs_a_guy_secretly_likes_you_the_psychology/,8 Signs a Guy Secretly Likes You: The Psychology That Actually Works,"Let me be real with you for a second. I spent way too many hours studying human attraction patterns, body language research, and relationship psychology because I kept missing obvious signals. Turns out, most of us are terrible at reading romantic interest. We either see signs that aren't there or completely miss the ones staring us in the face. I dove into evolutionary psychology studies, watched way too many behavioral analysis videos, and even read through academic papers on nonverbal communication. What I found was fascinating and honestly made me rethink everything I thought I knew about attraction.

Here's the thing nobody tells you. We're biologically wired to be confusing as hell when we like someone. It's not intentional sabotage. Our nervous system literally goes into fight or flight mode around people we're attracted to. The sympathetic nervous system kicks in, which explains the sweating, the fumbling, the weird behavior. Understanding this helped me realize that awkwardness isn't always a bad sign, sometimes it's the best sign.

**The eye contact thing is more complex than you think.** Research from the University of Chicago found that mutual gaze triggers activity in the brain's reward center, same area that lights up when you're high on cocaine. So when a guy holds eye contact with you for longer than normal, his brain is literally getting a dopamine hit. But here's where it gets interesting. If he likes you, you'll notice this pattern: he looks at you, you catch him, he looks away, then within seconds he's looking again. It's involuntary. His brain is seeking that reward. Watch for the double take. That's your golden ticket.

**Mirroring is the subconscious giveaway.** Dr. Tanya Chartrand's research on the chameleon effect shows that we automatically mimic people we're attracted to or want to connect with. If he starts drinking his coffee right after you do, crosses his legs when you cross yours, or leans in when you lean in, his subconscious is screaming ""I like you."" I started noticing this everywhere once I learned about it. The book [Invisible Influence](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27276408-invisible-influence) by Jonah Berger breaks down how our behavior unconsciously syncs with people we're drawn to. This book completely changed how I view social interactions, not just romantic ones. Berger's a marketing professor at Wharton who makes behavioral science actually fun to read. The mirroring chapter alone is worth the price. Best part is how he explains why we do things without even realizing it.

**He remembers the random stuff you mentioned.** Memory and emotion are deeply connected in the brain's limbic system. When we care about someone, our brain flags their information as important and stores it differently. So when he brings up that you mentioned loving mint chocolate chip ice cream three weeks ago, or asks about your sister's job interview you casually mentioned, that's his brain literally prioritizing you. It's not just being polite. Research shows we have terrible memory for details from people we're neutral about, but amazing recall for people who trigger emotional responses.

**The proximity pattern is telling.** Studies on interpersonal space show that we unconsciously reduce distance with people we're attracted to. Edward Hall's proxemics research found that intimate space is typically 6 to 18 inches, and we only allow people we trust or like into that zone. If he's always finding reasons to be physically near you, sitting close when there's plenty of space, or ""accidentally"" bumping into you, he's testing the boundaries. Also watch for touch. Even brief, seemingly accidental touches on your arm or shoulder release oxytocin, the bonding hormone. If he's creating opportunities for physical contact, even small ones, his body is trying to build connection.

**Voice changes are a dead giveaway.** Men's voices actually deepen when they're talking to someone they're attracted to, according to research published in the Journal of Nonverbal Behavior. It's an evolutionary thing, deeper voices signal masculinity and genetic fitness. But there's another pattern too. He might also talk faster or stumble over words because adrenaline and cortisol are flooding his system. The Podcast [""Where Should We Begin""](https://open.spotify.com/show/3fKOTwtnX5oZLaiNntKWAV) by Esther Perel has incredible episodes on communication patterns in relationships. Perel's a psychotherapist who literally just records real couples therapy sessions, obviously anonymous. The way she breaks down what people are really saying versus what they think they're saying is mind blowing. You start hearing subtext everywhere.

**He gets weirdly competitive or tries to impress you.** Testosterone spikes when men are around women they're attracted to, especially if other men are present. This triggers status seeking behavior. Suddenly he's telling stories where he's the hero, showing off skills, or trying to one up other guys in the conversation. It can seem obnoxious but it's basically peacocking. His brain is screaming ""pick me."" Evolutionary psychologists call this intrasexual competition and it's hardwired. David Buss writes about this extensively in his work on mating strategies. Not saying it's attractive behavior necessarily, but it's definitely a sign.

**The availability test is huge.** If he's consistently making time for you, rearranging plans, or showing up to things he normally wouldn't care about, he's prioritizing you. We make time for what we value, full stop. Psychology research on time perception shows that we're incredibly stingy with our time for people who don't matter to us, but weirdly generous with people we care about. Notice if he's the one initiating hangouts or if he jumps at invitations. That enthusiasm isn't random.

**He's different around you than other people.** This is subtle but crucial. Maybe he's normally loud and jokes around with everyone, but gets quieter and more genuine with you. Or he's typically reserved but becomes animated when you're talking. Behavioral shifts indicate you're triggering something different in him. 

If going through all these books and resources feels overwhelming, there's an app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that's actually worth checking out. It's a personalized learning platform that pulls from relationship psychology books, dating experts, and research on attraction to create custom audio lessons based on your specific goals, like understanding attraction dynamics or improving communication in dating. 

You can tell it exactly what you're working on, maybe becoming more confident reading signals or navigating early dating as an introvert, and it builds a structured learning plan just for you. The content comes from vetted sources like the books and experts mentioned here, and you can adjust how deep you want to go, from quick 15 minute summaries to detailed 40 minute deep dives with real examples. Plus there's a virtual coach you can ask questions to anytime. Makes digesting all this psychology research way more manageable when you're actually living through it.

Look, human attraction is messy and doesn't follow a perfect script. These signs aren't guarantees, they're patterns. Sometimes a guy is just friendly. Sometimes he's socially awkward with everyone. But if you're seeing multiple signals consistently, your gut is probably right. Our brains are actually pretty good at pattern recognition when we're not overthinking it. Biology and psychology give us frameworks, but trust what you're observing. The research just confirms what you likely already sense.",2,1770325893.0,AttractionDynamics,0,1.0,False

**Fantasy entrepreneurs get what they deserve.**

Not a whole lot to say, but this was a fun and obviously cozy read. Everybody and their mum knows this by now but: It’s about a former mercenary who decides to hang up their sword and open a coffee shop in a fantasy town where nobody even knows what coffee is. Naturally, this leads to all kinds of low-stakes chaos and slice-of-life shenanigans as people react to this strange new drink and the equally strange person selling it.

The real strength of the story is the cast. Watching the shop slowly grow and take root is very satisfying, especially because of the character dynamics. Everyone bounces off each other in a way that feels warm and natural, and even the quieter characters (Thimble stole my heart) end up being genuinely lovable. By the end, I found myself rooting for all of them. You actually feel happy for these people, which is kind of the whole point of cozy fantasy, and it definitely delivers on that front.

It’s feel-good fiction at its finest, and the ending is surprisingly vindicating. Everything comes together in a way that feels earned and wholesome.

That said, this isn’t really my cup of tea (pun fully intended). I wanted to try the genre, and I’m glad I did. I enjoyed it for what it was, but I don’t think I’ll be diving into cozy fantasy anytime soon. Still, if you like low-stakes stories, found family vibes, and gentle humor, this one will probably hit just right.

I (31 female), am married to the love of my life (33 male). His father, we’ll call him Jeff, has been fighting for his life for over 20 years. Jeff has a genetic disease, that basically shuts down your kidneys first, then your hearing, your eyesight, etc.. He's had two kidney transplants, that failed, and has been on dialysis all these years. My mother in law, who we’ll call Marie, ended up having to become the bread winner, and became a working mother of four. Eventually, Jeff was able to get back to work, but the hispital debt became too much. Around 2012 ish (I’m not sure of the exact year since I wasn’t in the family then), my sister in law (Jeff’s daughter), we’ll call her Stacey, and her husband, we’ll call him Dick, came to an agreement with my mother and father in law. Stacey, and Dick, would buy the house, but allow Jeff, and Marie to live there while paying a discounted rent. At the time, they also agreed that it would kind of be under the guise that Jeff, and Marie still owned the home. Basically, Dick, and Stacey wouldn’t act like the landlord. Jeff and Marie were pretty desperate at the time, so, they did it. I don’t blame them for doing it, but there were no legal documents made, or even papers laying out all of the agreements. Originally, Dick, and Stacey agreed that they wouldn’t use the house for profit, but that they would sell it either back to Jeff and Marie if they were ever able to, OR sell it to one of the other siblings at a decent price. Well, all these years, and no one but my husband and I have ever been interested in buying it. We have talked with Dick, and Stacey about this on and off the past ten years. Dick has told my husband to tell him whenever we were ready, and a price we’d be willing to pay. Finally, and, unfortunately, because of my father in laws declining health this past year, we made the decision to move in with them. Jeff, and Marie needed help, and someone to be at the house during the day in case anything happened while Marie was at work. As a full time mom, that would be me. We would also help out with the rent (that had gone up significantly in the past few years), cooking, grocery shopping, maintenance, lawn care etc.. We were excited at first thinking we‘d live there for a year or two, then work on buying the place. BUT, about a month before we were to move in Dick told Marie that they wouldn’t  be selling us the home. Dick, and Stacey decided that they wanted to keep the house so that THEIR kids could live there (with grandma) in their college years. Yep. You just read that right. After all these years talking about it, they won’t sell us the house. Marie told me, and I told my husband. Obviously, we were extremely mad. We even contemplated not even moving in anymore. We decided that instead of planning, and saving to buy that house that we’d plan, and save during our time with my in laws, and gtfo to our own home asap. We’ve been here almost a whole year, and it’s been fine. My husband brought the yard back to life, made several improvements to the home, including fixing the dryer, adding a shower to my in laws bathroom, unclogging their bathtub, painting, fixing their truc, etc.. Jeff has made a huge turn around with my home cooked meals, and our morning coffee chats. Marie always tells me how it’s because of me that he’s alive right now. My kids have been able to make cherished memories with their grandparents, and I’m so glad they could be in close proximity before Jeff decides to go. Jeff is still not well enough to work. In fact, he sleeps for most of his day, but even that’s gotten better for him. Dialysis is the only things keeping him alive right now. Anyway, now to the point of all of this! I’m getting sick and tired of Stacey, and Dick. Their agreement of “not acting like the landlord” should be null and void at this point since they’re not upholding any other agreement they made. Marie, and Jeff need  more help than what we can afford. We’re also supposed to be saving while here, and it’s just not happening. They need a new dryer, and help with things like a plumber, or someone to put the rain gutters back on their house (that Dick took off, might I add). They need things that a landlord should take care of. My mother in law was having a mental breakdown the other day saying that none of her kids (besides us) know what’s going on, and she’s tired of having to be the man, and she’s tired of having to work so hard, and she didn’t want to do it anymore. She’s tired. Jeff does dialysis at home, and Marie is the one who sets up the machine, hooks him up, and then goes back and forth all night bringing him things he needs/ making sure he’s okay. For 20 PLUS YEARS. Anyway, I told her that maybe they need to reach out to Dick and Stacey to see if they can help out a bit. She refused and said the last time they reached out they were told that “they don’t do that”. I’m pissed off. Jeff, and Marie always just skirt around the problem, never wanting to bother Dick and Stacey. Because they’ve already helped so much by buying the house, apparently. Well, let me tell you how Dick and Stacey are doing! They have multiple properties, so they know how to be landlords. Not only do they have that income, but they both work. They own their home, and can afford to put all their kids in sports, go on week long Disney trips staying in Disney hotels, year round fishing, hunting, camping, all the gear that those require, including an annual Alaska fishing trip, to get a new roof, and re-do their whole front yard. I‘m not saying that they didn’t work hard to earn those things, but what I’m saying is that maybe some of that could be extended to Stacey’s dying father, and his type one diabetic working mother. My husband, and I are not well off. We struggle to save, and had hoped that buying my in laws house would be our one opportunity to have a home in this crazy market. We are the only ones who don’t own a home. I asked my mother in law if she ever wanted to know whether Dick and Stacey had ever taken a heloc or some sort of loan on the home (which would explain why rent has increased), and she said she’s thought about it, and assumes that they have, but hasn’t looked into it because she doesn’t want to be completely crushed. My mother and father in law choose to stay ignorant so that they won’t face disappointment, and it really makes me mad. All that to say, I’m ten seconds away from cutting off Dick and Stacey. I know that’s my husbands sister, whatever, he’s got another one that I’m cool with, but I can’t comprehend my sister ever treating my parents that way. I can’t imagine treating your family like that. These past holidays were torture being around them, and I don’t know how much more I can take of them. Would I be an ass hole if I cut them off, and none of my other in laws?",1,1770325774.0,familydrama,0,1.0,False

Long contracts, night watches, stress, isolation, rough seas, rougher days. Slowly it had become my ""pause button"" - something to relax, to reset, to feel normal in an abnormal life. On board, it felt harmless. Everyone does it. One more cigarette after watching, one more with coffee, one more before sleep.

That ""one more"" became 20+ a day.

Eight years were lost that way.

I was still playing sports, still felt fit, so I convinced myself my lungs were fine. Turns out they were just tolerating the abuse — until they couldn’t.

Recently, I was diagnosed with small airway obstruction.

It's not permanent yet.

""The doctor said it's reversible-only if I quit now.""

Today marks 1 week of being smoke-free.

Not gonna lie, it's uncomfortable. But the discomfort feels like healing instead of damage.

I didn't quit because I wanted to be ""healthy "".

I quit because my lungs gave me a deadline.

Posting here for accountability, and maybe to reach someone who thinks ""I'm still fine, I'll quit later.""

It comes later than you think.

1qwxmyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1qwxmyx/i_thought_cancer_would_change_my_stepmom_for_the/,"I thought cancer would change my stepmom for the better, but it just amplified the worst parts of her.","My relationship with my stepmom has not been the easiest. My real mom died from a decades long addiction, and my dad met my stepmom hardly two months after. This was always a really bitter tale for me, but it’s been 11 years and I’ve matured in my 20’s. I’ve learned to like her, love her even, but she will never be my mom.

My real mom could be moody (mental illness was definitely a factor), but she was so warm. She would offer you hugs out of nowhere, cuddle me, spend real quality time with me, and take me on adventures. Losing that at 17 took years to cope through.

My stepmom (let’s say Ruth) is the complete opposite. She is cold, temperamental, reactive, and honestly neurotic. She is more often than not in a bad mood, especially when it comes to my brother and I. Growing up, I hated her for years. I’ve called her horrible names, which i now regret. But especially in her home, you can never do anything right. You’re either too loud, in the way, making a mess, no matter what you do. Only she is allowed to be loud, in the way, or be making a mess if you get my drift. You can never do enough to please her and it’s always been exhausting. She also is extremely controlling of my father. He can’t do this, that, but half the time - he puts his foot down and says “I don’t care, I’m golfing Sunday.” It’s always bothered me, especially when she says he can’t go grab dinner with my brother and I.

I live 18 hours away, so when I visit, it’s usually for a week or more at a time. Over the years, I’ve learned to just do chores without asking what she needs. It means more to her and it’s the easiest way to get her off your back. Now that I live on my own with my husband, I’m active around the house cooking, cleaning, picking up, etc - it’s easier to visit and repeat the same patterns I have in my own home.

Last year, they got married. The year before that, naturally got engaged. For some reason - she was a saint during this time, especially because I helped plan the engagement during a family photoshoot. Our relationship grew and for the first time we started talking on the phone at least once a week. It felt like maybe she actually accepted me as family, so she was treating me with kindness and love.

Then last fall, bam. Horrible news. Ruth was in the hospital and they found cancer. After going into surgery and getting blood tests, the cancer was found to have spread to another organ and in the lymph nodes, which meant Chemo.

Since I live so far away, I only heard things from a distance. I started to feel really guilty hearing how much she was struggling, my sister was depressed and needed my support, and my dad was tired. So I took FMLA at work, and have been visiting for a few weeks… and boy. Ruth is miserable. And not from the chemo, because she says she physically feels great after the last session two weeks ago.

She has become everything I remember when we first met, but worse. I can’t even believe it’s possible. But now it’s framed as “well she has cancer, you don’t get it.”

She has become incredibly judgmental about small things, because now she eats “completely organic,” if I walk in with a flavored iced coffee, I am judge beyond comprehension (even though I have been active 5x a week for years, work in public health, and eat very clean focusing on a high protein & veggie diet). Yet, I call her a “picky eater” jokingly and she had my dad sit me down saying I am inconsiderate because she has cancer.

She yells at my father when he mentions wanting to go do something with his friends, even though she’s back to working full time and completely active out of treatment. She says “you cannot leave me alone, you’re not going.” She wouldn’t even let him go to dinner with my siblings last week, even though we went at 5pm to accommodate him being home early.

Yesterday I was yelled at for “cleaning the kitchen out of order” because the counters NEED to be wiped before I do the dishes!!! Heaven forbid.

I bought and cleaned a package of blueberries and grabbed a handful, as she walked by she exclaims “wow, can you save some for me?”

I got an Oura ring for Christmas that was too big. I ordered a new ring from Best Buy, because Costco was sold out. I was waiting for the new ring before returning the old one just to make sure I was right about the sizing. I was yelled at when the new ring came in, and I didn’t re-package/reset the old one first, because “I was going to mix the rings up and ruin the return.” Even though, it’s VERY clear for Oura what charges belong to what rings.

She has become incredibly snappy, aggressive, and controlling, more than I’ve ever seen. I sat down with my dad and even said “should I go home? I feel completely unwanted here.” It is passive aggressive comments after comments, all day long. It’s so exhausting. I thought I could be cranky sometimes if I’m PMSing, but it’s genuinely her entire being. I’m so thankful I’m not angry at the world.

I gave stupid examples, but there have been so many things that have happened, I can’t even remember them all. I am so sad to say, she has completely regressed our relationship. I can’t stand who she is and she reminded me of why I never liked her for years.

I thought cancer would change her and make her more appreciative at life, but she genuinely seems like she hates everyone around her, even though her prognosis is great. I’m genuinely wondering if it’s common for people with cancer to act like this. I’ve done nothing but try to help and be present for my family, and it’s met me with resentment and anger.

TLDR; it took years for me to like my stepmom, just for cancer to turn her into the worst version of herself.  I came into town with compassion and the will to do whatever was needed, and I’m leaving feeling like I never want to come back.",8,1770325565.0,TrueOffMyChest,2,1.0,False

We are a small coffee shop, and of course we use Uber Eats to deliver.

  
About 6 months ago, we stopped receiving deposits from Uber. I've had several tickets open, the most recent one has been open for almost 2 months with no actual response from Uber.

We've been sending orders out the whole time because I truly believe that if I shut down UberEats customers will simply order from another store.

They need to do a Video Verification phone call to even have the right department look at the issue. And for months now they keep emailing us asking for appropriate times to do the call. I email them back in 5 minutes every time with a full week worth of options.

  
Every single time I get no response for a week or more, and then the same copy + pasted response asking for appropriate times to do the video call.

Then I call and complain, customer support says they can't contact any teams outside their own. All they can do is put another response in the ticket.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? Did you just keep waiting and waiting and hope they resolve the issue?

Customer support tells me repeatedly that there is zero ability to escalate a ticket, and that all I can do is wait and hope someone gets back to me.

And I’m proud of you for trying to read something to help with the pain and grow. :’)

I am close to two months post breakup with who I thought was the love of my life. (Me: F26, him: M33). He broke up with me and while I rationally understand why we weren’t working, it doesn’t make the pain and constant aching for him go away. He taught me so much about love and life, the good the bad and the ugly. I miss his presence constantly. He was my best friend. My confidant. Someone who pushed me to be my absolute best self, but we also brought our bad sides of one another during conflict and insecurity. What a concept, to both love so deeply and so hard and to care so much, but it just does not work out. It is TRAGIC. I am still untangling the mess and trying to understand. I think about what he would say in response to everything going on in my life and I honestly just feel more hollow a lot of the time. I feel like I am less interesting than i was now that I am alone, and don’t get to bask and grow in the light he shone on me and I am mourning the person I was with him, and the identity I got to live while in the relationship.

So yeah, I am going through a major heart break, identity crisis, and it’s a lot. I want to say to everyone going through this, I am so sorry. This shit is SO HARD. I never knew, i thought people were being dramatic but now, i see what people talked about. I see why heartbreak inspires art and music and creativity, because it brings out your biggest, loudest, hardest emotions and feelings.

All this context to say, I am by no means healed. No means over him. I cry a lot still. I hear a song we loved or a phrase he used or just anything can trigger a memory and it feels like a weight it on my chest. I love him. I wish him nothing but good, I will never be a ‘fuck him’ person. He was a great person. But we didn’t work, not right now. And I can’t even say with confidence that if he called tomorrow, I would be able to say that “right now, we aren’t the best, healthiest versions of ourselves for one another, we can’t be together.” I just don’t have the willpower (but he won’t call). and I have to somehow also come to some peace around the fact that he won’t ever be in my life again, even though the deep recesses of my brain doesn’t wanna let go of that hope ever. But as we stand today, we are not compatible. What a blow. What a waste of great chemistry and connection. Fuck.

I have been mourning this and have learned a lot through the pain and done a lot to try to keep distracted & wanted to share some ideas for others. Take the or leave them, but just things that have been useful for me thus far, as a not yet healed, but hoping for process person.

\*\*Things that have helped ease the pain a bit:\*\*

FIRST. you need to go no contact: I was 100% against this bc I wanted to try to win him back and didn’t wanna close the door etc etc. But listen, you cannot heal in the environment that hurt you. That goes for both you and your ex. You need space and time and so do they. Do not talk to them once you’ve/ they’ve. decided to end it. Do not plead, do not beg (coming from a hypocrite who 100% did everything you’re not suppose to do). They know you don’t want it to end. They know where you are. One more convo will not change a deep seeded issue. I haven’t blocked my ex (maybe bc I hope he’ll reach out, probably not healthy but hey, we’re being honest). But he blocked me on everything so I don’t need to and I haven’t seen anything from him and I’m not looking for it. I need all my focus to be on me. I’m already giving him a lot of my subconscious mindshare, the least i can do is take space back by not actively seeing things that will hurt me

\\- Delete the photos from easy access (I keep mine in Google Photos and have Google Photos block their face so it doesn’t pop up in memories), get rid of the physical triggers (don’t have to toss them but that’s up for debate too) but get them out of your day to day sight. These triggers are so hard and honestly feel like contact and connection still, but you (we) need to detox.

\\- Call you friends and family. Talk to them. Mourn. Cry. Scream. Make plans. Whatever. Even if you isolated yourself or don’t wanna burden people, we are here to be burdened. We are here to share and listen. It’s a part of the human experience. Do not suffer in silence. I don’t want that, they don’t want that. When it’s fresh, it is like a death and we need to process. For call you mom or grandma or friend or coach and just check in. Talk about the breakup or life or let the talk. But remember you are a whole person, albeit a bit bruised rn

\\- If you can’t call someone or hangout with them, at least be around people; a coffee shop, the library, a park, the movie theater, the gym, etc. cry around ppl if you need, who cares, we’re mourning. But leave your house. Touch grass. Be one with the outside world.

\\- See a therapist, even if it just gives you someone to talk too. I know this isn’t everyone’s thing, but it gives you a defined, constructive place to feel how you feel and I think it can’t hurt. I personally love my therapist and look forward to our sessions, even when they’re hard and emotional.

\\- Go on a walk every day. No excuses. And listen here, I live in Michigan and am going through a breakup during the coldest winter ever and the worst months of the year so it’s cold as balls but getting outside every day is healing. Bundle up. Go outside. Stop making excuses. It helps.

\\- Be around people without your phone or headphones. Just exist. Anthropologize the world around you. See the beauty through the pain. Remember that life is going on around you still and sometimes it can even make you crack a smile even when you’re so sad. Smile at people, just be nice. I think you’d be shocked by how great humans can be when we show a little empathy and kindness

\\- Just put your phone down in general. Stop doom scrolling. They’re not gonna call or text you and social media is gonna make you feel worse. Put it down. Do something else

\\-  Read more or get into audiobooks, trade your world for another

\\- Get into podcasts, I love podcasts and it cuts through the dark thoughts and gives me white noise and can be abt literally anything in the world

\\- Donate blood/ plasma, if you can. Good for the world, distracting, can make money, gets ya out of the house and has purpose.

\\- Find an individual hobby - I am bad at this bc my hobbies are socially driven but just try. Do puzzles, craft, play an instrument, something with your hands and not on a screen that brings you joy.

\\- Be active - whether than means gym or sports or walking or joining a bowling league or whatever but physical exertion is one of the only times I feel like my mind isn’t a one track of thoughts about my ex. And it’s also a great way to meet people

\\- Thrift/ fb marketplace things for your home that make it feel more homey and yours. This is fun, affordable, takes time and can be done gradually, and lets you remake a space that probably has a lot of memories of your ex

\\- Eat. Omg this one is huge. I still catch myself not eating but listen, we have given this relationship everything we could and guess what, it’s not coming back. And we cannot give up ourselves physically too. Eat 3 meals a day. If you can’t cook, take yourself out to eat. In a way, during a breakup, money doesn’t matter. We gotta get ourselves feeling right again.

\\- Sign up for something that you can work towards, a 5k, a pickleball contest, an art show, whatever. Have a purpose and sign up for something that drives that purpose. Even if you’re bad at it, who cares?

\\- Plan a trip, big or small. But something to look forward to, have on the calendar, and to get us out of the house.

\\- if you need to doom scroll, do so on Duolingo. Again, social media is NOT REAL. You algorithm knows you’re going through a breakup and will feed you stuff which you’ll watch and create a rabbit hole of content that isn’t healing you, it’s just going to be a mirror of what you wanna hear, not necessarily the truth or what you need to here. Find something better on your phone (or just put it down)

\*\*Helpful Content:\*\*

I guess I’ll call this goodbye… but let’s be honest, I’ve said “goodbye” like 14 times already and somehow I’m still here, emotionally pacing the room like I forgot my keys. So this one’s the official goodbye. The final cut. The director’s edition. No post-credit scenes, no surprise sequels, no “just checking in” texts at 2:37 a.m.
Picture it: dramatic music in the background, me walking away in slow motion like I’m in a movie, pretending I totally don’t look back even though I absolutely do. Except I trip over literally nothing, spill my drink, laugh at myself, and keep it moving anyway. That’s the vibe. Not sad, not bitter—just that awkward, funny, slightly unhinged energy of someone who’s finally figured out that life keeps going whether you’re ready or not.
This isn’t the tragic goodbye with rain and tears and long speeches about fate and timing. No sad violins. This is the upbeat version. The “I survived, I learned, I laughed at myself, and now I’m leaving with my dignity mostly intact” type of goodbye. The kind where you wave, smile, trip a little, laugh at it, and keep walking anyway like a magician who forgot his smoke bomb but still committed to the exit.
And here’s the part that still makes me laugh at the universe a little… the first time I saw you in a long time wasn’t some movie moment. Not a coffee shop, not running into each other on the street, not even a random grocery aisle reunion. No. Of course not. The first time I saw you again was on a live cam website. As you heard. Because apparently my life refuses to be normal even for five seconds.
In my head I always imagined this big cinematic reunion—slow motion, eye contact, background music, maybe a breeze for dramatic effect. Instead it was me staring at a screen thinking, wow… this is not the plot I expected, but here we are. Romantic? In the most modern, chaotic, slightly unhinged way possible. A love story brought to you by WiFi and bad decisions.
And I won’t even get into everything I saw. I don’t need to. The part that actually hit me wasn’t the shock, wasn’t the internet, wasn’t even the reality of it. It was this one thought that kept looping in my head:
you have a daughter.
You have a whole human being who looks up to you, learns from you, mirrors you. Someone who’s going to grow up seeing the version of you that you allow the world to see. And I’m sitting there realizing you let yourself be treated in ways I never imagined for the person I knew. That’s what hurt. Not the screen. Not the site. The contrast between who you are… and what you accept for yourself.
And that’s the part I couldn’t unsee. Not because I’m judging—more because I cared. Because I still see you as more than the situations you put yourself in. I still see the person I once loved, not just the version the world gets now.
And let me be very clear—because yeah, I’m actually funny, and also done—you don’t get to leave, then come back silently, then disappear again all indecisive like it’s some emotional boomerang. It doesn’t work like that. If you’re gone, go. Just go. Lose my memory. Leave me alone. I don’t want no part of it. Like, go… keep going… don’t even wave from the distance. Commit to the exit.
So yeah… goodbye. Not in a “the world is ending” way. More in a “I’m done overthinking, done replaying, done haunting the same memories like a ghost with WiFi” way. The fun kind of goodbye. The one where you close the door, shake your head, laugh, and say, damn… that was a chapter.
And at the end of the day, through it all, I love you, and I miss you. And I don’t think we’ll be having that talk anytime soon.
Good luck, Juli",1,1770324791.0,u_Electrical_Bet_4659,0,1.0,False

However, I feel like I have worked out a few of the issues that OpenClaw has from some of the posts I am seeing here, so I thought I would share my insights as I think this still has the potential to be a game-changing addition to a lot of people's workflows. MODS - if you feel this is useful, please pin.

For reference, I am using this on a dedicated Mini PC I had spare that has 16GB of RAM and an N97. You can pick one of these up for around $200 (I am in the US), so if you are committed to making a play of OpenClaw for the long term it works out more cost effective than paying a monthly fee for a VPS. That said, if you are messing around with it, you can get a VPS that will be more than capable for around $20 a month. I am also using Windows on my machine, much to the chagrin of my more technically-minded peers. Ensure you have Python installed.

I hope you find this useful - happy Clawdbotting!



**API Recommendations**  
This is a big one that I see on here a lot, as this makes a big difference to the viability of your Clawdbot. Alex Finn over on YouTube has some good advice which I used, plus found a bunch of stuff on my own. He has a great analogy of Brain and Muscles. When you go to the gym, you have your main brain which drives the thought process of what you want to work on and achieve when you are working out, but you go to specific machines or do specific exercises to train specific muscles. You need to apply that thought process to your Clawdbot. Some APIs/models are designed for specific instances, so you need to use them appropriately.

As far as costs go, for me I spent $42 on Opus for setup, and now I am spending about $60 a month (as long as Nvidia keeps providing Kimi 2.5 for free), but this includes some optional costs such as ElevenLabs for voice notes and a standalone SIM for Signal.

***Setup: Claude Opus***  
Not even close for anything else. It'll set you back \~$30-$50 in token costs, but I highly recommend that you manage all of your initial setup and do your onboarding with Opus. It will give your bot the most personality and it will set the tone for your entire experience using your Clawdbot after it's been set up.

***Ongoing General Use: Kimi 2.5 (especially via Nvidia)***  
Once setup, switch to Kimi 2.5 for your day-to-day use, and have this become the ""brain"" once your Opus setup has been complete and you have everything configured. If you register for an API key with Nvidia it is currently free. Ride that pony while it lasts. Even without Nvidia, if you buy credits directly from Moonshot it's about 10% of the cost of Claude Sonnet.

***Heartbeat***  
If Nvidia revokes free use of Kimi 2.5, then use Claude Haiku for the heartbeat. Using Haiku turns this from $10-$20 a month to <$1 a month.

***Coding: Deepseek Coder v2***  
Great for coding tasks and very cost effective. I have a Claude Max subscription that I use inside Claude by itself so my coding use is limited, but I did use it to put together some quite cool stuff for a personal project and I was impressed with the results. For most people $20 a month would be more than enough.

***Voice Recognition: OpenAI Whisper***  
There is a skill for this, and it works great for transcribing voice notes into text and actions. I use this fairly regularly and I'll spend around $3 this month.

***Image Generation: Gemini \\ Nano Banana Pro***  
There is a skill for this, get an API key from Google and plug it in. Definitely the best image one out there from my experience. I'm on track to spend around $10 this month.

***Memory:*** [***Supermemory.ai***](http://Supermemory.ai)  
This is free and a great way to keep your structure and memory backed up and saved (I will get onto memory structure later).

***Email: Nylas***  
This is free and allows me to connect to multiple email accounts across multiple platforms (Google and Microsoft 365) so they can all be managed by your Clawdbot.

***Web Search: Brave and Tavily***  
These are both free. Brave is great for general searching and Tavily is great for more specific use cases like scraping contacts etc.

***Optional: ElevenLabs Text-To-Speech (TTS)***  
This is punchy at $22 a month, but is great for converting my morning brief into a voice memo that I can listen to each morning while I am making my coffee (use case outlined below)

***Optional: Dedicated phone number for messaging***  
I use Signal exclusively for my Clawdbot. I use WhatsApp for most other things, but I wanted a dedicated channel for my interactions with my Clawdbot. This costs me $2 a month with Sonetel.

**################################**

**Tailscale**  
Install Tailscale on the Clawdbot machine and your main computer. As mentioned earlier I am operating on Windows (gasp!) and you can use Remote Desktop via Tailscale, and you can also then use it to control your Clawdbot via the web interface on any other machine that you have Tailscale installed on. It also means you don't need to have any RDP ports open on the server for Remote Desktop which is a ""nice to have"" for security.

**################################**

**Onboarding**  
This is one that I cannot stress enough - be as thorough as you can with your initial Clawdbot setup. You can give it a personality (this is where Opus shines) - don't be shy to have some fun and go into a lot of depth (mine is modelled after Ziggy from the 90's TV show Quantum Leap).

However, the biggest thing to do here is tell it as much about yourself as you can. Ask it to give you a very in-depth Q&A about yourself, your work habits, your personal habits, what you want to use it for, what things you are interested in, what content you watch, what foods you like, what sports you follow etc. - the better it knows you, the more helpful it will be.

Also, have a long think about what you want it to do for you. You need to think of AI agents as a ""digital immigrant"" who will work for 10c an hour to do basic tasks for you. The basic tasks are incredibly powerful when chained together into a work flow. Make sure that you explain very carefully to your Clawdbot all of the things that you want it to do for you as a part of your onboarding.

**################################**

**Memory**  
This is one that I see a lot of people complain about, that it forgets what you are talking about mid-sentence. Unlike ChatGPT which tells you it's out of context, Clawdbot will just automatically compact and forget as you go along - this can be hugely frustrating for the uninitiated.

Run this prompt - it sets you on the right path outside of the defaults to help with your memory management:  
*Enable memory flush before compaction and session memory search in my Clawdbot config. Set compaction.memoryFlush.enabled to true and set memorySearch.experimental.sessionMemory to true with sources including both memory and sessions. Apply the config changes.*

The best thing to do after you finish your onboarding, is setup a memory structure as a part of your heartbeat protocol, and also make sure you run /compact before you give it any workflow examples or agent setups. For example, before you explain to it how you want it to check your emails and you spend a bunch of time typing out the instructions, run /compact beforehand so that it has clear memory context.

After each task that you setup for it, ask it to commit that to memory so that it doesn't forget. Also make sure you ask it to check the memory before you start creating a new repetitive task so that it can include that in the context - as you will often find you chain basic repetitive things together.

I have a cron job setup for it once daily to check the memory and repeat back to me a summary of all the things it has saved for our workflows. If anything is not correct, tell it to correct what it needs to, and then repeat back the update. Once you get this and you are happy with it, make sure that it commits it to Supermemory (API I outlined above) and that way if anything goes askew on your local instance, you can restore from Supermemory.

Key takeaway here - make sure you /compact before any new task discussion, and make sure you tell it to commit things to memory and then repeat back what it has committed to make sure it's correct.

I run a manual backup once a week via Windows task scheduler to run a bat file that copies my .clawdbot folder into a backup folder on the PC. I also manually run Claude Desktop on the machine once a week to access the local filesystem (after my automated backup of my markdown, json, js and python scripts), and then audit my files, consolidate any duplicate markdown, and delete anything that was a one-time run or is not needed. I also have it create a prompt to send my Clawdbot with the consolidation summary. And as always, I ask my Clawdbot to repeat the memory back to me after the change so I know it's correct.

**################################**

**Cron Jobs and Sub-agents**  
Depending on what you are asking it to do, don't expect cron jobs to run well, unless you are using them to spawn an agent for a specific task that you have already set up. I had to spend a lot of time with trial-and-error to make sure that these ran smoothly. I have a morning brief that it creates for me (see use case below) and when trying to put it together in the heartbeat cron job (which it defaults to) it would timeout and fail most of the time.

For any routine tasks, tell it to create a sub-agent to run the task, and then the heartbeat cron just spawns the sub-agent to run the job so that you don't have to worry about timeouts. That one took me a long while and frustration to work out.

**################################**

**Security**  
This is the elephant in the room for a lot of people, and is a risk, but one that can be mitigated reasonably well. Clawdbot has a built-in security scan you can run, but some of the key ones for me are:

* Move your API keys to a .env file rather than the main config file
* Rotate your keys every 30 days
* Create a .gitignore file to stop sensitive files getting committed
* Use input validation for your email scripts so it can't send without your approval
* Rate limit your external API calls
* Encrypt your memory files (I am using Windows EFS because I am on Windows)
* Use Tailscale for remote access

**################################**

**Use Cases**  
What do I use my Clawdbot for? Here are some ideas and examples for other people.

***Email Scanning***  
It goes through my emails (6 accounts) every hour, filters out any marketing emails that are not important, or automated updates etc. and then summarizes the ones it thinks are important. It then drafts responses to those and sends it to me for approval, or has them saved in my Outlook drafts for anything I need to edit before sending.

***Task Monitoring***  
I use a fantastic project management/task management tool called Dart (www.dartai.com) which I have connected into my Clawdbot via API. This tool has multiple Project task boards and sub-boards for all of the various things that I work on. My Clawdbot helps manage these for me and gives me a briefing every day of what tasks are slipping and what isn't. If I am waiting on someone else before I can finish something? Clawdbot will add a tag for it and ignore it in the next summary etc. - you can really customize what it needs to do. Do I have a task from my Email Scanner? Clawdbot recognizes that from the email, and suggests moving it to the appropriate board.

***Morning Brief***  
This is where it really shines for me. It scans my Dart boards and gives me a summary of what tasks I have open. I have given it the schedule of what days I am where etc. so it will focus on those tasks for that day. It gives me local weather and a summary of news for things I am interested in, reminders for things on my calendar etc. and then sends it to me as a 3-5 minute audio file that I use ElevenLabs for. While I am making my morning coffee, my Clawdbot is getting me setup for the day.

***Link Scraping and CRM Management***  
I use the Apify scraper API, and Pipedrive CRM. I can ask my Clawdbot to search for specific things (i.e. all wedding venues in Seattle), it will use the Brave Search API to go and find company leads, then use Apify scraper to get contact information, and put it into Pipedrive CRM. You can also then get it to plan and implement email campaigns and automate follow-up etc. - I have used this is the real world, and after a little trial-and-error it is working surprisingly well.

***Basic Coding***  
If you want to vibecode an app or website, you're better off using a more purpose built tool. However, if you want it to do more basic stuff it does a pretty good job using DeepSeek to whip up prototypes or models etc. - I got it to build a basic personal health dashboard getting data from my Garmin Watch, my Withings Scales and my Oura Ring to create a consolidated dashboard for me of my overall health. I was pleasantly surprised at how well it put it together.

***Web Testing***  
Using the browser integration skill, as well as having it build custom Python scripts using Playwright, it does a pretty good job of UI and website testing, and produces good reports afterwards to isolate issues. A great use of time while you are sleeping!

***Constant Improvement***  
I have my Clawdbot scanning Moltbook, Moltcities, Reddit and other sites, referencing against my projects and making suggestions on how I can improve things twice a day.",39,1770324637.0,clawdbot,13,0.99,False

I want to preface this by saying it's not a sexual thing, and it's not something that gives me some form of sexual gratification, so before anyone starts getting pervy, it's not like that. 

I, 28M, have had an obsession with women and feminine people since I was a young adult/late teen. I love being in a relationship, just because that's the only time i can worship a woman and it not look suspicious or be frowned upon. It's the little things, getting her coffee, opening her door, doing her laundry, cooking, picking up her meds, making her bed, writing her little notes and doting on her, carrying her up stairs, etc. I'm a chauffeur, a servant, a caretaker and everything all in one.   
  
Last couple of years however, i've found that one woman just doesn't have enough needs to fill for me to feel satisfied. I want to praise and worship and offer any service i can to all women i meet. to compliment their beauty and brilliance and to do everything asked of me and more. My girlfriend has a friend who apparently she offered to share me with and i am trying to stifle my excitement but that's someone else i get to get coffee for and to cook for and to love on and hold and cherish and compliment. I'm obsessed with the notion that i can be there for these two gorgeous and powerful women and be let into their lives on such an emotional level.   
  
needless to say my love language is acts of service and words of affirmation and i'm just absolutely obsessed with giving as much love as i possibly can. Is something wrong with me? do i need help?

1qwx5k3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cafebrasil/comments/1qwx5k3/ajuda_para_preparar_um_bom_espresso/,Ajuda para preparar um bom espresso,"Tenho uma Philco 15 bar (sei que é setup de entrada) e já fiz alguns upgrades básicos: basket despressurizada (não possui indicador de dosagem), WDT, puck screen, tamper e nivelador (3D), e um moedor MHW 3Bomber Blade R3.
Sigo este guia de moagem para o R3: https://honestcoffeeguide.com/mhw-3bomber-blade-r3-grind-settings/ e gostaria de ficar entre 4 e 7–8 rotações para espresso, mas ainda não consegui chegar em um shot balanceado que caia ali nos 25–35 s para o tamanho indicado.

O que já tentei:
- 15–18 g, 1:2, em torno de tamanho 10 ou maior no moedor,  consigo algo perto de 30 s, mas o café fica ácido demais, com pouca doçura e pouco desenvolvimento de sabor. Já testei mexer na força do tamp, com/sem puck screen, pré-aquecer bem o porta-filtro (flush longo etc.). 

- Dose menor, ~13 g, moagem mais fina (por volta de 7)  e sai tipo 27 g em 2 min e meio. A acidez some, mas o café fica “apagado”, sem muito caráter.

Grãos usados: Especiais de mercado (tipo Coffee++) – até cheguei mais perto de algo bebível, mas sem corpo, o que imagino ser esperado pela falta de torra super fresca. Cafés de torra fresca (ex.: Ouro do Cerrado, Moca da Canastra, torra média) com resultado parecido: nunca chega num espresso que eu conseguiria chamar de “ok”, sempre ou muito ácido ou sem graça. 

Tenho quase certeza de que não é “eu não gosto de espresso”, porque em prensa francesa, coado e moka, com os mesmos grãos, eu tiro xícaras que gosto MUITO, com perfis que fazem sentido para mim. Então, imagino que deveria conseguir algo na mesma linha sensorial no espresso, só que mais intenso.

As the title suggests, I am looking for a good “do-it-in-this-order” walkthrough for the game. I am playing with three friends, and as the unofficial GM I am the one trying to point out what we should do next. This was easy enough for the first couple of labs, but I cannot figure out the proper order for the latter half of the game, after the Black Ant Lab.

Spoilers follow from here, so this is only directed at people who have already finished the story (or do not mind). From what I can tell from YouTube videos etc., it seems like the main story goes super fast from this point, consisting only of the Undershed and then the stuff around the coffee machine. After that, you can go back to being a normal teenager again. But if you do it like that, you miss out on several bosses, other labs, and so on!

The BL drama ""The Starry Night"" recently began filming, telling a story of emotional redemption spanning 10 years. The main couple is played by Han Chen and Luo Yijie, both averaging 190cm in height, and both are taking on the BL genre for the first time. Han Chen revealed that upon first seeing the script for the role of a street urchin, he exclaimed that he really wanted to play the part, while Luo Yijie's portrayal of a pianist was even more stunning.  
  
To cultivate chemistry, the two secretly arranged to ""date"" on the North Coast before filming, drinking coffee and talking to build their relationship. Han Chen laughed, saying that he discovered Luo Yijie was the type who ""keeps his suffering to himself,"" but after spending a lot of time together, they gradually opened up and discovered that they were both very sensitive. They even cried together in acting class, and their emotional connection quickly deepened.  
  
Han Chen comes from Eelin Model Agency and participated in the Taiwanese-Korean co-production talent show \*SCOOL\*; Luo Yijie comes from \*Atomic Boys\* and has experience in dramas and reality shows. The drama also features Zheng Ying, who plays a ""helper"" in developing the romantic storyline. Although her character has a crush on Luo Yijie, she admitted, ""Seeing someone I like not get a result also makes me sad.""  
  
Besides depicting the stirrings of youth, another highly anticipated romantic storyline is the ""elder brother and younger brother"" relationship, portrayed by veteran actors Zeng Shaozong and Chen Yanting. Zeng Shaozong's character, the elder brother, is caught between the pressures of the underworld and patriarchal authority, forced to suppress his true emotions and hide his deepest desires beneath a facade of rationality. He and Chen Yanting will portray this kind of lust that constantly tests the limits of danger.  
  
Lin Tingli, who is taking on the role of a ""gang leader's woman"" for the first time, said that she has mostly played daughters or students in the past. This time, from makeup to costumes, it was a completely new experience and a breakthrough. Tseng Shao-tsung also joked, ""When I saw her during the costume fitting, she was exactly like the character—sexy, feminine, and very seductive.""  
  
Furthermore, Chen Ju-shan humorously remarked during a scene where he's drunk and beating his son, ""The producer joked that I should beat him to death, but my son is 192cm tall, so I might end up getting beaten up by him."" Hsu Wei-tse, also from Eelin Entertainment, is taking on his first villainous role, constantly provoking Han Chen in the drama. He excitedly said, ""I already know Han Chen, so this is a rare opportunity to 'teach him a lesson,' and I'm really looking forward to playing a different kind of character."" Wu Chen-ya, who usually plays gangster roles, is transforming into a warm-hearted noodle shop owner this time, laughing, ""This time I won't be disliked; it's rare to play such a warm character."" The drama is expected to premiere in the fourth season of 2026.

1qwwrqy,https://atlanta.urbanize.city/post/piedmont-center-buckhead-cp-group-plans-elevated-gathering-space-unveiled,Piedmont Center set for transformation,"Cp Group recently purchased the property and is set to redo the office park with restaurants and retail upfront

Owners of Atlanta’s tallest skyrise and the former CNN Center have lifted the veil on the planned remake of a landmark business park near the heart of Buckhead.   

CP Group, a Boca Raton, Fla.-based commercial real estate and management firm with a massive Atlanta portfolio, revealed today a masterplan and rebrand that calls for transforming 2.2-million-square-foot Piedmont Center into a more inviting, “elevated communal gathering space” and destination for companies.

Spread across 46 acres, the 3525 Piedmont Road campus counts 14 office buildings, where more than 200 companies have a presence. Other upgrades in recent years have included 1.2 miles of walking trails and what previous owners described as “the fastest internet in Buckhead.”  

CP Group plans to kick off renovations this year and start infusing Piedmont Center with top-flight restaurants and retail amenities, per company leaders.  

For the general public, the most visible changes will see a new street-level retail and dining corridor built along Piedmont Road with at least six eateries and numerous, upscale retail offerings in a walkable setting, according to CP Group. 

Other upgrades are set to include event space, a new gateway entrance with wayfinding, a centralized amenity center that connects parking decks to sports courts, and “reimagined arrival experiences” and lobbies at Buildings 14 and 15, among other additions. CP Group is also planning to refashion 42,000 square feet of offices as spec suites around the property. 

CP Group has hired Atlanta-based architecture and design firms Smallwood and ASD|SKY, along with placemaking strategists Of Place, to help bring the masterplan vision to life.  
CP Group acquired Piedmont Center in June and announced plans to immediately start reimagining the office park. Across Atlanta’s three core submarkets, the company now controls more than 8 million square feet of space. Renovations at the company’s other trophy properties—Bank of America Plaza and The Center (formerly CNN Center)—are ongoing. 

Early changes at Piedmont Center have included the addition of LiveWire Coffee in Building 6 and food-truck programming on the property. 

The Ardent Companies, considered one of Buckhead’s largest office landlords, bought Piedmont Center five years ago and announced plans for a comprehensive remake called “Oxton” in early 2023. Those plans failed to materialize, and in June the Piedmont Center campus was sold in foreclosure for a $200 million credit bid on the Fulton County Courthouse steps. 

Since then, Piedmont Center has notched 77,000 square feet of leasing activity with existing and new tenants, including Buckhead Investment Partners’ expansion to 19,576 square feet and business management consulting firm ScottMadden’s lease renewal for 10,871 square feet, per CP Group. [UPDATE: 5:59 p.m., Jan. 29: Project reps send word 83,000 square feet of space has recently been leased, and not the amount they previously relayed.]

Stream Realty Partners has represented CP Group in all Piedmont Center leasing transactions. Available office leases remain available from small spaces to blocks of up to 92,000 and 140,000 square feet, per the leasing team. 

“We’re not just updating an office park; we’re building a destination,” Chris Eachus, CP Group founding partner, said in today’s announcement. “New restaurants and retail will anchor this project as a vital part of the Buckhead community.”",0,1770323727.0,Atlanta,1,0.5,False

I've seen a second hand DF64 Gen 2 with the upgraded SSP MP burrs for £300. I know I can get the df54 for about £100 less than the DF64, so is the extra cost worth it? I also know the 54 has a smaller footprint than the 64. I have a small kitchen (so 54 would fit better) but as far as I know, the footprint difference between the 54 and 64 isn't that much so depends which is the better grinder.



Where do the DF54/64 stand in comparison quality wise to the output I'd get from the C40?



Any help/advice wopuld be appreciated.

	Having a dilemma on what to really focus on. One being on what to write when it comes to  Ronald McDonald.  On the one hand, one story can be too…simplistic (if that’s the right word) or formulaic. Yet, the other story can seem pretentious, too dark or melodramatic. But, here are the abridged versions:

**Ronald And Rose Petal:**

	Set in the 80’s, The Professor of McDonaldland would fix out the bugs in the Adventure Machine. As a result, he, Ronald and the rest of the main gang (Sundae, Grimace, Birdie and Hamburglar) would be transported to a beautiful mansion known as “Rose Petal Place”. Not only that, they had shrunken to the size of insects.

	As they explore the luscious garden, they encounter the Flower Maids, including their leader, Rose Petal. Upon becoming acquainted with one another, Ronald’s and Rose Petal’s teams had to work together to foil the latest plans of the wicked Nastina. Once the day was saved, the McDonaldland gang had to head back home, but promised to visit Rose Petal Place whenever possible.

	The promise would be kept; producing many fun adventures. The old Rose Petal Place mansion would be explored,  Rose Petal and her pals would go to McDonaldland, and so much more! 

Over time, Ronald and Rose Petal became more than friends and fell in love. Though they’re happily married, their respective responsibilities have them in a long-distance relationship. After all, McDonaldland can’t run without Ronald and Rose Petal Place can’t run without Rose Petal (especially as her music keeps the garden alive). Then, after many years of marriage, they’d welcome their miracle child, Honey Rose (got the name from the honey-rose latte from McCafe: [首頁 - McDonald's](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/331999803788576447/) ).

**Ronald And Astraea:**

	This story involves much deeper lore set within a part of a 7-island Archipelago known as “Masco”. One of said islands, Trofi, holds the Burger Kingdom as well as McDonaldland. All with Trofi being ruled over by the royal Kyllini clan. Astraea (The Starbucks Siren) and Panera (of Panera Bread) are members of the family. 

	Now, to make a long story short; a young Ronald and Astraea meet on Siren’s Island (the domain of Astraea’s mother, Melusine), in the late 1960’s. The clown and his friends were castaways with Astraea being the sole citizen who had been living in seclusion for troubled reasons. And, unbeknownst to Ronald and company at the time, Astraea and Melusine are sirens but had to keep it secret from the public. Yet, during the stay, Ronald and Astraea had unearthed a crystal ball containing a seemingly innocent prisoner. Taking pity, the two set it free. In the end, Ronald and his pals return to McDonaldland but not without promising to exchange letters with Astraea.

	Fast forward to 1971 where Ronald and his gang meet Astraea again for the wedding of Kingsley (Ronald’s cousin and The Magic Burger King) and Panera. As romance blooms between the clown and the siren, trouble brews as Astraea’s parents become more dysfunctional. So much so that Astraea leaves for McDonaldand with Ronald. 

	Time goes on and, in 1945-1975, Ronald and Astraea tie the knot, themselves. Then in 1986, Melusine Kyllini passed away from a terminal illness. As a result, Astraea was crowned as the queen of Siren’s Island in 1987. With this new arrangement, Ronald and Astraea’s are forced to romance a long-distance relationship with letters, visitations and Ronald’s new “Picture Phone”. 

	In 1988, Astraea visited McDonaldlan, when Sundae, Grimace, Birdie, The Hamburglar and many other friends had disappeared during the night. Ronald tries to be optimistic in that it’ll be alright in the end. But, slowly, he and Astraea become terrorized by a being they thought was innocent. This entity would turn out to be Bathos; Ronald’s unknown uncle who used to work for Mercury-Dynamis (Astraea’s father) until Bathos and Allura (Melusine’s sister, Astraea’s aunt and mascot for Journey To Atlantis) had tried to murder Mercury-Dynamis. Allura fled punishment but Bathos was sealed away in the crystal ball. The very crystal ball Melusine took to guard when given Siren’s Island. All while Mercury-Dynamis enacted a damnatio-memorae on the corrupted clown. 

	In the end, Bathos is defeated, Ronald and Astraea are healed while their friends were set free. Then, in 2017,  Ronald and Astraea would finally become parents with the arrival of their daughter, Cherry (named after the berry the coffee beans come from), who would become mascot for McCafe.



What should I choose? Should I just drop it all completely? Any thoughts?

Arriving in San Juan around 2:30 pm. Renting a car to drive to our air BNB about 60 miles away. House with 5 star reviews. Above ground pool. Nice backyard with shaded area with loungers and bbq. Away from touristy area. Quiet neighborhood. Nearby beach but doesn't look that pretty. Willing to drive to get to nice beaches. Prefer soft sand, beautiful colored water, calm water. Large shallow areas where we can just sit or float a huge plus. We are average swimmers. Not super strong or fit. And while we don't feel elderly, somehow we are the same age as old people. Lol (61 and 70). We might do some snorkeling or snuba (if it's available) too chicken to do scuba. Other than that, we mostly want to relax on the beach. Places where we can easily use/rent umbrellas or cabanas or decent beach chairs are a plus as are reasonably clean bathrooms. Any recommendations?

Other than beaches, any other tips/recommendations/must see/hidden gems/things to avoid? We're willing to drive pretty much anywhere on the island. We will be there from Sat afternoon until Fri afternoon.

We like a relaxed pace. We are open to eating at the house and meals away, cooking or picking up food to eat at the house or outside. We aren't picky eaters. I just don't like super spicy. We love beaches, pools, and all things near or on the water (but we don't surf or scuba). We like nature. My husband loves great photo ops. Also we like artsy/quirky stuff, shopping. I like spas/beauty treatments. We also love coffee, regular and fancy concoctions. We don't usually drink alcohol, but love cocktails. We aren't very physically fit, so can't handle anything too intense. We can do stuff that's fairly easy. Can also handle some moderate physical stuff if you can take it slow, lots of breaks, or in small amounts.
We are semi adventurous in spirit, but not super adventurous.

The only plans we've made so far are to get some take out from a local coffee/sandwich place in San juan called cuatro sombras on our way to our air BNB on Sat and walking in the nature preserve in punta santiago on Sun morning.

So many issues with new machines and grinders not working so when I bought the sense, I was made up, great coffees no issues and grinder not broke (yet)

However, my main issue now is the flooding under the tray and the machine itself.
Ive seen advice saying its normal for the machine e to drip out into the tray when it's removed as a way of relieving excess pressure building, but the volume of water is ridiculous. If I forget for 2-3 days to empty the tray or check then im literally using a puppies training pad to soak up the water.

I just want to bounce this off of you, because I’m going crazy and can’t seem to get to a good solution.

We really like a particular Decaf. It’s more on the chocolatey side but very nice in a flat white if you just want to have a coffee in the evening. Since we liked it so much, we decided to order a 2kg batch and just threw that in the freezer.

Now here’s the kicker: For some reason, all the shots I pull from it now, are always horribly under extracted. We usually run 9 seconds of low flow as pre infusion on the Lelit Bianca and I’ve now tried every grind size resulting in total shot times (so including pre infusion) from 24-47 seconds.

The shorter times are quite obviously just under extracted. Like horribly so. Everything up to \~28s shot times is actually just salty. For the longer shots, I feel like I’m getting bad channeling and under extraction that way. They still have very clear saltiness in them and lack any sort of depth.

Now the next steps I am considering is just running a much longer pre infusion, grind even finer and see if I get a nice extraction without channeling that way, but honestly that would take away the convenience by having to reprogram the machine just for the decaf every day.

Puck prep is good, all of the other beans give us amazing espresso, so did the decaf in the past. I’m honestly considering now that something is wrong with the particular batch..

So yeah, any ideas? :D",1,1770322937.0,espresso,6,1.0,False
