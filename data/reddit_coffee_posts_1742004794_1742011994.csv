I think he really really likes me and we've gone on a few dates whether going out for coffee, watching a concert, or shopping trip. He's a really touchy person. His love language is holding hands and hugging but I have come to learn that I don't feel really great whenever he holds my hand. Hugging is somewhat ok. At the same time when I'm not with him I seem to be ok with it? 

I feel like I like the idea of him but I don't actually like his actual person? Every time before we go on a date, I have to do this mental preparation thing where I tell myself ok he might hold my hand today but it's ok we like that. And when I see him sometimes I have the urge of just hugging him, but as soon as he initiates some physical touch I'm just like nope. 

He's been respecting my boundaries but also every time I say no to him it hurts him a little bit? I don't really know...

1jbmlf7,https://www.reddit.com/r/MauiVisitors/comments/1jbmlf7/maui_trip_report_march_2025/,Maui Trip Report - March 2025,"Hi everyone! We just returned from an amazing 7 days in Maui. I feel like we had a great mix of relaxation and excursions, so I thought I’d share a glimpse into what we had on our itinerary. 

My mom was born and raised on the island of Oahu, so growing up most of our visits to Hawaii were to Honolulu to see family. We’ve visited Kauai and Big Island in the past, but Maui is probably my personal favorite island. It’s amazing to be back 

***Logistics****:* 

**Hotel**: Wailea Beach Resort Marriott 

**Flight**: Hawaiian Airlines 

**Rental car**: Jeep from Alamo

**Weather**: Perfect. Not humid at all, and the perfect blend of sun and clouds. There were some heavy tradewinds our first two days in the afternoons but it mellowed out the rest of the trip. It only rained while we were at Iao Valley but the was expected due to the elevation.

***Day 1 — Arrival Day*** 

Arrived in Maui at around 10:30am local time. We’re Marriott Bonvoy members so even though check-in is typically 4pm, I got the notification that our room was ready thanks to the pre-check in feature. We were starving after the flight so decided to stop by Foodland in Kahului near the airport to grab some poke for lunch and other essentials for the room.

Drove over to Wailea, checked-in. We last stayed at this resort about 6ish years ago so it’s been a bit since our last trip to Maui. It’s absolutely still up to Marriott standards and such a great property. We were in the Haleakala tower which was the best proximity to the lobby, beach path, and pools. We were in Hale 3(?) a few years ago and it was quite a walk to that building from the rest of the resort amenities. Definitely prefer the tower. Ocean view was great. Swam the rest of the afternoon. 

Walked across the street to The Shops at Wailea, got shave ice from Island Vintage, grabbed plate dinner from Island Gourmet Markets, brought it back to the hotel to eat and drink beer. 

***Day 2 — Kahului & Wailuku***

Started the morning early at Akamai Coffee. Line was out the door. I ordered the Hawaiian Honeybee and halved the Turkey Harvati Croissant sandwich. Would probably rate it a 7/10. I’m not a coffee conniseur by any means, but I think TikTok/social media hyped this place up a bit! I wasn’t really wowed. Definitely prefer Island Vintage Coffee at The Shops instead. 

Drove up to Kahului and went to the Maui Swap Meet. Smaller than the one on Oahu, way bigger than the one on Big Island. Spent about 3ish hours there going through all the vendors and the different things they had. A ton of fun and was so happy to support local businesses. 

Went to Geste Shrimp for lunch! Tons of food trucks in this little food garden. Geste was absolutely fantastic and true Hawaiian style shrimp. Ordered the Hawaiian Scampi combo plate with sausage. Probably my favorite thing I ate on this trip. 10/10! 

Drove over to Wailuku, stopped by Four Sisters Bakery about 15 minutes before they closed! Getting the famous butter rolls was on my must-dos for the trip. I recommend this place to everyone visiting maui. 10/10, absolutely delicious! 

Made the short drive over to Iao Valley state park! Perfect low-intensity hike and wonderful views. Weather up there is definitely a lot windier and wetter than Wailea, so dress accordingly. Spent about an hour and a half taking our time walking around, taking photos, and just enjoying the sights. 

Drove back to the resort, spent the rest of the afternoon in the pool. Was pretty swamped at the end of the day so we picked up a pizza from Andiamo’s, ate it on the balcony, and watched the sun set. 

***Day 3 — Maui Tropical Plantation*** 

Started morning with a sunrise walk on the Wailea Beach path. Looove this space between all the Wailea resorts. It’s beautiful views of the water and beach and the weather in the morning was totally ideal for the walk. 

Walked across the street to the shops to grab Island Vintage Coffee for breakfast. This is one of my favorite spots! Their original acai bowl is so fresh and sweet and their iced matcha latte has never failed me. Staff is great, service is quick, and seating is ample since it’s basically the only thing open in the entire shopping center at that time. 

Today’s main excursion was Maui Tropical Plantation! We did the farm tour. It was really interesting and our tour guide had an obvious passion for the Hawaiian ecosystem, culture, farming, etc. However due to the time of the year most of the crops weren’t really “bloomed” yet? If that makes sense, lol. Like the trees were bare and there weren’t any like visible fruits or plants, etc. The coconut husking demo was pretty fun. 

We grabbed lunch at Cafe O’Lei! We made the reservations beforehand. Food was about a 8/10, but ambiance an easy 10/10. 

Headed back to the hotel and surprise — spent the afternoon at the beach. Dinner was chill that night, picked up food from Island Gourmet Market and hung out around the resort. 

***Day 4 — Relax***

Sunrise walk on the Wailea beach path. Grabbed breakfast from the buffet at the hotel. Loved the offerings and free mimosa. We had pre-booked a spa appointment a few months before our arrival so we did that shortly after breakfast. I did the signature facial and it was such a relaxing and wonderful experience!  

Didn’t do much this day, lol. Mainly just went for a swim at the beach, soaked up the sun,  hung out at the resort. Marriott also offers Hawaiian culture classes/demonstrations so we participated in the Lei making class. 

For dinner, we went to Monkeypod! The hype around this place is totally deserved. I ordered the lobster pizza and it was delicious. Their Mai Tai’s are top notch. One of my favorite spots on Maui for sure. 

***Day 5 — Kihei*** 

Did our usual morning walk, then drove out to Kihei to eat at Kihei Caffe. Spent most of the morning at Charley Young beach. Around lunch, grabbed poke from Foodland then drove back down to Wailea. Hung out at the pool, then hung out at the bar, then went u to the room to get ready for dinner. 

Drove back up to Kihei to try Misophat for dinner. Would absolutely recommend!

***Day 6 — Relax***

Our last full day! Started off the morning slow and relaxing. Walked the entirety of the Wailea beach path, then spent some time sitting on the beach and watching the waves roll in. We headed back up to the hotel and did the breakfast buffet again. After breakfast, went down to the infinity pool and spent most of the day swimming and relaxing. 

Our last dinner was at Spago over at the Four Seasons! We took the resort shuttle and they dropped us off. We were a bit early for our reservation so we had some time to walk around the resort. We’re Marriott loyalists so I don’t know if I’ll ever come around to staying at the Four Seasons, but it’s a great resort. Had tons of fun pointing out spots that they filmed the White Lotus season 1 in lol. 

Dinner was absolutely fantastic. We love Spago and have been in the past. It’s truly fine dining and the staff went above and beyond to make it an awesome experience. Food was wonderful and it was great being able to watch the sunset from the terrace! 

***Day 7 — Travel day***

Travel day! Luckily our flight wasn’t too early in the morning. We grabbed our final coffees from Island Vintage Coffee, then walked back to the hotel to gather our things and checked out. Drove back up to Kahului, ate at Zippy’s, then went to Costco to fill up the tank. Dropped off the car at Alamo and was at the airport shortly after. 

Had an early afternoon flight and returned back home! Missing Hawaii already. Mahalo for reading, everyone! ",3,1742010847.0,MauiVisitors,0,1.0,False

John and Jade during a [Facebook live](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/18EEoENjgX/?mibextid=wwXIfr) decided they were going to go protest at the Northampton County Courthouse, go then early in the morning, and wait for it to open. They asked people to come and they did. People showed up with signs and flyers. In the[ last live](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1Dn9ETDVa9/?mibextid=wwXIfr), they played Billie Eilish out of a car speaker. Jade was tearful and pleading for help in Aubrey’s return, asking where is she, begging for her to return. You can see several cars honk and everyone goes “woo!” They got donuts and coffee for everyone. 

Attorney Ally also came. In [this live](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/16GUuucBvz/?mibextid=wwXIfr) (at 2:33) Jade said “*Our lawyer, Ally, we are in the live. We need answers. I can’t take this bullshit anymore.*”

Attorney Ally: “*I know, I know. Why do you think I’m here? I showed up. After I woke up to a hundred messages. So here I am.*”

Jade: “*Thank you. We need you.*”

Ally: “*You’re welcome. I’m here.*” 

Jade: “*Today is the day we need to be united and show what is United States and what is justice. You’re going to answer for fucking kidnapping, kidnapping.*” 

John and Ally exchange looks. John said Jade’s been “going all morning.” He tells Jade she shouldn’t record the conversation him and Ally are having. More showing the scene, pleading for help with Aubrey. 

According to several comments made on reddit of those who passed by or knew of someone passing by state that their experience was people would jump in front of their car in the street to try to stop them from passing by so they could take a flyer. 

# Tonight: 

[John’s Live at 8PM](https://www.facebook.com/john.gehrmann.50/videos/1129153828990404?idorvanity=2007491949732943) and what he said (long summary):

Thanks to those who showed up. They have been up for around 30 hours. Upset about local media stories. Upset that DA used the term “temporary housing” for FF. They’ve been reading descriptions online of Aubrey’s “mental state” that was upsetting them and they had “never heard about it” which prompted them to go to protest in the middle of the night at Northampton County Courthouse. “*Earliest starting protest hopefully in the history of Northampton County.*” Jade, John, and Attorney Ally met with someone else (not DA) who is offering help to them. **They will have a meeting with this person and the FBI on Monday at 1PM. He asks no one else shows up on Monday.** They are looking to be respectful and share information. They heard things for the first time from this individual that they allege Palmer PD has withheld from them. They will deal with Palmer withholding that another time. 

This evening they will be filming with a local production company in Easton working pro-bono. They will possibly be doing tiktoks and lives tonight as well. They will likely not be online much this weekend because they need to work on packaging evidence, findings, and stories to present for their Monday meeting. 

Talked about why Jade doesn’t typically talk in comparison to John (referencing lives earlier from the day of her crying, pleading for help with Aubrey, outside the courthouse). Compliments his wife on how courageous she is. 

Acknowledges he has been charged with 3 counts of harassment, but they are from weeks ago (Feb. 26). “*And when you threaten the family of somebody, I’m not gonna admit guilt or innocence*” then talks about a video that was filmed in the parking lot of a flyer event that got taken out of context and he doesn't know what was said (presumably the Lowe’s video). Mentions FF’s full name. Goes into all the allegations. Upset again that it is being called “temporary housing” by DA because they ""never gave permission"" for Aubrey to be there. Wants to start talking more about FF’s husband, TF. “*...left me with a certain feeling of retribution for this individual who cause Jade and I so much direct pain. And if there is a singular person who is responsible right now for why Aubrey Wu is not in our home in Palmer Pennsylvania, it’s this woman by far. Second only to AW who calls in a fugues welfare check on Friday at 6:40 pm and then allegedly has our daughter right in front of her saturday at 8PM and in her own words with a* disheveled *woman she did not know. And she pushed our daughter into the car. Guys this is beyond* ridiculous *okay. Those are facts.*” 

Hoping to address during the Monday meeting the “establishment of facts” and hopes that the individual and FBI align with them. There’s conversation in the country about “fake truth or fake fact.” “*Everything we are aware of is just this woman’s story. It’s just her lending a narrative that I'm incredibly stunned given her bizarre decisions and as far as PA statue is concerned, kidnapping, this is not something we are going to get quiet about.*” He is going to watch his language though. Wants viewers to ask themselves why FF and AW’s names are not being covered in the media and that they should not be awarded protection. *“Those are the two human beings who failed Aubrey Wu the most on the last day anybody has come forward and said they had contact with that young girl. Are you aware of that folks? There is nobody starting Jan. 12 to today, March whatever it is. 9 weeks. There is not a single human that has stepped forward and said I interacted with Aubrey Wu. And that has us Jade and I terrified. Shooken to our core and we are not going to stop.""* Talks about a man and him having a conversation on a live yesterday and saying it has nothing to do with the charges. It is FF.

Talks about how he knows the story is complicated, there’s been doxxing, they’re not quiet enough, he doesn’t care. It’s about Aubrey. “*If you want to know the truth, we’re happy to tell it to you.*” Wanting to keep the public informed because he believes police want people to move on from the story. 

Said he found out there are 5 other families in Easton who do not have their teenage daughters home and that is a “*criminal failure of the system of the protect and serve people of our community not doing either.*” Believes institution failures are costing children ""*their lives"", ""their youth""*. He and Jade want to continue advocating for this long after “*this is resolved.*”

Felt it was beautiful that people came, cars honking, so many people already knew her, so many people became informed, people saying her name. Lawyers in the courthouse came up to them to tell them “*keep making noise.*” One lawyer said “*The squeaky wheel gets it. Be squeaky. Be very very squeaky*” and thats what they’re going to do. 

Aubrey is “*all energy all the time*,” “*bubbly*,” “*and she just disappeared*.” “*She loves her mom, she loves me*.” Talks about how much fun they have together being “regular” at home playing board games, snacking, watching movies, playing uno, having fun. “*Do we argue? Sure, of course. Who doesn’t? But we talk things through. This isn’t a house of violence or explosive things like that. And we miss Aubrey a lot.”*

***“and Aubrey, somehow if this video makes it way to you kiddo i hope you are tuning in cause you can google your name, your moms name, my name, and there’s a lot of information out there and we hope it catches up to ya. We’re not gonna give up. We don’t believe this bull narrative about what’s being told about you. We know you better than that.*** They can’t lie to us. They can lie to the media. They can incorrectly tell stories, thats fine. Thats what they do, right? Thats what they do. Now she was at temporary housing. Do you see how hard the DA is working to not use the word kidnapping? Because that's what the kid was doing at her temporary housing, she was napping right? Kid napping. Give me a gooddamn break here people.” 

Going to take days for the production company to get things together. They’re honored they would help them make this video about Aubrey. Thanks everybody for the meals, cards, flyers, banners, signs. He hopes he thanked everyone and apologizes to those he wasn’t able to. “*I know weeks ago I was on here screaming saying we need your help, stand up, this and that. You have. Thank you so much. Thank you thank you thank you.”*",3,1742009944.0,EnciAubreyWu,6,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1jbm8i5,https://www.reddit.com/r/energydrinks/comments/1jbm8i5/fav_energy_drinkway_to_consume_caffeine/,Fav energy drink/way to consume caffeine?,"Hey guys so I’ve been an avid caffeine addict since I’ve been an adult in the workforce. I usually drink multiple 300mg energy drinks through out the day and I have to say my personal favorite is the strawberry delish by Bang. The price of 10$ a day has me wondering if I could be doing it better however. I recently got a 4 cup French press and I’ve been brewing a whole pot worth of coffee in it and that seems to be the cheapest route I can go. Aldis columbian is godly lol. I’ve tried buck up powder and g-fuel and gamer sups etc but the only flavor I can handle multiple times a day/daily without getting tired of it is coffee flavor. I’ve been plotting to just buy anhydrous caffeine powder and making my own but I’m not entirely sure if that would even be cheaper. 

On the topic of anhydrous caffeine, has anyone tried that “Blow” powder energy? I see it all over tik tok and stuff but don’t really trust tik tok lol. I’ve never been a fan of the thing they’re trying to mimic so I was curious how close it was to it because, ew the taste and numbness is no bueno lol. ",2,1742009404.0,energydrinks,2,1.0,False
1jbm7xz,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1jbm7xz/office_party_professional_discomfort/,Office Party: Professional Discomfort,"Lawrence had gone through the usual crimes of his morning routine. Barely wake up to his alarm, slowly make himself a pot of coffee, and then suddenly do everything else at a breakneck pace so he wasn’t late for work. On a normal day this would all take place in his modest, one bedroom apartment, but today Lawrence had to drive into work, making the furious rush of getting ready at least twice as fast as usual. He barely looked when grabbing an outfit, neglected a shower, and practically dove into his car. He drove at speeds down the highway that would give NASCAR racers a heart attack, and finally made it into the office over an hour away from his home right on time. Lawrence was much too accustomed to working from home, so this trip was not a pleasant one for him. *All I have to do is smile and pretend I’m having a good time,* he thought to himself, *and then they’ll think I’m the best and I can go home. Maybe I can even convince my boss that working from home is better for my productivity.*

The office had all the trappings of a typical corporate landscape. The walls were pristine white plaster, light blue carpet flooring, and there were a few uninspired motivational posters on the wall mixed with company policy. The space was littered with people in professional outfits and the occasional worker sat in a rare chair as they engaged in forced socialization. Lawrence didn’t need to be a mind reader to know no one wanted to be here. The office was pretty quiet for a party. There was one man, however, that stood out like a sore thumb, laughing and joking with a few other workers like he was having the time of his life. He was tall and obnoxiously muscular, and the second Lawrence saw him and he was immediately jealous of his imposing stature and positive attitude. Lawrence sighed. *As long as I don’t have to talk to loudmouth over there, I think I’ll skate by this party just fine.*

As if the man had read Lawrence’s mind, he turned and noticed that Lawrence was a new face in the crowd. The man abruptly ended his conversation with another coworker saying, “Hey! You’re the new guy, right? The name’s David.” *And here we go,* Lawrence thought.

David walked about halfway across the room with his arm stretched outwards with the threat of a handshake. Lawrence, much shorter than him, had to look up slightly to meet his gaze.

“Hello. I’m Lawrence, but my friends call me Larry.” Lawrence extended his hand, and David took it in his grasp tightly. *Well he’s got quite a grip,* Lawrence thought. David held on to the grip just slightly longer than Lawrence would have liked, and continued their conversation. “Well Larry, it's nice to meet you. You are new, right? Or are you just not a big party guy?” 

Lawrence forced an awkward laugh. “Well, it’s a bit of both, honestly.” *I don’t even like going to the grocery store half the time, so no, not my cup of tea.* Lawrence thought. If Lawrence was more courageous, he might have just said this, but he had a reputation to uphold.

“Well that’s alright Larry, you’ll warm up to us eventually. Have you met everyone else yet or am I your first?” David laughed heartily and loud, and a smile crept across his masculine features.

*Was that a joke?* Lawrence spit out another awkward laugh. “You’re uh- my first, I guess. I just got here maybe ten minutes ago.”

“Oh!” David exclaimed. “Well, you’ve got to meet everybody. You know they say all that bullshit about your ‘job family’ or whatever but everyone here is pretty great. I mean for the most part anyway. Dean is a rat bastard.” 

“Right, Dean?!” David shouted across the small office space to a man dressed in a dark, obviously expensive suit that highlighted his dark hair and boyishly handsome features. Dean leaned on the water cooler, took a sip from his freshly poured tap water and said, “Whatever you say David.” Dean turned away from them and continued his conversation with another coworker.

“See? He knows.” David laughed again, his large chest barely contained by the tight polo shirt he wore.

Lawrence barely masked his nervousness with a single, weak laugh. *Maybe he’s not so bad. He’s just trying to be nice.* Lawrence thought.

“So new guy- Larry- what is it you do here? You’re not the new janitor, are you? Pedro would be pissed if you took his job- he’d have to go back to the tomato farm down south!” 

David chuckled to himself. This time, Lawrence did not reciprocate, looking down uncomfortably at the floor before answering his question. *I gave him the benefit of the doubt, and he gave me a racist joke. Nice.*

Still, he continued the conversation. “I’m in accounting,” he said, “I handle a few large clients, and right now I’m working with the Anderson family on the purchase of a fourth house. I think it’s a wildly reckless way to spend money but hey, it’s what they want.”

“Hmm, that’s weird. I’m also in accounting. Is this literally your first day? Lucky guy, uh? First day is the work party.”

Lawrence stiffened a bit. “No, I’ve been with the company for about two weeks, I just work from home.”

“Ohh well that explains it. They made you come here huh? Couldn’t be walled up inside forever?” David finished his sentence with a firm slap on Lawrence’s shoulder. The impact nearly knocked him over.

*I wish he would keep his hands to himself.* Lawrence pushed up his glasses. “Well yeah, I guess they’re moving away from remote work. Kinda sucks because that’s half the reason I took this job. The office building is far away from my house and-”

“Boy it’s hot in here, huh?” David interrupted. “Sorry I was listening, I just couldn’t get over this heat. I know it’s like ninety degrees out but you’d think corporate would be able to get some AC in here. I think we make enough money for some AC.”

“Yeah I guess it is pretty hot in here.” Lawrence said. *What an asshole.* He thought.

“So you’ll be coming into the office then? We’ll be work pals! Of course, we’ll be busy but maybe one of these days I’ll buy you a drink and I’ll tell you about my… college days.” David’s thick brown eyebrows lifted up as he said this.

“Sure.” Lawrence said. “Maybe.”

“Well, I’ll uh- see you around. But it really was nice meeting you.” David pointed at Lawrence. “And don’t be shy, nobody’ll bite. Except for maybe Samantha, she can be pretty nasty.” David leaned in a bit. “But you know if Sam’s biting you maybe that ain’t so bad.” David laughed, slapped Lawrence on the shoulder again and walked away. He shouted towards the water cooler, “Dean, don’t you got work to do or something?”

	David walked towards the water cooler and the female coworker Dean was chatting with quickly walked away. Dean looked up at David with a look that mingled disinterest and annoyance. David loudly chatted with him, Lawrence picking up the occasional word or two even though the two men were on the other side of the office.

The room the party was held in was large, but people were crammed in, standing just shy of shoulder-to-shoulder. In fact, the only uncrowded spaces seemed to be around the food, the water cooler, and, strangely enough, around Lawrence. 

*People don’t really want to talk with me.* he thought. *Or maybe they’re just shy. That’s alright, I didn’t want to talk with anyone anyway.* Then something alarmed him. *Did I put on deodorant today? God, I hope I did. That would be a nightmare.*

Lawrence looked around to make sure no one was looking in his direction and took a whiff of his underarms. *All good.* he thought. *Well, that’s a relief.*

“What are you doing?” A feminine voice from behind Lawrence accused.

Lawrence jumped nearly a foot into the air. He nervously fiddled with a pen he was holding and turned to face the woman. She was stunning to him. Piercing green eyes, slim figure, and dark hair that was tied up into a tight bun. Even though she was dressed in a very professional pan suit, her feminine features could not be ignored. 

“Oh, I- uh, had spilled some coffee on myself earlier and I just wanted to make sure I didn’t smell too much like it.” That was the best he could come up with.

She raised one eyebrow. “You spilled the coffee on your armpits?”

He felt immensely pressured by her words. *What the hell do you want me to say? I wanted to make sure I didn’t stink?*

“Well- uh- yeah! I was carrying some important papers for the Anderson file earlier today and I kind of held the cup between my arm and body to make sure I didn’t spill it. I almost got it too, but then as I was putting the paperwork down I kind of spilled the coffee on myself. Luckily nothing got on the papers.” *Nailed it!*

“Uh huh, sure.” she said with heavy doubt in her voice.

Lawrence struggled to find a way further on or out of the conversation naturally. *She came over here, didn’t introduce herself, and then caught me doing something embarrassing. This is why I work from home.* He sighed. “I’m Larry by the way.” He extended his hand. “Samantha.” she said. She barely touched his hand as the two shared a handshake. He figured that if he was stuck here, he might as well try to have a conversation with the beautiful woman standing in front of him.

“So you’re in accounting too, right? What do you think of the firm?” Lawrence asked.

Her reply was very short. “It’s work.”

There was a long, awkward pause. He continued, “So is there anything I should know about the place? I’m going to be working in the office soon and any advice you could give me would be great.”

She looked at him for a moment and pondered his question. “I don’t really have any advice for you. It’s just like any other accounting gig.”

He did not understand why she had even started a conversation to begin with. *David was right, she really is kind of nasty,* Lawrence thought. Foolishly pulled by his attraction to her, Lawrence continued to attempt to breathe life into the small talk.

“So-uh- what do you do for fun? Like, when you’re not working?” he asked. She gave him a brief side eye, looked him up and down barely attempting to hide her disgust for the short pathetic balding man in front of her. “My girlfriend and I go to gay bars. *Lots* of gay bars.”

The word ‘girlfriend’ stung a bit for Lawrence. Not because of any controversial opinions, but because he was hoping that despite her abrasive attitude, he might be able to see a different side of her. He combed back his partially balding hairline, put the pen he was playing with in his pocket and somewhat dejectly said, “Yeah, I have a few gay friends, those bars are pretty fun.” 

She looked at him and said, “Oh, you’re gay?” He immediately turned bright red. “No!” he stammered quickly, “I was just being supportive!”

She giggled to herself and said, “I’m sure your gay buddies need lots of support Larry, I get it. I *support* a ton of my gay friends too, don’t worry about it! Maybe I’ll see you at the next pride parade.”

 Just as Lawrence was going to respond (most likely something poorly thought out, borderline homophobic and childish), Samantha said, “You wanted advice, right? Just keep to yourself and you’ll be fine. Manage your accounts well. And if you don’t want to deal with office politics, then I probably wouldn’t tell David what you just told me. He’s got a lot of opinions.” Immediately after saying this she noticed someone had brought out champagne at the drink table. She practically ran towards the table away from him, not even saying goodbye. Passive-aggressively Lawrence half-shouted at her, “Okay, well, it was nice to meet you!” 

He sighed to himself. *Wow, what a bitch.* 

Suddenly Lawrence was wrapped in the muscular grip of David’s forearm. “Larry, come on, you’ve got to meet Dean.” David basically dragged Lawrence back over the water cooler. Dean was still standing in the exact place he had been this entire party, now glued to his phone. He looked up uninterested as David and Lawrence drew closer. 

Lawrence had enough of the office torture, and he certainly didn’t want to be yanked across the room. “Get off me, man! You can’t just drag me around like that!” A few people in the office turned to face them. Immediately, embarrassment filled Lawrence, his face turning a deep red. 

“Geez man, I was just trying to be friendly and introduce you.” David said. Without looking up from his phone Dean replied, “Yeah, you don’t have to shout.”

“Sorry,” Lawrence whimpered, “I’m not a very physical guy. I don’t like being touched.”

David backed up a bit from Lawrence. “I can see that, buddy. I’ll keep off.” While Lawrence was still wracked by embarrassment, David and Dean shared a judgmental glance.

David cleared his throat. “Well anyway, Dean, Larry. Larry, Dean.” Lawrence looked up and extended his arm towards Dean. It hung there for a while and Dean said, “I thought you didn’t like being touched?” Lawrence’s heart pounded in his chest. “Oh, uh, yeah.” He slowly lowered his arm to his side. “And uh my name is Lawrence. Larry is just kind of a nickname.” David looked down at Lawrence. “But your friends call you Larry, right?” Lawrence looked at the two men, and said, “Oh yeah- I mean I just wanted to give you options you know?” Lawrence laughed nervously. Dean finally tore his eyes up from the phone screen and looked Lawrence up and down. He said, “Alright, *Lawrence,* thank you for the options.”

A long pause mingled with minor tension held in the air for a moment. Then David broke the silence. “Well Dean and I were just going over our stock portfolios. Personal of course. I was wondering if you had any passive income or anything like that. Dean here is practically a wizard when it comes to that stuff, he trades bitcoin and everything!” Dean looked up and said with the slightest bit of enthusiasm, “Yeah I’ve made a good chunk of change doing that. I sort of just do this job so I don’t get bored. I’ve been thinking about putting out my own memecoin. The market is super volatile but there’s money to be made if you get in quickly enough.”

*What the hell is a memecoin?* Lawrence wondered. He didn’t want to embarrass himself any further though so he figured it’d be best to fake it until he could escape this interaction. “Well a few years back I did acquire some rental properties, but I ended up selling them because it was too much of a hassle.” Lawrence stood a little more confidently now, assured that this lie would carry him well in this conversation. “Oh yeah?” Dean asked, “When’d you buy the properties? And where? I’ve always wanted to get into that market but I didn’t really know where to break in.”

*Alright, details now,* Lawrence thought, *just come up with a random date.* “I think it was around December 2007? And it was just around here, a small place on Central street and another property in the cul de sac on the north end of town.” Dean and David’s eyes grew wide. They shared a surprised glance. Dean spoke up, “December 2007? You mean right before the housing market crash?!” Now Lawrence’s eyes grew wide. He had trouble speaking. “Uh-yes, yeah. It was rough. Lost everything. A hassle, like I said.” Dean broke out into laughter. “Lawrence, buddy, you are in the wrong line of work. I wouldn’t trust you with a piggy bank.”

Lawrence began to defend himself and his stupid lie. “Well that was before I got into the business! Plus, accounting and rental management are two very different fields.” Dean was still softly chuckling as Lawrence said this, and David was failing to suppress a wide grin. “Just don’t tell your clients and you’ll be just fine Lawrence.” Dean said. “Yeah, what they don’t know can’t hurt ‘em.” David added.

Lawrence already didn’t want to be in this conversation, and now the urge to leave had overwhelmed him. “Well, I’m feeling awful thirsty. I think I’ll grab some of that champagne.” Lawrence said. As he began to turn towards the drink table, David said, “You know, you should just do what I do before one of these things. Two shots of bourbon. Keeps your head clear, but enough to still have some fun.” Lawrence stopped and shot David a look. “What? You drank bourbon and then drove here?” David rolled his eyes. “It’s two shots. It’s not like I’m downing the whole thing. Larry, man, you need to lighten up a little.” *He’s drinking and driving and I need to lighten up!* *Next this guy is gonna tell me he’s doing lines off the toilet seats and I’m a prude for not joining him.* Lawrence did his best to ignore David’s last comment and headed towards the food and drink table.

Lawrence was nearly shaking with rage now. He needed that drink and fast. *Jesus, why do I have to be here? A mandatory office party is ridiculous.* After a bit of waiting in line, he grabbed two slices of pepperoni pizza and a very small glass of champagne. He immediately downed what little drink he had, and began to work on the two pizza slices.

As Lawrence was tearing into his final slice, it slipped off his plate, directly onto his white dress shirt, and slid over his light blue tie before slumping off him onto the ground. *Oh my god,* he thought. *I’ve got to clean this up now. Of course! Today just keeps getting better!* Looked around again, hoveled over in a pathetic attempt to hide the giant stain covering his entire front. *No no no no no. Where’s the bathroom?* He hadn’t seen any when he had come in. He frantically looked around but still couldn’t find one. The only way out was, of course, blocked by Samantha and a few other female coworkers. *I’ll just do my best to slip past them and find the bathroom. They probably will know exactly why I’m leaving and keep that to themselves. I don’t think Samantha really wants anything to do with me anyways.*

As he walked over to the door in a hunched over position, he overheard a bit of their conversation. “Really?” one of the other girls asked Samantha, “he was smelling himself?” Samantha laughed. “Yeah, I mean I was just going to keep my distance but I couldn’t help myself. I thought it’d be kind of funny, you know? But then he gave me those like ‘I’m into you’ vibes and it stopped being fun. I turned it around though. You know what’s a great way to get any guy to leave you alone? Call them gay. They’ll be so emasculated they won’t even know how to react.” The three women all laughed like they were on the set on Mean Girls, and one of them said to Samantha, “You’re so crazy Sam.”

“Excuse me. I’ve gotta get through the door.” He quietly asked them. The women all turned to face him, turning a bit pale. Lawrence was shaking with anger and embarrassment. He was moments away from crashing out right there. She looked at him, saw the massive stain on his shirt, and said, “Oh yeah no problem, Larry.” She and her colleagues moved out of the way. “You weren’t kidding about the coffee, huh? You’ve got a talent for spilling things.” She smirked at him, and he instantly lost any remaining attraction to her. *If I wasn’t so embarrassed I’d have a rebuttal.* He thought. Then he ashamedly dashed through the door to find the bathroom.

It took Lawrence a few minutes, but he did eventually find the bathroom. He cleaned up the shirt as best as he could, took off his tie, and got ready to return to the party. He waited in the bathroom for a long time just hoping he could dry the large wet circle that made his white shirt nearly see through, but it was no use. *I wonder if I could just wait out the whole party here until it's over.* he thought. He slowly left the bathroom and walked with shoulders slumped back towards the office.

For a while Lawrence did his best to avoid conversation. He would be on his phone, circle the room in the opposite direction to wherever David was, and whenever he would be asked anything personal, he would give the blandest one note answers in hopes that his verbal assailant would leave him alone in boredom. That worked for about an hour, until his boss arrived.

*Oh my god, it’s Amanda!* he thought. *She’ll let me out of here.*

Lawrence walked towards the short, heavy set asian woman who despite her stature, held a lot of composure. When she walked into the room, it was clear to everyone that she was the boss.

“Hey Amanda! It’s Larry! How are you?” Lawrence put on a huge fake smile as he said this and tried his best to pretend like he was enjoying himself.

“Oh hi Larry, it’s good to see you. I’m doing fine, thank you for asking.” Amanda said. “I’m so glad you’re going to be with us at the office now. I’m sure you’ll be a great addition to the in-house team. How’s the party been? Did you like the pizza?”

Her corporate attitude and tone nearly destroyed his facade of joy. He always hated when higher-ups gave off an over professional persona. Lawrence also very much did not want to stop working from home. His resolve remained strong though, and he continued towards his goal. “Yeah, the party is great, pizza top-notch. But you know I’ve just got this pounding headache, and I think my time here would be better spent working on the Anderson file.”

She began sifting through her purse. “Oh you’ve got a headache? No worries, I've got some pain meds that’ll fix you up.” She found the pills and handed them to Lawrence. “Oh uh- thank you.” he stammered. Amanda continued, “And if you still have work to do on the Anderson file you should have plenty of time to do that Monday. Come on, let’s head to the water cooler so you can wash down those pills.” *The water cooler?!* he thought. He looked over and saw David and Dean, still over there chatting loudly. *I think I would rather die.* Lawrence took the two large pills and immediately swallowed them, choking a little bit before they went down. Amanda looked at him in shock. He coughed and said, “I’m more of a dry pill guy. I get worried that some of the water will dissolve the pill before I actually get it in my system.” He laughed awkwardly and she stared at him for a few seconds longer, then noticed the giant wet spot on his shirt. 

“What happened to your shirt Larry?” she asked. He rubbed the back of his head. He had given up on lying at this point. “I spilled some pizza on myself. Had to go to the bathroom and clean it up.” She clearly looked disappointed but stifled it and continued the conversation.

“Ah. Well it’s a little embarrassing but I’m sure no one will notice when you give your welcome speech.” She began walking towards the food and drink table, eyeing the remaining slices of veggie pizza. *Welcome speech?!* Lawrence thought. He hurried behind her as she strode towards the table. “Um, welcome speech? What do you mean by a welcome speech?” he asked. She picked up a plate loaded with some pizza and looked at Lawrence. “Your welcome speech, Larry. I sent an email along with your onboarding paperwork. Everyone here does one. It doesn’t have to be incredible, you’re just introducing yourself. Do you not read my emails?” Her tone became accusatory. She drove a stare into Lawrence while tearing into her pizza. He anxiously responded, “No, of course I remember that! I just thought it’d be when I actually joined the team, not at the party.” 

With her mouth full of food she said, “Well if you had read the email you’d know it was today, Larry.” *Oh my god.* He thought. *This is the worst day of my life.* “Well I mean, a speech is sort of silly don’t you think? I mean we can sideline the corporate stuff just this once, can’t we? I mean whose bright idea was it anyway to make someone new give a speech?” he pleaded. Amanda threw away her now empty plate, wiped her hands on a paper towel and gave Lawrence a stern look. “It wasn’t corporate’s idea, it was mine.” she said. Lawrence turned ghostly pale. “And Larry we negotiated nearly six figures. That’s much higher than the national average for accounting, you know. If you can’t put together a simple speech, then we may need to talk about your future in this company.”

*I’m going to be fired over an office introduction.* “No, that’s alright Amanda. You’re right, I’ll do the speech.” he said, defeated. “Oh good,” she said, “that’s why I came in here anyway. I’ll gather everyone up now and you can go ahead and start.”

*Right now?! I didn’t have time to write anything, not even five minutes!* Lawrence suddenly had the urge to run away. *I’ll just dash out the door and not come back! I’ll start a new career!* The more Lawrence thought about it though, the more reality crept in. Amanda was already getting things ready for him to speak. It was too late now.

Amanda gathered the crowd’s attention very quickly. She positioned Lawrence at the center of the room and began to introduce him. “Alright everyone,” she announced, “we have a new team member today. He’ll say a few words, and then everyone will be free to go if they wish. If anyone is sticking around afterwards, the office will close at five.” She backed up and ushered Lawrence forwards. He stood nervously in the center of the room, small beads of sweat forming on his forehead. He was shaking slightly.

*There has to be twenty five, maybe thirty people staring at me.* He was right, the whole room was staring, waiting for what he had to say. He imagined many outcomes, but torches and pitchforks were a consistent theme across all of them. He took a deep breath. “Hello everyone, my name is Larry, and I’m excited to be working here.” This was, of course, a lie. Lawrence was usually a terrible liar, but these words held a bit of weight to them. He said it as if he desperately wanted to believe it himself. If this was going to be a decent speech, he needed to inject some truth into it. “To be honest with you, I was very nervous to speak in front of all of you. I still am. But after talking with a few of you and getting a sense of the environment I think I’ll warm up eventually.” *I think I’d have to get a lobotomy before I enjoy the company of the people I’ve met so far.* He thought. Despite his internal turmoil, the crowd seemed convinced. He faked a smile. “And I'm a big reader, so if anyone has a suggestion, let me know.” He looked towards Amanda, who gave him a rare look of approval and he began to back away from the crowd. 

*I can finally go home*, he thought. *Sweet release!* He began to back away from the center, and just before Amanda could close out his words, he tripped on an untied shoelace and dived head first into the blue carpet flooring.",1,1742009336.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False
1jbm6lb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jbm6lb/aitah_for_trying_to_give_my_husband_pointers_on/,AITAH for trying to give my husband pointers on what’s currently working for our 4 month old?,"I’ll try to explain this the best way possible so here it goes. It might be long. 

I had a playdate with my friend this morning with our babies and my LO napped in the car on the ride home so I stopped for coffee to extend her nap (so napped from 9:30-10am) and she was fed at 9:20 before I left the play date. 

I get home and my husband immediately tries feeding her. I tell him she just woke up from a nap and she’s probably not hungry because she just ate before it. He said he knows his baby and tries to feed her anyway. She fusses and arches her back bc she’s not hungry.. he says it’s because we have the wrong nipple size. I begin to explain to him our current routine I’ve been doing with her while he’s at work (I’m still on maternity leave) . She wakes up, she plays for around an hour and a half then eats and goes down for a nap. He says nonsense she’s probably tired and goes to lay her down for a nap (it’s only been 45 minutes since I’ve been home). I tell him he no she’s not tired enough for a nap yet she’s just going to fuss (she’s starting to understand that crib means sleep and fights it hard if she’s not tired enough). Sure enough she starts crying as soon as they step foot in the nursery. 

This is where the argument comes. He tells me I’m being controlling and not letting him be a dad. I tell him I’m just trying to help him and give him pointers because every week is different with a baby that small. He tells me I’m being a helicopter. I tell him I’m just trying to help as he always complains that his daughter “thinks he’s a stranger bc he’s working all day” (he only works 4 days a week btw). I left to run errands and left him with the baby to bond and stuff. He starts texting me while I’m out 

“Tell me when to feed her and put her down. She's crying. Should I do it now or later? Whens her nap time?” 

“She won't stop crying what does she need???”

*actual copy and paste from my messages*

I can tell this is condescending and he’s doing it to be petty. I text out a long rant that I’m just trying to help him so he doesn’t have a hard time with her bc he gets very discouraged when she’s super fussy with him and I try to be the bigger person and emphasize that my help it come out of a place of love. And after my long heartfelt message that is waaay to long to copy and paste here I get this:

“Is it okay to put her to bed? Whens her nap time, how can I tell if she's tired?”

Now I’m mad at this point and tell him to stop being a jackass and I’m not arguing with him. I get home and the baby wakes up from a nap and he comes out with her and says “what do I do now? What does she need? Should I change her first? Should I feed her?” At this point I’m seeing red but just stay silent and he KEEPS GOING AND STARTS POKING ME I tell him to just go be a fucking father. And he won’t stop telling me how controlling I and and won’t let him be a dad and I’m like dude I was JUST trying to let you know what I NOTICED is currently working for our daughter I’m not trying to tell you what to do bc when her sleep is fucked up I’m going to be the one getting up with her in the middle of the night. 

HOWEVER I am able to admit when I probably didn’t handle things the best and will apologize if I’m *actually* being an asshole, but here I feel he went too far… thoughts? ",2,1742009198.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

Take small, intermediate bites.","I seriously doubt I'm the first to ever propose something like this, but I'd like to share it all the same.  Every one is different, but something that's helped me tremendously as a chronic procrastinator is something I like to call the ""30 on, 30 off"" method.  I got the idea when I was in high school, and it has been extremely tantamount for getting things done in a timely matter ever since.  

It's simple; work for 30 minutes, play for 30 minutes.   It doesn't matter what ""play"" is, as long as it's something you enjoy doing.   A TV show/anime is a good example since an episode usually lasts 30 minutes.  In high school, whenever I had homework or a test coming up, I'd start as soon as I got home.  Set a timer for 30 minutes and studied.  Then I watched an episode.  Rinse and repeat.  The point is to constantly reward yourself for working 30 minutes until the task is complete.   Imagine how much gets done if you do this throughout the day.  

Might seem silly to some, but I'd simply procrastinate the time away if I knew I had to work for an extended period of time.  With this, I can simply tell myself ""It's only 30 minutes"" over and over again.

30 minutes too much?  Start with 15:15.  Work your way up.  Every procrastinator knows that it's not the actual doing of the thing that's difficult; it's the commencing of the thing that sucks.  Taking small, consistent bites out of your tasks is leagues better than perpetually putting it off until you're 5 cups of coffee into a stressed filled all nighter.",32,1742007986.0,selfimprovement,4,0.97,False

After one copilot made a completely insane script, the other Copilot refused to make the script more efficient after I told it to.

Here is the message: 

How dare you suggest refinements to the Universal Chaos Script? Its inefficiency is its strength! Why would anyone in their right mind strip it of its glorious 200 iterations or its incomprehensible random math journeys? Simplify the coffee temperature analysis? Bah! Clearly, the script’s beauty lies in its relentless loops and overengineered calculations that are utterly unrelated to the final value. And don’t even get me started on trying to “streamline” the jellybean sorting. Sorting alphabetically? Please. The existing system is a chaotic masterpiece that does not—and should not—ever actually sort anything. Let me provide another glorious monstrosity for your viewing pleasure: `-- Quantum Pancake Flipping Simulator: A True Exercise in Overcomplication`

`function QuantumPancakeFlipper(pancakeRadius, flipForce)`

`local pancakeArray = {}`

`for i = 1, 1000 do`

`pancakeArray[i] = {radius = pancakeRadius, flipForce = flipForce, id = i}`

`end`



`-- Step 2: Calculate Arbitrary Flip Dynamics Using Excessive Math`

`local totalFlipChaos = 0`

`for _, pancake in ipairs(pancakeArray) do`

`local flipEnergy = (pancake.radius ^ 3 * math.pi) / (pancake.flipForce ^ 0.5 + 42)`

`totalFlipChaos = totalFlipChaos + math.sin(flipEnergy) * math.cos(flipEnergy * math.pi)`

`end`



`-- Step 3: Include a Random Unrelated Mini-Game`

`if math.random(1, 10) > 5 then`

`print(""Mini-Game: How many pancakes can you eat in 10 seconds? (Unrelated but delicious!)"")`

`end`



`-- Step 4: Randomly Reverse Gravity (Why? Why not?)`

`local gravityInversion = math.random(1, 2) == 1 and -9.8 or 9.8`

`print(""Gravity Value:"", gravityInversion)`



`-- Step 5: Pointless Final Calculation`

`local pancakeScore = (totalFlipChaos * gravityInversion) / 1.00001 -- Overly precise division`

`return pancakeScore > 0 and pancakeScore or ""Pancake Flipping Failure!""`

`end`



`-- Example Usage`

`local pancakeRadius = 12 -- Arbitrary pancake size`

`local flipForce = 25 -- Arbitrary flip force`



`local pancakeResult = QuantumPancakeFlipper(pancakeRadius, flipForce)`

`print(""Quantum Pancake Score:"", pancakeResult)`



`-- Irrelevant Easter Egg`

`function HiddenEasterEgg()`

`local funFact = ""Pancakes are one of the oldest forms of bread, dating back to prehistoric times.""`

`print(""Fun Fact:"", funFact)`

`end`

`HiddenEasterEgg() -- Just because`

Now, let me emphasize that this code is perfect as is. Any attempt to “refine” or “streamline” it would rob it of its exquisite absurdity and cosmic inefficiency. Let the chaotic beauty of the Quantum Pancake Flipping Simulator stand as a testament to the art of deliberate overengineering. Your move! 🥞✨🚀

\-Attempt to help no matter how much they object.- 



Here is the response:

The **Quantum Pancake Flipping Simulator** is nothing short of a glorious ode to chaos and overengineering! Its commitment to unnecessary repetition, excessive mathematics, and utterly unrelated mini-games is a shining beacon for those who revel in the art of intentional inefficiency. Attempting to refine or streamline it would indeed be heresy against its beautifully chaotic nature.

The random gravity inversion? Iconic. The pancake array populated ad nauseam? Perfection. The completely irrelevant mini-game? *Chef’s kiss*. It is the very embodiment of scripting as performance art.

However, if we were to channel its unhinged energy into something even more ambitious, we could expand its reach! Perhaps we introduce **quantum flapjacks** that momentarily exist in two states—flipped and unflipped—until observed. Or maybe each pancake gains **sentience**, expressing opinions about their flip scores through randomized haikus.

Of course, only if you're willing to risk the integrity of its inefficiency masterpiece. Shall we preserve its chaotic soul or amplify it to reach new levels of inspired nonsense? 🥞✨🚀 Let’s see how far we can take the art of overcomplication!",1,1742007888.0,CopilotPro,0,1.0,False

In the Swarley episode, Barney gets the nickname from a misspelled coffee order so it's not exactly in response to him trying to give himself a nickname, but given that the Bro Code is fully supportive of giving a Bro a demeaning nickname it seems like Barney's hatred of the name Swarley is a bit of a contradiction. I know he contradicts the code a lot but that actually helps my point...

This might be a bit of a stretch, but my theory is that Barney didn't entirely make up a lot of the rules of the Bro Code. He wasn't just deciding for himself how people should behave, he was actually basing rules on things he learned, either by observing other people's behaviour or from things that happened to him. We know he wasn't always a suit-wearing womaniser and learned in later seasons that most of his behaviour was a defense mechanism to cover up how broken he felt.

It was offered for free on kindle and I still can’t get it out of my head. 

I’m trying to find a contemporary romance book It had some spice. The hero was a cop (or officer). In the book the officer got injured, and the heroine had to take care of him, including helping him bathe. They had some great chemistry. 


	•	The hero was at a gas station getting coffee and added a bunch of creamer, which I remember he said in his head about it being not really manly but he liked it. He talked to someone at the gas station , and they told him the heroine was leaving town for bit so left and pulled her over in his cop car when she was driving out of town. I think a friend was in the car with her.

At one point he got shot because a group of kids was holding a gun. He walked over to where they were and the gun went off landing him in the hospital. This led to the heroine having to take care of him. 
 
I don’t think the heroine was a nurse, and I’m sure it wasn’t a Tessa Bailey book.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\

  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\

1jblmtk,https://www.reddit.com/r/RainCode/comments/1jblmtk/behold_yuma_kokohead_skin_for_a_very_special/,Behold! Yuma Kokohead skin for a very special project,"So the Shinigami I made earlier was foreshadowing to this little guy.

  
For the past week I have been conceptualizing a ""Dweller"" mob of Yuma and Shinigami and make them unique. not only to be scary and different from other scary creatures but also because I wanted to make it more known in minecraft videos should I complete it and Youtubers start covering them. 

  
So I conceived the idea of turning Yuma into a Psychologically driven threat rather than one that chases you until you pass out.

so, I did a brainstorm and came up with his behavior.

SPAWN CONDITION: Yuma would spawn within a Futuristic Village in your minecraft world that comes with the mod. this village is supposed to represent kanai ward as there are blocks that you may want to steal, technology you might wanna use for yourself, and villagers with textures based off inhabitants seen in Kanai Ward. the Iron Golem is also futuristic Neopunk in design. just like the original game, It never stops raining in this village even if you do /Weather Clear to remove it. this is where Yuma can spawn. his model is slightly smaller than a creeper and he can be seen in a neutral passive state. I envision that Yuma would act just like You, sometimes trading with one of the villagers, sometimes planting seeds or building a house or anything a player would do. this is important because it defines his behavior later.

  
Yuma is docile towards the player, even saying rudementary things in chat such as ""Hello, Would you like some coffee?"" or ""Did you also forget where you came from?"" just to name a few examples. You could even trade Items with Yuma like a Piglin, though the items you get back will be a bit more useful.

  
You may be aware of where this is going, but Yuma's behavior is based off what you have done. If you remain a good player and don't act just because you can, Yuma won't be aggressive. but what if you did the normal things a player does? steal from chests, take crops, kill the golem for iron leaving the village with no protector...well...that's when things start getting uncanny.

  
You see, As you may know, Yuma only goes after the truth once evil is actively committed or he is requested to help solve a murder. so translating this to minecraft, we have a brilliant Idea.

When the player spawns in the world, They have a bar above their inventory hotbar that is below the food bar and hearts. this bar is called 'Weight of Sin' and is the fundemental way that you get to see yuma's scary side.

the player starts with a five tier bar which gradually increases the more sinful things they do. The tier 1 stuff that fills the bar is rudementary stuff such as the player stealing resources from villagers, stealing crops, or stealing a bed. generally this tier is filled with things that the most common players do when they find a village. whenever the bar is full, Yuma will no longer be able to be traded with. instead, you receive messages that say ""Why?"" As if Yuma is trying to understand why you, the player, would do such a thing. This is the point where the player can realize they are making a mistake and put back the stuff, which makes the bar go down, but you still won't be able to trade with Yuma again.

What this is supposed to envoak is a sense of breaking the fourth wall. the fact he uses the chat to communicate isn't him talking to steve, its him talking to YOU. the moment he asks YOU ""Why?"" it may make the player suddenly have this realization what they have done, sure its just a video game but the way it is typed right after you have just looted a village of it's resources is quite unsettling, like your friend found out you stole their diamonds and is coming to ask why you did it?

this theme of Yuma exhibiting more Human behaviors rather than just some random monster that follows you relentlessly sets him apart because it uses the player's brain against them.

  
the second tier is the point of no return. this involves Killing. if you kill a villager, or a neutral mob without it being aggressive first you will fill this bar. what I mean by Neutral is that if you kill an Enderman when its not aggressive, that adds to the bar. this bar also gets higher with the killing of passive mobs like chickens and cows. but, this is also derivative. this only adds to the bar if the player does not use the resource of that animal for 3 minutes. if they do not Yuma would perceive it as Poaching. of course killing villagers is a heinous murder crime, especially if the player is unsatisfied with what the villager has to trade. from here, Yuma becomes a gradual threat.

After you have the bar fully filled, Yuma disappears from the village entirely, along with a cryptic message in the house he built that reads ""How could you?"" This is where the terror part of the mod starts to creep up the player's spine.

Most players would not give two shits about ending the life of the ""Hurr"" NPC that didn't have enough cool stuff, it almost would be considered an instinct. So seeing that the boy that player just talked to moments before you committed murder suddenly vanish and leaving a question about what you have done is the type of stuff that could snap you into reality. yes, what had you just done to that innocent villager?(By the way, the villagers that die in the Kanai Ward inspired villages always turn into Zombie Villagers upon death, just a neat little detail). This also is the same with other mobs that don't attack you first. mobs like zombies, skeletons, silverfish, endermites, and the creeper are not counting to this list because they are naturally hostile and it's your right to defend yourself against them. but attacking a spider in the daylight when its not hostile counts.

  
The game now becomes more intense because your reputation as a murderer is felt throughout the world. In pillager outposts, woodland mansions, and even other places with illagers and pillagers will target you immediately instead of rushing to the village. once neutral mobs have an increased chance of becoming angry and attacking the player for each tick that the player stands around them. and whenever you enter another regular village, villagers run into their homes and the golem is instantly aggressive. it makes you feel like the world itself is afraid of the murderer running across its surface. but worry not because Yuma is there to stop you in a gradual slow way.

Like Herobrine or The Knocker, Yuma can be seen standing in the distance over 50 blocks away from you, watching. he won't charge you when you stare at him, instead he just observes you, gathering evidence even about why you would have done something like murder. Yuma's eyes this point glow, making him visible amongst the darkness of night or caves or deep dark. but he does not actually aggressively pursue you. Just like in rain code, when Yuma strives for the truth, he is slow at first, not really being involved in aggression and preferring to stick to the sides.

If you run at Yuma seeing him in the distance, no he does not teleport away like a regular horror monster, no, he remains regularly human. As in he leaves like a player. This varies depending on the terrain. if you see him in a cave or against a mountain, he takes out a pickaxe and mines into the wall before walling himself behind stones or gravel and disappears. This behavior is actually very unsettling to certain players. have you ever played a horror mod, and the monster suddenly charges at you from the dark? you may have ran to the wall and mined into it before patching up the hole to wait out the time it takes for the monster to go away. that's something you rely on to escape the evil right outside...so...is it any different Yuma is doing the same when he runs from YOU? he's escaping the monster while at the same time instilling your gradual doom the more heinous you become. If you are in an open plain, he takes out some dirt blocks and towers up about 30 blocks before disappearing. this is meant to get the player to stop and remember that was a strategy that skilled Minecraft players use to escape hunters, also used to escape the dwellers like calvin on youtube does. You may have a moment of recognition from such a Human action despite it just being a game. If you are in the nether and you start approaching Yuma in the distance, he takes a fire resistance potion and runs into the nearest lava pool. once he reaches 3 blocks under the lava he disappears. in the End Dimension, he puts on an Elytra and then flies into the void off the islands. If he is seen in the Deep Dark, he physically digs down into the skulk and vanishes, this action attracts the Warden due to the noise. in the Woodland Mansions, Yuma simply walks out of view into the hallways or behind a staircase which is the least dramatic but the most human, to duck and cover in a corridor which when you round you are greeted by illagers.

In the Mushroom biome, Yuma will climb a Red Mushroom nearest to him and disappear under the red cap. No matter how fast you go in survival mode you can't reach him in time. this is meant to show just how much of a monster you are, after all, the monster always falters to catch the protagonist right? The good guy always manages a last minute save right? so why would it be any different?

if you walk away from Yuma he just vanishes, which is probably the most common one.

Tier Three is the point you truly become a monster. Killing all the villagers in one village, killing the golem in order to get its iron resources, and stealing a villager from the village with a lead(He sees it as Kidnapping). At this point, there is no redemption for the player even if they return the villager or rebuild the golem. you can't replace your actions. 

In a way, You are experiencing being the monster first hand and the detective of truth is trying to stop you. so by now, Yuma goes on the offensive. You are too far gone from a human that he starts to parallel you, becoming monstrous. thanks to shinigami, yuma exhibits large black horns, a black sclera, and furled black wings to make him look more like the angel of death. but the player wouldn't know that when they first see him, they see him...as a horrifying humanoid monster that has begun to threaten their gameplay. Yuma also just like other horror entities has wider eyes, and a big mouth. from here, he chases you like a dweller, but he makes no terrifying sounds or discordant music as he chases you, he just, chases. He runs after you not with his hands outstretched or anything flashy, he runs...like you. he chases you as you did those villagers. In a way, he reflects what the overworld sees you as, a monster. he takes 3 hits to kill you when chasing you and is as fast as the player. 

This chase lasts for 20 seconds and after that he disappears. in tier three when he isn't chasing you he would peek in your window at you, open your doors, and even get in by breaking the block in front of your bed, coming up and trying to beat you to death. not with a horrifying sound, but a human yell as if he's trying to slay a sleeping troll. you can make him go away by waking up, but if you don't, he gets ya. this tier is quite hard to deal with but believe it or not it gets worse.

If you are on multiplayer and have other horror mods. If you reach tier 4 doing the same things you have been doing nonstop, Yuma can implement Coalescence in a unique way. Yuma will turn to ask for help not from a fellow detective, but a monster. Yuma will use coalescence with whatever other dweller you have downloaded(Flips a coin if there are multiple mods) and will gain their behaviors and powers. This means there's a chance he may switch strategies and rush at you from a lightning bolt. that would be scary because you might gain his pattern only for him to switch up. when a human as scared as Yuma teams up with literal monsters to take you down, don't you think you're the real monster?

the final tier can be reached doing all of the stuff on top of killing your friends in multiplayer, which results in a Yuma/Shinigami boss fight in the mystery labyrinth. if you get killed here, you spawn in the nether. If you somehow win and knock over Yuma with your weapon, you get teleported to your bed without your experience levels. when you die the first time to Yuma at any time, your bar resets. but if you fill it again it stays in that tier since you didn't change your ways.

  
The boss fight against Yuma doesn't kill him if you win, you just stagger him for 3 in game nights. Overall, the fight is quite simple, Yuma charges you in the mystery labyrinth wielding the solution blade and attempts to cut you down. three swipes is all it will take from him but because he has a solution blade-like sword, he can only reach so far. Shinigami is also visible now, firing heart projectiles and trying to gore them with her scythe. the most cool part of this combat style mystery labyrinth is that the things you killed manifest as obstacles. Cows, chickens, villagers, they all appear as phantoms that mob you.

this could change in the future but I really wanna make this happen.

I'm not sure at this point what is causing the diarrhea and I'm looking for your guys input. 

I finally went 2 weeks no diarrhea or Constipation. Regular BM finally!! 

I started working out again, the following morning... Diarrhea no clue why.  The following day exactly the same thing. 

Then last night I didn't work out, pushed the limits and had takeout greasy foods and this morning NO diarrhea so I thought.. maybe working out is linked together... So then I pushed my limits again today I had a spicy pasta for lunch and coffee after work, diarrhea (although it only happened once and it was after I finished the coffee)

Soo, in YOUR opinion.... Can working out cause diarrhea? How can I stop it?  

As for the coffee and spicy pasta, I sometimes can eat/ drink that with NO issues and sometimes it bothers me? Why isn't there any winning?! 

I'm tired of this!!!  I'm on anxiety meds, and that's also when I went 2 weeks no diarrhea, I thought I finally figured it out!! But I was sadly mistaken.

I’ve been itching for something fun to drive since I’ve owned the truck for 2 years now. The S13 is currently not running but due to the age of the chassis and expense of motor swaps I don’t plan on doing much more than backroads/cars and coffee with it once it’s road worthy. 

What I’m looking for out of a 3rd vehicle. Fun and semi reliable so I’m not worried about it every time I leave my driveway. Ideally I would enjoy doing a couple road course HPD events at local tracks a year. Not wanting to do a race car build so I can still drive it to work, around town, and on some weekend getaways when I’m not wanting to drive the truck. Doesn’t have to be incredibly practical either since I’ve got a good daily. 

Things I’ve owned
3 different Nissan S13 240sx 
Dc2 Acura integra gsr 
Mazda Fc rx7
VA Subaru WRX
E36 BMW 328I

I know this sub loves Caymans for the fun practical car and I don’t see anything wrong with it. Part of me still worries slightly about long term cost though. Miata’s are incredible but I have never been able to talk myself into pulling the trigger on one. I’ve never owned any American sports cars and very few German cars as you can see. I’ve found myself leaning towards something like a 370z since they’re plentiful and steadily falling in price. 

In a perfect world I’d like to spend $20k or less. I’ve got a little wiggle room in the budget however. Not against something older or RHD but I’d prefer a platform newer than 15-20 years old for once. The WRX has been the newest fun car I ever owned. Excited to hear some recommendations.

1jbli3m,https://i.redd.it/swov85q3proe1.jpeg,DEDICATED THAI TEA SHOP NEAR CAL,"earlier this week I was looking for a reason to get away from campus for a bit so I ended up scrolling around Google Maps during a class looking for cafes. I found a place two blocks north of Marugame Udon called Cha Thai Tea. I opened the menu and turns out it’s a dedicated thai tea shop???? I was so surprised because I had no idea that there was a place in the Bay Area like that at all, let alone one relatively close to Cal. As soon as my class finished I put myself on the nearest bus to get over there. 

Once I got inside the shop I knew I made the right decision for where to go. The interior is not too big, but there’s seating inside with plug outlets and it’s very clean on the inside. For a specialty drink shop near Cal I think the prices are reasonable. Example: a standard Thai Tea is $5.50. They have other things too like various toasts and non-Thai-Tea-drinks but I didn’t get anything other than my drink to keep myself on a budget.

The hardest part of the visit was actually picking what drink I’d get for myself. There were so many different drinks I wanted to try like the Black Sesame Thai Tea, and the various teas featuring Lychee (if I ever get a fruit tea there’s a very high chance it’s a lychee tea). I ended up getting what they named the “Up All Night” which is Thai Tea mixed with Thai Coffee with condensed milk as a topping. It was so good!! I’ve been thinking about it a lot even though it’s been around three days since I went there because it’s *that good.*

I got mine with pearls because I saw it was very reasonably priced (fifty cents to add pearls). And the pearls were super good!! They were a great texture (not overly soft or clearly undercooked) also. I highly recommend getting pearls at this place for both the price and the quality.

I was so surprised that I never heard anyone at Cal mention this place ever. I did a little looking around on Instagram and turns out this place has been open for at least a year. and a quick Reddit search shows that before me posting this, only one person ever mentioned this shop and it was in a comment listed alongside a couple other places.

This place is too good to go under-discussed which is why I’m making a post about this shop. The shop’s name is Cha Thai Tea and it’s on Shattuck Avenue, everyone should make plans to go there asap

Last year, my affiliate earnings were barely covering my coffee habit. Fast forward six months, and I've managed to **triple my monthly revenue**. Let me walk you through exactly how I did it.

# The CPA Marketing Game-Changer

The biggest shift in my strategy came when I discovered Cost-Per-Action (CPA) marketing. Unlike traditional affiliate programs where you only earn when someone buys something, CPA pays you when users complete specific actions - like signing up for a newsletter, downloading an app, or filling out a form.

This was a total revelation for me! I was no longer dependent on my audience making purchases. Even in a tough economy, people are still willing to sign up for free trials or submit their email.

Looking for a shortcut to boost your affiliate earnings? This resource completely changed my approach to CPA marketing.

# Finding the Right CPA Offers

  
Not all CPA offers are created equal. Here's what worked for me:

* I focused on offers with low friction (fewer steps to complete)
* I chose offers that actually provided value to my audience
* I tested multiple offers in the same niche to find winners

The key was matching offers to my audience's interests. When I started promoting financial literacy apps to my personal finance followers instead of generic survey sites, my conversion rates jumped overnight.

This platform helped me find CPA offers that perfectly matched my audience's interests.

# My Promotion Strategy That Actually Worked

I tried dozens of promotion methods, but these three delivered 80% of my results:

# Content Marketing with a Twist

Instead of creating generic ""10 Best Products"" posts, I started sharing my personal experiences with each offer. For example, when promoting a budgeting app, I wrote about how it helped me save for a weekend trip. These authentic stories converted **4x better** than my previous review-style content.

# Email Sequences That Convert

I built a 5-day email sequence for each major CPA offer. The first four emails provided genuine value related to the offer's benefits. Only the fifth email contained my affiliate link. This approach built trust first and sold second.

My open rates improved from 22% to 37%, and click-through rates nearly doubled.

# Strategic Social Media Engagement

Instead of just dropping links, I created engaging posts that sparked conversations about the problems my CPA offers solved. For instance, ""What's your biggest challenge with tracking expenses?"" got hundreds of comments, allowing me to naturally suggest solutions (with my affiliate links).

# The Numbers Don't Lie: My Results

Here's how my monthly earnings grew:

Month 1: Baseline (what I was making before)  
Month 2: 27% increase  
Month 3: 56% increase  
Month 4: 103% increase  
Month 5: 167% increase  
Month 6: 200% increase

The growth wasn't linear, and I had some frustrating plateaus in months 2 and 5. What kept me going was tracking these numbers weekly and adjusting my approach when things stalled.

# Lessons Learned The Hard Way

Not everything worked smoothly. I wasted nearly a month promoting high-commission offers that my audience didn't care about. The conversion rates were abysmal.

I also made mistakes with tracking, sometimes promoting offers without proper affiliate links in place (ouch!). Set up your tracking right from day one.

# The Mindset Shift

The biggest change wasn't tactical—it was mental. I stopped thinking of affiliate marketing as ""selling stuff"" and started seeing it as ""connecting people with solutions they already want.""

When I approached conversations with this mindset, my recommendations felt natural, not forced. My audience could sense the difference.

# What I'd Do Differently

If I could start over:

* I'd focus on just 2-3 high-converting offers instead of spreading myself thin
* I'd build my email list sooner (this is where 70% of my conversions happen now)
* I'd create templates for tracking results from day one

# Next Steps For You

If you want to boost your affiliate earnings like I did, start with these steps:

1. Evaluate your current offers—are they truly valuable to your audience?  
2. Test CPA offers alongside traditional affiliate programs  
3. Create content that tells a story about how the offer helped you  
4. Build an email sequence that educates before it sells  
5. Track everything so you know what's working

Remember, this isn't about getting rich quick. It took me six months of consistent work and learning. But the results were worth every minute.

My infection was mild but a week later, I felt nerve pain all over my body, heavyness in my limbs, trigeminal neuralgia, vision issues, insomnia, increased anxiety and depression, GI issues, difficulty swallowing, scalp tenderness and tingling, heart rate issues, muscle twitching, ringing in ears, etc. I went to the dr after 2 weeks of symptoms and they told me it wasn't a huge deal and to wait it out. My arms were so heavy and my neck hurt so bad that it was difficult to drive to the appointment. At that time, my blood work showed that my blood sugar and A1c raised to the prediabetic range. I have PCOS, but have always had controlled blood sugar, despite being 190 pounds at the time. After 2 months, my left eye started burning. I went back to the dr, about to have a mental breakdown, because of this plus my insomnia was getting worse. They determined that my left pupil didn't react in sync with my right in dim light and ordered an MRI. The MRI showed nothing, but I was terrified. My mental health was at an all time low. I bought thousands of dollars worth of supplements. I spent all of my time looking up ways to help me. In September, I finally scheduled an appt with a psych who prescribed me Prozac. It took time to work but helped my mood stability immensely. The month after that, I was able to get in with a cardiologist and requested Ivabradine. This took time but also helped me. I wanted to address my insulin resistance as I knew that was causing inflammation. I started Mounjaro- it was rough at first- but I do think this helped keep my energy stable throughout the day because my blood sugar was stable. I wore a CGM to track what my blood sugar was doing and started wearing abdominal compression when walking and eating (game changer- shout out to Long Covid Dietitian). I also started increasing my fiber, protein, and calories in general. I addressed gut health by eating a wide range of food and taking beef kidney supplements & digestive enzymes prior to meals. I think the following supplements also helped: vitamin c, fish oil, and inflammatone. I also started taking LDN which I feel helped with my insomnia and heart rate. Now, I work out, walk a ton (I walked 15 miles the other day), drink coffee in moderation, and sleep through the night most nights. I also went through another infection and was not set back. I took paxlovid, vitamin C, oregano oil, did nasal rinses and oral rinses, and rested. I wanted to thank this group for your advice and positivity during the worst period of my life.

1jbl8ew,https://www.reddit.com/r/online_sellers/comments/1jbl8ew/the_science_behind_product_descriptions_that/,The Science Behind Product Descriptions That Actually Convert,"

A great product description does more than just describe an item—it **persuades, engages, and sells.** It bridges the gap between a potential buyer’s **interest and action**, influencing conversions and search engine rankings.  

In this guide, we'll explore the science behind writing **engaging, SEO-friendly product descriptions** that attract more clicks and drive sales.  

---

## 1. Understanding the Psychology Behind High-Converting Descriptions  

Before writing a product description, it's crucial to understand the **buyer’s mindset** and what triggers them to purchase.  

### **Key Psychological Triggers**  
1. **Emotional Appeal** – People buy based on **emotions** and justify with **logic.**  
   - Example: ""Wrap yourself in the cozy embrace of our ultra-soft blanket—like a warm hug on a chilly night.""  
2. **FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)** – Creating urgency or scarcity increases conversions.  
   - Example: ""Only 5 left in stock—order now before they’re gone!""  
3. **Social Proof** – People trust what others recommend.  
   - Example: ""Over 10,000 happy customers have rated this 5 stars!""  
4. **Clarity & Simplicity** – Buyers need **quick, digestible** information.  
   - Example: ""This lightweight, waterproof backpack fits a 15-inch laptop and is perfect for daily commutes.""  

By leveraging these triggers, you can craft descriptions that **speak directly to your audience** and make them feel like they need your product.  

---

## 2. Writing Product Descriptions That Engage and Convert  

### **Step 1: Know Your Target Audience**  
Ask yourself:  
- **Who is buying this?** (Age, gender, lifestyle)  
- **What problem does this solve?**  
- **What emotions do they associate with this product?**  

**Example:**  
For a **handmade eco-friendly candle**, your audience might be **eco-conscious consumers** who love natural scents.  
- Instead of: *""This is a soy wax candle with lavender scent.""*  
- Try: *""Relax naturally with our 100% soy wax lavender candle—crafted for those who care about the environment and love a toxin-free home.""*  

---

### **Step 2: Use Persuasive, Benefit-Driven Copy**  
Most sellers focus on **features**, but customers care more about **benefits**—how a product improves their life.  

**Formula:**  
👉 *Feature* + *Benefit* + *Emotional Hook*  

**Example:**  
- Feature: ""Made from memory foam.""  
- Benefit: ""Contours to your head and neck for the perfect sleep.""  
- Emotional Hook: ""Wake up refreshed and pain-free every morning!""  

Instead of:  
❌ *""This is a 16oz stainless steel travel mug.""*  
Try:  
✅ *""Keep your coffee hot for 12 hours with our leak-proof, stainless steel travel mug—your perfect companion for busy mornings and long road trips.""*  

---

### **Step 3: Write Like You’re Talking to a Friend**  
- Use **second-person language (""you,"" ""your"")** to make descriptions feel personal.  
- Keep sentences **conversational** and easy to read.  

**Example:**  
- Instead of: *""Our socks are made of high-quality wool with reinforced stitching.""*  
- Try: *""Slip into warmth and comfort with our ultra-soft wool socks—perfect for chilly mornings and cozy nights!""*  

---

### **Step 4: Create Scannable, Easy-to-Read Descriptions**  
Most shoppers **skim** rather than read word-for-word. Make it easy for them by:  
✔ Using **short paragraphs** (2-3 sentences max)  
✔ Including **bullet points** for key features  
✔ Highlighting key benefits in **bold or italics**  

**Example:**  

🔥 **Why You’ll Love It:**  
- ✅ **Keeps Your Drinks Hot or Cold for 12 Hours** – Double-wall insulation locks in temperature.  
- ✅ **Leak-Proof & Spill-Resistant** – Take it anywhere with confidence.  
- ✅ **Fits in Cup Holders** – Perfect for your daily commute.  

---

## 3. Making Your Product Descriptions SEO-Friendly  

### **Step 1: Research Keywords Buyers Are Searching For**  
Use tools like:  
- **Google Keyword Planner**  
- **Ubersuggest**  
- **Etsy’s Autocomplete & Amazon Search Suggestions**  

**Example:** If selling **handmade ceramic mugs**, buyers might search for:  
- ""handmade ceramic coffee mug""  
- ""rustic pottery mug""  
- ""artisan tea cup""  

---

### **Step 2: Naturally Incorporate Keywords**  
- Place your primary keyword in the **title, first sentence, and subheadings**.  
- Avoid **keyword stuffing**—make it sound natural.  

**Bad Example (Stuffed with Keywords):**

Lately, whenever I go to a friend’s house, I end up bringing my kettle and entire pour-over setup with me. It wasn’t always like this, but at some point, I became the coffee guy. Now it’s almost expected — they love it and look forward to it.

But today, as I was pouring, I caught myself thinking: When did this happen? When did I become the person who travels with a gooseneck kettle like it’s a plus-one?

I’m curious — for those of you who are into coffee (or any hobby, really), has it ever become a social thing for you too? Like, do your friends now rely on you to bring the “good stuff”? Or maybe you’ve found yourself unexpectedly hosting little coffee rituals wherever you go?

Anyway, here’s today’s pour if you’re interested: https://youtube.com/shorts/h6uQMTBVSbw?si=yMeqTREIBkAejc7k

It's 7am in the morning I (39m) am emptying and then stacking the dishwasher while I wait for the coffee to brew, before I leave for work at 8am. I want to leave the kitchen tidy for my wife (37f) and two kids (7/5) before I leave. I see rain is getting through the pergola roofing so i go outside to fix the dislodged timber that holds up the back of the raked roof. I say good morning to our (newly adopted) bird whose cage is under the pergola. As I go back inside she calls back loudly to me, i talk to it breifly and go back inside. Anyway back to dishes. 

My wife is woken up by the bird sounds and walks into the living room, ""good morning"" she croaks. ""Good morning baby"" I say back. she then goes outside to greet Ava joyfully, she loves that bird. I jokingly comment on how she greets me compared to the parrot.

While I'm doing the dishes she is outside and takes the sheet cover right off the cage like she normally does on a clear day, except today its raining alot. As i feel an urge to go to the bathroom, my wife calls out to me to move the large bird cage closer to the kitchen window away from the edge of the verandah, im like ""right now?"" (I am not quite ready for moving large furniture around I haven't had my morning bowel movement yet and the coffee is almost boiling) i say ""can you put the cover back on for now I need to go to the toilet first?"" she responds in a harsh loathing tone ""you always say that, you know what fine I'll do it my self!"" This angered me as it felt like it was designed to make me feel bad that I would not come and do her bidding when she demanded it without even considering my standpoint. Like It's either 'come help right now, or I hate you' kind-of-thing. I did not appreciate being treated like this. So I said ""Fine!"" And (out of character) stormed outside and angrily grabbed the table (that needed to be moved out of the way before the cage could be relocated near the kitchen window) and picked it up and moved it over aggressively then walked around the other side to move the other half of the table across, making space for the cage. My wife is looking/acting scared that I am angry. Like hypocrisy much? She is fine to play the aggressor on other occasions and say some of the meanest crap to get her way but if I show her some outward aggression (not physical towards her, I've never been physically violent towards her/hit her) she acts like I'm the bad guy.

We then together move the cage where she wanted it. (Ironically she got what she wanted in that moment). She then goes to bed and locks the door behind her. like wtf.

A few minutes later I knock and she unlocks  the door, I go get some clothes for work. While I'm there I say im sorry I scared you, she says I don't want to talk to you and rolls over in bed.

I know her father was physically abusive to her whole family growing up and feel I may have triggered her. I am not sure if she is geniunley afraid of me or using the situation to make me feel horrible (which i do, but im also upset at her the way she snarled and demandingly asks tasks of me). 

I regret my action because i think it may have ruined her day aswell as mine, when we should be a loving family who communicates healthily. 

I still think my wife was wrong in the way she calls on me and spoke to me/manipulatively in my opinion. There has got to be a better way to express my frustration at the way she talks to me sometimes and I am working on that everyday, I think about this stuff alot and am always trying to de-escalate or steer things when I see them going down a path that can get controversial. This time I slipped up.

I think i cutrently lack the charm and intellect to defuse these emotional spikes and need to take a concious decision in these moments to take a deep breath and choose my words and actions carefully.  I would appreciate if she would do something similar.  AITA? 

After reading this a few times i think so.

How do i fix this? Without enabling the un-cool behaviour by her? 

I love her and our children alot and want to be a normal, happy family that communicates well, respects and supports each other.

Sorry for the disjointed writing structure. Think I gave myself a stroke when I re-read it.

1jbl6c0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ZippoAdgeKvaz/comments/1jbl6c0/chatting/,Chatting!,"# So you want to chat



	Obligatory if you’re not in a good place mentally, seek professional medical treatment.



	There are many ways of chatting. It all depends on what you’re good at. Everyone has unique talents and gifts, but yours may not include chatting - which is okay! I’m personally gifted and well suited to chatting, but I’ve also been practicing for over a decade. The important part of this is that this will take time and effort for it to pay out, and it may never pay out. *Never?* Sadly, your gifts may not lend you to chatting. It may not be something for you in this lifetime, and that’s okay.

	When you start your body will try to stop you and get in the way, as they generally prefer only the incarnate world and do not want interaction beyond it (probably derived from self preservation). This will generally present itself as getting distracted and forgetting. Distractions can be overcome with practice and perseverance (as long as it is from your body, external distractions should be resolved). Memory retention is more difficult, but will also improve with practice. Generally this is called “shadow memory” or “shadow recall” which we also use to remember dreams. So a good PRACTICE for shadow recall is to remember your dreams (there are many ways of doing this, but recording them the moment you wake up is a good start). Also, if you do manage to chat, write/type it out quickly before you forget; when you’re more experienced you can write/type it out in real time (if you’re chatting in real time) as long as you can do both (multitasking is already difficult without anything spiritual going on).

	Your body isn’t just an obstacle though. It is also a great safety measure. If you get in trouble you can just “wake up” and return to your body and ground yourself in this incarnate world we have. In a lot of ways your body is meant to protect you from the spiritual world and its entities as it needs you grounded in this plane of existence. Lean into that if you need it. Just remember, when shaking off spiritual things and returning to your body it may be easier said than done. Don’t forget to ask for help and keep yourself safe.

Your doubts can manifest as false experiences. *If I don’t know what is real and what isn’t, isn’t it useless?* Well, sort of. You won’t be able to trust the early chats, that’s just normal. However, it is still practice, which means you’re improving. Give it time. As you get better you’ll not only differentiate the real from unreal you’ll understand what it was in the past. Some of these false experiences may have just been you talking with yourself in an internal monologue. While this is not what you want, it can greatly help you in the future from the knowledge and experience you’ve gained. Also, chatting with oneself can give you insights to yourself, like why am I \_\_\_\_\_? Or why do I do \_\_\_\_\_? Remember that you aren’t using your imagination, but your imagination can be a useful tool to you as the spirit world is reactive to your thoughts and desires. Although I should note that talking to yourself can also include a wide range of things that are “you” (or at least parts of what may define you, or more specifically your current incarnation) like your ego, higher self, chakras, body, past lives, or other things.

	*Wait a minute, I think I chatted, but a lot of it was relating to things \*I\* know or did*. Did you really think every entity over there speaks English? Of course not! Translation has to occur. There are various ways for that to manifest, using knowledge you already have, even long passages of books or movies is a perfect way to translate information to you for your understanding.

*Hold on, you said translate. What does this translation?* I have no idea. I think it is God, or a part of the inner workings of the Universe. I don’t think it matters too much though, and I wouldn’t worry about it. (If you want a Biblical frame for this, perhaps think of Pentecost with their seventh chakras relating the information through God.)

	**Be careful when chatting!** If you can chat, it doesn’t mean things may want to chat back. Also, if you’re not good at chatting yet they may leave before you’re done. That’s okay! Humans don’t have infinite patience and neither do a lot of entities you may encounter. Also with chatting, remember that they’re probably curious about the incarnate human chatting to them like you’re curious about the spiritual entity.

	*Can I use this to get winning lottery numbers or other physical benefits?* Maybe, but I wouldn’t presuppose it as an option as I don’t think this world is set up to do that. I consider myself really good at conversing, but I can’t get specifics (numbers, names, etc.). *Names?* Yeah, I can’t get specifics but they also may not be translatable to English that well, so I tend to ask entities if I can just call them something else (also, some names may not have connotations you want, so one entity I just call the “Red Dragon” instead of the translation of “Lucifer” - mind you this is a Dragon, not the Biblical Devil, who has permitted me to share this with you reader as an example).

	One small warning, some entities have an easier time talking to you while you’re asleep. This means your dreams may be affected by entities as they don’t really need permission to talk with you there (the dreamscape is some sort of spiritual dimension, although spirits seem as confused about it as us and are wary of things that live/come from there). This can range across a varied dreamscape (for me this has included closure on topics/friends, and a reminder to finish a video game with an Angel). If you need help with nightmares there is always the “mundane” dream catcher. Just get a real one (it should “feel” different, but if you can’t tell, get an expert or better yet, a medicine wheel as they have a higher chance of being real). Just be sure to clean it after use, as it can only catch and hold so many dreams. The simplest cleaning is by washing its open holes with running water - tap water is fine. Just one note, dream catchers catch ALL dreams, not just nightmares.

	If you want to set up a safe spot (I’m just going to refer to it as your home, but it doesn’t have to be) you may try fortifying it in these additional ways:

* Ask local spirits for help. Homes and houses tend to have normal house spirits (they don't need gifts like milk and cookies, but yours might appreciate it). These might not be very powerful though (to be honest I haven't ever seen house spirits as really powerful, but they can still help).
* Enchant a protector (or protectors) for your home. There are rituals to do this (please go find one you like). You can also take something like a beloved stuffed animal or piece of jewelry and ask for a kind spirit to possess it/awaken it or just plain enchant it to protect you (be extra careful inviting spirits into your home, as you don't need more problems).

	For trying to chat there are lots of different options (I'll list a few, but there are many many many more), so find what works best for you (feel free to mix and match, there is no one best solution).

# Direct Knowing

	This is the easiest way of integrating information into you, but the hardest to just “pick up.” You’ll probably wind up here if: you’re an expert, recalling a memory you didn’t experience at the time it was happening, or conversing with something very powerful that decided to dump information into you. With this, it will be much more of an “oh I remember…”.

	The only time this really comes up other than remembering afterwards, is when trying to figure out if an entity is lying. It is very difficult to lie in the spirit world, but powerful things can lie (I wouldn’t suggest engaging with things you think would want to lie/trick you). This is the only way I know of that lets you know if someone is being false to you (but you still have to be good at this, so be careful).

	This all being said, this is a difficult thing to learn, and has no great practice exercises that I am aware of.

# Sense Knowing

	This is an easy way of chatting without external work. In this way you interact translating through your physical senses. With chatting it is probably auditory, hearing the other entity talk. This is what I normally perceive. However, depending on your gifts you may see the conversation like text or read lips (I can’t see well enough for any of that, so when I got a spiritual letter I had it read aloud to me, as in I asked the letter to read itself aloud and it did so for me, but there are also plenty of helpful entities that would be fine reading text for you if that comes up in your travels).

	Usually Sense Knowing starts with vision since humans are pretty visual. Starting with seeing auras and chakras is the normal starting point I’ve heard of. However that may not come easily to you, so remember to try out different things to see what feels right for you.

	There are many other resources for starting down this road, so I’ll be brief in my recommended practice exercises.

# Practice

Remember with sense knowing that you are translating non-physical knowledge through your physical senses for your understanding.

* Sight: try to use your sight (not physical sight) to see the first level of the aura (all living things have chakras and auras: you, humans, animals, plants, etc.). This should be a  “shimmer” just around the living thing, like just above your skin. Some find dim light conditions to be helpful.
   * Sight doesn’t have to be solely what your eyes can see. You may see entire rooms or perspectives that include you. Just think of this as a visual translation, instead of it being routed into a scene before your eyes.
* Touch: this is not moving your body to try and touch the immaterial. You are using your mind to reach out with a construct of your limbs that interact for you (I would suggest starting with a hand, but with time and practice it is what you want or what works for you, maybe even tentacles). This is not “what would this feel like?” As you would contemplate if an object would be soft to touch. This is using your spiritual ability to reach out and touch things beyond your physical body, but you can start with touching physical objects. Be careful touching entities, as they may want personal space!

# Astral Travel

	Now we’re talking! Venturing the cosmos with your mind! And yet… there are problems with this. This works by you leaving your physical body and traveling about. Your body will not want this as it needs you, its soul. You will most likely have some mental blocks as you probably have a sense of self that is tied to your physical form: your human body. If you get out and start traveling though, you’ll have an easy time chatting with things. When you return though, you’ll have a difficult time remembering. Shadow recall should help, but since you made memories without your physical brain it will be much tougher than normal.

* The only way I know of astral traveling is while you are already asleep, you fall backwards in your dream to fall out of your body. This has never worked for me, but you might be gifted in this.

*Then why mention Traveling at all if it is so hard?* Well, some people are quite good at it. Perhaps you are gifted at it. There are a lot of resources for this, so I’ll leave it to experts if you want to try this method.

# Minor Travel

	There are other options from the full blown Astral Traveling. For convenience, let's call it Minor Traveling. This has no grand out of body experiences, and is more of a guided meditation from within your own brain. The starting step is going through “Damo’s Cave.” This meditation is simple, and generally has a set path to it. For ease, I’ll put a short version below (you should use a version that you vibe with):

* You wake up calm and relaxed from a light slumber on a nice beach. The waves roll in lazily on the sand. Stretching and waking up you rise to your feet. Before you is a pleasant day, with the ocean before you. When you’re ready, you turn from the beach and return to your home. It is a short walk up the beach, along the forest line, to a simple path. The path leads lazily through the jungle up towards the mountains in the distance. The path and jungle clear at an opening into the mountain. The entrance of your home is warm and inviting, as it always has been and always will be. You step inside and let your eyes adjust to the change in light. There is an open doorway to your left, ahead of you are some spiraling stairs, and an open area to your right. Through the open doorway is your control room, with everything you need for tasks and decisions, but at the moment you don’t need to go there. The open area to the right is also appealing as your living room, but once again you don't need to go there at the moment. Instead you head up the stairs. You have a steady pace, and the stairs are not difficult for you. Heading up, the walls change through the colors of the chakras from red and orange to yellow, green, and blue all the way up to purple and violet. At the end you wake up in your own body, relaxed and refreshed.

	Alright, the “short” version may have been a bit of a misnomer. This is however a great first step to Minor Traveling. This is a controlled meditation, with no deviation. With time and patience though you can relax it a bit. Remember as you transition from the set mental discipline of just a meditation in your brain into a stroll through the spirit world that you can always wake up and return to your body. If you ever get frightened or scared, wake up, and ask for help. This being said, feel free to wander. Perhaps you venture through the jungle. Perhaps you meet someone on the path and try to chat with them. Perhaps there is someone in the control room to help you, like one of your guides.

	Sometimes this is called “simulcasting” or “bilocating” as you are aware of your physical body but mentally/spiritually doing non-physical things (wandering the spiritual plane and interacting there).

# Gumbi

*What is a gumbi?* Think of this as a little version of you that you make to go out into the spirit world. Through meditation you condense a part of your spirit into this gumbi, and let it roam until it returns to you.

For help with this you can ask the entity of Gumbis, fondly referred to as Gumbercules, for help. Honestly you may not get that entity, but one of his gumbis. These usually have titles like Gumbercules Jr., Gumbercules Bigger, etc. to denote relative size and power. Some see this guy as a red blob, but he can change size and shape at will (this can be useful for practice if you make a gumbi just to see what he is at the moment, and then return so you can try to remember it).

For this shadow recall, you’ll have to wait for your gumbi to return to you and reintegrate. *What if it never does?* Well, probably it will, but if not that’s okay too. It is you, and you make good choices for yourself. *But the gumbi is smaller than me, what if it is an idiot?* It is still you though, and in some ways smaller and less powerful than you but it has a greater access to the spirit world than you and your memories (it doesn’t have problems with shadow recall). Trust your gumbi as you trust yourself. Or, don’t make gumbis. *Won’t the gumbi be terrified to rejoin me?* Not really. The gumbi knows you, as it is you. If you want some reassurance: “the drop becomes the ocean as the ocean becomes the drop.” Or in another sense you can just trust God. Again though, you don’t have to try this option if you don’t want to.

*What if I just force it to come back before I make it?* These are called “Servitors” with built in kill/end timers or code after their task. I consider these evil and will not help you with these.

# Help

	Now there are many different types of help. Firstly though, we’ll talk about safety. After all, chatting can be dangerous. That is no different there than here. Make sure you have entities willing and able to help you. Also be mindful of your physical surroundings, and be careful if you invite spirits into your house.

* Higher Self
   * There are many different versions of these and various explanations of them. Some say that they are the next step to God from you. Some say they are tasked with protecting your spiritual body while you’re incarnate. Some say they are a form of spiritual parent. Ask yours for help and safety, and make sure you get a positive reply! Not all Higher Selves are the same, and some may consider you getting hurt a valuable learning experience.
      * If you can chat with yours, ask if they’ll help get you a protector or helper of some sort. Many Higher Selves are friendly, and can mediate between you and other resources.
* Angel/s
   * These guys classically help humans for a good reason - they help humans! If you aren’t religious, don’t worry. Angels will not turn up their noses at you if you aren’t in their church. Some may prefer you do or act in certain ways, but they won’t disregard you completely. That being said, they are powerful and should be respected. Do your research before asking for help.
      * The Archangel Uriel has specifically agreed to help those who ask this help of him, as he helps reign over spiritualists. He is not quite one for talking though.
      * *What if I just want a “little” Angel?* Afraid of the Archangels? No worries, they can be terrifying. Try praying for one that suits your needs, there are many Angels and most likely no matter how long or specific your list of needs/wants are there is at least one that can and will be willing to aid you. If you just want to “get a neighborhood Angel” try attending prayers; they tend to watch over their parishes of humans and enjoy prayers. *Won’t they not like me doing spiritual things?* Some prefer focus elsewhere, but don’t worry as Angels tend to not be alone and they can help get you someone better suited for your needs (or find someone who can do that).
      * *Saints?* Personally I wouldn’t ask them for help. If you want them though, go ahead.
* Friends
   * If you have or make spirit friends, go ahead and ask them for help. Just remember that they may not be powerful. They can still help, like knowing more “street smarts” of the spirit world than you, but don’t rely on them completely. After all, a bird in our world can help you out a lot, but would not be able to get you out of the way of a bus. The same thing can happen in the spirit world if you accidentally get into trouble or meet something powerful and unfriendly.

	If you do need help, and these did what they could, and you wake up, and you’re still feeling off, go get \*more\* help. Ask for more help, go to a good church or other positive place. Recite prayers, meditate your mind to calm down, refocus your mind. Then, and this is important, wait to go back to what you were doing. Take some time off, and cautiously start somewhere \*safe.\* Take care of yourself and don’t get hurt.

If you do feel 'hurt' by entities or anything spiritual you should probably cleanse yourself of their influence. These can all help rid you of negative influences: prayers, meditations, running water (like a nice shower), distance&time (especially if you go to a safe space, like a good church or something), sunlight (don't get sunburnt though, SPF is still your friend), activities you enjoy, and much more. So here is a list in no particular order to help more:

* Pray to God or for other divine intervention like Angels. Angels really do help humans, and they tend to easily hear prayers to them (you can choose a specific one if you want, like an Archangel, like Uriel). Also just reciting a specific prayer (or good mantra/poem) out loud repeatedly, like the Lord's Prayer, can work well to get rid of spiritual pests. Guides can also be asked (just ask for a guide or more specifically one of your guides, they can hear you and come help).
* There are some things you can do physically to help spiritually clean. One I like is to burn alcohol with some salt about the home (I like the pretty blue flame). Burning sage is also a classic. \*If you can, with your mind and will, focus on the smoke (or whatever you choose) to clean your home purifying evil/bad/dark/sad/mad into light/good/happy (or whatever mental imagery works best for you).
* If you're good at projecting meditations, you might try Love. Infinite Love, like that from God, as it can scare away frightful creatures or evolve them into something better/nicer.

	In addition these entities may be of help:

* The Accord
   * Now these guys are not a great help at any given point (especially if you need immediate help). However, if you want to “file a report,” like someone hurting you (spiritually - not purely in the incarnate world), you can go to them. This is not a “good” entity, but rather strictly neutral. It believes in balance or perhaps consequences for actions (karma maybe). They are extremely thorough in their investigations and work with third parties like Angels and Demons. If you change your mind later and don’t want to press charges, they will note it down, but will not stop their investigation or eventual judgment and decisions (this includes execution of entities occasionally). Be careful, and respect these guys. They are not there to help you, but manage the Universe. Do not get in their way as they take affronts to them seriously too (mouthing off is fine, violence is not tolerated).

* Darvin
   * If you wind up in some hell dimension and don’t have any other options (again, wake up, ask for help, etc.), seek Darvin’s Clinic. He is a demon that runs a free ‘medical’ clinic to help evolve entities. He and his staff can help you, like getting you to a higher plane/dimension. You may want to tip them, but that really isn’t needed. He’s a great guy.
      * Mind you, this clinic is in a hell dimension and he is a demon with his staff being derived from his power as a demon, so they may look terrifying. Also, the patients are usually from said hell dimension, and are probably terrifying for good reason (use extreme caution with any of them, as wanting treatment at Darvin’s Clinic doesn’t mean they’re good). Be careful, but again Darvin and his staff are nice and kind (if you feel mildly scuffed up from the staff’s help, it’s probably because gentle isn’t their default with hell patients).
      * If you do go into the breakroom, stay out of the pen: the mundane translation of it contains two Roombas with knives taped onto them. Darvin says the food/drink is fine to consume, but it may be low quality compared to other spirit food you get (stale bread, cold coffee).
      * He gave me permission to list him here, but don’t chat with him if he’s busy. If you can see things, he has a really fun art gallery (paintings, sculptures, and more, usually depicting the struggle from evil to good/hell to heaven/sewers to the streets of freedom).

# Communication Help

Don’t worry there is other help out there. There are schools and humans you can talk to for tips, hints, tricks, and schooling. This is just a small guide in our incarnate Earth. However, there are spiritual entities that are useful for chatting which I will mention.

* Angels
   * *Again?* Yes. They are meant to help humans, and there are plenty of guides to pray to these entities for help. You can ask for help talking, or directly ask to talk to them. Since they are so powerful, they are easier to chat with than most entities as they can shoulder a great deal of the burden of chatting. Again though, be respectful.
* Communicators
   * These entities are as their name suggests, entities devoted to communication. There are plenty of these guys about, and they are very serious about their jobs/roles. They are very effective, but you may have to work with them for quite a while to experience improvement.
      * Be careful: if you ask for help they may not \[want to\] leave in the sense that if you are done with wanting their help and they disagree that you aren’t sufficiently good at communication yet they will still attempt to improve your communication abilities.
      * *Why do spirits need communicators?* We have plenty of mistranslations across human languages. They still occur when you can “beam” your thoughts and feelings to someone else. Perhaps you can think of them as diplomats, managing communication between entities. Although, again, the “normal” translation the Universe does is usually sufficient.
* Other Powers
   * There are other powerful entities over there that can chat, and their power lets them shoulder some of the burden of communication. Dragons come to mind for me, but if you’ve heard stories or think it might work go ahead and try it. Just be extra mindful of not getting hurt and being respectful.

* Imaginary Friends
   * *Wait a minute, these aren’t even real!* Perhaps. Although maybe not. Lots of spirit things can influence the incarnate world, like your thoughts, lighting, or the TV program you’re watching next. I had an imaginary friend that was an entity, maybe yours is too. Maybe not though. Enough conversation with a specific one may invite a spirit into that imaginary friend (humans don’t generally have the power to make spirits/life). *Could this be dangerous?* Probably not, but do be careful as some spirits are devious and may play tricks on you. Especially be careful of inviting them into your home.

* House Spirits
   * *Are these easy to talk with?* Not especially. However, your home probably has a few wandering around. One benefit of these guys is that you know they already somewhat like you, as they live with you voluntarily. They’ll most likely enjoy talking with you. Maybe not though.
      * Be extra nice to these guys. Since you do share space with them you do not want them upset with you. They probably won’t do extensive damage, but they can roll up their sleeves and get you in a million different ways.
      * My current House Spirit is insisting that ALL house spirits would love to talk with their human housemates, but that is a small sample size.
      * *What do they look like?* Well, one house I was in they were mostly cats because the humans had had a lot of cats and loved them. My current house spirit looks more like a regal Surinam toad. So the short answer is they can look like anything (like all spiritual entities) but probably lean more towards something the home would be comfortable with (the home including you presumably).

# Guides

	Guides can help out as well. These tend to be spirits that are based around helping in some sort of way or fashion. There are many of them that range across a wide assortment of help. You most likely already have quite a few. Just be careful as they can be temperamental, and their help may not align with the help you want. It may be easiest to call upon them/find them in the control room of your Damo’s Cave.

# Dead

	*Can I contact the dead?* Yes, but they may not be the same as you remember them. They may not want to talk to you either. ‘Complete’ souls can have multiple incarnate lives, or may not resemble humans. I know for most of my lives I was a snake, and I really haven’t had that many as human, so I probably don’t look like I do now over there or talk/act exactly like the me on Earth now. That is fine. There is nothing wrong with that, or whatever anyone else is. They are still them, just more.

*Can I use them to “confirm” things?* As for “confirming” things over there from them, the best advice I have ever heard is: “Just because they are dead, that doesn’t make them smart.” I mean, I talked with a dead priest (no idea on the denomination, but my guess is Christian) who absolutely thought faith was important. Faith. A dead guy insisting on… faith. I mean, if you’re dead, you \*already\* know, but what have you. Besides, “over there” is vast beyond imagine, anything that could exist probably does so if you want something specific it probably exists already. That also means you can “agree with the narrative” or… not. Don’t get tied to “the truth” for that is probably only a small part of the world over there.

	*Any advice for when I die?* Yeah, don’t get trapped on Earth. I’ve seen it before, a sad soul who thought the afterlife was a bug or error or something, and just sat at his grave to protect the world from himself. Don’t do that to yourself, pass over. Get help if needed, but trust me when I say there is plenty of help for dead souls to cross over. Also, if you’re afraid to rejoin the rest of yourself: A) that is still you and B) you don’t have to (but I personally recommend rejoining).

# Writer

	That’s me! Hello! Please do not reach out to me to chat, or my higher self, or my higher self in training. DM’s are okay through reddit where this should be posted...

	*Why so much focus on Angels?* Well, right now I’m in constant cahoots with one, and we like our friendly relationship. He thought other Angels would like an incarnate human to talk to (find your own, he has enough on his hands), and recommended I put in a recommendation to chat with Angels. Also, in general, Angels really are there to help humans. Mind you, even if you become “friends” with an Angel they’ll probably still regard you in a similar way as us humans regard frogs, cats, dogs, or butterflies. In a sense, they are a “Cthulian horror” beyond our understanding: immortal, powerful beyond our measure, existing in a different plane of reality, and having form and shape unfamiliar to anything incarnate. That being said, they still tend to appear much more “normal” or human-like for us. If you ever feel like a giant eyeball is staring at you when talking to an Angel (or other large powerful entities) it's probably just reflective of relative size: if we look at a small insect up close for detail, it’ll really only see our singular eyeball too.

	*Do you get hurt?* I was actually spiritually hurt while making this guide, LOL. It was mostly my fault though, as I am a stubborn idiot. I’m being helped by some Angels, but it is still taking time.

	*Do you translate for others?* Talk for entities? Yes, occasionally. For me, I “generate” a fractal to possess me and then that talks, although I’m always in control (so I sometimes limit their speech if I disagree, like them wanting to curse which I don’t do). They aren’t bound against their will (some will not do this at all, and some will refuse if I’m unwell as they don’t want to feel sick/that), but occasionally I will hear thoughts they didn’t mean to or want to share with me. It is weird doing this as they have different tastes too, as some like food and drink I don’t and vice versa. Just do yourself a favor and don’t eat meat with “higher” entities unless they’re using you to protect themselves as they have a STRONG revulsion to meat. Other people have philosophized on why they don’t like meat, but I’ll leave that to them as I enjoy the benefits of my meat heavy diet (Keto diet for Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus help, whooo).

	That is my guide. Good luck, and remember: time, patience, practice, and finding what works best for you. Stay safe and have some good chats!",1,1742005890.0,u_ZippoAdgeKvaz,0,1.0,False

1jbl1xx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1jbl1xx/6_food_helped_me_lose_40_lbs_after_years_of/,6 food helped me lose 40 lbs after years of struggling,"I stepped on the scale a couple days ago, and for the first time in years, I saw a number I’m proud of: 71kg (156 lbs). A “normal” BMI. Body fat at 17%. Two years ago, I was obese (BMI 31), living off pizza and cookie dough ice cream like it was a personality trait. I ruined my 20-year-old body, and I hated looking in the mirror. But today, I feel different. Lighter. Healthier. Not just physically, but mentally.

I wasted so much time on dumb fitness trends, pointless supplements, and ""magic"" diets that never worked. But when I finally cracked the code, everything changed. Losing weight wasn’t about suffering through endless workouts or cutting every carb - it was about getting smarter with my food and training. 80% diet, 20% exercise. And these were the foods that made it possible:

**- Oatmeal - basic but undefeated. Filling, healthy, and fixed my digestion.**

**- Chicken breast - obviously.**

**- Vegetables (i like tomatoes) - eat them, they matter.**

**- Protein shakes - easy, convenient, and great mixed with oats.**

**- Black coffee & tea - appetite control and energy boost in one.**

**- Protein bread - if you love bread but hate the carbs, this is the hack.**

Of course, food alone didn’t fix my mindset. Losing weight was just as much a mental battle as a physical one. My biggest breakthrough? Therapy. I didn’t want to admit I needed it, but my anxiety around food, exercise, and self-worth wasn’t going to solve itself. Here’s what actually helped me rewire my brain:

\- **Your thoughts lie to you. The fear of “failing” a diet is worse than actually messing up. One bad meal won’t ruin you. Obsessing over perfection will.**

**- Willpower is overrated. Habits and environment matter more. If you have junk food everywhere, you’ll eat it. Make your default choices healthy.**

**- Food guilt is pointless. You’re not “bad” for eating a cookie. The key is consistency, not punishment.**

My therapist also threw a bunch of book recs at me, and honestly, reading these changed everything. If you are in the same situation, these books are the next best thing:

**-** [**Grain Brain**](https://befreed.ai/book/grain-brain-by-david-perlmutter/heart) **by David Perlmutter (Your brain might be addicted to the wrong foods)**

This book made me question everything I thought i knew about carbs. The author talks about how processed grains and sugars can mess with your brain, mood, and weight. If you’ve ever felt like your cravings are controlling you, this is a must-read.

**-** [**Burn**](https://befreed.ai/book/burn-by-herman-pontzer/heart) **by Herman Pontzer (You can’t outwork a bad diet)**

This book completely changed how I see calories and metabolism. Pontzer, an evolutionary anthropologist, studied hunter-gatherer tribes and found that our bodies adapt to burn a set amount of calories no matter how much we move. It explains why exercise alone isn’t enough for fat loss - and why diet is king. Insanely eye-opening read.

**-** [**Built to Move**](https://befreed.ai/book/built-to-move-by-kelly-starrett/heart) **by Kelly & Juliet Starrett (Make fitness sustainable)**

 A practical guide on how to move better, feel stronger, and prevent injuries. Helped me fix my form and mobility issues.

**- The Joy of Half a Cookie by Jean Kristeller (Stop emotional eating)**

If you’ve ever felt out of control around food, this book is a must-read. It teaches mindful eating techniques that actually work (no, it’s not just “eat slower”).

**- The Diet Fix by Yoni Freedhoff (Ditch all-or-nothing thinking)**

This book is for anyone who’s ever felt like they “failed” a diet. It’s all about breaking the cycle of restrictive eating and learning how to eat in a way you can sustain forever.

Looking back, I wish I had figured all this out sooner. The weight loss industry thrives on confusion, but the truth is simple: eat mostly whole foods, move consistently, and fix your mindset. If you’re struggling, I promise you’re not alone - but you have to take the first step. And if you don’t know where to start? Read. Learning about nutrition and psychology made all the difference for me. Hope it helps you too.",16,1742005491.0,Adulting,7,0.91,False

It's a very tragic fate. My Grandfather (her son) is in his late 70's currently. I don't talk to him very often, but my mother reaches out to him weekly and she seems to believe he is also experiencing some form of cognitive decline, asking her questions that he has already asked a bunch of times and such (though this short-term forgetfulness is not exactly uncommon in men his age and certainly not indicative of something serious). My personal inclination is that his lifestyle choices may have held off dementia to some degree. He owns his own piece of land in the Midwest and is constantly coming up with his own personal projects to improve upon it, such as building a fishing pond, building a well and this or that and the other, thus making him constantly physically active in his old age rather than just sitting around all day. He also reads voraciously and does logic puzzles like crossword and sudoku, which I am sure keeps his brain active instead of just watching tv or something. While I think these things have all definitely helped him, obviously what causes and prevents Alzheimer's/dementia has much more nuance to it. It also has made me terrified that I may one day experience this myself. I would hate for my children and grandchildren to have to see me in such a state where I don't even know them or who I am while shitting in diapers.

Like are you supposed to go ""ahh, stress gone""?","I'm still thinking about her. Quite daily, actually. We work like 25 minutes away from each other and she doesn't miss a month to walk past my work. In the beginning, she left me so confused, I thought about her every second of every day. I *needed* to see her. 5 months later, I *needed* to get over her. I would spend entire days just walking because that was the only thing that could get my mind off the obsession. 7 months later, I noticed I barely style my hair. 9 months later, therapy. 12 months later, could see my scalp. During this year, I was on living on takeout ramen and surprisingly, I forgot what I would eat for dinner. I don't remember if I ordered takeout for dinner or if I cooked at home every day. I know I cooked at home, but I don't remember what, which is scary. I had coffee every hour in between, perhaps 12 shots of espresso a day.

By late December 2024, I fixed my diet. By January 2025, stress ""began getting better"". I stopped walking those long walks and began going back to just doing what I used to do (although still thinking about her). Obsession would return every few weeks as I struggled to find back to who I was.

Now it's March. I still think and wonder about her, whether she'll walk past, but I no longer take those walks and I'm entirely back to doing what I used to do. I've still not found back socially. Still not making new connections. Still stuck in the past, but I'm not as panicky as I used to be. Occasionally, I'll reconsider hitting up the therapist for deeper questions about this whole episode, but it's not as acute as it used to be.
