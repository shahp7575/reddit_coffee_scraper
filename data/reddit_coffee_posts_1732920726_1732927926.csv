Not just that, he's very kind, considerate, sweet and smart and I can see myself dating him. However I met him 6 days ago and he's coming on wayyyy too strong. I met him Sunday and he asked to get coffee for an hour Tuesday, then after I went home he asked if I wanted to come over. I did and hangout for a bit then went home. The next day he asked to come over when I was sick (he brought what I said was my favourite snacks) and we spent the day at my house together.

It was chill and I liked seeing him... but it has been 4 times in 4 days. On top of that, he told me he missed me today (I saw him all day yesterday), and he told me he told his mom about me (sent me screenshots of his showing his mom photos from my social media) and sent me a song called ""I was born to love you"" and said I would like it.... like definitely strange considering I met him not even a week ago. Is this a big red flag, even though in person he's very chill and sweet? If it is a red flag, can you please tell me why cause idk",1,1732927782.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I feel like such a failure. I got let go from two jobs this year, I’m currently working in a minimum wage job. I got into a car crash this year so I have no car and I’m staying paying off my loan for it. I can’t afford to get a new one. I only had the car for a year so I still have a good bit to pay. I work a lot but still only come out with a small bit of money each week. I live paycheck to paycheck and struggling with money. My anxiety gets worse and worse everyday and I know that I have undiagnosed adhd. Everything is getting too much. I’m getting treated awfully in my current job. I feel like I’m going absolutely no where in life. I have zero friends besides my boyfriend. I feel so fucking alone. I envy people who have friends, and see them out having fun. I want that. I spend most of my free time if I’m not with my bf alone. There’s so many fun things I want to do but get sad that I’ve no one to do them with. I want to go to concerts with friends, night outs, brunch, coffee days, be able to FaceTime and talk to one another and laugh. I’m finding things really hard. I’ve always wanted a bestfriend. I’ve always wanted to experience that. My boyfriend is my best friend. But I want an actual bestfriend. Just the way he has a bestfriend. I hate how I look, and I hate being me. I can’t even look at myself in the mirror. I’m such a failure in everything and I’m so ashamed to be me. Each day I’m getting more and more fed up of life. know people have things so much worse than me and I’m still grateful that I’ve a warm home to come home too, and food, and a bed so I am very lucky. I’m just struggling and struggling each day, I have since a teenager. On my days off I stay in bed all day, I don’t come out of my room, my room is so messy, I have no energy to clean it, I’ve started to leave myself go in my appearance. I used to make an effort, but I don’t see a point anymore when I hate myself so much. I’m sorry this post is kinda all over the place. I’m just frantic and upset as I type this.

These days however, I feel like I'm trying to extend as much life out of everything I own despite having the funds to easily go out and replace it.

*Computer keyboard doesn't work sometimes?  Just smack it on the desk a few times and it'll work again.*

*Coffee machine stops brewing in the morning?  Just stand beside it and keep restarting it until it goes all the way through.*

The list goes on for a few more items, but it's little small stuff like that that.

I always think about my dad who had a very healthy finances, yet he'd drive his old car that he used to have crawl through the passenger door to get into cause the driver door wouldn't open.  Not very safe now that I look back, but his motto whenever I said why don't you replace it was... ""it still works!""

I'm not sure what my question is, but I guess I'm wondering if anyone else has become similar in how they try to squeeze as much life out of something as they can.",1,1732927689.0,AskMenOver30,0,1.0,False

1h30hmz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h30hmz,In-laws and insufficient overcurrent protection ,"Two duplex receptacles sit on a 20A AF GF branch circuit shared with only the microwave, newly installed panel and service upgrade. Not sure what it was before because it wasn’t labeled but I imagine it was a 20A. Appears to be white 12 gauge romex mixed with new yellow 12 gauge romex. In-laws have been using the electric kettle a lot and the microwave at the same time plus coffee grinder.

Original configuration appears to show the line side hot and neutral feeding into top screw of first duplex receptacle and the bottom screw is double tapped feeding to the microwave and the second duplex receptacle.

Receptacle died and was tripping the AF breaker, resetting doesn’t work presumably because the receptacle melted/died.

I cut back the wires to where the sheathing was no longer burnt and pulled out both receptacles. I got 2 new 15 amp receptacles and pigtailed the line-side wire, the to-microwave wire, and the to-first-receptacle wire. Then fed the second receptacle from the bottom screw of the first receptacle. Does this new configuration make sense?

I used 12/2, j hooks oriented in clockwise direction, and wire nuts rated for proper number and gauge of wires according to the box. Other than having better j hooks, anything that would’ve been better here?

Thank you. I’ve yet to flip the breaker back on because I’d like to get the opinion of people who know more than me.",1,1732927604.0,AskElectricians,1,1.0,False

1h30e2d,https://www.reddit.com/r/HertzRentals/comments/1h30e2d/say_no_to_ev_rentals_a_cautionary_tale/,Say no to EV rentals: a Cautionary Tale,"I made the mistake of choosing the ""dealer's choice"" option when booking on Expedia.  Picked up a car in Seattle to drive to Portland for Thanksgiving dinner with some old friends.  Granted I did come in late for my reservation, but naively I believed I had a car reserved for the entire time so I could pick it up at my convenience within that window.  

When I came in, the rate was almost double what it had been quoted on Expedia when I booked.  When I calmly pointed this out it was a lengthy process of readjusting the booking to match the original quote.   There was also a surprise $500 deposit when I used a debit card--I had expected a small deposit however $500 seems quite high for a 2-day booking considering I had also opted into the third-party full-coverage insurance.

I mentioned that I was driving to Portland.  They gave me a Chevy Bolt EV.  

""Wow, cool,"" I thought. I had never driven an EV before.  My last car was a manual 86 Volvo DL, which I loved literally to death.  

The driving is intuitive enough, and conveniently there was an estimated mileage displayed on the dash.  The car it turns out was only charged to run 73 miles.  I thought oh no biggie, equating this to something like a 3/8 tank of gas like it was marked on the key fob.  

Well... this is how the nightmare began.  I stopped in Tukwila south of Seattle off of I-5 to charge.  It took me a minute to figure out wtf was going on as out of 6 charging stations in the lot, 4 were missing charging cables and were out of service.  ""Strange anomoly!"" I thought.  I began charging thinking I'd have a full tank in what? 20 minutes?  

Nope.  It takes 85 minutes to charge from 30% to 80%.  Why 80%?  Because the design for these cars is not exactly a perfected technology and unless you want to wait another hour or two, everything and everyone on the internet says to charge to 80%, even the car and the charger.  

Okay so I looked up the range of the car and it's close to 300 miles, but as I was quickly learning, that's just some happy marketing bs for an ideal situation that does not exist.  

I mapped out directions to my destination and charged it up to have an extra 15 or 20 miles so that ai'd be able to charge again on my way out. Called my friends and explained what was happening and why I'd be a bit late. No big deal, I would still make it for Thanksgiving dinner with friends I had not seen in years.

So I start driving.  I notice there is a ring around the mileage estimate and speedometer that turns from green to yellow between 65mph and the posted speed limit 70 mph.  ""Hmm that must be the rpms!"" I think to myself.  

But no. See. The mileage estimate began draining rapidly. The ""minimum"" projected mileage began draining. These cars are not built for highway driving.  They're built for short and slow city driving.  I ended up having to stop in Lacey near Olympia when I realized I would not make it to Portland on the charge I had.  I had charged at a Shell station in Tukwila so I pulled off at a Shell station again.  There was indeed a Shell Charge point in Lacey, but not at the Shell station. It was another 10-minute drive away in the middle of no where. And it wasn't a Shell station it was a PSE Electric Utility charge station. So joy of joys I got to download another app, give another app all of my personal and payment information, and then they insisted that I fill a ""wallet"" instead of just charging me for what I used like at a gas pump. Okay, WHATEVER! Still feeling in the spirit of the holiday I took some deep breaths and let the thing charge again.

After 30 minutes or so I was back up to about 20 miles estimated over my range, and a line was forming to use the chargers. I thought, ""Okay surely I have enough. In the spirit of Thanksgiving (stupid naive little dunce that I am) I'll let the lady behind me go"" as she was futilely trying to connect to the Chad-something-something cable on the same charger. 

""Are you sure?"" she asked.

""Oh yeah I have plenty! Happy Thanksgiving!""

And so I set off again.  Listening to the lilting piano compositions of Emahoy Tsege Mariam Gebrou, I cursed a little about why this was so much more of a hassle than the AAA Gig hybrid cars that I had loved so much until they were recently taken out of service and had a creeping doubt that in total they really have a net positive environmental impact.  

There is a stretch of I-5 between Centralia and Vancouver where there isn't much to speak of. Some small towns and a few gas stations.  Here as the sun began to set my rental car beeped at me and said ""charge soon"".  Now I was getting mad. 

I stopped in a town called Woodland and did a quick map search for a charger. It took 20 minutes of driving to find it, and when I did it looked a little... out of order. It was a BP charger at an Am/pm gas station. So another app. Yes, the app confirmed that indeed the whole station was out of order. In fact, there were no fast chargers available in the area.

Haha. Ha. Ha.  Now I was cursing quite a bit.  It was dark.  I was now 3 hours late. And I still had to charge this mf pos again.  I didn't have enough charge to make it to Vancouver, WA where I saw the next closest ""fast"" charger was. But I saw some chargers in a nearby town callled Ridgeland, and I had just enough mileage to make it.  

By the time I pulled into Ridgeland, I found the chargint station halfway across town. It was in a grocery store parking lot and the chargers were attached to advertisement panels that were lit up with weekly deals.  But surprise! Out of order, all of them.  A store employee offered a locally friendly, ""yeah they don't work. Good luck!"" 

I located another set of chargers that strangely were behind the public library allll the way across the municipality. When I started to driv again the car warned me of reduced acceleration, running on ""fumes"". Well. These finally worked (with another app and more information) but they put my charging time at a wopping 10 hours.  Yes. The ""fast"" chargers are turbo charged at 90 minutes conpared to municipal chargers using washer/dryer lines to power a modern vehicle. 

So I cried in my car for a while as the battery refilled at a snail's pace.  Fortunately there was a park nearby with a lookout on the misty Pacific Northwest twilight and a portapotty for me to relieve myself.  I breathed on a bench and answered my friends' worried messages promising to tell them my tale when I finally arrived. After another 30 minutes of absurdly slow recharging I had enough to crawl to Vancouver and plug into a ""fast"" charger again.

Even in Vancouver, three of six charging stations were out of order and fortunately someone was pulling out just as I pulled in.  I charged another 35 minutes, now well over 4 hours late and arrived in time to eat cold leftovers, play a card game, say goodnight to everyone, and have a cup of coffee with my friend in the morning before he left for work. 

I missed Thanksgiving dinner.

Now I charged the car up to 80% on my way out of Portland this morning, which took 90 minutes. I got to Lacey again and saw that again the estimated mileage dropped rapidly and had to stop to recharge AGAIN. Another 90 minutes, which puts me rather late for my drop-off.  The trip from Seattle to Portland is usually 3 hours.  An EV makes it easily 5.5-8 depending on how lucky you get with whether chargers are available or indeed even operating.

What I learned as I angrily searched the internet for answers is that funding exists to install chargint stations but not to maintain them.  My friend who works for a car dealership says that out of 4 charging stations they ordered, 3 arrived non-functioning and the dealership had to lobby the city for months to allocate them the extra electricity.  He told me they've had to refund customers for cars whose batteries died before leaving the lot.

Ya'll. I wanted to believe in EV's. But they're kind of trash garbage.  They may be FINE for city driving and if you have infrastructure and planning at home to manage the power.  But mf my ADHD ass just cannot.  And you know, what the hell. I honestly feel outright scammed renting a car for 48 hours and not knowing I'd have to spend 6-8 of those hours sitting in a parking lot waiting for it to charge. It would have been nice to know the mileage wasn't enough to reach my stated destination on one charge.

Frankly this ruined my holiday and my friends' holiday. Won't be using Hertz again and 100% will not be using EV's again until the technology and infrastructure improve... and I sure as shit am not holding my breath on that one.",1,1732927307.0,HertzRentals,0,1.0,False

Hi! I am looking primarily for friendship, potentially open to more if it occurs naturally, but not searching for anything more specifically. 

A bit about the type of person I’m looking for: 
I live in western Canada, so a similar time zone to that would be ideal(exact same time zone not necessary, any North American time zone is close enough). I am looking for someone aged 30+(this is a hard boundary). Does not expect constant/instant replies. I would like there to be daily communication, but I’m not constantly glued to my phone. I am looking for someone that is willing and able to put effort into conversation(I will do the same). I am looking for someone kind, fun, maybe a little bit funny, and genuine. Other than that, I’m very open to most other things and am not looking for a specific “type” of person! I’m looking for friendship first and foremost, but wouldn’t be opposed to it if the friendship evolved into something a bit more flirty/feelings develop. That being said, I’m not *looking* for something serious, nor do I have any intention of relocating or anything like that. 



A bit about me/some general interests: 

I love to listen to music, my favorite band since I was 15 lol is Blink 182(have seen them live three times). I like to watch movies and tv shows(who doesn’t?) - I’m definitely a horror girly, but I like other things too! I love ghosts and fall.  I love to shop and get my nails done. I’m a little obsessed with Jellycats. Also a little obsessed with Bobs Burgers.  I love coffee. I’m very close with my family, we spend a lot of time together. I like to try and stay active, and get at least a bit of exercise daily. 
Here are a couple photos of me https://imgur.com/a/5P3SHJq


If you think this sounds like something you’d be interested in, please contact me(chat preferred over DM). Please only message me if you are going to include some context - tell me about yourself, start a conversation based on something I’ve mentioned in my post, it’s up to you but I will likely not spend any effort on “hey” or smalltalk responses.

The key to success in this game is through having thick skin and being tough. It is about hanging on for dear life, through all the dips, through all the noise and not fading at the critical moments.

An opportunity like SHIB was presented to so many people and yet they faded.

It is important to look at the current market through an objective scope. Alt season has not yet begun, BTC.D is still peaking, and even now as of writing the market is going through a small correction. Barely any alts are moving, and those FEW that do are through insider trading and cabals. Ultimately, the only way to win in this game is with community.

Here in $KENDU I know we have the best community in DeFi and that is just fact. I also know, the way to win is through work, time and effort.

I know I do not want to be the person who looks back in the future and goes.. ""I faded kendu, i could have had millions""

We have so many things in the future for KENDU, but i feel it is unimportant to focus in these when in front of us we already have the key to our success; the community. Kendu is placing itself in pole position for the upcoming alt season in 2025. We are maximising our output, engagement and work through sheer organic dedication. As a community, we are closing in on the 50 000 certik votes completely organically. Yes, we could have paid for it, why though? We have demonstrated the capacity of how our community can chip away at any monsterous feat.

Right now we are planting crops, we are sewing the fields and working. Showing up every day in every single way. We are out there as a community, IRL shilling, getting IRL branding, doing everything in our output to ensure the success of $KENDU

We have things such as energy drinks, kendu coffee, jewellery and even protein powder / creatine on the whey. We have chads jumping out of planes, even tattooing their reproduction organs through the name of kendu conviction.

This community is more than just a coin. It is a movement. A brand. An opportunity to learn from so many experienced OG Shib holders and long time crypto investors. A canvas that so many community members are using to propel their own initiatives forward, using the Kendu canvas as an opportunity to paint their dreams.

We are running this up even better then Shib did in 2020/21. We are a perpetual, multi-cycle movement. There is no better chance in all of DeFi then here at kendu for 2025 at winning.

So, will you join the movement anon?

We have things such as energy drinks, kendu coffee, jewellery and even protein powder / creatine on the whey. We have chads jumping out of planes, even tattooing their reproduction organs through the name of kendu conviction.

This community is more than just a coin. It is a movement. A brand. An opportunity to learn from so many experienced OG Shib holders and long time crypto investors. A canvas that so many community members are using to propel their own initiatives forward, using the Kendu canvas as an opportunity to paint their dreams.

We are running this up even better then Shib did in 2020/21. We are a perpetual, multi-cycle movement. There is no better chance in all of DeFi then here at kendu for 2025 at winning.

So, will you join the movement anon?

1h309aj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tik_tok_stories/comments/1h309aj/a_niagara_vacation/,A Niagara vacation,"
 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

Do you ever wonder why you hear so many stories about people having been presented the opportunity of Shib or Doge that then soon faded and jeeted right before the run up?

My $2000 went down to $1000 so I had to sell! if only I didnt it would have been worth 2.3mil!

Do you think these people would have sold if Shib went up in only a straight line?

The key to success in this game is through having thick skin and being tough. It is about hanging on for dear life, through all the dips, through all the noise and not fading at the critical moments.

An opportunity like SHIB was presented to so many people and yet they faded.

It is important to look at the current market through an objective scope. Alt season has not yet begun, BTC.D is still peaking, and even now as of writing the market is going through a small correction. Barely any alts are moving, and those FEW that do are through insider trading and cabals. Ultimately, the only way to win in this game is with community.

Here in $KENDU I know we have the best community in DeFi and that is just fact. I also know, the way to win is through work, time and effort.

I know I do not want to be the person who looks back in the future and goes.. ""I faded kendu, i could have had millions""

I live in Kansas City, but I've spent most of my life in the NYC metro. I moved here in 2015 for a great job, and I've been here since. I live alone in a nice, modern home in the South Hyde Park area. I love living inside the city and don't see myself living far away from an urban area.

I'm handsome, slim, and in great shape. I have deep, dark eyes and dark hair peppered with greys. I keep my facial hair short and well-groomed. I don't currently have any tattoos or piercings.

I pass regular background checks due to my job so you know I'm not shady. I have no debt or unpaid bills. I'm not addicted to anything. I don't need to be taught basic adult skills like how to care for myself or my home. You won't have to pick up after me or take an overwhelming share of the mental load. I've even kept my plants alive for years! Hopefully, you've got stability and minimal drama in your life. Ideally, you're independent and have a job that you enjoy. 

Politically, I'm a very passionate progressive/liberal. If you have some ""conservative"" values, that may not necessarily be a source of conflict. However, if you're a supporter of the modern Republican party and the MAGA movement, we are not a good fit. I'm not a religious person, but it is okay if you are as long as you can accept that I am not. Lastly, I do not have children and would prefer to date someone without children or whose kids are older and independent.

Except for a fulfilling relationship with a loving partner, I have a happy and comfortable life that doesn't want for anything. I'm capable, confident, independent, and have my life together. I want to meet someone with the intent of developing an enduring relationship. We can proceed at a pace that makes sense for us.

-------------------------
**Some things I enjoy:**

* **Food**: I have a very adventurous palate and love trying new foods. I avoid eating at the same restaurant twice to force myself to broaden my food experiences. If you're a vegan/vegetarian, that's fine! I'm open to the idea of some version of vegetarianism myself. I'm a competent cook, but I don't enjoy cooking. I'd prefer a partner who does. I promise that I'm great at doing the dishes and cleaning up in the kitchen.

* **Fitness**: My health is important, especially as I get older. I exercise regularly and also run. I'd love someone who prioritizes their health and fitness as well.

* **Coffee**: My COVID project was learning to appreciate coffee. My home ""cafe"" looks like a meth lab. I love it. I'll make you a great, fresh cup of pour-over in the morning. 

* **Riding**: I own a modern-retro scooter (a la Vespa) and enjoy riding it around the city. Don't worry, you do not need to get on the scooter if you don't want to. I promise I ride safely and with proper gear, and never speed or get on the highway.

* **Therapy**: I have been seeing a therapist for about half a year, and I'm finding it invaluable. After my previous relationships failed, I felt it was important to work on myself and set up future relationships for success. I think everyone would benefit from therapy at various points in their life.

* **Politics**: I'm a ""political junkie"". I frequently read articles and listen to podcasts. I also have a great deal of interest in the Supreme Court.

* **Movies**: I'm a huge cinephile and enjoy going to the theater. 

* **Music**: I love live music. I'm tolerant of most genres but gravitate towards indie, pop, and EDM. I like discovering new music, so if you want to share something you're vibing to and think I might like it, please share it with me.

* **Gaming**: I love to play board games with a group or my partner. I especially like games that involve some sort of social component and intuition, like The Resistance. Going out for trivia nights at bars is also one of my favorite things to do. I sometimes play single-player video games that allow me to stop at any time.

* **Cleanliness**: I'm probably the tidiest man you'll ever meet. I keep both my home and myself tidy. I'm something of a minimalist as well. I am not a big fan of collecting tons of trinkets and knickknacks and would not do well with a hoarder.

* **Drugs**: I have no dependencies or addictions whatsoever. I only drink socially and in moderation. I don't smoke *anything*, and I don't want to date someone who smokes a lot of anything. It smells gross and makes you taste gross. I sometimes enjoy a low-dose edible or a psychedelic. It's okay with me if you casually enjoy alcohol, marijuana, or ""lighter"" drugs more often than I do. 

* **Traveling**: I'm more of a homebody, but I like road trips. I want to drive across the country in a camper someday. I enjoy hiking and ""glamping"", but don't love prolonged camping. I would be agreeable to traveling far and wide with a partner.

It is perfectly fine if you don't share all my interests. I want you to be your own person with your own passions. As long as we align on our core values and ideals, the rest is not all that important.

------------
Please be serious about meeting in person. I don't want to text endlessly. If you're interested, feel free to reach out to me via chat or Reddit mail (preferred). **Please include a picture of your face with your message and describe yourself physically**. It's not much different than if we were on a dating app. I **will** ask for a picture if you didn't include one to start. Being weird about this would lead me to believe you're not serious and I'll likely move on.

------------
If you're **long-distance** (i.e. more than 2 hours away) and still interested, feel free to message me, but *only if* you're willing to make an actual effort to meet me in person after chatting for a bit. Ideally, you're in a position where you'll be able to relocate to Kansas City to live with me in a hypothetical future in which we're both committed to one another.

As a community, we are closing in on the 50 000 certik votes completely organically. Yes, we could have paid for it, why though? We have demonstrated the capacity of how our community can chip away at any monsterous feat.

Right now we are planting crops, we are sewing the fields and working. Showing up every day in every single way. We are out there as a community, IRL shilling, getting IRL branding, doing everything in our output to ensure the success of $KENDU

We have things such as energy drinks, kendu coffee, jewellery and even protein powder / creatine on the whey. We have chads jumping out of planes, even tattooing their reproduction organs through the name of kendu conviction.

This community is more than just a coin. It is a movement. A brand. An opportunity to learn from so many experienced OG Shib holders and long time crypto investors. A canvas that so many community members are using to propel their own initiatives forward, using the Kendu canvas as an opportunity to paint their dreams.

We are running this up even better then Shib did in 2020/21. We are a perpetual, multi-cycle movement. There is no better chance in all of DeFi then here at kendu for 2025 at winning.

So, will you join the movement anon?

1h2zusb,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlinePsychic/comments/1h2zusb/are_psychics_real/,Are Psychics Real?,"I never considered myself someone who’d visit a psychic. Sure, I enjoyed watching movies about mind-readers and loved a good ghost story, but paying someone to tell me about my life? It felt, well, unnecessary. That was until my friend Rachel booked us both a session as a “fun experience” for her birthday. She insisted, “You’ll love it!” and who was I to rain on her parade?

So, there I was, sitting across from a psychic in a cozy, incense-filled room, feeling skeptical but curious. She was warm and calm, and before I could even utter a word, she looked me straight in the eye and said, “You’ve been dreaming about your grandfather lately, haven’t you?”

My heart skipped. She was right. For weeks, I’d been having these vivid dreams about my grandfather, who passed away years ago. We’d sit together in those dreams, just like we used to, chatting over coffee. I hadn’t mentioned this to anyone—not even Rachel. It felt too random and personal to bring up.

I nodded, stunned, and she continued, “He’s been trying to tell you something. There’s a project you’ve put off—a story, perhaps? He wants you to finish it.”

Now, here’s where it gets eerie. My grandfather was the family storyteller, and years ago, I had started writing a short story based on one of his wild adventures. But life got busy, and I left it unfinished in a notebook buried in my desk. How could she have known that?

Feeling both weirded out and intrigued, I went home and dug through my desk until I found the dusty notebook. The story was half-written, but as I read through it, I felt this overwhelming urge to finish it. Over the next few weeks, I worked on it in my free time, remembering my grandfather’s humor and how much he loved sharing his tales. When I finally completed the story, it felt like a gift—not just to him, but to myself.

So, are psychics real? I’m still not sure if she connected with my grandfather’s spirit or just read something in my energy that led her there. What I do know is that her words nudged me toward finishing something meaningful, and for that, I’ll always be grateful.

Here’s the thing about psychics: they’re not all crystal balls and fortune cookies. The good ones, in my experience, seem to tap into a mix of intuition, observation, and maybe something more. Whether they truly “see” or simply help you see yourself better, the result can be powerful.

If you’re considering visiting a psychic, go in with an open mind but realistic expectations. They’re not magicians, but sometimes, they’ll give you exactly what you didn’t realize you needed. Worst-case scenario? You leave with a quirky story. Best case? You reconnect with a part of yourself you’d forgotten—like finishing an old story and honoring someone you love.",1,1732925698.0,OnlinePsychic,0,1.0,False

1h2znwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnycubicPhoton/comments/1h2znwo/detailed_questions_from_newbie_after_reading/,Detailed questions from newbie- after reading resource guide,"Hey guys!  
  
I’m pretty sure I’m going to be getting an ANYCUBIC Photon Mono M7 resin printer for my birthday, with the ANYCUBIC high speed grey resin. 

I’ve read through just about every guide for setting up a resin printer and getting started, and I’m completely overwhelmed with all the information. Between leveling vats, setting up FEP screens, running test prints, fiddling with settings- I’m unclear on what I actually really, really need to do to get it working. 

So, here are my questions\~

Firstly, is there just a **really simple** list of the things that need to be done to get the printer working smoothly, from start to finish? As I mentioned, every guide I read had a different way of explaining things and it’s pretty overwhelming. So far, I can tell that I need to set up the FEP, build plate, etc, but then which test prints do I run? I’ve seen like seventy variants all saying that my printer will basically implode if I don’t run them, and haven’t found a clear, comprehensive list of all the things that need to be done to set up the printer. 

Secondly, does anyone know the recommended settings for the printer / resin type I’m using (listed above)? I looked on all the spreadsheets but couldn’t find this particular type of resin listed. My plan is basically to start with the basic settings that work, then once I’ve got a hang of the basics, start tweaking them based on what I need.

Third, when it comes to cleaning the FEP sheet, can you just clean it using a cotton ball and IPA? And is 80% IPA good or do you absolutely need higher? And with used IPA, I saw someone say that a good way to reuse it is to leave it in the sunlight to cure any resin bits, strain it with a coffee filter, and then throw out the resin bits. Is this a good method, or is there a better one? And I’ve seen people saying that their wash/cure station cleans their build plate- is the build plate actually removable? Or do you need to clean it separately, and if so, does cotton ball / IPA work?

Finally, for preventing screen drips, do you *need* to buy a screen protector, or would tape and seran wrap work in a pinch? Do most splashes occur when the build plate is raising / lowering, or is it meant to protect from big leaks? (Probably gonna pick up a screen protector at some point, but until then, need to know if I can jerry-rig something temporary).

1h2zlxo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adelaide/comments/1h2zlxo/first_speeding_fine_ever/,First speeding fine ever,"Hi all,

I'm hoping to get an advice from nice people who have been in a similar situation. Im not here to get judged so please just be nice. And i hope you support me with some nice words as  i currently think I have no one to lean on to at the moment.

Originally from Melbourne was here in SA for work by myself for 2 weeks on some regional runs and i had to do long regional drives for work in those long straight roads in the middle of nowhere. Two days ago i had to do a 4hrs drive and was just carried away by my music and having peacful drive (road was a 110km limit). Then unfortunately i was pulled over by a cop who came out of no where on the opposite side and apparently I was speeding.I don't even know how I ended up speeding, i really don't know. I'm still thinking about it and telling myself "" how and why..."". I just don't know why I pressed this pedal for no reason without realising. Now I did want to get to my other work site to make it on-time and felt some pressure on the way and i dont know why I was thinking I'm running late, even tho i was not. I still think I had no reason to speed up at all. I usually have my cruise control, but unfortunately i didn't have it on this time.

I had my window rolled down, license ready. I told him im not gonna argue with you, do what you have to do, and  this is my first EVER time getting pulled over by a cop in my whole life. He calmley smiled. He invited me to his car and said come out and have a look at my radar. And yeah the speed was there and i was disappointed. I was standing next to him, as he was sitting in the car and his door was open and we were casually chatting. He emailed me the fine, and said just slow down and go get yourself a coffee then I just shook his hands at the end and moved on.

Now I ve been having a rough time lately, tired from work, feeling lonely, not moving forward, feeling helpless, lack of friends, you name it... pretty much getting hit from life all at once.Lets just say life has been rough on me lately and I really think i don't deserve that much. Because I'm the type of guy who always try and do the right thing and im hanging in there as Im a very positive  about my daily life. Having said all that, no excuse for committing a speeding offence at all and i fully accepted it and i will take responsibility of my mistske as i understand that this a safety issue.

He said you are lucky you are in SA as it is only a speeding fine for the speed I was going, had this been in VIC, it would been a different story.

Now It is a 1k fine and some demerit points which are not mentioned on the paper and not sure how long till i will get those points back fully, as im not familiar with SA demerit points rules.

I know my options are at the bottom of the fine. But I mean is it worth it to go to court and hope for a judge that could reduce the figure? or even apply for an online review for a chance to lower the fine? 

Or should I just figure out the money, pay it, and forget about it? That way just avoiding any time wasting or anyone knowing about it. I just never been in this situation before.

I'm planning not to tell anyone at all. Not even my parents, colleagues or my manager as it could give me a concern about losing my job. I will handle this on my own and i accepted the fact that it is only my problem and no one else needs to know.

I feel disappointed of myself, like very disappointed, and still in shock about what just happened and I keep thinking it is not good enough on my end. I'm not the type of guy who gets fined (not anymore unfortunately). 

I do feel calmer after this fine it made realise that maybe i need a break in life and to slow down generally.

Thanks all for any advice about what options do I have, or whether I can I use any other confidential support options.

1h2zjqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoverPetSitting/comments/1h2zjqf/what_do_yall_think/,What do y'all think?,"At the last minute on Tue., I got booked to board a 1.5 year old pitty pup from Wed. afternoon until Mon. night, as the owner's  sitter cancelled. I asked a few questions, like pictures of the pup, whether he gets along with other animals (I have one M dog and one M cat), and if he's potty trained. Owner sent pics (he's adorable), said he does fine with dogs and doesn't bother cats, and is potty trained.

The pup is a sweetheart, but I've definitely had some issues. First, not even two hours after the owner left, he peed on the coffee table & living room rug. I was really surprised because he had just been outside with my dog and had pottied. I texted the owner about it and asked if I just needed to limit his water intake and owner said yes, so that's what I've been doing. The rug is machine washable, but he also peed on my school yearbooks, thankfully only hitting the hard cover and not the sheets. 

He is NOT good with cats. Every time he sees my cat, he rushes to attack. My poor boy has been either hiding under my bed or in the laundry room (his food and litter box are there) when he can get there since the dog is outside.

I've been having to kennel the pup because he's acting way too hyper and jealous to where I'm barely allowed to touch my dog or the pup starts guarding me and getting all up in my face. My dog takes it like a champ, but he's so sad. There are times where I'm able to have them both on top/near me and I can give them both love.

I've been home 24/7 since Wednesday, so I've been able to establish a sort of routine for the water, and I take him out to potty constantly. But then, just now while I myself was using the bathroom, I came out to find that he'd peed on my yoga mat. I've tried rinsing it off but yoga mats are basically thin sponges and I'm pretty sure it's ruined. I let him out only an hour ago, and he's only had a bit of water.

I'm not saying I can't handle all of this, but I can't stand dishonest owners and my stuff being ruined. Any advice?",2,1732924822.0,RoverPetSitting,4,0.75,False

I did it on day 19 of my cycle.

My uterus is inverted so it was an extremely painful process to get the embryo to stick with the device she used on me internally! The process hurt more than my previous caesareans and pap smears.

I was told to not do heavy lifting for the first three months of gestation if things go well, not to walk allot, avoid stress (how is that possible lol), avoid constipation and to have a cup of coffee a day if i can’t avoid caffeine. 

Told to keep taking my ivf meds for 2 months and to get a pregnancy blood test 10 days after transfer. 

I had light spotting, which ended on day 3 post transfer.

Im getting hibor injections daily for a week due to my blood blotting history near my ovary (it’s gone away but my previous FET got cancelled due to clots near my ovary).

NB: I ate a  early dinner which was a falafel sandwich and tabooleh. I ate some maccas fries later that night.  

**My questions**


Is all the above bodily symptoms the norm? Or odd?

Is it normal to still feel abdominal pain? Under my bust area and mid tummy (right side)

Is there any tips you can advise me please on how to maintain self care to increase chances of success?

Anything above that, I considered a bonus. However, as someone without experience, it felt challenging to demand such a figure, especially when competing against experienced candidates. Many companies prioritize experience over potential. On top of that, I really wanted an onsite role since I had never experienced living in Manila on my own—not even during my internship.

Throughout the process, I was firm in knowing what I wanted, not just in salary but also in how I wanted to approach my applications. I never attended an onsite interview. Why? If companies can source candidates online, isn’t it more practical and efficient to conduct the entire interview process online as well? Traveling for an interview when everything else could be done remotely didn’t make sense to me. It also showed me that a company willing to accommodate an online process values a candidate’s time and convenience, which aligned with the kind of organization I wanted to work for.

Thankfully, I found a company that met my expectations and more. I received my desired salary, completed the entire recruitment process online, and had only one interview—it was a now-or-never moment. On top of that, I got my preferred onsite schedule, working Monday to Friday + got so lucky with a flexible setup. My manager and supervisor are kind, and as a bonus, we get free coffee and meals. The company is somewhat a start-up, which I prefer since it allows me to clearly see the impact of my contributions. Additionally, we were informed during the interview that they are still improving their compensation and benefits package (only offered the gov dues before), but yesterday we got to know that we were included in the HMO plan as they continue to improve their benefits.

It feels like all the odds aligned in my favor. Staying firm about what I wanted throughout the process allowed me to land a role that meets my needs. Now, I’m praying to be regularized because I truly love the work environment, even though I’ve only been here for three weeks.

I want to acknowledge them in ways that feel meaningful:

* **For contractors**: I’d like to give a really nice personalized box from etsy, that has a pretty glass with their name on it (for water and iced coffee etc), among other things in the box like self care items. ($80). They've been with me for a long time and are amazing. 
* **For new graduates staying on**: A “Welcome to the Team” gift box to celebrate their transition, this would be a smaller self care box (like $50).
* **For current interns**: I wasn’t planning to give a gift right now, but maybe a card?

Here’s where I’m stuck: We’re having a virtual holiday party, and I’m worried the unique glasses might get noticed and someone could feel left out. I don’t want to focus on gifts during the party, but I’m not sure how to handle it if it comes up. There's even a possibility the box with the glasses would show up like right on or before the day of the party, so it might be top of mind. 

Is it okay to give different gifts like this? I’d love to hear how others have navigated similar situations and kept the holiday spirit positive for everyone. 

I always overthink gifts, and this is no exception. ",0,1732924182.0,therapists,1,0.5,False

I had 𝕞𝕒𝕟𝕪 arguments with the barista’s that Chai DOES NOT have coffee, but apparently they would get complaints from others that their Chai didn’t have coffee.

I just finished two 5 hour buses rides for thanksgiving and read about 150 pages.  If this book is really the truth (so confusing with all the pro caffeine propaganda), I feeling like throwing way all my poisonous coffee.  I feel equiped and informed (and scared about how bad caffeine may be for me), the this quit attempt now will finally work.

Has anyone heard that saying, “If its free, your the product?”  I feel like all the pro internet caffeine websites (free) were trying to sell me (the product) caffeine.  Caffeine Blues your have to purchase, so maybe the information is true.

1h2z8ig,https://www.reddit.com/r/pancreaticcancer/comments/1h2z8ig/trauma_support/,Trauma support,"Hi, been reading and looking for experiences in this sub as my dad passed at 71y last month 2 weeks after his dx. I struggle with the trauma of his hospital days and how everything went. Need to vent and ask questions either to doctors or fellows. 

Til end june he was hell of fine. We went end may for vacations. He got year ago diabetis dx, got on diet although he was just little overweight BMI 29 not obese, started daily exersise, no sugars, no alk he wasnt drinking anyways, healthy food etc. Lost weight but like intentionally to control glucose levels. Had a CT scan just a year ago and all was fine. 
Mid/end july started to complain about unspecific back pain. He thought was the new matress. Well, june already complained about severe insomnia, no pain, just night wakings after only 3hrs and unable to get back to sleep. Insomnia persisted all those months. Back pain was mild at the begining, coming and going. July blood work showed ALF and Ggt were mildly high. Month later, end of august started gastritis like symptoms but still not in pain, had nausea, no appetite, fulliness. After 10 days sent him to GP. 

September his leg gets swollen and warm. Told him looks like thrombosis, he refused to go check, he just had veins US july all was fine. Lost another 8kg without trying now in 3 months, but as he watched his diet, he was still over 90kg, a good weight for his hight. At this point I remember thinking that he is ill bc of his voice, it changed to an old man or a sick one :( 

12th sept he has US, enlarged liver with several mets biggest 4cm, enlarged gallbladder. He starts to have more of pain and gets ibuprofen600 and another mild one. I start to cook his childhood meals bc I remembered being prego and nauseious and only likeing what my mum had cooked growing up. It worked and he at least had regular small healthy meals. 

16th sept MRI shows 7cm tumor on pan tail, mets to liver, spleen, peritoneum. 

23th sept gets more pain meds, struggled sitting longer time. Gets deep leg vein thrombo dx and is put on low molecular heparin. Is already anemic and weak. 

26th he has another CT to check mets to lungs or bone, none there. But they see small lung embolism, he had not noticed.

30th has appointment to check on plattlets and coagulation and is given date for biopsy 10 days ahead. He complains to doctor about migraine like vision problems and pressure above left eye, but it went away. No one tells him how bad it is, but they tell no surgery for him. This was hard on him. He had gotten that weak I really thought we wouldnt make it to the date. In only 1 weak he wasnt able to walk 100m anymore. He is put on Fentanyl patches. From ibupeofen to fentanyl in 7 days. That night he had a 10hrs wonderful night sleep. 

1st october calls me at 8pm complaining abt severe chest pain and excessive sweating. I call ambulance and we rush to ER with a heart attack. A mild one. He is admitted to ICU for monitorization. More blood thinners, vasodilators and now morphine. Not suitable for stent bc incompatible procedure with biopsy from liver. They want to wait 48h. Our hospital allows overnight in ICU box and he didnt sent me home to my little kids. I think he was so hell of afraid, he was a bear of a man never afraid of anything. But now thinking of him not sending me home, he only told me he is sorry he put me through this. He needed me there, he was afraid being there alone. It breaks my heart. I not even thought of leaving.

2nd oct he is hemodinamically stable. Drs take me out to tell me if someone told us how shitty his condition is and what a bad prognosis it has. No one tells him! At night he has some confusions, taking away cables wanting to go to bathroom not remembering where he was. I explain, he remembers, we go back to sleep.
3rd oct breakfast is brought he dosent remember he doesnt like coffee with milk, never drank that. I go get him a tea and when I come back he is like dizzy and confused. He has a stroke. CT scan, back right artery ischemic stroke, left side paralyzed, all concious. Not candidate for disolver due to all of the heparin. Aweful afternoon and night. He asks desperatly all the time for cooling his head and neck, not sleeping, not resting, but no pain. He can speak a little bit, has lot of strenghs in right body side. He tries leave the bed. Later I learned they are not aware of the body side is not responding.

4th doctors asking me what to do if he gets another stroke, hemorrage and needs intubation and tell me they wouldnt do any bc he has such bad prognosis of the cancer and is not in shape for chemo. No one asks him although he is concious and can answer and state his will. I go by them recommendations :( I am not brave enough to tell him or ask him :(
He gets agressive towards nurses and tries pull off electrodes and needles.
He gets feeding tube and catether and is discharged from ICU to other unit for recovery. Gets 3 to 6 months without treatment. Another restless night where he just wouldnt stop moving right limbs up and down, up and down. They remove catether, he was just to unconfy urinating that way. He had bladder control and prefered the bottle. He tries to remove feeding tube. He is not allowed water, his mouth gets dry. He asks for water, I am not allowed (**cry). He has some hallucinations but knows who I am. 

5th oct I leave hospital at lunch time to go home have a shower. He still is very restless with his right limbs. Come back 3hrs later, he is completly wet from sweating, his face, his bed and not moving leg and arm. Still can squeeze my hand, answers is conious. Call nurse, vitals stable, light fever, they give meds. They change his robe and beddings another 3 times, he sweats that much. He has no pain. He tells me he is cold or warm. He struggles breathing and starts coughing badly. With every 

4th breath he opens ups his eyes widley and has my hand thight for some hours like this. He says he cant see anything. I Ask for MD at night. They tell me sth must have happened, another stroke/bleeding and he is worsening. Plus a possible infection, plus aspiration. He is given meds to be able to rest and go for a CT early morning. He rests and I go home for some sleep. 

6th oct his lungs are filling with fluids, he is not able to move anything nor feel even my hand holding his. They dont do another CT, for them it is clear. They want to put him on morphine pump and sedate. I agree. 

7th oct you could see he wasnt there anymore, only a his body. Went home for 2hrs and he passed. 

I am traumatized by the desicions i had to make over his life. At that time I was sure I was making the right thing, he never ever would have wanted to be stroke survivor in bad conditions and not selfsufficiant. He had a friend to who it happend, we had that talk. And I just wanted for him to not suffer, to not be aware of what was happening. I was thinking how he gonna make a recovery from the stroke while the cancer was progressing that quickly. He d go from one shit into another more painful one. Doctors seemed to say almost he is lucky getting stroke or heart attack and not living the painful days of pancan. I was convinced I did good. Even doctor friend went through labs and all and stood by my side saying it is a brave choice and the right one. I even thought at that time he should refuse chemo and enjoy what is left instead of being compromised by the side effects.

But week after his funeral all starts getting messy in my had. I read abt palliative chemo and success stories even at stage IV. I read abt stroke recovery. And I have moments I think I failed him. He relaid on me to advocate for him, to push, to fight and I gave him up just like that. I just didnt want him to suffer, and wasnt brave enough to go through the harder stuff to eventually get him some chemo, fenben or whatever. What if I failed him. What if he trusted me to save him, to give him a chance. He just not got any at all and I didnt fight hard enough, I didnt fight at all. And I was never brave enough to tell him he s gonna die, never could verbalize a goodbye, only said over again ""you ll go home""...",3,1732923894.0,pancreaticcancer,4,1.0,False

My sister told me she tried to text me earlier this year and so I decided to reach back out and apologize for being so on and off with her over the years. 

She reacted to it with 🥰 and responded saying “It's okay, (my name) ❤️ I was shitty to you at times in the past! And truly I was okay with you being off and on, because I understood it. It didn't make me angry, it just always made me think of you even more and really with all the more happiness for you. You can message me any time you want. I'm not always on Facebook of course, but if I see it's from you I'll answer. I genuinely hope that you're doing well, and that things are going good. We're at that time in our lives personally where I personally rewatch my dumbass self stumble through my 20s just wishinggg l could go back and not do all the shit I ever did. Of course, I cannot. But I am thankful to still know people from my past throughout all this time and change, and I am thankful for you.”

She was answering my messages after that quickly, within 10 min and sounded enthusiastic to talk to me, and suggested we go hiking with coffee saying “if you’re up for it let’s do it!” 

I replied the next day saying “Sounds fun, I could be down for that sometime 😊” keeping it cool, and she’s been radio silent since then, it’s been almost a week. And she’s been uploading songs onto her Work playlist that all have themes of a super toxic relationship that is a lot worse than ours was- all with lyrics that reflect feeling extremely hurt, betrayed, and angry and bitter which don’t reflect the tone of her message to me at all. 

But she’s also posted a bunch of songs that DO match our relationship dynamic to a T.

Idk what her relationship status is. I just know she’s a lyrics person like me. 

So I’m concluding she must be involved with someone else now from that. Am I overthinking it? She always told me how genuinely happy she was with me and asked me out several times over the years, which I rejected because I wasn’t ready at the time after our falling out/break up. I needed more time. Well I feel ready now and I wonder if she is preoccupied with someone else now or if I’m just reading too much into her playlist all together.

I've just moved into a house with a garden all around it and was very excited to garden and grow food BUT

Bees are always around me, my husband says they're just flying around but I'm literally having bees fly at me and around me after being outside for a few minutes. I can't go outside and stretch, I can't sit outside the door step with a coffee nor can I garden.  I don't wear perfume, I wear deodorant that has little to no smell at all, I wear all black all the time, I stand away from gardens when I'm outside and I still have bee's flying at me and around me.

I genuinely don't know what to do, I don't want to get rid of my garden. Is it something I'm doing that makes them interested? are there smells that bees don't like so I can keep them away from me? I like the bees pollinating the flowers and they do great stuff but why are they so interested. Do they need something? I don't want to harm them or ""get rid"" of them, our gardens are a large source of pollen for them but they also think I'm a source of pollen or I'm an enemy.

I am so unsure what to do and I'd like to go outside.

1h2z4x2,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1h2z4x2/a_holiday_rant/,A holiday rant,"A long post, just trying to let out my emotions into the void. Until I can have a sit down with my boyfriend. 

For the holidays my bf invited his fellow soldiers to the apartment since they didn’t have any holiday plans. Didn’t have enough to go visit, or don’t have family to do holidays with. I thought this was great idea. We cleaned, cooked, and hosted. It was great except when the guys started talking about women. In a degraded, womanizing, Andrew Tate type of way. I felt uncomfortable so I left to the room. Plus they are all men that try to be fuck boys or dead beat baby daddies. 

I wasent able to enjoy the holiday at all, I was up in the bedroom reading and only ate a little because I was disgusted by their graphic conversations. I’ve always spent it with family, partner or my partners family. 

This morning my bf left to help a Sgt. Move stuff because he’s leaving the army soon. Then he promised me we’d get coffee together after and hang out.

 He gets home with my coffee and says  he’s going to get ready to go play basketball with his LT and a few guys from last night. He never told me but showed me the messages that he made the plans yesterday. But clearly he forgot himself because he said he will hang out with me after the moving stuff. 

He left and before coming back texted me “I’m going to watch Moana 2 with *luis, do you want to come?” *luis was one of the main men that talked about women having high standards. Reasons were childish tbh. I haven’t had a chance to talk to my bf in person ab me being uncomfortable because since the moment he woke up, he’s been on the move outside the home. While I cleaned up after his party. I tell him I’m good and to go have fun with his friend. He comes home from basketball gives me a kiss and tries to be extra silly to “makeup” he says he will make it up to me tmrrw. 

Ehhhhhh I don’t have an issue with him being social and hanging out with his friends but tell me straight up. Especially when he says after one thing we will hang out and keeps postponing it with pop up plans. Then at the end of the day I’m not starting any projects or getting too involved with anything so when he gets home I don’t have to worry on dropping something, before I’m ready to. So I literally waste my day waiting. 

We had a discussion literally yesterday because he didn’t tell me his friend was coming over before party time to cook his own thing, when I needed that time to make the ham. I got mopey before the friend came over and my bf got mad and told me it’s always something. I reminded him I planned out the day to have everything done and now I have to re plan and share the tiny tiny kitchen we have that is barely big enough to cook everything we are trying to. He apologized and said he understood. 

So for him to do the shifting plans thing again feels not intentional but completely dismissive of what we talked about yesterday. At the end of the day I told him to go on his own because I’m just annoyed I guess that I wouldn’t even want to join them. 

I feel so alone, no friends in this state, no friend back home due to how busy I was to the point I wasn’t taking care of myself. It’s just a lot because of the holiday season I’ve always had someone, I’ve NEVER sat in a room alone through the holidays.

When he gets home I’ll talk to him. ",3,1732923597.0,offmychest,2,1.0,False

1h2z1ez,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1h2z1ez/any_other_partners_not_getting_fair_chances_to_be/,Any other partners not getting fair chances to be on bar?,"I've been a partner for six months now, and I've been on bar a total of less than 10 times. For the first four months, they didn't put me on bar at all. They trained me on register and kept me there. I think they were planning to fire me so didn't want to bother training me on bar (I have an anxiety disorder that made me struggle quite a bit at the beginning, although I found workarounds that allowed me to improve). They brought in multiple new partners after me that they trained on bar right away, which honestly just made it feel like a hostile work environment to me. 

After about four months, the DM finally forced them to train me on bar, so they did. They even said I was doing well, for the most part. Even though my SSV said my third day on bar that I'm too slow and this is why I don't get a lot of bar time - this was because I took three minutes to make a drink that I had never made before and had to look it up on the iPad. This made me mad because it's not that I'm not on bar because I'm too slow, it's that I'm slow BECAUSE these people haven't given me a chance to be on bar and learn the drinks.

And now, they're back to putting me on register all the time. They claim that I'm too slow to be on bar, but like I said I've been on bar less than 10 times - how the fk am I supposed to get fast when they're not even giving me a chance to try and improve???

And honestly, I don't think I'm that slow. I see the SSV yelling at everyone on bar, not just me. And there's a girl who always gets to be on bar, who started after I did, who makes half the drinks incorrectly. She made the last two drinks I marked out wrong (gave me a coffee frappe when I wanted a creme one, and put lemonade in my refresher when I'd ordered one with coconut milk). And one time, the SSV had her make a bunch of drinks as a test and she made EVERY SINGLE ONE wrong. It genuinely makes me mad because I'm wondering why she deserves all that bar time and I don't.

I may be a little slower because I want to be precise and sure (probably because of my anxiety disorder), but at least I make all the drinks correctly. Why does the girl who can't even make the drinks right get to be on bar all the time and i don't????

It just feels really unfair. They're not letting me on bar because I'm not fast enough, but they've barely even given me a chance to practice and get fast. And they don't let me make drinks even when business is slower and I try to - the SSV always says ""I got it, just go back to the register."" It feels like they're trying to withhold bar time from me for no reason, and it honestly kind of feels like a hostile work environment because LITERALLY EVERYONE ELSE THERE gets ample bar time. They'll let the newbies on bar before they let me do it.

Wife and I have slightly different preferences for this purchase. I want something that just makes good quality drip coffee and that’s it (hence why I’m here). She wants it to be programmable and able to do single cup up to full pot.

I’ve solved the programmable concern with a smart plug (I know that these machines brew super fast so don’t really need to be programmed ahead of time, but I can’t win them all).

For single cup to full pot flexibility, curious if KBGV or KB (auto vs manual) are better for this possibility. I know technically they are supposed to just do half or full pots. But I’ve read that you can fill it with the water/beans you need and it should hopefully work for smaller sizes.

1) Will this work?

2) Are there any cons to making smaller sizes than half pot with this method?

3) If it works, is one model better than the other for this?

Thanks! Hoping I can fully sell my wife on this machine!",1,1732923221.0,Moccamaster,5,1.0,False

We would hang out in class at first, then we moved to doing exam practice together alone most the time and we sailed through two years of the course. 

My wife and I went to her house , met her family and broke bread. Her mum didn’t seem to give me much eye contact but my wife schmoozed the room and everyone seemed to get on okay. End of the evening we offer to drop LO’s best mate from high school home but she refused and stayed. My wife felt later that the girls wanted to talk about us but I think she was dramatic. 

To celebrate exams I took LO to fancy restaurant and we planned this year to do optional modules together. My wife got concerned that one module is abroad and I shouldn’t be encouraged to go with her so I’m staying at home. 

My wife offered to tutor us both for exams last year but we only managed one afternoon session as LO felt she was being slowed down as my wife who’s qualified (but particular in her manner) was being very pedantic about communication skills over content. We still managed to both pass.

During summer I messaged her about her trip and mine and my wife read the messages- I deleted her old ones as it’s a lot of heart messages and us arranging private study sessions. My wife was like don’t flirt with her as I called myself tasty in reference to a cow charging at me n my wife. So I started a plan to slow try phase her out so less direct messages and no memes 

Now we are in similar classes this year and we were doing okay. I visited her new residence, had a tea, went out for brunch once and dropped her homehome once - 2hr car journey. We swapped modules and I thought I should give her space and myself to try ease my own limerance… as sometimes when I hang with LO it’s just so so fun I wish I could do it more. 3weeks go past NC and then I see her last week at classes. 

She giving me heavy ex gf energy, first day she seems flustered and rushes of in front when normally she would walk by my side and we would get coffee or something. she doesn’t say hi, doesn’t want to partner up (extremely unlike her) and when I speak to her she looks like a deer in headlights and very stressed. Given her attitude I leave early and she’s drops me a messages saying let’s do exam practice with a friend next day- I agree. Next day we have a trio revision session and she happy and herself with the other girl but blunt and avoiding eye contact with me but we bumble through - she then runs off again.  I drop her a message to check she’s okay and she claims she just busy. We have a little bit of exam only discussion on WhatsApp now. But she seemed so different this last week - wtf has changed? Am I naive in believing she has feelings? Or has the NC time allowed her to realise we need some boundaries?

Throughout all of this since the second meeting I have been infatuated with this girl. She sparkled in like psychedelic lighting that day and I knew I either will be obsessed with her or I should never speak to her in respect to my wife.

I have been so so wrong - I check my phone constantly and message back instantly- most times I get a reply back in a day or two but I am obsessed with any reciprocation and love when she’s online and we have longer talks. Last month though was 3 weeks NC and now this hot/cold business I’m so confused for last two years she’s been so platonic and enthusiastic but now she’s distant and claiming to be busy. 

Why am I so obsessed- I know there is no possibility of any relationship and she’s Muslim so very conservative but we talk a lot about her concerns of never kissing a boy and what sex entails but this is on her end- I just giggle along and tell her all will be fine. She’s never shown interest in me and I thought we had developed a bond and I just had a crush but this is constant intrusive thoughts over the last three years. I don’t think a day goes without me thinking about her. I get upset when she doesn’t reply and I made any excuse to go uni to see her 

What can I do? I love my wife but I’m constantly thinking oh what if I did this with LO. I feel so much guilt and feel angry simultaneously that LO is so self centered but she should be - she owes me nothing I can’t give her true love I can just pedestal her and admire from afar 

No sexual stuff has happened between us but earlier on I thought she was just Uber friendly with me and now my memories are twisted thinking we had some flirting going on - once the teacher had to tell us off as LO kept interrupting the discussion to bother me. 

wtf guys! wtf am I doing!?! why do I keep bother her on WhatsApp!?! Why is my brain like this!?! Why can’t I crave my wife like this!?! I never knew I could be so easily swayed by someone so young and recent in my life. I just miss LO so much all the time and I hate this weird state we are in

We had mini horses growing up--probably 6 over the span of a few years (some even gave birth on our farm). We also had cows, chickens, etc. It was my dad's hobby and he was also a businessman during the day downtown--he was the only one to really take care of them. I was 0-10 y/o when we had them but have very fond memories. My cousin up the street took care of them when we were out of town (and could if I was out of town with this horse). We live in Cleveland, OH. In a suburbish area but have a lot of land. No other families nearby have farm animals (but we have more property than most because my parents moved here decades ago and were the first on the street). I am thinking about getting an older horse (maybe rescue an older one 15-20 years old). However, I want to ride it for fun around the property. I am about 100 pounds and 28 y/o (just over five feet). I would have it at my parent's property, living in the barn for free. We still have the barn with four stalls and a large fenced area. The property is 40 acres but the area the horse would be able to go on (because much is woods) is about 10-15 acres. I just bought a house (before having this idea) which is 10 mins away so I could come over in the morning and evening. I am single (living alone) and am getting a yellow lab dog soon--and would get the horse within a year ideally. I am fantastic with dogs, my family had 15 over the span of my life. I love animals, nurture them, and feel so connected to life with them. The reason for this is because I want the unique life-long-dream experience, I want to ride the horse, I want to utilize our barn and property, I want to brush and care for the horse, give it enrichment, connect with it. I have spent much of my 20s traveling and a lot of it solo but because I love experiencing life and have had many opportunities that I am sooo grateful for. I am not a drinker. I don't drink coffee. Bit of a health nut. Don't go out all night and travel much anymore. I'm feeling more settled and find peace in this idea and routine and purpose. I work from home remotely so my schedule is very flexible. I could even do work in my parents house and take a lunch break and check on the horse. I am very close with my parents. I would pay the food and vet bills--Please share about how much it would cost for everything annually... I am guessing 2-4k? I understand it is a ton of work, but I have had this dream far in the back of my head for years. Today it just came to me because now that I am living so close, it could ACTUALLY happen! My mom is totally on board because she knows im responsible and we are keeping our house for a while. I just told my dad tonight for the first time and he's joking about not responding--silence-- but if I really wanted to and had a plan and honestly have a realistic approach he would 100% support me in this. I was never the type to get a dog and then my parents take care of it. Even in middle school I was the main caretaker for our pets. Is this crazy or should i do this?

1h2yvxq,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepyencounters/comments/1h2yvxq/creepy_camper_at_canadian_campsite/,Creepy Camper at Canadian Campsite,"Fair warning, this is slightly long and a slow burn, but 5 years on I still get creeped out thinking about this encounter and whether it could have ended very differently. Sorry there's no TL;DR.

This occurred a few years ago in 2019 whilst my partner and I were taking a road trip across BC,  Canada. We'd rented a car from Vancouver and were just making our way towards Banff, up to Jasper then back towards Vancouver via Whistler, a little anti-clockwise loop. All in we traveled for around 5 weeks total, sleeping in National park campsites or rest stops along the way.

One evening somewhere along the Crowsnest Highway between Paulson and Castlegar we arrived at a Provincial Park campground where we intended to stay the night. A nice easy spot next to a lake with a large parking area, many benches and a wooden shelter, but far from any civilisation. There were already a few other people there with motorhomes and caravans, we were the only ones with a tent.

We arrived before dark, setup the tent, sharing a few polite greetings with the other campers. There was one guy in particular, old chap I would guess to have been late 60s with a motor home who was very friendly and chatty, but a little too chatty.

He noticed we had our coffee pot (mocka) with us and mentioned that he had a 5kg bag of coffee beans in his motorhome if we wanted some, though he followed up by saying he didn't even drink coffee because he didn't like the taste. He persisted in offering for us to come to his motorhome to get some beans. This sounded a little odd. We politely declined.

He eventually left us, we got our tent pitched and went to prepare dinner in the onsite shelter. My partner and I shared a few glances to each other, clearly neither of us felt particularly comfortable around this guy, but perhaps he was harmless. We kept our eyes open while we were cooking and noticed he wandered off towards the lake, presumably for a walk.

While we were eating we spotted him returning, trying to avoid being seen we just avoided eye contact and got stuck into our dinner. Unfortunately he spotted us and wandered over. Despite us being partway through eating he begun chatting with us. Being the type of people who never want to be rude or offend we politely returned conversation, nodded and ate.

I don't remember the whole conversation but a couple of things stood out to us. He asked questions about our relationship, were we married, did we live together, did we have children, did we want to have children. Some questions bordering on being a little too personal. It could have been considered innocent coming from a relative or a friend, but coming from this stranger we just felt some uncomfortable undertones to his questioning.

He noticed we were drinking water with our meal and asked if we drank coca-cola. He mentioned that he had a multi-pack of coca-cola cans in his motorhome if we wanted some, though said he didn't drink the stuff himself. He again persisted in inviting us to his motorhome to take a couple of cans each. We politely declined.

At this point my partner and I were sharing glances, we noticed that we were both feeling totally uneasy around this guy and quickly finished up dinner, made our excuses to get up and leave, realising he wasn't going to leave us alone so easier for us to leave him there in the shelter.

We cleaned up our cooking stuff, packed everything into our car and prepared the tent for the night. Whilst doing so he approached us again on his way back to his motorhome, again inviting us to come and get some coca-cola or join him watching TV if we wished to. Again we politely declined.

At this point the light was fading so we took ourselves down to the lake for a quick walk, brushing our teeth as we walked, rubbish bag in hand to dispose of in the bins at the bottom of the car park. As we approached the bins we noticed a large shadowy figure leaning into one of the bins. Startled by our presence it jumped down from the bin onto all fours and ran for the treeline. Both my partner and I froze. There was no mistaking it. The large cat-like silhouette with the long slender tail. We'd just interrupted a mountain lion foraging through the bins! Thankfully it was more afraid of us and made a run for the trees before we had even realised what we had seen.

Startled, we both turned back and fastwalked back up the hill, agreeing that we would instead sleep in the car that evening, not knowing whether that mountain lion would have been lurking nearby just beyond the treeline or not, but we decided not to chance it.

We reclined the seats, locked the doors and slept until morning, thinking of the close encounter with the mountain lion and having put the creepy old camper to the back of our minds.

In the morning we woke early before anyone else, packed the tent and got the hell out of there, heading for whatever town was next on the map, relieved to have left that entire scenario behind. We didn't bump into either the creepy old guy or the mountain lion again.

Continuing on our journey we wondered if perhaps we had misread the whole situation with the creepy old guy, but I like to think that our intuition is pretty good and both of us sensed there was something off. Later that day I received a call from my brother back home checking up on us and making sure we were okay. He'd seen on the news that there was a manhunt underway in BC after a spate of killings that week and naturally he was concerned for us! It turns out there were two guys on the run after murdering three people further north towards Alaska! The suspects didn't resemble the old guy we met in any way, but it did make us wonder what his intentions were.

Thinking back to that experience we wonder if we overeacted, whether this creepy camper was just some harmless Grandpa looking for company and conversation, or perhaps we were fortunate and avoided a much different fate. Trust your gut if something doesn't feel right. 

Thanks if you made it this far. Curious to hear anyone's thoughts on this situation and whether we should have handled it differently.",11,1732922873.0,creepyencounters,3,0.92,False

My sister told me she tried to text me earlier this year and so I decided to reach back out and apologize for being so on and off with her over the years. 

She reacted to it with 🥰 and responded saying “It's okay, (my name) ❤️ I was shitty to you at times in the past! And truly I was okay with you being off and on, because I understood it. It didn't make me angry, it just always made me think of you even more and really with all the more happiness for you. You can message me any time you want. I'm not always on Facebook of course, but if I see it's from you I'll answer. I genuinely hope that you're doing well, and that things are going good. We're at that time in our lives personally where I personally rewatch my dumbass self stumble through my 20s just wishinggg l could go back and not do all the shit I ever did. Of course, I cannot. But I am thankful to still know people from my past throughout all this time and change, and I am thankful for you.”

She was answering my messages after that quickly, within 10 min and sounded enthusiastic to talk to me, and suggested we go hiking with coffee saying “if you’re up for it let’s do it!” 

I replied the next day saying “Sounds fun, I could be down for that sometime 😊” keeping it cool, and she’s been radio silent since then, it’s been almost a week. And she’s been uploading songs onto her Work playlist that all have themes of a super toxic relationship that is a lot worse than ours was- all with lyrics that reflect feeling extremely hurt, betrayed, and angry and bitter which don’t reflect the tone of her message to me at all. 

But she’s also posted a bunch of songs that DO match our relationship dynamic to a T.

Idk what her relationship status is. I just know she’s a lyrics person like me. 

So I’m concluding she must be involved with someone else now from that. Am I overthinking it? She always told me how genuinely happy she was with me and was devastated when we broke up, asked me out several times over the years, which I rejected because I wasn’t ready at the time after our falling out/break up. I needed more time. Well I feel ready now and I wonder if she is preoccupied with someone else now or if I’m just reading too much into her playlist all together.

To start, I work for a decently sized multidiscipline engineering company in the uk, I’m actually a student on a placement year so I get a salary and I’m treated like a regular employee, just with more help needed sometimes. For the most part I get on with the work I’m given, make tea and coffee runs for my coworkers, and get shown off to clients when they come to see our progress. 

I’ve only been here a few months so I’m still getting used to it. The day this all began, I was told I could sit-in on a meeting with a higher up from an influential organisation. They wanted me to help show him around after the meeting too; I was nervous but keen to make a good impression, you know?

Towards the end of the tour, the coworker that had been helping me buggered off for an important phone call, promising to be back soon and leaving me alone with the guy.

We were in an area of the building I didn’t know very well; we walked in awkward silence until someone who seemed to recognise us both (I’m not great with faces so I assumed he was a coworker) showed us to a nearby breakroom and asked if the higher-up wanted a cup of tea, asking me to make it.

The higher-up said something about sugar, and not having his usual stevia sachets on him. The other guy said we actually had some in a different room and he’d get one if I boiled the kettle. I was pretty drained by then but kept up the polite conversation as I made the cups, and thanked the other guy as he appeared again to throw me a single sachet.

Stevia is like a sugar substitute my mum used to be crazy for, though I always thought it tasted awful.

It was odd, I didn’t even know we had some in the offices, it's not exactly common. Even stranger, I noticed a slight misalignment of the sachets’ ends, probably a manufacturing error, so I thought nothing of it and served the tea for us both.

Minutes later, he was seizing.

Gasping for air, clawing at his throat, eyes bulging. I was terrified, frozen for a moment.

I ran to the door and shouted for help, tearing through the hall until I found someone. The rest happened quickly. 

Shouting. 

CPR. 

Sirens. 

He was covered when they took him into the ambulance. I don’t think he was breathing.

I spent a while sitting in reception with a blanket over me, different voices asking if I was alright, saying it was probably a stroke, not to worry, he was an older gentleman, etc.

I’ve seen a stroke before, that was scary enough on its own, but something about what happened felt wrong. He didn’t slur his words, and it happened so suddenly. Well, I thought, surely the doctors would know if it was something else, I had enough to worry about.

I headed back to my computer to get my stuff and leave for the day, ready to call my parents and have a good cry about it all, but on the way out I was pulled aside by the same unfamiliar guy from earlier. He sounded serious so I followed him to a room on his instruction.

It was dark, he gestured to sit down, the door closed. A light flickered on directly into my eyes.

Exclaiming my discomfort, I politely asked what was going on, and told him I needed to leave or I’d get a parking ticket. I heard shuffling and became aware that there were others, I couldn't make out their faces, or how many. They asked what the last thing the higher-up ate or drank was. I answered tea, the cup I’d made for him, actually. 

I was starting to get nervous, I’d already had a shit day, some coworkers playing detective was the last thing I needed. Maybe they were with the police? Or just joking? I had no idea what was about to happen. I should have forced my way out but then again, I was outnumbered.

They asked some innocuous questions about the meeting and me showing the guy around, I recounted everything. After a while they paused, and put a tablet on the table in front of me.

It was security footage of me giving him the tea, just as I’d described, but how did they have access to it so soon after the incident? Then they voiced my worst fears.

“His drink was contaminated by cyanide, and the only one who handled that drink was you.” 

I sat in silence for a moment, then came to my senses. I asked how they’d even know that, I said this wasn’t a funny joke, but I had a sinking feeling when they didn’t answer.

They placed some large photographs on the table. They were of me, in what looked like a lab. I’d never been there, I said so, and that these photos must be fake. Still silence.

As my mind was racing, it hit me. We had drunk the same cup of tea, same water, teabags, milk, the only difference in our cups was that I had a packet of sugar and he, oh god, he’d had the stevia sachet I was given.

Given to me by the person who brought me in here. Actually what the fuck was going on, I barely held myself together. Then someone with gloved hands produced a small glass bottle and placed it on the table, it had warning symbols on it and a white powder inside.

“It has your fingerprints”

“It can’t. I’ve never touched that, I don’t recognise it. Or those photos, look I don’t understand what's happening. This is all fake, it has to be.”

“Well, even if it is, imagine if this evidence was sent to the police. It would be quite the drawn out process to dispute. You might even go to prison, and that would be a shame.”

So they weren’t with the police, that much was clear. Cyanide? The symptoms lined up. It really didn’t seem like they were joking. Fuck, the seriousness of it started to dawn on me, they were framing me for murder. Panic set in, I’m sure they saw it in my face. I sat speechless and almost hyperventilating until someone spoke.

“It’s alright.”

The shift in tone unbalanced me. Suddenly it was soft, dulcet.

“We’ll agree to never speak of this if you don’t, how about that? No need to look so worried.”

I didn’t reply, I had no idea how to. I heard the door open and saw the light from the hallway. I stood up hesitantly and looked around. Couldn’t make out faces still, but as I moved to leave, the guy who brought me here followed behind. He said nothing, but put his finger to his lips in a ‘shh’ motion, and closed the door.

In retrospect, I should have driven straight to the police station, but instead I just drove home. I’m not a decisive person at the best of times. I just laid in bed and ran everything back over and over. The following few days played out like normal, maybe it was stupid of me but I tried to forget about it.

I sort of convinced myself it must have been a stress based delusion, misinterpretation of events, anything else that made sense. I felt like I was falling in the dark, with no idea when I’d hit the ground. Perhaps if I just ignored what happened it would all go away. 

That Friday, it must have been just past 5pm, I was saving my work and looking through my emails when one of my coworkers tapped me on the shoulder.

“Hey, I think someone from your university is here to check on you” and pointed me to a hallway that leads to some other offices and staircases.

I asked if she was sure and she said yes. I was immediately suspicious, people from my uni do have to check on me sometimes, but that happens online. The office was clearing out by then and that coworker disappeared too. I went to the door of the hallway and poked my head through.

There were people from the other offices going down the stairs on the far side, I took a few steps in and craned my head when the door next to me flew open, startling me, so much so that I didn’t quite realise I was looking at the same guy from before.

“Do you want to come inside quickly?” he said, holding the door open to the small meeting room.

He spoke casually, cheerfully even. He was smiling, and close enough to me that I felt a jolt of terror upon recognition. “Come on, it won’t take a minute.” 

I couldn’t help but feel like if I’d shouted at the other people, and somehow I was wrong about everything, I’d be so mortally embarrassed. I know that sounds dumb but I get so paranoid sometimes and it felt like I was losing it. He took my shoulder and guided me inside, I just let him.

I stood by a chair but refused to sit, mustering the courage to ask to leave, to hurl an insult, or interrogate him about what happened on the day I saw that man die. He leaned against the door, seeming calm. 

“You’ve heard about the trip to the conference on Monday, I imagine?”

Not what I expected, I had heard of it but I wasn’t going as far as I knew. I said nothing.

“Okay, well you’ve been added to the trip at the last minute, you’ll be emailed the details soon. There’s a… person of interest who will be attending. We’d like you to talk to her.”

“Who’s we?” 

I must have snapped back, because I remember him looking a bit surprised. I had a makeshift plan to stay quiet until he let me go, but I failed at the first hurdle.

“Uh, the managers and people organising the trip? We want to make sure you get the most out of your time here, networking is important.”

He said it like I was stupid for asking, and momentarily what he said made sense. However as he went to sit down and gesture for me to also, I saw a shadow across the frosted glass pane in the door. Someone else was blocking us in. 

He went on to give me details of the trip, and gave me a profile of the lady I was supposed to talk to. She was an established member of the industry, and in her presentation would be covering the topic of increasing the outreach of engineering for young people, especially girls.

He suggested I talk to her about this at some point, perhaps the evening events that most people would be attending. He told me to find a way to convince her to let me into her hotel room. It sounded mostly reasonable, except for that last point.

He handed me a sealed white bag with something clearly inside it while he talked. I barely even noticed taking it. When I did, I frowned at it and went to look inside. 

“Oh don’t open that. You’ll know what to do with it when the time comes.”

“Alright, fine, I won’t open this. And I’ll go on the trip. Can I leave now?”

I decided compliance, at least until I could leave the building, was probably the safest option.

To my relief he said yes, and opened the door. He said he’d show me to a side exit of the building, closer to my parking spot than the main entrance.

I protested weakly but he strong-armed me into it, I can’t quite remember how. I ended up walking through some now deserted offices belonging to other departments, and down some stairs I’d never seen before. I didn’t turn around but the whole time I could hear a third set of footsteps behind us.

Before I knew it, we were in a narrow hallway I didn’t recognise. He pointed to the door at the end, and I really hoped it was the way out. It was a heavy door, and I stumbled through it as it gave way.

I found myself in a room empty save a single mattress on the ground, the door slammed behind me.

I tried the handle but it was locked. I pounded on the door, screaming at him to let me out. I banged my fists until they throbbed with pain, and shouted myself hoarse over and over and over. No one responded. I slid to the floor in defeat, tears in my eyes. I just wanted to go home, for this to stop.

I considered quitting the placement when I got out (*if* i got out), maybe quitting uni if I had to, going back to live with my parents, anything if it meant I never had to see that wretched man again or be a part of whatever scheme was going on here.

I must have been shouting for hours, so eventually I gave in and laid on the mattress, it was not comfortable. The sickening yellow light above me dimmed. I looked to see a camera in one of the corners. Ugh, of course I was being watched.

As I was drifting off, I could have sworn I heard a low drone playing through unseen speakers. It was irritating at first but I got used to it, maybe it even lulled me to sleep.

The next bit is a blur, I wish I could tell you what happened but I just can’t remember it. I know I woke up to the door opening, and I’m positive some kind of plastic mask was forced over my face. Everything else is gone. I get some flashes of images, bits of voices here and there, but it's like trying to remember a dream.

I don’t know what they did to me.

After that, I remember gaining awareness as I was sat in my car, in the parking lot of my block of flats. I checked my phone to see it was Sunday afternoon. 

The first thing I did in my flat was make some food, the next thing was to open the barrage of messages asking what happened.

I usually call my parents on Saturdays, and talk to my friends on discord pretty frequently. I think I typed out a few messages explaining what had happened but couldn’t force myself to send them, no matter how much I wanted to. I settled on saying I was fine, and for those who asked, told them I’d slept through most of Saturday and had been catching up on chores.

Speaking of those chores, I had a lot that I needed to do for the rest of the day, it helped me take my mind off things. I didn’t even know where to begin. I made some attempts to figure it all out, rationalise it all again, but I couldn’t just wave away the missing time.

There wasn’t much I could think of doing that would fix things, and I was so exhausted I just collapsed on my bed in the evening. The last thing I looked at was my inbox - there was a new email with details about the conference trip.

Next thing I knew I was on the company-hired coach at 7am sharp. I fell asleep there too, someone had to wake me up when we arrived at the hotel.

Most of the day was a bit boring, I couldn’t focus on the talks we went to, I had too much on my mind. It was agonising. Then we got to the presentation I’d unknowingly been waiting for.

I knew the woman talking immediately, though I don’t recall being shown her face. I’ll call her Sandra (fake name). Under ordinary circumstances, I would have genuinely been interested in Sandra’s points, but the nerves ate away at me and I didn’t even know what I was nervous about. She seemed so nice, and was an engaging speaker.

The evening event we went to was kinda like an after party, I didn’t want to go but my colleagues encouraged me and I knew I didn’t really have a choice. I caught sight of Sandra there and beelined for her before I could stop myself, I found words that didn’t feel like mine spilling out of my mouth.

Mostly gushing about her presentation, saying how inspired I was, this would have been fine except I mentioned so many things about work she’d done in the past. I’d never even heard of her until three days ago, how did I know all this?

Conversation with her was easy, she took me under her wing. Being almost motherly, encouraging me as a female engineer, asking about how I was getting on in my degree.

I’m small and innocent looking for my age so I’m used to older adults fawning over me or infantilising me. I often find it super fucking weird but she gave me such an impression of kindness and genuinity.

She left to talk to others throughout the evening but kept coming back to check up on me. Each time I felt myself warming to her, my chest tightened and my breath caught in my throat as I remembered that I was carrying out some kind of mission. I knew something awful had to happen to her. 

At one point I mentioned something from her presentation that I apparently didn’t understand and asked her to explain.

Since the event was ending, she offered to show me how it worked if I’d like to come to her hotel room as we were staying in the same place. I wanted to say no, even to tell her not to let me in, but I accepted anyway.

I went back to my room. I wanted to rest, but I found myself rummaging through my suitcase all the same, opening that white bag. I stood by my door, now with a small pill box in my pocket, it read ‘Ramipril’.

I listened for movement and voices and checked the peephole before moving out, identifying the security cameras and turning my face away from them, without even thinking. It felt the same as walking on a familiar route to the shops, absent minded almost, despite the unease growing deep in my gut.

Sandra was so happy to see me, so eager as she got out her laptop and talked me through my questions. I stopped her to ask if I could use her toilet quickly. She had the same box of pills in there as the one in my pocket. Was mine a wiretap? Did it have a tracker? Or something more sinister?

It felt like I was a zombie, like all control had slipped from my grasp as I swapped the boxes, and carried on after like I’d done nothing. I wanted to warn her about the pills, beg her for help, I was so scared inside and she couldn’t see. I couldn’t tell her. I was a bystander in my own body.

It gets fuzzy after that point, I could only watch in horror as my body moved on its own, feeling nauseous with fear and barely able to think. I needed to scream but my mouth no longed moved to my will.

It’s been more than a week since then.

Earlier today I received a company wide e-newsletter with a picture of Sandra on the front page, informing me of her tragic passing.

Despite only being 42 and medicated for it, her heart failure issues had led to a fatal heart attack. Everyone was giving their condolences and highlighting her work and impact. 

I stared at the screen for a while. I looked up Ramipril - it's a medication used for treating heart failure.

It struck me that I didn’t remember what I’d done with the box that day. Maybe, just maybe I really was going crazy, and all of that never happened, maybe I could prove it. I didn’t want to be losing my mind, but I didn’t want to be responsible for someone’s death either. She seemed so nice.

I checked the pockets of the trousers I wore that day, they were empty, I felt momentary joy. Then I checked my suitcase to be sure, and my heart sank. I felt a hard rectangular shape under the lining. There was a cut at the side, and I held my breath as I reached in. I already knew what it was.

I don’t remember hiding it there, but there's a lot I don’t remember. I had her pill box in my hands. Cold hard proof of what had happened.

Now I know she died because of me. Her medication stopped working, just like that? It would be so easy to say I don't know for sure, but I do know I swapped those boxes. Either it was placebos in there and the heart attack was natural, or something even worse. 

I think I killed her, and the other man, i feel sick to my fucking stomach. It wasn’t my fault I swear, not the first time at least, but can I say the same for the second?

I don’t want to kill anyone, I don’t want to go to prison, I don’t want to be killed, I don't want any of this I swear to god. Make it stop. I want my life to go back to normal. Is that selfish of me?

At work now I’m afraid to drink or eat anything I haven’t made myself, or to make hot drinks for anyone. When I look at my coworkers I wonder if they’re in on this, or if they’re next to die.

I don’t know why those two people had to be killed. I looked into both of them and the only thing they have in common is being in senior positions, and being vocal about their opinions. Nothing outrageous though. 

That being said, there is one other thing. Our companies are all collaborating on a project together, which is why I came into contact with them in the first place.

Some parts of my company deal with classified information. I’ve heard of big companies with disgruntled employees whistleblowing and going missing, but I have no way of knowing if those two were involved in that kind of thing.

Plus I’m not working with anything dangerous/classified, where do I fit in all of this? Why did it have to be me?

I think writing this post has helped me process it all, since I can’t talk to anyone else, but I’m afraid they’ll find this somehow and I don’t know what would happen then.

I feel like I’m running out of time. If I try to speak up they’ve already made it clear they’ll frame me for the first man’s death. Now I’ve done something more serious and the only proof I have would incriminate me, telling the police isn’t really an option.

I could try to leave the placement but I’d need to come up with a good reason, and the people behind this might try to stop me, or worse. I can’t be sure what they even did to me in the time missing from my memories.

If anyone has any ideas of what else I could do please tell me, the only other things I can think of are far too extreme. I can’t leave the country and my family, or risk telling my coworkers and university, not that they’d even believe me.

The isolation is maddening. I don’t know how much more I can take. 

I’m afraid of what my next task will be, and if I’ll even be myself afterwards.",4,1732922346.0,nosleep,1,0.67,False

 The first cut wasn’t the deepest, but it was the one I remember most. Just above the collarbone, a flash of cold steel, and then searing heat. I remember their face—someone I trusted, some I loved—and then the sound of my own breathing, ragged and desperate. The knife was there when no one else was. It always has been.

June 17th 9:03 pm.

That’s when I bought the knife, all because it looked cool. Thirty bucks at some gas station outside the city, the kind of place with buzzing lights and the faint smell of burnt coffee. It wasn’t supposed to save me. But it did. The scar above my collarbone throbbed as I turned the blade in my hand. It was funny, almost, how something so small could decide life or death. Funny, until it wasn’t. 
I stood up from my bed, running my thumb along the blade’s edge before slipping it into my back pocket. The same pocket it’s been in for weeks—anything else felt wrong. I stepped out of my bedroom, facing a quiet house that was too big for one person. It’s been lonely ever since I left the family home. It felt more like a memory than a place now, something that existed only in pieces in my mind. They said it was time I learned to depend on myself. They didn’t understand—what it’s like to wake up every night terrified, feeling watched, feeling touched. 
The house didn’t feel like mine yet. The walls were too bare, the air too stale. I’d set up the essentials—a bed, a couch, a fridge stocked with leftovers and cheap beer—but that was it. I avoided decorating, avoided unpacking. It wasn’t worth the effort when every night felt temporary, like something—or someone—might force me to leave at any moment. The scar above my collarbone itched as I walked through the hallway. My hand brushes against the knife in my pocket. 
It didn’t matter anymore. The silence is better. It’s safer. At least, that’s what I told myself now when I caught shadows moving in the corners of my eyes, when I saw my reflection delay even by a second. It’s better. It’s safer. I was safe. The same words I’ve been telling myself for three years now, maybe just maybe I’d  start to believe them one day. 
Wandering through the hallways, my fingertips brushed the smooth walls, following their curve. The silence wrapped around me, heavy and suffocating, yes familiar. As I made my way downstairs, a single stair groaned beneath my foot—a sound it had never made before. I stopped mid-step, the air shifting, the quiet suddenly too loud. 

In the kitchen, a beer bottle caught the faint light, its shadows stretching across the counter. My pulse quickened. Did I leave that there? No, I couldn’t have. My mind scrambled to piece together the last few hours, but it was blank, or maybe I just didn’t want to remember. Before I could make sense of it, the doorbell rang. The sound ripped through the house, sharp and jarring. My body moved before I could think, my hand footing to my back pocket. The knife was there, its weight grounding me. They were out to get me. 
The doorbell rang again, each chime louder, harder to ignore. My fingers tightened around the knife, the blade cool against my palm. I moved towards the door, each step slow, deliberate, the house so quiet that I could hear my own heart beat. My arm struggles to stay up, my grip shaky, the knife nearly slipping from my hands. I leaned close to the door, holding my breath as I peeked through the peephole. My chest tightened as shadows blurred together on the other side r and then–a breath escaped, the tension rushing out of me like air from a balloon. My parents.
“Damian, darling, let us in, please. It’s your parents we brought you some food,” 

my mother said, her voice soft and sweet, like I was a child. Then came the knock. My father’s knock is sharp, impatient, rattling the door frame. 
“Son, let us in,”
 My father barked. He never could hide his irritation. He always thought I was crazy. My hand hovered near the knob, trembling just slightly. I tried to grab it, but my fingers slipped. Twice. My palms were slick. Was I sweating! I wiped them against my jeans, breath Damian. They thought I was taking too long, I know they did. They were waiting on the other side of the door, exchanging looks, whispering. 
What is he doing in there? Is he ever going to let us in? That’s what my dad would say. He didn’t get it. None of them did. I opened it anyway. The cream from the hinges was louder than I thought it would be but it cut through the silence. 
“Hi, mom. Hi, dad”
 I managed, like nothing was wrong. Mom smiled, that soft, practiced smile that she’d used my whole life, and walked in without hesitation. She carried a bag and some plates, setting them on the counter. “I made your favorite,” she said, unpacking containers like it was just another visit, like everything was fine. It wasn’t fine. 

Dad stayed by the door, arms crossed, his eyes darting around the room like he was inspecting it. Like he was inspecting me. 
“You’ve been keeping to yourself too much.” 
He said. His tone was clipped, judgmental. He didn’t even bother to hide it. 
“Your mother is worried. We both are.” 
That was a lie. He wasn’t worried. He was angry, disgusted. You can’t take concern–not with me. I’ve seen it before. Mom paused mid-motion, glancing at me. 
“I’m fine.” I said quickly. Too quickly too sound believable. 
She didn’t believe me. I could tell. 
“I mean it I’m fine I didn’t need anything.” I said looking away from my parents.
 “Damian, honey..you’re not eating enough. Look at you. Please, just let us help.” 
Her voice was as gentle, but her eyes–they gave her away. Pity. It was there I could almost smell it and I hated it. 
Despite my feelings towards my mothers pity, I didn’t say anything. What would be the point? You see how she is. My father slumped onto my couch with a groan, but not the kind you’d expect from a dad settling into his favorite chair. No, this was different. Disapproving. The kind of groan that told me everything I already knew: He hated the couch I’d chosen. It was cheap–so what? Who cares? 
“Honey, how about we sit down and talk? How have you been feeling?” My mother asked, her voice soft but loaded.
The conversation blurred in my mind, the usual rehearsed lines spilling out my mouth before I could even think about them. 
“I’m fine. Living alone is great. No, I haven’t made any neighbor friends. Yes, I’m still single.” 
My dad always sighted at the last one. It was always the same thing, usually enough to make her stop, but not this time. “Look Damian..” She shifted in her seat, her hand finding its way to my knee. That gesture, full of pity, made my stomach twist. “We made some friends at a group circle, and they have a son about your age. He’s been through..what you’re going through. But he’s doing better now. I think meeting him could help you, you could help each other you know..make some new friends.” 
Ethan. That was his name. She said it like it was some magic cure, like he was going to fix me or something. I didn’t need fixing. Her words hung there yet her eyes didn’t look at me. Meanwhile, dad sat there,choked out of his mind, staring at some invisible spot on the wall. At least he didn’t bother pretending to care. Ethan this, Ethan that–who cares? He’s just another risk. Another unknown variable in a world already full of them. “No thanks,mom,” I said 
“I’m fine on my own.” 
My mom kept talking about Ethan, but I wasn’t listening. Why would I? I didn’t plan on speaking to him, much less becoming his friend. It was pointless. Useless. I wished they would stop trying to fix me. I didn’t need fixing. I needed to be left alone. I drifted in and out of her words, my mind somewhere else entirely, until I felt the weight shift off the couch. Back to reality. 

“Bye mom. Bye dad,”

 I muttered, standing stiffly as they made their way to the door. My mom paused, her hand brushing against my hand as she leaned in and kissed my hairline. 

“We just want you to be happy. Damian,” 

she whispered, her voice dripping with that same pity I’d grown to despise. She left a small piece of paper on the counter before walking out. A name and number written in neat handwriting. Ethan. 

The name stared back at me from the paper, almost taunting. I crumpled it in my hand, but I didn’t throw it away.

1h2yn31,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/1h2yn31/crushing_on_my_boss_not_ok_with_it/,Crushing on my boss & not ok with it ,"…as of today I realized I have a crush on one of my clients & am mortified at myself for feeling this way. I hold various positions in people’s homes & this one hired me from an ad they placed in an app. Though their post had a massive response & interest, they responded to me almost immediately. Not thinking much of it at the time, nor even noting their photo, I showed up a couple days later for an interview…when he answered the door, I was taken aback. Idk his specific age, but he seemed to be around my own, maybe a handful of yrs older at most…he hired me on the spot. 

 It’s been a couple months now. Every time I’m at his place I notice something new. All of his collections & obvious hobbies, match my own. He’s single (meaning not married), owns both his home & a business, is close to his family that lives a couple of hrs away. Overall he seems to be a solid human being. 

 A couple wks ago I accidentally left my anklet behind. I took it off while I was cleaning the shower & spaced it. Embarrassed, I let him know soon after I left & he said he’d be home later that night (it was a Friday) if I wanted to come by and get it…not wanting to intrude or seem even more unprofessional (as well as house sitting that night anyways), I let him know it was ok for now. He agreed to hang on to it until I came next time & we left it at that. 

 Today I showed up & though he wasn’t supposed to be there today, he was. A few mins after I’m inside he goes “Is it hot in here, are you warm?” I let him know the temp was perf for me. He then offered me coffee & left soon after that. He’s normally gone the entire time I’m there. Today however, he came back after about a half hr. Not only that, he stayed at the house. Sometimes some clients will do this to keep an eye on their in home employees, but it wasn’t that kind of vibe at all. He started washing his car, doing yard work etc. He always let me know I could put music on, so I had. Letting my guard down I started singing. Throughout my time there today, he kept making small talk & cracking jokes. He turned on a football game & muted it, so I could still enjoy my music & singing. Honestly, the energy overall was very homely, nice…it didn’t feel like any other job I’ve had. 

…then I noticed my anklet was still exactly where I left it. Normally clients will set things left behind aside, on a table near the door or something like that, but there it was, in a somewhat intimate space. When I left today, he also paid me more than I billed for. Which was way rad, but again, not a typical thing for clients to randomly do. Overall I’m kind of a mess about this. It’s one of the easiest homes I’ve had & he’s SO damn nice. I’m legitimately atp wondering if I need to get a therapist or something because who crushes on their boss like I am?? I’m not like this at all & feel incredibly lame for borderline fantasizing about him after I left today…WILDLY inappropriate of me. 

 So, now I’m contemplating WTF to do about this. Do I make up some reason to quit? Or should I just keep working for him in hopes this goes away? The whole thing is just so damn awkward…& it really doesn’t help that this guy is incredibly attractive, too. Overall I just feel so damn immature rn…what would you do?? Please help!

How can I show genuine interest without making some feel pressured/rushed? :(,"Hey guys! This might be a long story, but I need some different perspectives.

About a month ago, I went to a local bar with some friends and noticed a presence in the space. Have you ever entered a place and just felt like someone was staring at you? Well, there was this cute bartender that I kept catching glimpses of, and I noticed she was paying attention to me. Noticing her noticing me made me notice her more, and there was just this lingering presence in the air.

Every time I went to the bar, she was the one helping me out, and every time I needed something, I’d look for her. At the end of the night, she came over and said I looked familiar (even though we’d never met). I told her I didn’t recognize her, but what I did know was that she was gorgeous. She responded well to the compliment, and for some reason—despite not being the kind of person who does this—I asked for her number. I don’t like making people uncomfortable, and even for me, asking someone out like that is awkward, but with her, I just said ""fuck it"" it just felt right.

At the end of the night, she gave me her number, and I sent her a text. She responded, and the next day, we had a general conversation over text. Again, that same day I stepped out of my comfort zone and asked her out for coffee or lunch. Normally, I hate getting to know people over text, and I feel like I communicate better in person, so I thought this was the best way to get to know her. It was kind of my version of speed dating.

She took a few days to get back to me, but eventually, she said yes. We talked a bit throughout the week, and then we met on Saturday. The ""date,"" if you can call it that, went really well. She’s chatty (like me), smart, and easy to talk to. What started as a coffee date turned into lunch and more. We spent hours together, talking, walking around the neighborhood, and exploring some shops. I even showed her a couple of my favorite spots, like a candle shop and a clothing store, and we both ended up buying a few things. In total, we spent over three hours together, and by the end, I was sure she was interested in me.

A few days later, eager to see her I asked her out again. We talked about how busy her schedule is—she has two jobs and works every day—while I’m a recent grad with a 9-5. We agreed to meet in the mornings or around noon since that worked best for her. We made plans for the following Saturday, but the night before, she had a really bad car accident (she's physically fine). Understandably, she canceled, and I was fine with that.

But after that day, things started to feel different. I blame it on the accident. We kept texting and often had long phone calls—once, we even talked for four hours straight. From my perspective, we were connecting deeply, and I found myself falling for her quickly. I’m the kind of person who loses interest fast if someone doesn’t excite me, but with her, it felt different.

When I like someone, I don’t play games or pretend I’m uninterested. I make it clear through my actions. For example, after her accident, she mentioned how inconvenient and costly it was to rely on Uber now that her car was totaled. I sent her some money—not a lot, just enough to I cared, and to cheer her up and help with a ride or two.

I also tried inviting her to spend time together the weekend after her accident. She said she wasn’t feeling very ""datey,"" which I completely understood. I offered to pick her up and help with errands instead, so we could just hang out without pressure. She appreciated the gesture and said it was sweet but declined, not wanting to burden me since I also had errands to run that day.

Even though we weren’t meeting in person, we kept getting to know each other through texts and calls. Then, a few weeks ago, I asked her to be my date for my company’s Christmas gala. She hesitated at first, saying she thought I might have other “prospects,” but I reassured her that she was the only one I was interested in. After some thought, she agreed to go.

Around the same time, because of the accident she told me she was planning to quit one of her jobs after the week ended, which would give her weekends free. Seeing this as an opportunity, I invited her to a friend’s Christmas party. My intention was just to see how she’d do in that setting just as a friend, or something that I'm seeing/talking to. But she expressed concern that the party was a bit much for where we were, comparing it to the gala, which she said felt more intimate and low-pressure.

Over the next week, I noticed she started pulling back a bit. While she still answered my calls, and she would call me on her own our conversations grew shorter. I tried not to overthink it, blaming it on her busy schedule. Last Tuesday, we had our last proper long conversation. We talked about lots of things, including whether she wanted to go to my friend's party and what we’d wear to the gala. I mentioned I wanted to buy a suit and suggested meeting over the weekend for brunch so she could help me pick one out. She liked the idea, and that was the last time we had a lengthy conversation.

Since then, she’s seemed more distant. Noticing this, I tried calling her more often. Yesterday, when I followed up to confirm our weekend plans, she called me. She said things were moving too fast for her, and that I was in a space that she's not yet in (I'm pretty much getting ahead of her), she brought up the conversation about meeting my friends. She also mentioned an instance when I asked for a picture of her to show my mom. She had mentioned once that her mom knew about me, so thought asking for a picture to show my mom was a natural step. But she said this made her feel pressured, too.

She explained that after the accident, her mind has been all over the place. She’s been trying to focus on herself more and wanted to clarify where she stood before things got more serious. She said she values taking things slow and letting them grow naturally. For her, the idea of getting to know someone as they are, without the pressure of future expectations, is more important than starting with the intention of building a relationship.

I understand she’s been under a lot of stress and maybe I didn’t fully realize how my excitement could come across as pressure during this time.

We ended up talking for hours again. The first part of the conversation was spent addressing her concerns, and the rest was more lighthearted, just random topics like we used to. She mentioned we can stay in contact and even get coffee from time to time, but just as friends and without any expectations.

The bar where she works is also starting to become a favorite (their old fashioned is amazing), and I mentioned I was thinking of going tonight. She said I shouldn’t let this stop me from going there.

I’m not sure what to do or if I did anything wrong. Trust me, I know I can be a bit persistent, and I don’t shy away from showing when I’m excited, but it sucks knowing that I might have scared her away. It’s been three years since my last relationship, and while I’ve tried dating, I’m not the kind of person to ""hook up."" It’s just not my thing. I’ve been looking patiently for someone and hadn’t met anyone who excited me like she does, so yeah, I’m kind of stuck.

Should I let her go? Stop communicating?Should I give her space and let her come to me if she’s interested? Or would reaching out with no expectations—for the gala or otherwise—still be worth trying? :( ",1,1732922056.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

Just beyond Oyon I reached the new highest pass of my life: +16,300ft [4,968m]. Locals here blockaded the road in protest against mining activity, so the peak had been subsequently abandoned. I’d prepared for the cold weather, but even after months across the Andes these extreme elevations devoured my strength. It took everything I had to haul my bike over the makeshift stone walls and continue down the other side.

They are both abusive assholes, as seen in the Cosmic Toast era of YFM and most specifically YFMTS. And they are both fatherless.

Clearly, Puff is Ray's self-insert for his gay fantasy that is YFM. YFM has many gay moments, almost all of them including Puff in some way or another.

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

1h2yap6,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1h2yap6/does_she_or_does_she_not_notice_me/,Does she or does she not notice me ,"I’m 33M in a self made no sense situation. 3yrs married 10 together 31F and trying for first kid but diagnosed with unexplained fertility 

During this time been doing a long degree and three years ago met my LO 23F at uni and over this time we bonded 

We would hang out in class at first, then we moved to doing exam practice together alone most the time and we sailed through two years of the course. 

My wife and I went to her house , met her family and broke bread. Her mum didn’t seem to give me much eye contact but my wife schmoozed the room and everyone seemed to get on okay. End of the evening we offer to drop LO’s best mate from high school home but she refused and stayed. My wife felt later that the girls wanted to talk about us but I think she was dramatic. 

To celebrate exams I took LO to fancy restaurant and we planned this year to do optional modules together. My wife got concerned that one module is abroad and I shouldn’t be encouraged to go with her so I’m staying at home. 

My wife offered to tutor us both for exams last year but we only managed one afternoon session as LO felt she was being slowed down as my wife who’s qualified (but particular in her manner) was being very pedantic about communication skills over content. We still managed to both pass.

During summer I messaged her about her trip and mine and my wife read the messages- I deleted her old ones as it’s a lot of heart messages and us arranging private study sessions. My wife was like don’t flirt with her as I called myself tasty in reference to a cow charging at me n my wife. So I started a plan to slow try phase her out so less direct messages and no memes 

Now we are in similar classes this year and we were doing okay. I visited her new residence, had a tea, went out for brunch once and dropped her homehome once - 2hr car journey. We swapped modules and I thought I should give her space and myself to try ease my own limerance… as sometimes when I hang with LO it’s just so so fun I wish I could do it more. 3weeks go past NC and then I see her last week at classes. 

She giving me heavy ex gf energy, first day she seems flustered and rushes of in front when normally she would walk by my side and we would get coffee or something. she doesn’t say hi, doesn’t want to partner up (extremely unlike her) and when I speak to her she looks like a deer in headlights and very stressed. Given her attitude I leave early and she’s drops me a messages saying let’s do exam practice with a friend next day- I agree. Next day we have a trio revision session and she happy and herself with the other girl but blunt and avoiding eye contact with me but we bumble through - she then runs off again.  I drop her a message to check she’s okay and she claims she just busy. We have a little bit of exam only discussion on WhatsApp now. But she seemed so different this last week - wtf has changed? Am I naive in believing she has feelings? Or has the NC time allowed her to realise we need some boundaries?

Throughout all of this since the second meeting I have been infatuated with this girl. She sparkled in like psychedelic lighting that day and I knew I either will be obsessed with her or I should never speak to her in respect to my wife. But I was like hey why not have the prettiest girl in the class as a friend and I’m 10yrs older- I can handle this without any feelings 

I have been so so wrong - I check my phone constantly and message back instantly- most times I get a reply back in a day or two but I am obsessed with any reciprocation and love when she’s online and we have longer talks. Last month though was 3 weeks NC and now this hot/cold business I’m so confused for last two years she’s been so platonic and enthusiastic but now she’s distant and claiming to be busy. 

Why am I so obsessed- I know there is no possibility of any relationship and she’s Muslim so very conservative but we talk a lot about her concerns of never kissing a boy and what sex entails but this is on her end- I just giggle along and tell her all will be fine. She’s never shown interest in me and I thought we had developed a bond and I just had a crush but this is constant intrusive thoughts over the last three years. I don’t think a day goes without me thinking about her. I get upset when she doesn’t reply and I made any excuse to go uni to see her 

What can I do? I love my wife but I’m constantly thinking oh what if I did this with LO. I feel so much guilt and feel angry simultaneously that LO is so self centered but she should be - she owes me nothing I can’t give her true love I can just pedestal her and admire from afar 

No sexual stuff has happened between us but earlier on I thought she was just Uber friendly with me and now my memories are twisted thinking we had some flirting going on - once the teacher had to tell us off as LO kept interrupting the discussion to bother me. 

wtf guys! wtf am I doing!?! why do I keep bother her on WhatsApp!?! Why is my brain like this!?! Why can’t I crave my wife like this!?! I never knew I could be so easily swayed by someone so young and recent in my life. I just miss LO so much all the time and I hate this weird state we are in 

Any advice appreciated- I’m a guilty husband and I’m trying to be better but this woman has some other magic on me - please help this self inflicted idiot ",3,1732921230.0,limerence,2,1.0,False

**Introduction**

Hey there, startup founders and marketers! Let's talk about something that's probably keeping you up at night: how to get more bang for your buck with your content marketing. I know, I know, you're pouring your heart and soul (and maybe your life savings) into your startup, and you want to make sure every penny counts. Well, you're in luck because I've got some easy tricks up my sleeve that'll help you boost your content marketing ROI without breaking the bank or losing your mind.

Now, before we dive in, let me tell you a little secret: these hacks aren't just random tips I found on the internet. They're tried-and-true methods that have worked for countless startups, including some I've helped myself. And the best part? They're all about working smarter, not harder. So, grab a coffee (or your beverage of choice), get comfy, and let's get started on revolutionizing your content marketing game!

# 1. Know Your Audience Deeply

Alright, first things first: you've got to know who you're talking to. I mean, really know them. It's like trying to buy a birthday gift for someone you've never met – chances are, you're going to miss the mark. The same goes for your content. If you don't know your audience inside and out, how can you expect to create stuff they'll love?

**Create detailed buyer personas with AI tools to analyze customer data**

Now, I know what you're thinking: ""But I don't have time to deep-dive into customer data!"" Well, here's where technology comes to the rescue. There are some pretty cool AI tools out there that can help you analyze your customer data and create detailed buyer personas. These aren't just vague sketches – we're talking about in-depth profiles that tell you everything from your audience's favorite social media platforms to the kind of content they engage with most.

For example, you could use a tool like IBM Watson Analytics or Google Analytics with its AI capabilities. These tools can crunch through mountains of data and give you insights you might never have spotted on your own. They can tell you things like which topics get the most engagement, what time of day your audience is most active, and even predict future trends based on past behavior.

But don't just rely on the machines. Use these insights as a starting point, then add your own human touch. Talk to your customers, send out surveys, and really listen to what they're saying. The more you know about your audience, the better you can tailor your content to their needs and interests.

**Use AI-driven insights to identify where your audience spends their time online**

Once you've got a good handle on who your audience is, the next step is figuring out where they hang out online. Are they Instagram addicts? LinkedIn professionals? Reddit lurkers? Knowing this can help you focus your efforts where they'll have the most impact.

Again, AI can be a huge help here. Tools like Sprout Social or Hootsuite Insights use AI to analyze social media data and give you a clear picture of where your audience is most active. They can even tell you what kind of content performs best on each platform.

But here's the kicker: don't just stick to the obvious places. Your audience might surprise you. Maybe they're super active in niche forums or Slack communities. Or perhaps they're early adopters of new platforms. Keep an open mind and be willing to explore new territories. Remember, it's better to be a big fish in a small pond than to get lost in the ocean of content on oversaturated platforms.

# 2. Set Clear Goals with AI Assistance

Now that you know who you're talking to and where to find them, it's time to figure out what you want to achieve. Without clear goals, you're basically throwing spaghetti at the wall and hoping something sticks. And let's face it, that's not the most efficient use of your time or resources.

**Define specific, measurable objectives for your content strategy**

When it comes to setting goals, you want to be as specific as possible. None of this vague ""increase brand awareness"" stuff. I'm talking about concrete, measurable objectives. For example:

* Increase website traffic by 25% in the next quarter
* Generate 100 new leads per month through content downloads
* Boost email newsletter sign-ups by 50% in the next six months

See how these goals are specific and measurable? That's what you're aiming for. This way, you can clearly track your progress and know whether your efforts are paying off.

But how do you come up with these goals? This is where AI can lend a hand again.

**Utilize AI to analyze past performance and guide future content planning**

AI tools can analyze your past content performance and help you set realistic yet ambitious goals. For instance, tools like BrightEdge or Crayon use AI to analyze your content's historical performance and compare it to industry benchmarks. They can suggest goals based on your current trajectory and what's achievable in your industry.

These tools can also help you identify which types of content are most likely to help you reach your goals. Maybe your how-to guides are great for generating leads, while your opinion pieces drive more traffic. Armed with this knowledge, you can plan your content strategy more effectively.

But remember, while AI can provide valuable insights, it's up to you to set goals that align with your overall business objectives. Don't just chase numbers for the sake of it. Make sure your content goals are supporting your broader business strategy.

# 3. Leverage AI for Content Ideation

Okay, so you know your audience and you've set your goals. Now comes the fun part: coming up with content ideas. But let's be real, some days the ideas just don't flow, right? We've all been there, staring at a blank screen, wondering where all our creativity went. Well, guess what? AI can help with that too!

**Use AI tools to generate content ideas based on trending topics and audience interests**

There are some pretty nifty AI tools out there that can help you come up with content ideas. Tools like BuzzSumo or Concured use AI to analyze trending topics in your industry and suggest content ideas that are likely to resonate with your audience.

These tools don't just look at what's trending now. They can also predict upcoming trends based on historical data and current patterns. This means you can stay ahead of the curve and create content that your audience will be looking for before they even know they want it.

But here's a pro tip: don't just blindly follow what the AI suggests. Use it as a springboard for your own creativity. Maybe the AI suggests a topic about ""10 best productivity apps for startups."" You could take that idea and put your own spin on it, like ""5 unconventional productivity hacks that saved my startup.""

**Analyze competitors with AI to find gaps in your niche that you can fill**

Another great way to come up with content ideas is to look at what your competitors are doing – or more importantly, what they're not doing. AI tools like SEMrush or Ahrefs can analyze your competitors' content strategies and identify gaps that you could fill.

For example, maybe your competitors are all focusing on beginner-level content, leaving an opportunity for you to create more advanced, in-depth pieces. Or perhaps they're all writing blog posts, but no one's creating video content. These gaps are your chance to stand out and provide unique value to your audience.

But remember, it's not about copying your competitors. It's about finding opportunities to offer something different and valuable. Use the AI insights as a starting point, then brainstorm ways to put your unique stamp on the content. Your audience will appreciate your fresh perspective!

# 4. Diversify Content Formats with AI Insights

Now, let's talk about shaking things up a bit. You know the saying, ""variety is the spice of life""? Well, it's true for content marketing too. If you're stuck in a rut of churning out the same type of content over and over, it's time to mix things up.

**Experiment with various formats (blogs, videos, infographics) based on AI-driven audience preferences**

Here's where AI can be your secret weapon again. Tools like Socialbakers or Sprout Social can analyze your audience's engagement patterns and tell you what types of content they prefer. Maybe your audience loves quick, snackable video content. Or perhaps they're more into in-depth, long-form articles. AI can help you figure this out.

But don't stop at just blogs and videos. There's a whole world of content formats out there:

* Infographics
* Podcasts
* Interactive quizzes
* Webinars
* Ebooks
* Social media stories

The key is to experiment and see what resonates with your audience. And here's a little secret: sometimes, the format that works best might surprise you. I once worked with a B2B tech company that thought their audience only wanted serious, text-heavy white papers. Turns out, their most successful piece of content was a fun, interactive quiz!

**Utilize AI to repurpose successful content across multiple channels efficiently**

Now, here's a hack that'll save you tons of time and effort: repurposing content. Let's say you've created an awesome, in-depth blog post that's getting lots of traction. Don't let it stop there! You can turn that single piece of content into multiple formats:

* Pull out key stats and create an infographic
* Use the main points to create a video script
* Turn the content into a slideshow for LinkedIn
* Extract snippets for social media posts

AI tools like Lately or Repurpose.io can help you automate this process. They can analyze your original content, identify the most engaging parts, and even generate new content in different formats.

But here's the thing: don't just copy and paste. Each platform has its own quirks and best practices. What works on LinkedIn might not fly on TikTok. Use AI to get started, but always add your human touch to make sure the content feels native to each platform.

# 5. Enhance Content Quality Through AI Tools

Alright, now let's talk about quality. Because let's face it, in the world of content marketing, quality trumps quantity every time. You could be pumping out content left and right, but if it's not top-notch, you're just adding to the noise. So how can AI help you level up your content game?

**Use AI-powered grammar and style checkers to improve writing quality**

First things first: let's talk about the basics. Good grammar and style are non-negotiable. But we're all human, and sometimes mistakes slip through. That's where AI-powered writing assistants come in handy.

Tools like Grammarly or ProWritingAid don't just catch typos. They can help you improve your sentence structure, suggest better word choices, and even adapt your writing style to your target audience. For example, if you're writing for a professional audience, these tools can help you strike the right tone – formal enough to be taken seriously, but not so stuffy that it puts people to sleep.

But here's a word of caution: don't rely on these tools completely. They're great for catching obvious errors and improving readability, but they don't understand context like a human does. Always give your content a final human review to make sure it sounds natural and conveys your intended message.

**Implement AI tools for SEO optimization and keyword analysis to boost visibility**

Now, let's talk about getting your awesome content in front of more eyeballs. SEO is crucial, but it can be a bit of a dark art. Luckily, AI can help demystify it.

Tools like Clearscope or MarketMuse use AI to analyze top-ranking content for your target keywords and give you insights on how to optimize your own content. They can suggest related keywords to include, recommend content length, and even give you ideas for subtopics to cover.

But remember, SEO isn't just about stuffing keywords into your content. It's about creating valuable, relevant content that answers your audience's questions. Use AI tools to guide your SEO strategy, but always prioritize creating content that genuinely helps your readers.

Here's a pro tip: use AI to identify question-based keywords that your audience is searching for. Then, create content that directly answers these questions. This can help you rank for featured snippets – those coveted ""position zero"" results at the top of Google search results.

# 6. Personalize Content Experiences with AI

Okay, let's get personal. In today's world, one-size-fits-all content just doesn't cut it anymore. Your audience expects content that speaks directly to their needs and interests. But how can you possibly create personalized content for every single reader? Enter AI.

**Deploy AI algorithms to deliver personalized content recommendations to users**

Think about how Netflix suggests shows you might like based on what you've watched before. Or how Spotify creates personalized playlists just for you. That's the kind of personalization we're talking about, but for your content.

AI-powered content recommendation engines can analyze a user's behavior on your site – what articles they read, how long they spend on each page, what topics they seem most interested in – and then suggest other pieces of content they might enjoy. Tools like Personyze or Dynamic Yield can help you implement this kind of personalization on your site.

But here's the really cool part: these tools can learn and improve over time. The more a user interacts with your content, the better the recommendations become. It's like having a super-smart librarian who gets to know each reader's tastes and always has the perfect book recommendation.

**Use segmentation strategies informed by AI to tailor content for different audience groups**

Now, let's take personalization a step further. Instead of just recommending existing content, what if you could create content tailored to specific segments of your audience?

AI can help you identify distinct segments within your audience based on factors like behavior, demographics, interests, and even purchase history. Tools like Segment or Optimizely use AI to create these segments automatically.

Once you have these segments, you can create content specifically tailored to each group. For example, if you're a fitness app, you might create different content for:

* Beginners just starting their fitness journey
* Advanced users looking for challenging workouts
* Users interested in nutrition and meal planning
* Users focused on weight loss

By tailoring your content to these specific segments, you're more likely to create stuff that really resonates with each group. And when your content hits the mark, your audience is more likely to engage, share, and keep coming back for more.

But here's a word of caution: don't go overboard with segmentation. You don't want to end up creating so many different versions of your content that you spread yourself too thin. Use AI to identify your most important segments, and focus on creating high-quality, tailored content for these key groups.

# 7. Implement AI for Performance Measurement

Alright, we've talked about creating great content, but how do you know if it's actually working? This is where measuring performance comes in. And guess what? AI can make this process a whole lot easier and more insightful.

**Track KPIs using AI analytics tools to gain deeper insights into content performance**

First off, let's talk about Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). These are the metrics that tell you whether your content is hitting the mark or missing by a mile. Common content marketing KPIs include:

* Page views
* Time on page
* Bounce rate
* Social shares
* Conversion rate
* Return on Investment (ROI)

Now, you could track these manually, but that would be a huge time-suck. Instead, why not let AI do the heavy lifting? Tools like Google Analytics with its AI capabilities or Tableau with its predictive analytics can track these KPIs automatically and present them in easy-to-understand dashboards.

But here's where AI really shines: it can uncover insights that might not be obvious at first glance. For example, it might notice that posts published on Tuesdays get more engagement, or that articles over 2000 words have a higher conversion rate. These are the kind of insights that can help you fine-tune your strategy for better results.

**Use predictive analytics to foresee trends and adjust your strategy proactively**

Now, let's take it a step further. What if you could predict how your content will perform before you even publish it? That's where predictive analytics comes in.

AI-powered predictive analytics tools like Cortex or Albert.ai can analyze your historical data and industry trends to forecast how future content might perform. They can predict things like:

* Which topics are likely to trend in the coming months
* What types of content are likely to get the most engagement
* When the best times to publish will be

Armed with these predictions, you can adjust your content strategy proactively. Maybe you decide to create more content on a topic that's predicted to trend, or you shift your publishing schedule to take advantage of peak engagement times.

But here's the thing: while predictive analytics can be incredibly powerful, it's not a crystal ball. Use it as a guide, but don't be afraid to trust your gut too. Sometimes the most successful content is the stuff that goes against the grain and surprises everyone.

# 8. Engage Your Audience through AI-Driven Interactions

Now, let's talk about turning your content marketing from a one-way street into a two-way conversation. Engagement is key to building a loyal audience, and AI can help you foster meaningful interactions at scale.

**Incorporate chatbots for real-time engagement and feedback collection**

Chatbots have come a long way from the clunky, frustrating experiences of the past. Today's AI-powered chatbots can engage in natural conversations, answer questions, and even inject a bit of personality into their interactions.

Tools like MobileMonkey or ManyChat allow you to create chatbots that can:

* Answer frequently asked questions about your content
* Suggest relevant articles based on a user's interests
* Collect feedback on your content
* Guide users through your site to find the information they need

But here's the key: don't try to pass off your chatbot as a human. Be upfront that it's an AI assistant. People appreciate honesty, and they'll be more forgiving if the bot occasionally misunderstands or can't answer a question.

Also, make sure there's always an option to connect with a real person if needed. The goal is to enhance human interaction, not replace it entirely.

**Use AI to analyze comments and interactions to foster community discussions**

Comments and discussions around your content can be goldmines of insights and engagement. But managing these conversations, especially at scale, can be challenging. This is where AI can lend a hand.

AI-powered tools like Disqus or Spot.IM can help you:

* Automatically moderate comments to filter out spam and inappropriate content
* Identify trending topics in your comment sections
* Highlight the most engaging comments
* Suggest relevant articles to commenters based on their interests

But don't just let the AI run the show. Use these insights to actively participate in the discussions. Respond to comments, ask follow-up questions, and encourage further conversation. This not only boosts engagement but also helps you build a community around your content.

Here's a pro tip: use AI to identify your most engaged commenters or community members. These are your potential brand advocates. Consider reaching out to them personally, thanking them for their contributions, and maybe even inviting them to participate in exclusive content or events.

# 9. Build Relationships with AI-Enhanced Outreach

Alright, let's talk about taking your content beyond your own platforms and building relationships with your audience wherever they are. This is where outreach comes in, and yes, AI can help make this process more effective and efficient too.

**Automate email marketing campaigns with AI to nurture leads effectively**

Email marketing is still one of the most effective ways to nurture leads and build relationships with your audience. But let's face it, managing email campaigns can be time-consuming and complex. This is where AI can be a game-changer.

AI-powered email marketing tools like Mailchimp or Drip can help you:

* Segment your email list based on user behavior and preferences
* Personalize email content for different segments
* Optimize send times for each individual recipient
* A/B test different subject lines and content to see what resonates best

But here's the really cool part: some advanced AI tools can even generate email content based on your brand voice and the recipient's preferences. Tools like Phrasee or Persado use AI to create email subject lines and body copy that are optimized for engagement.

Remember though, while AI can help automate and optimize your email campaigns, it's important to maintain a human touch. Use AI-generated content as a starting point, but always review and refine it to ensure it aligns with your brand voice and provides real value to your readers.

**Use AI to track and respond to social media interactions, enhancing your brand's approachability**

Social media is where many of your audience members spend a significant portion of their online time. It's a great place to share your content, but more importantly, it's an opportunity to engage in conversations and build relationships.

AI-powered social media management tools like Sprout Social or Hootsuite can help you:

* Monitor mentions of your brand across multiple platforms
* Identify posts that require a response
* Suggest appropriate responses based on the context and sentiment of the post
* Schedule posts at optimal times for engagement

But here's the key: don't just use these tools to broadcast your content. Use them to listen and engage in meaningful conversations. Respond to comments, ask questions, and show the human side of your brand.

Pro tip: Use AI to identify influencers or micro-influencers in your niche who are engaging with your content. These could be potential partners for collaborations or guest content opportunities. Reach out to them personally (not with an AI-generated message!) and start building a relationship.

# 10. Iterate and Innovate with AI Feedback Loops

Alright, we've covered a lot of ground, but here's the thing about content marketing: it's not a ""set it and forget it"" kind of deal. The most successful content strategies are those that continuously evolve based on what's working and what's not. And guess what? AI can help you stay on top of this ongoing process.

**Regularly assess content effectiveness with AI tools to identify areas for improvement**

The beauty of digital content is that you can get real-time feedback on how it's performing. But with so much data available, it can be overwhelming to figure out what it all means. This is where AI analytics tools come in handy.

Tools like ContentSquare or Amplitude use AI to analyze user behavior on your site and provide insights on how to improve your content. They can tell you things like:

* Which parts of your content users are engaging with most
* Where users are dropping off
* Which CTAs are most effective
* How different segments of your audience interact with your content differently

But here's the important part: don't just collect this data. Use it to make real improvements to your content strategy. Maybe you find out that your audience prefers shorter paragraphs, or that they engage more with content that includes personal anecdotes. Use these insights to refine your content creation process.

**Stay ahead of the curve by using AI to analyze emerging trends and adapt your content strategy accordingly**

The world of content marketing moves fast. What worked yesterday might not work tomorrow. But how can you stay ahead of the curve? Once again, AI can help.

AI-powered trend analysis tools like Crayon or Trendspottr can monitor millions of online sources to identify emerging trends in your industry. They can alert you to:

* Rising topics of interest in your niche
* Changes in how your audience is consuming content
* New platforms or channels where your audience is spending time
* Shifts in language or terminology used in your industry

By staying on top of these trends, you can adapt your content strategy to meet your audience where they are, with the content they're looking for.

But remember, don't chase every trend. Use your human judgment to decide which trends align with your brand and are likely to resonate with your specific audience. The goal is to be proactive and relevant, not to jump on every bandwagon that comes along.

# My Final Thought

Whew! We've covered a lot of ground, haven't we? From knowing your audience inside out to staying ahead of trends, we've explored ten powerful ways AI can supercharge your content marketing ROI. But here's the thing: all these AI tools and techniques are just that – tools. They're not magic wands that will suddenly make your content marketing wildly successful.

The real magic happens when you combine these AI-powered insights and capabilities with your own creativity, expertise, and understanding of your brand and audience. AI can crunch the numbers, spot the patterns, and even help with some of the heavy lifting. But it's you – the human behind the strategy – who brings the vision, the empathy, and the authentic voice that truly connects with your audience.

So, as you start implementing these hacks, remember to always keep your audience at the heart of everything you do. Use AI to enhance your content marketing, not to replace the human touch that makes your brand unique. Experiment, learn, and don't be afraid to try new things. The world of content marketing is always evolving, and the brands that thrive are those that evolve with it.

Now, it's your turn. Take these hacks, make them your own, and go create some amazing content that not only boosts your ROI but also truly resonates with your audience. You've got this!

1h2y84c,https://www.reddit.com/r/GayBroTeens/comments/1h2y84c/got_a_boyfriend_now/,GOT A BOYFRIEND NOW 🤭🤭,"So A few weeks ago I made a post about how there is this boy in my school that could potentially become my boyfriend.
Well, it's official now (has been since Wednesday last week actually) I HAVE A BOYFRIEND >:33
We went on a trip/date last week together and drove to a bigger city in our area (via train). And there we bought some Vinyls mainly because we both collect them. And I wrote him a poem beforehand, which I don't have anymore because he now has the only copy but thats beside the point, it was a Sonnet and I used the last two lines to ask if he wanted to become my boyfriend. And on our way back to the train station we got some coffee and there I slipped him the poem with his cup.
He wouldn't open it, but kept holding it in bis hand and wouldn't let go 😭
So on the train ride back (we cuddled the whole time too <3) I grabbed his hands and opened it for him. And he read it while laying with in my arms and my heart was beating like crazy. And when he was finished he turned around and exclaimed ""Ofcourse"" and gave a another kiss :3
And when he had to leave I also gave him a rose that I got before we went on the trip and kept throughout the whole day.
That was last Wednesday. AND I HAVE A BOYFRIEND NOW >:33

It still feels so surreal, but I am incredibly happy and I love him with all my heart.",31,1732921028.0,GayBroTeens,7,1.0,False
1h2y83f,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Royal_Juice2987/comments/1h2y83f/emotional_scars_from_experience_with_a_boyfriend/,Emotional scars from experience with a boyfriend I had when I was 15/16,"Hi,

I don't really know what I'm hoping to gain from this post really. I'm 34/F, I got married last year and have been in a very happy loving relationship for 9 years now :)

Prior to this I had quite a serious long term relationship age 17-25. It was probably my first love, a relationship I grew out of but stayed in until it became unbelievably toxic and came to an end after years of never being settled and just not being right for each other at all. 

The issue I'm talking about in the subject of this post relates to a very short term 'boyfriend' I had between the age of 15-16. Most of this odd relationship was friendship (from my naive point of view), and I was so naive I don't think I ever really knew the damage I was allowing to happen, and how it would affect me down the line or even just realising how bloody wrong it was.

I grew up with both parents in a good relationship, both cared about me a lot and I had siblings and a lot of hobbies and friends. I was a pretty teenager in the popular crowd at school but I feel like I was so dumb to fall prey to this idiot of a boy. 

For some reason it became important to me to have a 'boyfriend' and it was important to be to behave and seem like an adult even though I was quite clearly a child.

The boy in question made his way around many of my friends, and was about 18 months older than me / in the school year above. He wasn't at all good looking, he was a little bit rough, and from what I now know as an adult he was a narcissist in the making. 

He seemed to be sort of abusing many girls in my friendship group, all the while convincing us to keep it a secret for one reason or another. It came out after a long time and I think he laid some pretty rocky foundations for myself and other girls when it came to future relationships and trusting boys / men. 

I haven't really ever discussed this with anyone except for some of my friends who were involved with him too, and my sister but weirdly his actions bother me more as I get older, and not so much when I was younger. 

When I was 15 and he was I think 16/17, he put in some serious work into making me believe I was attracted to him and wanted him, even though even thinking back I always thought he was below average and I think I somehow convinced myself he was worth liking because he liked me - some serious self esteem issues or just sheer dumbfuckery going on I know. 

He had been in a relationship with one of my friends for about a year which was a lifetime at that age. He broke up with her randomly and messed with her head so much. They seemed over and he began targeting other people - just looking for new challenges clearly. 

He seemed to be addicted to porn even at that age back in the 2000's. He had loads of weird DVD's that he would pretty much force me to watch with him. He convinced me to lose my virginity to him at 15 and although looking back nothing happened that would have got me pregnant but I panicked and told my mum, who was really upset and took me to get the morning after pill. She was obviously really funny about me seeing him after that so I began lying to her about where I was going etc. 

He convinced me we never had sex as it didn't last very long so I couldn't tell anyone I'd had sex for the first time and he wasn't counting it either (he told all his friends). 

In a large group at a cinema, he forced my friend into something underneath a coat in the dark. He later took advantage of her vulnerabilities, wormed his way in with her and had sex with her too...
For clarity, she was raped on a holiday in Tenerife by a bar man and she confided in him, and he made this false safe space to make her feel loved and then just slept with her for his own perverted desires. 

To be quick about it, he basically told me what I felt and what I thought. The actual relationship element was only 3 months but I never loved him, felt nothing  when I ended it eventually, most of the time felt repulsed by him and would often have Sunday scaries that I didn't want to go near him again and yet he would be on the phone to me constantly telling me I wasn't in my right mind etc and I just believed him? It's crazy because I am fiercely strong willed, very feminist and don't take any shit from anyone as an adult but I look back and think my innocence was taken from me far too young. 

To go through some stuff quickly, in that time he made me have sex with him naked on his dads coffee table whilst his friends were all upstairs gaming and he seemed to be high from smoking weed. I didn't want to but he was quite persistent I carried on. 

Before we were in a relationship at all he forced his hands into my jeans on a minibus when we were with friends and put his fingers inside me even though I was frozen and didn't want that... and was too scared to make a scene. 

He punched a wall through once when I left his house to be with my friends (all I really cared about back then and that's how it should be!), got me to have baths with him, do all kinds of sexual stuff, got me to try anal (unsuccessfully) at 16, was obsessed with trying to make me 'squirt' as he'd seen on porn before and he would just become more sexually aggressive trying to make me do that. 

I remember once I was 15 and due to go to a drama class I did at 7:30pm after school and he came to my house and my mum and dad just thought he was my friend popping in for an hour before I went to my hobby. To be fair so did I as this was the first time we'd ever been indoors together alone. He absolutely reeked of aftershave and I was playing on my laptop being innocent and he kept laughing at me. He ended up kissing me, forcing my pants off whilst my whole family were in the house and repeatedly inserting his fingers into me, I hated it and it was so painful and uncomfortable and yet I said nothing. I went to my drama class and I was so sore I lied and said I was vomiting and sat in the toilet the whole class until my mum came and picked me up. My privates had swollen to like actual balloons and I just remember showering with freezing cold water and trying to get the swelling to go down... I remember searching my mums cabinets for some cream that would make it go away. That really scared me and I just avoided him completely for 2 weeks and all he could say was ""you've been weird since that day""... no shit!

All very messed up and warped. He's married now and I don't know how his seemingly lovely wife is with such a sadist. I saw him at a friends engagement party in 2017 and that's the only time I've seen him in about 18 years and he was surrounded by girls he had messed with and he was quite sheepish and seemed ashamed. 

I sometimes want to send him a message via Facebook and tell him he needs fucking therapy. Nobody knows the full extent of this and I don't know how he's made it this far in life without getting into trouble with the police. Don't really know how to clear my mind of it all. I feel really embarrassed that 15/16 year old me let this happen when current me wouldn't get anywhere near this kind of dysfunction.  

I wasn't scared of him really and I regularly stood up to him... but when it came to sexual stuff why did I just think that's what we do? That women just take this stuff?

1h2y7e0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/1h2y7e0/complete_healing_with_yogic_practice/,Complete healing with yogic practice,"I have good and bad news, good news are that you can completely heal your npd, bad news are that it requires dedication, yogic practices to seriously purify yourself.

Yogic knowledge has it all, I healed myself with it. Npd is nothing else but misidentifying the self with surroundings due to some events that has made that as a dominating habit, trauma etc.

Identifying the self with surroundings, with other people, makes those surroundings be a part of yourself, as you spread your awareness anywhere else but your own body, you lose yourself and you take on all the hurt and bad energy of the world. Then you try to survive by identifying the self with some good energy sources, this would be called supply.

On an energetic level, you will then exist only inside your head, our natural state would be a completely relaxed state, having awareness spread evenly on the whole body. You could try spreading your awareness gently on your body, that would wake up all the buried stuff within you that needs to be released.

What you need to do is to bring back the sensitivity of your nervous system, this you help by cutting off coffee, meat, stopping overindulging in sexual activities.

The real stuff that will heal you is pranayama. What pranayama does is that it oxygenates your whole body as you retain your breath. This heals your nervous system from trauma and all stuff buried within, releases karmic attachments to other people. (On shrooms I saw how through lungs you literally charge your body with love, its all in the breath). On a practical level I would describe it as now when you do pranayam, space will free up in your body for your own love energy, which is you. You get your own body back for yourself. Then the true self is there. (Nadi purifying pranayam, 3x1 hour a day, at least an hour a day)

Other important mentions would be that you should learn to keep to yourself, protect your inner self, not take in outside energies, to simply mind your own stuff, being friendly with no expectation in return. People in general have all their own traumas and stuff, it isnt like they all know a secret and then there are people with npd, no everybody has their own challenges.

It has been quite a journey, I'm offering this knowledge because I have made it through and it is possible for everyone. Narcissist karma is one of the hardest things to transcend but it is possible. I would say that if one had the right knowledge and mindset (a lot of practice and a pure mind), it would be possible to heal from any kind of psychopathy in six months. Without these kind of serious purifying practices, I don't see a way out of the labyrinth of npd, any other stuff would be too slow. With this stuff, as your body heals rapidly, your mind is forced to follow as they are both interconnected.

Edit: the false self would be like a large tamasic samskara in the subtle body, it will get burned off by these purifying practices, then you will get glimpses of the true self and you can start to practice living as the true self.",1,1732920967.0,NPD,2,0.67,False

While they are a chain, there are slight differences in the amenities on offer, especially in terms of amenities, service and hotel breakfast. If you're looking at staying at one of these hotels on your upcoming trip and can't decide, I hope this helps!

Edit: A note to help out my tattooed pals, Tattoos are OK! Noticed a couple of guests didnt cover their small tattoos either. They will give out a maximum of three tattoo stickers a day (medium or large sizes). They definitely wont cover a sleeve. There are signs saying tattoos forbidden but no one really cared but of course YMMV. Just a warning not to leave the tattoo sheet on for too long as it becomes hard to remove lol.

*Kyoto Shichijo (Stayed December 2023)*

This was the first one I stayed at and so was the benchmark for the other two. I believe this one was the newest of the three based off the newness of the rooms and amenities. 

Pros:

- Best breakfast by far, the dining room was large and there were many choices. The point of difference here was freshly made tempura. The sashimi on offer was also generous, with Ikura, salmon, scallops, tuna. Many desserts as well - packaged yogurt, matcha pudding and small cakes. 
- The hot drinks during the day on offer from the machine included matcha latte which is my personal favourite. The dining room also offered chocolate milk/cocoa.
- Massage chairs near the onsen baths, there was a rest area just outside of the baths with iced water and icecream (afternoons)/yakult (mornings)
- Onsen baths (for the women side) were the largest. Dressing room was biggest with space to get changed without being too cramped, the baths themselves were quite nice, lots of shower stalls, with a few baths inside, tiled resting area and upstairs area with a couple more baths. Multiple types of shampoo on offer to try.
- A very easy walk from Kyoto station and skinkansen, especially if you go along the karasuma underground passageway. 

Cons:

- There was housekeeping but any trash that was left outside of the bin was never taken. I.e. empty paper cups with nothing inside
- It was heavily crowded during my stay. Hotel is popular with English, Chinese and Korean tourists. Unfortunately there was a lot of hoarding of amenities (especially the massage chairs) and line pushing.
- Staff seemed overwhelmed all the time and while spoke english/Chinese/korean very well, seemed quite sick of us all. 
- There isn't much in terms of its immediate surroundings in terms of attractions. About 20 mins walk from Nishiki and Higashiyama areas
- Hotel was uncomfortably warm all the time. I understand it was mid December, but still. The AC everywhere except our room was like 26C.
- Hotel breakfast if not included in your room rate was the most expensive. 2600 yen 

*Osaka Namba (Stayed November 2024)*

This was the second one we stayed at and I went in expecting the same experience as the one in kyoto, however i was wrong. 

Pros:

- Proximity to Dotonbori and kuromon markets so great for eating out and shopping.
- The cheapest out of the three
- Staff were really nice and a lot more friendly and experienced with assisting guests.
- Easy walk from all the surrounding train stations but minimum 20mins train from the shinkansen. 

Cons:

- Was the smallest hotel out of the three
- No matcha latte machine in the reception area :( only hot coffee, no tea either.
- Breakfast was really small compared to Kyoto, with less choices on offer. Only salmon mixed with ikura, some tuna, shirasu (tiny whitebait) and okra. Their point of difference was the kushikatsu (deep fried skewers) which was yum but compared to the tempura was a little heavier and not something I want for breakfast, no pickles (strange given its proximity to kyoto), very little dessert. 
- Baths were very small with only one indoor hot bath and one outdoor and one sauna. Also only a handful of shower stalls and the changing area was tiny. I usually was not able to dry my hair there and had to go back to my room. 
- No rest area outside the baths and no massage chairs
- Incredibly crowded and every morning we would be stuck waiting for breakfast or the lifts. Other guests would often push into the lifts in front of us.
- Going out for dinner or to the shops was exhausting with all the crowds.

*Tokyo Asakusa (Stayed November 2024)*

This was the last one we stayed at and what I would consider the middle ground of the two.

Pros:

- Proximity to Sensoji, I was able to wander around the temple at midnight which was a wonderful and serene experience! was less than 5 minutes walk from the main temple building. 
- Proximity to conbini, shops, Donki, restaurants, everything you would want as a tourist! You could spend couple days just wandering around the surrounding areas and have a lovely time. (WARNING: Do not go to donki at midnight as this seems to be peak hour for the tax free line! I was stuck there for an hour!)
- Train station nearby (tsukuba express) straight to Akihabara for connection to JR lines or walk an extra few minutes to tawaramachi  or asakusa stations for the Ginza line. There is also the tobu line which is one stop to skytree.
- staff were friendly enough and housekeeping was also good.
- Baths were larger than Osaka and had the outdoor buro which was so nice after a day of walking. The indoor bath made me confident that these were natural onsen baths as the water was brown/black, which is a common colour for natural onsen waters in the Kanagawa/Tokyo area. I love this bath as it always makes my skin feel nice afterwards!
- The iceblocks on offer were elite! They had two flavours of garigari kun (ice blocks filled with shaved ice), as well as calpis iceblocks. The kyoto and osaka one had only calpis iceblocks and the other choices were the monaka and regular icecreams. 
- Less crowded than the other two hotels, I never had to wait for breakfast even during peak hour.

Cons:
- There is an identical looking hotel literally one minute walk away. I only figured it out because the lantern outside the other one said Dormy Inn, but the sign from far away was almost identical to the Onyado one.
- Still smaller than kyoto one.
- No matcha latte machines just coffee
- No massage chairs and no lounge area outside the baths.
- Breakfast was again, small with no fried foods on offer for breakfast at all and not a lot of choices on offer. There wasn't anything special at this one either. 
- Bit annoying getting there from Tokyo shinkansen station, have to transfer to the keihin tohoku/yamanote to akiba and then tsukuba express to asakusa. Not a great route if you have more than one piece of luggage on you as a lot of exits are stairs only.
- A little bit far from Shibuya, Shinjuku, Harajuku and Ikebukuro if you were wanting to go to those places often. 
- The bidet in our room shot cold water only which wasn't nice in the morning. 

Overall, I would definitely stay at the Kyoto and Tokyo branches again. Doubt I will stay in Osaka again (in general). I would recommend Kyoto as a base if you are looking to do day trips on the shinkansen around Kansai. Otherwise the other choice would be a hotel around Shin-osaka. The Tokyo one is a good base for exploring eastern tokyo but is a little exhausting if you are hoping to go to shibuya, shinjuku and harajuku areas daily. If I ever decide to stay in Osaka again (unlikely), would be around Umeda. 

Let me know if your experience was different or if you have any other questions and I hope this helps you plan your trip!",1,1732920854.0,JapanTravelTips,3,0.67,False
