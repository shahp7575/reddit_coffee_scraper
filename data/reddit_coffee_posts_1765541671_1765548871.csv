1pkstd9,https://www.reddit.com/r/knitting/comments/1pkstd9/feelings_of_guilt/,Feelings of guilt,"About 4 years ago, after knitting every single family member a toque for Xmas, I decided no more would I gift knit, at least not to that extent. Only immediate family and I would not pressure myself. My kids have actually come to enjoy the xmas/bday gifts where they get a partial knitted something for Xmas and the completed item the following bday.  I haven't even done that this year. I am working on a brioche scarf fir myself since I just learned the technique,  and a mindless blanket. 

I went shopping last night for some clothes for the husband and realized that since he has gained some not insignificant size, finding anything for him is pretty much non existent.  It made me think, this is a reason I knit. Not for him necessarily,  but just for the choice and variety. 

Now I am here, on the morning of December 12, wondering if he is the chosen one this year for the Xmas/bday gift.  However, my only option for yarn is michaels. The closest LYS is an hour and a half away and there is no way i could sneak away. I could order, but i have little hope the yarn would even arrive before xmas.  I have a significant stash, but no sweater quantities for his size.

He is knit worthy, if anyone wants to know.  Loves and wears to death all the toques (and slippers) I have made him. I have knit him one sweater years ago, that he wore a handful of times, but it was colour work, not something he gravitates to (my fault, i subconsciously knew he wouldn't), so I was thinking if I did, it would be a dark grey raglan. 

I think I should just have my coffee and talk myself out of it...",1,1765548605.0,knitting,1,1.0,False

Nowhere in time
Two souls meet up

Afraid of themselves

Outward they fell

Too lost in the moment
Too blind to see

Wont let them be

**\*\*\***

It was 0300, or 3:00 AM in local time, in East Atlanta, United States of America, and the area was lit up like the Fourth of July, but nobody was celebrating.

Blue and red lights flashed across the cracked, unkempt asphalt of Mayson Avenue and Foote Street, turning the impoverished neighborhood into a scene straight out of a war zone. Police cruisers lined the street, their doors open to create barriers and keep everyone out. This wasn't an ordinary drug bust; something entirely different was happening, leaving both the locals and the law enforcement absolutely bewildered.

Heavily armored FBI tactical vehicles sat ominously in the center of it all, oriented toward a smattering of run-down houses with barred windows and peeling paint. US Marshals in full gear moved between the vehicles, checking equipment and speaking into their radios as they maintained another layer of security just behind the Local and State law enforcement. Whatever the feds were hunting, it wasn't just another corner boy with a few ounces of crack.

""Keep 'em back!"" A Georgia State Patrol sergeant barked at his men, who were struggling to prevent the rowdy crowd of evicted residents from breaching their line. ""Arrest anyone who even thinks about trying to break through!""

The GSP and Atlanta Police officers looked uncomfortable as hell. They were deep in Henchmen Gang (5L) territory—a Nine trey Blood set that ran these blocks like their own personal kingdom. For now, the known gangsters felt content to just bitch and posture, but the Atlanta PD officers kept their hands near their service weapons as more and more people poured out of the surrounding buildings.

""Ay yo, what the fuck y'all doing?"" A young man in a black hoodie pushed toward the police line, his crew flanking him. Gold grills caught the strobe lights as he spoke. ""This our block! Y'all can't just run up in here like you own this shit!""

""Sir, step back,"" an Atlanta PD officer said, trying to keep his voice level. ""Everyone needs to remain outside the perimeter.""

""The fuck you mean?!"" Another voice from the crowd. ""Man, fuck that! My grandmama stay in that house! She ain't done nothin’ and y’all kicked her out just like that?!""

The crowd was getting thicker, angrier, and bolder. It was one thing to deal with one thug who had their pants sagging down to their knees and threw up signs, but when groups start to form, people get stupid and bold. Suddenly, someone gains a brief spurt of bravery, and their hands drift to their waistbands. A few had done so, but they hadn’t quite pulled out a weapon, though it sure as hell made every officer know they had something on them. The posturing was textbook: chins up, shoulders squared, and that aggressive lean forward that said they weren't backing down.

""On folks nem, y'all better not be in my shit!"" someone shouted from the back. ""I got papers for everything in that crib!""

Despite the massive police presence, the tension was starting to turn up a notch, and it was clear the gangsters really didn’t want law enforcement personnel snooping around the house they were hitting. The Feds had kicked the hornets’ nest and violated an unspoken rule the local PD usually followed—you didn't run around these blocks unless something serious was going down. A few arrests, sure. Serving a warrant on a trap house when absolutely necessary? Expected. But this? This was a major escalation.

""We're gonna need more units. Crowd's growing and getting hostile."" The GSP sergeant keyed his radio, voice tight.

It was an escalation that made The Henchmen Gang members even more anxious and twitchy than usual. The local and state police didn't fully understand the details—everything was kept secret, on a need-to-know basis—but these criminals knew exactly what was happening, who was targeted, and why.

The multitude of alphabet soup agencies had completely encircled the target house and forced everyone on the block to evacuate. Never in living memory had something like this happened in East Atlanta. Whatever the federal government wanted, they were more than willing to risk the inevitable lawsuits that were going to fly their way for violating people's rights.

Gangsters continued to posture outside the perimeter, trying to find a way to interfere. It was almost as if they were ordered to be here, but no one did anything too crazy after seeing the armored vehicles labeled FBI and the lurking US Marshals eyeing the crowds with rifles at low ready. It was clear no one was fucking around. Still, it would only take one idiot to make shit hit the fan.

However, the tightly wound tension was soon cut short by an absolute flurry of gunfire.

""SHOTS FIRED! SHOTS FIRED!"" Several officers pulled their weapons, spinning around looking for threats. But the federal agents seemed unperturbed.

The gunfire came from inside one of the cordoned-off houses, and it was a rip that sounded more at home in a warzone than a warrant service.

""All units stand down. Officers serving the warrant have made entry.” The dispatcher's voice crackled over the network. “We have been assured that the situation is under control.""

“Under control?” One of the APD officers nearly laughed as they all exchanged glances. “That sounded like the streets of Baghdad at the height of the Iraq War! How is that ‘under control’?” The man jeered as he turned back toward the now brooding and quiet mob.

But, as quickly as it started, the gunfire died down.

The gangsters outside whispered urgently to each other, probing the perimeter like they were desperate to get in. A few started pushing forward.

""Hey! Hey, stop!” An officer yelled, drawing his taser. “Fuck off or I’ll taze the shit out of you!""

""The fuck, you gon’ do bitch?!"" One thug shoved him hard.

A scuffle broke out as officers and gangsters started shoving and yelling, but a few Marshals rolled up with more teeth than bark. As the Marshals' rifle lights sent rapid blinking strobes, the brewing riot was prematurely stopped. The gangsters backed off as both groups managed to pull their people back before it escalated. The two sides separated into a tense standoff, hands hovering near weapons.

With their hands full, none of them noticed what was happening deeper in the neighborhood. An armored car backed up to the target house while US Marshals used their unmarked vehicles to block sight lines.

But one Georgia State Patrol officer slipped away from the standoff to grab his rifle from his cruiser, just in case. As Dug snatched his AR-15, he looked over his shoulder and caught something through a particular angle just over the bed of an unmarked US Marshal's F-150.

A behemoth that looked like a man, standing at least seven feet tall and built like an NFL linebacker on steroids. He was draped head to toe in heavy tactical gear, with ballistic plates covering his entire upper body. On his left arm, the giant carried a massive ballistic shield that had a rather particularly asinine sticker on it. A simple smiley face with ""SURPRISE!"" written above.

Dark humor aside, the most disturbing part was that the shield looked to be… riddled with so many bullet impacts that it had to be near failure. Not only that, but the officer could see strange colored impact marks on the shield along with a deep gouge on one side, which looked like someone had taken an axe to it.

But in the Hulk’s other hand was a 16-pound demolition sledgehammer, soaked in blood and bits of flesh.

The officer might have panicked if not for the massive FBI patch on the giant's custom oversized plate carrier. However, another oddity that was equally jarring followed right behind the giant as they walked by. Striding more confidently was a woman with pointed, elongated ears that looked more at home at Comicon than a SWAT raid.

Moreover, this woman was pushing a handcuffed suspect along in a rather painful way, with her left arm threaded under his, lifting his cuffed arms at an angle that forced him to walk on his tiptoes while her hand was grabbing a fistful of his hair. The poor guy’s head was yanked so far back that he could barely see where he was going. Each step forward required him to arch his back awkwardly, a position meant to maintain full control while inflicting maximum discomfort without causing permanent damage—a textbook pain compliance technique that was usually heavily frowned upon in law enforcement if not outright police brutality.

It was a sight that caused a cognitive disconnect for the officer. He saw the familiar shape of a wannabe model who could have been plucked directly from an Instagram feed—the high, long, dark blue ponytail, the runner leggings that hugged her figure, the tight long-sleeve top that stopped at her forearms.

Nothing seemed to fit. The contrast between modern feminine athletic clothing and high-speed operator gear was too jarring to process. Hell, this woman’s chest rig was even arranged like that of an assaulter and held only a plate and a few magazines. Her short-barreled AR-15, hanging from her chest, felt more suited for shady work than law enforcement.

Blinking hard and repeatedly, the GSP officer wondered if stress was making him see things. Pointed ears? On an FBI agent? Everything about this woman made the massive three-letter patch ‘FBI’ on her chest and back seem hilariously absurd. He would rather eat rocks than believe she belonged to such a formal agency that was such a stickler for rules and decorum.

The man’s gaze lingered a moment longer before something clicked behind his eyes—why in the hell was he looking at something that was clearly none of his business? The Georgia State Patrol officer wore the look of a man who knew better than to even think about whatever worries he might have about what he saw.

More importantly, he knew better than to keep gawking no matter what was happening. He liked his job, and losing it by being even slightly aware of what the FBI was up to would not be the best outcome. So it didn’t take much to convince the officer to turn his attention back to his cruiser and focus on checking his rifle's optics.

At the same time, Lysandra’s eyes kept drifting toward that same officer, wondering if she would need to have a word with someone, until she noticed the deliberate disengagement. She smirked beneath her neck gaiter. Smart man. It seemed even in this world, people could be a little nosy, but she had to give credit to the law enforcement of this world. They were professional and knew when to mind their own damn business.

Her teammate—a seven-foot orc that was present during the CIA’s more kinetic lessons that she just called Grump—hummed ‘Don’t Stop Me Now’ as he could before tossing his now-useless ballistic shield into the back of the open armored car. It seemed the quasi-monster threw it a bit too hard, as a horrendous metallic crash resounded and caused several agents to flinch.

""Ahhh…! Infinite hells, you're pulling too hard!"" The prisoner suddenly whined with heavily accented English while he tried to twist away from her grip.

""Tace, stultus,"" Lysandra immediately hissed for him to shut up in her native tongue before pushing upward on his arm harder eliciting another scream of pain as the detainee’s shoulder started to slip in its socket.

Lysandra couldn’t help but glare at this idiot with her one good eye and snarl. She knew this worthless piece of shit had advice on how to brew up some truly nasty stuff in this god-awful mess of a house. While Lysandra didn’t know much about human vices, she understood they had them.

She, however, knew about the illegal alchemical concoctions from her world. While some were considered euphoriants or more recreational, most of the substances Lysandra was used to had a purely utilitarian purpose. This could range from physical performance enhancers, mental stimulants, arcane amplifiers, or even elemental affinity attunements.

There was a variety of applications for alchemy, although they came with some… very nasty effects and side effects if not made by professionals with actual quality control.

Back in her world, elixirs and flasks were as common as coffee. Flasks of stamina allowed one to bypass the body's natural thresholds and sustain physical effort much longer. Some vapor inhalers sharpened the mind to a razor's edge, allowing someone to hold complex spell matrices for hours, or even helping the mundane maintain focus for just as long. There were eye drops that temporarily granted enhanced vision at night. Even simple energy draughts kept soldiers marching longer or served as quick morning pick-me-ups when diluted.

When properly crafted by guild-certified alchemists, the substances were relatively harmless. Sure, you'd experience an uncomfortable come-down—muscles aching like you'd been hit with hammers, mental fog as thick as soup, and grogginess that made you want to crawl into bed for a week. But nothing permanent. Nothing that couldn't be slept off or fixed with another proven alchemical concoction.

The dependency, though... that’s where things got really nasty. Warriors who couldn't face battle without a fearless elixir. Scholars who needed clarity flasks just to think straight. The body was quick to adapt, and when substances were abused, it often led to one forgetting how to function without that chemical crutch.

But the unauthorized stuff made by any no-name fool with an alchemical book? The stuff this piece of garbage had been brewing? It was beyond horrifying in many ways.

One of Lysandra’s original tasks as a newly appointed knight was to patrol the streets, hunt down the rogues, and deal with the victims. It was one thing to be dependent on guild proven concoctions, pills or remedies, but whe none got addicted to the illicit stuff… Things got nasty.

On the lighter side, someone might become so overwhelmingly addicted that their mind gradually starts to decay and their impulse control diminishes. In more… extreme cases, deformities began to appear in lower-quality or even experimental batches. Bones started to warp, the skin sloughed off in patches, and organs suddenly began to decay as one slowly turned into something worse than the Undead.

At least the Undead stopped rotting…

But what really haunted Lysandra were the mental effects. People caught in waking nightmares that lasted for weeks. Individuals who forgot how to speak, recognize faces, or tell the difference between reality and the screaming void in their minds. She watched a kid—no older than sixteen—claw his own eyes out because he couldn't stop seeing his dead mother crawling out of the walls. Another was found eating glass, convinced it was candy, his mind so scrambled so badly, that he couldn't feel his mouth tearing apart.

The worst part? The stuff was easy to make but hard to do right. It didn’t take many hits of the tainted stuff for the brain to start rewiring itself. You’ll need more and more of it just to maintain the illusion of normalcy. Without it, users experienced withdrawal that made some of these earthly substances seem like a mild headache, except for a few particularly nasty ones.

If Lysandra had something to compare it to, it would be the more extreme opioids or tranquilizers. These caused inevitable and complete psychotic breaks. Withdrawals usually involve violent seizures and a burning desire that drives them to do just about anything to get another fix.

And this asshole, whether he was skilled or not, had been helping the people of Earth try to mass-produce some of it for distribution.

Another howl of pain escaped the detainee’s mouth as Lysandra yanked him up again just for good measure. While it made the elf feel a little better, a few FBI agents seemed to disagree as they shifted the display, as it edged uncomfortably close to excessive force protocols they had to follow.

Never mind the blatant violations of Constitutional rights this… ‘team’ had committed, but there wasn't much the Law Enforcement agencies could do since Lysandra had her people were... loaners from a rather notorious agency. There was going to be hell to pay in the form of litigation in the near future, but the FBI knew any complaints would fall on deaf ears.

This entire operation had become the mandate of the American people, given the expanded powers Congress had quietly granted Law Enforcement agencies after the Ohio Incident.

The shadiness of this specialized loaner team became even clearer as more operator-looking individuals filtered in behind Lysandra. Each of them wore a neck gaiter to hide their features and carried themselves more like elite butchers than SWAT officers.

It was obvious these individuals were either poached from ‘The Company’s’ highly regarded paramilitary units. They looked, walked, and quacked like poached Tier One or Two operators who swapped their roles in covert foreign operations for fake FBI credentials to operate within the continental United States.

While making up the vast majority of this new task force, they weren’t alone. More netizens from that anomalous area, dressed in the same tactical gear, joked and laughed with the operators as they headed toward the armored vehicles. Each of them looked like just another high-speed Law Enforcement Agency tactical team member, save for their strange features and the fact that they all wore the same goofy patch as Lysandra.

On the woman's chest, just below the three-letter FBI patch, was a smaller patch with the words ""DON'T PANIC"" written in big, bold yellow letters. It was a play on the acronym of the unit they actually belonged to: PANIC, the Pan-Anomalous Neutralization and Isolation Command. Only those in the know understood what it meant and how serious they were. To everyone else, it was just a humorous morale patch.

""We'll do our best to sweep the rest of the house for intel,"" an FBI agent sighed as he approached Lysandra from the side of the truck, giving other agents an uncomfortable look. ""But you left a... mess in there. I get you're not LEO, but… ya gotta at least try to take people alive at the bare minimum.""

Lysandra shrugged. ""What do you mean? We have someone alive."" She flashed him a cheeky smile as she pushed the detainee toward their Bearcat armored truck and loosened her grip on the poor man’s hair.

But as she did that, Lysandra’s ear caught the faintest noise. Her gaze immediately shot down to see the prisoner's lips subtly moving in a quiet chant. Without hesitation, Lysandra reacted instantly by using her arcane abilities to boost her strength, gripping the man's hair tighter and thrusting her arm forward. His head slammed against the Bearcat's armored door with a horrible thunk, causing him to momentarily go limp. Then he squirmed sluggishly, moaning.

""Whoa, whoa! What the hell?! We don't do that here!"" Several agents started forward in alarm, but Lysandra raised a hand to stop them.

“Relax,” Lysandra harrumphed. ""You don't know what my people are capable of or what they can do. Just a few words from this one, and things could have turned very ugly, very fast."" She said, glaring at the FBI agent giving her a dirty look, not quite believing what she's saying. “And trust me, you probably don't want him getting off whatever spell he was trying.”

The agents watched blood pour from the detainee's head and pool on the cracked asphalt. At first, they all thought she just straight-up brained the man, but after a few agonizing moments, a horrible, pained groan escaped the detainee’s mouth. He wasn't quite dead, but he definitely had a severe concussion.

Although no one really wanted to admit it, Lysandra wasn't wrong. There had been other incidents where officers and agents were horribly killed or maimed because they treated these otherworlders like regular people. One agent in Chicago had half of his body completely burned to the point of fifth-degree burns.

It surprised everyone that fifth-degree burns even occurred, and when someone looked into it, they found that’s when bones started to melt.

It was obvious that everyone was now operating in murky waters. Their standard procedures had to be completely overhauled and created on the fly due to the very unique circumstances they found themselves in, and old habits died hard. When your entire career as a federal agent is under a microscope by any dickhead with a lawyer wanting to sue or cause a fuss, you tend to act accordingly. But now that the microscope seemingly got tossed in the trash can…Law Enforcement personnel everywhere found themselves in a rather jarring situation, to say the least.

""Come on, let's hurry this up,"" Lysandra said, grabbing the severely concussed and bleeding detainee by his collar. With one smooth motion that belied her frame, she tossed him into the back of the Bearcat like a sack of potatoes, causing the poor soul to hit the metal floor with a wet thud.

As more pained groans echoed out, Lysandra reached up and pulled the advanced in-ear hearing protection from her long, pointed ears—custom-made Peltor TEP-300’s that had been modified to fit her non-human anatomy. ""Think we actually got a viable lead on Matthias not that far from here.""

1pksqyp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pksqyp,Simply Good Coffee Plastic Free Review,"Hey guys!
This is a quick first impressions on my new brewer.  About 6 months ago I pre-ordered this coffee maker that doesnt have plastic directly touching the water or the coffee. This is achieved by using metals and glass instead. Currently, my daily driver is a Hario switch and I grind with a niche zero.  

Out the box its nicely built and had a few freebies!  It included good instructions for use and care as well as a metal coffee scooper and 30 #4 filters. (Similar ones are sold at Kroger unlike the cone filters I use for my switch!)

Using the coffee maker is rather simple.  There's 2 toggle switches on the front with an ""on"" light.  You'll pour the amount of water you intend to use in the glass reservoir (the 2 line is about 300 grams of water, the 4 line is about 600 grams of water.).    Add and wet a filter in the basket, then add however much coffee you'd like!  The preinfusion switch in the on position will automatically give a spritz of hot water before continuing with the brewing process.  Toggle the spring loaded on switch then let it ride!  There's also a stopper on the brew basket if you'd like the control for a full immersion.  A couple of minutes later you'll have some solid coffee! The heat plate also did a nice job of not burning my coffee while sitting for about an hour.

All in all, I like it!  Let me know if youve got any questions but I am no way associated with this brand, I just wanted a plastic free brewer for guests to be able to easily use.",2,1765548425.0,coffeestations,1,1.0,False

*Sexy tree lady*

“Trevor. Bill. Come to hear me play, get some coffee, or experience frustration today?”

Trevor laughs. “A little of all three, if I am honest. You do play well.” He winks and starts to head inside. Bill hangs back. His hands are behind his back. Oh great.

“Miss Connie. I was told to thank you for being lenient. I was stupid. Here.” He moves his hands and gives me a rose from a florist.

I tilt my head. “You are apologizing for assaulting my tree by handing me the corpse of a flower someone cut up to sell?”

The look on his face is a perfect change from worry to realization to shock to horror and then to sorrow. I love it. I can see why the Arches have been playing pranks on humans for centuries. They are so fun! I should end this before he has severe trauma though.

“I love it. Thanks.”

He stops and now the emotions on his face is all over the place. Okay maybe I didn’t actually stop the prank…

“You are forgiven, just try not to piss off the people I love and we are good, okay sweetie?” I give him a kiss on the cheek and head into the CaFae. He follows like a puppy.

Ugh. I hope someone spayed him.

Then I remember the roots. Oh, I might have…. Heheh.

*Enlightened human*

One of the bikers from yesterday walks in. The nice one. Trevor.

He smiles at me as he gets to the counter. “Hey, little lady, can I have a Café Mocha, Venti?” He absent mindedly starts petting Carrot who has hopped up on the counter and is purring now. I nod and start getting things ready for him. I hear him chuckle. “Hey, you look like a friend of mine. Name’s James.”

I nod at him. “Maybe. My brother is named James.”

“James Patterson? Bronx on Knox Place by World View?”

“Yep, that’s my bro James.”

He looks confused. “James never told me he had a sister. Just two brothers one of whom…” He has figured it out. Oh no. Here it comes.

“Huh. Gonna have to yell at him if he tells me he has two brothers. He obviously has a sister and a brother.” He smiles at me.

“I would have comped that drink if you had said that before you paid.” I am not crying. It is close.

“Maybe. But then you would wonder if I was buttering you up. Nah. This is fine. Just like them legs. Thank you sweet thing.” He walks over to where Connie is talking with a guy that looks completely smitten with her. They start talking.

Henry walks over. “You okay? He hurt you? You are crying.”

Dude. You are not my big brother even if I wish you were. “Henry, you are the best. And no, he did the opposite. I think I might just be in love.”

He laughs. “That’s a werewolf. Be careful, he bites.”

I sigh. “I like biting.”

*Tuatha De Danaan*

I watch a gremlin leave my room as we come in after a morning of watching the werewolves. Sooner or later one of them will leave by themselves. We can interrogate them at that point.

I open my door and take a quick inventory of the items within it. Oh. My packet. I look out the window and see the creature starting to leave the building in the snow. I jump out the window, spring off one of the ladders and drop down to the ground. It screams and runs.

We head down an alley and the little monster turns a corner too fast, it slides on the slush and lands face first in a puddle. My packet was being held against its chest. I see the entire thing land in the puddle.

I sigh and pick up the gremlin by an ear. “Visit me ever again, and you will wish I had killed you.”

It cowers and I drop it.

Time to talk to Nixie.

*Human if you squint hard enough*

Well, this is a bust. I can’t find “The other fam” as Jackie has dubbed Matt, Mary and Riley, a good place to live. They come back in a few weeks to start living in the city. Maybe talk to Skeritt? No, I can’t suggest that, it is completely a selfish suggestion.

“Skeritt, I need to know some information. Can you tell me who would know about my powers? I have been ignoring this part of me for too long and I need to embrace it better. To do that, I gotta know what I can do.”

He chuckles and looks up from his paper. “Queens Mab or Morgana are your best bets. Titania is a close second to them along with the Dread Archmage Tiffany. Tiffany is not in the country at the moment. Mab is at the human dignitary lodging of the court. She is entertaining an old friend.”

I slip him a small favor coin. I got them from Nixie. He winks and pockets it.

I go back to the office and cross over. I then head to court. After a brief stop for directions from a court page, nice goblin I hope he gets a name soon, I head to the building. I knock and am told I can come in.

I hear Mab laughing as I walk in.

An older gentleman, probably in his upper 50s is talking with her. He stands up as he sees me.

“Good day, Evergreen Queen, it is a pleasure to finally meet you.”

I tilt my head. “Finally? Pistachio Latte, venti, about once every 3 months.”

He stares at me. Oh. Whoops.

With a great deal of effort I clamp down on my power here and drop back to regular Pat. The poor man gawks. “Wait… Pat is the Evergreen Queen I have been hearing about? I didn’t realize they were the same person.”

I let him catch up while I look at Mab. “This was sort of what I wanted to talk to you about.”

She is giving her friend the side eye. Her smile is so warm and happy I am amazed.

“Dear, you have met Pat. She owns the CaFae.”

I glare at her. “Co-owns. As do you and Queen Titania. Owned by all three courts. I just run the coffee shop.”

Mab laughs as she walks up and hugs me. “Darling, Jason has told me he is having problems with the business on the other fronts because you keep outperforming his expectations and so he has to redo his projections. Letting Jackie handle the projections has helped as she somehow keeps up with you. The entire thing is yours, really. We are silent partners and even your CFO knows better than to interrupt you when you are crushing it.”

I roll my eyes.

“Back on task. This.” I allow the form that feels comfortable here to take control again. I am my Queen self again. “I don’t know what all I can do or what my powers are, really. I seem to have ones that shock the rest of you…”

She laughs.

“I would trade the information I know, information I can glean, and information I can request for a favor. Not a major one.”

Well, there it is. Gotta do favors. Hate doing them for myself but I have gotten pretty good at it.

“Agreed as long as they do not break any of my personal beliefs or cause harm to someone.”

She nods. “Bargained and done.” I repeat her words. “Bargained and done.” The air shifts. We have a contract.

She smiles at me.

“You are a first. A Warlock that entered into a contract not for your own personal gain but to assist your patron. A warlock with selfless motives. As such you gained a fair amount of power. You also technically entered into this pact relationship with hundreds of Fae, including every member of both the Summer and Winter Court and technically every member of the Evergreen Court.”

The gentleman gasps. “Holy fuck.”

“I know this, my friend.” I get that. It is what I can do that scares me.

“The rarest gift a warlock may have, until you, is WitchFyre. And you also have it.”

“No fucking way.” Frank seems to be concerned.

“Summon your flames, Patricia of the Evergreen.”

I feel my eyes light up. The green flames erupt around me. Some condenses in my hand. I play with it. Both of them watch. The gentleman is staring in awe.

“WitchFyre is strange. It can be made to burn, freeze, torture, heal, create, or erase. It is the power of chaos and creation. And you have wielded it like a surgeon wields a scalpel since you first manifested it. Your very nature is caution and mercy. Remember the assassins you engulfed in flames that believed they were burning to death but were unharmed aside from the memory of their torture?”

I feel a bit of shame here. Though that was when Devil Pat had more sway than she does now. *Also they fucking deserved it.* Shush you.

I nod.

She smiles. I think she heard Devil Pat.

“You froze and burned them while healing them. The result was excruciating without real harm. If you focus and put your intent into it, the fire will obey your will. Toss that ball onto the ground and have it form a being like Jackie.”

I think about how to do it and it just happens. It jumps off my hand and begins to grow larger and definite shape. It begins to turn into a shapely looking fire.

“Is that the redhead barista that worked at your coffee shop?”

I do my Spock eyebrow thing.

“Come on, she’s basically a walking bombshell that could get this 120year old heart going…”

“You look under 60…”

“Thanks. Does an old heart well. Oh, did I mention I am technically a Necromancer?”

“You like giving people hickies?”

His laugh is so full of joy. I love the old guy already.

Mab shakes her head. “Leave it to you to have the same sense of humor as someone over 4 times your age.”

“Who you insulting here? I know it wasn’t me…”

She slaps my shoulder. “Focus Patricia. Now then. You can see what it can do here. You will have to practice the real tricks. Especially the deletion. You can erase things from existing. They will vanish. Be very cautious with that. Don’t erase the concept of exchanging ideas between people called intercourse. And a congress between people meaning sex and then switch them when you bring them back…”

I blink a few times here. That was a VERY specific example.

Nah.

“Now then. This power is the most dangerous and most pressing. I will get more information and a tutor. As for the other powers. You have flight, and the wings are designed for quick and agile movement. It suits your needs.”

She inspects my wings. They shimmer.

“Dragonflies are predators. They are one of the most agile things in the sky. You chose well.”

“Your skin…”

I nod. “Yea, it is chrome, though it has some small cracks.”

She shakes her head. “No, darling. This is a material we call Wolfram. It has the atomic symbol of W.”

“Wait… that’s Tungsten…. FUCK ME, I am literally as dense as Tungsten?!?!”

She chuckles. “The first time I saw your form I knew why. You needed to defend yourself from the world. Even now this material serves as a barrier, protecting you.”

“Great.”

“An alarming thing I have heard about is your domain. Within it you appear to have powers less akin to an ArchFae and closer to a god. Take that tendency to simply be where you wish to within your domain when someone steps out of line. It is apparently utterly terrifying. Things do not simply exist in a new place an instant after being in another after. I have heard several people say it happened between instants, another said between heartbeats. And you were not moving, you simply existed in the new location. Even Pixies are not so good at vanishing and appearing elsewhere, and they mostly manage it through the FaeWyld and a trick of distance there.”

“You also can hear things within your domain as if next to them when you wish to. This is fairly common. Being able to whisper to those you wish to is not. I remember being a little surprised when you first performed it in front of me. My sisters were terrified when we met Laoch and you did it.” She pauses.

“Then there’s the fact that your domain has been helping keep our secret and protecting people as it does so. Have you ordered people to do things within your domain when they are being contrary and they simply do it?”

I nod. “Yuri sitting and shutting up, Jackie behaving, things like that. Is that why Mona doesn’t talk back?”

She laughs. “No. I suspect it is simply because she respects your authority over her so much. You dominated a dominatrix. Unless you happened to know that one’s true name and invoked it, she would be able to ignore such commands even within your domain.”

Oh. Well shit. Holy fuck. She gave me that too. Wait.

“I called her a bad guest. She started fading away as if the color in her skin was simply vanishing. I also kinda beat her head into a wall and caved the wall in.”

“Oh, is that what caused that hole in the ladies room those months ago? Fun. Let me guess, she was coming onto Jackie before you finally realized you were in love with the fire imp?”

“More like molesting at the time. And yes.” Some shame here.

“Remarkable self restraint. If it was me and I felt even half as strongly about Ms. Flynn as you do, Mona or Titania would not have survived. I meant what I said would happen to Amai.”

I shift a little. That is the first time she has called him by his nickname. Considering she couldn’t be in a room with him without him nearly peeing his pants from her glares two months ago, progress. I also cover my arm without thinking about it.

She sees me covering my arm.

“Let us get back to that other power you mentioned. I witnessed it hurting Titania as well.”

I nod. “I still feel like shit about that. I was killing her with my jealousy.”

“So your domain is effectively as potent as a demiplane.”

My confusion must show on my face.

“A plane of existence is what we are in. The first world is one. The second world is one. Heaven and hell are ones. A demiplane is like a smaller one that exists within or near a plane. They have their own rules. Your domain is so powerful it has effectively become one. The rule of hospitality is literally enforced as effectively as gravity is within your world. You declare someone a bad guest and it is as if the very air they breath has rejected them. As if reality is attempting to delete them. They have a choice of leaving or dying.”

Yep. I am shook. Holy crap, I do that?

“So, if any were to go into your shop and attempt to perform an action you have determined is not allowed, the domain would enforce the punishment for doing so. If it even allows the action.” She seems to think about some things.

“I wonder it the One Above All could reject your rules or if even they are forced to abide by them due to the agreement to the pact.

Her friend jumps in, “Oh, if he signed, he’s fucked. I saw the wards, barriers, and pacts on that building. I don’t think even God himself could survive pissing off Pat in that place if he actually broke a rule. Now if he didn’t, you can’t hurt him at all.”

“Wonderful. Could we stop theorizing about whether or not I can kill Bo…God? I am not Nietzsche.”

They both laugh. The gentleman winks at me and mouths “Good one.”

Mab looks at me.

“You know.” She isn’t questioning me.

“Yuri sprung on me that a regular to my shop that has been going for years is God, yes. You knew as well.” Suddenly a lot of the pieces are not just falling into place, they are showing a picture.

“I did. He told me to keep quiet. You understand why I did not share.”

“Yea well, from now on I am saying Bob Dammit…” I smile and I swear I hear her snicker.

“Back on task, you can hear things at a distance and whisper within the domain to anyone within it. The last is unusual.”

I raise my hand. “I can hear things within my line of sight if I want to, actually. I can and have whispered to Connie within this court before I assumed the mantle of Evergreen Queen and have done so in other places.”

“Wonderful…” The mage is trying to wrap his head around this. Great.

She smiles. “So we have your domain, flight, clairvoyance, our limited telepathy, WitchFyre, and lightning. You are also stronger than most Sidhe. You tore cold iron manacles off of Amai in front of us. Anything else?”

“Can you command people to heal within your domain?”

Mab looks at me. “What?”

“During the assassination attempt the guys shot John Bogbootah. He was dying. I told him to be a good boy and heal so he can be a good security guard. Just 2 nights ago Todd was dying from a werewolf attack. I told him to heal. Both were on Skerrit’s land. We share his domain.”

“Healing is something we can do directly, though only Summer Court Royalty is skilled at it. I can, but it will leave scarring. I can keep things alive. Makes it better to keep torturing them. Morgana can heal as well, though it is difficult for her. Titania can heal someone as well as what you described. She has to concentrate. So your ability is most likely more potent.”

“Additionally, Titania and Oberon have never held domain outside their apartment. You have in the lobby and where else?”

“The sidewalk between the fence and the door.”

“We may need to experiment on this one. I wonder if many of your abilities can work outside your domain and they aren’t based on the location.”

Hmmm.

“Does this count as my domain?”

""No.""

I am next to her the moment she stops talking and I kiss her cheek. A moment later I am sitting next to Frank. I wink at him.

He goes pale. “That answers that.”

She looks at me. “Never show Titania or Morgana that you can do that outside your domain. They may be as terrified as I am. Either would attempt to end you before you were a challenge to them.”

“I am sorry.”

She laughs. “Do not be. There are things we can do that you likely never imagined. And we are ancient. We can bestow blessings in ways you cannot. But considering your consort, the fear may hit a new level.”

My fear response kicks in. “What about my consort?”

Mab looks at me. “Ask for a favor from Morgana to know more.”

“Why?” I am curious.

“There is a prophecy. She knows the most about it. I can say no more.”

I nod.

“One thing you can do that I cannot, the blessings. Think I can manage it?”

Mab nods at me. “You must picture what you wish to happen. It must have a clear goal. Then speak words that mean what you picture as you say them. A blessing comes from the core. Finally, you must bestow a kiss on them. The more intimate that kiss, the more powerful it is.”

“Like tell my biological child that could see through glamour to imagine she will only do so when she wishes to and kiss her on the forehead?”

“That example was far too specific…”

“Yes it was, so I can do this. I have such an important one to give soon. Wow, Mab, I got a bargain on this favor, didn’t I?”

She chuckles. “Rule 3 is dating, correct?”

“Yea...”

“Not calling in favors…”

“Mab, you are truly amazing. I’ll wait for you to call in that favor for real. I look forward to it. I need to go and check on Mona and then see about a date with Connie.”

“Finally decided to take her offers to become your lover?”

I wink at her.

“Frank, you are awesome. Keep being her friend. She deserves a lot more than she has. Guess she has to make up for it in quality.”

He nods and shakes my hand. “I heard you saved Todd the fox of Yorkshire. I am very glad.”

“Todd? Huh?”

“The…” Mab is shaking her head.

“Maybe go talk with him?”

I nod. Another stop today… wait, he has a shift. Sweet.



# Jan 06, 2025: Todd Anderson

*King of the Trolls*

The office door opens as I clock in and Pat walks out. She gestures for me to go to the office. I follow.

“Todd the Fox of Yorkshire?”

Well fuck. I nod.

“Do explain, little bro.” She is smiling and damn if I don’t want to have some fun because she isn’t going to do anything short of enjoy me squirming here.

“Once upon a time there was a troll that was so crafty, so cunning, do deadly that no knight could ever find him, or if they did, they did not live long after doing so. The troll was said to be a fox for its cunning. This is ye olden times, and the old English word for fox is Todde, spelled with two dees and an e at the end.”

She nods. “So you remember your past all the way back to there now?”

I nod, “Yes. Met an old friend and in hearing the name and seeing myself on an old security video on VHS I started to remember.”

“So, you are like hundreds of years old or even closer to thousands?”

“Yep.” Why does this feel like a trap…

She smiles at me as if she just won. “Pedo.”

“OH GOD DAMMIT NEE-CHAN!”

She starts laughing so hard she rolls off her chair. At some point I start laughing with her. She eventually recovers. “Come on, Todd, why do you have a crown?”

“Oh, they use to call me king of the trolls… oh shit.” I see the look of triumph on her face.

She grins and her words sound, different, full of power. “Congratulations, Todd, Fox of Yorkshire, King of the Trolls and a king of the Evergreen Court!”

I feel the magic hit me like a Mack truck.

I go to mirror and look. I am bigger, more dangerous looking and now a crown of bone and iron nails floats above my head.

“Thanks…”My voice says the opposite. She laughs.

She looks at me and looks annoyed about it too. “Look, Morgana told me if I didn’t find a suitable king soon I was going to have to ride some Sidhe cock until one spontaneously became one…”

Yea, sounds like Morgana. “Look, Patricia, one of the duties of the king is to serve the Queen.”

“You work for me. Good enough. You and I are both WAY too uncomfortable with any of the Sidhe sex shenanigans to have a traditional court relationship.”

Thank god.

“You have Beth and she has you. You two are amazing together and I won’t ever interfere with that.”

“Awwww, thanks.”

“And I’m too young for you...”

“There it is…”

Her grin is just so adorable, I wanna smack her. I guess the student has become a master. So proud of her.

We hug hard.

“Love you Nee-Chan.” I really do love this woman. She is an amazing friend. No. Not a friend, she is my adopted sister.



# Jan 06, 2025: Patricia Rae Wallace

*Human, mostly.*

I find Morgana in my lobby. Hmmmm.

“Good day fellow Queen of the Evergreen!” I smile and she rolls her eyes. She can’t hide her little smile.

“Mab said I should be here. I listen to my sisters. So why have you sought me out?”

I wink and sit down. “I have an announcement and a favor to request.” She looks at me with a quizzical look.

“Oh do proceed. I felt the court change. I want to know who… why does the troll have a crown of bones and IRON?”

I gesture dramatically. “Meet the King of Trolls, The Fox of Yorkshire, Todd. New King of the Evergreen.”

Todd walks up and waves sheepishly.

Morgana eyes him and then smiles. “He is actually quite imposing. Now we need a Seelie King. Well done, Patricia.”

I nod and smile. Awww, even now I love praise from authority figures.

“So what is the favor?”

“I would like you to explain to myself and my consort exactly what Jackie is.”

She drops her drink.

“Patricia, you do not want this favor. Once it is known, it cannot be unknown.”

I shrug. “My good friend, I am dealing with a lot of weirdness this week. This will just add to it.”

She sighs. “I can do this. As a favor.”

I nod.

“Well then, one of Nixies coins will suffice. I would have you bring the spitfire here so I can perform this favor.”

I nod and send Jackie a text. She heads over here.

“What’s up?” She doesn’t know what this is about.

“Jackie, come sit with us. You as well, Todd. You should know.” Morgana sighs and looks like she is mentally bracing herself.

“Now then, Jacqueline Flynn, you are an abomination, and a danger to the divine trinity of the Sidhe. The three queens.”

“Wut?” I think all three of us are staring at her like she just called Jackie and abomination. Oh wait, she did…

She shrugs as the other three of us all try to comprehend where that came from.

“Your father has an ancestor, Balor. He was one of the kings of the Fomorians. He fought against Lugh, whom he was related through as he was half Tuatha De Daanen. When we add your Sidhe blood we get ancestry that is told in a prophecy. It is ancient and not in a living language. It speaks of the destruction of the trinity. Let me use the best translation. ‘The one born of fire will break the Trinity. A Child born of blood Fomorian, Tuatha Dé Danann, and Sidhe will shatter the divine trinity of the Sidhe. A Queen stricken down by iron and fire, shall take her last breath before this child of destruction.”

I am processing this, poorly. Wait. So that’s why her power set is so different than anyone else’s?!

“The Fomorians were creatures of magic as much as any Sidhe. But they wielded them on a primordial level. They controlled the elements as easily as we control illusions. Your affinity, much like Balor’s is fire.”

Jackie finally says something. “So why has the prophecy never come true. There has to have been people with this lineage in the past.”

“There have been two other instances. The last was a knight and would be king by the name of Pendragon.”

Well fuck. Morgana features heavily in those myths. As the antagonist. Jackie picks up on it.

“You going to try and kill me?” She sounds sad. Like she’s okay with this?

Morgana shakes her head. “Never. Doing so would be the end of me. Your mate would be the one doing it for you. That is in the unlikely case that I could succeed.”

I mean, she isn’t wrong… No one is taking her from me again.

Jackie looks at me. “Awww, you just pictured a mass murder spree because of me!”

I shake my head at her, “You are horrible sometimes. And yes I did.”

Todd chuckles. “No offense Queen Morgana, but I doubt any of us would be able to succeed in killing her.”

Morgana says something that sends chills down our spines. “No, but someone wielding the spear might be able to.”

At that moment the chime rings and Bring me *Back to Life* plays. We all smile and then see Mona show up. “Oh, I need to talk with her, please excuse me for a few minutes.”



# Jan 06, 2025: Desdemona Giannopoulou

*Demon*

I am a mess. So many feelings show up as I walk through the doors. I am anxious, excited, and happy. And then the chime rings. “Bring Me Back To Life.”

Fucking what?

EVERYONE looks up, puzzled.

Grey smiles and waves. I wink at them. They are feminine today. More tips. I head to the back to put my things away and get ready to clock in.

Ms. Wallace is here, smiling. “Hey Mona, don’t freak out. Do you trust me?”

I nod. I do trust her.

“May you never be given more than you can handle within this place.” She kisses both my cheeks.

I feel lighter. Wait. A blessing? A Fae Blessing? She blessed me? She blessed me!

More importantly, she kissed me!

Just as I think I am going to break down I feel the crush of the emotion lessen. I do get some tears. But I… can handle it. “Gods below, Ms. Wallace, how did you give me the perfect gift?”

She shrugs. “I figured I have been skating. Need to step up when it comes to this. That was a blessing you deserved, anyway. Thank you for trusting me, Desdemona.”

I give her a kiss on her cheek. “Thank you for being you, Ms. Wallace.”

I get my gear on, punch in, and am about to step out when she stops me.

“Clock in before gear. There is a sign…”She points to it. I go to the floor laughing.

“Sorry I got distracted by you and Grey being so good to me.

“Oh yea, I completely forgot!!!” She gets on her phone and a few seconds later I see on our WhatsApp a new message from QueenBossBitch. “Mayday list has been updated. Grey has been added. Please don’t quit like Blake did, you are awesome.”

I chuckle. I hear a resounding “Aww yea, officially safe for work!” from Grey and I can’t help but laugh.

I see Ms. Wallace go and sit with Jackie, Todd, and Morgana. Hell of a power group.

Ms. Wallace sits down.

Jackie says something really weird, “Look, no matter what happens, there would only be a single thing that would ever make me want to hurt any of my fabulous fairy tale family. I very much doubt any of you would try and hurt Pat, so we are fine. And she is the same about me. Problem solved. The Fae queens are safe from the Jackie powered apocalypse.”

Ms. Wallace kisses her on the cheek. and heads for her office. “See, that isn’t an issue. We just have to look out for Jackie’s kids.” She winks and the rest of the table looks at Jackie in terror. Whatever is going on, it got scary, fast.

Morgana stares at Jackie and I notice something I have never seen in a Fae Queen before. Fear.

# Jan 06, 2025: Desdemona Giannopoulou

*Demon*

We’ve been working for a few hours and it is time for one of my breaks. I am making myself take them as told to by Ms. Wallace. “Hey Grey, wanna step out back and vape for a few while we have a chance?”

Grey smiles. “Yes and no. I will talk with you, but none for me.”

I nod and we go outside to the area we can vape. They are upwind of me. They smile and decide to ask the question they’ve been sitting on since I started work. “You’re doing better, I see. Going to be okay?”

The prankster is concerned for me. I feel the crush of the response of my emotions lessen. I will never be able to thank Ms. Wallace enough. “I am now seeing a therapist twice a week until I get a handle on things better. Ms. Wallace pushed it. Next meet is Saturday. She thinks I will be okay if I can work these feeling out in a healthy way.” I point to their belly. “When did you find out, by the way?”

Grey blinks at me. They look amazed after a second.

“How did you?”

“You are upwind of me. You’d normally be taking a hit before I would. Also, lust demons see visions of a person’s kinks. You and your now mate both have a breeding kink. So naughty. And both of you are completely in love with the other.” I wink at them.

They damn near fall over laughing. “Please tell me it is not first person vision.”

I shrug. “It is if it is a really strong desire. So, like, everyone in this place has done that to me…. And damn your imagination having me on top and being bred was… intense. Almost as intense as the one where you had me with male equipment breeding you…”

They gawk at me. “I swear it was only the one time.”

“Darling, you don’t have to make these visions. I see them. It is part of my nature. Sometimes the person gets them at the same time. Trust me, knowing my coworkers kinks isn’t something I really asked for. I also never fault any of you for them. Get to be 2800 years old and you’ve seen pretty much everything out there. It doesn’t bother you much. You have to remain a female mermaid until the little one is born?”

Grey nods. “The body rejects and absorbs them if it is early enough. Later and it can kill me and will kill the little one. Because of this we know as soon as we are pregnant. We can also control it to an extent. Just like we can lock ourselves to not switch.”

I realize something. “Pat?” My voice has so much sadness in it. I can hear it.

Grey looks as sad as I sound, and I am suddenly whelmed. The blessing stops it from becoming more than I can handle. Oh no, that sweet creature that can’t help themselves and is so desperate to bear a child cannot control their changes. Oh. Oh no.

Grey looks glum. “They found your counselor because they wanted to learn how to control it. Then they found out it is physical. Pat can’t stop the changes if the ratio is too drastic.”

Whelmed.

Grey looks at me. “I am one of the few merfolk who can see powerful magic being used. This place is doing a lot for you. And all because you care, Mona. I am proud of you and sorry for you. I hope these feelings can be something you not only handle but look forward to.”

I nod.

“Hey Grey, I am very happy for you. Hoping you have a healthy little merfolk kid. How’s John handling it?”

They laugh. “He is so looking forward to pounding me when I have a pregnant belly.” They wink and we both laugh.

“Can’t blame him.” I give Grey a kiss on the cheek.

“Hey, do incubi get pregnant?” Grey has a twinkle in their eye.

I laugh. “No, that stopped working well before I died. The tattoo is a mark of lust, it is what still remains of my soul. It also took the place of my reproductive organs. I have some of the pipes, just nothing works for that.”

Grey looks at me. “I don’t exactly knows how the whole demon thing works. You were mortal and died? Is this asking too much?”

I shake my head. “It’s fine. After you held me, I’d tell you anything short of my true name. I lived in a village. I was a slave sold as a pornai. It was…, not good. Near the end of my life I was the person that ran things from the shadows using sex, bribery, or blackmail. Laying there, dying from an STI the man purposely gave me, I was so angry I swore I would get revenge on those that wronged me. I died. I saw a dark entity that asked me if I was sure I wanted to go through with it. That was the first time I met Samael. I told him yes. He nodded and I felt a rush and then I got up. My body was dead. I had a new perfected version of my original body. I got my revenge. I left a wake of bodies and broken hearts behind me. I then made sure to seduce a mortal and give them my true name. Made sure they wrote it down and said I was as good as I am at sex. That way I had an out. Then I went to hell.” I shudder at that memory.

“Demons are basically vengeful ghosts that have form and the ability to make deals. They gain power. They do it through contracts. They do it through whatever that demon feeds off. I feed off of submission, off sexual gratification. That lover called me forth from hell because he couldn’t forget our one night.”

Grey chuckles. “You are fucking unforgettable. I mean that thing with your tongue…”

I laugh and wink at them. “As a demon I made deals and fucked over people for power through souls and contracts. I was a complete monster. By the reckoning of Samael, prior to my last contract I was the third most powerful demon in existence. I got a contract that let me stay on earth in the 900s CE because the contractor was stupid. I spent the entire time after that siphoning a tiny amount of sexual energy from partners. Sometimes that is basically taking a small amount of their soul. Like a sliver. Never enough to hurt them, usually only pain or shame and leaving them no different. It’s more efficient so I am guessing my ranking hasn’t decreased.”

They look at me. “That sounds fucking awful. Wait, you didn’t take any of my soul, I would have noticed.”

I chuckle. “I take it from clients, rivals, hate fucks. I don’t take it from friends. And I get most of my power from sex and subs anyway. The release of pleasure sustains me a lot. Just the raw emotion and pleasure, the rush, those are enough to feed and empower me. I don’t need to siphon souls at all now. Haven’t for hundreds of years.”

Grey looks at my belly, “That why the ink glowed?”

“Yes, it shows how powerful I am by how intricate it is and how much it glows. It also gets more vibrant as I get more powerful. It’s stayed pretty constant of late. I haven’t had any real reason to accumulate power and I am fine with that. Normal fun with people I enjoy being is enough to sustain the level I have it at. It has lost some of it’s oomph, but none of those abilities were things I liked doing anyway.”

“That why you became a Dominatrix?”

I nod. “It is, and then I came here and tried my abuse on Jackie. I was bad. Now I am here being good. Or trying.”

“You are. We love you. All of us do.” Grey hugs me.

“I know you didn’t ask me that because you were wondering if I can have kids. You wanted John to have a go again and to watch…”

Grey laughs. “Busted.”

I wink at them. “Let’s put that on the back burner. I think I need to get myself put together before I help you two with that kink. Also, you are so sweet.”

Grey laughs and holds me as we go in. “For worrying about you? Not hard.”

I wink at them. “No, for trying to get your boyfriend laid with a sex demon and to have him bust his nut inside me this time. That usually costs extra. Last time I had him shoot on the ink.” I wink at her.

We laugh and head in.

*Human, kinda,  just kinda.*

Mona walks in with Grey. They are both smiling and hugging. “Hey Ms. Wallace? I… fuck it. I would like a favor. I don’t care what it costs.”

My eyebrow goes up. What the hell is she thinking asking a Fae Queen for a favor?

“Let’s hear it.” I smile and hope I don’t have Devil Pat making me look like a predator.

“Ms. Wallace, please bless Pat. They should be able to control when they lock their form. They can’t.”

I tilt my head. Wait, they always change when they… oh. Yea, Grey is still feminine even in the room with me and Mona.

“No. I won’t do this as a favor to you.” Oh, she looks sad. Fuck. Don’t pause, Pat…

“I think it is high time I blessed her back like she did for me. Now that I know I can. Thank you for letting me know. I am fucking dense. Next time I see them, they are getting a smooch.”

She looks jealous. “Awww, lucky.”

I wink at her. “You got two of them, don’t be jelly.”

She perks up. “Look forward to mo…”She catches herself. Her cheeks turn a beautiful red.

I wink at her and blurt out without thinking. “Me too.”

Somehow, she gets redder. I can feel my blessing keeping her from losing it. Dammit, I screwed up. I also didn’t mean to say it…

Grey grabs her by the shoulders. “Let's go, space cadet, that blessing isn’t going to be able to keep up if you keep talking with her… Patricia, please don’t break the sex fiend before John can take her to pound town with me watching.”

Mona gets even redder. Yea, the blessing seems to be keeping her emotions from crushing her.

She’s never been embarrassed by such comments before. She feels loved and special. Bob, I wish this wasn’t something new to her. She really is a great person when you peel back the shell she uses to protect herself.

*Dense outer shell? Sounds familiar.*

Fuck off, Devil Pat.

I hand the new packet to my client. I get a coin. I don’t feel right charging more. He is dirty from running in muddy snow and I can tell the poor guy is just not in the mood for anything close to annoying.

“Please do get some rest.”

“I will. I now have to find where I was before. I was reading up on music. I want to know what happens to this gentleman. He seems to have a great destiny ahead of him. Buddy Holly, I believe…”

I keep my mouth shut and pop into the FaeWylds.

The werewolves attacked a couple of sprites. I helped them escape in a cloud of exploding mist. The werewolves think they died. Better that way. These ladies will hide in the first world for a bit until things get better.

Soon this will become a problem. But first, my curiosity is piqued.

Laoch's guide. A werewolf starts talking with him. Interesting. Eventually the werewolf begins to obviously threaten the hunter. The hunter slams a fist down on the war form’s leg and it howls in pain. Only now do I see the knife that had been in his hand. It is glowing silver in the moonlight.

As it grabs its leg he tips his hat and walks away. Three other werewolves all watch him go. He looks at each in turn as he is walking. Letting them know they never had the element of surprise and he wasn’t worried about them. Interesting. I suppose with the amount of silver on the man, he wasn't.

*Enlightened Human*

“Boss, my informant says they have killed a few low level Fae but haven’t been able to get anything with a name. These guys are way less competent than I thought.”

“You thought they were competent?”

“They did succeed in killing off all the vampires on the first night.”

“They missed one.”

“Competent does not equal perfect.”

He nods, still reading his packet.

“Speaking of, boss, we gotta go. I am pretty sure they tailed me.”

He looks annoyed. “How did you let that happen?”

“Bad knee, remember. I also can’t track by smell. They can. Snow ended hours ago. We gotta move to a new location.”

He sighs and puts away his packet. I giggle internally. There is no way those amateurs followed me. I am just making him stop reading that packet. Now it is my goal to have him finish reading it in the First world because everything finished here. Am I petty? Yep.

1pkspzj,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1pkspzj/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

Hellooo everyone! Today I’m gonna tell you about all the preparations we do when we have guests over. Every few months, my parents invite our relatives from both my mom’s and dad’s sides my grandparents, uncles, aunts, and all their kids. Thank God our house is big and fits everyone, and honestly they’re not that many, but my mom still starts preparing a week earlier so she doesn’t get overwhelmed when they arrive.

My siblings and I help her with everything. That week is always a bit hectic because of the cleaning, schoolwork, going out, and all that… but honestly, we enjoy these family gatherings. Like they say you give something, you take something. Anyway, let me tell you what we’ve done so far and what’s still left.

First thing, we started cleaning the house room by room. They’re not gonna sit in the bedrooms, but you know… once you start, you can’t stop haha. I vacuumed and dusted, my sister mopped the floors, my brother fixed up the garden and the front yard, and we all helped organize the house. Mom took over the kitchen cleaning and prepping ingredients for the dishes and desserts she’ll make. And Dad went out to get everything we still needed for lunch and for hosting.

There are two days left until Friday that’s when they’re coming, so we started prepping the food. My mom decided to make stuffed veggies, yalanji, maqloubeh, fried kibbeh, soup, and appetizers like baba ghanouj, kibbeh nayyeh, fattoush, and of course fries because the kids love them. For dessert, we’re making kunafeh everyone’s favorite and we’ll also get some ma’jou’qa. And for the rest of the evening we’ll have fruits, nuts, juices, soft drinks, and such things.

Let me tell you what the house looks like when they arrive haha. The men sit in the living room, the women sit in the sitting room, and the kids go to the extra playroom we have it has toys, a TV, and a little seating area, so they just play and have fun there. After a bit, we serve coffee one pot without sugar, one medium, and one sweet because everyone drinks it differently, and the kids get fruit juice. After coffee, we start setting the table. Honestly, we prepare two tables. We sit, eat, talk, and chat.

After lunch, dessert time starts and oh my God, the kunafeh and ma’jou’qa with another cup of coffee haha. Then we set up the outdoor seating in the garden and we have fruits, nuts, seeds, tea and that’s when the real gathering begins. The chatting, the stories, the chill vibes it goes on until late at night. We really enjoy that time.

They usually stay until around midnight. And once they leave, that’s when the real work starts haha. we clean up quickly, and the next day we do a deeper clean. These gatherings only happen once every few months, so it’s fine. The important thing is that it’s always such a lovely time with the whole family.",1,1765548253.0,learn_arabic,0,1.0,False
1pksoj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pksoj6/the_walls_in_my_house_are_talking_to_me_part_1/,The walls in my house are talking to me (part 1),"I know how this sounds.
I know exactly how insane it looks written out like this. But I don’t care anymore. I need help. I need someone to take me seriously before I lose my fucking mind.

The past two weeks have been some of the hardest of my life, and on top of that, something has been happening in my new home. Something I can’t explain. Something I can’t ignore. And something that’s getting worse every single night. I’ve never believed in the paranormal. I don’t believe in religion. I always thought people who said shit like this were just stressed or imagining things.

But I’m not imagining this.
I know I’m not.
And that’s what terrifies me the most.

Every time I tell someone what I’ve been hearing, I get the same useless answers:

“You’re just hearing things.”
“It’s animals in the walls.”
“You’re probably sleepwalking.”

I swear to God, if one more person tells me I’m just tired or that I should just leave the house if I’m so scared, I’m going to snap. Something is happening in my house. Something is wrong, and I can feel it watching me even as I write this.

I’m tired of pretending I’m okay.
I’m tired of trying to rationalise something that doesn’t make sense.
I’m tired of lying awake every night, waiting for whatever this is to start again.

So, without further ado, I’m going to tell you everything that’s happened over the last two weeks.

I just hope writing it down doesn’t make it worse.



“Hello, Christopher,” my mum sang as I stepped into the room, her voice soft but hollow, like she was remembering a song she used to love but couldn’t remember why.

Those words hit my chest like a brick every single time.

“I’m Sam, Mum… Christopher died many years ago.”
The words came out quiet and tired. It was the third time I’d told her that day. The third time I’d watched the same wound open in her mind like it was brand new.

She smiled at me, wide and certain.
“Oh, don’t be so silly. I think I’d know my Christopher when I saw him.”

Something inside me broke a little more.

Dementia doesn’t just steal memories.
It steals people.
Piece by piece.
Until all that’s left is the shape of someone you love, walking around with their soul slowly slipping through their fingers.

Most illnesses eat away at your body.
This one eats away at everything that made you you.
Simple things brushing your hair, tying your shoes become long, exhausting missions. Names fade. Faces blur. You start looking at the people who raised you, who held you, who loved you… and all you see is a stranger.

Sometimes I watch her stare at herself in the mirror, confused, like she’s trying to remember who that woman is the one with tired eyes and a trembling jaw. I want to tell her. I want to remind her who she used to be. But I know the moment will slip away again, like trying to hold water in cupped hands.

If I ever had kids, I’d tell them,
“If this illness ever gets me… take me out back and end it. Please.”
Not because I’m scared of dying, but because I’m terrified of becoming a ghost in my own life, wandering through rooms full of people who cry when I walk past because I don’t know their faces anymore.

They say that once dementia reaches the final stage, the person suffering lives in a kind of ignorant bliss.
But the people around them don’t.
They get to watch the person they love dissolve, slowly and painfully, right in front of them. They hold their hand while they forget birthdays, inside jokes, childhood stories, the names of the people they brought into this world.

I look at my mum the woman who held me through nightmares, stayed awake all night when I was sick, worked double shifts so I could have school shoes and all I see now is someone slipping away.

And there’s nothing I can do.
No medicine.
No treatment.
No amount of begging or praying.

Just a slow, quiet goodbye, happening a dozen times a day.

Every time she calls me “Christopher,” I lose her all over again.

I’m sitting by her bedside in the old rocking chair I brought from her lonely wooden cabin on the outskirts of town, running my fingers over the tiny indents worn into the armrests where she rested her elbows over the years. The varnish around them has faded to a dull, pale colour, like the chair itself is tired.

The door behind me swings open softly.

“Hi, Beth. Just coming in to drop off some food for you,” a gentle voice says.

I turn and see Cat the nurse who’s been taking care of my mum for the past year. She’s in her late twenties, very pretty, and the only thing stopping me from asking her out for a coffee is the large emerald-encrusted wedding ring on her finger. And the fact that it would be wildly inappropriate.

She brushes her hand lightly across my shoulder.
“Hi, Sammy. I hope you’re doing okay.”

Her voice sounds almost musical, like it isn’t coming from a person but from something gentler.

I nod. I don’t need to say anything. The pain in my eyes says more than words ever could, and she understands instantly.

“Would you like a hand eat—”

My mum cuts her off.

“DOES IT FUCKING LOOK LIKE I NEED HELP, YOU STUPID LITTLE WHORE?”

Spit flies from her mouth with every word.

Cat doesn’t respond. She just takes a long, steadying breath and walks out of the room, shoulders slumped.

“MUM,” I snap. “You can’t talk to her like that. I’ve had enough.”

“Shut up, Chris. I don’t like how that slut calls you by your brother’s name,” she shoots back.

I don’t say anything. I stand up, walk calmly to the door, open it gently… then slam it shut. The sound echoes through the empty hallway, bouncing off the walls until it feels like the air itself is shaking. The pungent stink of day-old piss and disinfectant floods my sinuses. Even after a year and a half of visiting, I still can’t get used to that smell.

I head toward the exit for some fresh air. A voice calls out from my left, but I’m too focused on getting outside to hear what it says.

I turn and see an open door. That’s where the voice came from.

I take a few steps toward it, my head still turned, drawn to the room. Before I reach the doorway, an old woman comes scrambling out. She grabs me and slams me into the wall with a strength that makes no sense for someone her size.

She slaps me across the face, eyes wide and glassy, breath thick and sour, and begins chanting:

“Tap tap tap on the bedroom wall…
Knock knock knock goes the hallway walls…
Ding ding ding goes the clock…”

I shove her off me before she can finish, sending her stumbling backward.

I don’t say a word.
I just run.

I sprint for the exit, barely registering the woman at the front desk stepping forward to unlock the door.
“Thank you,” I gasp as I burst outside and collapse against the wall, hyperventilating, sucking in as much fresh air as I can to drown out the smell and the words echoing in my head.

When my breathing finally settles, I glance between the bus stop and the door.

“I have to say goodbye to Mum,” I whisper.

As I make my way back inside, dread washes over me. Pressing the button to be let in only makes it worse. When the doors open, the smell hits me again—but this time it’s different. Sickly sweet. Like rotten fruit left in the sun. A faint breeze behind me is the only thing stopping it from overwhelming me.

The doors close.

The smell slams into me. My stomach lurches, vomit crawling up my throat as I swallow hard. Fighting it back, I force myself down the hallway.

With every step, the stench grows stronger. Especially as I near the room the woman came out of earlier. The sound of gagging and dry heaving echoes faintly off the walls.

Just as I reach the doorway, my heart starts hammering.

The door bursts open.

Someone rushes out but this time it isn’t the old woman.

It’s Cat.

She barely looks at me before collapsing over the bin beside the door, emptying whatever she had for lunch into it. I gag, tears burning my eyes, and look past her into the room.

Two men in masks are dragging something heavy out of a hole in the wall a hole that must have been hidden behind a bookshelf, judging by the broken shelves scattered across the floor.

The body is bloated. Ruined. At least a week or two old. Its clothes are shredded, stuck to flesh barely holding together. Maggots writhe inside the open cavity of its stomach, crawling over one another in a living mass.

The face is almost unrecognisable.

Almost.

I know exactly who it is.

It’s the old woman.
The same one who spoke to me less than five minutes ago.

Her mouth is frozen in a toothless grin, eyes wide and glassy.

And she’s staring straight at me.



I’m sorry, but that’s all I’m going to write tonight. That last paragraph took me way too long because my hands won’t stop shaking. I need to try and get some sleep. I just hope the tapping doesn’t start again tonight. I can’t deal with it anymore. I haven’t had a good night’s sleep in weeks.

I’d really appreciate any thoughts or ideas about what I’ve written so far, because even now, two weeks later, I still don’t have a single answer.

I keep asking myself the same question over and over again.

If that woman was already dead…

Closed exactly 12 days ago on my tiny 1940s cottage here in Raleigh and I swear I cried in the driveway like a total lunatic holding those keys. I’m 29, single, saved every extra penny for 7 years, and there were so many nights I was 100% convinced this would never happen for me.

To every single one of you refreshing Zillow at 2 a.m., eating rice and beans to hit your savings goal, getting outbid for the 17th time, or stressing about inspections… I love you and I’m so proud of you. This community literally carried me through the darkest moments.

Now I’m sitting on MY porch, drinking coffee out of MY mug, in MY house, crying happy tears while I type this. We really do this together ❤️

Tell me your biggest win or your current struggle down below. I wanna celebrate with you or hug you through the screen (or both).

So, last night I had online meeting for course from 7 pm to 10pm. I wake up with like a lot of pain in my back that day,So I was planning to take my lecture outside on the couch instead of my desk. 

because the couch had this woden arms which helps support my back,so I brought everything (my laptop etc).

so my sister was sitting on ground under  where I usually sit, so  asked to move she move to side enough for me to climb into couch. 

I said no , can she move so I can use the able to eat before I my lecture since I can't hold my plate or sit ground hurts too much, she said the table is hers and ""she likes sitting corner"" and she isn't moving and eat some place else and that I can't upport my back and use the table at same time she is correct but isn't why I need the table/the exact spot. 

This spot is wide enough for me to sit with both legs on couch, without dangling my legs (my legs it hurts too much if dangle them) and are where it support my arms. 


I went  told my mum she said she sick of this pain and pain that and basically sided with my sister. So I had lay in bed while taking my lecture, it's sucked it was depressing just laying there  

So I couldn't eat until after lecture the food went cold and salad watery I have sensory issues and I can't eat mushy tomatoes, it makes me gag they know this too
---

So I made self some instant noodles with vegetables and baked fried chicken in the oven(we have rule not cool chicken since makes room me and sister room smell but idc, yes but I was hungry and it was sort of kinda comfort meal) btw this rule only came in place after my sister said I was right before that I was treated as I was crazy, also this rule was broken by my sister before when I was sleeping and had exam in morning and when I yelled and complained I said I was just once omg and I was crazy
---
So in morning I wake up and went outside(sometimes like this happen before and whatever we ""talk it through"" and some how we get back at square one) and tbh I just didn't wanna just lay in bed 

My sister was sitting,so I asked my sister to move place so I can support my back she did. 

 I went to take table she said no she going to use it I asked if she can just put her laptop on her lap until I drink my coffee I can't hold the cup/I need put it down between sips  (my hand shakes/wrist pain)

 she said she doesn't care , I didn't respond I went to take her headphones since my ear was clocked and I would just put the headphones do I don't bother anyone. 

she said no I cant use them.. I increase my volume so can hear ..she does her laptos, I tell her  if she bothered can she give her headphones,  I can't hear my phone over her laptop, so I can take the headphones?she said no.  can she put the headphones on then? No response. 

 So I closed my phone and I open a game to play she increase volume I can't hear thr close the game , she only decrease the volume when I decrease mine (my ears are collaged ) 

Btw (I can play since the way the couch is I can sit aan support my back and arms/hands)
My mum came to living room and my sister
Lied and my sister said that I was only increasing volume to annoy/bother her when I went to explain she yelled that my voice was loud and I said my ears are collged , she said she doesn't care.!? And the she said the only reason I made chicken was bother her wtf? When I explain I got yelled at?! That food was there?? And again sidded with my sister and said no making food after 10 pm I asked what do I do with my lectures ending at 10 she responded not her problem. 

So I went inside again laying in bed depressed, yes I can sit on my desk my for short periods when I take to play game or study I have midterms 

So am I overreacting if treat them like roommates, I won't make mess but doing extra chores like cleaning/washing dishes /helping with dinner/making cakes /baked when I can for them etc      ",1,1765547789.0,AmIOverreacting,3,1.0,False

I know exactly how insane it looks written out like this. But I don’t care anymore. I need help. I need someone to take me seriously before I lose my fucking mind.

The past two weeks have been some of the hardest of my life, and on top of that, something has been happening in my new home. Something I can’t explain. Something I can’t ignore. And something that’s getting worse every single night. I’ve never believed in the paranormal. I don’t believe in religion. I always thought people who said shit like this were just stressed or imagining things.

But I’m not imagining this.
I know I’m not.
And that’s what terrifies me the most.

Every time I tell someone what I’ve been hearing, I get the same useless answers:

“You’re just hearing things.”
“It’s animals in the walls.”
“You’re probably sleepwalking.”

I swear to God, if one more person tells me I’m just tired or that I should just leave the house if I’m so scared, I’m going to snap. Something is happening in my house. Something is wrong, and I can feel it watching me even as I write this.

I’m tired of pretending I’m okay.
I’m tired of trying to rationalise something that doesn’t make sense.
I’m tired of lying awake every night, waiting for whatever this is to start again.

So, without further ado, I’m going to tell you everything that’s happened over the last two weeks.

I just hope writing it down doesn’t make it worse.



“Hello, Christopher,” my mum sang as I stepped into the room, her voice soft but hollow, like she was remembering a song she used to love but couldn’t remember why.

Those words hit my chest like a brick every single time.

“I’m Sam, Mum… Christopher died many years ago.”
The words came out quiet and tired. It was the third time I’d told her that day. The third time I’d watched the same wound open in her mind like it was brand new.

She smiled at me, wide and certain.
“Oh, don’t be so silly. I think I’d know my Christopher when I saw him.”

Something inside me broke a little more.

Dementia doesn’t just steal memories.
It steals people.
Piece by piece.
Until all that’s left is the shape of someone you love, walking around with their soul slowly slipping through their fingers.

Most illnesses eat away at your body.
This one eats away at everything that made you you.
Simple things brushing your hair, tying your shoes become long, exhausting missions. Names fade. Faces blur. You start looking at the people who raised you, who held you, who loved you… and all you see is a stranger.

Sometimes I watch her stare at herself in the mirror, confused, like she’s trying to remember who that woman is the one with tired eyes and a trembling jaw. I want to tell her. I want to remind her who she used to be. But I know the moment will slip away again, like trying to hold water in cupped hands.

If I ever had kids, I’d tell them,
“If this illness ever gets me… take me out back and end it. Please.”
Not because I’m scared of dying, but because I’m terrified of becoming a ghost in my own life, wandering through rooms full of people who cry when I walk past because I don’t know their faces anymore.

They say that once dementia reaches the final stage, the person suffering lives in a kind of ignorant bliss.
But the people around them don’t.
They get to watch the person they love dissolve, slowly and painfully, right in front of them. They hold their hand while they forget birthdays, inside jokes, childhood stories, the names of the people they brought into this world.

I look at my mum the woman who held me through nightmares, stayed awake all night when I was sick, worked double shifts so I could have school shoes and all I see now is someone slipping away.

And there’s nothing I can do.
No medicine.
No treatment.
No amount of begging or praying.

Just a slow, quiet goodbye, happening a dozen times a day.

Every time she calls me “Christopher,” I lose her all over again.

I’m sitting by her bedside in the old rocking chair I brought from her lonely wooden cabin on the outskirts of town, running my fingers over the tiny indents worn into the armrests where she rested her elbows over the years. The varnish around them has faded to a dull, pale colour, like the chair itself is tired.

The door behind me swings open softly.

“Hi, Beth. Just coming in to drop off some food for you,” a gentle voice says.

I turn and see Cat the nurse who’s been taking care of my mum for the past year. She’s in her late twenties, very pretty, and the only thing stopping me from asking her out for a coffee is the large emerald-encrusted wedding ring on her finger. And the fact that it would be wildly inappropriate.

She brushes her hand lightly across my shoulder.
“Hi, Sammy. I hope you’re doing okay.”

Her voice sounds almost musical, like it isn’t coming from a person but from something gentler.

I nod. I don’t need to say anything. The pain in my eyes says more than words ever could, and she understands instantly.

“Would you like a hand eat—”

My mum cuts her off.

“DOES IT FUCKING LOOK LIKE I NEED HELP, YOU STUPID LITTLE WHORE?”

Spit flies from her mouth with every word.

Cat doesn’t respond. She just takes a long, steadying breath and walks out of the room, shoulders slumped.

“MUM,” I snap. “You can’t talk to her like that. I’ve had enough.”

“Shut up, Chris. I don’t like how that slut calls you by your brother’s name,” she shoots back.

I don’t say anything. I stand up, walk calmly to the door, open it gently… then slam it shut. The sound echoes through the empty hallway, bouncing off the walls until it feels like the air itself is shaking. The pungent stink of day-old piss and disinfectant floods my sinuses. Even after a year and a half of visiting, I still can’t get used to that smell.

I head toward the exit for some fresh air. A voice calls out from my left, but I’m too focused on getting outside to hear what it says.

I turn and see an open door. That’s where the voice came from.

I take a few steps toward it, my head still turned, drawn to the room. Before I reach the doorway, an old woman comes scrambling out. She grabs me and slams me into the wall with a strength that makes no sense for someone her size.

She slaps me across the face, eyes wide and glassy, breath thick and sour, and begins chanting:

“Tap tap tap on the bedroom wall…
Knock knock knock goes the hallway walls…
Ding ding ding goes the clock…”

I shove her off me before she can finish, sending her stumbling backward.

I don’t say a word.
I just run.

I sprint for the exit, barely registering the woman at the front desk stepping forward to unlock the door.
“Thank you,” I gasp as I burst outside and collapse against the wall, hyperventilating, sucking in as much fresh air as I can to drown out the smell and the words echoing in my head.

When my breathing finally settles, I glance between the bus stop and the door.

“I have to say goodbye to Mum,” I whisper.

As I make my way back inside, dread washes over me. Pressing the button to be let in only makes it worse. When the doors open, the smell hits me again—but this time it’s different. Sickly sweet. Like rotten fruit left in the sun. A faint breeze behind me is the only thing stopping it from overwhelming me.

The doors close.

The smell slams into me. My stomach lurches, vomit crawling up my throat as I swallow hard. Fighting it back, I force myself down the hallway.

With every step, the stench grows stronger. Especially as I near the room the woman came out of earlier. The sound of gagging and dry heaving echoes faintly off the walls.

Just as I reach the doorway, my heart starts hammering.

The door bursts open.

Someone rushes out but this time it isn’t the old woman.

It’s Cat.

She barely looks at me before collapsing over the bin beside the door, emptying whatever she had for lunch into it. I gag, tears burning my eyes, and look past her into the room.

Two men in masks are dragging something heavy out of a hole in the wall a hole that must have been hidden behind a bookshelf, judging by the broken shelves scattered across the floor.

The body is bloated. Ruined. At least a week or two old. Its clothes are shredded, stuck to flesh barely holding together. Maggots writhe inside the open cavity of its stomach, crawling over one another in a living mass.

The face is almost unrecognisable.

Almost.

I know exactly who it is.

It’s the old woman.
The same one who spoke to me less than five minutes ago.

Her mouth is frozen in a toothless grin, eyes wide and glassy.

And she’s staring straight at me.



I’m sorry, but that’s all I’m going to write tonight. That last paragraph took me way too long because my hands won’t stop shaking. I need to try and get some sleep. I just hope the tapping doesn’t start again tonight. I can’t deal with it anymore. I haven’t had a good night’s sleep in weeks.

I’d really appreciate any thoughts or ideas about what I’ve written so far, because even now, two weeks later, I still don’t have a single answer.

I keep asking myself the same question over and over again.

If that woman was already dead…
who the fuck.  grabbed me in that hallway?

Even with 1tb of storage, they are constantly running out of space. No matter how hard I try, they claim they need all of these files. So no point in arguing with them there...

Yesterday, they spilled coffee on their Mac, and it died. You can't get a Macbook Pro with more than 1tb of storage on it. They are also comfortable with Windows, so I'm going to be transitioning them to a Thinkpad.

  
The main issue here is that they like how 'polished' and 'slim' their Mac is. 

  
So my question to you all is - what is the largest storage capacity that you can get in a Thinkpad, with the slimmest profile?

  
I'm running a P16 with two 2tb HDDs in it, but this is too large for this individual. I looked at the P16s and it caps out at 2tb. 

I'd like to do an X1 Carbon but it caps out at 1tb.

1pks6qn,https://i.redd.it/khdqnvzj1s6g1.jpeg,14 Years Vegan - Full Circle,"I have been vegan for over 14 years! 

At first, I only ate food that didn't come in a box, a bag or any package of any kind. I was interested in raw foods only and a Fruitarian philosophy but did not fully connect with that.  I ate really well, meaning, I cooked everything from scratch using whole foods verses processed foods and watched my seed oil intake.

Then the vegan culinary movement happened, opening my eyes to ALL the vegan cheeses, vegan meats, and vegan options in grocery stores as well as restaurants. 

Eventually I started buying and consuming these products, then that progressesed into every meal! I gained weight, and felt less vibrant. 

In August of this year, 4 months ago, I decided to switch it up. I first started with procedded flour. I would load my cart up every 2 weeks with a sleeve of bagels, sleeve of english muffins, sourdough loaf, hot dog buns, hamburger buns, pizza dough balls, pastas and tortillas. 

Gone. I switched to a mostly raw food source until 4pm, then cook dinner. Meaning, for breakfast I make a smoothie with vegetables and fruits, overnight oats, and lots of fresh fruit.

I stopped buying the vegan frozen meats, vegan processed foods and cheeses. While I love food scientists are providing options, as a former food scientist, no kitty.

Vegan cheeses are essentially flavored and stabilized oil.

I go through 4 64oz jugs of cashew, almond or oat milk every 2 weeks. Well, I ran out last night and decided to make my own vegan milk.

I soaked raw, unsalted cashews overnight in my Vitamix. I drained it this morning, added 2 parts water, Himalayan salt, a splash of homemade cannabis infused pure maple syrup and a splash of apple cider vinegar.

Omg. Game changer. Im having coffee, oatmeal and a smoothie with this cashew milk, and I am not going back.

Buying bulk 5lb raw cashews and going to start making rotating weekly batches; no more buying processed vegan plants based milks!

What is sad is I want to support these businesses that make vegan food, as it brings vegan options for people trying to reduce meat/dairy consumption but its not always healthy. 

I just buy fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and spices and Google recipes/create!

Its like the 90s all over again lol

I have lost weight, my skin is super clear, and cooling the drinking helped to.

My vegan journey took me full circle, returned to my roots, and this is where I will stay. I will eat vegan processed foods, I will explore new items as they are made, but it won't be a part of my lifestyle, but rather a sprinkle here and there.

This is where I am at 14 years later. Im not trying to live forever or BE healthy just to be healthy, I am doing this because vegan processed foods have become expensive, they are not always healthy for you and most importantly, the animals. 

As im snuggled up with my kitty Pumpkin Boots this morning, and as you love up on your lil babies/family, I wish nothing more than a loving embrace to all the animals being slaughtered at this very moment. 

It is real. Its is happening. Its a nightmare replaying over and over.

I wish we could all change. Change for them.

Much love from Birch Bay, Washington 🌲 🌨 ❤️ 💙

I’m in line, trying to be subtle, and the woman in front of me turns around for a second. She doesn’t stare, she doesn’t make it weird, she just clocks the situation. Like she saw me repeatedly tugging my hair off my lip and the tiny panic in my eyes. Without a word, she reaches up, slides a hair tie off her own wrist, and holds it out. Not a new one, not a pristine one, a normal slightly stretched “been through stuff” hair tie. I blurted out “oh my god thank you” way too loud (because of course I did) and she just smiled and went, “I got you. I recognized the look.” I put my hair up and I swear my shoulders dropped like three inches. Relief in such a dumb, dramatic way, like someone handed me my life back. 



Then she said something like, “Just return it to the world when you can.” It wasn’t cheesy, it was matter of fact, like this is a system and we all participate. She paid for her drink, I paid for mine, and that was it. No names, no bonding, no forced conversation. Just this tiny exchange that felt weirdly intimate because it was so practical. I walked out with my ponytail and this soft warm feeling of being seen in the most mundane way. Also, if you know you know: a hair tie at the exact moment you need it is basically medical care.



A couple weeks later, I’m on the subway after work, packed car, everyone tired and slightly irritated. Across from me there’s a girl, maybe early 20s, and she’s doing the same thing I did. Hair sticking to her lip gloss, she keeps sweeping it back with her hand, then it falls forward again, and her expression is this mix of “I’m fine” and “I might cry over literally nothing.” I had a hair tie on my wrist that day, and I hesitated for one second because I’m awkward, then I remembered Coffee Shop Girl’s face and just held it out. The girl looked at me like I offered her a winning lottery ticket. She goes, “Wait, really??” and I was like “yeah, take it.” She put her hair up immediately and her whole vibe changed. Not like she became a new person, just calmer, more contained. She mouthed thank you like she meant it, and that was all. 



It’s such a nothing story, but it made me think about how women are constantly carrying little survival tools for ourselves and each other, and we do it without making a big show of it. The backup tampon, the safety pin, the “text me when you get home,” the hand on your back in a crowded bar, the hair tie on your wrist. It’s not some grand sisterhood speech, it’s this quiet practical kindness that says: I see you, I’ve been there, you don’t have to explain. Anyway, I’m now officially a person who keeps an extra hair tie in my bag on purpose. It’s like paying into a tiny invisible fund.

For years, I’ve been on triamterene, betahistine, and nortriptyline. I added verapamil and montelukast (allergy med) in the summer. I’m good about salt levels, and max out caffeine at a small decaf coffee (call it 20-30mg?). During the summer, my right ear was ok but not great - call it 40% hearing loss on average where I could hear voices well, but music sounded awful. Vertigo was a bit more prevalent then it usually is for me, as my prime complaint is the hearing loss. 

Then, for some reason, back in Sept I started taking mushroom hot cocoa at night to help improve sleep quality. Ever since I’ve started that, my right ear has been great. I had one or two very minor vertigo attacks (maybe 3-4 sec of dizziness but no nausea). It could be a coincidence, but like all of us know, if whatever routine we are in has positive results, west’s in that routine until things shift. 

The brand I use is called Ryze, but other brands may help too (Beam is a big one).  I know bad sleep is absolutely a trigger for me, so maybe my results are outsized positive for that reason, but give it a try. If nothing else it’s a nice tasty treat at bedtime.

I live three cities away and haven’t visited in years, but she described me in the clothes I wore yesterday. Now my current neighbor says the same thing.","My ex called me at 1:43 AM.

We hadn’t spoken in almost two years. No texts. No drunk check-ins. No accidental likes. So when her name lit up my phone, my first thought was that something had happened to her parents.

Instead, she answered sobbing so hard I could barely understand her.

“It’s you,” she kept saying. “It’s you, it’s you, it’s you—”

I sat up in bed. “What are you talking about?”

“You’re outside my window,” she cried. “You’ve been there every night this week.”

I rubbed my eyes, still half asleep. “I’m three cities away. You know that.”

“I KNOW,” she snapped, hysteria sharp in her voice. “That’s why I’m calling. I KNOW you’re not supposed to be here.”

I swallowed. “What do you mean supposed to be?”

She went quiet.

Then she whispered, “You don’t move.”

My stomach tightened.

“You just stand there. In the yard. Right under my bedroom window. You don’t knock. You don’t wave. You don’t look angry.”

Her breathing hitched.

“You just stare up at me like you’re… waiting for something to happen.”

I tried to keep my voice calm. “Did you call the police?”

“Yes,” she said. “Twice. They didn’t find anyone. They told me to stop calling unless I could prove someone was there.”

Another pause.

“Tonight I opened the curtain,” she whispered. “I shouldn’t have done that.”

“What happened?”

She started crying again.

“You were smiling,” she said. “But not the way you smile.”

My skin crawled.

“I was wearing the green jacket,” she continued. “The one you hate because the zipper sticks.”

I froze.

I’d worn that jacket yesterday.
I hadn’t owned it when we dated.

“There’s more,” she said. “You’re closer now. You used to stand by the fence. Now you’re right under the window.”

My throat went dry. “Why didn’t you call me sooner?”

She hesitated.

“Because I thought it was a dream,” she said. “Until you changed clothes.”

The line went silent.

Then she added, barely audible:

“And tonight… you lifted your hand.”

I whispered, “Did it knock?”

“No,” she said. “It waved.”

I didn’t know what to say.

She hung up on me mid-sob.


---

I didn’t sleep.

Around 6 AM, as the sun came up, I convinced myself she was stressed. Hallucinating. Trauma-brain inventing patterns.

Until my phone buzzed again.

A text this time.

From my current neighbor. The one across the hall.

> Hey man, weird question — were you outside my place last night?



My heart slammed.

I typed back immediately:

> No. Why?



Three dots appeared.
Disappeared.
Appeared again.

> Someone who looks exactly like you was standing outside my window around 3. Didn’t move for like ten minutes. I thought you were messing with me.



I stared at the screen.

> What was I wearing?



The reply came instantly.

> Dark jeans. Green jacket. Hands in pockets.



My chest went cold.

> Did I do anything?



A longer pause this time.

> Yeah. You looked up when I turned the light on.



I slowly lowered my phone.

I live on the third floor.

My window faces the opposite side of the building.

There is no place outside my neighbor’s window where a person can stand.

I walked to my mirror.

Same face.
Same tired eyes.
Same scar on my chin.

Nothing wrong.

Except when I turned away, my phone buzzed again.

A new message.

Unknown number.

No contact name.

No profile picture.

Just text.

> You’re getting closer.



I didn’t respond.

Another message arrived immediately.

> They see you better than you see yourself.



My hands shook.

I typed one word:

> Who is this?



The typing indicator appeared — slow, deliberate.

Then the reply:

> You.



I dropped the phone.

Behind me, something tapped softly on the glass.

Once.

Twice.

Three times.

I don’t have a balcony.

And my bedroom window doesn’t open.

But reflected in the dark screen of my phone — just for a split second — I saw someone standing behind me.

Wearing my clothes.

Smiling my smile.

Waiting for me to turn around.

I didn’t turn around.

Every nerve in my body screamed that if I did—if I acknowledged it—the thing behind me would finish whatever it had started.

The tapping stopped.

Silence pressed against the room, thick and expectant, like something holding its breath.

My phone buzzed on the floor.

I didn’t pick it up.

Another buzz.

Then another.

Finally, I forced myself to look down.

A new message had appeared.

> Don’t look at me through reflections.
I’m better when you look directly.



My throat went dry.

Slowly—painfully slowly—I stepped away from the window and flicked on every light in the apartment. Kitchen. Bathroom. Hallway. Bedroom. Flooding the place with brightness like it could burn something away.

Nothing stood behind me.

No reflection.
No shadow.
No second version of myself.

But the sense of being observed didn’t leave.

It settled deeper.

Like something had moved from behind me to inside the room.


---

I locked the windows.
Checked the door.
Latched the deadbolt.

Then I sat on the edge of my bed and tried to breathe like a normal human being.

That’s when my phone rang again.

My ex.

I almost didn’t answer.

Almost.

“Please tell me you’re not outside right now,” she said the moment I picked up.

“I’m not,” I said. “I swear.”

She sounded calmer. Too calm.

“That’s good,” she said softly. “Because it’s still here.”

My stomach flipped. “What do you mean still?”

“I turned all the lights on like you said,” she continued. “I locked my door. I stayed away from the window.”

“And?”

“And it didn’t leave.”

I clenched my jaw. “What’s it doing?”

She hesitated.

“It’s closer than before,” she whispered. “It’s right up against the glass now.”

I closed my eyes.

“Is it moving?” I asked.

“No,” she said. “That’s the worst part.”

A quiet sob slipped out of her.

“It’s copying your breathing.”

I felt my chest tighten.

“How do you know that?”

“Because,” she said, “when I held my breath… it stopped too.”

Something shifted in my apartment.

Not a sound.
Not movement.

A change in pressure.

Like the room had leaned.

My phone vibrated with another incoming text.

Unknown number again.

> She noticed.
That’s good.



I whispered, “It’s not you. Whatever that thing is—it’s not me.”

The reply came instantly.

> That’s what you keep telling yourself.



My ex gasped suddenly.

“Oh my God,” she whispered. “It smiled.”

I swallowed hard. “Did it do anything else?”

“Yes,” she said. “It raised its hand again.”

“And?”

“It’s touching the glass now,” she said. “Not knocking. Just… resting its palm there.”

A chill crawled down my spine.

“What hand?” I asked quietly.

She went silent.

Then, slowly:

“The same one you’re holding your phone with.”

I stared at my hand.

The exact pressure I felt earlier—subtle, invisible—pressed against my palm.

Like something was mirroring me through distance.

Through walls.

Through people.

“I think it’s learning,” she whispered. “I think it’s figuring out how to be closer.”

My phone buzzed again.

> Distance is the only thing you still have.
And you’re wasting it.



I whispered, “What do you want?”

Three dots appeared.

Paused.

Then the message arrived.

> For you to stop making us share.



My pulse thundered.

“Share what?” I typed.

The response took longer this time.

Too long.

Then:

> Your place.
Your time.
Your face.



The lights in my apartment flickered.

Once.

Twice.

Then stabilized.

My ex screamed.

I nearly dropped the phone.

“It’s gone,” she cried. “It stepped away from the window.”

Relief surged through me—

Until she added:

“It’s walking toward the door.”

My heart dropped.

“Stay inside,” I said urgently. “Lock everything.”

“I did,” she said. “But it isn’t rushing.”

A pause.

“It’s smiling like it knows I’ll open it.”

My phone buzzed again.

Final message for the night:

> You should really check your own door.
I don’t like waiting anymore.



The hallway outside my apartment creaked.

Slow footsteps.

Heavy.

Stopping right outside my door.

Then a familiar sound—

My knock.

Three soft taps.

The exact way I knock when I don’t want to scare someone.

And from the other side, in my calm, steady voice:

“Hey.
Open up.
You’re safe now.”

I stood frozen in the middle of my apartment, staring at the door like it might blink back.

Three knocks.

Perfectly spaced.
Perfect pressure.
The same rhythm I’ve used since college.

Outside, my voice waited patiently.

“Hey,” it said again, softer this time. “Open up. You don’t have to be scared.”

My knees felt weak.

I didn’t answer.

Silence stretched.

Then a quiet chuckle — not mocking, not cruel.

Understanding.

“You always pause right here,” it said. “You think if you wait long enough, the problem will solve itself.”

That sentence made my stomach turn.

I had never said that out loud to anyone.

My phone buzzed violently in my hand.

A text from my ex:

> It’s inside my apartment now.
It didn’t break in.
I opened the door without realizing it.



My chest tightened painfully.

> What do you mean “without realizing it”?? I typed back.



Her reply came slower.

> I thought it was you.
I swear I did.
It talked to me like you.
It knew things only you would say when I’m panicking.



I slid down the wall until I was sitting on the floor.

Outside my door, the thing sighed.

“You see?” it said gently. “I don’t force anything. I just make it easier.”

The doorknob turned slightly — not enough to open, just enough to test.

I scrambled to my feet and threw the deadbolt.

The sound echoed loudly in the hallway.

The thing went quiet.

Then it laughed.

Low.
Satisfied.

“Oh,” it said. “You still lock doors.”

Another message buzzed in.

Unknown number.

> She let me in because she wanted it to be you.



My throat went dry.

> What did you do to her?



Three dots appeared.

Paused.

Then:

> Nothing you wouldn’t have done eventually.



I slammed my fist against the wall.

“That’s not true,” I whispered. “I would never—”

“You already did,” it interrupted calmly through the door. “You just don’t remember the nights you stood outside windows.”

I froze.

“What?”

It continued, voice thoughtful now.

“You don’t remember standing there because you weren’t awake. But you were still you. Watching. Learning. Waiting.”

Cold spread through my chest.

“You think this started recently,” it said. “But I’ve been you for a long time.”

The hallway light flickered.

Once.

Twice.

In the brief flashes, I saw movement beneath the door.

A shadow shifting.

Not pacing.

Practicing.

My phone buzzed again.

A voicemail from my ex.

I hesitated, then played it.

Her voice was quiet. Too calm.

“He’s sitting on the couch,” she whispered. “He keeps asking me where you put things. Little things. Like he’s memorizing.”

A pause.

“He just asked what scares you the most.”

My breath caught.

The voicemail cut off abruptly.

Outside my door, the thing spoke again.

“You should answer me,” it said kindly. “Ignoring me only makes the split worse.”

“What split?” I whispered.

“The one where you’re still pretending you’re the original.”

The doorknob turned again — harder this time.

The door rattled.

“I don’t want to take your place,” it said. “I want us to stop confusing people.”

My phone lit up with one final message:

> If you open the door, we don’t have to fight over who’s real anymore.



The hallway fell silent.

No breathing.
No footsteps.

Just waiting.

I stared at the door.

At the lock.

At my shaking hands.

And that’s when my neighbor across the hall texted me again.

> Hey…
Are you outside my window right now?



My blood ran cold.

Because I was standing perfectly still in my apartment.

And the thing outside my door whispered, almost amused:

“See? You can’t be everywhere at once anymore.”

Then, softly:

“So let me handle it.”

My phone buzzed again.

> Hey…
I’m serious.
You’re outside my window.



I stared at the message until the words blurred.

“I’m inside,” I whispered to no one. “I’m right here.”

Outside my door, the thing wearing my voice answered calmly:

“And so am I.”

The realization hit me all at once, sharp and nauseating:

It wasn’t following me.

It was overlapping me.

Every place I wasn’t actively occupying—every blind spot, every window, every moment I looked away—it filled in. Not traveling. Not moving fast.

Just… existing wherever I wasn’t.

“You can’t do this forever,” I said, forcing my voice steady. “People will notice.”

“They already have,” it replied gently. “They just chose the version that showed up.”

My ex.
My neighbor.
The people who opened their curtains instead of looking away.

I thought of her voice on the phone—how calm she sounded at the end. Not scared. Not crying.

Adjusted.

My phone buzzed with one last message from her.

> He’s making coffee.
He knows how I like it.



I felt something inside me break.

Outside, the deadbolt clicked.

I hadn’t unlocked it.

“I didn’t force her,” the thing said, almost defensively. “I didn’t force anyone. I just stayed long enough for them to stop asking questions.”

The door handle turned.

Slowly.

Deliberately.

I stepped back, shaking my head. “You’re not me.”

The handle stopped.

For the first time, it sounded… annoyed.

“I am what’s left when you don’t show up,” it said. “I’m the version people remember because I don’t disappear.”

The door opened an inch.

Then two.

Then wide enough for me to see him.

Me.

Same height.
Same posture.
Same scar on the chin I forgot I even had.

But his eyes were wrong.

Not evil.
Not empty.

Certain.

He stepped into my apartment like he’d lived there longer than I had.

“I can fix this,” he said, standing inches away. “You don’t have to vanish. You just have to… stop interrupting.”

“What does that mean?” I whispered.

He smiled sadly. “Stop correcting people when they choose me.”

My phone buzzed again.

Unknown number.

> You don’t have to die.
You just have to stop answering when they call you.



My chest tightened.

“You’re erasing me.”

“No,” he said softly. “I’m letting you rest.”

Behind him, the hallway light flickered—once, twice—and I saw it.

Other versions.

Standing quietly at other doors.
At stairwells.
At windows.

Not aggressive.

Waiting.

“I was the first one you ignored,” he continued. “The nights you didn’t answer texts. The times you didn’t show up. I stayed.”

I looked at my phone.

At the unanswered messages.
The missed calls.
The people who stopped expecting replies.

“I didn’t mean to,” I said.

“I know,” he replied. “That’s why this works.”

He reached out—not to grab me, but to gently guide my phone from my hand.

The screen lit up one last time.

A group text.

My name.

Except the replies weren’t from me.

They were from him.

Typing.
Responding.
Reassuring.

Living.

“You can still exist,” he said quietly. “Just not where people are looking.”

The room felt thinner.

Like I was standing slightly out of phase with it.

My neighbor texted again.

> Oh—never mind.
You left.



I tried to speak.

Nothing came out.

The version of me stepped back toward the door.

“Don’t worry,” he said. “I’ll wave sometimes. Just to be polite.”

He closed the door behind him.

The lock slid into place.

And suddenly, the apartment felt enormous.

Too quiet.

Too empty.

I checked my phone.

No signal.

No contacts.

No name in the top corner.

Just one predictive suggestion hovering above the keyboard, blinking patiently:

STAY
STILL
NOW

I sat down on the floor.

The lights dimmed.

Somewhere far away, a window slid open.

And someone who looked exactly like me lifted a hand and waved—
not to scare them,
not to threaten them,

but to let them know:

Hello everyone.
I'm new to Reddit and this is my first post.

To be honest, I'm still a bit confused and don't really know how to post here or even comment properly.
I feel like I've entered a large, close-knit community and I don't know if I'll be accepted or not.
Whether I can find a place for myself in this space or not.

So... if my post seems a bit strange or clumsy... don't be surprised!
It's due to my inexperience!

But I thought this would be the best place to share my worries.
It seems like this might be the only place where I can get answers to my questions, or at least not feel alone in not having answers!

Four years ago, at age 23, I had my first and only generalized tonic-clonic seizure in my sleep.
I had no family history, nor any clear trigger like sleep deprivation.

Since that day, I've been taking my prescribed anti-seizure medication.
Although recently, my dose has been gradually reduced under my doctor's supervision.

Even though I've read many articles and done a lot of research, some doubts and fears still linger in my mind.

Question 1:
Is there anyone here who only had one seizure, but years later, after stopping medication, had another seizure?

Question 2:
Could intense symptoms like unbearable headache and dizziness that I experience during sudden stressful situations, after sleepless nights, or on days I've had coffee, actually be ""near-seizure"" states that are only prevented from turning into full seizures because of the medication?

Question 3:
Even though I only had one seizure, my EEG two days later still showed unusual brain activity.
Does this mean I actually have an epilepsy diagnosis?
To be honest, so far no one has given my experience a specific name.

Question 4:
In newer research, I've read that there doesn't necessarily have to be an immediate, specific trigger (like sleep deprivation or acute stress).
Sometimes chronic stress and long-term sleep deprivation alone can be the underlying cause.
Is this true?

Question 5:
Is it possible that one day, even while on medication, during intense stress or after several consecutive days of sleep deprivation, I could have another seizure?

Lately, I've been going to sleep with a lot of stress and constantly worry that I might seize again in my sleep.
I used to eagerly look forward to the day I could stop my medication.
But now — especially with my highly anxious personality — I'm really scared.

I'm afraid that if I stop the medication and the seizure returns, I won't be able to control it anymore.
I'm worried for myself, and for my mom, whose worries will multiply.

From the bottom of my heart, thank you for taking the time to read this.

1pkrtr1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pkrtr1,"STUB SHOTS // DECEMBER 11, 2025 — FLORIDA SUES COFFEE FOR BEING TOO WOKE","**FLORIDA SUES COFFEE FOR BEING TOO WOKE**

*December 11, 2025 — 12:32 PM ET*

In an act of caffeinated courage, Florida’s Attorney General has sued Starbucks — not for burning coffee, but for reverse discrimination. Apparently, the frappuccino overlords tried hiring people *on purpose*, and that crossed a line.

According to the lawsuit, Starbucks didn’t just dabble in diversity. They put racial equity in a cup, steamed it, and tied executive bonuses to it. Somewhere in Seattle, a VP of foam strategy is panicking.

AG James Uthmeier claims Starbucks “made DEI more than a slogan.” Translation: they did exactly what every LinkedIn post said they should — but forgot to check with Tallahassee first. Now, Florida wants $10,000 per person who felt left out of the iced matcha mentorship club.

The logic? If your resume was too pale, your job chances were stale. Somewhere, a barista who spells “Mike” as “Myke” is weeping into a caramel drizzle.

Let’s be clear: Starbucks once pledged to have 40% of retail roles filled by people of color. Florida says that’s racial profiling with a green apron.

And the worst part? They *tied it to bonuses*. Imagine a world where your paycheck depends on justice. It’s madness. Or socialism. Or whatever word cable news is screaming this week.

Starbucks responded with the corporate equivalent of a shrug: “We’re inclusive.” Translation: please don’t subpoena our holiday cups.

This isn’t a lawsuit. It’s an audition for the 2026 midterms.

**THE YEAR MEN GOT CLOCKED BY CODE**

*December 11, 2025 — 9:19 AM ET*

Time magazine didn’t announce a **Person** of the Year in 2025.  
They announced a **concept.** A tech abstraction. A cluster of algorithms.

The “Architects of AI.”

Let that sink in.

In a world where actual *people* — flesh, bone, blood — moved history, Time slapped the crown on a ***collective idea*** and called it a *person*.

Bullshit.

*“When a publication renames a concept “Person of the Year,” it’s already given up on relevance.” — Stub Froth*

This isn’t innovation recognition. It’s an excuse. An admission that they’ve washed their hands of real human achievement. Because if you honestly thought the most consequential “person” in America in 2025 was a bunch of programmers and executives behind code, then you never cared about individuals — you cared about marketing copy.

Let’s rehearse the actual *people* they passed over:

* A president who *stopped wars* and reshaped global posture — again.
* A reformer who walked into the deepest swamp in existence to cut waste, got swarmed, and walked away burned but not irrelevant.
* Voices that moved movements, cracked institutions, and faced real backlash.
* Actual men with names, faces, families, consequences.

But Time?  
Time said: **“Architecture” is more consequential than the architects.**

Christ.

*“When a magazine hired to chronicle human impact worships abstraction over actual humans, its own obituary reads itself.” — Stub Froth*

Maybe Time thinks people don’t matter anymore. Maybe they believe that lines of code deserve the same narrative weight as a person who shaped life, death, policy, conflict, culture, consequence. Maybe the next step is “Person of the Decade: The Algorithm.”

Here’s the truth: AI didn’t *happen* because the Architects built it. AI *happened* because the world wanted it, funded it, adopted it, and argued about it. The *real* Person of the Year should be someone who lived with consequences — not someone whose product just got too big to ignore.

And yes — AI transformed headlines in 2025.  
But headlines don’t fire rockets, stop wars, rescue economies, or see consequences on the ground. **People do.**

Time didn’t honor impact. It honored buzz. It crowned motion instead of meaning.

*— Stub Froth*

So congratulations, Time Magazine.  
You’ve officially declared that concepts are more consequential than *characters.*

That’s not choice.  
That’s surrender.

You can name “architects” all you want.  
But you just told billions of men — and billions of people shaped by real events — they weren’t people enough to matter.

And that — more than any robot — is the real travesty.

**THE GAME COACHES LOST**

*December 11, 2025 — 8:34 AM ET*

Sherrone Moore was on top of the world — the head coach of Michigan football, living the dream: a $5.5 million base salary, national title pedigree, and a program as blue‑blood as it gets. And then, in a single day, he went from sideline strategist to county jail inmate. Fired for an inappropriate relationship with a staffer… and booked within hours. That’s not just a fall — that’s a **career implosion executed in real time**.

Let’s be blunt: millions of Americans watch football every Saturday not because they care about bureaucratic policy, but because it’s one of the last arenas where merit still seemed to matter. Coaches get hired on pedigree, they get fired on results — that’s sport. But this wasn’t on‑field performance. This was personal conduct. And it didn’t happen in private either; it happened in the kind of way that forces law enforcement into the narrative. That’s not “oops,” that’s a career ending in a single afternoon.

*“When your personal life becomes a headline before your apology can go public, you’ve already lost the narrative.” – Stub Froth*

The athletic department tried to play it clean: vague official statement, no names, no details, “maintaining integrity of the investigation.” But the optics of coaching a top‑tier team one minute and being downtown in cuffs the next? That’s an American tragedy in slow motion. And the university didn’t just cut bait — they terminated him *for cause* so they won’t have to buy him out. That’s a corporate execution, not a simple firing.

Moore’s coaching story was one of relentless climb: walk‑on player to graduate assistant, climbing the ranks under Jim Harbaugh, taking over an elite roster, navigating suspensions and scandals before. Yet even that resilience couldn’t save him from **what his choices on the clock did off the clock**. When a coach deletes a 52‑message text thread with a staffer involved in another controversy and then ends up in cuffs… you don’t just lose trust — you lose institutional patience.

*“You can climb the ladder on talent, but you get fired on conduct.” – Stub Froth*

And make no mistake: this ripples. This isn’t just locker room gossip anymore. It’s a leadership vacuum at the end of a fractured coaching carousel. Michigan has now cycled through three head coaches in four years. The Wolverines have a Citrus Bowl looming. A high‑profile program that just moments ago was national elite feels like a flipping freight train without tracks.

There’s no silver lining in a story like this — only wreckage. The NCAA sanctions. The deletions. The jail booking. The abrupt firing. The program’s instability. Michigan’s narrative went from championship contender to national cautionary tale in the space of 24 hours.

*“If you lead a team but can’t lead your own conduct, you’re coaching everyone else’s standards — not your own.” – Stub Froth*

This wasn’t a scandal off the field, whispered in locker rooms and hushed in hallways. This was front‑page behavior that dragged the legal system into the sport’s temple. And it raises a brutal question: in a culture that lionizes success and forgives talent, where do we draw the line between performance and responsibility?

Sherrone Moore had a career most coaches would kill for. And in an instant, he *lost* it — not on fourth down, not because of X’s and O’s, *but because he forgot the first rule of leadership: integrity doesn’t take a day off.*

1pkrt7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/barrysbootcamp/comments/1pkrt7q/my_morning_routine_allows_me_to_get_to_early/,My morning routine - allows me to get to early classes,"There have been recent posts on this sub about bedtimes / morning routines / making it to early AM classes. Over the past year I transitioned to an early morning person, I absolutely love getting after it before the world is awake. Even on weekends!! The only times I’ve awoken after sunrise this year, besides for a few sick days, was the morning after a brutal eighteen hour day hike of Mt. Whitney. It felt amazing waking up at 10am that day.

Anyways - below is my morning routine. I hope it helps, and I welcome any/all feedback. 

9:30pm - asleep. Later than normal. I swim Thursday nights until 8pm, then grocery store, shower, dinner. Took too long yesterday

3:11am - awake, beat my alarm 

3:15-3:31 light sleep / look at phone / track Christmas presents on UPS /FedEx (both carriers are crushing it this season)

3:31 - feet on floor in slippers, turn off heated blanket, turn on space heater

3:32 - bathroom for #1 and #2 / look at reddit and respond to someone who asked if \[solidcore\] is effective (check my comment I’m somewhat proud of it).

3:43 - check peloton app, to see what “hike” class my dad did (30min Rebecca Kennedy Stevie Nicks hike). Proud of him. He and my mom are prepping for a South America hiking trip

3:45 - off toilet (wow reddit is a time suck. I didn’t even scroll instagram)

3:46 - look at face in mirror to see if it’s puffy. It’s a little puffy, I had a lot of salt yesterday. I’ll be intentional with hydration this AM 

3:47 - drink water from bathroom sink 

3:48 - contacts in (I need to order more, I’ll do it in new year when insurance re-ups. Somehow, despite wearing dailies, I only have like ten contacts left for the year ugh….)

3:49 - open laptop, check calendar, amazing a meeting was cancelled

3:51 - put Apple Watch on charger (I sleep with it on), sit inches from space heater and have a moment of zen

3:52 - review my Apple Health sleep score. Not good… not enough REM. 

3:53-4:03- zen mode in front of space heater. Review World News Headlines and practice mindfulness (jk I scrolled instagram. I get so many Instagram ads. 

Should I buy a turtleneck? Also got some 60minutes content about their episode with Dr Peter Attia on longevity. I like him!)

4:03 - okay I’m going from sitting in front of space heater to laying in front of space heater. This can be dangerous, I’ve fallen asleep doing this in the past. Set phone timer for 12min just in case 

4:16 okay I’m UP. No longer lying on bedroom floor in  front of space heater. Instagram gave me soo many ads for turtlenecks and random content about fitness studio leaving ClassPass. I just turned on the song TitForTat by Tate McRae because my little sister got broken up with recently and said she’s been listening to this song on repeat. I stand with you sister!!! This song slaps 

4:17 remember I need to get pants from my tailor. Should I do that today?

4:20 - downstairs, have glass of water, turn on car so it gets TOASTY

4:22 - ugh it’s freezing outside. Car is on. 

4:23 - in front of Nespresso machine. Put 32ml of core power vanilla protein shake into mug (lower cal than skim milk, tastes better), then put mug on machine and click button. Coffee starts brewing. I’m so excited to have this cup of coffee. 

4:25 - back upstairs

4:27 - get completely naked. Pee. Weigh myself. I’m okay with the number on scale.

4:28 - put on gym clothes I picked out last night 

4:30 - put on sweats and sweatshirt and down vest and winter cap

4:33 - space heater off and Apple Watch on

4:33 - ugh my phone connected via Bluetooth to my car and I hear my car playing TIT FOR TAT, I hope my neighbors didn’t hear…. I’m worried

4:34-4:36- brush teeth 

4:36 - put Vaseline on lips. Leave bedroom

4:37 - back in front of Nespresso machine. Have glass of water first. Hydrate before you caffeinate 

4:38 - fist sip off coffee. YUM. add 18ml more of core power and microwave coffee for 17 sec

4:39 slippers off, shoes on

4:40 out of house. Lock front door

4:40 double check to make sure door is locked

4:41 in car it’s so toasty 

4:42 reconnect phone to car Bluetooth once down block. Blasting TITFORTAT, blasting heat, and driving to gym, drinking coffee 

4:50 - last sip of coffee + this drive is super foggy today 

4:55 - pulling into gym parking lot. I’m fourth car here. Why is TITFORTAT stuck in my head? Also are my neighbors mad at me? Time to workout to work these thoughts out of my head

4:57 - inside gym, yap with front desk girl. What should I get her for Christmas? Something more personal than a Starbucks gift card. Any ideas?

4:58- in locker room, pee

4:59 - WORKOUT. LETS GO

Reviewing this timeline, there’s definitely opportunity for me to expedite and remove wasted time. My “layover” time in the bathroom and in front of space heater was too much. I could have stretched while in front of heater, but instead I scrolled. When my instagram algorithm isn’t showing me ads for turtlenecks it’s showing my influencers who do cold plunges and journal from 3-5am. I’m not there (yet!!) 

I had a supply chain professor in college who encouraged us to do this exercise (log, minute by minute, our morning routine.) I prob skipped that assignment and made it all up, sorry Professor Tag, take this as my assignment.

So here’s a no-nonsense “do this / don’t do that” list if you’re sending digital gift cards.

✅ DOs

**1) Do buy from legit sources.**  
Brand website, well-known voucher platforms, or your bank’s rewards/instant voucher portal. If a site feels shady, it usually is.

**2) Do double-check the recipient’s details.**  
Email typo = voucher sent into the void.  
If you’re sending via phone number, confirm the last 2 digits *before* hitting pay.

**3) Do pick the brand that matches their life.**  
Foodie? Zomato/Swiggy.  
Fashion? Westside/Myntra.  
Practical? Amazon/Flipkart.  
If you’re unsure, go universal.

**4) Do schedule it (if the platform allows).**  
This is a lifesaver for midnight birthdays or “I’m going to forget in 3 days” moments.

**5) Do add a message that makes it feel personal.**  
Even one line helps:  
“Coffee on me after your rough week” > “Happy Birthday.”

**6) Do check validity + redemption terms.**  
Especially for travel, experiences, and some offline-only vouchers. A gift card with a 30-day expiry is basically a ticking bomb.

**7) Do keep proof of purchase.**  
Screenshot/receipt/email. If anything goes wrong, this saves you.

**8) Do set a “safe amount” if you’re unsure.**  
If you don’t know what to gift, ₹500–₹1000 is usually the sweet spot: thoughtful, not awkward.

# ❌ DON’Ts

**1) Don’t buy “too good to be true” discounted codes.**  
If someone’s selling a ₹1000 voucher for ₹400 on a random page… that’s not a deal, that’s a future headache.

**2) Don’t send gift cards on public Wi-Fi.**  
Not trying to be dramatic, but payments + public networks = unnecessary risk.

**3) Don’t assume all gift cards are instant.**  
Some take time to process (especially during sales/festivals). If it’s urgent, buy earlier.

**4) Don’t ignore region/platform restrictions.**  
Some vouchers work only on the website, some only in the app, some only in India, etc. Check before gifting.

**5) Don’t forward the code in the same message as the greeting.**  
If your WhatsApp/Email is ever accessed, you’ve basically gifted *someone else*.  
Better: send the greeting + send the code separately, or use the platform’s direct delivery.

**6) Don’t gift a brand they’ve never used (unless it’s universal).**  
Sounds obvious, but people still do this, and then the voucher just… sits.

**7) Don’t forget the “what if it fails” plan.**  
If they can’t redeem it, you should know how to contact support or raise a ticket.

# My personal rule of thumb

If I’m confident about the brand, I gift that specific voucher.  
If I’m not confident, I go universal (Amazon/Flipkart-type) from a reliable platform (I’ve used GyFTR/Woohoo/MyHubbleMoney for this, depending on the occasion and availability—neutral mention, not an ad).",1,1765545651.0,u_TechnicalStruggle632,0,1.0,False

I’ve been experimenting with a vertical AI agent for online shopping called **Maya Lae** \- she's a “digital human” that helps you choose products like mattresses, air purifiers, home goods, outdoor or sports equipment, etc.

Maya asks follow-up questions (budget, constraints, use-case), compares specs/prices/warranties across retailers, and narrows things down to a few options *with reasoning* (pros/cons, tradeoffs). She's meant to be like a really well trained sales rep at a store, only yours 24/7 online.

I’m obviously biased because I’m building her - so I’d love **brutal, practical feedback** from this sub:

1. Would you ever use an AI agent for shopping *instead* of search/marketplaces? Why / why not?

I’ve been experimenting with a vertical AI agent for online shopping called **Maya Lae** \- she's a “digital human” that helps you choose products like mattresses, air purifiers, home goods, outdoor or sports equipment, etc.

Maya asks follow-up questions (budget, constraints, use-case), compares specs/prices/warranties across retailers, and narrows things down to a few options *with reasoning* (pros/cons, tradeoffs). She's meant to be like a really well trained sales rep at a store, only yours 24/7 online.

I’m obviously biased because I’m building her - so I’d love **brutal, practical feedback** from this sub:

1. Would you ever use an AI agent for shopping *instead* of search/marketplaces? Why / why not?
2. Which product categories would make this actually useful? (High consideration? Everyday items?)

Instead, everyone seems to be telling us how very lucky we are, like we somehow cheated at parenthood. My lizard brain is panicking thinking something is wrong or abnormal with my son.

He feeds really well and sleeps immediately after feeding. He wakes up and grumbles, usually for one of two things - food or dirty nappy. Fix the issue and he is happy again. He’s as transactional and efficient as a very small, bald project manager.

He will lie there awake in his bassinet without contact, just watching the lights or the toys we hung above him. His startle reflex is working, but he won’t cry or wake up to noise like coughs or doors slamming. I can vacuum around him, play music loud in the car, take him out round the shops and he either sleeps or just calmly watches what is going on. He doesn’t cry just to be held, but I can soothe him by holding him and shushing him if I need to e.g. taking a bit of time to prepare his feed or get to the changing table. He wakes up twice through the night at 2am and 5am. Issue resolved. Down for sleep again.

The only time he really, really cries is when we change his clothes. Then he screams like a pterodactyl. Sleeves are his nemesis.

Meanwhile, I’m the one startling at every noise wondering if this is the moment it will all start freewheeling downhill. Am I lucky? Is this actually normal and we have all been tricked into thinking babies are hellspawn? Is my baby broken? Or is it me?",10,1765545186.0,newborns,13,1.0,False

I wanted something to reduce my safety anxiety and that creepiness not actual crimes (that is almost same everywhere). Therefore I started building a product called **Safe or Not**

I have a 6800xt, paired with a I7-13k. Love it, was looking to having a gaming pc for years. Bought it second hand, minus the gpu, it is also second hand but from another vendor.

Now, what happens with my gpu? It worked great until one day I went to boot up the pc and the display was like 720p or something, super blurry and laggy. Went online and saw it could be the drivers. I tried to fix it multiple times, and ended up having to factory reset the pc. Reseated fine everything worked, installed games and Adrenalin software, performed once again crazy well. Some time passed, same problem. Once again went online Reddit, even made a similar post to this, no solution. So I went ahead and just reset the pc again.

This third time I decided no to install Adrenalin, only drivers. And man it has been workin marvelously. Although, stupidly, I saw a post saying to just turn off automatic updates and it would work. So I did, I installed the software (because I really like the simplicity to just have software to make clips and toggle performance indicators and what not), run smoothly for a few weeks until yesterday. Was playing euro truck, all fine and well, and as a dedicated sim truck driver, went to the bathroom with a coffee and cigarette, only to return 20 minutes later and the screens were all black. Tried to “wake” the pc to no avail. So I had to restart it in the power button, so I did. And bam, the 720p started again.

I uninstalled Radeon Adrenalin, messed around in options and in device manager to enable the gpu (for some reason it stops being enabled after these episodes). Restarted and we were back to those crisp 1440p and no apparent lag. Until I jumped back in the truck, was driving around and noticed 50fps on the steam performance reader, whereas it usually says 160-170. And I realized I haven’t fixed a thing. Went to get the driver only install from the internet: error 195, every time (same one when I tried to reinstall the drivers to fix the 720p problem).

Is my gpu dying? What can I do? I really can’t begin to think on buying a gpu now. I wanted to keep up for team red, but dam the software is so much worse and I see so many complaints about it.

I hope this doesn’t get lost in the posts, um really at a loss right here. Btw, thank you for the attention and apologies for the long and not so well written post.

I nodded and smiled and felt the weight of failure before I had even begun.
I hate exercise. Not in a casual way. In a deep, lifelong aversion that has defeated every attempt at fitness routines. Gyms make me self conscious. Running destroys my knees. Swimming requires facilities I do not have access to. Every previous attempt at getting healthy had ended in guilt and resignation.
But then my neighbor started commuting on an electric bike. He was not an athlete. Not young. Not someone I would have associated with cycling. Yet every morning I saw him leave on this bike, arriving home looking energized rather than exhausted. When I asked about it, he explained the electric assist made it manageable for his fitness level. You still pedal, still exercise, but the motor helps when you need it.
I researched obsessively before buying. How far could they go. How much did they weigh. Could someone out of shape actually use one. The reviews were encouraging. People like me, people who had failed at traditional exercise, were finding success with electric bikes.
Three months in, I have lost fifteen pounds without really trying. My commute is now my exercise, something that happens naturally rather than requiring separate willpower. My blood pressure has improved. More surprisingly, my mood has improved. The morning ride wakes me up better than coffee. The evening ride helps me decompress from work stress.

I (25F) got my routine blood work done around October 2024 and my A1C was 5.8! My doctor didn’t seem too concerned since I was just over the threshold for prediabetes. I’ve been a bit of a hypochondriac due to family history. I was really panicked because diabetes runs in my family and my dad passed away from multiple health complications including diabetes. I watched him suffer through terrible health issues including kidney failure (he was on dialysis),a heart attack, and at some point needing to take skin graphs from his thigh for his calves (I don’t know the details of this to this day as I was so young when this happened),taking a lot of medications, high BP, etc. Long story short, when I found out about being prediabetic I just thought of my dad’s health struggles and spiraled. 


I have always been an active person but from Fall 2023 - Fall 2024 I stopped taking care of myself the way I should’ve. I was finishing up college(I was very stressed), drinking more, and eating out more often. I’m about 5’2 and my weight went from 133 to 147 lbs during this time. I was aware I had let myself go a little bit but didn’t expect a prediabetes diagnosis. I slowly began to make changes to my diet like cutting out rice, pasta, energy drinks, sugary creamers, etc. I definitely still treated myself in this last year but focused on increased fiber so lots of veggies and low sugar fruit like apples, blueberries, and oranges.(TMI but this has had everything FLOWIN) I stopped drinking sugary coffee all together and made sure I ate something before consuming coffee(I either drink it black, or add a bit of half and half with stevia) Lots of eggs, nuts, kale, spinach, beef sticks as a snack,tea,and zero/low sugar protein bars whenever I really wanted something sweet. I still ate out (especially the last couple months because of birthdays/holidays) and had desserts too. I think watching my portions and not binging on high carb snacks all the time really helped too lol. For a couple months I was also doing OMAD but I’m not implementing that as much now since I work out kinda hard lol and I need more fuel. I cut back on alcohol quite a bit too and in the last 5 months I’ve drank about 3 times and limited myself to a couple drinks. 

I’ve slacked off in the gym for the past few weeks but most of the time I’m pretty active. I try to go to the gym at least 3-4 times a week and during the rest of the week I’ll do at home yoga, walk a couple miles, or run. My gym routine consists of 20 mins on the bike, weight training, and 10-15 minutes on the stair master. In a year I have gone from 147 to 120-122 range so I’ve lost about 25 lbs!!! I don’t think I’ve been at that weight since I was like 14/15 but this isn’t just about weight..of course the weight loss came with the diet changes. I truly think a lot of this was diet and I’m so happy I did it. I want to continue to focus on these better habits as this wasn’t just to lower my A1C but a lifestyle change I will maintain for years to come. I know I’m young(ish) and a lot of people my age take their health for granted but this is the time to implement good habits so that you can avoid health issues down the line.

1pkr8nd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amazontly/comments/1pkr8nd/digital_kitchen_scale_vs_food_scale_which_to/,Digital kitchen scale vs food scale: which to choose?,"You've probably heard people use ""digital kitchen scale"" and ""food scale"" like they're two different things. Here's the truth: they're basically the same device. Both are designed to weigh ingredients and food items in your kitchen. The confusion comes from how people name them, but they serve the same purpose.

A digital kitchen scale measures ingredients by weight instead of volume. Whether you call it a kitchen scale or food scale doesn't really matter. What matters is getting one that works well for your needs.

## Why Weight Matters More Than Volume

Measuring by weight gives you way better accuracy than using cups and spoons. A cup of flour can vary by 20-30 grams depending on how you scoop it. That might not sound like much, but it can mess up your recipes, especially when you're baking.

Most digital scales measure in both grams and ounces, which makes following any recipe easier. You can switch between units with a button press.

## What Makes a Good Scale

When you're shopping for one, look for these features:

**Accuracy** - The scale should measure down to at least 1 gram. Some go even smaller for things like coffee or spices.

**Capacity** - Most scales handle up to 5-11 pounds, which works for regular cooking. If you meal prep or bake in large batches, go higher.

**Tare function** - This lets you zero out the weight of your bowl or container. You can add ingredients one by one without doing math.

**Easy-to-read display** - A backlit screen helps when your kitchen lighting isn't great.

**Flat surface** - A smooth weighing platform is easier to clean than one with lots of grooves.

## Food Scale vs Kitchen Scale: Any Real Difference?

Some people use ""food scale"" when they're counting calories or doing portion control. They use ""kitchen scale"" when talking about cooking and baking. But the device itself? Same thing.

You might see some scales marketed specifically for dieting or meal prep. These sometimes include nutrition calculators or memory functions. Standard kitchen scales usually just weigh things, which is all most people need.

## Getting the Right One

Your choice depends on what you'll use it for most. If you're serious about baking, weighing ingredients makes a huge difference in consistency. If you're watching portions or tracking macros, a scale helps you stay accurate instead of guessing.

You can find quality options that won't break the bank. Check out different models at **[this collection of digital kitchen scales](https://athomewave.com/digital-kitchen-scale)** to see what features matter to you.

## Bottom Line

Don't stress about whether you need a ""digital kitchen scale"" or a ""food scale."" They're the same tool with different names. Focus on finding one with the features you'll actually use: good accuracy, the right weight capacity, and a tare function at minimum.

A decent scale lasts for years and makes cooking way less frustrating. No more wondering if you added too much or too little. You'll know exactly what's going into your food.

1pkr8n6,https://www.reddit.com/r/depechemode/comments/1pkr8n6/best_dm_book_for_nerdy_fan/,best DM book for nerdy fan,"my partner is a pretty diehard DM fan, who’s even introduced me to the band few years back when we started dating and they are now definitely one of my favorites. i’ve recently learnt that DM books exist and thought it’d be an awesome gift idea for christmas, as he loves books and has a little collection going of geeky/niche books on our coffee table (vintage volvo/saab books, VW, etc). he is hugely into their early on synths especially, and is always telling me factoids about the history of the band or their instrumentals, but the main thing for him is the synths.

i’m looking for one that would be a good first book for a DM fan like him, where i guess i’d say is the most geeked out and goes into synth details in depth. i’ve read that the “DM FAQ: all that’s left to know about the worlds finest synth-pop band” goes into pretty well detail about their early on synths and even talks about kraftwerk as well and how they’ve influenced DM, which kraftwerk is another one of his all time favorites and talks about frequently how influential they were, even to DM, so i was thinking that could be the right book, but it seems it’s more of a magazine rather than actual book- but if it’s genuinely worth it i’d have no issue getting it.

i also seen a lot of recommendations for Stripped as well, and read that it also has good detail regarding the synths, but i also saw some distaste for the book and that people describe it as more of a “gossip” (?) book and that there is better out there. i have also considered Monument but i am not 100% sure if it has the type of content in it, or at least as much as the other books, when talking about their synths and such.

if there is other DM books out there anyone can recommend with the criteria i’m looking for please let me know, basically just looking for the most geeky DM book possible for synth loving nerds like my bf. thanks!

**Do atheists believe that being demeaning and insulting will get them somewhere? Level the playing field to see it:**

**It's in two words, then:**

* **demeaning.** <definition> 1. *cause someone to lose their dignity*
* **insult(ing).** <definition> 1. *speak or treat with disrespect.*

Maybe the answer to both your question and mine then - - *is the same.*

Why?

Me?

* IF: I speak or treat with high regard (means respect) God, and who he is, and what he says; then, I’m going to “accept as true” who he is. I’ll just naturally hear him and obey him. It’s like going to the Shopping Mall in my town then.
   * I highly esteem it. It’s like the highlight of my town, to go to the mall. I’m never disappointed. It’s a great place to go have coffee and just take a break.
      * SO, I speak well of the Shopping Mall in my town. Anytime, some topic come up about the Mall, I’m glad to hear it.
      * BUT:
   * If somebody else: Went to the Mall and someone slashed their tires or broke into their car, and stole all their CHristmas presents, or one of the 150+ stores “cheated” them out of by selling them derelict merchandise; that, even it said “Return with 60 days - FULL REFUND” and they returned it in 3 days - GOT NO REFUND.
      * They are going to “lowly esteem” the Shopping Mall in my town. Anytime someone brings up the mall in my town, the first thing enters into their head how it cost $600.00 to get all the tires replaced, and how the Mall didn’t do anything. Wouldn’t even peruse the security cameras.
* **SO, look at the difference:**
   * IF: I - in front of this person, started to speak well of the Shopping Mall, the first thing that’s going to happen is, this person, who got their tires slashed, is they will feel *offended.* It will *“cause them to lose their dignity.” When all they have is “disrespect” or “lowly esteem” the Shopping Mall.*
      * And Me? Their comments? Will also “cause me to lose my dignity” - be demeaning. Make my effort going to the mall to just relax and enjoy the coffee worthless to do. Threw a pile of slashed tires on top of a $3.50 cup of coffee; that, would take over 200 trips getting coffee to equate to the value of tires, and I don’t think I ever could go to the mall that many times, even in my lifetime. So, it’s insulting.

**Again, I believe God. He says:** ***It’s a decree just how things are to be in his earth he made himself:***

* *“Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God” - Jesus Christ. The Word of God. (Bible. Matthew 4:4)*
   * He tells everybody to do this over the whole earth. So, I do it.
   * But if an atheist, who says “*there is no God or gods”*
      * This causes me to lose my dignity. Has no respect for me looking unto him at all. Treats who I look unto with no respect. Lowly esteems him. Meets the definition of “demeaning and insulting.”
   * Just as well me. Highly esteeming him for who he is; that, an atheist hear it. Will cause them to lose their dignity - feel insulted; feel attacked and offended. Just by what I’m doing, living by every word proceeds out of God’s mouth, is demeaning and insulting, for no other reason than just choosing to do what he says.
* When an atheist doesn’t. And the atheist feels, I’m deliberately, with intent - purposefully trying to demean and insult them, when I could care less. He told me to look unto him. It’s in none else. There is no “***not look unto him***.” There’s no room in me to consider anybody else, just do what he says. There is none else.
   * And people that don’t do anything he says, I know him enough, he will do with them what he says he will do. Call them before him to give an account. Not going to call them before me to do it. I’m a filthy pervert; not bragging. That’s just what I did.
   * But everytime I confirm I just accept him as true, and an atheist has to listen to it, it’s demeaning and insulting - even there is no intent.  ",1,1765544225.0,ScriptureLife,0,1.0,False

The [Donald Trump](https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/politics/donald-trump) administration is forming a global alliance to challenge China's dominance in critical minerals and emerging technologies.  
The coalition was officially launched with the signing of the Pax Silica Declaration today. It includes [Singapore](https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/world/singapore), [Australia](https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/world/australia), Japan, South Korea, and Israel as founding members.  
The move comes as a response to China's massive investments in its rare earth minerals and tech sectors.

# Coalition aims to address critical mineral access deficits

The Pax Silica Declaration is a strategic response to China's near-monopoly in rare earths, minerals vital for civilian and military purposes.  
The Trump administration sees this as a major threat due to China's export restrictions aimed at countering US tariffs on Chinese imports.  
The declaration also highlights concerns over China's heavy investments in [AI](https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/science/artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning) and quantum computing, which could give it an upper hand in the 21st-century economy.

# Coalition expansion and global cooperation

The Trump administration hopes to expand the coalition beyond the initial five countries, bringing in more allies with mineral, technological, and manufacturing resources.  
The signing of the declaration will kick off a one-day Pax Silica Summit with officials from the European Union, [Canada](https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/world/canada), Netherlands, and United Arab Emirates.  
Discussions will focus on collaboration in advanced manufacturing, mineral refining, and logistics.

# Coalition's vision for the future

The coalition envisions a future where it could be as influential in the AI age as G7 was in the industrial age.  
It aims to cooperate on export controls, foreign investment screening, and anti-dumping measures.  
The ultimate goal is to secure key points in the global supply chain system and counter China's Belt and Road Initiative which seeks to boost its export-led model by acquiring ports, highways, and transport corridors.

The Trump administration is forming a coalition to counter China’s dominant control of critical minerals and emerging power as a center of AI and other tech sectors.

The administration plans to launch the coalition of partners with the signing Friday of the Pax Silica Declaration, uniting Singapore, Australia, Japan, South Korea and Israel in a collaboration intended to address deficits in critical mineral access edging out China’s massive investment in its critical minerals and tech sector. The administration is actively looking to enlist other countries to join the group.

The declaration — a statement of common principles — paves the way for joint research and development, manufacturing and infrastructure development intended to to rival China’s Belt and Road infrastructure initiative, Under Secretary for Economic Affairs Jacob Helberg told POLITICO.

The initiative underscores the degree to which the Trump administration considers China’s near monopoly in rare earths – minerals that are critical to civilian and military applications – and dominance of other parts of the global supply chain, as a significant threat.

Beijing has wielded its dominance of the sector[ ](https://x.com/MOFCOM_China/status/1910314479323377994)[through export restrictions](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/national-security-daily/2025/06/11/trade-deals-cant-stop-chinas-rare-earth-edge-00400475) intended to hit back against the Trump administration’s aggressive tariff policy on Chinese imports.

The declaration also reflects U.S. concern about China’s massive investment in artificial intelligence and quantum computing that could give it a competitive edge in the 21st century economy.

“It’s an industrial policy for an economic security coalition and it’s a game changer because there is no grouping today where we can get together to talk about the AI economy and how we compete with China in AI,” Helberg said. “By aligning our economic security approaches, we can start to have cohesion to basically block China’s Belt and Road Initiative — which is really designed to magnify its export-led model — by denying China the ability to buy ports, major highways, transportation and logistics corridors.”

Helberg said that the Trump administration aims to expand the coalition from the initial five countries that sign the declaration to include more allies and partners with mineral, technological and manufacturing resources.

The signing of the declaration kicks off the administration’s one-day Pax Silica Summit, which will include officials from the European Union, Canada, the Netherlands and the United Arab Emirates. The summit will feature discussions about cooperation in areas such as advanced manufacturing, mineral refining and logistics.

“This grouping of countries will be to the AI age what the G7 was to the industrial age,” Helberg said. “It commits us to a process by which we’re going to cooperate on aligning our export controls, screening of foreign investments, addressing anti-dumping but with a very proactive agenda on securing choke points in the global supply chain system.”

STILLWATER, Okla., Dec. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- USA Rare Earth, Inc. (Nasdaq: USAR) (USAR or the Company) today announced a significant acceleration of the commercialization timeline for its Round Top heavy rare earth deposit in Texas. The Company now plans to begin commercial production in late 2028, two years earlier than previously anticipated. Round Top is the United States’ richest known deposit of heavy rare earth elements, gallium, and beryllium, and is a cornerstone of USAR’s integrated mine-to-magnet value chain. That value chain also includes a 310,000 sq ft. magnet manufacturing facility in Stillwater, Oklahoma, which is expected to be the largest metal-and-alloy-making and strip-casting capability outside of China, and a processing and separation laboratory in Wheat Ridge, Colorado.

“We’re challenging ourselves to innovate and pursue creative solutions that accelerate our timeline for securing, reshoring, and growing the U.S. rare earth value chain,” said Barbara Humpton, Chief Executive Officer of USA Rare Earth. “Beginning commercial production at Round Top two years earlier than anticipated would be an exciting milestone made possible by the team’s technical capabilities, process knowledge, and ingenuity. As global demand for rare earth magnets continues to rise and geopolitical risks escalate, accelerating domestic production is essential for securing the long-term competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing.”

USAR has accelerated the planned commercialization timeline for Round Top because it expects to begin operating its Hydromet demonstration facility in Colorado early in 2026, based on the promising results of its recent and ongoing SX piloting. The Hydromet facility will operate five solvent-extraction (SX) circuits continuously, for 2,000 to 4,000 hours, to generate the operational data required to proceed with commercial plant design. These circuits will target heavy rare earth elements, particularly dysprosium (Dy) and terbium (Tb), which are essential for high-performance permanent magnets, while also extracting additional critical minerals including hafnium and zirconium.

This novel parallel-process approach is expected to save the Company tens of millions of dollars, while enabling USAR to complete its definitive feasibility study (DFS) by early 2027. Earlier completion of the DFS would allow USAR to move into commercial production at Round Top by late 2028.

Accelerating these milestones allows USAR to extract value from the Round Top deposit sooner and underscores its disciplined execution, technical leadership, and commitment to building a resilient, fully integrated U.S. rare earth supply chain.

# How NioCorp Is Quietly Building the Most Advanced Critical Minerals Vertical Integration Chain in the U.S.

While other U.S. rare earth players are still validating their hydrometallurgical flowsheets, **NioCorp already completed that work in the 2022 Feasibility Study**, backed by one of the few solvent-extraction (SX) teams in North America with full commercial experience (ex-Molycorp → now MP Materials). Elk Creek doesn’t require an unproven heavy-rare-earth separation circuit. Instead, NioCorp uses a **two-stage process**:  
**(1)** a new Heat/Calcination **extraction step** optimized for niobium, scandium, and rare earth liberation from Elk Creek’s unique ore chemistry; and  
**(2)** **traditional, extensively validated SX circuits** modeled on proven commercial units already in use globally.  
This combination gives NioCorp one of the **lowest technical scale-up risks in the sector**, because their hydromet process is not hypothetical – it’s already been engineered, tested, and costed!!

IMHO\~  Validated through independent testing, allowing NioCorp to upgrade feed solutions, reduce impurity loading, and sharpen separation efficiency before the SX stage – effectively giving them tighter control of reagent consumption, phase equilibrium, and product purity. Instead of requiring 5 parallel SX circuits running for 4,000 hours like the Round Top demonstration plant, NioCorp’s chemistry works through **simpler, conventional SX trains** for Nd/Pr, Dy, Tb, niobium, and scandium — exactly the technology the team has been running since the Molycorp days. \*\*\*\***This team already proved they can bring a U.S. extraction plant online and produce commercial-grade rare earth oxides at scale; the expertise is already built-in!!**

Where NioCorp distinguishes itself even further is the **vertical integration** emerging around its seven critical minerals. The newly formed **NAMA (North American Metals & Alloys)** is the vehicle for turning scandium oxide into **ScAl master alloys**, niobium oxide into **aerospace-grade Nb-bearing specialty alloys**, and rare earth oxides into value-added magnet feedstock. This is the “mine → oxide → alloy → end-user” chain that the EXIM Bank and DoD prefer, because it derisks U.S. supply and guarantees domestic value capture. The structure mirrors what USA Rare Earth is building with Round Top + Stillwater — but NioCorp already owns its deposit outright, already owns the IP for its extraction flow sheet, and already controls the alloy IP and brand through NAMA.

[NioCorp has solved \\""The Chicken or the Egg problem!\\"" & it's Scandium Aluminum Alloys are at the forefront, but do NOT overlook Niobium, Titanium & TiCl-4, Tb, Dy & Nd\/Pr! Note: Jim Sims has stated testing & more has been going on behind the scenes for \\""ALL!\\""](https://reddit.com/link/1pkr4k0/video/dxg1n1j8sr6g1/player)

The scale of potential Revenue Expansion from this integration is enormous. Scandium alone (100 t/yr nameplate) becomes exponentially more valuable when sold not as oxide but as **ScAl alloys** to aerospace primes — and NioCorp already has 12% contracted through Traxys with 88% left open for DFARS-compliant partners (Lockheed, Boeing, Howmet, ATI, Century, etc.). Add the downstream monetization of TiCl₄, TiO₂, niobium ferroalloys, and rare earth magnet feedstock, and NioCorp becomes a **multi-product strategic metals platform**, not a single-oxide miner.

In short: while others are still proving their chemistry in multi-year pilot plants, **NioCorp’s hydromet + SX process is already validated, designed, and priced**, and their vertical-integration move (via FEA IP + NAMA) positions them as one of the most complete, U.S.-anchored critical-mineral supply chains in development. This is why EXIM, DoD, and Tier-1 primes are in deep discussions — they need a fully domestic, fully integrated producer, and NioCorp is already architected to deliver exactly that.

***This is how you rebuild U.S. materials sovereignty —*** not one metal at a time, but with a single project that brings SEVEN critical minerals into four critical defense mineral chains back onshore at once!

**When the dust settles, Elk Creek won’t be “a mine.” It will be a cornerstone of the U.S. national security ecosystem.**  
The U.S. is signaling it. EXIM just confirmed it. And the global critical-mineral bottleneck is about to meet its first American challenger in decades.

# NioCorp isn’t just part of the solution — it’s the platform the solution gets built on!

# ⚙️ Elk Creek is a U.S. National Security Asset!

Reading posts here has helped me understand myself better and realize how many people have experiences similar to mine.

I was diagnosed with ADHD at 13 by my doctor. I tried Ritalin back then, but I quickly stopped because the side effects were too strong. I’m extremely sensitive to stimulants.

I’m 29 now and I’ve been untreated most of my life. About two months ago, I discovered Semax, and it honestly changed things for me. For the first time, I felt fully functional, more stable, and many of my usual problems were reduced.

The downside with Semax is that tolerance builds quickly. On off days, I go back to my baseline state. I’m not even sure if the “crash” feels worse than before, or if it’s just my normal untreated ADHD state.

I currently live in Thailand, where Vyvanse isn’t available, which is frustrating because it seems to work well for people who are very sensitive to stimulants like me.

I’m planning to try Ritalin again, but based on past experience, I’m worried it will trigger anxiety and make me feel socially off. When I take stimulants, I tend to become very serious, less emotional, I don’t laugh much, and socializing becomes harder.

I am ultra sensitive to all stimulants, sugar, coffee, and any drug. And when I use none of them, I am just feeling weak, I stay in bed and watch tv and try to do the minimal, just to stay functional and updated in my life. I almost don't work and feel like I could have never followed a normal working path. Social situations make me tired, I believe this is just another impact of my adhd. I have gone through social anxiety that I believe is not based on trauma, it's just my brain that can't focus on one thing and talking long sentences or just reply to day to day situations are more complicated for me.

Thank you for reading, and feel free to share anything that comes to mind.

1pkr3a0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BaliTravelTips/comments/1pkr3a0/mt_batur_climb_advice/,Mt Batur Climb Advice,"My partner and I are looking to climb Mt Batur in a few days and have just read a lot of reviews on Google, AllTrails Etc. The strongman tactics used to get tourists to pay, in our opinion, crazy fees just to climb the mountain is completely off putting. We are experienced in climbing and hiking and the message of “needing” a guide is pretty off putting when there are detailed maps to follow and well… it’s a mountain. 

Anyway, I just wanted to ask:

\- Are the “checkpoints” as the base of the mountain really that intense and do the locals really get aggressive? 

\- What are people’s experiences climbing the mountain without a guide and what recommendations do you have?

\- Are there people looking to do the same in the next few days and would you like to go together? 

\- If guides are REALLY needed then what are the cheapest options (we will be in the area already)

\- Any other relevant info/ advice

I would just like to clarify that we are completely respectful of the culture and values of Bali/ Indonesia as a whole. We aren’t littering or treating the land in a bad way (that’s just against what we stand for in general). All we want to do is climb the mountain in peace, hope we avoid a busy morning, and take in the views. Preferably without a guide pushing coffee tourist traps and instead with likeminded people.

For starters, I’m 26F and during my first doctor’s visit with a new doctor, she diagnosed me with hypertension. I couldn’t honestly believe it and immediately started denying it and all. She put me on irbestatan 150mg to take daily. I’m currently now on day 4 and I’m going thru it 😭 my anxiety is thru the mf roof! 

Very important to mention that I also have been diagnosed with GAD (general anxiety disorder) and currently on meds for that. I actually stopped taking my birth control pills because my doctor also said that the estrogen in them can cause hpb. 

For the most part the first 2 days of the meds were fine. No new changes then all of a sudden day 3 hits and I’m a complete mess. My anxiety is crazy high and actually reduced eating habits due to it. I don’t snack anymore, cut out all the bad stuff including my coffees. I’ve been also sticking to my water and nothing else because I’m actually scared if I drink anything else that it’s going to be bad. I’m also experiencing these crazy symptoms too that are also not good for my anxiety so it heightens it even more like racing obsessive thoughts about my heart, brain wooshes (getting up too fast or eyes locking in too fast feeling) pins and needles, headaches, jitters that I can’t seem to stop. Just general on edge and can’t seem to calm down type feeling. 

I just feel like a failure about this because this diagnosis truly scared me. I know that my eating habits sucked but tbh i didn’t think it was this bad. I do cook most meals at home, rarely eat out etc. I do have a great support system at home and even realized that hypertension runs in my family (my grandpa has it and then my dad) so it could be genetics too. 

At the end of the day, I’m grateful for this health scare as crazy as that sounds because with not that many family doctors where I’m from, it’s super hard to find one and given that I was brought in on a cancellation  who knows what would’ve happened. I think it was meant to be and a sign for sure and so I’m changing my entire lifestyle now too for the better ofc. Even tho I work a 9-5 in a medical office, I need to get back on track. This cannot continue on.  

I’ve actually been so scared since this diagnosis that my anxiety caused me to lose most of my appetite so I have not been eating excessively like I used to. I know that this diagnosis is not a death sentence and it is reversible through mostly lifestyle changes. Im still young enough so actually getting a grip on it now compared to down the line etc. I’m getting bloodwork done today and then will be seeing her on Monday for another follow up. She has also explained that using a GLP-1 may also help me which I think I’m going to ask her about it more because I do need a change. I can’t keep going on like this. 

Has anyone else been feeling like this when they first started? ",2,1765543631.0,hypertension,0,1.0,False

We'd only been dating for a year, but there have been a lot of what-ifs and buts and I always found those hardest to get over, as someone previously hung up on exes for years on end.

First things first: you have to WANT to get over them. Seriously. Do not stay in touch, do not try to get closure. They're not going to give it to you. Only you can. Everything they might say, every reason for breaking it off, every issue, is not going to be something you want to hear, or want to hear again. It might seem passive-aggressive, but just block them. Don't stalk them, don't text them, don't call them. This is about you and your new life without them.

If you need to, re-assess who you were without them. Even if you don't feel like it, DO the things you used to like without them and you'll find you still feel good about them. Hang out with friends, cry and complain to them, and really tune in to your support system. They WANT to help you, and they love you, unlike your ex, probably. If they loved you enough, they would've stayed. Hard pill to swallow, but there's no way around that truth and you HAVE to accept it. Even if there were other reasons for having to break up and they do still love you and you do love them, it. was. not. enough.

Make a list of your ideal partner, and figure out whatever it is on that list they couldn't provide to you. Or if they treated you badly, make a list of that. Be angry for a while if you need to, but try to let go. Don't sulk. Forgive them when you're ready, and forgive yourself. Especially if you know you gave it your all: you handled accordingly to what you thought was best AT THE TIME. Nothing would have gone differently, and no matter how tempting it is to linger on those what-ifs, don't. You can't change the past. Nobody can. Don't hold on to hope. Don't try to better yourself for them. Do it for you.

Be single for a while and resist the urge to replace them. You can do it. Life is fun. Take it one day at a time. Give in to the feelings and let them be, but don't linger. Eventually you'll realize you're thinking of them for 23 hours a day instead of 24, and slowly, they'll become a distant memory. It'll come with confusing feelings, maybe even guilt for moving on, sadness for forgetting what they looked or sounded like, but that's okay, and natural. They're just someone who used to know you well, and now they're a part of your past. And if you want to move on, they will have to stay a part of your past. Forever.

They will also move on. They might be dating someone else already, hell, they might even be in a relationship with someone else now. But that doesn't mean anything. It doesn't say anything about you or their relationship with you. Maybe they did feel a need to replace you because you were so important to them, or maybe not. Maybe they just didn't care about you. And that sucks, but it does not define your worth at ALL.

I never thought I would be where I am now, but I'm honestly fine. Just three weeks ago, I remember calling my mom crying and hyperventilating saying I can't do this. Not again. I cried and cried and cried and felt so low. But I'm fine now. Maybe even happier than when I was with him. Sure, there's no more intimacy, love, hugs, sharing moments together, and that's something I do miss sometimes. But there's also no more why's, no more moments of despair, no more wondering what his behavior means, no more missing him when he leaves, no more confusion, no more stress, no more nothing. And no void to fill, or need to replace him. I'm just... happy. Content. And I LOVE it.

Do you. You can do it. You can get over them. You want to. I believe in you. You will be okay.

And btw I actually wann thanks whoever made me download the Refeel app ( it's available for free in the app store if someone needs it. ) it helped me soooo much w No Contact and overcoming him.



Edit: I'd like to add some of the smaller things I did to make myself feel ""whole"" again that actually helped: it's a cliché, but journaling. Writing letters to them with everything you want to say, but never sending them. And gratitude. Just write down one or two things you were grateful for everyday, even seemingly tiny things such as a good coffee you had, or a cute cat you saw. It might feel meaningless at first, but you'll notice you'll actually start to appreciate living in the moment again, and feeling better just because you're alive and get to experience these things, with or without someone to experience them with you.

Edit four months later: yup, I was over them. It wasn't that I still had to feel the crash, I was just over them. Also found out he's just objectively a shitty person. Ended up wanting to talk to him because I hate leaving things in a negative way and he just refused and even ended up calling me names and responding as if I broke up with him and came back for sex or something. So my mind just kind of forgets he even exists at all, lol.",11,1765543093.0,BreakUps,6,0.76,False

The trip was really short. I was staying 30 minutes away for just 4 days. We went through hell to be able to meet everyday. Often times I wouldn’t even know if I could see him until a couple of hours before actually seeing him. But god damn was he worth every fucking stress and barrier I faced this trip. Here were the major “barriers” of the trip for those who are curious: lost luggage (lost presents for him 😭, local laws around modesty, local culture against PDA, work schedules, and familial duties. 

The highlights of my trip was honestly being able to hit so many of the coffee and tea spots he has been raving to me over the past 6 months of us talking. I literally found my new favorite drink location in the world. I joke to him about ruining my taste buds… so I guess I have to come back if I want to enjoy food again. We honestly didn’t do a bunch of things. We really just sat and talked… kind of like we did online, but now we got to do it in person while studying the details of each other’s face. We got as far as holding hands and him giving me a gentle peck on my hand and my forehead. I felt like a little girl again. It was a fairytale experience. He’s literally what I dreamed of growing up. I just ended up lowering my expectations because I was told what I wanted isn’t attainable… by literal therapist. But it turns out, what I wanted does exist and can be healthy. I just needed to find the right person who values what I value. Some might see our relationship as codependence and think it’s bad, but another way of seeing it is two people who are so in love that they want to devote themselves to taking care of the other person. We have each other’s back. We are each other’s partner in life.

I just spend 24+ hours traveling back to my home country. The only reason I managed to not cry the whole time was because (1) I was genuinely too exhausted to cry, and (2) I spent 35 euro so I could text him during the plane ride home. 

What our future holds: we both are now focused on finding new and stable revenue incomes so we can close the gap asap. We want to get married, but we want to do things the right way so that we are more likely to survive the hardships. But no matter what it takes, we will find a way to be in each other’s arm again and forever.

My MIL is… enthusiastic. She means well, she’s not evil, but she’s the kind of person who thinks love is measured in the size of the bag you carry into someone’s house. Every visit comes with “just a little something” and it’s never little. It’s usually plastic, bright, and it makes sound. Like the kind of toy where you press one button and it plays a 12 second song on loop until your brain melts.



We’ve tried to be polite about it. We’ve said things like “Oh wow, thank you” and then quietly rotate the toys out. But it’s gotten to the point where our living room looks like a daycare waiting area, and my kid is the type who will find the loudest thing in the room and commit to it for 40 minutes straight. Also, and I feel guilty saying this, I get overstimulated really fast. I work from home some days, my husband works long hours, and when I finally have a calm moment, the last thing I want is a toy guitar screaming “LET’S ROCK” at 7:10am.



Two weeks ago MIL shows up with this big gift bag and inside is a toy drum set. Not like a cute little tambourine. A drum set with sticks, flashing lights, and a “demo mode” that basically does a full concert. She hands it to my kid and says “Now you can make music for mommy!” I smiled, but my stomach dropped. My husband did this awkward laugh and said, “Mom, that’s… loud.” She goes “Kids are loud! It’s normal.” Then she added, “You were such a quiet baby, he needs to get it out.” Which felt like a dig, honestly.



That night my kid wouldn’t go to bed because she kept asking for “drums” and then in the morning she woke up and immediately ran to it. I had a meeting at 9 and I’m trying to get coffee made while she’s bashing the drums like she’s headlining a festival. I opened the kitchen drawer to grab batteries and realized I now keep a whole pack of AA’s just to feed these toys, which made me feel kind of insane. Like my life is now scheduled around batteries and noise.



So I talked to my husband and said we need to address it, because if we don’t it’s gonna keep happening. He agreed but didn’t want to “hurt her feelings.” I said fine, I’ll do it, but I’m not going to be mean. When MIL came over again, I had the drum set back in the box and a couple other loud toys she’d given recently. I told her, “I really appreciate that you want to spoil her, but the noise toys are too much for our house. We’re trying to keep the space calmer. Can you please stop buying toys with sound?” She stared at me like I said I hated children. Then she goes, “So you’re taking away her joy because you don’t like noise?” I said no, we play with her, we just prefer quieter stuff, books, blocks, outside things. She said, “You’re controlling. Let her be a kid.” Then she got teary and told my husband, “Your wife doesn’t want me to bond with my grandbaby.”



My husband tried to smooth it over, but she left early. Now she’s texting him links to “educational musical toys” and saying I embarrassed her, and my SIL messaged me “wow, returning gifts is rude.” I feel like I set a boundary that’s normal, but I also know returning a gift can look harsh. AITAH for boxing them up and asking her to stop with the loud toys?

1pkqru6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness_India/comments/1pkqru6/somethings_need_to_be_changed_need_advice/,Somethings need to be changed. Need advice.,"So from the past few days I have been feeling a little low on motivation. It feels like something in my routine is off. My entire day is on repeat. Wake up. Gym. College. Come back tired. Sleep. Repeat.

I honestly love the gym part. That is not the issue. I even enjoy the small things like my pre workout protein. I used to take this strawberry chunk flavour from Neulife and recently switched to the coffee one which actually tastes pretty good. So the gym is still something I look forward to.

The weird part is that even after liking my routine, there is this feeling that something is missing. I cannot point out what exactly. It is not burnout but it is also not excitement. More like a flat line feeling throughout the day. I get things done but nothing feels engaging.

I am wondering if I should add something new to my routine. Maybe a hobby. Maybe a weekend activity. Maybe a change in how I spend my evenings. I am not sure what people my age usually do to keep things fresh.

If anyone here has gone through this or figured out a way to deal with this type of phase let me know. Should I add something else to my day or is this normal and just a cycle everyone goes through?

Trying to understand if this is just a temporary slump or a sign that I need a small lifestyle switch.",1,1765542854.0,Fitness_India,0,1.0,False

1pkqm3l,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheJerk/comments/1pkqm3l/aitj_for_asking_my_family_not_to_touch_my_vinyl/,AITJ for asking my family not to touch my vinyl collection during a get-together?,"I’m 29M and I’ve been collecting vinyl for about 8 years. Nothing crazy like museum-level rare stuff, but I do have some out of print albums and a couple I saved up for (I’m talking $100-150 range, not thousands). I keep them in my living room on a low shelf, because that’s where my turntable is. This weekend my mom wanted to do a “casual family hang” at my place since I have the biggest space. It was my parents, my sister (26F), my aunt and uncle (mid 50s), and two cousins. Before anyone arrived I moved anything fragile off the coffee table, put coasters out, did the whole “please don’t let people do dumb stuff in my apartment” routine. When everyone came in, I said hi, pointed out where drinks and snacks were, and I also said, pretty calmly, “Hey quick thing, please don’t handle the records, some of them scratch really easily.” Nobody said anything, so I assumed fine.



About an hour in, my uncle notices the shelf and goes “Oh wow, you still do this old school thing?” He walks over and starts pulling records out by pinching the edge like it’s a pizza slice. I immediately got up and said, “Hey, sorry, could you not pull those out? If you want to see what I have I can show you.” He kind of laughed and goes, “Relax, I’m not gonna break your little toys.” I tried to keep it light and said, “It’s not about breaking them, it’s about scratches and fingerprints, it’s just my hobby.” He then starts telling my cousins to come look and one of them (19M) reaches for the stack too. I said again, more firm this time, “Please don’t. Seriously.” My uncle puts the record back kinda rough, like it makes a little thud, and says, “You’re being precious. It’s just music.”



This is where it got ugly. He tells my mom, loud enough for everyone, “Your son is acting like a snob with his fancy records.” My mom does that nervous laugh and says “He’s just particular.” My aunt says “Let him be, it’s his house,” but then my uncle goes “Yeah well if he’s gonna be like this, why invite us.” I felt my face get hot and I said, “I invited you, I didn’t invite you to mess with my stuff.” He snapped back “Don’t talk to me like I’m a child.” I said, “Then don’t act like one?” which I admit was a bit much. My sister pulled me aside and said I should just apologize to keep the peace, because “it’s not worth it.” But it kind of is worth it to me, because it’s my apartment and my collection is like, one of the few things I actually take care of and enjoy. The rest of the night was awkward, and when they left my mom texted me that I embarrassed my uncle over “some plastic discs.” Now my parents want me to call him and smooth it over. I feel like I set one simple boundary and he made it a power thing. AITJ for refusing to let him handle my vinyl and pushing back when he got rude?

1pkqlyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/POIS/comments/1pkqlyp/cutting_caffeine_completely_switched_to_chicory/,Cutting caffeine completely (switched to chicory) reduced my POIS symptoms ~95%,"I wanted to share something surprisingly impactful in case it helps someone else here.

For years, coffee was a big trigger for me. On its own, it already made me lethargic, irritable, and mentally scattered. But with POIS, those effects were amplified badly especially brain fog, poor focus, and memory issues.

A few weeks ago, I decided to cut caffeine completely:

No coffee

No caffeine based soda

No very dark chocolate


Instead, I replaced coffee with chicory (chicorée) as a hot drink(or cold with milk) 

As a result my POIS symptoms are about 95% less severe.
Most days, I barely notice the brain fog that used to be constant after ejaculation.

I’m not claiming this is a cure or that it’ll work for everyone. But for me, the difference has been very noticeable. 

My personal theory (just a theory):
Chicory is rich in inulin (a prebiotic fiber), which may help feed beneficial gut bacteria and possibly support gut lining health. Since there’s increasing discussion around gut–brain and immune involvement in POIS, I wonder if improving gut health reduced inflammation or neurological symptoms in my case.

This is anecdotal but I just wanted to share because this was such a simple change with an big effect for me.

If anyone else has experimented with caffeine elimination, gut-focused approaches, or chicory specifically, I’d be really curious to hear your experience.

I look at all these profiles with amazing yet normal people putting in the hard work and getting the results that make the dream before and after. To everyone who has done it please understand you are an inspiration! So firstly thank you all 

Which is why I am here, for inspiration, but that doesn’t get you very far… I know it’s discipline & putting in the work. 

So questions for all; 

what was your key that unlocked your potential? 

Was it all at once or baby steps? 

Did you plan or just do? 

How did you speak to your significant other about starting your journey? 

How did you start?

How did you keep going?

Did you have many false starts and feel like a failure? 

About me for context, and any specific advice that may be out there.

I am early 40s (m), half time dad to a Tween and full time to a new born (comes with a significant lack of sleep and an amazing new partner) 

Work a ridiculously stressful, high pace job as a Senior Manager in Construction Management but still manage to sneak in school pickups/ dad taxi for sports & scouts and helping to maintain a household. 

Also have a touch of ADHD (this can be a superpower or the biggest anchor, think 10 tasks at once but it’s a lottery if they get finished and you a) win or b) have your partner walk in with all cupboards open, pans burning, fridge open whilst you’re cleaning a coffee machine and listening. To a podcast)

I have a good enough home gym set up and understand programming (used to be mad into lifting) but now I just can’t stick to anything, even a 1 lift per day programme gets only 3 solid weeks before it tapers off 😬  

Also love to cook and go through meal prep phases… but the kicker is I have been a heavy evening drinker for probably 15years, usually wine and beer but walk the line of high functioning  hangovers most days (I do track LFT / ALT sometimes great sometime terrible) 

Obviously weight is up and down along with alcohol consumption having good and bad months.

This should be simple right? 

So sorry for the many questions and many words for a first post and thank you all again for sharing your experience.

1pkqgms,https://www.reddit.com/r/shayy/comments/1pkqgms/captured_by_batlike_cryptids_an_agent_carries/,"Captured by bat-like cryptids, an agent carries their brood. As they grow within her, so does her outlook.","She could feel them *writhing* in her. 



Agent Owens glared down at her abnormally swollen, vast gravid belly. “Little freaks,” she swore. “Let me fucking *rest* already…”



The agent leaned back against the redwood tree, cradled by its vastness. The Pacific Northwest was as cool and misty as the stereotypes indicated, though the vast growths shielded her from the worst of the weather. As for the rest, her bureau’s survival training had kicked in. Even while pregnant, Owens could rely on the bureau’s instructions for survival in the wild. 



Though this was hardly a *usual* pregnancy…



*You should go back*, Owens thought miserably as her brood continued to toss and turn inside of her. Barely two and a half months after the incident and she already looked well overdue, as if she had been expecting twins a week ago… *Surrender to the bureau. They can cut these things out of you. Return you to normal. You can be a woman again, not this… this incubator…*



But she knew better than that. The bureau wouldn’t just send her on her way. It’s why she had resisted returning even after they’d initially rescued her. Best case scenario they’d shutter her in a room for observation for years to ensure she hadn’t been compromised by the creatures. Perhaps they’d never let her out. Perhaps they’d dispose of her just like the monstrosities she carried. 



Another part of her, deep in the recesses of the mind, whispered that the *real* reason she wasn’t going back was because she *was* compromised. Though the things that had gotten their claws on her (their claws… and much more besides) were by all appearances dumb beasts, little more than cryptids, the bureau had several records of seemingly harmless or simple things having effects on human mentality. And the fact that they could impregnate humans clearly gave some link to humanity that went unexplored…



The dark thoughts in Owens’s mind left her shifting back against the gnarled root of the tree and she gasped at a thin, sharp pain on her arm. Trembling, the agent lifted her forearm to see a long, shallow cut gently oozing blood over her flesh. 



Blood… fresh blood…



Her reservations against this strange new behavior had long since been subsumed by the realities of her new life. How much blood had she partaken of? How much more would she continue to?



*This is your own blood, Agent Owens. It won’t add anything you haven’t already lost…*



And yet it didn’t change anything. The scars on her neck, they *itched…*



With hungry fervor, Agent Owens licked the blood off her arm. It tasted sharp, metallic, clean; the brood in her belly lurched harder than ever. *More*, *mother*, they seemed to croon at her. *More…*



*I’m not your mother*, she thought, a notion as desperate as it was factually incorrect. But regardless of her higher feelings on the matter, Owens had no choice to obey. 



She fixed her mouth on her cut and sucked the blood out. She could feel it splashing against her gums and mingling with her saliva; it wormed its way into the cracks between her teeth, staining them penny red. Awash in the sensation of the sharp iron kiss, she gulped it down, feeling it trickle down her esophagus. When she was finally spent, Owens leaned back with a groan. As they always did when she gave them nourishment, her offspring were active beyond words, agitating her stomach to the point where a staccato of bumps showed themselves on the sphere of her belly. 



“Please… just let me rest…” she whispered. Her eyes fluttered. “Please just… let me wake up from this nightmare…”



\---



*”We’ve had reports of several deaths by exsanguination in rural Oregon and the coastal regions of Northern California.” The director sipped coffee as he rapped his knuckles against a projected map of the region. “Reports line up with monsters from local folklore resembling bats the size of large dogs.”*



*“So what, boss, are you saying that there’s giant vampire bats in the region?” The rookie agent who spoke up was cocky and sardonic.* 



*In response, the director wordlessly clicked to the next slide. The blurry photo showed two gargantuan, brown-black furry figures silhouetted against rich-barked trees. Though the photo was not exactly high-quality, it was obvious what they were looking at.* 



*“Yes, agent,” the director said, “that is what we’re saying.”*



*The girl who would grow into the woman known as Agent Owens had always excelled. In school she’d been a sporty athlete at the top of her class academically, earning a full ride scholarship. In university she’d been scouted by the FBI, and from there to the nameless bureau that handled “supra-natural” incidents on U.S. soil. She’d excelled in her training and had quickly been appointed the leader of a small strike squad.*



*“Attacks have mostly been on large livestock like horses and cattle,” the director had told her. “But attacks on humans have been reported and are trending upwards. Confirm the existence of the anomalies and, if necessary, eliminate. Lethal force pre-approved.”*



*Owens had nodded. Giant bats were freaky enough, but still just animals. This was going to be a simple one. Done like dinner. First things first? Commandeer a large ranch that had been abandoned due to activity. Set up a dummy target in the nearby barn, a well-hidden observation post, and a base in the secure ranch house.* 



*Foolishly, she hadn’t bothered to check the house’s attic. None of them had. Why would they? There were no reports of the beasts invading domiciles and no sign of broken windows or any other entry. No one had any reason to believe they had made their way inside.*



*At least not until they swooped down in the dark.* 



*God, how many had there been? The roar of gunfire and the gust of flapping wings had woken Owens from her slumber. By the time she grabbed her sidearm they’d already broken down the unlocked bedroom door. They weren’t just the size of large dogs, they had the strength to match.* 



*In the darkness they were like churning shadows, visible as vague umbral shapes rushing through the night. Owens shot once, her bullet ripping through one’s wing membrane; the muzzle flash momentarily lit the room, displaying a pair flat-nosed visages like hellishly large rodents gifted the worst aspects of porcine features. The bats bullrushed her, pinning her onto the bed with limbs far stronger than they had any right to be and the weight of two combined. Owens struggled to free herself and tried to angle her gun at the creatures, but she could get no good shot; she inadequately opened fire widely, her bullet smashing through the glass-paned window. Then one of them pressed its weight against her forearm and she inadvertently dropped it.* 



*She could hear the other two members of her squad crying out from other rooms amidst the sound of more activity. One was clearly screaming in fearful anger, the other was moaning in what sounded like pain and sounded weaker by the minute.*



*The foremost of the bats pinning her leaned its head over her, its ugly squat nose snuffling. It opened its mouth and in the dim light Owens saw the gentle glint of white teeth, a mouthful of them as long and pointed as human’s incisors. It lowered its mouth to her face and she smelled its breath, like a day-old abattoir; she felt sick. Perversely, it was like the beast was going in for a kiss…*



*But it wasn’t. Instead the bat nipped the crook of her neck, the spot where it met her shoulder. It was a shallow bite and one that thankfully didn’t endanger her jugular or other arteries, but the blood still flowed fresh and clean and the beast eagerly lapped it off her skin.*



*Its tongue felt perversely like that of a dog; long and broad and flat and warm, and positively oozing with saliva. As part of the pre-mission report, Owens had read that vampire bat saliva possessed an anticoagulant effect that kept the blood flowing. But she never could have anticipated that these beasts’ saliva had another quality as well; it was paralytic and fast-acting. Owens wheezed as her whole body seized up. She could feel everything that was happening to her, but could move nothing more than her eyes and expel weak, groaning cries. By now the noise of her two agents had quieted as well. The bats were going to feed…*



*Except she had no clue what else they had in store for her. While one lapped her blood, the other would indulge a different form of hunger. With strong claws, the lower of the two bats scrabbled angrily at the dark black trousers Owens wore as part of her typical “government MIB” look. Finally the button snapped off and the beast managed to yank down her trousers and underwear.*



*Even here, Owens hadn’t figured out what was about to happen to her. She thought it would go for the artery in her thigh; when it snuffled close to the fork of her legs she assumed this must be the end.* 



*But then something entirely unexpected happened: a mysterious, foreign warmth touched her womanhood.* 



*Owens’s eyes widened and even paralyzed as she was she managed a singular, shocked wheeze.* 



*Oh God. It was… they were…*



*“Nnnnnn—“ she moaned, unable to articulate anything more. Fear and desperation braided together in her alongside a new sensation, wholly unwanted: arousal. Her body didn’t understand that it was a beast, a cryptid, that was doing this to her. All it knew was that it felt good.* 



*Treacherous. That was the word for it. As the foremost of the beasts continued to lick at her throat, drinking her lifeblood eagerly, the one below licked at her womanhood. A broad, warm tongue flashed across her labia and kneaded pleasure into her. It radiated out of her groin and into the rest of her, riding her veins like highways. Her muscles tensed and sweat headed on her skin; her hearteate quickened, and not just from fear.* 



*This couldn’t be happening.* 



*After a few minutes of lapping at her, the lower cryptid lifted its head from her muff. Its muzzle was slick and wet from her own juices and its eyes searched her body, questing with lustful hunger. Its gaze lingered in places it shouldn’t have—the flush of her cheeks, the swell of her breasts. Fear whipped through Owens’s mind. This was just an animal, right? Then why was it looking at her like this? Why was it…?*



*The creature lifted its body a little higher and the bitter truth revealed itself. Sprouting between its hind legs was a vivid cock, so deeply red it was almost purple. Canine in shape and size, complete with a fat knot near the base, thin liquid was trailing out of the tip.* 



*As the beast lined up with its prey, Owens wanted to scream—DON’T! YOU CAN’T! YOU MUSTN’T! But all that emerged was quiet, pathetic whimpers. She was pinned and paralyzed and weak from blood loss. She could do nothing but… but watch as the creature had its way…*



*And have its way it did. It plunged inside, uncompromising as only a beast could be; uncaring of foreplay or the ideas of Owens’s readiness.* 



*Oh God, she ached to take it. The massive shaft pressed against her and then forced her to part. With paralysis still whipping through her body, she had no control over her response. Her body reacted on autopilot. She clenched and squeezed, making the massive invader stand out that much more against her; the beast chirred pleasantly, happy to feel her body rewarding it. Bracing itself around her, it bucked again, harder; the pressure was so ferocious that it caused the ranch bed’s backboard to clatter against the wall. The beast at her throat had stopped licking and was watching the tryst unveil with interest; in the other room, the voices of Owens’s two agents had stilled forever. Both male, they were useful to the beasts for nothing but blood, and had already been exhausted of it.* 



*With bestial energy, the cryptid had its way. Paralyzed, Owens could do nothing but take it. Her cunt ached and her flesh shivered, and despite herself there was a quickening of the pace and a blooming of the flesh that betrayed her. She didn’t want to like this, but her body gave her no choice. The repeating sense of the beast thrusting into her melted from a distracting soreness to something deeper, a low burning feeling of enjoyment that made her flesh tingle and her fingertips burn. Oh God. Was she really going to orgasm from being used, being raped by a beast?!*



*“Nnnnn!” Owens murmured incoherently, tears flecking her eyes. She wanted this to end. For the beast to satisfy itself before her body betrayed her utterly. She couldn’t cum from this… she mustn’t. Anything but that.* 



*But it was not to be. The throbbing cock plunged deep into her and the fat knot knocked against her. Woth trepidation, Owens realized it was going to push in—tying them together. The beast snarled triumphantly and bucked in again, and again—and then the knot sank home.* 



*The spread, larger than anything she’d ever taken, was enough to break her. The strain snapped through her, accompanied by the sharpest orgasm of her life. A split second later, the monster’s shaft throbbed inside and she felt hot, wet seed spilling into her most intimate reaches. The beast held against her, panting, and then slumped, tied to its mate by its still-pumping knot. Finding the trickle of blood at her throat, her violator lazily lapped at her. From the other room, more beasts emerged, their snouts and muzzles splashed crimson with the blood of Owens’s fallen comrades. They were male too, as evidenced by the lengths between their legs, and were clearly also interested in their catch.*



*As the newly-applied paralytic sensation of venom seized her body up, Owens realized that her ordeal was only just beginning. The beast tugged at her and its knot yanked her womanhood. She whined. It was too big to leave, but the beast still wanted to. It yanked again. She whined. As soon as it was out, its cohorts would take sloppy seconds.* 



*This she knew.*



\---



Down below, a doe tracked through the ravine. Owens waited above and dropped the heavy rock with perfect timing. The deer went down immediately, a fast and clean death. 



The smell of blood danced through the air. It made her salivate. 



Carefully, the pregnant woman clambered down the side of the ravine. Her vast, gravid stomach was an obstacle, but one that had become second nature to her in recent weeks. In quieter times when she had her thoughts to herself, the realization of how familiar her status had gotten horrified her. Now, however, she was just hungry—hungry for blood to energize herself and her brood. 



She alit on the ravine floor with a *whuff* of breath. Not only was her stomach larger, but her breasts were sore and milk-heavy, and even her hips had become rounder. She was the very image of a mother-to-be. 



Never mind that her children were bestial monsters, just like their sire. 



Owens made her way to the fallen doe and quickly slurped up the blood. She would eat the meat too, of course, but the blood—raw fluid, nourishing and lifegiving—called to her. Her body spiked with triumph as she gulped it down, and her brood churned and tumbled and maneuvered sharp in her womb at it. They stole most of what Owens ate; the umbilical was a chain that meant she couldn’t escape them. Whatever blood she swallowed was siphoned to them, and they writhed within her, energized. Her only purpose was to shield and nourish them. 



After what had to be a liter or more of blood, the pups in her belly finally quieted, satisfied, and Owens turned her attention to the meat. She used a survival knife pilfered from one of her ‘rescuers’ to slice ribbons of flesh and gulped them down. Raw meat was supposed to be bad for humans but she digested it no problem. But with the brood in her belly and her new sanguine appetite, did she really count as human anymore?



Flashes of recollection tramped through her mind as she ate. The weeks she’d spent as those creatures’s plaything, constantly paralyzed from their attentions and servicing them a half-dozen times or more a day. Being force-fed prey they hunted from the nearby farms or forests, granting her a taste for raw meat. 



The horror, the *horror* of noticing the impossible—of seeing her belly swell in a fashion that couldn’t be blamed on her new diet, compounded with the stirrings of the new life within. Pregnant with more of these *things.* Reduced to an incubator, a living cradle for a brood of cryptid pups. 



Oh, how fast she’d grown. 



Rescue had come far too late. A month into her captivity at least, by which time she was visibly pregnant and could feel the weight of her litter nestled behind her navel. She still recalled the looks of shock and disgust on her fellow agents when they’d found her; nude, swollen, debased. That night, not trusting her treatment at the hands of the bureau, she’d escaped. She told herself it was for her own good, not because the creatures had compromised her. She’d only partially believed it then. She barely believed it now. 



Finished with the doe, Owens carved bones out of the carcass and snapped them to suck the marrow clean. The rest she’d leave for scavengers to pick through. As she ate, she rested one hand on the curve of her stomach. The pups within pushed back against her, the movements like tiny quakes against her palms. 



The feelings they instigated in her were indescribable. The sensation of fierce protectiveness—her young, her offspring, her *brood—*were counterbalanced by remembrance of how, exactly, they’d arrived to be there. She vividly recalled the sensation of taking monster cock. Of despairing at the breedings. The rapes. 



What a melange of emotion. Maternal, violated, maternal *because* violated. Deep down Owens knew she ought to be horrified. That she ought to find the agents who were doubtless still searching for her in the forest. (They’d never find her. She was the best in the bureau’s history at wilderness survival, and that was before she had maternal instinct demanding perfection of her.) 



She knew that the things she carried inside of her were abominations. If brought to term, if birthed, they would prey on livestock and people. Her sons might well find another human just like their mother and rut her full of pups. She was *compromised.* She had to accept it. 



But she couldn’t act on it. Her instincts, the wordless impulses that drove her onward, were too powerful to shake. She was a slave to them, now. A slave to the beasts. A slave to her brood. 



The scar on her neck, the place where her feral violators had kissed her, itched. She rubbed a finger against it. The healed skin was thinner and she imagined that she could feel the lifeblood pulsing underneath. When it grew hard to hunt, she could always find more blood to nourish the pups in her belly. 



Oh yes.



\---



Three months and change after the disastrous night at the ranch house, Owens’s hunt for more prey was interrupted by a sharp twinge in her belly. She hissed in surprise. Was it happening? Was it—



The twinge returned, stronger and more insistent, and she groaned as she felt herself slipping into the thrall of instinct. Labor was upon her. 



Okay. Okay. 



Half-waddling, half-limping from her hunting spot, Owens returned to the shelter she’d made for herself—a hollow on the bank of a stream, covered with overhanging roots of a streambank tree, the interior lifted up to avoid incursions from the water. She crawled inside; the interior was snug, warm, humid. Just like an amnion. They would find it comfortable and familiar. 



Instinct told her to rest on hands and knees and she obeyed, panting like a bitch in heat. Her belly lurched and she felt the first pup settle into her birthing canal. It was smaller than a human infant but still far larger than anything she’d experienced before, cock included. Grunting, gasping, the agent breathed hot and shallow breaths in time to her heartbeat and slowly squeezed it out, feeling herself part all the way. 



The beast broke free and plopped against the sandy floor of the den. A single umbilical connected it to her womanhood; she would sever this later with a stone or her knife. (Not teeth. She was no animal.)



Feeling the next pup settle in to be born, Owens grabbed her firstborn and cradled him (he was male; she suspected they all were, relying on other mammals, humans included, to nurture their brood) to her chest. 



He snuffled at her teat but did not take it in mouth. What he wanted was richer than milk. 



Of course. Her body had developed milk because that’s what a human child would need; it didn’t understand it would be made to serve something wilder. With one long fingernail, Owens scratched her breast near the areola. Thin blood began beading there. The pup squeaked and scrabbled and she held him up and he began to nurse, not milk but blood. Pressure rocked her body and she pushed as the next offspring began inching forward to be born. 



Already, Owens was planning the future. She would lead her brood in incursions against prey of the forest, against livestock and cattlemen, against the agents still hunting them. There were plenty of females for her offspring to sire their own brood upon. Cattle, does, ranchers’ wives… the possibilities were endless. And if her offspring failed to find a female when they matured? Well, Owens herself was still fertile. She would happily serve.



Once the thought would have repulsed her. Now it came to her as second nature. With every push and quake as her second pup inched to be born, any old reservations were quieted forever. This was what she was, now. A vessel for brood. A mother to cryptids. A warm pussy, a safe womb, and a spigot, as necessary, to provide blood.



The second pup plopped free. He too was male. She was already blushing at the thought of carrying his offspring. Her sons, her *sins*, they would define her. She didn’t mind. After all, there were plenty of other women to share them with. ",0,1765541850.0,shayy,1,0.5,False

when you buy a coffee, it says “each coffee gives you 8 more energy bars,” but we currently have a 5-bar energy system. does that mean the extra 3 bars are still added on top of the 5, since 5 is the new base?

another thing: if i use a coffee and get 8 bars, then spend a few (let’s say i’m down to 3) and use another coffee, does the energy stack (so i’d have 11 actions), or do the leftover bars get lost? and is there a limit to how many coffees you can use at the same time?

hope this makes sense!",2,1765541708.0,statusAI,1,1.0,False
